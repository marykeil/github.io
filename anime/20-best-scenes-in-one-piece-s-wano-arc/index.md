## Literature Review

From Oden&#39;s epic death to Luffy&#39;s sensational awakening, these are some of the scenes that make the Wano Arc the best in One Piece&#39;s history.





Focusing on the Straw Hats&#39; confrontation with the fearsome Yonko, Kaido of the Beasts, the Wano Arc actually feels sometimes feels like a standalone story that can be enjoyed even by those who have not followed the entirety of One Piece. The struggle of the samurai to free their land from tyranny and avenge the death of their master is a classic tale of drama and revenge that draws heavily from the classics of the genre. Also thanks to great character development and some unexpected plot twists, Wano has entered the running for one of the best arcs in One Piece and these amazing scenes prove why.

 20  The Curtain Rises on Wano 


 







Coupled with Komurasaki&#39;s energetic Shamisen, the opening act of Wano is very different from any other arc in One Piece thus far, and it sets up the comparison between this story arc and a classic Kabuki theatre play. Nonetheless, the opening act racks up the excitement with a brief glance into each of the Straw Hats undercover as well as a few glimpses of the unassuming yet stunning landscape of the Flower Capital. As always, however, chaos follows wherever the Straw Hats go as Zoro is framed as the slasher terrorizing the Capital and ends up fighting the magistrate and his subordinates.





 19  Kanjuro&#39;s Shocking Betrayal 


 







Kanjuro&#39;s betrayal and the subsequent revelation about his Kurozumi lineage were especially saddening after the flashback to Oden&#39;s death and his bond with the Akazaya samurai. Needless to say, neither fans nor the Akazaya expected Kanjuro to be the traitor considering their familial bond and the deep loyalty of the Akazaya to Oden. However, what makes this scene excellent apart from the shock factor is just how menacing and evil Kanjuro appears as he reveals his true colors. Accompanied by the tears of the Akazaya as they reminisce the good times they once shared with him, the scene takes on a bittersweet note.





 18  Luffy Gets Captured: Straw Hats React 


 







Luffy&#39;s inability to follow any form of a plan has been a long-running gag in One Piece. In fact, the Straw Hat crew have even learned to plan around their impulsive captain, taking it as a given that Luffy will do as he pleases, and have even used his unpredictability to their advantage at times like at Whole Cake Island. While Luffy&#39;s capture after attempting to fight Kaido at Kuri is nothing new or amusing, the Straw Hats&#39; reactions to the news is certainly one of the most hilarious and meme-worthy moments of the early part of Wano.

 17  Sanji Reveals His Flashy Germa Powers 


 







Sanji&#39;s long-anticipated Germa powers finally grab the limelight in Wano when Page One attacks the Flower Capital in Episode #925. Sanji&#39;s transformation into Stealth Black, or Soba Mask, as he prefers to call himself is straight out of a superhero comic, complete with a flashy transformation sequence and epic reveal. In classic One Piece fashion, Sanji hilariously cannot help but wonder at the perverted possibilities of his new power, particularly his ability to turn invisible which he dreams of using to sneak into the women&#39;s bath.





 16  The New Shogun of Wano 


 







Momonosuke goes through quite an arc of his own during Onigashima. Not only does he abandon his childhood to save Wano and the Flower Capital by aging himself using Shinobu&#39;s Devil Fruit but he also continually strengthens his resolve to stand strong as Wano&#39;s symbol of hope. Though he may still have the mind of a child, Momonosuke has certainly come a long way by facing his own fears and helplessness to become the man his mother, Toki believed he could be. His journey over the course of Wano reaches its culminating point in this excellent scene where an adult-looking Momonosuke announces Kaido and Orochi&#39;s defeat and confidently proclaims himself the rightful shogun of Wano. Momonosuke&#39;s reveal signals the end of Wano&#39;s long years of suffering and the beginning of a new era.





 15  Luffy Saves Otama 


 







Fans instantly fell in love with the adorable Otama, who is possibly one of the cutest characters in the series which made seeing her mistreated by Holdem and Kaido&#39;s subordinates difficult to watch. Luffy and Otama&#39;s newfound bond really shines through when he punches Holdem without a second thought, enraged at the thought of Otama being hurt so cruelly. That said, aside from the satisfaction of seeing Luffy punch Holdem what truly makes this scene touching is the resemblance Otama sees between Ace and Luffy when the latter uses Red Hawk, which would later be revisited on Onigashima as well.





 14  An Unlikely Friendship Blossoms 


 







Just when fans thought Wano couldn&#39;t possibly have more tears in store the story reveals the beautifully tragic and poignant story of Yamato and Ace and their unlikely friendship. From the confrontation about following one&#39;s heart to the stories shared over a bottle of sake and a campfire, the two&#39;s friendship ends on a bittersweet note when Ace&#39;s vivre card goes up in flames leaving Yamato feeling helpless once again and reminding fans yet again of Ace&#39;s agonizing demise at Marineford.





 13  The Raid on Onigashima Begins 


 







The raid on Onigashima begins on an electrifying note with a cry from Kinemon and the samurai fervently drawing their swords as they brace themselves to take their long-awaited vengeance. Backlit by the beautiful red glow of Onigashima one can&#39;t help but get excited about the raid and the eventual face-off between the Alliance and Kaido. Peppered with some amazing frames and electrifying music, this scene perfectly builds up the anticipation surrounding the attack on Onigashima.





 12  Luffy and Roger&#39;s Shared Dream 


 







Yamato&#39;s flashback to meeting Ace reveals a key piece of information that makes the scene arguably one of the most important scenes of the series thematically. Upon hearing Luffy&#39;s real dream from Ace, Yamato reveals to viewers that Luffy&#39;s dream is one he shared with Gold Roger (and it&#39;s not becoming the Pirate King). While this scene is a simple interaction in the manga, the anime truly turns it into something magical with a beautifully animated sequence that stresses the parallels between Roger and Luffy and the intrigue surrounding this hilariously childish dream.





 11  Oden Wouldn&#39;t Be Oden... 


 







It would be an understatement to say that Oden is one of the most iconic and beloved characters to have come out of the Wano Arc. His charisma and quirkiness quickly captured the hearts of many fans who were left heartbroken by his eventual death. Nevertheless, Oden goes down a legendary man and his death is easily among the best scenes in the Wano Arc. His sheer fearlessness and resolve even in the face of a slow, excruciating death, and the fact that he meets his end with a smile and with his most recognizable lines are what make this scene truly iconic and deserving of a spot on this list.





 10  Law and Kid vs. Big Mom! 


 







Law and Kid&#39;s battle against Big Mom is without a doubt one of the most crucial battles of the Wano Arc and also the most visually- stimulating with a unique color palette that sets it apart as a scene unlike any other in the series. With plenty of flashy, awakened techniques from both Law and Kid as well as Big Mom this scene is truly a treat to the eyes with not a single dull moment. Like many of the Onigashima battles, this one doesn&#39;t shy away from unique positioning and perspectives and has its fair share of impact frames that keep things exciting throughout.





 9  Yasuie&#39;s Sacrifice for Wano 


 







Yasuie&#39;s sacrifice is one of many in Wano&#39;s struggle for freedom but one that continues to haunt audiences throughout the rest of the arc. Yasuie goes out with dignity, smiling and singing as he is executed, behaving very much like the beloved Tonoyasu of Ebisu Town everyone knew him as for the last two decades. The weight of Yasuie&#39;s sacrifice and the importance second chance he created with his death is one that is felt until the very end of Wano. Nonetheless, fans, much like the Akazaya, were left in tears from the evocative scene.





 8  The Akazaya Take Their Twenty-Year-Old Revenge 


 







While this scene does not particularly stand out in terms of animation, the Akazaya&#39;s initial attack against Kaido is arguably one of the most anticipated moments of the Wano Arc from a storytelling perspective. Fans are reminded at once of the several sacrifices and the amount of time it took for the Akazaya to make it this far as well as of the reason for their vengeance. Nonetheless, seeing the Akazaya face Kaido once again after twenty long years is a satisfying sight to behold made all the meaningful by their use of Oden&#39;s signature Two-Sword Style to finally slash Kaido.





 7  The Straw Hats&#39; Toast 


 







This list would be incomplete without this beautiful scene of the Straw Hats outside Onigashima proposing a toast to celebrate their reunion with Jinbe. The scene is oddly reminiscent of the Straw Hats entering the Grand Line at the beginning of the series and the crew&#39;s bright smiles add a much-needed tinge of hopefulness to the story amidst the tragedy and serious tone of the Wano Arc. If the Straw Hats will not add a final member to their crew, as it seems to be the case, this scene marks the completion of Luffy&#39;s long quest for companions.





 6  The Hope-Filled Fire Festival 


 







While the Fire Festival scene gave fans some of the most stunning landscape shots in the series yet, the scene was also a reminder of the heart-wrenching tale of Wano&#39;s misery. From the light reflected in Otoko&#39;s eyes to the breathtaking view of hundreds of lanterns rising up from the Flower Capital like stars, every frame of this scene is bewitching. The lanterns floating off into the sky carry on them the innermost wishes and dreams of Wano&#39;s woeful people who want nothing more than freedom from Kaido and Orochi. Fittingly, the lanterns reach Luffy just as he lands his final, fatal blow on Kaido, paving the way for a beautiful ending to One Piece&#39;s longest battle.





 5  Queen&#39;s Onigashima Concert 


 







Queen&#39;s concert at Onigashima is an excellent example of One Piece&#39;s recent experimentation with its art style and animation. From the opening credits to Queen&#39;s charismatic dance moves and intoxicating stage presence, this scene is by far the most unique one in the series so far. In fact, it can almost be mistaken for a music video with its rave-like neon lights, bright colors, and exhilarating crowd. This scene is also one of the best examples of the excellent job One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc has done at elevating the source material perfectly, and the ability the series has of being lighthearted even during the most dramatic stories.





 4  Sanji vs. Queen 


 







Sanji&#39;s battle against Queen perfectly wraps up his character arc that began in Whole Cake Island by forcing him to finally come to terms with his Germa lineage and his fears of ending up like his heartless siblings. The scene perfectly represents his commitment and loyalty to the Straw Hats and is accompanied by some stellar animation and a one-of-a-kind picturesque art style and color palette for the climax of the battle and Sanji&#39;s flashback of Zeff and the Straw Hats.





 3  Zoro Becomes the King of Hell 


 







From the moment Zoro adapts to using Enma until he defeats King, every second of the scene is absolutely stunning and impossible to take one&#39;s eyes off. Together with Zoro unknowingly using Conqueror&#39;s Haki, this battle between the two first mates over which of their captains will become the King of the Pirates is exciting from start to finish which is a testament to the incredible pacing and direction. This fight, much like the other major fights on Onigashima isn&#39;t afraid to experiment with its art style and the result is an incredibly unique, visually stunning fight sequence unlike anything One Piece has ever produced before.

 2  Luffy Reaches the Rooftop 


 







Fans have heard Luffy claim he&#39;s going to be the next Pirate King maybe a million times over the course of the series. However, no other instance hits as hard as this scene when Luffy finally reaches the rooftop of Onigashima says the iconic lines in front of the two most powerful pirates in the world, after landing a very satisfying punch on Kaido. From Luffy casually walking past the Emperors to Kinemon&#39;s moving tears as he entrusts the fate of Wano to Luffy, this scene is the perfect beginning to Luffy&#39;s long-awaited battle against Kaido.





 1  Luffy&#39;s Awakened Performance 


 







Luffy&#39;s awakening and the debut of Gear Five is without a doubt the best scene in One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc and the climax of Luffy&#39;s long battle against Kaido. From Luffy&#39;s insanely silly attacks and cartoonish reactions to the contagious smile on his face, this scene is truly the peak of One Piece&#39;s animation and storytelling. Considering how massive fans&#39; expectations were regarding Gear 5&#39;s anime debut, it&#39;s safe to say that the series delivered, and more. Nearly every frame of the scene has something unique to offer, be it a stunning shot of Luffy against the moon, a unique expression on Luffy&#39;s face, or an extraordinary impact frame as one of Luffy&#39;s ridiculous attacks hits its mark. Nonetheless, Luffy&#39;s cartoonish antics never get old and this scene is worth every rewatch.
In all, the Wano arc has certainly set higher expectations for One Piece going forward, and with the curtains set to close on the final act of Wano, fans can only hope that the anime continues to surprise and remains just as spectacular throughout the Final Saga. Regardless, these spectacular scenes from One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc prove that the whole saga is definitely worth a rewatch, and highlight just what an amazing journey those four years have been.
