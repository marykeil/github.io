 The Apothecary Diaries&#39; strong cast makes it unforgettable 
          

The lynchpin of the anime is doubtlessly its main character, Maomao, and no one this season is quite like her. A far cry from an earnest, passionate protagonist with big dreams, Maomao is worldly and jaded, keeping her head low to practice medicine and test poisons on herself. Her sarcastic inner monologs are mellow but insightful, and just entertaining to listen to in general. Still, her lethargy is only matched by her mania over medicine, and seeing her squeal over overlooked herbs adds a charm created by this duality. Maomao is entertaining whether her guard is up or down.




          

Still, Maomao&#39;s traits are only improved by pairing her with an excellent supporting cast that puts her in her place. Rear Palace administrator Jinshi and imperial concubine Gyokuyou provide senior figures who can push Maomao&#39;s buttons and keep her grounded, while the young apothecary shows her skills as one of the great anime detectives. Meanwhile, her colleagues, like the other ladies-in-waiting, become victims of Maomao&#39;s jokes, keeping character interactions dynamic. While the Rear Palace has plenty of intrigue, the animators at Toho and OLM have a deft sense of comedy, giving everyone the right expressions to match their feelings.

          




The Apothecary Diaries has a sense of charisma and confidence. The story doesn&#39;t shy away from portraying the realities of a royal harem tied to the emperor of a nation. Aphrodisiacs are a casual topic of one episode, as is the survival of infants who could become future royalty. That this is all seen from the lens of an apothecary who has to solve mysteries with medical expertise only adds to the anime&#39;s peculiarities With three episodes released during its premiere, The Apothecary Diaries has plenty yet to show, and viewers who want something unique this Fall shouldn&#39;t skip out on it.
