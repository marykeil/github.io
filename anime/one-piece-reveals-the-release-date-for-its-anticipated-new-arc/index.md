## Literature Review

The One Piece anime has finally revealed the release date for its exciting new arc, coming after four long years on Wano.




With the finale of the Wano Arc right around the corner, One Piece fans are waiting for the release date for its next arc, Future Island, and the destination for the Straw Hats&#39; thrilling new adventure. As spectacular as Wano has been, fans are certainly ready to leave the island behind and the series has finally given fans a date to look forward to.




After a four-year-long adventure in the land of the samurai, Luffy and his faithful crew, now complete with the addition of Jinbe, will finally continue their journey towards finding the legendary One Piece. According to X user @OP_SPOILERS2023, the new anime arc will kick off this December, and the next island on their map will be none other than Egghead Island, the land of science and innovation.


 

The anime will thus begin adapting the Future Island Arc, which is currently ongoing in the manga, and it&#39;s the first step in the anticipated Final Saga that will, in the upcoming years, bring Luffy&#39;s grand adventure to its conclusion.

                  One Piece Finally Makes a Big Character From Luffy &amp; Shanks&#39; Backstory Canon   The latest episode of One Piece has surprised fans with an unexpected cameo from a major film character confirming her canon existence in the anime.   





 One Piece&#39;s Future Island Arc Will Kick Off The Final Saga 
          

One Piece will begin its newest arc with Episode #1086 on December 3, 2023. The Straw Hats&#39; next adventure will take place on Egghead Island, the land of science and endless futuristic fun, and is sure to have plenty of exciting exploration, unimaginable gadgets, and exhilarating drama and action. The Straw Hats will also meet a key character, that has been teased for a very long time in the series, and with whom manga readers have already become acquainted.

Unfortunately, the anime might also feature a filler episode or two before beginning the new arc, as the Wano arc has almost been completely wrapped up as of Episode #1082 with very little left to be shown. All that remains to be adapted is the revelation of Luffy&#39;s new bounty and the new Emperors, the Alliance splitting up and going their separate ways, and the closing scene of Wano, which in theory should not require more than two episodes.




                  One Piece Filler List: Every Episode You Can Skip   As with any anime series, One Piece comes with a selection of filler episodes. Which adventures aren&#39;t canon, and which One Piece arcs can you skip?   

Episode #1086 will likely begin with the Straw Hats on the sea as they head toward Egghead and will likely adapt the revelation of the Straw Hats&#39; new bounties, along with a surprising conversation about Luffy&#39;s real dream, and an update on several other characters following the closing of Wano, including Sabo. The Straw Hats will most likely actually arrive at Egghead in the episode that follows.

          

Nonetheless, the Straw Hats&#39; next adventure is sure to be entertaining. It will certainly be interesting to witness how One Piece&#39;s anime chooses to bring the many futuristic elements of the Egghead Arc to life and whether the anime will be able to maintain the same standards of excellence as the Wano Arc going forward.
