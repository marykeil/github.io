## Literature Review

Anime series are full of adorable young couples muddling their way through romance for the first time. Here are 10 of the cutest couples from anime.




Though anime fans might associate relationships with classic shojo and romance titles, the cutest anime couples come from a wide range of genres, including classic shonen. In fact, it&#39;s pretty common for shonen series to feature a romantic interest for their lead characters, as well as side characters. Including relationships not only helps the anime to draw in other demographics, but also makes the story feel more real, as these characters grow closer to one another throughout the hardships, trials, and tribulations that they face.
Often, it&#39;s this willingness to stick together through thick and thin that makes many anime couples so cute in the first place. Anime couples also tend to be young and new to love, adding a cute layer of shyness or insecurity that they must work through in order to get together. These couples aren&#39;t always models for great relationships, but they do look awfully cute together and have more than their fair share of adorable moments worth calling out.









 








 10  Izuku Midoriya &amp; Ochako Uraraka 
My Hero Academia (2016) 


 







While Midoriya and Uraraka haven&#39;t quite gotten together yet in the anime, the hints of attraction and their strong friendship have already set Deku and Uraraka up to be a great couple. Uraraka is a caring young girl who worries over Midoriya, who constantly injures himself due to his body being poorly adjusted to his Quirk. In season 6, Uraraka took their relationship forward in a big way by publicly defending Midoriya when the assembled crowds of refugees wanted to chase him off, fearing he might attract villains to their location. By being willing to put herself on the line to give Midoriya a much-needed break, Uraraka proved the depths of her love, even if she hasn&#39;t said it out loud yet.

 9  Kagome &amp; Inuyasha 
Inuyasha (2000)


 







Inuyasha follows Kagome Higurashi, a modern-day fifteen-year-old girl that finds herself transported to the Sengoku period of Japan. There, she meets Inuyasha, who is half-dog demon, half-human. Their fates are bound together by the Shikon Jewel, and the pair are sent off on a quest to recover the shattered pieces of it. Inuyasha and Kagome often face difficulties communicating, as both of them are strong-willed individuals who tend to hide their true feelings. Still, when danger rears its head, the true weight of this couple&#39;s love will rapidly become apparent, and may the gods have mercy on anyone who threatens one of them. In the sequel series Yashahime, Inuyasha and Kagome are married and have a daughter, Moroha.
Fans of Kagome and Inuyasha&#39;s dynamic might also enjoy the anime Kamisama Kiss, which shares similar fantasy elements and follows the romance between Nanami, a regular high schooler, and Tomoe, a fox spirit.
