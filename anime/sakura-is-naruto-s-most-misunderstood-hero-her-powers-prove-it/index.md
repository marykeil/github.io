## Literature Review

Two incredible metaphors in Naruto actually prove just how deep of a character Sakura is and, consequently, how misunderstood and underrated she is.





Naruto actually deconstructs Sakura and Sasuke&#39;s unhealthy dynamic several times through symbolic actions that highlight Sakura&#39;s growth as a woman who&#39;s actually emotionally independent of Sasuke which events might cause fans to believe. Other powerful images are conveyed through impactful metaphors, most notably seen through her backstory that connects a defining part of her character to one of her strongest powers, all in an effort to signify her journey toward personal acceptance more effectively than normal actions alone ever could.





 Sakura&#39;s Strength of a Hundred Seal Has a Hidden Meaning 
          

Aside from how her backstory wasn&#39;t nearly as tragic as her fellow shinobi, Sakura&#39;s past stood out from those of her peers based on how much it revolved around appearances, which initially appeared to reinforce gender stereotypes. However, the way in which the series explores this topic through symbols proves the focus is more than superficial. As revealed in the series, Sakura was once greatly insecure about her forehead and would actively go out of her way to cover it due to bullying from her peers. It&#39;s therefore understandable that when Ino accepted that part of Sakura, the two of them became friends.

Although Ino would later help Sakura accept herself, it&#39;s poetic that Sakura would undergo a rigorous three-year training regime to master a technique that not only involves the use of her forehead but causes a mark to manifest on that part of her body. The Strength of a Hundred Seal allows her to store chakra there so she can perform jutsu without having to waste any of this precious energy, as revealed in Naruto chapter #632 by Masashi Kishimoto.




                  Boruto Foreshadowed a Major Role For Sakura &amp; Tsunade - Theory   Sakura&#39;s daughter Sarada made a rather compelling connection between her mother and Boruto&#39;s villains, and Tsunade is inherently connected, too.   

The Strength of a Hundred Seal sees Sakura utilizing a portion of her body that she was once ashamed of in such a way that enhances her capabilities. The symbol that appears on the forehead after mastering this technique can be worn proudly, showcasing determination, strength, and success. Sakura therefore no longer needs to hide that part of her body, especially given that it now represents something that she&#39;s proud of and likely feels compelled to show off. On another level, this development allows Sakura to achieve one of her earlier hopes when she first befriended Ino. Although Sakura came to appreciate how much Ino&#39;s kindness helped her accept who she was, Sakura still felt the need to differentiate herself from Ino. Sakura&#39;s mastery of the Strength of a Hundred Seal serves as Sakura&#39;s way of accepting herself in an empowering way. The Seal isn&#39;t Sakura&#39;s only symbol of self-acceptance though.






 Sakura&#39;s Hair Liberates Her From Sasuke 
          

Much like Sakura&#39;s Strength of a Hundred Seal, her hair represents much more than just her appearance. Originally, Sakura&#39;s hairstyle actually signified how much of a negative influence Sasuke had on her. When she first learned that Sasuke likes girls with longer hair, Sakura changed herself to meet those standards by growing her hair out. Sakura would keep that particular style for quite some time. But by Naruto chapter #539, Sakura came to the conclusion that having shorter hair would be more conducive to being a successful ninja and cuts her hair in a dramatic scene.

This shows a willingness on her part to make sacrifices for the sake of bettering herself and improving her abilities. It&#39;s telling that, despite her apparent obsession with Sasuke, she made this decision even though it could result in Sasuke finding her less attractive. Sakura changed herself in a way that would later prove to be dangerous, but eventually chose to do what would be better for her in the long run. Much like the Strength of a Hundred Seal, Sakura cutting her hair can be interpreted as a decision to be true to herself. She was no longer going to allow Sasuke to control that aspect of her life regardless of how small it might be.




Of course, it&#39;s easy to point to later events to prove that Sakura was still influenced by Sasuke to the detriment of her character and wellbeing. Undoubtedly, the most obvious example when she married him after he had continuously proven to be undeserving of her love. Even though Boruto has made attempts to make Sasuke worthy of Sakura, real character development isn&#39;t a straight line. Instead of viewing Sakura cutting her hair as the endpoint, it&#39;s best to look at it as a small step toward independence. While powerful, the scene focussing on such a small act is actually what makes it work. Much like her being insecure about her forehead because she was still a child, Sakura couldn&#39;t just get over the unhealthy aspects of her obsession with Sasuke immediately. But cutting her hair to make herself a better ninja was still a pivotal step in the right direction.

Despite the sometimes uncomfortable nature of Sakura and Sasuke&#39;s relationship though, the Sakura who chose to marry Sasuke is much different than the girl who was obsessed with the most popular boy in school. So much like how fans can&#39;t blame Sakura for loving and marrying a person that many feel minimizes herself in the process, they shouldn&#39;t say she has no substance because Naruto has proven through powerful symbols that Sakura is actually an impressively compelling and misunderstood character.
