## Literature Review

SHY episode #4 did a great job of advancing its hero&#39;s character arc, and here&#39;s everything to know about when episode #5 will keep things going.





 What Time SHY Episode 5 Releases 
          




As with previous episodes, SHY streams exclusively on Crunchyroll, which can be accessed on their website and through their app. Episode #5 should premiere on Crunchyroll on Monday, October 30, at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (PST) and 12:00 PM Eastern (EST) in the United States and at 5:00 PM British Summer Time (BST) in the United Kingdom.

                  New Anime is the Superhero &amp; Magical Girl Fusion Fans Didn&#39;t Know They Needed   Despite its superhero mold, SHY&#39;s story structure takes more than a few cues from the Magical Girl genre, which is a welcome twist to the genre.   



 What Happened In SHY Episode 4? 
          

SHY episode #4, “A Heartless Person”, showcased Shy and Stardust’s fight, where Shy, even after unlocking her fire powers, couldn’t hit Stardust thanks to his ability to redirect attacks away from him. As such, Stardust relentlessly beats Shy down, but Shy refuses to give up and even posits that Stardust’s sadism is actually him trying to push Shy to be stronger, thus making him a kind person deep down. That makes Stardust’s heart waver as he remembers how a friend once told him to strive to be kinder than everyone, and Shy manages to get a single hit in before losing consciousness, thus letting her pass the test.




                  Crunchyroll&#39;s New Superhero Anime Fixes One Of My Hero Academia&#39;s Biggest Problems   SHY is a brand-new superhero anime airing on Crunchyroll, and it&#39;s already avoiding a big problem with its major contemporary, My Hero Academia.   

After the fight, Teru wakes up to find Lady Black and Doctor Schwartz, the heroes of Switzerland and Germany, respectively, who treated her wounds and told her that she won the fight. Lady Black then accosted Teru on how much she had been failing as a hero, which Doctor Schwartz said was just her way of telling Teru that she needs to keep working hard, and that leads to Teru telling Iko that she vows to become stronger. The episode ends with Teru watching a news report of another Stigma-related incident in China, with Shrimpy reminding her that she needs to be on her guard.



 SHY Episode 4 Establishes Just How Far Its Hero Needs To Go 
          




One of the biggest takeaways from SHY episode #4 is its establishment of just how far Shy needs to go as a hero. It’s established that it’s a failing on Shy’s part for her to have taken so long to unlock her superpower, so in addition to becoming more confident, Shy needs to find a way to become stronger, in general, if she wants to contribute to the fight against Stigma. That adds a lot to her arc of coming into her own as a hero, and it will be great to see how it plays out in SHY episode #5 and beyond.

Be sure to watch SHY episode #5 when it releases on October 30.
