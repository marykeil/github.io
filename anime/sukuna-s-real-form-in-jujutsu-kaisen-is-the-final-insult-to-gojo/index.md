## Literature Review

Sukuna has finally been reincarnated in Jujutsu Kaisen, and his true form proves the fight against Gojo may have been decided from the start.





Although Sukuna&#39;s true form and appearance have been revealed through flashbacks on multiple instances, fans were left wondering whether his old self might make an appearance in the present day, or whether doing so was even possible for that matter. Fortunately, the latest chapter of Jujutsu Kaisen has finally put the matter to rest with The King of Curses raising the stakes with his long-awaited reincarnation.




                  Jujutsu Kaisen Foreshadowed Gojo&#39;s Death Against Sukuna   In the winner take all battle between Gojo and Sukuna, someone will have to die, and the evidence shows it will be the beloved hero.   


 Sukuna&#39;s Reincarnation Proves Gojo Was Barely a Challenge 
          

Chapter 237 reveals that Kashimo has managed to force Sukuna&#39;s hand into revealing a major ace up his sleeve. Sukuna uses a Cursed Tool created by Yorozu called Kamutoke to restore his body by reincarnating and reclaiming his old, Heian-era form. This secret ace and the fact that Sukuna didn&#39;t use it against Gojo suggests Gojo truly wasn&#39;t able to make Sukuna give the battle his all despite originally seeming like a narrow win.

Though Gojo admitted that he wasn&#39;t able to make Sukuna give the battle his all in chapter 236, Sukuna goes on to prove this claim in chapter 237. Sukuna&#39;s ability to negate the damage to his body from the fight against Gojo with one fell swoop proves that he would have won regardless. Sukuna has kept his cards close throughout the battle at Shinjuku, using both his own abilities and the Ten Shadows strategically, so the presence of yet another ace being in his possession hardly seems surprising. That said, Sukuna&#39;s new form raises many concerns, especially for his vessel Megumi and the sorcerers set to go up against him as it is unclear what abilities and advantages his true form may grant him.




While Megumi&#39;s fate seems dark, only time will tell what Sukuna truly has planned, and whether there is anyone left who can go up against him. The God of Lightning, Kashimo, stands before Sukuna at present to finally get his thousand-year-old rematch, and seems determined to take Sukuna down with him even if he goes down in a blaze of lightning in the process.

Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Viz Media.
