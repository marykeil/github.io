## Literature Review

With three years to train Sasuke, Boruto has mastered a new version of the powerful Rasengan jutsu, which could be the strongest ever.





Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #2 saw Boruto&#39;s arrival and rescuing Sarada from Code and ended with the two about to face off. After quickly taking care of Code&#39;s soldiers, he confronted Code. After failing to convince Code to back off and call off his plan for world destruction, Boruto builds up chakra and prepares a Rasengan. However, it seems that this Rasengan was not the usual one that fans are used to seeing. Though fans don&#39;t know much about the Rasengan Uzuhiko, available evidence suggests its power could be massive.

 Boruto Could Surpass Previous Rasengan Users 
In a short video, Youtube user Rising explains how Rasengan Uzuhiko could be a game changer. Like Boruto&#39;s usual Rasengan, it is invisible. However, Rasengan is usually built up from the hand, but there is chakra enveloping Boruto&#39;s entire body. It looks a lot like Sasuke&#39;s Chidori Nagashi (Chidori current), where he could release lightning around his body, hitting several targets at once. This could be yet another similarity that Boruto now has with Sasuke. Rising also notes some similarities betweent the swirling energy and the techniques used by Hyuga Clan members like Boruto&#39;s uncle Neji, which could be a nice reference to one of Boruto&#39;s two powerful bloodlines. All this combined could make Uzuhiko the deadliest Rasengan ever seen.

If Rising&#39;s theory is true, then Boruto is now a walking Rasengan. He could attack using the jutsu from more than just his hand. He could even extend it to his sword, just like Sasuke did with his Chidori lightning. Besides attacks, Boruto could easily defend against enemies. The surrounding chakra can stop incoming attacks and techniques. While Rasengan is historically an attacking jutsu, Boruto extended the jutsu&#39;s application and made it a defensive one as well. Another way the Rasengan can be used is with Wind Release (which Boruto also possesses), shredding anyone who gets close to Boruto. These defensive capabilities of the Rasengan are perfect against Kawaki&#39;s rods which appear out of nowhere.

Naruto set the precedent when he reinterpreted the Rasengan. Boruto has now followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and made his own Rasengan more powerful. With the help of Sasuke, it&#39;s possible he managed to come up with a brilliant use for what seemed to be a one-dimensional technique. The new technique seems very powerful but could be exhausting in terms of chakra use. With the strength of the original Rasengan, the stealth of Boruto&#39;s version, and the inspiration from Sasuke&#39;s Chidori Nagashi, Rasengan Uzuhiko has the potential to blow all other types of Rasengans out of the water and be Boruto&#39;s strongest Rasengan ever.
