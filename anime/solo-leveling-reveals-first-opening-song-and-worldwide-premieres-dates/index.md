## Literature Review

The first opening of the highly anticipated Solo Leveling has been revealed, and it&#39;s a collaboration between top Japanese and Korean artists.




Solo Leveling, the upcoming anime based on the wildly successful South Korean web novel and webtoon, is going to be one of the hottest titles of the Winter 2023 anime lineup, and its freshly released first opening showcases the quality of the series as a collaboration between Japan and South Korea.




With only two months remaining before the premiere of Solo Leveling, the official website of the anime has released a promotional video that features the opening song. The anime is set to begin in January 2024, and the release date announcement came with a breathtaking trailer.


 

Manhwa, Korean comics, have become much more popular over the years and more and more anime adaptations based off these comics are being announced. With hits like Tower of God and The God Of High School displaying how successful manhwa-based anime can be, Solo Leveling is just the latest addition to the ever-growing portfolio. With how popular the comic was overseas, it was only a matter of time before a project was announced. The anime is almost here, and the catchy opening song proves that it should not be skipped.




                  Solo Leveling Anime Release Date, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know So Far   The Solo Leveling anime has an official release date, along with trailers and visuals showcasing the seriesâ€™ charismatic protagonist, Sung Jin-woo.   


 Solo Leveling Is A Rare Collaboration Between Japan And South Korea 

 

The opening song will be a collaboration between two icons in both Japan and South Korea. Sawano Hiroyuki, who has worked on several fan-favorite anime such as Attack On Titan, Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War, and Blue Exorcist, will work alongside the mega-popular K-pop boy band TOMMOROWxTOGETHER to produce Solo Leveling&#39;s opening song titled &#34;LEveL&#34;. This collaboration is brilliant as it appreciates the source material&#39;s roots in Korea while also acknowledging its Japanese production.

There will also be worldwide premieres in select cities before the airing of the show. Tokyo and Seoul will both receive an exclusive airing of the first two episodes of Solo Leveling on December 10 and, 4 days later, there will be a premiere in Los Angeles. For upcoming anime as popular as Solo Leveling, an exclusive early premiere is fitting to generate as much hype as possible as the official release date closes in. Spearheaded by A-1 Pictures, creators of Sword Art Online, Solo Leveling tells the story of Sung Jinwoo, the world&#39;s weakest hunter (a warrior with supernatural abilities) as he struggles to earn money and survive. After nearly dying, Sung Jinwoo is granted unique powers that turn his life upside down.




          

The hype and anticipation that surrounds the series will catapult Solo Leveling into becoming one of the most popular anime of 2024. The series will also be a rare collaboration between Japan and South Korea, which may open the way for new similar projects in the future. Sparing no effort in recruiting top talent to work on the project, Solo Leveling will continue paving the way for South Korean light novels and manhwa to ascend to global popularity.

Solo Leveling will be released in January 2024 and will stream on Crunchyroll.
