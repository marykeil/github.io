In Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead episode 9, &#34;Treehouse of the Dead&#34;, Akira and his friends finally made it to Akira&#39;s village, only to find the entrance blocked off to keep zombies from getting in. The group is forced to go through the wilderness where they encounter Masaru Kumano, an old man building a treehouse to avoid zombie boars, and Akira gets everyone to help him to cross another item off the bucket list. While doing so, Akira learned that Kumano was forced to kill his son after he became a zombie, and his grief reinforced Akira&#39;s feeling that he had to do something to repay his parents.

                  Massive Crunchyroll Hit Has One Big Problem, &amp; Its Opening Proves It   Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead has had notable production issues almost from day one, and nothing showcases that better than its opening theme.   

After finally making it to the village, Akira reunited with his parents and tried to help them by taking over their chores. However, neither of them found it too bothersome to keep working in their old age, so Akira was left wondering how he could adequately repay them. As all of that was going on, Kanta Higurashi, a misanthropic survivor from Tokyo, approached the zombies with his own group of survivors with the intent of releasing them into the village.






 Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead’s New Villain Is Akira’s Opposite 
          

Not much has been revealed about Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead’s new villain, but it&#39;s easy enough to see Kanta as someone who&#39;s supposed to be Akira&#39;s opposite. Both Akira and Kanta found freedom in the zombie apocalypse, and they both have bucket lists for what they want to do before becoming zombies; but while Akira just wants to have fun, Kanta wants to lash out against the world over the perception that he, specifically, was shunned from society. The two are clearly meant to be foils, and it will be interesting to see how they interact once Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead returns this Christmas.

Be sure to watch Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead episode #10 - 12 when they release on Christmas!
