## Literature Review

Although 2024 has only just started, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End has already produced one of the best EDs of the year using one clever trick.




The year 2024 has just begun but the hit fantasy anime Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End has already produced what is likely to be the year’s best ending theme. This makes sense given the anime’s overall high production value, meaning that every aspect of it is superb in some way. In the case of its ending theme, something many shows don’t put much effort into, it is especially notable.




Frieren’s new ED features a mix of animation styles, starting off like a woodcut drawing and transferring into stop-motion as it shows Frieren&#39;s dreams. This is a gorgeous accompaniment to the beautiful ending song “Anytime Anywhere” by milet. Fans of the show will also recognize this song as being the ending theme for the first half of the season, where it was accompanied by a different animation style.

          

However, this version of the song is slightly different, being taken from a different part of the full version of the tune than the first ending theme. This is a brilliant way to reuse the superb first ending theme in a way that still feels new.


 Frieren Makes its Old ED Feel New 

 




This is especially clever given how well the ending relates to the themes of the show. Frieren is about the consequences of immortality, which makes the melancholic yet hopeful “Anytime Anywhere” feel like a perfect fit for the anime. It also allows the staff of the show to focus more of its attention elsewhere and maintain the high quality present in the series’ first cour. Frieren’s first half was already one of the best fantasy anime of 2023, so maintaining this level of quality will potentially make it one of the best anime in 2024 as well. Either way, this clever shortcut allows Frieren’s ED to easily be in the running for the best ending of 2024.

Unfortunately, many anime don’t put as many resources into their EDs. While the show’s OP can serve to draw new viewers into the anime, the ED mainly serves as a way for viewers to decompress after the episode and many fans skip them entirely if they can. Because of this, many EDs are just nice songs accompanied by bland or static visuals. This makes great EDs like Frieren’s all the more exceptional, as the team behind it clearly put a lot of effort into it. This same level of work was what made Frieren’s first ED the best of 2023.






 Frieren&#39;s ED Perfectly Complements the Themes of the Show 
          

If 2024 continues the general trend of anime neglecting to make their EDs interesting, then Frieren’s will easily become the best of the year. Frieren has been one of the best anime to come out in years, with incredible care and quality put into every detail, so this will be another accomplishment to add to its list. Hopefully, the trick that Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End used to make its ending better will inspire other anime to make their EDs more entertaining in the future.

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End airs new episodes on Crunchyroll on Fridays.
