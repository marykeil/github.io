# Jujutsu Kaisen s Dub Completely Omits One of the Series  Funniest Jokes


## SUMMARY 



  Jujutsu Kaisen is an action-packed anime with intense fights, but also showcases a witty sense of humor, breaking up the intense action with lighthearted moments.   Season 1 had plenty of hilarious moments, especially the funny interaction between Yuji and Todo in episode 19. However, the English dub failed to replicate the comedic magic of the original Japanese version.   The scene became viral within the Jujutsu Kaisen community due to the tongue-in-cheek dialogue and the voice actor&#39;s decision to accentuate an English accent for comedic effect. Unfortunately, the localization team couldn&#39;t fully recreate the joke in the dubbed version, depriving some viewers of the hilarious moment.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen is a supernatural battle anime, but it can be hilarious at times, and the dub version ruined one of the funniest moments in the series.




Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the most action-packed shonen anime to date, with many of the fights turning into intense back-and-forths showcasing the series&#39; unique power system. That doesn&#39;t mean the series can&#39;t venture into characteristics of other genres, though. In fact, Jujustu Kaisen has an incredibly witty sense of humor; from the interactions between Gojo and Nanami to the teasing of Megumi by Itadori, the series does an excellent job at breaking up the intense action with lighthearted moments.




Season 1 had many hilarious moments, mostly because the intense and heart-breaking arcs such as the Shibuya Incident arc hadn&#39;t come to fruition yet. The animation staff enhanced the series by bringing one of the funniest moments between Yuji and Todo to life, but tragically, the English dub didn&#39;t quite replicate the magic.

                  Pushing Shonen Forward - Jujutsu Kaisen Pushes The Boundaries With One Disturbing Scene   Jujutsu Kaisen has always been darker than a typical Shonen series but its latest episode pushes the boundaries on what is acceptable to show.   


 Todo and Yuji&#39;s Bonding Experience Is The Funniest Moment In The Show 
Jujutsu Kaisen Season 1, Episode 19: &#34;Black Flash&#34;

 

In episode 19 of Jujutsu Kaisen season 1, Todo Aoi and Yuji Itadori faced off against the special-grade curse Hanami who infiltrated the school. Determined to make Itadori master cursed energy, Todo told him to fight Hanami by himself until he landed a Black Flash, and wouldn&#39;t help him until then. Throughout the fight, Todo was speaking in English instead of Japanese. Saying empowering phrases like, &#34;My besto friendo!&#34;, the tongue-in-cheek dialogue in the middle of an intense life-or-death battle was amusing, and was one of the funniest moments in Jujutsu Kaisen.




What made the scene even more outlandish is that the voice actor of Todo, Subaru Kimaru, is fluent in English and decided to accentuate an accent for the sake of comedy. It was a great decision, as fans loved it and it became a viral meme within the Jujutsu Kaisen community. However, the fans of the dub just didn&#39;t get the same experience. It wasn&#39;t that the voice actor purposely didn&#39;t do the bit, it was that he couldn&#39;t. Unfortunately, due to the dialectic nature of the original joke, it put the localization team at a major disadvantage when attempting to recreate it.

          

Although there was nobody at fault in the dubbed version, it was still unfortunate that some couldn&#39;t experience the most hilarious moment in the series. With how huge of a franchise Jujutsu Kaisen has become, it&#39;s great to see that the cast and staff had some sort of creative freedom to make the show better. With the Shibuya Incident Arc teasing another team up between Itadori and Todo, viewers hope their humorous dynamic will shine bright once again.




Jujutsu Kaisen is available to stream on Crunchyroll.
