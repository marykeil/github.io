## Literature Review

Pokémon  Horizons kicks off a brand new arc in episode #26, focusing on the mysterious Legendary Pokémon Terapagos. Here&#39;s how best to watch.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          




New episodes of Pokémon Horizons are currently airing exclusively in Japan, on the Japanese channel TVTokyo. Episodes air at 6:55 PM JST, which is equivalent to 2:55 AM Pacific Time and 5:55 AM Eastern Time, making it difficult for Americans who may have access to Japanese TV to watch. Episode 26 is set to air on Friday, October 27, 2023. Since the broadcasts are intended for Japanese audiences, there are also no subtitles, so some knowledge of the Japanese language will be necessary to follow what&#39;s going on. Pokémon Horizons is confirmed for an English dub, currently set to debut in late 2023, but with no specific date available.



 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #25? 
          

Episode #25 represented the climax of the first story arc, known as &#34;Liko and Roy Set Off.&#34; While visiting Liko&#39;s grandmother in search of answers about Liko&#39;s pendant (now transformed into Terapagos), the Explorers attacked the castle, hoping to steal the mysterious Pokémon for themselves. A major confrontation ensued, featuring new villains Sango and Agate destroying much of the building, but the Rising Volt Tacklers managed to escape with Liko&#39;s grandmother in tow. Now safely aboard the airship, Liko was given a journal belonging to the ancient adventurer Lucius, and a new goal: to track down Lucius&#39;s other Pokémon in Ancient Poké Balls.






 Pokémon Horizons Episode #26 Will Put Terapagos in the Spotlight 
          

Pokémon Horizons episode #26 seems to be a bit of a breather episode, with the action confined to the airship as the crew gets underway once again. The episode is entitled &#34;Terapagos&#39;s Adventure,&#34; and focuses on Terapagos wandering off aboard the ship and getting into trouble. Liko&#39;s grandmother, Diana, is also still on board and seems to be bringing new energy to the ship. It&#39;s not clear how long Diana might remain on the airship, but she likely can&#39;t return to her home after all the destruction of the last episode. Diana has proven to be a likable character, however, so a longer-term presence in the show would be welcome.

With a new arc getting ready to start and a firm new goal for the series&#39; heroes, Pokémon Horizons is in a good place. It&#39;s hard to believe that the story has already progressed as much as it has, compared to the slow pacing of most of the anime storylines featuring Ash. It goes to show that this series is very different from its predecessor, with more focus on plot and large-scale story. Its new story arc structure is also a big change from the previous anime, and helps to break what&#39;s sure to be a long-running series up into more manageable chunks. Pokémon Horizons has surpassed many expectations in its first arc, and here&#39;s hoping that the new arc beginning in episode #26 will be just as good.
