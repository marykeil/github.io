## Literature Review

From Studio Ghibli movies like Howl&#39;s Moving Castle to cozy series like Non Non Biyori, cottagecore anime gives an irresistible slice of rural life.





Anime has been reveling in the simple joys of rural life long before the term cottagecore appeared, with Studio Ghibli movies like Howl&#39;s Moving Castle and Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service the most famous examples, as well as constituting some of the best anime movies ever made. Along with rural slice-of-life series like Non Non Biyori and Natsume&#39;s Book of Friends, there&#39;s no shortage of amazing cottagecore anime to begin enjoying right now.

 Anne Of Green Gables 
Currently Unavailable To Stream
        

L.M. Montgomery&#39;s classic children&#39;s novel has also been considered a cottagecore text, so it&#39;s no surprise that this anime adaptation also contains all of the hallmarks of the aesthetic. Just like the book, it centers on the red-headed orphan Anne after she&#39;s mistakenly sent to live with a couple on a farm in place of a boy that they&#39;d hoped would help out in the fields.
However, it proves to be the perfect twist of fate, as Anne takes to her new life in the small farming community. A charming low-stakes anime about finding one&#39;s place in a cozy rural setting, Anne of Green Gables encapsulates the appeal of the cottagecore aesthetic in a simple but charming tale. Due to its age, the animation might be a little too dated, but Ghibli fans may also find it worth a watch thanks to the involvement of future Grave of the Fireflies director, Isao Takahata.





 Flying Witch 
Available On Crunchyroll
        

For fans of Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service and similar cottagecore media with a witchy twist, Flying Witch might just be the perfect show. It centers on Makoto Kowata, a trainee witch who has just reached the age where she must leave home to study witchcraft in the wide world. Along with her black cat Chito, she leaves for Aomori, a region where the abundance of nature makes it ideal for practicing magic.
Whilst there might be better supernatural slice-of-life anime series out there, Flying Witch thrives because of its likable cast of characters and the eccentricities of the magical world that Makoto is forced to deal with whilst learning the craft. It might not have the highs or the idyllic beauty of Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, but Flying Witch has just the right amount of quirkiness to be a great cottagecore series.







 Hakumei And Mikochi 
Available On HiDive
        

There are plenty of anime out there that would make the viewer wish to live in the countryside but Hakumei and Mikochi is perhaps unique for being a series that will leave the viewer wishing they lived in a little house at the base of an old tree. The show is subtitled Tiny Little Life in the Woods and that&#39;s exactly what it portrays as the two titular central characters are both just a few inches tall.
Anime is known for its cute animal sidekicks and Hakumei and Mikochi is no exception, with the woodland creatures that inhabit the forest as well as its other tiny inhabitants making for the perfect companions on a slice-of-life glimpse at their ideal life. Along with great art and music, the series is the perfect laidback experience for fans of the cottagecore aesthetic and its lack of drama only makes it more appealing.





 Non Non Biyori 
Available On Crunchyroll
        

Anime with a cottagecore feel tend to make for short glimpses into rural life but, with four seasons, side stories, and a movie, Non Non Biyori is perfect for viewers that want a slightly longer stay in a peaceful and natural world. Its premise sees main character Hotaru Ichijou transported from urban life in Tokyo to a remote village in the Japanese countryside with none of the conveniences of city life.
Non Non Biyori is the ultimate laid-back slice-of-life anime to relax to, as just like its young protagonist, the viewer comes to appreciate the advantages of living far away from the city. There may be deeper and more well-written series around but Non Non Biyori is the extended getaway to the countryside that many people wish for and its gentle sense of humor is just another reason to keep watching.

 The Ancient Magus&#39; Bride 
Available On Crunchyroll
        

Though not every cottagecore anime necessarily needs to feature an actual cottage, it helps that Elias Ainsworth, the titular Magus, has one of the most picturesque homesteads around in The Ancient Magus&#39; Bride. In the series, a 15-year-old Japanese girl called Chise Hatori is sold at an auction to the darkly mysterious Magus and taken to his beautiful home to become his apprentice and supposedly his bride.
There are plenty of anime about being transported to a magical world, but what makes The Ancient Magus&#39; Bride a uniquely cottagecore experience is its rural English setting where the Magus lives and its basis in western fantasy. With fairies and magical creatures in abundance, it&#39;s fair to say that The Ancient Magus&#39; Bride presents an idealized version of the countryside but that&#39;s also its strongest appeal.





 Silver Spoon 
Available On Funimation
        

At the heart of the cottagecore aesthetic is the dream of getting away from the hectic nature of urban life and escaping out into the countryside, and that also happens to be the exact premise of Silver Spoon. The series is centered on Yuugo Hachiken, a high-school student worn down by impossibly high expectations at school who decides to enroll in an agricultural school instead.
Whilst there are plenty of great anime about owning a pet, Silver Spoon sees its protagonist forced to get really familiar with farm animals, even learning the ins and outs of their physiology. Although it&#39;s a show that has some of the rural trademarks fans expect from cottagecore and is full of countryside imagery, it&#39;s primarily a comedy that gently pokes fun at how useless anyone new to that lifestyle would end up being.

 Howl&#39;s Moving Castle 
Available On Max
        

No studio has made a greater contribution to cottagecore anime than Studio Ghibli, and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle is one of its most iconic tales. To those that appreciate cottagecore, young Sophie Hatter&#39;s simple life at the beginning of the movie may seem perfect as she works hard helping to craft hats by hand in her family&#39;s shop and is content in her work. However, a fateful encounter with an evil witch leaves her in the body of an elderly woman.
Though it isn&#39;t considered director Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s best movie in terms of storytelling, Howl&#39;s Moving Castle is a beautiful and ambitious tale that rejoices in the magic of the every day, as well as the more obviously wondrous elements like Howl&#39;s creaking, steam-powered castle that walks along a beautiful natural landscape on metal legs. As Sophie accompanies Howl to try and cure her curse while a raging war threatens the peace of their land, Joe Hisaishi&#39;s sweeping score makes for the perfect accompaniment.







 Natsume&#39;s Book Of Friends 
Available On Funimation
        

There&#39;s an entire subgenre of anime involving shows that focus on giving the audience a peaceful, relaxing experience and often focus on a connection with nature. Natsume&#39;s Book Of Friends is one of the best examples and it also happens to be an ideal series for fans of the cottagecore aesthetic. Protagonist Takashi Natsume might not fit in with people, but his ability to see strange creatures called Yokai gives him a unique connection to nature.
A gently uplifting slice-of-life series, Natsume&#39;s Book Of Friends adopts an episodic format that sees Natsume helping out various yokai, which leads to plenty of simple heartwarming moments. Although the plot and character development might be too slow for some, the series only gets better across its six-season run and the beautiful natural backdrops mean every episode is an escapist treat anyway.

 Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service 
Available On Max
        

One of the appeals of cottagecore is the idea of healing by returning to simple, natural things and that&#39;s also a theme at the heart of Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service. Sent out into the world at 13 years old in order to become a proper witch, Kiki quickly finds work in the small town of Koriko by plying her trade as a flying delivery service for the bakery that takes her in when she first arrives.
What makes its anime setting so unique is the way Koriko feels like a real place, full of the old-fashioned hustle and bustle of people plying their trades but even that isn&#39;t the primary reason Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service is almost the perfect cottagecore anime. Instead, it&#39;s a section that sees her escape to the remote log cabin of an artist she meets called Ursula that will really scratch the cottagecore itch for anyone that has ever dreamed of living in a little house in the woods.





 Only Yesterday 
Available On Max
        

Whilst Miyazaki&#39;s Studio Ghibli movies often contain cottagecore elements, it&#39;s actually director Isao Takahata whose idyllic vision of countryside life really stands out in one of the most underrated Ghibli movies. Rather than a child protagonist, Only Yesterday centers on the adult Taeko Okajima, an independent woman who&#39;s badly in need of a break from working life in the metropolis of Tokyo.
Accompanied by memories of her childhood self, she escapes to the countryside to live with her relatives and experience what it&#39;s really like to be a working farmer there. What makes Only Yesterday the perfect cottagecore movie is that it actually engages with and discusses what makes countryside life so unique in a thought-provoking way. At the same time, the nostalgic imagery of life in rural Japan is addictive and a heartwarming ending caps things off perfectly. Only Yesterday is a perfect anime for any fan of cottagecore.
