## Literature Review

Even anime fans who have grown tired of the increasingly popular isekai theme are sure to enjoy these titles, thanks to their unique twists and ideas.




The isekai trend has redefined the anime landscape in recent years, with a plethora of increasingly more absurd titles being released each year. After all, the premise of transporting a relatable, realistic character into a unique, fantastical world inherently allows for a certain level of creative freedom, making it interesting for fans and creators alike. Naturally, 2023 is no different, providing fans with plenty of options in terms of the best isekai anime.
When it comes to trends, a surge in popularity often leads to an overcrowded market, which is exactly what happened to the isekai theme. With creators having to constantly come up with new angles and twists for their stories, it only makes sense that some would end up more uninspired than others, resulting in easily forgettable works. However, by successfully avoiding common pitfalls and worn-out tropes, each of these titles provides an original and entertaining experience, distinguishing them from the rest.









 








 10  The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World Recontextualizes the Typical Isekai Hero 
Produced by Studio Blanc and Based on the Light Novel by Kosuzu Kiichi &amp; Sisoe
        

Haruyoshi Kuga was a legendary exorcist, whose unbridled greed for power brought about his own downfall, as he was deemed too dangerous to be kept alive. Instead of simply accepting his demise, he used a self-developed reincarnation technique, determined to live his next life in a more inconspicuous manner, so as not to draw unnecessary attention. Now living as Seika Lamprogue in a world of magic, he uses his exorcism techniques and shikigami to overcome challenges without standing out.
While this may seem like a generic title at first, The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World distinguishes itself through its unique protagonist. Unlike typical isekai protagonists, Seika is sly, intelligent, and mature, calculating all of his moves and never taking advantage of anyone, nor abusing his powers senselessly. Moreover, the other characters are equally interesting, and the story is surprisingly engaging.

Before he can even make sense of his new surroundings, Corpse God finds himself targeted by new, unknown enemies, against whom he is forced to reveal his powers, in turn attracting the interest of unexpected allies.
Approaching a saturated genre from a new angle, the innovative reverse isekai Dead Mount Death Play is sure to surprise fans with its compelling story and intriguing characters.

By easily cooking otherworldly meals that attract even the attention of mythical beasts and goddesses, Mukouda&#39;s journey in his new world becomes that much more fascinating.
