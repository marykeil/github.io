# Luffy s Gear 5 Hides A Connection To Another Huge One Piece Mystery


## SUMMARY 



  Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 in One Piece has a connection to Binks&#39; Sake that hints at a deeper mystery in the series.   Luffy&#39;s transformation into Joyboy and his quote in Gear 5 suggest that Nika and Joyboy may be connected to the iconic song and its larger significance.   The observation that Luffy&#39;s line in Gear 5 matches lyrics from Binks&#39; Sake opens up new possibilities for the overall lore and story of One Piece.

## Literature Review

One Piece is consolidating two of its most important mysteries together by subtly tying Luffy&#39;s Gear Fifth to what could be the final treasure itself.




Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 in One Piece is already a major revelation on its own, but its subtle connection to another series mystery - the final treasure itself - makes it even more significant than fans think. The series&#39; author Eiichiro Oda is well known for his intricately constructed and lore heavy plot, so this should come as no surprise. After all, he has been building to this connection for the entire manga.




Throughout most of the manga, fans and most of One Piece&#39;s characters thought that Luffy had eaten the Gum Gum Fruit, giving him a rubber body that he could stretch and deform in a variety of ways. However, in Wano it was revealed that the true identity of Luffy&#39;s Devil Fruit was the Mythical Zoan Human Human Fruit, Model: Nika.

          

fter awakening this fruit and unlocking the incredibly powerful Gear 5, Luffy was able to distort reality around him and fight in whatever manner he pleased. This Fruit is based off of a mythical Sun God in One Piece&#39;s world, who is also tied to the mysterious Joy Boy. One of Luffy&#39;s lines while in Gear 5 hints that it may also be connected with another major One Piece mystery by extension.


 Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 is Connected to Binks&#39; Sake 

 




On Twitter, user @newworldartur pointed out that during his time fighting Kaido in Gear 5, Luffy says the line, &#34;After you die, all that’s left is bones”. This line is also a part of the iconic song Binks&#39; Sake, which plays an important role in Brooks&#39; backstory and the larger world of One Piece at large. Some fans (especially Artur) have even suggested that Binks&#39; Sake is actually the One Piece itself. Even if it isn&#39;t the One Piece, it has been around for quite some time, being a well known sea shanty. If Luffy&#39;s line in Gear 5 actually came from him channeling the knowledge of Nika or Joy Boy, this would imply that those entities knew it as well, or were potentially involved in events that inspired the song.

This brilliant observation opens up a lot of new possibilities for how Binks&#39; Sake ties into the overall lore of the story. Oda is too intentional of an author to have this be a coincidence after all, and having Nika or the mysterious Joy Boy know the song would likely be an important part of their overall story in the series. It also implies that whoever Binks was may have been related to their general mission of liberating the oppressed people of the world. He could have either been one of their companions, like Zunesha, was or he could have potentially been a holder of the Fruit himself.






 Gear 5&#39;s Connection With Binks&#39; Sake Could Confirm a Huge Theory About The Final Treasure 
          

Answers surrounding the Binks&#39; Sake mystery are likely still a long way off despite the series being in its final chapter. However, this connection means they will likely be revealed if the manga shows readers a Joy Boy flashback. In the meantime, this connection between Gear 5 and Binks&#39; Sake gives One Piece fans another exciting thing to speculate over and theorize on as the series marches ahead to its conclusion.
