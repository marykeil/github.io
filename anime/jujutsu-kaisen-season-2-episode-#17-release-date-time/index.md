## SUMMARY 



  Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #17 will be released on November 16 and fans are eagerly anticipating whether it can meet the high standards set by the previous episode&#39;s incredible fights.   The previous episode showcased intense battles between Megumi and his villainous father Toji, as well as Jogo and Sukuna. The animation in these fights was exceptional and highly praised.   Episode #17 will continue from the cliffhanger of episode #16, with a mysterious powerful new character introduced and potentially impacting the arc&#39;s progression. The animators at MAPPA are expected to deliver another incredible installment, even though surpassing episode #16 would be a feat in itself.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #17 will be hard-pressed to top the awesome fights of episode #16 but it will still likely be incredible.




After the incredible fights in episode #16, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #17 has a high standard to meet. However, with powerful characters like Sukuna still at large, the arc is now pretty unpredictable, enabling it to potentially meet this standard of quality in unexpected ways. Based on the enigmatic end of episode #16, it looks like a powerful new character may have been introduced to Shibuya as well.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #17 Releases 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #17 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, November 16. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 16 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #16? 
          




Episode #16 used its first half to mainly focus on the fight between Megumi and his brilliantly resurrected villainous father Toji. The battle was absolutely brutal, with Toji&#39;s incredible physical abilities enabling him to dismantle the various Cursed animals Megumi summoned to aid him. However, after pushing Megumi to his limits, Toji realized that his opponent was his son, and so he ended the fight by jamming his weapon through his head. The rest of the episode focused on the epic fight between Jogo and Sukuna. While all Jogo had to do was land one hit on Sukuna, the overwhelming power of the King of Curses stopped everything the special grade threw at him. He then ended the fight by ironically killing Jogo with a powerful fire attack.



All these fights had some of the best animation of the season.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #17 Will Follow Up #16&#39;s Cliffhanger 
          




Almost as an afterthought at the end of episode #16, Jujutsu Kaisen showed a hulking white figure marching towards Shigemo while Megumi lay bleeding on the ground. This figure will likely be important at the start of episode #17, and may even be a powerful new character in the arc. If this is the case it could cause problems for the various sorcerers in Shibuya still trying to rescue Gojo or it could provide another opponent for Sukuna to face. Either way given the terror Shigemo experienced facing it, that enemy sorcerer will likely be finally defeated before that mysterious figure has a major impact on the arc.

While it will be hard to outdo the incredible fights and animation of episode #16, if the animators at MAPPA continue to craft the brutal Sukuna scenes at the arc&#39;s finale with the care they deserve, then it will still be an incredible installment. The latest episodes of the Shibuya incident have lived up to the hype of the arc and even a bad episode at this point wonâ€™t diminish the overall quality of the season. However, it would be great if Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #17 does manage to somehow surpass episode #16 against all odds.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #17 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 16, 2023.
