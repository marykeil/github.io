## Literature Review

WWE superstar Zelina Vega spoke to Screen Rant about her personal selection of holiday gifts for fans of anime, whether they&#39;re new or old.




Zelina Vega is a WWE superstar, a member of the LWO, and a co-host of the ZelvX and Charlie Girl podcast. On top of her many passions and talents, she is also a diehard fan of anime. Vega’s enthusiasm for anime is no passing interest; it&#39;s a significant part of her identity. Whether it be on her socials, her stream, her podcast, and even her ring attire, her love of anime like Demon Slayer and Naruto is apparent and has always been a part of her life.




In a recent interview with Screen Rant, Vega shared that her entry into the fandom began in her childhood. &#34;I think psychologically there&#39;s something to remembering a time where everything as a kid was like puppies and rainbows, before reality hit you.&#34; She explained, &#34;I was super, super into Pokemon. I liked Sailor Moon, but I didn&#39;t like her [specifically]. I liked Sailor Mars because Sailor Moon was a crybaby, and I hated her.&#34;

 The Ultimate Anime Gift Guide Inspired By Zelina Vega 
With the holiday season in full swing, Zelina Vega shares her insights and provides a fantastic anime gift guide for weebs, old and new, to pick the perfect gifts. Based on Zelina&#39;s suggestions, here&#39;s her curated anime gift guide:

          

Naruto Shippuden Akatsuki Throw Blanket
For those starting their anime journey, Vega recommends an 

anime-themed blanket
, noting that she once received and loved an Akatsuki Blanket from 

Naruto
, blending comfort with fandom.




If it&#39;s something you&#39;re starting out with, I actually remember Asuka gifted this to me at one point, but it was an Akatsuki Blanket. It&#39;s like you want to be comfy and cozy during the holidays, but you also want to rep the squad.




         




Anime-Inspired Mugs and Socks
Mugs and socks with anime prints, 

available at Box Lunch
, are a hit for Vega. Practical and fun, these items make for excellent stocking stuffers or small gifts.




I am a big mug person... And I love socks. I&#39;m a really, really big sock person.




Replicas
For the more dedicated fan, Vega suggests replicas from a favorite anime, such as the detailed 

Death Note replica
 she owns.




I&#39;m a big fan of Death Note. But this is actually something that I got on Etsy. That is the exact, page for page, Death Note.




         

 High-End Anime Statues

For a more luxurious gift, Vega recommends 




high-end anime statues
, especially if you know the recipient&#39;s favorite anime or character.




Definitely a statue, for sure, if you know what their favorite anime is. Even better if you know their favorite character.




Custom Anime-Inspired Electronics
Vega also appreciates 

customized items
 like her anime-themed computer, showcasing her favorite characters in a unique and personal way.




The whole reason I&#39;m talking to you on this computer is because [my husband] got this computer custom, and it has — I call them my anime zaddies — Rengoku, Sesshōmaru, and Itachi.




Zelina Vega&#39;s anime gift guide offers a range of ideas that cater to both new and die-hard distinguished weebs. Her suggestions are not just gifts but tokens of appreciation for the rich and imaginative world of anime.
