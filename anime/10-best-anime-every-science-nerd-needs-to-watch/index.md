## Literature Review

These anime prove that science can be fun and fascinating and thus should appeal to any science nerds looking for a great show to watch.




While many anime flout the rules of science in favor of bombastic powers, there are some anime that every science nerd would enjoy. These shows either focus on a scientific topic or show the joy of the scientific process. They also do this while providing an entertaining story to watch.
Of course, many anime in the science fiction genre would seem to fit this bill, but in actuality, while they often do base their concepts on real scientific theories, these shows can end up effectively being fantasy series with a scientific flavor. These can end up being more frustrating than enjoyable for science nerds, despite ostensibly containing a lot of science. However, sometimes a rare gem that accurately reflects the science it&#39;s based on comes along and is a joy to watch. These are the ten best shows for science nerds to watch.









 








 10  Insomniacs After School Uses Space as a Romantic Backdrop 
Based on the manga by Makoto Ojiro
        

Insomniacs After School is a romance anime that largely uses a scientific topic as an excuse to draw the two leads together. The anime focuses on Nakami and Magari, two high school insomniacs who revive their school&#39;s astronomy club in order to have a place to be at night. While astronomy isn&#39;t the main focus of the series, it still produces some stunning images that capture the beauty of space pretty well. Thus space nerds should find a lot here to like despite the main focus of the series being a budding young romance.

 9  Spice and Wolf Delves Into Economics 
Based on the Light Novels by Isuna Hasekura and Ju Ayakura
        

Unfortunately for economics nerds, few shows actually dive deep into economic theory. Spice and Wolf is one of the rare exceptions and it is excellent. The anime follows a merchant named Kraft who encounters a wolf goddess named Holo who teams up with him. Holo and Kraft&#39;s growing relationship is fun to watch and the plot actually dives deep into the merchant trade using real-world economic principles. While this may make the show seem esoteric, it actually does a great job at presenting these principles in a way that’s easy to understand. Spice and Wolf is enjoyable for any anime fan, but for economic nerds, it is a must-watch.

 8  Psycho-Pass Applies Technology to Policing 
Written by Gen Urobuchi
        

Sci-Fi shows can often become too high concept, disconnecting from the scientific principles they are based on. Luckily Psycho-Pass largely avoids this trap, starting off as more of a grounded detective show in the vein of movies like Minority Report and Blade Runner. It follows a rookie cop Akane Tsunemori as she joins an organization designed to stop crimes before they even happen. Eventually, it would introduce certain twists and plot points that would strain the limits of believability, but its initial premise and episodes are so compelling it is easy to look past these flaws.

 5  Planetes is a Realistic Look at the Future 
Based on the manga by Makoto Yukimura
        

Planetes is probably the most realistic sci-fi anime. It follows a group of crew members on a ship cleaning up debris floating around Earth. Watching the main character Ai both learn more about her new job and also get to know each of the other fascinating crew members is very rewarding. The story is incredibly grounded despite its sci-fi setting and has a deep focus on character exploration reminiscent of the historic Vinland Saga, another anime based on a manga by Makoto Yukimura. This is a great watch not just for astronomy nerds and futurists, but also anyone who loves character-driven stories.
Planetes is currently not available to stream.





 4  Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It Makes Science Funny 
Based on the manga by Alifred Yamamoto
        

Most comedies don&#39;t focus much on science, but Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a delightful exception. The show follows two scientists Himuro and Yukimura who develop romantic feelings for each other but then try to prove it scientifically. This not only displays the scientific method in an innovative way, but it also pokes fun at taking science and logic to an extreme. While it may not incorporate science in a standard way, Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is still a blast for science nerds to watch.

 3  Cells at Work! Teaches Fans About The Human Body 
Based on the manga by Akane Shimizu
        

Cells at Work! is a delightfully educational show about the inner workings of the human body. It follows a red blood cell who goes about her job and encounters various other cells at work. The setting and premise of the show is easily the most compelling part of this anime, but that isn’t a bad thing. While every cell is personified, the series is actually surprisingly accurate when it comes to depicting bodily functions. This makes Cells at Work! a blast to watch both for biology nerds and for viewers wanting to learn more about how the human body works. Doctors have approved of Cells at Work!&#39;s portrayal of anatomy as well!

Based on the Visual Novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus


 







Steins;Gate is a sci-fi thriller involving the invention of a time machine. The way the series handles time travel makes it unique among similar stories that use the concept.
