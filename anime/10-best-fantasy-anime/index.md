## Literature Review

The best fantasy anime make the most of the limitless creative possibilities found in the genre to tell stories in memorable worlds.




The best fantasy anime truly make the most of the limitless creative possibilities found in the genre to tell some of the most iconic stories in some of the most memorable fictional worlds ever. From traditional sword and sorcery, to isekai, to series that defy classification, anime and fantasy go hand in hand.
Fantasy anime clearly demonstrates the conceptual diversity that exists withinin the genre. Some fantasy anime are set in stylized, magical versions of the real world. Others are set in unique fictional worlds built from the ground up by the author. Whatever the exact form of the world these anime are set in and whatever adventures the characters are undertaking, they have gone down as classics of the genre.









 








 10  Berserk (1997) - Studio OLM 
Based on the Manga Created By Kentaro Miura


 







  Year Released   1997    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Currently unavailable to stream    
Berserk is a serious contender for most popular and iconic dark fantasy manga of all time. Various arcs of the original manga have been adapted into anime series in the 90s and 2010s, but the majority of the Berserk manga has not yet been adapted. Helped by a phenomenal soundtrack by Japanese electronica artist Susumu Hirasawa, the 1997 Berserk anime is widely regarded as a classic. Despite that classic status though, what holds Berserk back is its lack of a real ending. Whether it was setting up a second season that was never made or was just trying to boost manga sales, it&#39;s tough to say, but regardless the end result is unsatisfying. Still, fans of fantasy would be missing out by not watching the 1997 Berserk anime.
The original manga is probably the ideal way to experience the story of Berserk, though its unwaveringly bleak tone and frequent dark, disturbing subject matter mean that it can be a hard series to get through. 






 9  Record of Lodoss War - Studio Madhouse 
Based on the Novel Series Created By Ryo Mizuno
        

  Year Released   1990    Number of Episodes   13    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
Record of Lodoss War is one of the best Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style fantasy anime ever, and a large reason for that is the fact that the story actually began life as transcriptions of author Ryo Mizuno&#39;s tabletop game sessions with his friends. Eventually, he reworked these into a series of light novels which received a 13-episode anime adaptation in the early 90s, followed by the not-quite-sequel, not-quite reboot Chronicles of the Heroic Knight in 1998.
Keeping in mind that Lodoss War is 30 years old and the fantasy genre has changed a lot since the early 90s, the series can feel pretty generic, as it relies on playing a lot of archetypal characters and plot devices completely straight. Even so, it&#39;s very well done, and it comes across as a refreshingly sincere and straightforward high fantasy story given how many modern fantasy anime are now based on satire and subverting expectations.

 8  The Rising of the Shield Hero - Studio Kinema Citrus 
Based on the Light Novel Series Created By Aneko Yusagi &amp; Minami Seira
        

  Year Released   2019    Number of Episodes   44    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
The isekai genre has become widespread enough that the best isekai anime do something unique with the concept to stand out as truly memorable. The Rising of the Shield Hero is notable for being much darker than the typical isekai story. While it&#39;s never as intense as something like Berserk or other markedly dark anime series, Shield Hero is still solidly a dark fantasy story that presents a fairly cynical take on both fantasy worlds in general and the isekai genre specifically. The tone may be enough to turn some viewers off the series, but it&#39;s undeniably a different spin on isekai anime.
The Rising of the Shield Hero depicts many sensitive subjects that some anime fans may be uncomfortable with, so discretion is advised.

 7  Fairy Tail - A-1 Pictures 
Based on the Manga Created By Hiro Mashima
        

  Year Released   2009    Number of Episodes   328    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
The most remarkable thing about Fairy Tail is how diverse its magic system is. The setting of Fiore is dominated by magical guilds and every major character is technically considered a wizard. While there&#39;s certainly an established archetype for wizards in the genre, Fairy Tail largely presents its wizards as everything but the archetype. Natsu and Gray are basically martial artists whose fighting styles use fire and ice respectively, Erza has a seemingly limitless supply of magic armor. Similarly, the minor members of the Fairy Tail guild as well as the various antagonists are all given unique visual designs and magical abilities. It&#39;s a clear demonstration of the creative mind of author Hiro Mashima.
Fans of Fairy Tail may want to check out Mashima&#39;s other well-known manga series, Edens Zero.

 6  KonoSuba - Studio Deen 
Based on the Light Novel Series Created By Natsume Akatsuki
        

  Year Released   2016    Number of Episodes   20 &#43; 2 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Short for Kono Subarashii: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World, KonoSuba is a classic of comedy isekai. Like many isekai series, KonoSuba is set in a fantasy world that operates under the logic of a video game or tabletop RPG. KonoSuba commits fully to its RPG roots in order to highlight the setting&#39;s inherent absurdity. The minor characters never really clue into just how ridiculous their world is. Conversely, the primary protagonists are all savvy enough to recognize many of the peculiarities of the game-based world, outwardly inept enough to repeatedly and hilariously fail to take advantage of them, but good enough at lateral thinking to finally prevail in unexpected ways.

 5  Slayers - E&amp;G Films 
Based on the Light Novel Series Created By Hajime Kanzaka &amp; Rui Araizumi
        

  Year Released   1995    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Funimation    
Slayers is one of anime&#39;s best examples of how to successfully combine humor and action. The fictional world of Slayers is fairly generic, but the setting is perfect for the series&#39; irreverent tone. The generic fantasy setting allows the characters&#39; bombastic and satirical personalities to lampoon many of the beloved aspects of the fantasy genre in hilarious ways. At the same time, the characters get embroiled in legitimately compelling action and adventures, with the fate of the entire world of Slayers at stake. Both the satirical self-aware humor and unironic fantasy action are executed remarkably well.

 4  One Piece - Toei Animation 
Based on the Manga Created By Eiichiro Oda


 







  Year Released   1999    Number of Episodes   1080&#43;    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, Pluto TV    
One Piece is the best-selling series of all time and one of the longest-running anime. By default, this makes it one of the most popular fantasy works ever. Although One Piece doesn&#39;t share a lot with Lord of the Rings or Dungeons &amp; Dragons-influenced fantasy works, it is still fundamentally a fantasy story at its heart. The adventures of the Straw Haw Pirates take them all around a fictional world that operates with its own unique roles and logic, cultures, and governments. One Piece may not be typically fantasy-styled, but Eiichiro Oda has created one of the most unique, creative, and memorable fictional worlds in all pop culture.

 3  Princess Mononoke - Studio Ghibli 
Original Anime Created By Hayao Miyazaki &amp; Studio Ghibli


 







  Year Released   1997    Runtime   133 Minutes    Where to Stream it   Max    
While there is a lot of nostalgia towards Princess Mononoke from the millennial audience who saw it as kids when it was first released, Princess Mononoke is still a classic, even when detached from that sense of nostalgia. The English script for Princess Mononoke was written by beloved author Neil Gaiman, who did a fantastic job adapting the story for an English-language audience while still working within Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s strict no-cuts policy put into place after the original English release of Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind.
Princess Mononoke is a beautiful film, both artistically and thematically. The designs of the animals and monsters are both majestic and horrifying, often at the same time. The plot of the film is driven by a powerful environmentalist and pacifist theme.

 2  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Studio Bones 
Based on the Manga Created By Hiromu Arakawa


 







  Year Released   2009    Number of Episodes   64    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is viewed by many fans as one of the best anime of all time, if not the single best anime of all time. Although the series&#39; setting of Amestris resembles post-industrial revolution Germany with fairly understated fantasy elements, at least superficially, alchemy obviously plays a major role in the plot. Series creator Hiromu Arakawa clearly put a lot of thought into the system behind how exactly the magic system behind the series&#39; alchemy works. The alchemy system is complex but internally consistent, drawing inspiration from a lot of real-world historical occult, alchemical, and scientific principles.
There are two Fullmetal Alchemist series. The 2003 series, simply called Fullmetal Alchemist, is noted to diverge from the original manga, but is still well-liked by audiences. In general the 2009 Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood follows the manga more closely and is generally held up as the better of the two.

 1  Inuyasha - Sunrise 
Based on the Manga Created By Rumiko Takahashi
        

  Year Released   200    Number of Episodes   167    Where to Stream it   Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Pluto TV    
One of prolific mangaka Rumiko Takahashi&#39;s numerous manga series, Inuyasha is a historical isekai series that largely predates the genre&#39;s explosion in popularity in the 2010s. Although the series tells the story of an epic quest for control of a powerful magical jewel that sees the protagonists fighting monsters and demons, Inuyasha is very much a romance story in the vein of Takahashi&#39;s other well-known works. Inuyasha is a masterful combination of epic adventure, flashy action, and brilliant character and monster design based around the core of a legitimately beautiful romance. Inuyasha has deservedly become one of the most important early 21st-century anime series. All of this adds up to making Inuyasha the best fantasy anime of all time.
Inuyasha&#39;s sequel series, Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon is currently streaming on a wide variety of services including Crunchyroll, Funimation, Prime Video, and Hulu.

While there is a certain archetype of fantasy works, the best creators are not necessarily beholden to the established archetypes. While some anime series fully embrace the traditions of archetypal fantasy, others satirize the genre for comedy. Other creators have decided to take fantasy in completely new and different directions. There isn&#39;t just one way to tell a fantasy story, and the most iconic anime creators recognize that fact. The limitless potential for creative new worlds and stories is masterfully demonstrated by the best fantasyanime of all time.
