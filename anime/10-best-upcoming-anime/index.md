## Literature Review

There are a number of upcoming anime that fans have been anticipating for quite some time, but these ten are the most exciting of that group.





Of course, there will always be anime coming on the immediate horizon to get people hyped. More seasonal shows like My Hero Academia have a fairly consistent release schedule, so fans can rely on always having seasons of that show to look forward to until it eventually ends. However, this list is focusing on the shows that have a bit more unpredictable release schedules, and likely won&#39;t come out for quite some time.









 








 10  Made in Abyss Season 3 
        

Made in Abyss is a twisted but beautiful fantasy anime following a young girl Riko and her robot companion Reg as they descend into the mysterious and dangerous Abyss in search of her mother. The second season was one of the best anime of 2022 and shortly after it aired a third season was announced. However, with few chapters of the manga to adapt, it is unclear when this season will be released.





 9  Hell&#39;s Paradise Season 2 
        

Hell&#39;s Paradise was an awesome and brutal action anime following a group of condemned criminals sent to a mystical island to find an elixir of immortality. The show is one part of Shonen manga&#39;s &#34;Dark Trio&#34; alongside Chainsaw Man and Jujutsu Kaisen, and the first season showed why as it pulled no punches with its action and twists. However, given Studio MAPPA&#39;s large workload and its likely prioritization of the next installments of Chainsaw Man, it will likely be a while before fans will get a continuation of Gabimaru&#39;s adventures.





 8  One-Punch Man Season 3 
        

After a long break between seasons, it seems that One-Punch Man Season 3 is currently being produced, although it is unknown which studio is doing it. The show still has an incredible amount of hype behind it despite its long time off the air and its relatively lackluster second season. Given the next arc of One-Punch Man&#39;s manga is widely regarded as one of the best in the series, the third season has a chance to fix the show&#39;s reputation and remind fans why the anime became so popular upon its release.





 7  Oshi no Ko Season 2 
        

When Oshi no Ko premiered in early 2023 it became a breakout success that took many anime fans by surprise. After all, an idol show with a reincarnation twist isn&#39;t normally what appeals to a wide audience. However, the incredible care that studio Doga Kobo put into the series along with a compelling hook at the end of the movie-length premiere made this anime a must-watch. With the next arc being a fan favorite, Oshi no Ko&#39;s second season may have the potential to surpass its first.





 6  Blue Lock Season 2 
        

Blue Lock shocked viewers when it defied expectations of everything a sports anime could be. The soccer competition at the show&#39;s center was more of a death game than a fun contest and made the show&#39;s matches even more intense. The characters also all got chances to shine as they each attempted to become Japan&#39;s top striker. Next season promises to feature even more intense gameplay and hype moments, which makes it one of the most exciting upcoming anime.





 5  Kaiju No. 8 
        

Kaiju No. 8 is one of the few nonsequel shows on this list, but based on the quality of its manga it is easy to see why this one made the cut. The manga by Naoya Matsumoto provides a lot of fun Kaiju battling action with a protagonist who is pretty unique from other Shonen heroes. With the powerhouse studio Production IG working on the project, the show is almost guaranteed to look gorgeous, and initial trailers have confirmed that suspicion. While this show may not be the deepest thing out there, it certainly will be an incredibly fun action show that will take the anime community by storm.





 4  Ranking of Kings Movie 
        

Ranking of Kings is one of the best fantasy anime out there. Gorgeously animated by WIT studio, it follows a young king named Bojji as he helps those around him. Fans of the show got a great reminder of what made the anime so great in The Treasure Chest of Courage, which was a season of side stories fleshing out the cast. However, this only progressed the plot of the show forward in the last episode which provided tantalizing hints of what&#39;s to come. A movie is apparently in production which promises to provide a much-needed continuation of this beautiful anime.





 3  Fate/strange Fake 
        

Fate has always been a convoluted franchise for potential fans to get into, but Fate/strange Fake promises to be a perfect jumping-on point as well as a great example of what makes Holy Grail Wars so compelling. The anime first premiered as a special that introduced its main cast of characters in glorious fashion, providing one of the Fate franchise&#39;s coolest fights and getting fans hyped up for future conflicts. A teaser for the follow-up to this special hinted at even more awesome characters and hype moments that will enthrall Fate fans both new and old.





 2  Demon Slayer Season 4 
        

Demon Slayer has consistently been one of the most exciting Shonen shows to be released in recent years. While some fans may grumble about a relatively basic Shonen story, studio Ufotable has brought the series to life with a level of detail that is mind-boggling. This makes every climactic fight in the series a major event and has caused the anime to become quintessential Shonen. The next season of the show, which is set to cover the Hashira Training Arc of the manga, promises to be no different which makes Demon Slayer easily one of the most anticipated upcoming anime.





 1  Chainsaw Man Season 2 
        

Chainsaw Man Season 1 was one of the most hyped anime of the year when it came out and it isn&#39;t hard to see why. With a fresh take on Shonen tropes, great action scenes, and beautiful animation, the show was one of the best anime of recent years. But as many manga readers are eager to share, the first season didn&#39;t even get to the arcs that make the Chainsaw Man manga so revered. Although Studio MAPPA has remained largely silent about the possibility of a continuation of the show, it is almost guaranteed to receive a second season or sequel movie. Until then, it is the best and most anticipated upcoming anime.
Many of these upcoming anime are still a long way out and thus fans have a grueling wait ahead of them. But given the quality of their existing episodes or trailers, these shows and movies are guaranteed to be worth the wait. While there is always the possibility of an unexpected breakout hit, for now, these are the best upcoming anime that fans know about.
