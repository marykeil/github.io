## Literature Review

Angemon&#39;s first appearance and decisive victory still stands as the absolute high point of the entire original Digimon series.

The heroes finally confront Devimon for the first arc&#39;s climactic battle in episode #13 of Digimon Adventure. The final battle goes poorly at first. Even the combined efforts of all of the Digimon heroes working together in their Champion-level Digivolutions are next to useless against the kaiju-sized Devimon, who finally turns his attention to T.K. and Patamon. For one awful moment, the heroes seem helpless and defeated, then Patamon, the little orange bat-guinea pig, finally Digivolves, unlocking his Champion-level form, the six-winged masked Angemon. Although still tiny compared to the sheer size of the colossal Devimon, Angemon shrugs off Devimon&#39;s attacks and draws back his flaming fist. With one punch, Angemon completely vaporizes Devimon.

This is the long-awaited culmination of Patamon&#39;s early character arc, revolving around Patamon&#39;s feelings of helplessness at being the last of the Digimon in the main cast to Digivolve. Although Angemon uses up so much of his own energy that he reverts to a Digi-Egg, he proves himself one of the most powerful Champion-level Digimon, wins the group a decisive victory over a previously unstoppable enemy, and creates an unforgettable moment that sounds out as the original series&#39; best.

This is Digimon&#39;s answer to Goku going Super Saiyan for the first time. Yes, other characters will unlock the same ability. Yes, new, more powerful forms â€” even Patamon&#39;s own later Digivolutions - would far surpass Angemon. Even so, this moment still stands out. This is the first time both the audience and the fans get to witness such a transformation, unlike anything in the series to that point. After unlocking their full potential, both Goku and Angemon deliver justice to the previously unstoppable bad guys in cathartic, much-deserved, and utterly one-sided ways. Goku shrugs off everything Frieza can throw at him. Angemon beats Devimon in a single punch, much like One-Punch Man&#39;s Saitama does.




          

Angemon&#39;s first appearance set the precedent for Patamon&#39;s later Digivolutions, appearing the least frequently but easily proving the most powerful and arriving at just the right time to save the day in decisive and memorable fashion. Although Angemon&#39;s first appearance happens only 13 episodes in the series, it is still the best and most memorable Digivolution. The first time a character as powerful as Angemon makes his impact felt is always the most memorable. Angemon&#39;s first appearance and one-punch victory over Devimon is the high point of the original Digimon anime, and one of the best moment in the franchise.

The original Digimon Adventure and the 2020 reboot are both available on Crunchyroll.
