## Literature Review

Lighthearted anime are just as cherished by fans as intellectually-challenging shows, and they are perfect for fans who want to relieve some pressure.




For many, the best low-stakes anime are a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of life. Not only are they outrageously silly, there are also plenty of shows in which nothing really happens besides a bunch of episodic hijinks with an iconic cast of characters. While a gripping plot and complex characters are always huge storytelling draws, it&#39;s occasionally nice not to have to think too much, especially after a long day of work or school.
Additionally, with the recent trend towards gritty action anime, seasoned fans may need a palate cleanser. As shows like Chainsaw Man or Demon Slayer continue to gain momentum, relaxing slice-of-life anime offer a great balance. Low-stakes anime may be less intense thematically, but they hold just as strong a place in the hearts of fans as intellectually-rigorous shows.









 








 11  Saezuru Doubutsu wa Yarushikanai! Reimagines Iconic Characters As Animals 
Anime by AQUA ARIS with characters by Kou Yoneda
        

Released in 2019 to promote the second film in the Twittering Birds Never Fly series, this mini anime reimagines its gritty yakuza cast as cats and dogs. At a mere 50 seconds per episode, it is immensely watchable, and cute enough to induce cavities. The Twittering Birds film series is dramatic and raunchy, so to say Saezuru does a 180Â° is a total understatement. It&#39;s also the perfect break in the action viewers may need between the two films. Newcomers unfamiliar with the film series can still enjoy this anime, but much of the fun lies in seeing how the main characters, Yashiro and Doumeki, embody their animal counterparts.





 10  Bananya Is Ridiculously Cute 
Anime by Studio Gathering with characters by Akiyo Nagano


 







Airing in 2016, Bananya follows a species of cat that quite literally lives inside a banana. Bananya, whose dream is to bathe in chocolate, banana-split style, lives with his fellow cat-bananas in a seemingly normal home. In addition to the adorably weird premise, the supporting cast is iconic. Long-Haired Bananya is ridiculously vain and brushes his hair for two hours each day, while Baby Bananya loves banana milk and is one of the more careless of the bunch. At just 3 minutes per episode, the series is prime for binge-watching.

 9  Ristorante Paradiso Places Middle-Aged Men Front And Center 
Anime by David Production, based on the manga by Natsume Ono
        

Many popular anime target the teen and young adult demographic, leaving middle-aged audiences out entirely. Thankfully, there are still series that feature an older cast of characters, including 2009&#39;s Ristorante Paradiso. Based on the manga by Natsume Ono, it details the main character, Nicoletta, stumbling upon an unusual restaurant in Rome, where the waiters are all older men who wear glasses. While this may sound like a classic reverse-harem setup, Paradiso takes it one step further, infusing each character&#39;s story with warmth and heart. A sweetly romantic series that is one of the best food anime of all time.

The titular character, Honda, is in charge of art books and foreign comics in his store. In other words, he works with a lot of manga, and often gets in mishaps while trying to help his foreign customers. In one hilarious sequence, a handsome English speaker attempts to buy a mature doujinshi for his daughter, and Honda&#39;s sheer panic during the incident is laugh-out-loud funny.

 6  Merman in My Tub Has A Whimsical Premise 
Anime by Asahi Production, based on the manga by Itokichi
        

High schooler Tatsumi lives by himself, and the last thing he expects is a gorgeous merman named Wakasa to make himself at home in his bathtub. Tatsumi and Wakasa are great narrative foils: Tatsumi is nosy but cool, while Wakasa is a classic anime pretty boy, self-absorbed and the source of much chaos. As Wakasa&#39;s aquatic friends start to stop by, Tatsumi&#39;s apartment quickly grows more crowded, making for a quirky and chaotic ensemble cast. Adding to the show&#39;s hilarity is the opening song, &#34;Fatal Wound&#34;, which is angsty and purposefully misleading. At 4 minutes per episode, Merman is another series that can be devoured in one evening.

Anime by Kyoto Animation, based on the manga by Keiichi Arai


 







Also known as My Ordinary Life, Nichijou chronicles the antics of childhood friends Mio, Yuuko, and Mai. With a robot caretaker, a talking cat, and an 8-year-old genius in the mix, there are plenty of instances where the girls&#39; adventures border on absurd. Though Nichijou was initially met with mixed reviews from Western audiences, it was praised years later for its surreal comedy and aesthetically-pleasing art style. The series&#39; episodic nature makes it one of the best anime to introduce kids to the medium, but there is still plenty for older audiences to enjoy.

 2  Sanrio Boys Tackles Shame And Toxic Masculinity 
Anime by Studio Pierrot, based on the manga by Mai Andou

Thankfully, he meets a group of boys at school from all walks of life, who are also interested in Sanrio characters. Though the show can feel more like a Sanrio ad at times, it is also a takedown of toxic masculinity and celebrates men showing their sensitive sides. A charming slice-of-life that is not to be missed.

Tatsu, the Immortal Dragon, was once a tough-as-nails yakuza, but left that life behind to become a stay-at-home husband.
