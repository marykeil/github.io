# The Real Reason Bakugo Bullied Deku in My Hero Academia is secretly Heartbreaking


## SUMMARY 



  Bakugo&#39;s apology to Deku in chapter 322 of My Hero Academia shows character growth and a realization of the importance of working together for the greater good.   Bakugo&#39;s bullying of Deku stemmed from his own feelings of inadequacy and the fear of being surpassed, not just pure enjoyment.   Despite their troubled past, Bakugo and Deku are now starting to improve their relationship and focus on their shared goal of becoming heroes.

## Literature Review

In chapter 322, Bakugou Katsuki reveals the real reason why he began bullying Deku so long ago when they were kids--and it&#39;s not what fans thought.




Many Deku fans haven&#39;t taken to Katsuki Bakugo&#39;s shift from bully to begrudging friend, but chapter 322 of My Hero Academia saw Bakugo actually apologize. Although an incredible turn of events, the stunning apology and confession make sense given the events of the manga at that point. Class 1-A had been desperately trying to rein in Deku as he rampaged alone across Japan, waiting to face All For One. Deku&#39;s classmates failed to get through to him, and just when the last-ditch effort of My Hero Academia&#39;s class 1-A had seemingly also failed, Bakugo tried reasoning with him.




For some time fans had understandably believed that, as children, Bakugo bullied young Izuku Midoriya mercilessly, because he was quirkless and yet still desired to be a hero, which was ostensibly impossible. In comparison, Bakugo not only possessed a quirk, but one that was especially powerful and flashy. Manga readers came to the conclusion that Bakugo just enjoyed bullying Deku because he was an easy target. Bakugo&#39;s anger and resentment towards Deku when he suddenly acquired All Might&#39;s incredible power and was even accepted into U.A. High made complete sense. Bakugo&#39;s confession, however, proves his feelings were much more complex than that.


 Bakugo Hated Deku Because He Felt Deku Surpassed Him 
          

Bakugo revealed the stunning truth in chapter 322, saying that, despite being miles ahead of Deku in turns of ability, he always felt as though he was actually trailing behind. Bakugo hated this feeling more than anything and wanted desperately to prove his strength to alleviate his fears, which explains why he was so merciless. Despite his best efforts, Bakugo still felt as though he lost every time, infuriating him further. Midoriya&#39;s acceptance to U.A. High had confirmed his fears, and only made him try harder. Bakugo then concludes his speech by apologizing.




Before, many fans felt that Bakugo&#39;s complete 180 with Deku was artificial because it transpired around the time he learned that All Might had chosen Deku to be his successor. Besides, how could Bakugo possibly make up for years of incessant bullying and mental abuse? His explanation, and even his apology, don&#39;t excuse his behavior. Acting out due to feelings of inadequacy might be more acceptable than doing so for the sake of enjoyment, as many originally thought was the case, but it still doesn&#39;t make what he did any less wrong, nor does it diminish or alleviate the abuse that Deku suffered. Regardless, Deku needed to hear the truth.



 Where Bakugo and Deku Stand Now 
          

After this pivotal scene, Bakugo and Deku&#39;s relationship dramatically improved. Bakugo makes an effort to refer to Deku by his real name, Izuku, although Deku says it&#39;s okay to continue calling him by Deku if the habit is too hard to break. Bakugo bravely battles alongside Deku in the final battle as well, even (seemingly) sacrificing his own life to protect Midoriya. With so much at stake, their personal past had to be set aside for the good of the world, and in the end, both boys have longed to be heroes for most of their lives. While Bakugo and Deku still have some work to do on their relationship, that can wait until after All for One is dealt with.




Bakugo and Deku&#39;s contentious relationship has been at the forefront of My Hero Academia since the very beginning, and Bakugo&#39;s ability to apologize was a major moment of character growth for him. It&#39;s not easy to own up to one&#39;s worst behavior, especially when it went on for as long as Bakugo&#39;s tormenting of Deku did. Still, Bakugo realized that Deku will be essential to the heroes&#39; ultimate victory, and that the greater good was worth more than his own ego. My Hero Academia has handled Bakugo&#39;s growth surprisingly well, and looking back, it&#39;s incredible how far he&#39;s actually come.
