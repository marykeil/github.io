# Big Anime Streaming Service Sizing Down Suggests Troubles For The Market


## SUMMARY 



  HIDIVE, a popular anime streaming service, will be shutting down in several parts of the world, leaving only their major market countries with access to their content.   This comes as a shock, considering HIDIVE was once seen as a potential competitor to Crunchyroll.   AMC Networks has released a statement expressing HIDIVE&#39;s desire to focus on its principal markets. HIDIVE&#39;s decision to limit its service could also be attributed to competition from larger streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix, and Disney&#43;.

## Literature Review

The hottest new platform in the anime industry has just shut down operations in several countries, raising the concerns of fans.






The author has reached out to HIDIVE&#39;s customer service, and their answer - reported in full here - has been used as the main source for this article.







Anime streaming service HIDIVE has just announced that it will be shutting down service in many parts of the world. As one of the bigger and newer anime streaming services, HIDIVE has been acquiring streaming rights for popular anime, making it a company to watch out for. After being bought by AMC Networks, the streaming site went on an aggressive campaign to become the go-to website for anime fans, and it was beginning to look like a real competitor for Crunchyroll.

HIDIVE managed to obtain exclusive streaming rights to popular anime such as Oshi No Ko and The Eminence In Shadow, which led to a surge in popularity and new subscribers. That&#39;s why it has come as a shock that starting on December 14, 2023, HIDIVE will only be available in select countries.

HIDIVE has been a rising platform in the anime industry that targeted niche anime to develop a steady foundation, and then went on to acquire licenses for bigger anime. For a while, it seemed that they could be Crunchyroll&#39;s new competitor, but this news completely shattered that notion.

 HIDIVE&#39;s Troubles Show The Harsh Reality Of The Anime Market 
A decrease in competition could lead to a monopoly and its risks.
          

There are a few reasons that could&#39;ve led to this decision by HIDIVE. The most sensible one would be the harsh competition they are facing from giants such as Crunchyroll and Hulu, and new entries in the anime scene such as Netflix and Disney&#43;, all of whom have incredible resources to negotiate bringing more anime to their platforms. A smaller player like HIDIVE wouldn&#39;t have as much leverage and not only would they be charged more by licensors, but they&#39;re also less likely to gain exclusive streaming rights as they are seen as risky due to their fewer subscribers.




Another major reason for the down-scaling of operations could be user feedback. Despite all this progress, users were complaining about issues with the interface, dubbing, subtitles, the mobile app, and, most worryingly, the sudden removal of anime from the site without prior notice. The lack of transparency has led to many users unsubscribing and subsequently deterring any potential users when voicing their frustrations. Many users have reported that the series would be removed even while they were watching, and when they contacted support, they were often redirected or given vague reasons for the occurrence.

          

After the news broke out, AMC Networks has addressed these concerns with an official statement:



“In light of the strong demand for anime content around the world, we are constantly evaluating the HIDIVE business and are strategically focusing our operations on the fast-growing global markets that represent approximately 98 percent of our current customer base. This move will unfortunately result in the disruption of service for some customers outside of our major markets. We are working directly with those customers to manage through this transition.”






From AMC&#39;s statement, it appears that they have chosen to focus on their main markets, to the detriment of customers in other countries. While the business decision is understandable, this news is a major blow to users outside the mentioned regions as the platform has always offered niche content, building a loyal user base. For reference, Crunchyroll is available worldwide, except for Russia, Ukraine Cuba, China, Iran, Japan, North Korea, Syria, South Sudan, and Sudan (but some content is regionally locked). Having fewer competitors has never been good for any market, as monopolies usually lead to increases in prices. Although a single platform having most anime is better from a viewer&#39;s perspective, the shrinking of the offer could also lead to increased piracy, which will hurt the creators. Now that HIDIVE operates in fewer countries, many fans worldwide will have to look for different outlets to stream their favorite anime.
