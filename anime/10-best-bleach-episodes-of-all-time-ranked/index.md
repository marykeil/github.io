## Literature Review

Bleach is a long-running series with hundreds of episodes to its name, and more on the way, but which episodes of Bleach are the best of the best?




Bleach is one of the most beloved and famous anime of all time, adapted from the legendary manga by Tite Kubo. And when it comes to Bleach, some episodes are of course more beloved than others, especially where filler is involved.
While the series has its share of filler, the best episodes of Bleach stand out as some of the most exciting shonen anime out there. With epic confrontations, unbelievable revelations, and tremendous power on display, these episodes of Bleach showcase everything fans love about the series. And now, with the new adaptation of its final arc, Thousand-Year Blood War, Bleach is adding new amazing episodes for the first time in almost 10 years. Here are 10 of Bleach’s best episodes, including what’s been seen of Thousand-Year Blood War so far.









 








 10  Bleach&#39;s Original Final Episode is An Epic Conclusion 
Original Series, Episode #366, &#34;Changing History, Unchanging Heart&#34;
        

The first run of Bleach&#39;s anime ended with its 366th and final episode, with the conclusion of the manga&#39;s penultimate arc. Ichigo, his Soul Reaper powers restored, battles it out with Ginjo, a rogue substitute Soul Reaper who held the position before Ichigo. It&#39;s Ichigo at his most powerful in the original series, and while the Fullbringer arc to which it belongs is often maligned by fans, the actual final episode itself is full of exciting moments, as well as a little emotion, with Ichigo committing to remaining a Soul Reaper while saying goodbye to Rukia.





 9  An Incredible New Bankai Debuts 
Thousand-Year Blood War, Episode #26, &#34;BLACK&#34;
        

Bleach returned with Thousand-Year Blood War to the cheers of many fans, hoping the anime adaptation would help fix some of the problems with the manga&#39;s final arc. The adaptation has been delivering in that regard, with the most major change being in the cour 2 finale. In this episode, Squad Zero confronts Yhwach and his elite guard, putting up a far more entertaining fight than they did in the manga. The episode ended with the incredible introduction of a never-before-seen Bankai, not from the manga, from Squad Zero&#39;s Senjumaru Shutara, showcasing the terrifying power that these top-tier Soul Reapers truly wield.





 8  Ichigo vs. Zaraki is One of Bleach&#39;s Most Entertaining Battles 
Original Series, Episode #39, &#34;The Immortal Man&#34;
        

A fan-favorite character in Bleach is that of Kenpachi Zaraki, the battle-obsessed, overpowered Captain of the 11th Squad, and his first battle with Ichigo helped to cement that popularity. The episode is split between a battle in Ichigo&#39;s inner world, where he attempts to win over his Zanpakuto, and the conclusion of his fight with Zaraki, which ends with a shocking loss for Ichigo. Zaraki&#39;s dramatic removal of his eyepatch signaled that Ichigo was out of his league, and but the renegade Soul Reaper managed to impress Zaraki, creating for himself a powerful ally in the future.





 7  A Glimpse into Bleach&#39;s Past Sets Up a Fantastic Battle 
Original Series, Episode #212, &#34;Rescue Hirako! Aizen vs. Urahara&#34;
        

The &#34;Turn Back the Pendulum&#34; arc is considered one of Bleach&#39;s best, and episode #212 represents the final episode in that story arc. The story goes back into the past and reveals Aizen&#39;s schemes, how they&#39;ve affected the Visored, and just how long his evil plan has been in motion. Another fan favorite character, Kisuke Urahara, plays a key role in this episode, helping to get the Visored stabilized and to safety in the World of the Living. It finally explains why Urahara, Yoruichi, and others are outcasts from the Soul Society, and fills in Aizen&#39;s backstory just in time for a confrontation.





 6  The Reveal of Bleach&#39;s True Villain Shocks Fans 
Original Series, Episode #61, &#34;Aizen Stands! Horrible Ambitions&#34;
        

Episode #61 is near the end of the Soul Society arc, but everything is about to be turned on its head. Sosuke Aizen, a Captain who was believed to have been murdered, reveals that he is in fact alive, and that Rukia&#39;s execution is all part of his plan, which has yet to be fully revealed. Both characters and fans were left stunned, and this realization that both Ichigo&#39;s group and the Soul Society were merely pawns for Aizen helps to bring the two groups together and stop fighting. It gives Ichigo a reason to get involved with stopping Aizen, and lays the foundation for Bleach&#39;s most popular arc.





 5  Ichigo&#39;s Battle with Grimmjow Put His Skills to the Test 
Original Series, Episode #166, &#34;Desperate Effort vs. Desperate Effort! The Hollowfied Ichigo&#34;


 







The Hueco Mundo saga is Bleach at its finest, and Ichigo vs. Grimmjow is one of the best fights within that saga. In an attempt to rescue Orihime Inoue, Ichigo has headed directly into the land of Hollows, Hueco Mundo, and comes face to face with a deadly opponent who has been looking forward to the challenge. Ichigo struggles not only to defeat Grimmjow, but also to keep control of himself, as his inner Hollow continues to fight for command. Ichigo&#39;s inner conflict heightens the battle with Grimmjow, raising the stakes so that fans can&#39;t be sure whether Ichigo will pull it out at the end.





 4  The Head Captain Proves He&#39;s Worthy of His Title 
Thousand-Year Blood War, Episode #6, &#34;The Fire&#34;
        

Episode 6 of Thousand-Year Blood War is set in the midst of the Quincy&#39;s first invasion of the Soul Society, and sees the Head Captain of the 13 Court Guard Squads (aka Gotei 13), Genryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, activating the full force of his Bankai for the first time in his fight against &#34;Yhwach.&#34; The episode is incredibly well animated, with gorgeous fire effects that make viewers really feel the sheer heat of Yamamoto&#39;s abilities. Yamamoto puts on an epic battle, but the episode takes a turn when &#34;Yhwach&#34; is revealed to not be Yhwach at all, ending with the shocking death of the Soul Society&#39;s strongest Soul Reaper, really driving home how dire the situation is.





 3  Ichigo vs. Byakuya Comes to a Dramatic Head 
Original Series, Episode #59, &#34;Conclusion of the Death Match! White Pride and Black Desire&#34;
        

Since his first appearance in the series, Byakuya was an intimidating figure who felt far beyond Ichigo&#39;s capacity to fight. Ichigo went through with his plan to rescue Rukia even knowing this, and trained incredibly hard to become capable of standing against Byakuya. The rematch was long awaited, and Ichigo was now packing a Bankai of his own, leading to an amazing battle with a real emotional core to it. Ichigo is so desperate to win that he loses control and momentarily allows his Hollow side to take over. It was a fight a long time in the making, and it was every bit as satisfying as fans hoped it would be.





 2  Ichigo Launches His Final Attack 
Original Series, Episode #309, &#34;Fierce Fighting Conclusion! Release, the Final Getsuga Tensho!&#34;


 







At the climax of the Arrancar storyline, Ichigo faces off with Aizen, now far more powerful than anyone could&#39;ve ever imagined. In order to defeat him, Ichigo will have to use the &#34;Final&#34; Getsuga Tensho, a move which will fully deplete his Soul Reaper powers. The attack itself is, of course, an incredible spectacle, but it also marks a major character moment for Ichigo, willing to sacrifice this new life he&#39;s found in order to save the day. After so long fighting Aizen, his defeat comes as a huge relief for fans, and finally signals the end of the long but beloved arc.





 1  Ichigo Vs. Ulquiorra is Bleach&#39;s Greatest Battle of All Time 
Original Series, Episode #271, &#34;Ichigo Dies! Orihime, the Cry of Sorrow!&#34;


 







Ulquiorra is another fan favorite character, despite being a villain, and so his long-awaited match with Ichigo was almost instantly one for the record books. The battle reaches its peak in this episode, and Ichigo&#39;s drive to win causes him to take on a crazy, inhuman transformation that brings him the closest he&#39;s ever been to becoming a Hollow. The episode is wall-to-wall action, and Ichigo&#39;s monstrous new form is enough to have fans questioning if he should really win like this, especially in front of Orihime. It&#39;s Bleach at its best: fantastic action that&#39;s emotionally anchored, well animated, and exciting all the way through.
