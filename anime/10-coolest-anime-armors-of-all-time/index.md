## Literature Review

Anime&#39;s most memorable suits of armor combine form and function, granting their wearers impressive powers and iconic visual designs.





Here, then, are the 10 suits of anime armor that tower above the rest - either because of their amazing designs, the way they have come to define their franchise, the amazing powers they imbue on their wearer, or all three combined.









 








 10  Goblin Slayer&#39;s Armor (Goblin Slayer) 
        

Associated with the character to the point that he is literally never seen without it, Goblin Slayer&#39;s armor gives the character his immediately recognizable visual profile. While Goblin Slayer&#39;s armor lacks any special powers, it&#39;s functional enough to hold up during his ceaseless battle against the goblins and other powerful monsters. It belongs here on the strength of its aesthetic - immediately recognizable as the very core of the franchise.





 9  Batman&#39;s Samurai Armor (Batman Ninja) 
        

Although Batman at one point does transform the Batcycle into a suit of powered armor to fight the movie&#39;s Sumo-wrestling version of Bane, the hero primarily goes through the DC Comics isekai film Batman Ninja in a standard suit of period-accurate Japanese armor. While lacking any special powers or functions, Batman&#39;s samurai armor certainly creates a striking visual, combining Batman&#39;s iconic costume with the design of a suit of Sengoku period armor.





 8  The Robe of the Fire Rat (Inuyasha) 
        

Fairly unassuming at a glance, the trademark red outfit from 2000s anime icon Inuyasha is in fact made from the fur of a magical fire rat. This supernatural origin makes it a powerful protection against fire and extreme heat specifically, as well as an incredibly durable piece of armor in general. In addition, the Robe of the Fire Rat has a healing effect on its wear. Inuyasha often uses the robe to protect Kagome from danger, complementing his already superhuman powers due to being a half-demon, This armor is cool because of the powers it possesses, but also gains points for looking totally unassuming while being wildly powerful.





 7  Saiyan Armor (Dragon Ball Z) 
        

The introduction of the Saiyans is still the most important thing to happen in the Dragon Ball franchise. Saiyans were the earliest enemies fought in Dragon Ball Z, and the revelation of Goku&#39;s Saiyan heritage would culminate in his attainment of Super Saiyan levels of power, one of the defining elements of the ongoing franchise. In addition to their relevance to the plot, the Saiyans also introduced a key visual component of the franchise: the iconic Saiyan armor.
Saiyan armor is durable but stretchy - essential to keep it intact when its wearer assumes their Great Ape form. Despite the Saiyans&#39; own power, the armor lends them much-needed protection, with Malaka crediting it with keeping Vegeta alive. In addition to Vegeta&#39;s armor being a key aspect of his design for years, later alien characters were also given armor clearly derived from the Saiyan design, and the armor has become so closely tied to the franchise that even the Earth-born Saiyan characters eventually got their own suits of Saiyan armor.





 6  The Hardsuits (Bubblegum Crisis) 
        

The four heroines of Bubblegum Crisis are a group of freelance mercenaries known as the Knight Sabers. Against the backdrop of a cyberpunk-influenced metropolis with a phenomenal 80s soundtrack, the Knight Sabers fight Terminator-like rogue cyborgs with an arsenal of high-tech weapons. The most significant pieces of equipment used by the Knight Sabers are their hardsuits; suits of powered armor which give them protection and increased strength, as well as an assortment of high-power weapons built right into the suits. These weapons include EMP explosives, arm-mounted blades, energy weapons housed in the palms, and even razor-sharp ribbons. The hardsuits are an entire arsenal, all while looking awesome.





 5  The Witchblade (Witchblade) 
        

Based on the American comic book of the same name, the Witchblade anime sees single mother Masane Amaha become the latest bearer of the titular weapon. When its ancient powers are activated, the Witchblade grants Masane magically empowered armor. While its default coverage is minimal, the Witchblade&#39;s armor reacts to violence, spreading to offer more and more protection as needed. The Witchblade armor can fend off blades, bullets, and explosives, and is constructed out of blades that can shred the attacker. With the Witchblade also providing healing, pyrokinesis, and enhanced strength and speed, wearing this armor effectively turns the wielder into a superhuman.





 4  The Cloths (Knights of the Zodiac: Saint Seiya) 
        

Most commonly known in English as Knights of the Zodiac, this long-running franchise centers on warriors whose magical armor connects them to the power of the Zodiac. The Saints&#39; magical armor is known as the Cloths and each Cloth bestows a unique power to its wearer, with the 12 strongest named for the Zodiac, and lower-ranking Saints named for other constellations. Given the sheer number of constellations represented by the large cast of Saints, Saint Seiya portrays a wide variety of special powers. Gold cloths can withstand a force equivalent to the Big Bang, while the highest rank - God Cloths - offer the power needed to kill minor gods and travel faster than the speed of light.





 3  Senketsu (Kill la Kill) 
        

Of all the weird ideas at play in Kill la Kill, a talking, transforming school uniform that&#39;s really an alien lifeform only manages to just crack the top ten. Both the plotlines and storytelling of Kill la Kill are completely off-the-rails. Even so, Senketsu is one of the most important characters in the series, serving as protagonist Ryoko&#39;s armor and providing her with substantially increased powers. The living armor also absorbs special fibers from the super-powered uniforms of Ryoko&#39;s enemies, making it ever stronger.
As the series progresses, Senketsu adopts new forms while in battle - some of which also transform Ryoko. The Senjin form sprouts claws and spikes, ShippÅ« offers flight through wings and jet thrusters, and Berserker Mode unlocks chaotic combat instincts.





 2  The Knight (Fairy Tail) 
        

Erza Scarlet is unanimously recognized as the strongest member of the Fairy Tail guild by the characters within the series, and a large part of that comes from her unique magic power, called the Knight. This magic allows Erza to summon magic suits of armor and change them at will as the need arises, complete with Sailor Moon-esque Magical Girl transformation sequence. One of the Knight&#39;s greatest strengths is sheer variety. Over the course of the series, Erza uses it to summon no fewer than 22 different types of armor. With armors that offer flight, elemental magic, light projection, energy beams, anti-magic, and vastly enhanced strength, the versatility of the Knight magic makes Erza&#39;s natural fighting prowess and determination all but unbeatable.





 1  Berserker Armor (Berserk) 
        

In addition to allowing Guts to surpass human limits and ignore pain, the full power of the Berserker Armor allows him to transform into a super-powered, beast-like form that has played a major role in numerous fight scenes through Berserk&#39;s run. While the work&#39;s title may suggest this was always intended, mangaka Kentaro Miura didn&#39;t initially intend any connection - the &#34;berserk&#34; title was more about the energy of the fictional world than the armor. The Berserker armor temporarily &#39;heals&#39; the wearer during battle, holding them together even if they suffer significant injuries, and enhances their bloodlust while transforming the sensation of pain - it&#39;s essentially a machine for keeping the wearer fighting as long and as hard as possible, with no thought for their own wellbeing. Perfectly suiting Berserk&#39;s larger themes, this armor is the most iconic in anime history.
While very different, the 10 iconic anime armors above are instantly recognizable and often provide the powers that make their wielders unbeatable - in the most extreme cases, all but transforming their wearers into living gods.
