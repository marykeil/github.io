## Literature Review

My Hero Academia&#39;s ultimate evil nearly tore All Might in half, but one protégé has proved he&#39;s more vital than Deku &amp; deserves what he&#39;s wanted most.




Warning: Spoilers For My Hero Academia Manga Chapter #405




All Might had previously given his powers to Deku to ultimately defeat My Hero Academia&#39;s overarching villain, All For One, but his final power-up has gone a fan-favorite character who exploded all expectations. The weakened mentor was foretold to meet a &#34;horrifying demise&#34; that fans have been dreading and expecting for years. Now, All Might has been saved, not by the quirkless student he entrusted One for All to, but by another protégé whose own skills have earned him the praise he&#39;s always wanted and the last gift All Might has in his arsenal.

MHA&#39;s former symbol of peace nearly experienced the brutal death foretold by Nighteye&#39;s Foresight Quirk in chapter #404, but Bakugo&#39;s epic save proved the prophecy false. And now, the student who kept up with Deku&#39;s outstanding growth with his own powers has earned something he&#39;s always desired: the admiration of his idol. 

          




Chapter #405 finally saw Bakugo rewarded for his outstanding talents and provided a heart-touching moment between the young hero and All Might. Author Kohei Horikoshi&#39;s expressive art style brilliantly captures the satisfaction of the young student as All Might gives Bakugo the last of his advanced armor to help defeat AFO.


 Bakugo Has Always Wanted What Deku Got, All Might&#39;s Support 
          

Although Bakugo was introduced as an intimidating bully to Deku, both his persona and relationship with MHA&#39;s main character grew into one of modern Shonen&#39;s most engaging rivalries. However, many layers of Bakugo&#39;s character came undone after his capture, leading to All Might using the last of his quirk&#39;s power to defeat AFO temporarily. The guilt he carried forced him and Deku to have a heart-to-heart, which proved how much Bakugo respected the man who inspired them both to want to become the number 1 hero. However, some could argue that he deserved All Might&#39;s attention more than Deku ever did.




Bakugo has constantly leveled up his abilities by finding intelligent ways to use his Explosion quirk to bolster his attack power and mobility. Much like the famous bond between Dragon Ball&#39;s Goku and Vegeta, Deku and Bakugo use each other&#39;s growth to push their powers to reach new heights. While Deku has fully mastered the power the One For All bestowed upon him, Katsuki Bakugo has risen to the heights of the series&#39; most skilled characters, even shocking All For One, the most feared villain in MHA&#39;s history. However, after saving All Might&#39;s life and being gifted the last part of his mentor&#39;s advanced support gear, Bakugo is gearing up to be the one who defeats AFO, not Deku.



 Bakugo Taking Down All For One Would Be His Best Conclusion 
          

With Deku using the combination of quirks he&#39;s mastered from OFA against Shigaraki, he has his hands full against All For One&#39;s pawn. Because of this, Bakugo is in the perfect position to fulfill the task that fans naturally assumed would fall to Deku by taking AFO down for good. If he can keep the series&#39; big villain from reaching Shigaraki long enough, AFO will continue to de-age until he is too young to fight. After years of hard work, Bakugo has proven to be genuinely worthy of being All Might&#39;s protégé. If he is the one to defeat All For One, the My Hero Academia world might consider Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight the world&#39;s greatest hero over Deku.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
