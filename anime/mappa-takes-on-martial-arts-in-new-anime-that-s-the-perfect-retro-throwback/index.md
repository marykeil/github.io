## Literature Review

Bucchigiri?! looks to be a madcap blend of the delinquent sub-genre and overblown martial arts that feels perfectly preserved from decades past.




MAPPA revealed its new upcoming original anime Bucchigiri?! - which will be streamed on Crunchyroll - with a new trailer that shows off its comedic martial arts premise. It joins several more shows that will be premiering next January. The footage shows a mixture of aesthetics and themes that seem better fit for decades past, showing that MAPPA&#39;s next anime seems to be a throwback to older martial arts stories.




Bucchigiri?! looks like it was perfectly preserved from the 90s or early 2000s. Its colorful cast of delinquents, the focus on elaborate hand-to-hand combat, and even its main protagonist seem to draw heavy inspiration from past works.


 

The only difference is that MAPPA is providing high-quality animation, perhaps to the consternation of anime audiences, considering the recent controversies surrounding the poor work conditions of MAPPA&#39;s animators.


 MAPPA&#39;s New Anime Offers Both Self-Aware Laughs And Exciting Fights 
         

The trailer, currently hosted on MAPPA&#39;s YouTube Channel, depicts the hapless Arajin Tomoshibi winding up in a school full of delinquents despite his desire for &#34;sweet high school days&#34;, which leads to him reuniting with his friend, gaining a crush, and somehow gaining the attention of the supernatural &#34;Majin&#34; Senya. The bright colors, exaggerated character designs, and Arajin&#39;s own bumbling foolishness show audiences that they shouldn&#39;t expect to take this anime&#39;s story too seriously. Really, it seems to be more of a vehicle to get tough guys swinging at each other, which is where the brunt of the effort lies.




Fighting delinquents are a bit of a rarity these days, but Buchigiri?! seems to be intentionally paying homage to older manga and anime, like Crows, which dominated the 90s with its own cast of punks. Even Arajin, who is aided by a supernatural force yet is unable to think of any goal grander than losing his virginity, echoes Ataru from Urusei Yatsura or other sex-obsessed comedy protagonists such as Eiikichi Onizuka. Even if it is just a parody, it is still surprisingly effective as a blast to the past. At the very least, fans of Tokyo Revengers will find familiar ground.

          

Despite the promise of the show, MAPPA&#39;s reputation has taken a hit recently amid allegations of staff being overworked, putting a shadow over their work. No matter how smooth and elaborate the fight scenes look, rather than evoking awe, viewers might sooner uneasily question what might have been sacrificed to acquire such quality animation. Nonetheless, the recent controversy about the studio hasn&#39;t stopped Crunchyroll from acquiring the new show for international broadcast, as reported by Anime News Network. When Bucchigiri?! arrives next year, fans should get ready to experience the 80s and 90s all over again, when musclebound students ruled the airwaves.
