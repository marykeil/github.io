<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The power scaling in Dragon Ball is notoriously always in flux, but as it stands in the current canon, these are the Top 15 strongest characters!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of increasingly powerful characters in the Dragon Ball continuity, so the title of the series&rsquo; strongest character often changes. The series gained a controversial reputation for a formulaic structure that would introduce a new level of strength with a frightening villain, only to have Goku defeat them. Thankfully, the series has grown beyond that trope, as it&rsquo;s no longer earthbound warlords or intergalactic conquerors the Z-Fighters are facing but literal gods and a surprising amount of characters stronger than Vegeta and even Goku.
Dragon Ball Super is the ongoing storyline of the Dragon Ball franchise written by Akira Toriyama and illustrated by Toyotarou. It has taken several characters from the original series and elevated them to new heights - not just Goku and Vegeta. Not only that, but Super has introduced fans to all-new characters, most of whom are so powerful that the familiar Saiyan warriors may never rival them.</p>
<p>The franchise is notorious for rapidly changing and/or fluctuating one’s power level depending on the story, making a concrete power-ranking almost impossible. Especially with the story being filled with temporary transformations that often seem to wear off when needed most. However, in the current state of Dragon Ball Super, it can be confidently asserted that these top 15 characters are Dragon Ball’s strongest.
The list will only include characters considered canon to the main Dragon Ball series, so it will not include characters from the movies, games, or Super Dragon Ball Heroes anime.</p>
<p>15 Majin Buu And Their Many Forms
Debut: Dragon Ball Manga Chapter #460, Dragon Ball Z Anime Episode #232</p>
<p>Majin Buu is a character the writers of Dragon Ball Super have had to write out of most conflicts due to their incredible abilities and potential strength. The plump Buu that&rsquo;s currently been living a comfortable life with Mr. Satan is far from the fearsome forms the final DBZ arc showcased. Buu reached ridiculous levels of power after absorbing his foes. Still, even after reverting to his Kid Buu form, the chaotic villain wiped out Earth and many of the universe&rsquo;s planets while casually hunting Goku and Vegeta, making Buu a fitting final villain for the DBZ series.
Orange Piccolo was bumped off the list because, despite now having strength comparable to Goku, he doesn&rsquo;t seem capable of the feats of destruction that Majin Buu displayed in Dragon Ball Z.</p>
<p>14 Vegeta, A Destroyer God In Training
Debut: Dragon Ball Z Manga Chapter #10, Anime Episode #5</p>
<p>Vegeta has broken the barrier of Super Saiyan numbering and even god ki transformations like Super Saiyan Blue, as he’s found a way to harness the very power of Destruction itself - just like a Destroyer God. The Ultra Ego transformation is a state of being where every hit he takes makes him stronger. He doesn’t have to channel ki to destroy things; Vegeta can simply will them to be destroyed with Hakai. However, Vegeta has not mastered Ultra Ego in the Dragon Ball Super manga and has a long way to go before rivaling other entries on this list.</p>
<p>13 Goku, A Mortal Who Has Earned The Respect Of Gods
Debut: Dragon Ball Manga Chapter #1, Anime Episode #1</p>
<p>Being one of the world&rsquo;s most popular characters, Goku needs little introduction. His accomplishments over the franchise&rsquo;s history include saving Earth on multiple occasions, often with the help of his allies and the techniques he&rsquo;s learned from several powerful masters. During the Saiyan&rsquo;s battles in DBZ, foes like Frieza and Cell have remarked how many of Goku&rsquo;s attacks are more than capable of destroying planets, and he&rsquo;s gotten a lot stronger during his training in DBS. So strong that his energy almost broke the fabric of the universe while battling Beerus, the God of Destruction.
Just as Vegeta has unlocked Ultra Ego by channeling Destroyer energy, so, too, has Goku unlocked power normally reserved for divine beings: Ultra Instinct. Ultra Instinct is an angelic state that allows one’s body to move autonomously, making the warrior wielding it nearly untouchable. Goku learned it from the Angel Whis, just as Lord Beerus helped Vegeta with Ultra Ego. However, Goku is far better with Ultra Instinct than Vegeta is with Ultra Ego. Though beyond that, the two are remarkably close in terms of power-scaling - perhaps the closest they’ve ever been.
To many fans&rsquo; delight, Vegeta defeated Goku in a training exercise during Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero that saw the two duel in their base forms to the point of exhaustion.</p>
<p>12 Gohan Could Be Stronger Then Anyone If He Put His Mind To It
Debut: Dragon Ball Z Manga Chapter #2, Anime Episode #1</p>
<p>Like Piccolo, Gohan got a significant upgrade in the film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero in the form of Beast Gohan. According to creator Akira Toriyama, Beast Gohan is stronger than Goku and Vegeta. After unlocking the new form in the Super Hero arc, Gohan easily tanked Cell Max&rsquo;s devastating punches that made short work of Orange Piccolo. Despite having little time to shine, Gohan has proven capable of incredible feats when his inner strength is unleashed throughout the franchise.</p>
<p>11 Broly, A Power That Even Destroyer God&rsquo;s Fear
Debut: Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #42, Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan Movie (1993)</p>
<p>While Goku and Vegeta explored alternate avenues of power beyond their Saiyan heritage, Broly quite literally surges with the power of his people. As the Legendary Super Saiyan, Broly has access to primal Saiyan power. Goku and Vegeta do not, and that power makes him practically unstoppable. Not even Super Saiyan Blue Goku and Vegeta were enough to beat Broly. It had to be Super Saiyan Blue Gogeta to finally take Broly down - as shown in Dragon Ball Super: Broly.
Broly is so powerful that Lord Beerus has been reluctant to let him train on his world for fear of the damage he&rsquo;d do. While later arcs of the Dragon Ball Super manga have seen the rehabilitated Saiyan training on the Destroyer&rsquo;s world with Goku and Vegeta, the fact that a literal Destroyer God is nervous around Broly is perhaps the most telling aspect of his strength.</p>
<p>New Dragon Ball Goku Vs. Broly Animation Bring the Manga to Life Like Never Before<br>
A new Dragon Ball Super fan animation features an epic battle between Goku and Broly and a shocking development for the Legendary Saiyan.</p>
<p>10 Jiren, The Pride of Universe 11
Debut: Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #30, Dragon Ball Super Anime Episode #85</p>
<p>The final hurdle that awaited Goku and his friends at the end of the Dragon Ball Super anime was the strongest warrior from Universe 11, Jiren the Grey. While the sequel series struggled to connect many of its arcs in meaningful ways to help set up compelling villains, Jiren was a character that met all the hype his character received during and even before the Tournament of Power began.
Very few fighters forced the strongest Pride Trooper to take them seriously, and even Ultra Instinct Goku failed to knock Jiren out of bounds. It took a lot of wearing down and the power of teamwork for Goku&rsquo;s team to finally triumph over Jiren, a foe the series failed to provide much backstory for. The source of Jiren&rsquo;s outrageous strength is also not clarified, but it&rsquo;s a strength that is rumored to be beyond some Gods of Destruction.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Super&rsquo;s Final Jiren Fight Broke a Decades-Old Tradition With One Subtle Twist<br>
The legendary final battle against Jiren in Dragon Ball Super surpassed many expectations, mainly because it did something other arcs rarely pull off.</p>
<p>9 Granolah, The Last Cerealian With A Powerful Wish
Debut: Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #67
With the help of many training arcs and the wisdom of incredible teachers, characters like Goku attained astonishing strength. The same can not be said for Granolah, who wished on a pair of Dragon Balls to be the universe&rsquo;s strongest warrior. While the wish ultimately came true, it came with a drastic downside: the revenge-hungry orphan&rsquo;s life span would be reduced to three more years.
Such a wish was made to avenge his Cerealian people from the Galactic Tyrant Frieza, but he&rsquo;d ultimately be manipulated to face off against Ultra Instinct Goku and Vegeta&rsquo;s newest destroyer form, Ultra Ego. With his new powers and special eyes that grant him incredible ki-sniping abilities, Granolah defeated Goku and Vegeta with their godly forms. He eventually became a valuable ally against another foe who&rsquo;d take advantage of Dragon Balls for an even bigger power boost.</p>
<p>8 Gas, The Heeter Family&rsquo;s Secret Weapon
Debut: Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #68</p>
<p>Gas served as the ultimate antagonist during Dragon Ball Super&rsquo;s Granola arc and proved strong enough to fight Saiyans like Goku&rsquo;s father, Bardock, from a very young age. Still, his already impressive level of power grew considerably after his own family wished with Dragon Balls that he&rsquo;d become stronger than Granolah. However, the improved power boost was given at the price of an even shorter life span for Gas.
The warrior&rsquo;s wide range of abilities includes the power to materialize seemingly any object or weapon Gas can think of, telekinesis, and unbelievable durability. Much like Broly, Gas seems to harbor some sort of primal rage power-up that he&rsquo;d struggled to control throughout his life. Even after being healed and reaching new levels of strength, Goku and Vegeta struggled against Gas&rsquo;s new power. By teaming up with Granolah, Gas was eventually defeated, but he was finally reduced to dust with a single blow from one of the franchise&rsquo;s best characters.</p>
<p>7 Frieza, The Galactic Tyrant Has Risen Again
Debut: Dragon Ball Manga Chapter #247, Dragon Ball Z Anime Episode #44</p>
<p>A relatively new transformation for the classic DBZ big-bad, Frieza debuted his ‘Black Frieza’ form in Dragon Ball Super chapter #87 and immediately proved his superiority. In this chapter, Black Frieza one-shotted both Goku and Vegeta when they were in the divine states of Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego. Respectively, not even Broly could pull something like that off. In fact, the whole reason Goku, Vegeta, and Broly are currently training on Beerus’ world is to get strong enough to challenge Black Frieza, and based on the events of this chapter, it’s uncertain if they will.
Frieza achieved this form by training in a time-displaced pocket dimension akin to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber for ten years. After arriving on the battlefield at the end of the Granolah arc, he destroyed a mangled Gas with a single blow, then surprisingly spared Goku and Vegeta. What Frieza hopes to achieve with his newfound power currently needs to be clarified. Unless the Saiyans train in a similar manner or find a new way to increase their strength, they may never surpass Black Frieza.</p>
<p>Frieza Can Kill Beerus - Dragon Ball Super&rsquo;s Next Arc Has a Big Opportunity It Shouldn&rsquo;t Pass<br>
After unlocking Black Frieza, the beloved Dragon Ball villain can shake up the Dragon Ball Super story by ending the God of Destruction Beerus.</p>
<p>6 Vegito, A Godly Gift That Fuses Two Into One
Debut: Dragon Ball Manga Chapter #504, Dragon Ball Z Episode #268</p>
<p>Fans got their first satisfying introduction to Goku and Vegeta&rsquo;s Potara Earrings fusion during Dragon Ball Z&rsquo;s Buu Arc. Buu had absorbed Gohan and Gotenks, and all seemed lost until fans&rsquo; dreams came true in a fusion of fan-favorite characters, Goku and Vegeta. Once Vegito appeared, the unstoppable Super Buu was quickly proven to be out of his league. The powerful fusion would return in Dragon Ball Super when it was required to take down an evil god.
Potara Earring&rsquo;s create a permanent fusion if used by two Kais. However, if two mortals use the earrings, the transformation becomes limited based on the amount of power that is used.</p>
<p>While the transformation is active, the fused warrior has been nearly untouchable, even against overwhelming foes like Super Buu and the Fused Zamasu. The two fused warriors&rsquo; strength is combined, making Vegito easily one of the franchise&rsquo;s strongest characters; it&rsquo;s a fusion that can not be achieved unless a pair of the Kai&rsquo;s Potara Earrings are available. Plus, both times Goku and Vegeta have used the Potara earrings, it has failed to last long enough to defeat their opponents definitively.</p>
<p>5 Gogeta, A Very Temporary But Very Powerful Fusion
Debut: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn Movie (1995)</p>
<p>Shonen Jump, the publisher of the Dragon Ball manga, officially settled the debate long ago that Gogeta would beat Vegito. However, both fighters&rsquo; power levels are so similar that the Vegito could still find a way to win. Due to Vegeta&rsquo;s pride, he and Goku have not resorted to using the Fusion dance lightly. The epic form first debuted against a demon comprised of the universe&rsquo;s evil energy. Dragon Ball Super debuted the fusion and its SS Blue form against Broly&rsquo;s primal rampage. Once Gogeta transformed into his godly blue form, he was utterly untouchable and overwhelming.</p>
<p>4 Lord Beerus, The Multiverse&rsquo;s Strongest God of Destruction
Debut: Dragon Ball Z: Battle Of Gods Movie (2013), Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #1</p>
<p>While the mortals that have taken up the prior entries on this list are impressive in their rapid elevation of extreme power, they still can’t defeat the might of the strongest God of Destruction himself, Lord Beerus. In Dragon Ball Super chapter #28, Lord Beerus is forced to battle every other God of Destruction from across the Dragon Ball multiverse and comes out on top - but that’s not all. Lord Beerus is the master of Destruction - or Hakai - and can will things out of existence by simply raising his hand.
Throughout Dragon Ball Super, Beerus has been training Goku and Vegeta for a very good reason. He has been a Destroyer God for millions of years and wants someone else to get stronger than him so he can retire. Vegeta is slowly learning to use Hakai, but no mortal has been able to match the full might of a Destroyer who can simply decide to erase one from existence - and Beerus is the toughest Destroyer of them all.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball&rsquo;s Beerus Has a Secret Weakness That Proves How Goku &amp; Vegeta Could Kill Him<br>
Beerus maybe Dragon Ball Super&rsquo;s Ultimate God of Destruction, but they can die thanks to one glaring weakness that Goku or Vegeta would never exploit.</p>
<p>3 Whis And His Divine Angel Siblings
Debut: Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods Movie, Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #1</p>
<p>Whis is an angel who’s charged with not only guiding Lord Beerus in his cosmic purpose to maintain order in the universe through destruction but also training him. In a way, Whis is Lord Beerus’ martial arts master, who’s teaching the God of Destruction the ways of Ultra Instinct (something Beerus still hasn’t mastered). Beerus cannot touch Whis, while Whis can inflict any level of punishment he wants on Beerus if the two were ever in a serious bout. However, that’s not something an angel would ever engage in and is purely hypothetical.
Angels are seemingly eternal while Dragon Ball Super&rsquo;s Gods of Destruction are not (with the Tournament of Power proving that terrifyingly accurate), implying angels are simply of a higher plane of existence, justifying Whis&rsquo; position as one of Dragon Ball&rsquo;s strongest characters. Whis and his siblings are seemingly in a consistent state of Ultra Instinct, and it&rsquo;s unlikely fans will ever get to see Whis&rsquo;s full range of power and capabilities put on display. Still, Whis has admitted that even his strength pales in comparison to that of another angel.</p>
<p>2 Grand Priest, Father Of The Angels and Grand Vizier of the Multiverse
Debut: Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #17, Dragon Ball Super Anime Episode #55</p>
<p>If Whis is above Lord Beerus, then it only makes sense that the Grand Priest is above Whis, as he is the father of all angels and the right-hand person of the Omni-King (King of All) himself. Grand Priest enforces the divine decrees of the Omni-King(s) and is the one who assigns angels to their Gods of Destruction. It could be argued that Grand Priest is the true mastermind behind how the entire multiverse functions in Dragon Ball canon. It’s implied that he can deliver personal and harsh punishments to any who dare challenge him or the Zenos.
The Grand Priest is shown to be so intimidating that he silences Beerus with a short glare. Whis even pressured Goku not to challenge his father to a sparing match, likely fearing what such a display of power would do to Goku or maybe even the fabric of reality, which weaker warriors on the list have damaged. Like with Whis, Grand Priest isn’t aggressive in the slightest. In fact, he’s too powerful to be. At this point, characters start to enter a state of power so incomprehensible that fighting isn’t even necessary.</p>
<p>1 Grand Zeno aka The Omni-King, The King Of All The Multiverse
Debut: Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter #13, Dragon Ball Super Anime Episode #40</p>
<p>Indeed, the perfect example of a being (or beings) so strong that they don’t have to fight is the Omni-King. Grand Zeno is Dragon Ball&rsquo;s most powerful being. He&rsquo;s the ruler of the cosmos, and someone who can eliminate an entire universe with a mere thought, a horrifying feat that was shown multiple times over during the Tournament of Power.
Dragon Ball Super’s Future Trunks Saga showed the Omni-King wipe out the universe in which Zamasu had taken over. At that point, Goku invited that version of Zeno (known as Future Zeno) back to his original universe, where Future Zeno could rule alongside his alternate self. While the idea of two Zenos ruling the cosmos may seem terrifying, it’s no more so than if just one was sitting on the throne, as the Omni-King is the pinnacle of what true power is in the Dragon Ball universe.
