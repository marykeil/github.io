# Pokémon Ashs Best Pokémon From Each Region


## SUMMARY 


 Pikachu&#39;s refusal to evolve into Raichu hindering its battling prowess is a limitation to its strength, but it has proven its power numerous times. 
 Charizard is one of Ash&#39;s most popular and memorable Pokémon, despite their initial disobedience and defiance, their bond grew stronger over the years. 
 Greninja, with its unique form, Ash-Greninja, is one of Ash&#39;s most powerful Pokémon and has a close bond with him, although Ash&#39;s decision to release it remains controversial.

## Literature Review

Ash Ketchum unsurprisingly has some of the best Pokémon in the world, but what are his best Pokémon from each region?




Ash Ketchum was the protagonist of the Pokémon anime for 1,232 episodes, during which he traveled far and wide across the Pokémon world. He visited 8 of the Pokémon world&#39;s major regions, during which time he caught 78 Pokémon, including his 30 Tauros. The Pokémon he caught in each region differ greatly, and for each land he visited, Ash built a completely new team. With all these Pokémon teams to his name, though, just which of Ash&#39;s Pokémon is his very best from each region?
Out of all of Ash&#39;s Pokémon, some are certainly more memorable than others. When it comes to the best, Charizard and Greninja are both strong candidates. Still, the matter is too subjective to declare that one Pokémon is better than all others. However, with each new region that Ash visits, some Pokémon immediately stand out, becoming crucial members of his team, and earning a place among his most valued allies. Now that Ash&#39;s journey has come to an end, which Pokémon stand out most for each region he visited?









 








 9  Honorable Mention: Pikachu 
        

Pikachu is not only Ash&#39;s best friend and closest companion but also one of his most powerful Pokémon. Pikachu&#39;s journey is uneven, and he goes through numerous changes throughout the anime. Starting in Black &amp; White, he somewhat regresses into a weaker state with little explanation. However, in the most recent seasons, Pikachu is once again an impressive and formidable Pokémon.
Still, there are limitations to its strength, and Pikachu&#39;s refusal to evolve into Raichu arguably hinders its battling prowess. Pikachu is the one constant on Ash&#39;s teams, and Pikachu has proven just how powerful it is numerous times, like in the Lily of the Valley conference when it faced off against Tobias&#39; Latios, or in Ash&#39;s final match versus Leon in the Masters&#39; Eight tournament.





 8  Kanto: Charizard 
        

Arguably Ash&#39;s most popular Pokémon other than Pikachu, Charizard&#39;s journey with his trainer is one for the ages. It first appears as an abandoned Charmander, starting a trend about Ash&#39;s Fire starters getting discarded by other trainers. It then evolves into a spirited Charmeleon before reaching its final stage. As Charizard, the Pokémon initially refused to obey Ash and, at times, even actively defied him. Over the years, they became closer, and Charizard returned to aid Ash even after their parting in &#34;Charizard&#39;s Burning Ambitions.&#34; Charizard famously fought an Entei in the third Pokémon movie, although it was part of an illusion conjured by the Unown.
Ash and Charizard parted ways when he left Charizard in the Charicific Valley, a canyon where many Charizard live, to train and grow stronger. Ash eventually reunited with Charizard, and Charizard resides at Professor Oak&#39;s Lab as of the end of the series.





 7  Johto: Heracross 
        

Heracross was the first Pokémon Ash caught in Johto. The dual Bug/Fighting-type soon became one of his main Pokémon, and Ash used it in the Lily of the Valley conference against Tobias&#39; Darkrai, where it performed quite decently, even though it couldn&#39;t prevail. Ash also used it during his climactic battle with Gary Oak in the Silver Conference. Heracross defeated Gary&#39;s Magmar before succumbing to his Blastoise.
Heracross is eager to battle, yet easily distracted. Its love for sap is a running gag in the series, and it often sucks it out of Bulbasaur&#39;s bulb, much to the Seed Pokémon&#39;s annoyance. Heracross rejoined Ash&#39;s team for the final time in &#34;Ride, Lapras, Ride!&#34;, where it helped to free a trapped Wailmer. Heracross, like Charizard, is shown to reside at Professor Oak&#39;s Lab at the end of the series.





 6  Hoenn: Sceptile 
        

Sceptile isn&#39;t the first Grass starter that Ash owns, but it&#39;s easily the most powerful one. After all, his Bulbasaur never evolved, and his Chikorita only made it to Bayleef. Thus, Sceptile is the second fully-evolved starter that Ash owned after Charizard. As one of Ash&#39;s most suave Pokémon, Sceptile always acted calm and collected, even as a Treecko. It is very proud and stubborn, qualities that make it even more dauntless in battle. Sceptile memorably defeated Tobias&#39; Darkrai, cementing its place as one of Ash&#39;s most impressive Pokémon.
Sceptile was valuable for training Ash&#39;s Sirfetch&#39;d before they entered the Masters&#39; Eight tournament, and rejoined Ash&#39;s team for the final time in &#34;The Road Most Traveled!&#34;, where it helped to defend an injured Latias. Like Charizard and Heracross, Sceptile is last shown to be at Professor Oak&#39;s Lab, with many of Ash&#39;s other Pokémon.





 5  Sinnoh: Infernape 
        

Like Charmander, Chimchar got abandoned by its former trainer, Paul. Hurt yet inspired, it joined Ash on a journey that would eventually turn him into the trainer&#39;s strongest Sinnoh Pokémon. Chimchar is one of the most expressive Pokémon in the anime and cried more than once during its early days with Ash. As Infernape, and whenever it used Blaze, it went berserk and lost all control. It even hurt Ash, and it took the trainer much work to get the fire monkey to calm down. Infernape also shares a similar personality with its trainer, as both it and Ash are always looking for trainers stronger than themselves.
In Journeys, Infernape had a spotlight episode, &#34;Advice to Goh,&#34; where it wanted to challenge a Moltres to battle. While Infernape was ultimately no match for the Legendary Pokémon, it gave fans a little more time with this fan-favorite Pokémon. Infernape joined Ash&#39;s team a final time in &#34;Rocket Revengers!&#34;, where it helped defend Pikachu against Team Rocket&#39;s massive attack using all their previous Pokémon. As with most of Ash&#39;s other signature Pokémon, Infernape is last seen living at Professor Oak&#39;s Lab, alongside many of Ash&#39;s other Pokémon.





 4  Unova: Pignite 
        

Ash&#39;s Unova team isn&#39;t the most memorable. Even though he catches all the starters, only one evolves, but it never reached its final form. Like Chimchar and Charizard before it, Tepig&#39;s former trainer also forfeitted it. It willingly went with Ash after he showed kindness towards it, but remained unsure of itself. It evolved into Pignite during a battle against its former owner, Seamus, upon which its self-esteem improved, even becoming somewhat vain. Pignite also shares a deep admiration for Ash&#39;s Charizard, and a friendly rivalry with his Infernape. Pignite never rejoined Ash&#39;s team and currently resides at Professor Oak&#39;s Lab, where it lives alongside Ash&#39;s other Fire-type Pokémon.





 3  Kalos: Greninja 
        

Unlike Unova, Ash has plenty of iconic Pokémon in Kalos. Goodra, Noivern, and Talonflame are all exceptional, but it&#39;s Greninja who ultimately comes out on top. Although its personality doesn&#39;t show it, Greninja is one of Ash&#39;s most powerful Pokémon ever and has a very close bond with him. This bond ultimately allowed it to acquire a unique form, known as Ash-Greninja. It takes some time for both the trainer and Pokémon to master the form, because Ash also feels physical pain whenever Greninja takes damage.
Ash&#39;s decision to release Greninja in &#34;Facing the Needs of the Many!&#34; remains controversial in the community, but the Pokémon&#39;s spirit lives on in the hearts of fans. Greninja reappeared in the Journeys episode &#34;Catching the Aura of Fate!&#34;, where it helped train Ash&#39;s Lucario in how to use its Aura abilities. As of the end of the series, Greninja resides in the Kalos region, where it works to defeat evil roots that threaten the region&#39;s safety.





 2  Alola: Melmetal 
        

Because it debuted in Pokémon GO, Melmetal and its pre-evolution, Meltan, aren&#39;t particularly well-known by most players. The Pokémon anime, which often contradicts the games, has plenty of Meltan living in the wild, one of which eventually joins Ash&#39;s team. It evolves into Melmetal after fusing with the group of wild Meltan, increasing its power considerably. A curious and independent Pokémon, Melmetal constantly wandered off, much to Ash&#39;s chagrin. It also tended to act on its own, even during battle.
Melmetal is the first and only Mythical Pokémon to be owned by Ash. After Ash left the Alola region, he left many of his Pokémon, including Melmetal, behind with Professor Kukui, so that the Professor might study the rare Pokémon further. While Melmetal did get to see Ash again a few times, it never rejoined his team and remains with Professor Kukui.





 1  Galar: Dracovish 
        

Dracovish is a very bizarre Pokémon. It is, of course, the combination of two wrong fossils, but its personality is as strange as its appearance. Like James&#39; Victreebel, Dracovish also enjoys biting Ash&#39;s head as a sign of affection. Despite its caring and kind nature, Dracovish is a very resilient and powerful Pokémon. It defeated Iris&#39;s powerful Dragonite, cementing its place as Ash&#39;s Galarian ace. Dracovish also came in clutch during the Masters&#39; Eight tournament, where it battled against Leon&#39;s Dragapult and manifested a strange new ability that helped it (and Ash) to win.
After being named the World Champion, Ash left Dracovish and the rest of his Journeys team at Professor Oak&#39;s Lab, intending to cycle through his many Pokémon on future adventures. As such, Dracovish is left living at the Lab as of the series&#39; end.
While Ash has a strong bond with many of his Pokémon, the Pokémon listed above proved to be some of his most reliable allies on his journey. Most of these Pokémon were not only willing, but excited to evolve and grow stronger, and their enthusiasm for battle mirrored Ash&#39;s. With such complementary personalities, it&#39;s no wonder that these Pokémon stand out as those closest to Ash and those most valuable in battle. Ash&#39;s journey may have come to an end, but the relationships he built throughout the Pokémon anime serve as a testament to the qualities that helped eventually make Ash a World Champion.
