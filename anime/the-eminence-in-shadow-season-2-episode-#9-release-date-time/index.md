## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #9 will feature the return of its hilarious hero Cid and likely show off more of the series&#39; world.




After a brief filler detour, The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #9 should introduce the plot of the next main story arc. This should also allow the series to put its chaotically great hero Cid back into the spotlight. This will be a welcome return given his notable absence in the last episode.





 What Time The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #9 Releases 
          

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #9 will be airing in Japan at 10:30 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Wednesday, November 29. It will be simulcast on HIDIVE on November 29 at 11:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12:30 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). The Eminence in Shadow fans in the UK will be able to watch the episode at 19:30 British Summer Time (BST). The English dub will be available to watch on HIDIVE at the same time as the subbed version, just like with The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s Season 2 premiere.



 What Happened In The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #8? 
          




Episode #8 was a filler episode, serving as its own mini-arc focusing on the Seven Shades. After Skel and Po steal some hot spring tickets from Cid&#39;s room, the Seven Shades view it as a code from Shadow that they must go on a date with them. This led to hilarious antics between characters that rarely interact, as well as showing off characters like Eta and Zeta, who have barely appeared in the anime thus far. It also gave the Seven Shades some much-needed relaxation time, even if they had to fight a water dragon before the episode&#39;s end.



The episode also featured cameos from other characters introduced this season.






 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #9 Will Feature Cid Again 
          




While the brief diversion into the hot springs was fun, the show&#39;s central focus is on Cid&#39;s adventures, so episode #9 is almost guaranteed to reintroduce him into the story. It is unclear where Cid went after the events of episode #7, but given he felt the need to avoid Shadow Garden for a bit and he wasn&#39;t in town for episode #8, he is likely traveling to a new location. There are still a lot of important regions of the world that fans have yet to see, so this arc could be a great exploration of one of those areas. This could also involve Cid in the politics of another kingdom, which could be fun to watch.

No matter what the exact plot of episode #9 is and where it takes place, as long as it mainly focuses on Cid&#39;s antics it should be a fun watch. Cid is a major reason why The Eminence in Shadow is one of the best isekai in all of anime so the series shouldn&#39;t ignore him for too long. Luckily, it appears that The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #9 will return the anime to its typical fun formula.




Don&#39;t miss The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #9 when it airs on HIDIVE on November 29, 2023.
