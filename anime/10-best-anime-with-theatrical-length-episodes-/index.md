## Literature Review

On rare occasions, anime have been known to open with theatrical-length episodes at least an hour long, and here are the 10 that are among the best.





An anime that opens with a theatrical-length episode is usually one that’s more than worth watching, and here are 10 that stand out as among the best. It should be noted that many of the anime listed here will have their premieres technically run for a little less than an hour, as the extra time will come from either commercials when they aired in Japan or advertisements that may run on certain streaming services. Regardless, each of the anime listed here opens with an episode far longer than their contemporaries, and the rest of the episodes to follow are of similar high quality.









 








 10  Astra Lost In Space 
        

Astra Lost in Space used its hour-long premiere to fully immerse the audience in its sci-fi adventure story and the ragtag group of characters who were caught up in it, and at the end of it all was an episode that set up its story with a perfect amount of pacing and characterization for its cast. The rest of Astra Lost in Space did a great job of following that, and the overall quality of the series can be seen thanks in large part to having such a lengthy premiere.





 9  The Rising Of The Shield Hero 
        

Another anime that used its lengthy premiere to tremendous effect was The Rising of the Shield Hero. Most of the runtime of Shield Hero’s series premiere is spent setting up as a typical isekai series, only for the last portion of the episode to flip things around and show that it’s actually a far darker story than what most people were probably expecting. That wouldn’t have worked nearly as effectively had the anime not spent so much extra time on its premiere, and because it did, it set the anime off to a great start.
            
 
 &#34;A Return To Form&#34;: Rising of the Shield Hero Season 3 Fixes Season 2&#39;s Disappointment 
The Rising of the Shield Hero season 2 was met with largely negative reception, but season 3 episode #1 appears to be putting things back on track.








 8  Re:Zero - Starting Life In Another World 
        

In a similar vein to The Rising of the Shield Hero, Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World also used its lengthy premiere for the sake of subversion. Re:Zero also spent a lot of its premiere selling itself as a typical isekai anime, albeit with some darker elements courtesy of Subaru’s Return by Death ability, but it soon becomes clear that the theatrical length was also to establish how much it would be deconstructing the conventions of the genre. A large part of Re:Zero’s appeal stems from how different it is from other isekai anime, and its lengthy premiere was the perfect way to set that up.





 7  Fate/Zero 
        

Ufotable is famous for its continued work on the Fate franchise, and one of the best showings of its work comes from the theatrical-length premiere of Fate/Zero. While the premiere was largely just exposition to set up the basic premise of the anime, not only did the extra length allow for it all to be given with proper pacing, but Ufotable’s signature direction and cinematography conveyed it without ever feeling dull. Fate/Zero was the first Fate anime to be made with production values befitting the source material, and its premiere was the perfect way to kick that off.





 6  Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 
        

Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works was the next Fate anime to follow Fate/Zero, and it also opened with a theatrical-length premiere. In addition to adapting the prologue of the original visual novel, Unlimited Blade Works also took the time to add an original flair to the story with its art direction and small additions to the source material, and it helped make its premiere one that more than earned its length. The next episode used its similarly lengthy runtime to do much of the same work, and it all led to the series becoming a clear step above the original Fate/stay night anime.





 5  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba 
        

Another Ufotable series that’s opened with theatrical-length episodes is Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Both season 2 and season 3 of Demon Slayer opened with theatrical-length episodes that greatly adapted the manga with the beautiful art, music, and overall direction that have become staples of the franchise, and season 3’s premiere did it to such an extent that it even had a theatrical release. The extra length of each season premiere allowed for Demon Slayer’s strengths to come out in full force, and with any luck, season 4 will be no different in that regard.
            
 
 Demon Slayer Season 3 is the Rare Anime That Improves On the Manga 
In its third season, Demon Slayer tops fans&#39; and critics’ expectations and solves an age-old curse haunting nearly every manga-based anime.








 4  Sword Art Online: Alicization 
        

Sword Art Online, for better or worse, is one of the biggest anime franchises of the past decade, and that’s best shown with the theatrical-length premiere of Sword Art Online: Alicization. Alicization told a story that was completely different from what the franchise was known for at that point, and with its lengthy premiere, it was able to perfectly convey to the audience the setting and the stakes surrounding it. Sword Art Online: Alicization was also the first new season of the anime after four years, and its lengthy premiere did a great job of showing that the anime hadn’t missed a step.





 3  Ragna Crimson 
        

Ragna Crimson has only just started airing at the time of writing, but its theatrical-length premiere already makes it worth mentioning. In its extra-long premiere, Ragna Crimson did an excellent job of developing not only the premise of its story, but the tragedy of Ragna’s character and what he puts himself through to overcome it. Every minute of its theatrical-length premiere highlighted the strengths of its story with incredible direction, and with any luck, the rest of the series will follow.





 2  Oshi No Ko 
        

Another recent anime with a theatrical-length premiere, and one of the most famous examples in recent years, is Oshi no Ko. Oshi no Ko drew a lot of attention when it was announced to have a ninety-minute premiere, with said episode even premiering in theaters in Japan, and sure enough, it told a story that was as beautiful to look at as it was tragic, and it more than deserved every minute of its runtime. The attention garnered by the premiere led to Oshi no Ko becoming one of the biggest anime of 2023, and it’ll be a wonder to see how Oshi no Ko season 2 tops it.





 1  Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End 
        

Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End is another really recent example of an anime with a theatrical-length premiere, but it more than deserves mentioning. Frieren beat Oshi no Ko with an incredible two-hour series premiere, and not a single minute of that was wasted, as it was used to perfectly convey the solemn nature of its story, the characters who take part in it, and everything they hope to do about it. The lengthy premiere did a great job of living up to the stellar reputation of the original manga, and it will be great to see how the rest of the series follows it.
Overall, it’s clear that an anime having a theatrical-length premiere is nothing but a boon to its quality. Every anime listed here used their lengthy premieres to give themselves incredible openings that were followed by episodes of equally high quality, and thanks to that, they’ve all managed to stand out and leave their mark in one way or another. Not every anime needs to open with a theatrical-length episode, but as seen here, any anime that does is certainly going to be worth watching.
