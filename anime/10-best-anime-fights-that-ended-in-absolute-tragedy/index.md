## Literature Review

Anime is a medium that&#39;s filled to the brim with fights, and some of them stand out specifically for how tragic their conclusions are.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2Anime fights are a major staple of the medium, and sure enough, it’s all too common for them to end in tragedy. Sometimes, it’s a result of the hero losing and dying, but there are other times when the tragedy comes from how victory forces the heroes into a situation that only makes them feel worse at the end.
There are plenty of fights in anime that end in tragedy, and there are a few among them that stand out as the best. Some do for the stellar direction used to animate them, thus allowing for the tragic stories being told to be conveyed in as high a quality as possible. Other fights stand out for the tragic stories behind them, as they’re all the culmination of a multitude of events, both good and bad, that end in a way that often leaves no one feeling satisfied, regardless of how necessary the fight might have been.









 








 10  Saber Vs. Lancer 
Fate/Zero
        

  Episode   #16    Release Date   April 21, 2012    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll    
The first great anime fight to end in tragedy is Saber vs. Lancer in Fate/Zero. Throughout the series, Saber and Lancer maintain something of a friendly rivalry built upon being two of the only Servants who care about honor, but that is ruined when Kiritsugu forces Kayneth to use a Command Seal to make Lancer kill himself. That act broke Lancer to the point that he cursed everyone present with his final breath, and not only did Saber lose what little trust she had in Kiritsugu, but she was once again forced to confront the shortcomings of her ideology, thus leaving no reason to be happy with her victory.





 9  Domon Vs. Master Asia 
Mobile Fighter G Gundam
        

  Episode   #45    Release Date   March 3, 1995    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll    
Another great fight that ends in tragedy despite the hero’s victory is Domon vs. Master Asia in Mobile Fighter G Gundam. There was always an element of tragedy to Domon and Master Asia’s conflict, but their final fight added even more to it by revealing that Master Asia was trying to use the Dark Gundam to save the Earth the entire time. The revelation that Master Asia hadn’t become a monster made his death all the sadder for Domon, as did his later realization that Master Asia was right about the Gundam Fight, and it all works to make it one of the saddest fights in the entire Gundam franchise.





 8  Gon Vs. Neferpitou 
Hunter X Hunter


 







  Episode   #131    Release Date   May 28, 2014    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Netflix    
Hunter x Hunter’s Chimera Ant arc was filled with plenty of tragic fights, but the one that stands out the most is Gon vs. Neferpitou. As Gon was forced to accept Kite’s death, all of his rage evolved his body to a point where he could defeat Pitou. In addition to how hard it was to see Gon fight so brutally, what made it tragic was that Gon’s transformation both nearly killed him and robbed him of the ability to use Nen. The incredible direction of the fight further highlights its seriousness, and it remains one of Hunter x Hunter’s most haunting moments.





 7  Spike Vs. Vicious 
Cowboy Bebop
        

  Episode   #26    Release Date   April 23, 1999    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
Another anime fight where the tragedy is sold even further by the direction is Spike and Vicious’ final fight in Cowboy Bebop. The fact that their fight happened at all was tragic on its own for showing that Spike couldn’t let go of the past in the end, but the animation and music provided perfectly sold just how much it was building to the tragedy of Spike’s death. One of the greatest strengths of Cowboy Bebop was its willingness to not end its story on a happy note, and Spike dying from picking a fight he didn’t have to is the ultimate culmination of all that.





 6  Yugi Vs. Atem 
Yu-Gi-Oh!


 







  Episodes   #221-#224    Release Dates   September 8, 2004-September 29, 2004    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Netflix, Hulu    
Tragic fights can also come about from two heroes facing off against each other, and a perfect example of that is Yugi vs. Atem in Yu-Gi-Oh! While Yugi needed to defeat Atem in their duel to both allow Atem to pass on the afterlife and prove that he could stand on his own, Yugi’s victory still meant that he had to say goodbye to one of his best friends and the person who was responsible for him growing up. It’s a bittersweet finale that greatly played into the strengths of Yu-Gi-Oh!, and it perfectly shows that a fight can be plenty tragic without anyone having to die.





 5  Luffy Vs. Usopp 
One Piece
        

  Episode   #236    Release Date   June 19, 2005    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix    
Another tragic anime fight that pitted two heroes against each other was Luffy vs. Usopp in One Piece. Luffy’s poor handling of the news that the Going Merry needed to be replaced, combined with Usopp’s refusal to accept it, led to Usopp quitting the crew and the two fighting for possession of Merry. There was never a chance Usopp could win, so his refusal to bend made every hit Luffy inflicted upon him incredibly painful to watch, and with Luffy forced to say goodbye to both his ship and one of his best friends, it easily stands out as one of the most tragic and emotional fights in all of One Piece.





 4  Sasuke Vs. Itachi 
Naruto: Shippuden
        

  Episodes   #135-#138    Release Dates   November 19, 2009-December 3, 2009    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Viz    
Naruto: Shippuden is another anime filled with tragic fights, and the one that stands out the most is undoubtedly Sasuke and Itachi’s fight. Sasuke finally got his revenge on Itachi, but any satisfaction he could gain from it was taken away when Obitio revealed that not only was Itachi ordered to kill the Uchiha clan to protect the Leaf village, but that he had secretly been protecting Sasuke the entire time Sasuke was hating him. That revelation changed everything Sasuke thought he knew about Itachi, but it was too late to do anything about it, and the tragedy of it all would define Sasuke’s character for the rest of Naruto.

 3  Majin Vegeta Vs. Majin Buu 
Dragon Ball Z
        

  Episodes   #236-#237    Release Dates   August 17, 1994-August 24, 1994    Where to Stream It   Funimation, Crunchyroll    
One of the most iconic tragic fights in anime is Majin Vegeta vs. Majin Buu in Dragon Ball Z. After finally accepting his change of heart, Vegeta attempted to atone for his recent actions by sacrificing himself to destroy Majin Buu, but despite how powerful of an attack he unleashed, Majin Buu ultimately survived. The point of Vegeta’s sacrifice was to show off how much he had grown as a person, so it more than got the job done, but the fact that he died without being able to hurt Majin Buu in the slightest still adds a great deal of tragedy to the fight, regardless.





 2  Global Alliance Vs. Eren 
Attack On Titan


 







  Episodes   The Final Chapters Part 1 &amp; The Final Chapters Part 2    Release Dates   March 4, 2023 (Part 1), November 5, 2023 (Part 2)    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
Attack on Titan’s anime long-awaited conclusion showed once again how tragic the fight between the Global Alliance and Eren was. It was one thing for Armin, Mikasa, and everyone else to have to fight Eren after being friends for so many years, but the reveal that Eren did everything he did to try and protect them made the Alliance’s victory very bittersweet. Even worse was the ending of the story showing that Paradis Island was still destroyed at some point in the future, meaning everything everyone did to protect their loved ones was pointless, thus adding another layer of tragedy to the fight and the ending, as a whole.
            
 
 Attack on Titan Ending Explained 
After running for a decade, Attack on Titan&#39;s anime finally comes to an end, and here&#39;s everything about the ending explained in full detail.








 1  Joe Vs. Mendoza 
Ashita no Joe
        

  Episodes   #124-#126    Release Date   August 17, 1981- August 31, 1981    Where to Stream It   Unavailable    
Perhaps the most iconic tragic fight in all anime is Joe vs. Mendoza in Ashita no Joe. As the bantamweight champion of the world, Mendoza served as Joe’s final and toughest opponent, and even though Joe refused to give up and frightened Mendoza to the point of making his hair turn white, not only did Joe lose by technicalities, he ended up dying from the injuries he suffered during the fight. It was a truly heart-wrenching note for the series to end on, and it’s since gone on to be one of the most iconic scenes in all anime.
As simple as action-based anime might get, they’re still capable of invoking a sense of tragedy with their fights. The death of a hero or a fallen friend is an easy way to accomplish that, but it also happens when the victory comes with such a big price that it makes the victor question if it was even worth it, and in most cases, it resoundingly wasn’t. That sense of tragedy, however, often adds a lot of depth to these stories, so an anime having a fight ending in tragedy can make it even better than it would have ever been.
