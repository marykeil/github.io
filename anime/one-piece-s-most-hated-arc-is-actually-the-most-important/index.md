# One Piece s Most Hated Arc Is Actually The Most Important


## SUMMARY 



  One Piece&#39;s Long Ring Long Island arc is undoubtedly the series&#39; most hated, with many fans referring to it as being canon filler.   Due to recent events in One Piece, like the destruction of Lulusia and the rising sea levels has led many to believe that Long Ring Long Island may have dropped a key hint at the location of the One Piece.   Despite its infamy, Long Ring Long Island remains an entertaining story arc within One Piece, and it could be making something of a return as the series approaches its finale.

## Literature Review

Long Ring Long Land may redeem itself as One Piece&#39;s most hated arc by bringing back these two concepts before the finale.




Long Ring Long Land is easily the most hated arc of One Piece among fans, however, a closer look at the concepts it introduces suggests it may end up being the most important. In fact, amidst the wacky shenanigans, silly games, and the best boxing match in the history of the series may lie clues to the future of One Piece.




Often disparaged as &#39;canon-filler&#39;, the Long Ring Long Land arc offers a much-needed reprieve between Skypeia and Water 7 and is easily among the funniest arcs of the series. That said, this arc may have introduced the most important concepts of the series yet including the idea of regularized flooding and the Davy Back Fight which could both play a crucial role in the series going forward.

                  One Piece Hints At The Real Reason Its World Is Covered In Oceans   Imu&#39;s latest actions in One Piece could explain why its world is so unusual, and the reason why it is mostly covered by water.   


 Laugh Tale May Re-Emerge Every Few Years Like Long Ring Long Land

Recent events in One Piece, such as the destruction of Lulusia by Imu and the ensuing rise in sea levels have shifted focus to the many submerged and currently flooding islands in the series. Of these, the curious island of Long Ring Long Land stands out the most. Much like Long Ring Long Land which reveals itself once every year, Laugh Tale may also be an island that re-emerges every few years for a brief while when water levels drop. According to a popular theory, the One Piece may even be submerged near Reverse Mountain and may re-emerge in time for Luffy and the Straw Hats to find it.




This theory may even explain why the World Government may have had such a hard time finding and eradicating the troublesome island of Laugh Tale over the last 800 years or so together with the hindrance posed by the well-hidden Road Poneglyphs. Having said that, Long Ring Long Land may also reveal the nature of the final battle for the treasure besides how it may be hidden.

          

The infamous Davy Back Fight first introduced on Long Ring Long Land may make an appearance in the finale of One Piece. In fact, with the Straw Hat crew headed to Elbaf the Davy Back Fight could make its way back into prominence with Elbaf being the origin of the traditional game. Moreover, fans have speculated the eventual showdown against Blackbeard or even the meeting with Shanks may end up being a Davy Back Fight that decides the next Pirate King.




Seeing as the Davy Back Fight has a well-established structure and set of rules in place, fan theories that the game will play a crucial part in the series aren&#39;t entirely misplaced. Having the finale involve a game instead of the typical, epic, shonen battle would also fit Oda&#39;s brand of humor and irony exceptionally, as One Piece has never shied from being unexpectedly silly.

At any rate, the matter of Long Ring Long Land&#39;s relevance to the story will likely be put to rest soon enough with the rapid progression and exposition Oda has indulged in as of late. Nonetheless, Long Ring Long Land remains one of the most entertaining arcs of the series with some touching moments of teamwork and bonding among the Straw Hats so perhaps its title as the most hated arc of One Piece may be misplaced after all.
