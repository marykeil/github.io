# Code Is Not Boruto s Worst Villain, He s A Genius Misdirection


## SUMMARY 



  Code is considered the most disappointing villain in the Naruto franchise, with a history of failing to live up to expectations.   However, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex may still have surprises in store, as creator Masashi Kishimoto has a history of subverting fan expectations.   The mistreatment of Code could be a deliberate misdirection, as Kishimoto often flips storylines to surprise readers.

## Literature Review

While prime Boruto antagonist Code continues to be embarrassed, the creators have fans just where they want them for his ultimate resurgence.




Warning: SPOILERS for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #3Despite the widespread scorn within the Boruto fandom for Code and the growing belief that he will be the next, and last, member of Kara to be killed off, the story may still reserve some huge surprises and rehabilitate this mistreated villain. Indeed, as Naruto fans can attest, creator franchise creator Masashi Kishimoto has a history of convincing fans that characters are weak only later to prove that they are the real threat everyone should have noticed.




While Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is full of questions and mysteries, one element of the story seems crystal clear - Code, the current Kara leader, is about as dangerous as he was in Boruto Part 1, which is, not too much. No matter what he does, or how powerful he seems, Code is invariably losing to anyone, and his humiliation seems to only be getting worse.

          

The latest embarrassment comes in Chapter #3 where he confronts Boruto, whom he had previously vastly outmatched and outpowered. This time around, Boruto unleashes his new Rasengan abilities. If Boruto is to be believed, the effect of the strike to so powerful that it&#39;s only a matter of time before Code succumbs to its effects. To many fans, the scene perfectly depicts how weak Code is - knocked out in the first round.





 Naruto Has A History Of Misdirections 
          

While fans may think Code is on his way out, the fact is this sub-plot could be a creative sleight of hand that will prove genius down the line. Perhaps the most illustrative evidence arguing that Code is not the underwhelming, disappointing villain that Boruto Part II portrays him to be, is the fact that Kishimoto and co-creator Ukyō Kodachi made him such a significant part of the story. The &#34;Code Assault Arc,&#34; which ran from chapters #56 to #67, highlighted Code as a major figure in the Boruto pantheon of villains. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense to generate such an important and detailed arc only to have its central figure constantly disappoint.

Besides that, several factors in the traditions of the Naruto-Boruto continuum strongly suggest that Code still has a major role to play in the story. If Kishimoto proved anything in this wind-down of Naruto is that the simplest and most practical idea or theory of how the story will progress is more than likely to be a red herring. In Naruto, Kishimoto consistently flipped storylines and characters to suit his purpose. Indeed, first Pain was identified as the ultimate villain only to be supplanted by Tobi, a character who was introduced as a comic relief, and turned out to be one of the main antagonists. Even in Boruto, Kawaki&#39;s betrayal and the upheaval at the end of part 1 came as a big surprise.






 Code&#39;s Mistreatment In Boruto Could Be A Genius Red Herring 
          

Considering the totality of circumstances, the possibility of Code &#34;going out like a punk&#34; - as some fans have recently described the situation - is highly unlikely. Currently, he presents the most credible threat to Boruto, Kawaki, and Konoha: his army of Claw Grimes, which are so dangerous that Boruto&#39;s main concern right now is to track down their source, Kara&#39;s Ten-Tails. Indeed, while Code has become a joke for Boruto fans, who like to point out how he&#39;s the epitome of a lackluster villain, his role in the story until now and Kishimoto&#39;s record point to the fact that Code&#39;s humiliations could be a red herring, and Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is ready to flip the script.
