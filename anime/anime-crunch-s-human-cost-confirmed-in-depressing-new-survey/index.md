## Literature Review

The human cost of anime creation is clearer thanks to a survey in Japan. High percentages of fatigue, exhaustion, and more are cause for concern.




A survey conducted by the Japan Animation Creators Association (JAniCA) indicates that numerous creatives are suffering from the pressure to produce anime. According to respondents, over 60% feel physical or mental fatigue. More alarmingly, 17% say they have experienced mental illness like depression. It is a sobering revelation about the human cost that goes into making anime.




With anime in great international demand, studios have been dealing with more projects. However, the survey results, which Japanese public broadcaster NHK and Japanese news site Sora News 24 brought to light, only further highlight the immense strain creative staff are under, as a result.

          

This environment of overwork could become a dark mark on the industry, which has already become controversial after tragic headlines alleging unreasonable deadlines from some of the anime industry&#39;s biggest studios.


 Anime&#39;s Constant Churn Creates Constant Stress 
          

JAniCA performs annual surveys to gauge the working conditions of the anime industry. Their latest iteration included questions about mental and physical well-being, which brought uncomfortable numbers to light. From 429 respondents, it is known that 66% say they feel they are suffering from physical fatigue, while 68% say they feel mentally fatigued. More alarmingly, 17% say they have developed or may have developed mental illnesses like depression. The complete survey is not publicly available, but NHK was able to report the known statistics. The broadcaster also noted that the survey was made &#34;last year&#34;, making the information slightly dated.




This information comes in light of recent controversies regarding overworked staff, most notably the series of social media posts by MAPPA staff who complained at length about the crunch involving Jujutsu Kaisen. Anime is not the only part of the industry where workers suffer - Kentaro Miura, author of the beloved Berserk series, who died in 2021 once famously said in a 2004 author comment, &#34;I haven&#39;t had two days off in a row for four years&#34;.

The anime industry&#39;s current boom is of no help either, since more Western companies are commissioning works based on their IPs, like the Suicide Squad Isekai. The survey ought to be a warning that current trends may not be sustainable for long, as personnel are neither infinite nor capable of being &#34;used up&#34; and replaced. If the environment becomes too hostile to bother entering, then the anime industry will have more to worry about than profit.
