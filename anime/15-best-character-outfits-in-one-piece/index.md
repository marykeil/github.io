 While this may not be Brook&#39;s best look of the series, it most surely is the most fun and experimental, earning it a spot on the list. The outfit in question consists of a fun, tri-color pastel afro, a blue and white striped t-shirt, and a bright pink pair of pants that together may just be the epitome of summertime. That said, while the hairdo does have him looking a lot like an ice cream cone, the ice cream hair might actually be a fitting look considering Brook&#39;s rather &#39;chilly&#39; powers.

Zoro makes quite the statement in One Piece: Film Gold with a look wildly different from his usual casual style. Zoro&#39;s Film Gold ensemble consists of a dashing white coat and vest paired with black slacks, a casually unzipped black shirt, and a loose white tie to give the look that laid-back feel usually present in Zoro&#39;s outfits. Nonetheless, this outfit proves Zoro can look just as suave as Sanji in a suit, if not more.





 12  Sanji&#39;s Onigashima Suit Oozes Elegance 
        

Being the ladies&#39; man he is, Sanji is always sharply dressed and his outfit during Onigashima Raid is no exception. The outfit consists of a red coat and trousers over a black shirt with a loose white tie and black gloves. While this outfit may be nothing out of the ordinary compared to Sanji&#39;s usual attire, it is certainly one of his most polished looks in the series, and simple as it may be, it sure does make him look every part the dreamy gentleman he is.

The outfit features a studded leather vest with the Charlotte symbol on the back, fitted black pants with a studded belt and spike-studded knee braces, and pointed shoes with spiky cowboy spurs to add to his macho exterior.





 7  Franky Rocks Spikes and a Glorious Mohawk in Film: Red 
        

Although One Piece Film: Red did mostly miss the mark in terms of costume design, it certainly hit the nail on the head with Franky&#39;s look that makes the Straw Hats&#39; shipwright look all but ready for an intense rock concert. Franky sports an edgy outfit decked out in spikes and buckles and a glorious spiky mohawk to match. With the addition of the studded gas mask, this outfit is surely one of Franky&#39;s most hardcore looks to date and perfect for fans of more punk, edgy fashion.

Doflamingo&#39;s outfit oozes confidence much like his personality.

The Warlord&#39;s bold, unique, wardrobe set him apart from the rest of the villains of One Piece as quite the charismatic figure and as much as fans may deny him one can&#39;t deny Doflamingo surely has a unique sense of style wholly his own.





 5  Robin&#39;s Enies Lobby Look is Straight Out of an Espionage Movie 
        

Robin&#39;s outfit on Enies Lobby arguably gives the Cipher Pol agents themselves a run for their money. The outfit features a slinky leather mini-dress unbuttoned at the top to reveal a hint of a purple-spotted white shirt. The dress is accompanied by chic black thigh-high leather boots that do wonders to highlight Robin&#39;s long legs. Simple as this outfit may be, it is surely one of Robin&#39;s most provocative looks to date and looks like it would fit right into a Bond movie.





 4  Brook&#39;s Film: Gold Outfit is by Far His Best 
        

Brook&#39;s outfit in Film Gold is as extravagant as it gets. the outfit consists of a dashing white double-breasted suit over a bright orange shirt and a cheetah print long coat over the top. And of course, Brook wouldn&#39;t be the King of Soul without his glitzy crown and retro sunglasses which are accompanied by a stylish gold lanyard for this look. The overall retro feel of the film and this outfit suit Brook exceptionally well making this outfit arguably one of Brook&#39;s best.





 3  Robin&#39;s Film: Gold Ensemble Encompasses 80s Style 
        

 Much like with Brook&#39;s outfit, Film: Gold especially nailed Robin&#39;s costume design. The look comprises a simple yet elegant white dress with a romantic flouncy hem and a bright blue feather boa that together with the gold accessories adds just the right amount of &#39;oomph&#39;. Overall, the outfit is oddly reminiscent of the 80s with just enough glamour and elegance, and the retro feel oddly suits Robin exceptionally well despite being quite different from her usual sense of style.

 2  Nami&#39;s Purple Zou Dress Is Jaw-Dropping Gorgeous 
        

Nami&#39;s purple dress from the Zou Arc has acquired iconic status over the years, and for good reason. Although her outfits are notoriously scandalous, especially after the time skip, the beauty of this look in particular hinges on it managing to be seductive while not revealing too much. While the lace-up detail on the sides accounts for the allure, the dainty strings of gold beads falling over her shoulders add that bit of sophistication needed to balance out the look, and of course, Nami&#39;s figure does the rest.





 1  Robin&#39;s Miss All Sunday Get-up is Simply Iconic 
        

 Robin&#39;s outfit in Alabasta is without a doubt the best character outfit in One Piece and easily the best of Robin&#39;s many looks over the years despite being the very first. The outfit consists of a purple plunging crop top that laces up the front and a purple miniskirt hemmed with white fringe trim. The outfit is topped with an extravagant, white fur-trimmed coat with gold embroidery and a white cowboy hat and boots to match. The distinct Wild West feel of the outfit especially helps Robin stand out as quite the memorable character right from the get-go and proves her title as one of the best-dressed characters in One Piece is well-deserved.
In all, costume design plays a crucial role in any story setting. It can often be an indicator of a character&#39;s background, personality, motivations, and even their role and destiny within the story. While One Piece is mostly known for its intricate mysteries, exciting battles, and incredible plot, the outfits on this list prove that Eiichiro Oda has a great eye for fashion too. These are certainly some of the best character outfits in One Piece and are excellent proof that the series never disappoints when it comes to costume design.
