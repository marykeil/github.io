## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Season 2 finale introduced viewers to a lot of important new information and dramatically shifted the series&#39; status quo.




Warning! Contains MAJOR SPOILERS for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2&#39;s finale!




Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season finale cemented it as a modern Shonen classic, but also likely left some fans confused given the complicated nature of its villain&#39;s actions and their ramifications for Season 3. This is not the first time that the series has thrown a lot of new information at its audience and expected them to keep up. In fact that is one of the many reasons that a lot of fans love the show and the manga it is based on.

Part of what makes Jujutsu Kaisen so confusing is its complex power system. Mangaka Gege Akutami has truly created one of the best Shonen power systems in modern years, but beneath the flashy battles lies a large amount of technical information. Parsing the difference between things like regular Cursed Energy and Reverse Cursed Technique along with the underlying mechanics of techniques like Simple Domain and Domain Expansion. While the fights can still be followed somewhat without a deep knowledge of these terms, having a firm grasp on Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s power system makes the series more enjoyable. Luckily, only one confusing part of the finale pertained to these complicated techniques.





 What did Pseudo-Geto Do? 
          

After the special grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo arrives at the end of the battle between the sorcerers and Geto&#39;s body, she asks him about his philosophy on Cursed Energy, hearkening back to a conversation she had at the end of the Gojo&#39;s Past arc. Yuki says that she wants humanity to transcend Cursed Energy, being free of it like one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most powerful charactersToji Fushiguro was. The Psuedo-Geto replies that he instead wants to optimize Cursed Energy, and to that end he uses Mahito&#39;s cursed technique that he absorbed in the previous episode to essentially create new sorcerers across Japan.

He is only able to do this since Mahito had developed his abilities immensely in the fight against Yuji and Todo. By using Mahito&#39;s ability to transform peoplesâ€™ bodies, and the bodies of regular humans differ in certain fundamental ways to those of sorcerers, he used his powers to bridge this gap for many humans he had singled out beforehand. With the sudden creation of new Cursed Energy users, Pseudo-Geto is hoping that this will lead to an overall rise in Cursed Energy, and that the inevitable conflict between these new sorcerers will lead to those who survive being the strongest of the bunch. Why exactly he wants this is unclear at this point, but will likely be explored further in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3.






 What Happened to Japan As a Whole 
          

After performing his transfiguration, Pseudo-Geto called forth a myriad of cursed spirits to protect himself and managed to escape with Gojo&#39;s prison realm. Given the massive scale of devastation in Tokyo, the government had to scramble to come up with an explanation for the public. In addition, with Gojo gone, a powerful safeguard against Curses vanished, putting the public at more risk than ever. Because of this, the government revealed the existence of Curses to the public, although they attempted to prevent mass panic by claiming they would only appear in Tokyo.



The Japanese government also has to deal with a power vacuum as many high-ranking officials are missing after the Shibuya Incident







Unfortunately for civilians, this didn&#39;t stop the newly emboldened Curses from feasting on the defenseless public. The finale didn&#39;t reveal the full extent of the new surge in Cursed attacks, but it did show some shocking instances of carnage as random people were killed. Part of this is due to Pseudo-Geto&#39;s machinations, as the rise of Cursed Energy benefits his plans for optimizing the country&#39;s supply of it. The exact way he is continuing to further his agenda and the public impact if this will be revealed in the recently announced Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3. Another big part of this of course is also Gojo&#39;s absence, but this isn&#39;t the only consequence of that.



 What&#39;s Going On With the Sorcerers? 
          

Gojo&#39;s presence didn&#39;t just stop Curses from running rampant, he was also powerful enough to stop the higher ups from doing whatever they wanted. These mysterious higher ups form the bureaucratic backbone of Jujutsu Society and can thus do a lot of damage if they wanted to. While they luckily may not be actively malicious, they clearly have an axe to grind against Gojo, which skewed their decisions at the end of the episode. This is unfortunate as they released 4 very important new edicts at the end of the finale that directly affect Yuji.




The first is an announcement that Geto is alive and that his death sentence is reinstated, which makes perfect sense given the havoc he wreaked. The second, however, seems to be purely based out of their hatred towards Gojo as they labeled him a co-conspirator in the Shibuya Incident, which is completely counter to reality. By labeling him an enemy, they are able to more easily justify their third and fourth announcements, which target sorcerers Gojo was protecting. The third calls for the death of principal Yaga, whose Cursed Technique offends many of these more traditional higher ups. The fourth calls for the execution of Yuji that Gojo stopped at the beginning of the series to be reinstated and names Yuta as the executioner.



 Who Is Yuta and Why Is He Back? 
          

For fans who haven&#39;t seen Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Yuta Okkotsu may be a confusing new inclusion to the series, as he was the main character of that movie but rarely mentioned outside of it. Even for fans who saw that movie, there are some questions surrounding Yuta, such as why he still seems to have access to Rika despite her soul being freed at the end of the movie and why he hates Yuji so much. The first likely has something to do with the training that he has undergone with the sorcerer Miguel during the events of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s show. The second is because of how deeply Yuta cares about his friends at Jujutsu High. Given that Sukuna hurt Inumaki during his rampage, this gives Yuta a grudge against Yuji.






Yuta is a special-grade sorcerer, which makes him one of the strongest characters in the anime.




Season 3 will likely dive further into Yuta&#39;s current motivation and abilities as he is set up to clash with Yuji, who is apparently on the run right now. For fans who are still confused, watching Season 3 will likely be the best way to answer any of their current questions. Unfortunately, that season is still some time away, so many of the questions raised in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Season 2 finale, such as the nature of Pseudo-Geto&#39;s ultimate plan and the fate of many characters will have to remain unanswered until then.
