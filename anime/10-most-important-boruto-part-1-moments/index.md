## Literature Review

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has breathed new life into Naruto&#39;s seque, naturally making fans wonder what Boruto&#39;s most important moments were.





Whether a direct action by its creators or an indirect result of circumstances, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations was marketed as a follow-up sequel to the groundbreaking Naruto series. Naturally, this generated a lot of hype in the fan base about how it would stack up the original series. However, while Boruto does maintain links to the older series, it nevertheless stretches the creative boundaries to get away from Naruto&#39;s shadow. Its duality is best illustrated in the saga&#39;s most important points which include both Naruto-centric elements and others that are purely born from Boruto.









 








 10  Sarada Awakes Her Dojutsu, Twice 
        

As an Uchiha, it wasn&#39;t surprising that Sarada would manifest a dojutsu, the Naruto world&#39;s special ocular ninja techniques that give a holder access to overpowered techniques. However, in Chapter # 80 of Boruto Sarada unlocked the all-powerful Mangekyo, a rare but advanced form of the Sharingan that manifests after a person suffers a particularly intense trauma. In her case, the trauma was seeing Boruto being put in mortal danger. With Mangekyo, Sarada has grown enormously more powerful than she was before. Sarada has since used the Mangekyo to convince her father to trust her claim that Boruto is not a threat. That, in itself, makes this an important moment if only for its impact on Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.





 9  Koji Is A Clone Of Jiraiya 
        

Koji Kashin was always an interesting character in Boruto. Not one known to be particularly social with the other members of Kara, he always seemed more comfortable operating on his own. Considering his plan was to kill Jigen, working alone seems a reasonable strategy. More importanlyt, however, was the surprising reveal that Koji is a clone of Naruto&#39;s mentor Jiraiya. Not only did that add a new means of understanding his hatred for Jigen, but also explained the way he approached the fight. With his disappearance in the aftermath of his fight with Jigen, he now provides an awesome potential &#34;x-factor&#34; in the storyline going forward. One that could affect either side of the upcoming battle.





 8  Momoshiki&#39;s Defeat 
        

As an Otsutsuki, and one of the major antagonists of Boruto Part 1, Momoshiki was an existential threat to Konoha Village, Naruto, and in some ways, his own clan member Isshiki. Accordingly, his defeat was necessary for everyone&#39;s continued survival. However, his defeat was of particular importance to Boruto. First, it pushed Boruto to new levels and understanding of his own abilities. To be so young and still be the main factor in the defeat of an Otsutsuki is a milestone that certainly advanced his development as a shinobi. More important was the fact that, in defeat, Momoshiki transferred his Kama to Boruto. This life-changing action permanently bound him to Boruto. The effects of this &#34;partnership&#34; were just beginning to be explored at the end of Part 1.





 7  Boruto&#39;s Death 
        

Although it was a planned move by Boruto and Kawaki to finally and fully eliminate Momoshiki as a threat, it was still a shocking moment for fans to experience the death of Boruto&#39;s main protagonist. More importantly, the plan backfired. It did the absolute opposite of what Boruto and Kawaki planned. Rather than kill off Momoshiki, it forced him to rescue Boruto by bonding with him on a genetic level and then using his powers and abilities to heal Boruto&#39;s injuries. As a result, Momoshiki was not eliminated but became a part of Boruto. Now, any attempt to eliminate Momoshiki must necessarily involve killing Boruto. This is most clearly illustrated in Kawaki&#39;s current hunt for Boruto, whom he believes is inseparable from Momoshiki.





 6  Isshiki Is Killed 
        

The original Otsutsuki, Isshiki, has terrorized the Earth since ancient times. He would have succeeded in his quest to cultivate a God Tree if it weren&#39;t for his partner Kaguya backstabbing him and leaving him for dead. Despite this setback, he did pretty well for himself by operating in the background for centuries, slowly biding his time and building up his network. The last piece for his return was finding a suitable vessel to possess. He thought he found it in Kawaki but was outdone by the young vessel, Naruto, and Sasuke. Just as with Momoshiki, killing Isshiki was necessary to save the community and the world. Nevertheless, it also led to the splintering of Kara, the rise of its cyborg members, and a disruption of the balance of power in the ninja world.





 5  Amado Comes Clean 
        

For most of Boruto&#39;s Part 1, Amado has been a mystery. He was Kara&#39;s chief scientist - the one responsible for arranging the kidnapping of children and experimenting on them in order to develop cyborgs, but he was also dedicated to seeing Isshiki/Jigen defeated. He later defected to Konoha after leaving Koji Kashin to fend for himself against Isshiki, but repeatedly failed to provide Konoha with key information that might have helped them get an earlier idea of what they were up against in Eida, Daemon, and Kawaki. Nevertheless, his decision to answer so many questions from Konoha&#39;s leaders, such as the mysteries of the kama and the history of the Otsutsukis, is a groundbreaking moment.





 4  Eida&#39;s Omnipotence Charm Spell 
        

Eida&#39;s charm power is a form of an Otsutsuki God-level jutsu that allows a possessor to alter the memories of anyone they want. It was used by Otsutsuki gods like Shibai to rewrite the minds of humans on several occasions. Eida, however, has no mastery of the ability. She can just create a blanket command for everyone, barring a few exceptions, to abide by her deepest desire - namely to be loved. However, when she was finally able to make an emotional connection with Kawaki in Chapter #79, his desire to be Naruto&#39;s son merged with hers. As a result, she beamed out a secondary command that rewrote the people&#39;s minds to think Kawaki is Boruto. As one of the biggest moments of Part 1, it absolutely flipped the script and made Boruto the enemy of humankind.





 3  Naruto Baryon Leads To Kurama&#39;s Death 
        

One of the fundamental facts of Naruto&#39;s world has been the sealing of Kurama into Naruto. It&#39;s a fact that led to many of the sorrows and joys in his life. Initially, Kurama did not like Naruto but eventually they developed a wholesome and supportive relationship. Nowhere was that more vividly illustrated than in Naruto&#39;s battle against Isshiki in Boruto Chapter #52. It was a leave everything on the mat battle that led to a never seen before advance in his fighting ability called Baryon Mode.
In Baryon Mode, Naruto and Kurama combined their energy to super-size Naruto&#39;s abilities, resilience, and strength. While it was necessary and helpful for the fight, it nevertheless drained so much of Kurama&#39;s energy, some of which he used to heal Naruto injuries, that he was not able to survive the fight. Kurama&#39;s death, which ended his life-long partnership with Naruto, is an important moment in both Naruto and Boruto





 2  Boruto&#39;s Unlocks His Jougan 
        

While covered with more detail in the anime, Boruto&#39;s unlocking the use of Jougan, an extremely rare and powerful dojutsu that gives users the ability to see the chakra energy levels of an opponent is nevertheless an important moment in Part 1 of the manga. This point is hinted at with Part 2&#39;s title - Two Blue Vortex. It suggests that it will play an important role in his future adventures. Interestingly, the times when he has manifested Jougan in Part 1, have been quite memorable in their own right.





 1  Boruto vs Kawaki 
        

Perhaps the most important moment of Part 1 is the moment that fans are introduced to in the very first scenes of the saga. That moment depicts Boruto and Kawaki atop Hokage Rock as they prepare to fight one another, seemingly to the death. While nothing more is revealed in Part 1 about the situation, the moment remains percolating in the background of the series - quietly influencing everything that comes afterward. No matter what situation Boruto or Kawaki find themselves in, readers know it would somehow affect this battle. Now finally in Two Blue Vortex, fans will see the conclusion to this first important moment.
With 80 chapters for fans to pour through, a lot of important things happened in Part 1 of Boruto that reshaped many aspects of both Boruto and Naruto. By understanding the most important moments in Boruto Part 1, fans and readers are in a good position to take on Two Blue Vortex fully prepared to understand the story going forward.
Boruto is now available from Viz Media.
