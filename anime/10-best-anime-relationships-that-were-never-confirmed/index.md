## Literature Review

It&#39;s very common for relationships in anime stories to never be explicitly confirmed, but this doesn&#39;t make some of them less memorable for fans.




While relationships are common in anime, some anime relationships never get confirmed. Sometimes it’s because there isn’t time in the story for a certain relationship to become official, and other times, the creator has no interest in making it happen. Whatever the case, a lot of anime end up making it impossible to see two characters as anything but a couple, yet this will never be officially confirmed.
A relationship in an anime can be plenty great even if it’s never confirmed, however, and there are a few that stand out as some of the best for how well their respective stories establish the couple’s rapport and how great a job they do of supporting one another, and in most cases, it gets to the point where there doesn’t need to be a specific label to see them as anything other than a couple.
        

All in all, there are plenty of anime that do a great job with romance while never explicitly establishing it, and something like that is plenty worth celebrating.
            
 
 10 Cutest Anime Couples 
Anime series are full of adorable young couples muddling their way through romance for the first time. Here are 10 of the cutest couples from anime.












 








 10  Ranma &amp; Akane Are Anime’s Most Iconic Will They/Won’t They 
Ranma ½, based on the manga by Rumiko Takahashi.
        

  Release Year   1989    Number Of Episodes   161    Where To Watch It   Hulu, Peacock    
The first great unconfirmed relationship to mention, and one of the oldest, is Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo from Ranma ½. Despite the constant slapstick and conflict with the myriad of other love interests, Ranma and Akane always had amazing chemistry that only got better as the series got along, and while the anime never got to it, the manga eventually had them finally admit to their feelings and get married. The wedding failed spectacularly and, in classic Rumiko Takahashi fashion, the manga ended with their relationship being sent back to square one, but it’s still impossible to see the two as anything other than a couple.

 9  Sesshomaru &amp; Kagura Showed That Rumiko Takahashi Doesn’t Need Slapstick 
Inuyasha, based on the manga by Rumiko Takahashi.
        

  Release Year   2000    Number Of Episodes   193    Where To Watch It   Hulu, Viz    
Another great, but unconfirmed, relationship in a Rumiko Takahashi work is the one between Sesshomaru and Kagura from Inuyasha. While feelings were only ever confirmed on Kagura’s end, Sesshomaru was all but stated to have been in love with Kagura as well, and their constant interactions throughout the series played a big part in Sesshomaru becoming a kinder person. The fact that a relationship was never confirmed didn’t make Kagura’s death any less tragic for both of them, and it showed that Takahashi is more than capable of writing romance without needing to balance it out with slapstick and other gags.

 8  Gash &amp; Tio Show That Even Kids Are Capable Of Romance 
Zatch Bell!, known in Japan as Konjiki no Gash!!, based on the manga by Makoto Raiku.
        

  Release Year   2003    Number Of Episodes   150    Where To Watch It   Hoopla    
Children in anime are just as capable of developing great relationships in anime as older characters, and a great, albeit unconfirmed, example of that is Gash and Tio from Konjiki no Gash! aka Zatch Bell! Zatch Bell! always did a great job of exploring the emotional depths of Gash and Tio’s relationship, and that was especially true in the final arc of the manga when Gash’s determination is the only thing keeping Tio from breaking down. Zatch Bell! recently received a sequel appropriately titled Zatch Bell 2!, and as such, it would be great if the series decided to finally make them an official couple at some point.

 7  Ash &amp; Serena’s Relationship Was A Welcome Change Of Pace For Pokémon 
Pokémon, based on the video game series by Game Freak and Nintendo.
        

  Release Year   1997    Number Of Episodes   1234    Where To Watch It   Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu    
Another great relationship between child characters in an anime that was only ever implied was Ash and Serena from Pokémon. Serena was the first and only time a female companion had feelings for Ash, and their dynamic both did a lot to develop their characters and added a welcome degree of maturity to Pokémon, as a whole. Serena kissing Ash and Ash being implied to reciprocate her feelings to some degree was the perfect way to cap off their arc, and while they never officially became a couple, it’s clear that their relationship has a level of intimacy Ash doesn’t share with any of his other female companions.

 6  Yusei &amp; Aki Proved That Yu-Gi-Oh! Was Capable Of Having Good Romance 
Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#39;s, produced by Studio Gallop.


 







  Release Year   2008    Number Of Episodes   154    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll    
Yu-Gi-Oh! isn’t a franchise known for romance, but a great, albeit unconfirmed, relationship to come out of the franchise was Yusei and Aki from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s. Yusei and Aki&#39;s relationship and the emotional bond between them did a great job of humanizing both characters throughout the series, and while they were never confirmed to be a couple, the finale all but says that they end up confessing their feelings to each other. Seeing that sort of development between them was great to see, and Yusei and Aki’s relationship still stands out as the strongest in the entirety of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise.

 5  Nagisa &amp; Kaede Were A Standout Shonen Anime Couple 
Assassination Classroom, based on the manga by Yūsei Matsui.
        

  Release Year   2015    Number Of Episodes   47    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
Shonen anime, in general, isn’t typically known for handling romance well, but a great relationship to be implied by one is the relationship between Nagisa and Kaede from Assassination Classroom. While a romance between Nagisa and Kaede was never truly teased until the final parts of Assassination Classroom, the two of them always had a great dynamic, and when the series did start teasing romance, it felt like a natural progression because of how much work had been done to sell their relationship up until that point. Nothing was ever explicitly confirmed in the end, but it’s hard to see Nagisa and Kaede as anything other than a couple, regardless.

 4  Yoruichi &amp; Sui-Feng Added A Lot Of Progressiveness To Shonen Anime 
Bleach, based on the manga by Tite Kubo.
        

  Release Year   2004    Number Of Episodes   392    Where To Watch It   Hulu    
Same-sex relationships in any story are often the ones that never get confirmed, and a great one to come out of an anime is Yoruichi and Sui-Feng from Bleach. Bleach did a lot to sell Yoruichi and Sui-Feng’s relationship as something beyond just a master-student dynamic through Sui-Feng’s sheer devotion to Yoruichi and the care Yoruichi showed for Sui-Feng in kind, and extra material like Can’t Fear Your Own World added even more to it. It’s very easy to see the two of them as a couple, and the fact that a shonen anime delivered that sort of positive representation, even if it was only implicitly, is nothing but admirable.

 3  Nanoha &amp; Fate Are The Quintessential Implicitly Gay Couple Of Anime 
Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, original series produced by Seven Arcs.


 







  Release Year   2004    Number Of Episodes   76    Where To Watch It   Amazon Prime    
Another great same-sex relationship that’s only implied, and one of the most famous examples, is Nanoha and Fate from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. Nanoha and Fate’s relationship goes through tremendous growth throughout the franchise to the point that they start living in the same house and adopt a child together, yet there’s never been any official confirmation about them being a couple, or even being attracted to women. It’s nothing but odd for there to be no confirmation about Nanoha and Fate’s relationship at this point, but even so, the intimacy and progression of their relationship still make it one of the strongest in all of anime.

 2  Kyon &amp; Haruhi Are One Of The Best Odd Couples In All Of Anime 
The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya, based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa and Noizi Ito.
        

  Release Year   2006    Number Of Episodes   28    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll    
The odd couple dynamic is one of the most classic relationship dynamics, whether it be romantic or platonic, and one of the best unconfirmed anime couples to have that dynamic is Kyon and Haruhi from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Kyon’s sensible realism was a perfect balance for Haruhi’s egocentrism, and the way they played off each other and inspired each other’s growth always made their relationship the most interesting one in the show. Neither the anime nor the light novels have them officially become a couple, but romantic feelings between them are always heavily implied, and overall, there’s never a moment when their relationship isn’t a boon to the story.

 1  Mustang &amp; Hawkeye Are One Of The Best Couples In Shonen, Despite Never Being Confirmed 
Fullmetal Alchemist, based on the manga by Hiromu Arakawa.


 







  Release Year   2009    Number Of Episodes   64    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
The last great anime couple that was never confirmed to discuss is Mustang and Hawkeye from Fullmetal Alchemist. Whether it’s the manga, the original anime, or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Mustang and Hawkeye’s relationship is always written in a way that’s all but stated to be romantic, and while there’s never any official statement of their being a couple, statements from series creator Hiromu Arakawa have implied that that’s solely because marriage would prevent them from working together. Mustang and Hawkeye’s relationship was always one of the best parts of Fullmetal Alchemist, and it easily stands out as one of the best anime relationships to never be explicitly confirmed.
