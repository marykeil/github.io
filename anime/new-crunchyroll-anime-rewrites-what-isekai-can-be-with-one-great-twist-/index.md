# New Crunchyroll Anime Rewrites What Isekai Can Be With One Great Twist 


## SUMMARY 



  The new Crunchyroll anime series 16bit Sensation: Another Layer offers a unique twist on the typical isekai genre, transporting the protagonist not to a high fantasy world, but to the past, where the game she loves is still in production.   The parallels between Akisato&#39;s original predicament and the world she gets transported to are intriguing, with the company that published the game being headquartered in the same building as her current workplace and both companies struggling in their respective fields.   While not catering to those seeking a stereotypical isekai, 16bit Sensation: Another Layer provides a refreshing and fun experience for viewers who are either tired of the genre or enjoy seeing it subverted in a clever way. The anime still maintains the strong themes and metaphors that anime enthusiasts appreciate.

## Literature Review

First-time viewers will actually benefit more from the twist in 16bit Sensation: Another Layer by reading the synopsis before watching the anime.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for 16bit Sensation: Another Layer on Crunchyroll!




The premise of the new Crunchyroll anime series 16bit Sensation: Another Layer is similar to any other stereotypical Isekai, but rather than the hero getting transported to a high fantasy world that most anime fans would expect, viewers are given something else entirely – and it works shockingly well. While different, the twist works, since the series&#39; overall theme and this new world are deeply connected.

Anyone who has watched isekai would think that the world in which16bit Sensation&#39;s sub-illustrator and bishojo game otaku Konoha Akisato gets transported to after opening a game would be the game&#39;s word. However, this doesn&#39;t happen in 16bit Sensation: Another Layer, which adapts the manga 16bit Sensation: The Bishojo Game Made by All of You and I by Misato Mitsumi, Tatsuki Amazuyu, Tamiki Wakaki, and Wakaki. Instead, she gets sent to the past, ironically, a point in time where this mysterious game is still in production.

There are even more correlations between Akisato&#39;s original predicament and the world she gets transported to. The first and undoubtedly most mysterious is that the company that published the game is headquartered in the same building as the current game company where Akitsato works in the present day. Even more curious is that both companies were at the bottom of their respective fields. Another strong parallel is that Akisato always struggled with the current state of the gaming industry in the present day because it was much too bloated. As a result, it was much more difficult for a bottom-tier company like hers to make an objectively good Bishōjo game. It&#39;s also serendipitous that she&#39;s enamored by the classics because she gets transported into a world where the industry is just beginning.

Although it would be amusing to see an otaku who&#39;s obsessed with cute girls interacting with the cutest heroines within an actual bishojo game, it&#39;s been done before. 16bit Sensation is providing something similar but with an intriguing enough of a twist to keep even isekai purists entertained. Interestingly, viewers who went into the anime either blind or having read the official synopsis each had a very different experience. Those in the latter group were set up to believe that this would be a normal isekai because the big twist – time travel – is buried. However, the anime actually begins after Akisato is transported. All viewers know is that she somehow time traveled. It&#39;s only after exploring a flashback leading up to these events that audiences see the allusions to this being a normal isekai.




          

In the end, those who want a stereotypical isekai will likely not gravitate towards 16bit Sensation. However, the anime is a fun experience for those who have either had enough of the genre or enjoy seeing something so formulated subverted in a fun way. Regardless, Crunchyroll&#39;s 16bit Sensation: Another Layer features the same strong themes and metaphors that anime enthusiasts appreciate about the genre, so there should be enough for everybody.

16bit Sensation: Another Layer is streaming on Crunchyroll.
