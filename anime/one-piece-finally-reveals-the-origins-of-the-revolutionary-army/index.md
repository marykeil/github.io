## Literature Review

One Piece reveals how the Revolutionary Army went from humble beginnings to major threat to the World Government after Dragon met another character.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #1097 of One Piece. One Piece has at long last revealed the origins of the Revolutionary Army led by Luffy&#39;s father Dragon, and in particular the events surrounding its inception that led to its founding members crossing paths. Despite having acquired immense notoriety within the world of One Piece and outside of it, the Revolutionary Army and its members have remained largely an enigma. Fortunately, the latest chapter of One Piece hints the series may soon put many of these doubts to rest.




Chapter #1097 of One Piece delves into Kuma&#39;s life in the Sorbet Kingdom following the fated God Valley Incident and reveals how Kuma ended up crossing paths with Dragon and Ivankov after his fateful, unexpected meeting with the latter on God Valley.

          

Though the series already revealed as early as chapter #1066 that Dragon formed the Revolutionary Army with Ivankov and Kuma following the Ohara incident, the latest chapter of One Piece finally provides further insight into the events leading up to their fateful meeting and expands on the formation of the Revolutionary Army.

                  One Piece Confirms A Major Theory About Luffy&#39;s Father   After years in the shadows, One Piece has finally revealed a key detail about Dragon that confirms one of the biggest theories about him.   





 Dragon Founded the Revolutionary Army When Kuma Joined Him And Ivankov 
          

Chapter #1097 of One Piece reveals the Revolutionary Army, previously known as the Freedom Fighters, was created in its current form only upon Kuma&#39;s joining twenty-two years ago. Kuma joined Dragon and the Freedom Fighters upon Ivankov&#39;s invitation after they rescued him and Ginny from imprisonment and saved the Sorbet Kingdom by overthrowing its previous exploitative ruler. The chapter suggests Kuma played a key role in the formation of the Revolutionary Army, and it was only after he joined that the Freedom Fighters underwent a transformation and acquired notoriety.

The revelation suggests Kuma might&#39;ve been more crucial of a member of the Revolutionaries than earlier believed and paints his relationship with them in a new light. Moreover, his long history with the Army explains the Revolutionaries&#39; strong reactions to him losing his sense of self and recontextualizes certain interactions with Kuma in the present. Ivankov&#39;s reaction to Kuma not being able to recognize him at Marineford now becomes even more meaningful, after learning that Kuma promised to never forgive Iva&#39;s face after they escaped slavery together. Kuma&#39;s close relationship with Dragon might also finally explain his inexplicable behavior towards the Straw Hats both on Thriller Bark and Sabaody.




Nonetheless, the Revolutionary Army has spent the majority of the series in the shadows and is yet to display its full strength and military prowess. Fortunately, seeing as One Piece has finally revealed the origins of the Revolutionary Army, fans will likely see them take center stage soon enough as the series dives deeper into its Final Saga.
