## Literature Review

Gojo&#39;s defeat has left fans devasted but the series may yet have more heartbreak and tragedy in store, especially for Sukuna&#39;s unfortunate vessel.





Gojo&#39;s defeat in chapter #236 of Jujutsu Kaisen has sparked many theories about how the story and the battle against Sukuna might progress. Although fans have steeled themselves for the worst, one scenario is particularly frightening and may finally break what little resolve fans of the series have left. Fans have especially expressed their fragile will to continue the series for fear of more heartbreak on platforms like X, best encapsulated by this this post by user JYV: &#34;I&#39;ll honestly never read Jujutsu Kaisen again.&#34;




 : Jujutsu Kaisen Uses Its Ending For A Twist That&#39;s Absolutely Brutal


 Seeing Gojo&#39;s Dead Body Would Break Megumi Further 

 

Sukuna has already broken Megumi&#39;s spirit by using his body to kill his sister and harm both Yuji and Maki. However, the chilling possibility of Sukuna showing Megumi Gojo&#39;s dead body would certainly break him beyond return. Sukuna has not only killed his only family but also arguably the only father figure in Megumi&#39;s life and is very well on his way to wipe out his other friends as well, especially Yuji considering Sukuna&#39;s apparent grudge against him. As the original post points out, Sukuna&#39;s sadistic tendencies stood out most in Shibuya when he let Yuji take back control after his rampage and told him to take a good look at the devastation he had caused with Yuji&#39;s body, reveling in his moral anguish. While Sukuna doesn&#39;t seem to have such a grudge against Megumi, he is still very prideful and might do so simply to gloat.






 Megumi&#39;s Fate Is Key For Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Future 
          

That said, as much Sukuna might enjoy tormenting Megumi, it isn&#39;t clear whether doing so is possible. Megumi is likely in a vegetative state from bearing the burden of Gojo&#39;s Infinite Void. Moreover, Sukuna seemed to have gained complete control of Megumi&#39;s body after the bath ritual he conducted in Chapter #216 and killing Tsumiki. At the moment, it is uncertain whether Megumi&#39;s soul can re-emerge from the darkness, though Gojo&#39;s death and the threat to the rest of the sorcerers may spur him back into consciousness.

Nonetheless, a development so tragic would certainly elicit strong reactions from fans. Jujutsu Kaisen has already broken many hearts since the Shibuya Arc with the departure of many beloved characters and Gojo&#39;s death has only pushed fans further along the edge.




Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Viz Media.
