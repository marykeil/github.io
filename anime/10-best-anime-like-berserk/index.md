It&#39;s no surprise that fans are on the lookout for the best anime like Berserk. After all, no franchise has moved the needle for the dark fantasy genre quite like Kentaro Miura&#39;s masterpiece. Since its publication in 1989, Berserk has become the subject of two anime series, three films, and three video games. Even popular video games like Elden Ring and Dark Souls borrow heavily from Berserk&#39;s legacy. With the recent release of Chapter 375 of the manga, it&#39;s clear that Guts&#39; revenge-fueled journey continues to capture audiences nearly 35 years later.
With the tragic passing of Berserk creator Miura in 2021, and the continuation of the manga by his team, Studio Gaga, many fans predict Berserk may soon be winding down. Though this has left many with a premature behelit-sized hole in their hearts, there are still plenty of anime out there that recapture Berserk&#39;s magic. Whether they be gritty, high-stakes, character-driven, or a combination of the three, the best anime like Berserk are not to be missed.









 








 10  Devilman Crybaby Channels the Same Lovecraftian Horrors 
Anime by Science SARU &amp; Based on the Manga By Go Nagai


 







Released on Netflix in 2018, Devilman Crybaby is an avant-garde update of Go Nagai&#39;s Devilman series of the 1970s. It follows Akira Fudo, a bleeding heart whose friend, Ryo Asuka, convinces him to merge with a devil. Berserk fans know that Miura was heavily inspired by Go Nagai&#39;s manga, and there&#39;s no denying that Akira and Ryo bear a strong resemblance to Guts and Griffith, especially in this recent adaptation. Most notably, Devilman Crybaby&#39;s Lovecraftian, cosmic horror directly parallels the events of the Eclipse at the end of Berserk&#39;s Golden Age arc.

 9  Fist of the North Star has a Protagonist Who Inspired Guts 
Anime by Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Buronson and Tetsuo Hara
        

A mid-80s classic, Fist of the North Star chronicles the adventures of warrior and martial artist named Kenshiro who destroys his opponents in exceptionally violent ways. Not only is it one of the most influential anime of all time, it is also, according to Miura, the biggest inspiration for his own work. While Fist is arguably less character-driven than Berserk, Kenshiro&#39;s ridiculously strong physique bears remarkable similarities to Miura&#39;s Guts. For those who want a crash course in anime classics, don&#39;t miss out on this action-packed show.

 8  The Rose of Versailles has Court Intrigue and Invests in its Characters 
Anime by Tokyo Movie Shinsha &amp; Based on the Manga By Riyoko Ikeda
        

It may surprise some that a shojo classic like The Rose of Versailles would even be compared to Berserk. However, Miura himself said he took inspiration from this historical anime when creating his dark fantasy world. As gory and disturbing as Berserk can be at times, its characters always come first, and audiences have shojo tropes, such as those in Versailles, to thank for that. Additionally, much of Berserk&#39;s court intrigue bears similarities to that of Lady Oscar&#39;s in Versailles as she serves Marie Antoinette. Fans will also observe that Griffith&#39;s physical appearance and attire at court match that of Lady Oscar, right down to the epaulets.

 7  Vinland Saga Has a Similar Gritty Medieval Setting 
Anime by Wit Studio &amp; Based on the Manga by Makoto Yukimura


 







Comparisons between Vinland Saga and Berserk have been made ever since the Viking epic&#39;s anime adaptation launched in 2019. From the gritty medieval setting to some of the best character designs in anime history, Vinland Saga is sure to whet the appetite of any Berserk fan. Interestingly, Vinland&#39;s main character, Thorfinn, starts out seeking vengeance and becomes more of a pacifist, nearly the opposite of Guts&#39; journey. However, antagonist Canute&#39;s rise to power shares eerie similarities with that of Griffith. Both Vinland Saga and Berserk have been compared to Game of Thrones, so fans of that high-fantasy series will find a lot to love here.

 6  Ninja Scroll is Exceptionally Violent 
Anime by Madhouse With Characters by Yoshiaki Kawajiri
        

With its lone wolf protagonist, demonic adversaries, and horrifically bloody fight scenes, there is much overlap between Berserk and the 1993 anime film Ninja Scroll. Some have even noted that the movie&#39;s tough-as-nails Kagero, and her romance with Jubei, as quite similar to Berserk&#39;s Casca and her relationship with Guts. Ninja Scroll set a new bar for the level of sex and violence in anime, pushing the envelope in much the same way Berserk does. With that in mind, this stylistic, gory tale is not for the faint of heart.

 5  Dororo Contains Themes of Sacrifice and Revenge 
Anime by Studio MAPPA &amp; Based on the Manga by Osamu Tezuka
        

Like Berserk, Dororo has had incredible staying power. Its first anime adaptation aired in 1969, but Studio MAPPA rebooted it in 2019, fleshing out the characters and storyline. Set in the distant past, the greedy samurai Daigo would do anything for power, much like a certain white-haired antagonist Berserk fans know well. He sacrifices his son Hyakkimaru&#39;s body parts to various demons, and Hyakkimaru must journey to get his body back and take revenge on the one who betrayed him. Though Hyakkimaru is much quieter and gentler than the cynical Guts, there&#39;s no denying the similarities between the two characters.

 4  Psycho-Pass Has a Similar Villain to Griffith 
Anime by Production I.G
        

Psycho-Pass, like Berserk, subverts audiences&#39; ideas about what a villain looks like and how they behave. The former&#39;s main antagonist, Shogo Makishima, is charismatic, even-tempered, and one of the smartest anime villains of all time, much like Berserk&#39;s Griffith. They are also physically beautiful in a way that is almost otherworldly, and those angelic looks contrast sharply with their nefarious deeds. Makishima and Griffith are also good at rationalizing their actions to themselves -- Makishima due to his scrupulous, philosophical mindset, and Griffith because of his deep-seated issues with guilt and self-loathing.

 3  Attack on Titan is not Afraid to get Bleak 
Anime by Wit &amp; MAPPA Studio &amp; Based on the Manga by Hajime Isayama Much like Berserk, Attack on Titan has no qualms about killing off beloved characters before viewers can fully process what has happened. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are all strugglers in their own right, much like Guts, in their battle against larger-than-life beings. Griffith&#39;s downward spiral also parallels Eren&#39;s descent into villainy, both of which are the perfect culmination of each character&#39;s story. With a similar medieval setting, intriguing protagonists, and characters who endeavor to survive against all odds, Attack on Titan has a lot to keep diehard Berserk fans happy. The final season wrapped on November 5th, so newcomers have a well-rounded, conclusive story to look forward to. Watch On Crunchyroll





 2  The End of Evangelion is Just as Trippy as the Eclipse 
Anime by Gainax &amp; Production I.G With Characters By Hideaki Ano


 







Mention the Eclipse to any Berserk fan, and reactions will be those of shock, grief, and outrage. The conclusion to Berserk&#39;s Golden Age arc may have been horrific, but it also amounted to some of the best episodes of television ever made. The End of Evangelion concludes Shinji&#39;s story in a similarly violent and trippy nature, with heaps of body horror and abstract imagery. From the destruction of the Angel Lilith to Shinji and Asuka rematerializing on a post-apocalyptic shoreline, Evangelion does far less to explain its chain of events than Berserk does. Nevertheless, it is still worth the watch and is considered one of the best animated films of all time.

 1  Legend of the Galactic Heroes Focuses Heavily on War and Politics 
Anime by K-Factory &amp; Based on the Novel By Yoshiki Tanaka
        

On a surface level, Legend of the Galactic Heroes&#39; sci-fi setting looks quite different from Berserk&#39;s ambiguously medieval one. However, both series are chock-full of carnage and political intrigue. Some characters are similar, too -- Legend&#39;s Reinhard von Lohengramm resembles Griffith closely in appearance, methods, and tactical genius. One notable difference, however, is that protagonist Wen-li Yang is unable to go against the orders of his superiors, unlike Guts, who is deemed a &#34;mad dog&#34; by fellow members of the Band of the Hawk. For an anime classic with intelligent, complex characters, Legend of the Galactic Heroes should be next on any Berserk fan&#39;s list.
