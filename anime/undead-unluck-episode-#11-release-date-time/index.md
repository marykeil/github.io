 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 11? 
          




In Undead Unluck episode #11, “Result”, the Union gathered to receive their rewards for completing their quests, some of which included a new seat on the Roundtable and the unification of all languages into English. However, the Union failed to complete one quest, the capture of the Negator Unseen, because he was captured by Unrepair before they could locate him, so they suffered the penalty of the addition of UMA Galaxy. As the name would imply, UMA Galaxy created stars, planets, and alien life in the universe, and immediately afterward, an alien army showed up to try and take over Earth.

                  Undead Unluck: Every Union Member &amp; Their Abilities Explained   The Union is the main heroic group of Negators in Undead Unluck, and here&#39;s a breakdown of every character and their various abilities in the series.   

Juiz managed to make short work of the aliens thanks to her Negator ability, Unjustice, causing the aliens to attack each other, but she still made a point about how dangerous penalties can be. Juiz also revealed that the Union has suffered 99 penalties, and if they suffer two more, God will instigate Ragnarok and destroy the world. It was also brought up that quests can only be taken when every seat on the Roundtable is filled, so for the sake of being able to continue their fight against God, Fuko, Andy, and Tatiana prepare to head to Rio de Janeiro and recruit Unrepair into the Union.






 Undead Unluck Is Setting Up A Conflict Between Negators 
          

The biggest takeaway from Undead Unluck episode #10 is that it sets up a conflict between the Union and other Negators who exist in the world. Unrepair’s dialogue with Unseen heavily implies that he’s actively working against the Union for some reason, so even if the Union tries to recruit him, their efforts are only going to start a fight with him and whoever else he might be working with. Seeing that conflict play out is bound to do a lot to flesh out the story, so it will be great to see what Undead Unluck episode #11 does with it.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #11 when it releases on December 15.
