## SUMMARY

The episode also showcases custom Poké Balls that serve as aesthetic additions, reflecting trainers&#39; love for specific Pokémon and adding depth to Pokémon Horizons&#39; lore.

## Literature Review

A run-in with a Poké Ball artisan leads to the anime showing off a number of completely original Poké Balls that have never appeared in the games.




Warning: SPOILERS for episode #29 of Pokémon HorizonsPokémon Horizons hasn&#39;t been afraid to leave its mark on the series, and the latest episode offers a fresh new take on one of the franchise&#39;s key elements: the Poké Ball. A run-in with a Poké Ball artisan leaves Roy with a number of experimental balls to try out, including some that fans of the series might actually be interested in seeing brought to life in the games.




After Roy nearly had his Ancient Poké Ball swiped by an untrustworthy antiques dealer, the dealer provided the team with the contact info for a Poké Ball collector, who turned out to be the artisan known as Karna. Karna has a Poké Ball factory that makes custom Poké Balls for people, and in her spare time collects rare balls and devises her own experimental types of Poké Balls, many of which differ quite a bit from a conventional ball.

          

In episode #29 of Pokémon Horizons, Roy discovers the box of prototypes and eagerly asks if he can give them some practice throws, a request which Karna gladly agrees to.



Pokémon Horizons&#39; English dub is set for a 2023 release, but no more specific date has been announced.








 Pokémon Horizons Has Some Genius Poké Ball Ideas 
          

The box included a number of different Poké Balls, each with their own unique effects. Roy first tries the Rocket Ball, which launches forward in a straight line (akin to a more modern version of the Jet Ball in Pokémon Legends Arceus), making it easy to aim Poké Balls. Roy has less success with his next choice, the Boomerang Ball, which does exactly as it says and boomerangs back around to the trainer&#39;s hand when thrown. He then tries a Bomb-Bomb Ball, which explodes in his hand, and finally a Chase Ball, which automatically locks onto the nearest Pokémon and tracks it down on wheels.

While many of the Poké Balls don&#39;t function quite right, either not opening at all or opening far too early, the ideas behind these Poké Balls actually seem pretty useful, both in the world of Pokémon and in a video game context. It&#39;s easy to see how a Rocket Ball might be useful for those with difficulty aiming, for example, and the Boomerang Ball would ensure little waste, as it will simply return to the trainer&#39;s hand if it doesn&#39;t connect with a Pokémon. The Chase Ball, easily the oddest of the bunch with its wheels, could definitely see some use in an Arceus-like game where the aiming isn&#39;t done for the player, taking off like a remote control car and ramming into Pokémon for ease of catching.




          

Custom Poké Balls have appeared in the anime before, during Ash&#39;s time, but these were generally aesthetic customizations, such as a jewel-encrusted ball for a wealthy trainer, or a small marking, like the thunderbolt on Pikachu&#39;s ball. There are some purely aesthetic custom balls in this episode as well, showing that trainers who really love a particular Pokémon will shell out big bucks for a nice Poké Ball for their Pokémon. It&#39;s an excellent bit of added lore for Pokémon Horizons, and some of the balls seen in this episode would be very interesting to see in a Pokémon game at some point in the future.

               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
