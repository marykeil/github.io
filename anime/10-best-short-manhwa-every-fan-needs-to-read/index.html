<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>For fans who don&rsquo;t have much time to spare, these outstanding short manhwa stories provide experiences that are as memorable as they are impactful.</p>
<p>The manhwa medium is diverse, including works ranging from short yet memorable ones to much lengthier ones that take their time to build an immersive world and develop their characters through various events. While both have their advantages and disadvantages, fans with little time to invest in new titles might be more interested in finding out which the best short manhwa are.
Due to their limited scope, short manhwa naturally lack the ability to create complex worlds and tell complicated stories, full of unexpected twists and turns. However, they are still more than able to tell meaningful, emotional stories that are unlikely to lose their focus along the way, and that viewers will certainly find memorable and impactful. Whether they fall under the drama, romance, or even horror genres, there are plenty of worthwhile options for fans to look into.
For this list, short manhwa are defined as those whose stories are completed within up to 50 chapters, though the length of the individual chapters may vary.</p>
<p>10  Immortal Regis (44 Chapters)
Based on the Novel by JYU Deo &amp; Illustrated by JUDER</p>
<p>Jae Hyuk Chae is an ordinary high school student who works hard to take care of himself and his sickly younger brother. One night, while he is taking his brother to the hospital, he proves unfortunate enough to come across Serin, a powerful demon who kills him by accident while fighting another demon. But Serin turns out to be a necromancer, as she ends up bringing him back from the dead and turning him into an undead, immortal being, thereafter dragging him to her world, Chaos.
Immortal Regis is a title that is most likely to appeal to fans of classic shonen-type stories, as it follows many familiar tropes. While its action-oriented story and supernatural setting may seem somewhat generic, the characters and their development are quite original, creating an entertaining experience that feels simultaneously familiar and refreshing, and resulting in a remarkable action manhwa.
There is also a longer sequel to Immortal Regis, named Cavalier of the Abyss, but it is rather contentious among fans, with many preferring the original story instead.</p>

Whether she&rsquo;s dealing with immortal vampires and their complicated love situations, or cats who struggle with their own romantic problems, Pamela is always eager to help anyone. As a result, she tends to attract the attention of eccentric supernatural beings more often than not, whose dilemmas never fail to intrigue her.
While its formula is mostly episodic, with new characters being introduced constantly, The Tarot Café manages to make all of its characters interesting, from the complex protagonist to the charming side characters.

Afraid of his daughter&rsquo;s reaction to his unsightly scars, Gang-Ho begins wearing the costume of &ldquo;Gugu-man&rdquo;, a fictional hero, and watching over his family from afar, protecting them in his own way.

Original Series Written by Yo-Han &amp; Illustrated by Hye-Jin Kim</p>
<p>Yun-lee Lee is a young girl whose life is greatly affected by a traumatic accident, due to which she loses 2 precious years of her life at a crucial time, between the ages of 19 and 21.

One day, on her way to feed some stray cats, an activity she often finds solace in, she ends up running into Dong-hwi Ju, a boy who seems to have exactly what she lost and yearns for.
Although its story is neither elaborate nor remarkably innovative, Nineteen, Twenty-One provides a wholesome, heartwarming experience that proves to be as thoughtful as it is soothing. Everything about it is simply uplifting, including the romance scenes, which, surprisingly enough, are not the title&rsquo;s only focus. In particular, this is a work that should especially appeal to cat owners, as it revolves around these beloved pets and their interactions with various characters.
Hye-Jin Kim, the artist behind Nineteen, Twenty-One, is also credited as the illustrator of other popular titles, including Girls of the Wild&rsquo;s and Eleceed.</p>
<p>4  About Death (28 Chapters)
Original Series Written by Sini &amp; Illustrated by Hyeono</p>
<p>In a space that can neither be described nor pinpointed, there is a man with no predetermined appearance, who simply calls himself &ldquo;God&rdquo;. God meets and judges various people on the verge of death, asking them meaningful questions and giving them opportunities to reflect on their experiences and final moments. Whether they are simple people who died tragic deaths, unfortunate ones who felt forced to suffer untimely ends, or even criminals whose relationship with death is clearly more complicated, everyone is judged equally and no one can escape the end of life.
About Death is a thought-provoking anthology of short yet impactful stories that is as simple as it is intricate.

<p>1  The Horizon (21 Chapters)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Ji-Hun Jeong</p>
<p>In a world defined by a devastating ongoing war, nothing is recognizable anymore. The landscape has changed, people have died, and the city is in ruins.

After falling asleep in an abandoned bus, which is as comfortable as he can get, he encounters a girl whose situation seems not too dissimilar from his own. Unable to so much as exchange a few words, the two silently decide to walk on together.
The Horizon tells a bleak yet realistic story about tragedy and loss, without hesitating to showcase the worst of humanity. Understanding the true strengths of the medium, it excels in terms of visual storytelling, bringing the world to life not through endless exposition, but rather through tangible images. The story is depressing and thought-provoking, and the artwork is often disturbing and painful, but these are facets of life that sadly cannot be ignored. Overall, this outstanding title is not only one of the best manhwa on Webtoon, but also one of the best short manhwa.
Ji-Hun Jeong, the author of The Horizon, also created The Boxer, which, despite its completely different theme and length, remains a genuinely worthwhile title.</p>
