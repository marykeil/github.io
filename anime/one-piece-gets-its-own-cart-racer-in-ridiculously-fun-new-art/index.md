## Literature Review

One Piece fan art is pitting the Straw Hat Pirates against one another in a friendly cart race, putting the crew in a fiercely fun new battle.




One Piece’s beloved characters have received a fun makeover in fan art placing them in their own cart race. Titled One Piece on the Road, it captures all the excitement of kart racing with an anime twist. If any group could make a thrilling and hilarious cart race, it’d be Luffy’s Straw Hat Pirates.




Shared on X, this fan art from @redbeanp13 features Luffy in the lead of a six-kart race. The competition is full of its own obstacles and complications, similar to popular games like Mario Kart and other themed games with playable fan-favorite characters. These have included Crash Team Racing, Disney Speedstorm, and Nickelodeon Kart Racers. 


 

Now, a fan has imagined what it’d be like if mangaka Eiichiro Oda’s hit characters were to have a race of their own in the same vein. Based on this humorous rendering, a racing game centered on Shonen Jump characters would be incredibly fun and allow for many manga and anime characters, powers, and settings to be imagined in a thrilling way.

                  Shonen Jump is The Best It&#39;s Been In Years: Here&#39;s Why   Shonen Jump has improved on a lot of complaints that readers have had, and its flagship series have all had incredibly exciting arcs recently.   





 One Piece Hits the Race Track in Fan Art 
          

In this fan art, Luffy leads the way with a monkey trailing behind him, tossing back a banana peel. Behind him are Nami, Sanji, and Usopp. On a distant cliff, Roronoa Zoro can be seen heading in the wrong direction as more animals instruct him to reverse direction. Each of the Straw Hat Pirates has a custom logo on their carts, matching their characters. Monkey D. Luffy’s cart has a skull and crossbones reminiscent of his crew’s flag. Nami has an orange on hers, harkening back to both her debut in the Orange Town arc and life in Cocoyasi Village which is full of orange groves.

Sanji’s logo is naturally a fork and spoon, highlighting his skills as a chef. While Usopp and Zoro’s can’t be seen, it’d be likely that one would feature slingshots or Usopp’s specialty goggles, while the other would have multiple swords. While special abilities are not illustrated here, it stands to reason that each driver’s personal skill set would lend them some special abilities that would be incredibly fun to see in action. It isn’t unusual for Shonen Jump characters to face off, such as in games specific to each franchise or crossovers like Shonen Jump Force. With One Piece’s characters frequently in seafaring situations and swashbuckling adventures, it’d be nice to see them unwind in a cart race.






 Luffy is Always Eager for Another Adventure 
          

The adventurous nature Luffy has is what has allowed him to complete so many feats and garner such an impressive crew. He refuses to back down or to have limitations forced upon him willingly. Despite being unable to swim, he still seeks out life on the ocean to try and be King of the Pirates. His competitive nature would likely drive him to want to beat his best friends in a friendly racing match. @redbeanp13’s vision of a One Piece cart race is highly amusing, featuring a thrilling new adventure for the Straw Hat Pirates that has yet to be realized in any official form, despite how fun it could be with this pirate crew.

One Piece can be streamed now on Netflix!
