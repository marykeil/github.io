The third part of Bleach&#39;s new anime was announced shortly after the end of part 2, so fans were eagerly waiting for a first tease of what&#39;s to come.




The first trailer for Thousand-Year Blood War part 3 was released during Jump Festa 2024, which as always gave fans plenty of exciting news about their favorite series. Even with a packed lineup that inlcuded some of the most popular series of all time, Bleach managed to stand out.

                  Bleach Anime Director Makes Controversial AI Statements At The Worst Possible Time   Anime production and AI have been two highly controversial topics in recent years, and recent comments from Bleach&#39;s director have fed into both.   


 The Conclusion Of Bleach&#39;s Epic War Arc Will Headline 2024 
          




The second part of Thousand-Year Blood War ended with a nail-biting cliffhanger of the highly awaited fight between the Quincy Emperor Yhwach and Ichibe. The trailer for part 3 shows that the next season will kick off with the battle between the two legendary warriors, while Ichigo, Yoruichi, Chad, and Orihime race to the Soul King Palace to face Yhwach and put a stop to his plan of killing the Soul King. Uryu also isn&#39;t defeated yet, with him taking on Sentomaru after being damaged by her Bankai.

There are many other bombshells in the trailer, most notably the return of Aizen, the series&#39; most beloved villain. Branded as one of the 5 Special War Threats by Yhwach, alongside Ichigo, Kenpachi, Ichibe, and Urahara, Aizen has declined Yhwach&#39;s invitation to ally with him, and it seems the master manipulator had his plans. Other characters momentarily appear, such as Grimmjow and Nelliel. This upcoming season will bring back many old characters and introduce new ones as the fight for survival reaches its climax.




In an event filled with the biggest announcements in recent years such as the One Piece remake by Wit Studios and a new Chainsaw Man movie, Bleach managed to stand out and was trending on X (formerly Twitter). This shows that this series will always be relevant, given how iconic it is. The third part of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is on its way, and from the look of the trailer it seems it will keep up the quality of its previous seasons, making it one of the most anticipated anime of 2024.
