## Literature Review

Lorna Dane has always been her father&#39;s daughter, but now she&#39;s taking it to a new level as Polaris equips her own Magneto helmet to protect mutants. 




The X-Men lost one of their biggest champions and protectors with Magneto&#39;s passing, but now his daughter, Polaris, is stepping up in a major way to take his place. In the ongoing Fall of X event, Earth&#39;s mutants are running out of time as their population dwindles to nothing. Lorna Dane has been largely absent as she&#39;s mourned her late father, but now she is returning in a major way - with Knowhere behind her and Orchis locked in her sights.




Marvel&#39;s Fall of the House of X #2 offers the remaining mutants a chance to take the fight straight to Orchis. It marks the return of the absent Polaris, and she is not coming alone. Orchis&#39; war cost Magneto his life, and while he gladly gave it for a chance to protect his people one last time, his daughter clearly has vengeance in mind.

 Fall of the House of X #2 (2024)                 Release Date:  February 14, 2024    Writers:  Gerry Duggan    Artists:  Lucas Werneck    Cover Artist:  Pepe Larraz    Variant Covers:  Ben Harvey, Emilio Laiso, Carlos Gomez, and Giuseppe Camuncoli   NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT! The X-Men may be at their lowest spot, and they may be on the brink of complete eradicationâ€¦but they are not going down without a fight! Polaris returns to guide the X-Men home, bringing a wicked surprise for Orchis! This epic tale split in two continues as the Krakoan Age nears its conclusion!   



The stunning cover by Pepe Larraz shows Lorna in a new costume and helmet that can&#39;t be mistaken as anything but a tribute to the Master of Magnetism. Although Magneto&#39;s resurrection is imminent, that doesn&#39;t lessen the gesture, and it&#39;s unlikely to still Lorna&#39;s hand as she&#39;s shown destroying an Orchis station with the remains of Knowhere.





 Polaris Echoes Magneto&#39;s Power and Perseverance 


          

Magneto is one of the biggest presences in mutant history. He was the founder of nations and shouldered an immense number of tragedies before his death. Max passed on much of what he was, including his incredible powers of magnetism, to Polaris. She survived the massacre of Genosha, and acted as her father&#39;s voice even after his presumed death. As traumatized as she was, Lorna pulled her father&#39;s last words amid Genosha&#39;s final moments from radio signals, broadcasting them in New X-Men #132, by Grant Morrison, Phil Jimenez, Chris Chuckry, and Phil Betancourt. When her father could no longer speak, she did it for him, and she is doing much the same now as the X-Men take the fight to Orchis.

Orchis has played a long game to eliminate mutantkind. They&#39;ve attempted to destroy them from the inside out, even making their biggest strike during a moment of celebration. Establishing Krakoa and its many branches put mutants on top of the world, giving them more power and control than they&#39;d ever enjoyed, yet Orchis brought them to their knees once again. The mutants limp forward with a fraction of their numbers. But Polaris, like her father, seems to unlock new reserves of power when backed into a corner, and she shares in his fury. Lorna is seen smiling in FoX #2 as she deflects Orchis&#39; bullets, giving the impression that she is prepared to unleash everything she has - and there is no chance they&#39;re ready to face it.






 Orchis is Not Ready for the X-Men to Organize Again 


          

The X-Men have been scattered, forced to put their efforts toward finding each other and organizing new footholds against Orchis. Now, they have. As Polaris sends the remains of Knowhere careening toward the Orchis station, Wolverine, Emma Frost, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and others put all of their power toward a goal that every mutant is familiar with: survival. With Lorna&#39;s&#39; father Magneto slated to make his return, the combined might of the Master and Mistress of Magnetism could be the ultimate tipping point. Orchis struck a heavy blow against mutantkind, but now it must face the wrath of the X-Men and Magneto&#39;s heir, Polaris.

Fall of the House of X #2 will be released on February 14 by Marvel Comics.
