# How to Watch Pokémon s Anime Online


## SUMMARY 



  Streaming the entire Pokémon anime series is challenging due to rights and licensing issues, with portions available on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Pokémon TV.   Netflix is the home for new Pokémon episodes and also offers the original series, recent seasons, a special miniseries, and two movies.   Hulu hosts the sixth generation series Pokémon XY and its related parts, but important specials are missing. Amazon Prime has a mix of seasons available for free or purchase, and Pokémon TV offers free streaming with no ads and rotating series.

## Literature Review

Unlike most series, the Pokémon anime is surprisingly difficult to watch online. Here&#39;s how to find what series are streaming on what platform.




Streaming has made it pretty easy to watch anime these days, but the Pokémon anime is an unfortunate exception to this rule. Due to a complicated mess of rights and licensing, the Pokémon anime is currently scattered across several different streaming services, making it difficult to watch the entire series, and some series aren&#39;t streaming at all at present.




Because of this, fans who want to revisit the series for nostalgia, or even new viewers, can have a hard time finding what they want to watch. At present, portions of the series are available across Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, as well as Pokémon&#39;s own streaming channel, Pokémon TV, but nowhere has the entire series. This guide will walk through what series are presently available where, as well as which series can&#39;t be found streaming online. It is primarily oriented towards those in the US, but some of this information will apply to other regions as well.


 What Pokémon Series are Streaming on Netflix? 
          

Netflix is the current home for new Pokémon episode releases. Fans with a Netflix subscription can watch the original series (referred to as &#34;Pokémon: Indigo League&#34; on Netflix) which includes the first 52 episodes. Also available are Pokémon Journeys, Pokémon Master Journeys, Pokémon Ultimate Journeys, and Pokémon: to Be a Pokémon Master, the four most recent seasons of the Pokémon anime depicting Ash&#39;s ascent to the top. Netflix also currently hosts the special miniseries The Arceus Chronicles, as well as the last two movies, Pokémon: Secrets of the Jungle and Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution, the CGI remake of the first movie. Finally, Netflix will be the US streaming home for Pokémon Horizons, starting in February 2024.






 What Pokémon Series are Streaming on Hulu? 
          

Hulu currently hosts the sixth generation anime, Pokémon XY. The series is split into three parts which are listed separately on the service: Pokémon XY, Pokémon XY: Kalos Quest, and Pokémon XYZ. Pokémon XY is often hailed as a high point for the anime, taking a more shonen-style approach to Ash Ketchum&#39;s quest to be the best, adding more action. Pokémon XY is also where the popular mechanic of Mega Evolution features most heavily, giving fans yet another reason to check this series out. Unfortunately, Pokémon XY&#39;s related specials, known as the Mega Evolution specials, are not available on Hulu or anywhere else, meaning some important background information is missing for the final arc.



 What Pokémon Series are Streaming on Amazon Prime? 
          




Amazon Prime has an eclectic mix of series available, with some free with Prime, while others must be purchased by episode or by season. All three seasons of Pokémon Gold and Silver are available on Amazon Prime. Ruby and Sapphire has what&#39;s listed as season 7 (the second Ruby and Sapphire season) available, while Pokémon XY and XYZ are available, but not the intermediate Kalos Quest. Not every season is available, but many, such as Sun &amp; Moon and Diamond &amp; Pearl, can be viewed at a pay-per-episode/season price, usually at $1-2 per episode. There is also the Pokémon Channel add-on which can be purchased, and includes some of these seasons. Most of the Pokémon movies are also available to buy or rent on Amazon.



 What Pokémon Series are Streaming on Pokémon TV? 
          

The Pokémon Company also has its own streaming platform, Pokémon TV, which does have an app as well as a website where videos can be watched. At present, Pokémon TV has all three seasons of Journeys, as well as all 3 seasons of Sun &amp; Moon, and the first two seasons (known here as &#34;Pokémon: The Beginning&#34;). Additionally, the platform rotates two other series in and out on a monthly basis, which, at the time of writing, are the first two seasons of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. The service also puts together packages of themed episodes that it releases, such as episodes which star Legendary Pokémon, or episodes where a certain character appears.




Pokémon TV is completely free and features no ads, making it very worthwhile for Pokémon fans to have access to it. The website also features text summaries and images of every episode, including those which aren&#39;t currently available on the service, offering fans some solace when the episode they&#39;re looking for is unavailable. The service also includes some special series that have run in the past, such as Pokémon Generations, and content for extremely young children, known as Pokémon Kids TV. For those who are patient, any given season will be available on Pokémon TV eventually, though it may take a while to cycle through.



The Pokémon TV App is available on Roku, Nintendo Switch, Apple TV, Fire TV, and other Android-compatible streaming devices.






 What About the Rest of the Pokémon Anime? 
          




As noted above, even across all four of these streaming platforms, it&#39;s not possible to watch every episode of the series. Diamond and Pearl and Black &amp; White have suffered the most, as neither series is available even partially on any of the aforementioned platforms at present (barring Amazon&#39;s individual episode purchases). The three most recent series (XY, Sun &amp; Moon, and Journeys) are all easily available, on the other hand, and each one is a perfectly appropriate starting point for a new fan, as it&#39;s not usually necessary to watch a previous series before starting a new one.

It&#39;s hard to understand why the Pokémon Company would make it so difficult for fans to watch their content, and it&#39;s a bit of a mystery as to how this complex streaming situation developed. Given how long the Pokémon anime is, it&#39;s possible that no company wanted to shell out for the rights to all 25 seasons, and instead chose specific series to focus on. What is available has changed with time as well; Netflix once had Sun &amp; Moon, for example, but it was removed over a year ago. It seems there&#39;s not likely to be a resolution to this situation any time soon, so Pokémon fans will simply have to deal with the series streaming in part on multiple platforms.




               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
