## Literature Review

The Netflix Original anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, stole the spotlight in 2022 and now, a cosplay of Lucy Kushinada brings the hacker to life!




A new cosplay has brought Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to life. Shared by linlavcosplay on Reddit, the look is absolutely impressive and shows how incredible the character could look in reality. The fan-favorite netrunner is ready to hack any necessary system and tackle any foe that happens to cross her path.




Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is an anime series inspired by the video game Cyberpunk 2077. It spanned ten episodes after its release in September 2022. Lucyna Kushinada, better known as Lucy, works with a team of edgerunners, who serve as her found family. The series followed David Martinez, who joined the team and developed a relationship with Lucy.


 

Produced by Studio Trigger, the series was awarded Best Anime Series by IGN Awards in 2022, Anime of the Year and Best Voice Artist Performance at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in 2023, and Best Anime, Best Director, and Best Action Anime at the Japan Expo Awards in 2023.

This cosplay from linlavcosplay on Reddit perfectly captures Lucy’s appearance and a big part of her role in the series. The photo features an electronic display showing her remaining hacking time to breach a network, providing a look at her cybernetic viewpoint. The hair, makeup, and outfit are all readily recognizable and well-executed, making this an especially incredible cosplay. Lucy is becoming an increasingly popular character to cosplay and thus far, cosplayers have shown that they are up to the challenge. Linlavcosplay is no exception with her faithful rendition of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners’ show-stealing hacker.

Though Lucy may not be the main character of the hit anime, she frequently steals the spotlight with her charm and impact on David’s life. Her skills are also nothing to laugh at, having been a top trainee under the tutelage of Arasaka, making her group’s crusade against the megacorporation personal, as well as extra dangerous. Lucy’s mysterious and somewhat dark background also helps to add sympathy to her character. She rose above the challenges in front of her and still managed to find love in a city she views as a prison she needs to escape from.
