## Literature Review

One Piece has finally revealed the terrifying Devil Fruit powers of one of the Five Elders, and the series may never be the same again.





Chapter #1094 of One Piece reveals Saint Saturn has landed on Egghead Island, emerging from a pentagram-like magic circle with a giant, monstrous half-spider lower body and ox-like horns. Saturn also sports the characteristic floating smoke sash typically associated with awakened Zoan-type Devil Fruits. Considering his menacing size and appearance as well as the supernatural devil-like horns on his head and pentagram he created, Saturn&#39;s Fruit is most likely a Mythical Zoan.




                  One Piece Teases That Its Biggest Villains Are Not Human   One Piece&#39;s chapter #1090 drops a huge hint that its ultimate villains, the Five Elders, are not from the series&#39; world, or at least not human.   


 Saint Saturn Possesses the Power of a Mythical Zoan 
          

While the formidable attack against Sabo and King Cobra in Chapter #1085 did tease that the Gorosei have much more to them than their political prowess, the true forms and capabilities of the Five Elders remained veiled in shadows leaving fans to speculate about their Devil Fruits. However, with Saint Saturn&#39;s arrival on Egghead Island, it seems there may no longer be any need for speculation. It&#39;s pretty safe to assume that each of the Five Elders has an awakened Mythical Zoan, what is left to discover is which legendary creatures these borrow their powers from.




Most notably, Saint Saturn&#39;s appearance bears a striking resemblance to an ancient Japanese demon called the ushi-oni which is a cross between an ox and a spider with similar horns and spider legs as Saturn. If Saturn&#39;s Devil Fruit is truly based on the ushi-oni, fans can expect some truly terrifying powers from him including the ability to spit poison which may explain how he was able to instantly blow off the head of a Marine who met his gaze against order in the chapter. Nonetheless, Saint Saturn&#39;s horrifying powers suggest the rest of the Five Elders&#39; Devil Fruits may be just as monstrous, if not more. Mhtycal Zoans are, after all, the rarest Devil Fruits, known for conferring incredible powers to their users, including some of the series&#39; strongest characters such as Kaido and Luffy himself.



 The Five Elders Just Changed The Hierarchy Of Power In One Piece 
          




While One Piece is yet to reveal what Saturn&#39;s Devil fruit truly is, this massive reveal recontextualizes how the Final War may play. With the massive power boost that Luffy and Straw Hats got after their battles in Wano, it seemed that they would have a hard time finding worthy opponents. However, the incredible reveal of Saint Jaygarcia Saturn&#39;s true Devil Fruit form upsets the series&#39; power scaling completely, making the Five Elders could be the next big obstacle that Luffy and the Straw Hats will have to overcome in One Piece​​​​​​.

One Piece is available from Viz Media.
