## Literature Review

After a setup episode, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #11 is primed to be an exciting installment that will begin the anime&#39;s next fights.




While episode #10 was largely a setup for the rest of the arc to come, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #11 promises to feature some exciting action scenes and new characters. This will likely kick the incredibly hyped-up Shibuya Incident arc into full gear and start to hint at why manga readers hold it in such high regard. Although based on how shocking the previous episodes were, many fans may already be convinced of the storyline&#39;s greatness.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode #11 Releases 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #11 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, October 5. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 5 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #10? 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #10 followed up on the shocking ending of episode #9 in which the sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body managed to seal Gojo in the prison realm. Luckily Mechamaru&#39;s contingency plan went into effect once this happened, enabling him to alert Yuji and by extension the other sorcerers on the scene that Gojo was out of the picture. In addition, the sheer god-tier power of Gojo overloaded the Prison Realm, making it too heavy for the curses to lift and take out of Shibuya. As a result, the remaining sorcerers and curses are now set up to fight each other in the battle over Gojo&#39;s prison.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #11 Will Feature New Fights And Faces 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #10 set up a variety of potential fights for episode #11 to touch on. Mei Mei is battling the curse down in the tunnels below Shibuya while Mahito, Choso, and Jogo are all looking for Yuji to either kill him or turn him into Sukuna. In addition, three new potential enemies were introduced in the after-credits scene that will likely play a part in episode #11. The sorcerers on the other hand are all inside Shibuya&#39;s veil, mobilized for action and hunting down Gojo&#39;s prison realm, which will likely bring them into direct conflict with the curses. Given the less action-packed nature of episode #10, episode #11 will likely focus on showing these fights or setting them up more directly.

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2&#39;s previous fights have already been superb so if episode #11 lives up to that standard then it will also be great. Of course, even the less fight-oriented episode #10 managed to be quite entertaining which means that even if episode #11 is just more set up for future fights it will still probably be incredibly good. It is a sign of how well Studio MAPPA has done so far in bringing Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 to screen that no matter what episode #11 focuses on it is almost guaranteed to be entertaining and compelling.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #11 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 5, 2023.
