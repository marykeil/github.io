Warning! This article contains spoilers for Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong #4 The rivalry between Godzilla and King Kong is one that stretches through numerous continuities, including two separate film franchises, novels, and even comic books. But every time, their rivalry was always missing that one, seemingly unidentifiable ‘something’ that really would have made their ‘versus’ events pop. And now, thanks to Godzilla’s new nickname during the two Titans’ latest crossover conflict, that shortcoming has effectively been corrected.




In a preview for Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong #4 by Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce, the Justice League are reeling after their devastating loss to Godzilla in the previous issue. At the start of this series, the Titans from the MonsterVerse were transported to the DC Universe, and the Justice League wasted no time taking them down. While Batman, Wonder Woman and the rest were successful in defeating some of the lesser kaiju spread across the world, Godzilla himself was another story, as Superman was brought to the brink of death after being hit by Godzilla’s atomic breath.

          

          




          

          

          

The preview opened with the Justice League at the Fortress of Solitude, where Superman is recovering from his near-death experience with Godzilla. It’s then that the League learns exactly how these monsters breached their reality, and they create a game plan for sending them all back. While talking about the known positions of each Titan, Cyborg refers to Godzilla as ‘the Metropolis Monster’, as that was where he attacked first. While that name is fitting, especially since the Justice League couldn’t have known that he’s actually called ‘Godzilla’, there are a few other reasons why that’s an absolutely perfect moniker.

Here are the 10 deadliest! (Besides Kong).   


 Godzilla Called the Metropolis Monster Is Fitting For His Conflict With Superman 
The monster believes Superman poses a global threat because he&#39;s not from Earth.
          

While he may seem like it, MonsterVerse fans know that Godzilla is not a mindless monster who will obliterate a city for no reason. Sure, some iterations of Godzilla might do that, but not the one who crossed over into DC canon. So, why did Godzilla invade Metropolis, of all places, with the single-minded goal of killing Superman? The answer is actually deceptively simple: Godzilla is trying to protect the Earth from Superman.




Godzilla is a being whose very essence is connected with the Earth, as the entire planet is almost like an extension of his nervous system. Unlike other depictions of Godzilla (like Godzilla Minus One), the MonsterVerse version is a metaphor for nature and the natural order, rather than nuclear destruction. And Superman is not a part of Earth’s natural order. Superman’s an alien with world-ending potential, and Godzilla can literally feel that, so he has made efforts to protect his planet from this ‘invading force’. Since Godzilla’s entire mission in this crossover is to kill Superman, the nickname ‘Metropolis Monster’ is perfectly fitting.



 “King Kong vs the Metropolis Monster”: Godzilla’s New Nickname Creates Matching Alliteration 
It sounds better and more threatening
         

‘King Kong vs Godzilla’, or even the more recent ‘Godzilla vs Kong’ has always been a clunky title, and makes it seem like these are two franchises that are coming together for a crossover as opposed to a single monster-movie event. These two Titans aren’t two separate entities anymore in any sense of the word; they are a singular franchise that deserves a more snappy title. With Godzilla being nicknamed ‘the Metropolis Monster’, the title of their monster movie would feel a bit more cohesive and snappy — and it’s all thanks to the power of alliteration.






Godzilla vs. Kong is available to stream on both Hulu and Max. Its sequel, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, will release on March 29, 2024.




Godzilla’s alternate moniker gives a better-sounding title to the Titan’s legendary rivalry with King Kong while simultaneously cementing Godzilla as a very serious enemy of and threat to Superman himself, making ‘the Metropolis Monster’ an undeniably awesome new nickname for Godzilla.

Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong #4 by DC Comics was released on January 16, 2024.
