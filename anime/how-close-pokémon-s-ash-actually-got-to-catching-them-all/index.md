# How Close Pokémon s Ash Actually Got To Catching Them All


## SUMMARY 



  Ash only caught 57 unique Pokémon, a mere 7% of the total available.   Including evolutions, Ash owned a more respectable 12% of Pokémon.   The goal of becoming a Pokémon Master for Ash was about befriending all Pokémon, not catching them all.

## Literature Review

With Ash&#39;s era of the Pokémon anime over and done, just how many Pokémon did Ash have by the end, and was it even remotely close to catching them all?




Everyone knows Pokémon&#39;s long-standing motto, &#34;gotta catch &#39;em all,&#34; but when it comes to the anime, one can&#39;t help but wonder, now that Ash&#39;s journey is over, just how close the former protagonist actually got to catching them all. Ash caught a lot of Pokémon during his journey, but unfortunately, he never came close to catching every single one.




By the time Ash&#39;s era ended, there were over 1,000 Pokémon known to exist. Ash never visited Paldea, however, so it feels unfair to count those against him. Between all the regions Ash actually visited, there were 898 different species of Pokémon that he could&#39;ve caught.

          

If one removes the 80 Legendary and Mythical Pokémon (excluding Meltan/Melmetal), which are often portrayed as uncatchable in the anime, that leaves 818 Pokémon that Ash could have potentially caught.


 Ash Only Owned 105 Unique Pokémon During His Adventure 
         

In reality, though, Ash only caught 57 unique individual Pokémon over the course of the series, roughly 7% of the Pokémon available to him. Of course, that isn&#39;t quite the whole story. If one considers evolutions, then Ash has owned 98 Pokémon throughout the series, a more respectable 12%. There are also some murkier situations to consider, such as the Raticate Ash owned for all of 15 minutes, or the Rotom from his Rotom Pokédex. That still only gets him an extra 7, though, bringing the total to 105. Goh did a better job than Ash, despite being only introduced in Journeys, and he managed to catch 108 Pokémon in just a few years, including Legendary Pokémon, and with evolutions considered, he tops out at 116.




                  Ash&#39;s 10 Rarest Pokémon   Ash Ketchum owned a wide variety of Pokémon by the end of his series, but which Pokémon that he caught were the absolute rarest of all?   

Ash&#39;s aim was to become a Pokémon Master, a vaguely defined goal that many assumed involved catching as many as possible. That has never been Ash&#39;s philosophy, though. From the beginning, he has worked to develop relationships with each of his Pokémon, something he just can&#39;t do if he has too many. Actually catching every Pokémon he encountered would get in the way of the series&#39; messages about friendship and trust, as it treats Pokémon as real, living creatures with their own desires and needs. In the series finale, Ash decides that being a Pokémon Master means having the ability to befriend all Pokémon, not catch them all, and that&#39;s a goal he&#39;s much closer to.



 Ahs&#39;s Goal Is Actually The Opposite Of &#34;Catching Them All&#34; 
          




In the end, Ash didn&#39;t catch every Pokémon, and only barely made it past 10% of all Pokémon. The series wouldn&#39;t be what it is, though, without Ash&#39;s particular brand of training and bonding with Pokémon, and that just wouldn&#39;t be possible if he caught everything in sight. This way, individual Pokémon were allowed to have their own personalities, endearing many species to fans that might not otherwise be so popular. While Ash Ketchum&#39;s Pokémon journey didn&#39;t end with catching them all, it instead ended in a way more fitting to the themes of the series, and that&#39;s probably for the best.
