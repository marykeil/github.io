 10  Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006) 
Original Anime Produced by Sunrise
        

The critically acclaimed Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion follows the story of the titular Lelouch Lamperouge, the exiled prince of Britannia, a dictatorial nation that conquered Japan. Seeking revenge against his father, the Britannian Emperor, he assumes the identity of Zero and uses his newfound “Geass” power to lead a rebellion, hoping to create a better world for his sister. Although the title’s setting is quite different from that of Fullmetal Alchemist, thanks to its mecha twist, they are rather similar in terms of story and underlying concepts, as they both feature military themes and government conspiracies, as well as characters who seek to expose the truth and fight against oppression.

 9  Blue Exorcist (2011) 
Produced by A-1 Pictures and Based on the Manga by Kazue Kato


 







The setting of Blue Exorcist is split into two worlds: Assiah, where humans reside, and Gehenna, which is ruled by Satan, the Demon King. Hoping to conquer Assiah, Satan creates Rin Okumura, but his plans are foiled as Rin instead chooses to become an exorcist alongside his brother, Yukio, and defend the place he considers home. Similarly to Fullmetal Alchemist, this title also prominently features the themes of identity and family, as it revolves around the bond of two unusual brothers who fight together against all odds, overcoming various obstacles along the way.

Produced by Wit Studio and MAPPA and Based on the Manga by Hajime Isayama

However, it gradually grows in scope, revealing itself to be much more complex and unpredictable than anyone could have anticipated. Beyond featuring common themes such as revenge, the military, and corruption, both Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan are recognized as masterpieces for a reason.

However, everything comes together eventually, revealing that the seemingly unrelated events were all part of a complex and thought-provoking tale. Though Baccano! focuses more on the mystery, while Fullmetal Alchemist is more concerned with presenting an adventure, the two are more similar than one may assume, as they both share the same central themes of alchemy and immortality, with homunculi playing an important role in the story. Moreover, neither makes any attempt to hide just how dangerous alchemy can be, showcasing the unintended consequences of seeking immortality.
