## Literature Review

My Hero Academia still has a lot of unresolved plot threads deep into its Final War arc. These are the ten things it needs to do before it ends.





My Hero Academia has a relatively simple premise, following a boy who wants to become the best superhero in the world. However, despite this, the series has grown quite complex over its run, with an ever-expanding cast of characters, each with their own character arcs. This means that the series has a lot to cover in its final arc, which is a giant war involving most of the characters in the series. Some plot threads have been resolved so far, such as wrapping up Ochaco and Toga&#39;s relationship with a tragic death, which provides hope that the events on this list will also be covered soon. Here are the ten things that My Hero Academia needs to cover before it ends.









 








 10  Make Nighteye&#39;s Prediction Come True 
        

Nighteye was a hero with the power of Foresight, which let him see the outcome of things that would happen in the future. He and All Might were initially allies until Nighteye saw a foreboding prediction that All Might would die a terrible death if he continued being a superhero. All Might continued to fight on anyway despite the risk to himself, which Nighteye couldn&#39;t bear to watch. Now with All Might in a final battle with All For One, Night Eye&#39;s prediction may be coming true sooner than fans expected. However, this is a good thing as it finally pays off on this foreshadowing from so long ago.





 9  Explain the Origin of Quirks 
        

There are still a lot of open mysteries concerning the exact nature of Quirks and their origins in My Hero Academia&#39;s world. The official explanation is that Quirks arose as the natural next step in human evolution, but this reasoning has some major holes in it and thus is likely not the entire story. While My Hero Academia hasn&#39;t focused too much on the nitty-gritty details of how Quirks work, it would still be unfortunate if the series ended without fleshing out this majorly important element of its world just a little bit more.





 8  The Fight Against Midnight&#39;s Killer 
        

There are many battles occurring simultaneously in the Final War arc, meaning that the series likely won&#39;t be able to cover all of them in full. But one it absolutely needs to show is the battle between Midnight&#39;s killer and some of the students in Class 1-A. Midnight was unceremoniously killed off-screen in the Paranormal Liberation War arc, which many fans were unsatisfied with. This fight against the villain claiming to be Midnight&#39;s killer could provide the closure that these fans have so desperately wanted. It also would allow Class 1-A to avenge one of their favorite teachers and show how much they have grown.





 7  Have Deku and Ochaco Get Together 
        

Deku and Ochaco both clearly have a crush on each other. They have let these feelings develop for hundreds of chapters without admitting them to the other, leaving many fans anxiously wanting them to get together. Many Shonen series are infamous for mishandling their romance aspects, so My Hero Academia may not resolve their budding romance satisfyingly, but this is still something that the series needs to address before it ends. If it doesn&#39;t, then this entire subplot of Deku and Ochaco loving each other will have been a pointless inclusion that served only to cruelly get fans excited over nothing.





 6  Reveal Bakugo&#39;s Fate 
        

The last My Hero Academia showed of Bakugo he was on the brink of death after damaging his heart with his Quirk. Edgeshot was attempting to enact a desperate plan to save the young hero, potentially at the cost of his own life, but it was unclear whether this would work. This moment was controversial for many fans, with some loving the potential franchise-shattering death for how it subverted expectations and others hating it for being too rushed and missing some perfect opportunities for a more emotionally resonant result. But regardless of how fans felt about this moment, with Bakugo being such a popular character, My Hero Academia needs to reveal if he lives or dies in this final battle.





 5  Resolve the Todoroki Family Drama 
        

Despite being a top Hero, Endeavor was an abusive father whose behavior splintered his family and turned his oldest son into the self-destructive supervillain Dabi. In the Final War, Shoto attempted to confront Dabi and stop his rampage, but ultimately this wasn&#39;t enough as Dabi returned to prolong the Todoroki family drama. The entire Todoroki family then joined together to try and stop him, which seems like it may have worked, although the manga is somewhat ambiguous on that point. Given how important the Todoroki family drama has become to the series, My Hero Academia can&#39;t let it end on such an open-ended note and thus must revisit it before its finale.





 4  Restore Order to Japan 
        

After the Paranormal Liberation War and the release of a myriad of powerful villains from the Tartarus prison, Japan became a sort of dystopia with ordinary citizens scared to even go outside alone. This also coincided with many pro heroes retiring, only exacerbating the problems. With the heroes all fighting to defeat the League of Villains once and for all, the end of the Final War arc will be the perfect chance to restore order to the country. While this likely won&#39;t be an instantaneous change, as the level of devastation the country is currently suffering through can be hard to bounce back from, it is a necessary one to give the series a satisfying ending.





 3  Reveal the Narrator 
        

At the very beginning of the series, a narrator states that this is the story of how they became the greatest hero. While it is most likely that this narrator is an older version of Deku recounting his rise as a hero, some fans have theorized that My Hero Academia&#39;s narrator could actually be Bakugo. Regardless of who the narrator actually is, fans need to actually see them as the greatest Hero in the pages of the story itself or else the narrator&#39;s words will lose all credibility. It will also likely provide a satisfying end to the narrator&#39;s character arc, showing how they actually grew to become the best hero in the series.





 2  Class 1-A&#39;s Graduation 
        

With all the intense battles going on in the Final War arc, it can be tough to remember that most of My Hero Academia&#39;s main protagonists are still in high school. While My Hero Academia would have been much better if it had paced the events of the story better and had this Final War occur around the end of their senior year, Class 1-A being in school is still an important thing to consider given that even after this conflict concludes they still won&#39;t be able to immediately become professional heroes. Thus, their graduation is a necessary part of the series in order to allow them to become fully-fledged adult heroes and to show what the next generation can truly do.





 1  Resolve Deku and Shigaraki&#39;s Conflict 
        

One of the most important battles in the series is between Deku and Shigaraki, the successors of One For All and All For One respectively. This battle is currently occurring in the manga, even if it isn&#39;t receiving much attention on the page right now. But it has been foreshadowed that this battle may not end with a typical defeat, as Deku has expressed the desire to attempt to reform Shigaraki in the past. Whether this clash ends in violence or newfound friendship, it is a fight that has been built up since the series began and thus needs to actually conclude instead of ending with a tease of future fighting to come.
There are many more plot threads and questions that My Hero Academia will hopefully touch on before the series ends, but these are the most important. Horikoshi has expressed a strong desire to finish the series soon, which could unfortunately cause some of these plot threads to get rushed or dropped entirely. This would unfortunately likely make My Hero Academia&#39;s ending a fair bit worse, so hopefully all these points are touched on in a satisfactory manner before the series wraps up for good.
