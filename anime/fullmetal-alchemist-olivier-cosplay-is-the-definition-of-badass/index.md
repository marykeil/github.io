 Fullmetal Alchemist&#39;s Olivier Cosplay Brings to Life A Beloved Character 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is based on the original manga by Hiromu Arakawa
          




A member of the aristocratic Armstrong family, Olivier Mira Armstrong is the eldest of five siblings and a Major General stationed at Ametris&#39; northern border. Despite her relation to Major Alex Louis Armstrong, her serious demeanor is drastically different from his comical persona. While she plays a crucial role in Hiromu Arakawa&#39;s original manga, her character is omitted from the 2003 adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist. In this version of the anime, Alex is the eldest in his family and has only one younger sibling. However, Olivier appears in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as a major supporting character, and an ally to the Elrics.

                  10 Best Anime Remakes &amp; Reboots   Some of the best adaptations of anime and manga are reboots and remakes, as seen with the success of Trigun Stampede and Hunter x Hunter.   

ValendraVenus&#39; expression perfectly captures Olivier&#39;s ruthless persona and reminds fans why they love the Ice Queen. Fullmetal Alchemist is known for multi-layered characters like the Major General, whose harsh words mask her selfless and just nature. When the Elrics arrive at Fort Briggs with a letter from her brother, Olivier tears it up, saying she prefers to judge people with her own eyes. Considering them worthy comrades, she supports the two boys during their time in the North and helps them learn about the military&#39;s true intentions. Olivier further demonstrates her caring nature when she tells her family to leave Amestris to prevent them from becoming hostages in the future.




Due to its popularity, Fullmetal Alchemist has received two anime adaptations. The 2003 series, while based on Arakawa&#39;s magnum opus, caught up to the manga and diverged from the source material halfway through the anime. In 2009, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was released as a more faithful adaptation that followed the creator&#39;s intended story and ending. Both versions of the anime are well-received, but the latter remains acclaimed as one of the highest-rated anime series. Despite the story having concluded years ago, ValendraVenus&#39;s cosplay proves that Fullmetal Alchemist will continue to live on in the hearts of fans.
