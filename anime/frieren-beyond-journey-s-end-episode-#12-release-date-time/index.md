## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #12 will show what lies beyond the northern mountains and potentially begin the next arc of the series.




After a relatively calm episode #11, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #12 will likely feature the main characters encountering a new location with new people to meet. This could either initiate the start of a new arc or be a more episodic installment like those in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s excellent premiere. Either way, episode #12 is sure to be just as beautiful as the ones that came before it.

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #11? 
          




Taking place immediately after Frieren&#39;s victory over Aura, episode #11 began by covering the aftermath of that battle. Frieren and her friends were thanked by Graf Granat and warned that they would need to have a certified level 1 mage in their party if they wanted to travel freely in the north. On their way to the city where Frieren could receive that certification, winter began and the trio had to hole up in a cabin for the season. There they met the Elf Kraft who was different from Frieren in many ways, despite sharing Frieren&#39;s effective immortality. When winter passed the new elf left and the party continued north.



Kraft is implied to have been important in the past.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #12 Will Show What the North is Like 
          




After spending a whole winter in a cabin, Frieren and her gang likely won&#39;t have much difficulty crossing the mountain pass and reaching the next town on their journey. Given it will be closer to the stronghold of the Demon King, this town may be threatened by some of Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s fascinating villains just like Granat&#39;s domain to the south was. This could lead to another multi-episode arc where Frieren, Fern, and Stark defeat some powerful demons. However, it could just as easily return to an episodic format like its initial episodes.

This uncertainty around what the next episode&#39;s plot will be is part of what makes the show so enchanting. It treats both epic battles and simple parts of life with the same level of care, which makes it unpredictable but satisfying. Hopefully, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #12 will continue this trend and provide fans with a beautiful surprise.

Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #12 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 24, 2023.
