# My Hero Academia Has Its Own Version of One-Punch Man


## SUMMARY 



  In My Hero Academia: Team-Up Missions Chapter #20, the pro hero Blackbelt resembles One-Punch Man&#39;s Saitama in terms of feeling underappreciated despite his rapid takedowns of enemies.   The trio of Momo, Kaminari, and Hatsume try to help Blackbelt gain recognition for his efforts, eventually capturing his speed on a high-speed drone camera and showing the public how impressive he really is.   Despite Blackbelt&#39;s desire for popularity and his use of affectations, he has been a hero for 10 years in obscurity, indicating that fame isn&#39;t his only concern.

## Literature Review

My Hero Academia: Team-Up Missions introduces a hero who&#39;s under-recognized and can defeat any enemy in a single attack, just like Saitama.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia: Team-Up Missions Chapter #20My Hero Academia isn&#39;t the only superhero manga out there, and its spinoff series Team-Up Missions decided to take its own crack at fellow series One-Punch Man with one pro hero who closely resembles Saitama, at least in terms of character.




My Hero Academia: Team-Up Missions are small side-stories that usually center on a handful of characters, in this case Momo, Kaminari, and Hatsume, often working together with a pro, or training. In chapter #20 of Team-Up Missions, the trio are sent out to meet a pro hero who specializes in martial arts known as Blackbelt. When they arrive, they find that Blackbelt is rather down and considering retiring from hero work.

          

He&#39;s been a hero for 10 years, but he has basically no fans because his victories aren&#39;t all that flashy; in fact, he tends to take out enemies with a single attack.


 Blackbelt is MHA&#39;s Take on Saitama 
          




Physically, Blackbelt doesn&#39;t much resemble Saitama, as for starters, he has quite a lot of hair. However, his characterization greatly resembles Saitama, who similarly feels underappreciated, and whose rapid take-downs of monsters and villains often get dismissed because of their apparent ease. In Blackbelt&#39;s case, it&#39;s because of his Quirk, known as Fast Fist, which actually allows him to strike an opponent so rapidly that a hundred blows look, to an outside observer, to be only a single hit. He&#39;s known facetiously online as &#34;Hundo-hit Man,&#34; an obvious reference to One-Punch Man. Blackbelt uses his knowledge of pressure points to attack specific areas, and the sheer number of hits basically guarantee a strike to the pressure point, knocking a bad guy out instantly.

The three students decide they want to help Blackbelt be recognized for his efforts and try a variety of things, most of which don&#39;t work too well. As a last resort, they agree to make a drone that can capture Blackbelt&#39;s final act of heroics before he retires. Hatsume employs a high-speed camera in the drone, however, and is able to capture the speed at which Blackbelt attacks for the public, allowing them to finally see how impressive he really is. Enjoying a surge in popularity, Blackbelt decides to stay in the hero game a little longer, and the kids rejoice that their plan to help was a success.




Ironically, Saitama probably wouldn&#39;t like Blackbelt very much, as he puts on affectations such as strange manners of speech to try to find a gimmick that the public enjoys. While Saitama has often turned down public attention, instead directing it at other heroes (such as the battle with Deep Sea King), Blackbelt seems very concerned with his popularity. Despite that, though, Blackbelt did perform hero work for 10 years, so he couldn&#39;t have been exclusively concerned with fame. My Hero Academia&#39;s version of One-Punch Man&#39;s hero is lucky to have finally found a way to be properly appreciated, as that&#39;s something that Saitama still hasn&#39;t quite found for himself even nearly 200 chapters in.
