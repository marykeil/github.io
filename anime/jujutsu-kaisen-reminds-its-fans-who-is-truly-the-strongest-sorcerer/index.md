## Literature Review

Fulfilling a promise he made to his former mentor, Yuta Okkotsu flawlessly takes down Kenjaku, reminding everyone who is the strongest sorcerer.




Warning: This article contains SPOILERS from Jujutsu Kaisen #243Yuta Okkotsu was considered the most promising sorcerer at the beginning of Jujutsu Kaisen, and he was actually the first protagonist of the story, but then he literally disappeared, sidelined by the emergence of Megumi Fushiguro, Yuji Itadori, and Nobara Kugisaki. His absence lasted so long that even when he briefly reappeared later in the story, he barely seemed relevant to those who remembered him. However, now Yuta is back, and he immediately reminds everyone why he is considered one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world.




In chapter #243 of Jujutsu Kaisen, the series&#39; true villain mastermind Kenjaku makes a fatal mistake. He lets himself get so engrossed in the surreal battle against Takaba that he lowers his guard, which allows Yuta to take him out in one single strike.

          

It&#39;s true that this gambit could only be set up thanks to Takaba&#39;s cursed technique, but the fact that Yuta delivered the killing blow to Kenjaku means that, perhaps, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s original protagonist is back into the spotlight, and not a second too soon. After Gojo&#39;s death, the sorcerers have lost their main asset, and the only one who can truly replace Gojo is, indeed, his most promising pupil, Yuta.


 Yuta Proves That He Is Now The Most Powerful Sorcerer In Jujutsu Kaisen 
         




Contrary to popular belief, Jujutsu Kaisen did not begin with the famous story of Yuji swallowing Sukuna&#39;s finger. In fact, it began as a limited series focused on Yuta Okkotsu. That story, entitled &#34;Cursed Child&#34;, which was later republished as Chapter 0 in Jujutsu Kaisen manga and adapted into the Sunghoo Park film Jujutsu Kaisen 0: The Movie, was so well received that its creator Gege Akutami and publisher Shueisha decided to expand the story out into the ongoing series.

That original story ended with Yuta clearly being on schedule to become the most powerful sorcerer the world has seen in a long time - a development even Gojo acknowledged. But then came the new series, focused on new characters, and it immediately took off in popularity, meaning Yuta ended up becoming a background character. With the abrupt death of Gojo, as the last surviving Special Grade Sorcerer of this era, even if Yuta wanted to remain in the background, the circumstances simply would not let him. As he demonstrated in Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter #243, his power and abilities are second to none - especially now that he&#39;s resolved his Rika issues.




          

Indeed, Yuta&#39;s elimination of Kenjaku is spectacular on many levels. While the confrontation only lasted for a moment, it spoke volumes about Yuta&#39;s abilities. While he was able to get the jump on Kenjaku, the villain was nevertheless able to use his &#34;cursed technique reversal: anti-gravity&#34;. This is an extremely powerful spell that, in essence, subjects the victim to extreme gravity force. However, Yuta was both quick enough to escape its full effects and strong enough to chop off Kenjaku&#39;s head with one swing.



Kenjaku acquired the original anti-gravity cursed technique through his possession of Yuji&#39;s mother, Kaori Itadori. It was her innate technique. He can reverse its effect as a result of his mastery of the reverse cursed technique.







The confrontation also revealed Yuta&#39;s deep understanding of how sorcery works. In his attack, he aimed for the enemy&#39;s head because he knew that, with Kenjaku&#39;s mastery of reverse cursed technique, the only way to kill him instantaneously was to sever the head from the body. It will be interesting to see if author Gege Akutami will truly go back to his initial story and give Yuta Okkotsu a prominent role, but for now, his quick defeat of Kenjaku proves that Yuta is truly Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s new strongest sorcerer.
