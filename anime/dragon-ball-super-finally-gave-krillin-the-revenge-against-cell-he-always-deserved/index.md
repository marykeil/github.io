## Literature Review

Krillin gets the chance to redeem himself for his earlier failures with Cell in DBZ by using a particular move against Cell Max in Dragon Ball Super.




Warning: Spoilers for Dragon Ball Super chapter #98Krillin&#39;s ability to use a specific technique on Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Cell Max has finally given him the revenge he desperately needed against DBZ&#39;s original Cell who bested him numerous times with the same move. Although Cell Max is just an improved variation of his namesake rather than being the actual original, it&#39;s impossible to ignore the connection based on just how embarrassing Krillin&#39;s run-ins with the original Cell were.




In Dragon Ball Z, Imperfect Cell first uses Solar Flare on Krillin to escape from him, Piccolo and Trunks, allowing the villain to become stronger and more of a threat. Later, a now Semi-Perfect Cell absorbs Android 18 and subsequently becomes Perfect Cell after successfully blinding Krillin again the same way.

          

Irrespective of the fact that Krillin could have eliminated the effect of Cell&#39;s Solar Flare, Krillin never had a chance to get back at Cell with his own version of the technique, which quickly became one of his signature moves.


 Krillin Successfully Blinds Cell Max With Solar Flare 
          




Krillin is presented with the unique opportunity to get back at Cell in some capacity when Cell Max is unleashed during the manga&#39;s ongoing Super Hero Saga. In Dragon Ball Super chapter #98 by writer Akira Toriyama and artist Toyotarou, Krillin activates Solar Flare so the android Gamma 2 can successfully carry out his special attack against Cell Max. Gamma 2&#39;s initial plan was to have everyone attack Cell Max at once to divert the rampaging giant away so he could connect his powerful &#34;head-on assault,&#34; as Gamma 1 described it. However, Cell Max manages to see Gamma 2, so Krillin blinds him with Solar Flare.

Although Krillin&#39;s contribution doesn&#39;t directly result in Cell Max&#39;s destruction, it&#39;s still effective. Not only does Krillin&#39;s Solar Flare incapacitate Cell Max, but it allows Gamma 2 to sever Cell Max&#39;s left arm. This creates the impression that Krillin is redeeming himself for all the times Cell used Solar Flare against him in Dragon Ball Z. Krillin easily gets back at him in Dragon Ball Super through Cell Max. Moreover, Super proves in the same chapter that Krillin has a good memory since he reminds Piccolo about his Great Namekian technique from Dragon Ball.






 Krillin&#39;s Experience Underscores Cell Max&#39;s Greatest Flaw 
          

Some fans&#39; initial reaction to Cell Max was mixed because it didn&#39;t act at all like the real Cell even though it looked just like his Semi-Perfect form. And now these same fans probably feel justified in their disappointment just for Krillin&#39;s sake. If Cell Max had the original&#39;s personality in Dragon Ball Super, then Krillin&#39;s revenge would have been much sweeter, but at least he got the chance at all.
