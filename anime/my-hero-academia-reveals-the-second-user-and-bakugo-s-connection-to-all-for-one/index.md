## Literature Review

All For One finally revealed the identity of the enigmatic second user and his similarities to Bakugo may be the key to the outcome of the final war.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #406 of My Hero Academia. My Hero Academia has finally revealed the identity of the mysterious second user and with it Bakugo&#39;s connection to All For One which could very well be the key to his fate in the final war and the finale of the series.




Despite the series quickly nearing its climax, the second user and his history with All For One remain largely a mystery. Not only have the glimpses of his battle against All For One perplexed readers but his similarities to Bakugo have given rise to plenty of speculation about the true connection between the two. That said, the latest chapter finally reveals the most crucial piece of the puzzle.

          

The latest chapter finally reveals that the second user is named Kudo and gives fans another glimpse into his battle against All For One in the past which finally explains the reason All For One seems to hate him as as well as Bakugo who bears a strong resemblance to him in appearance and spirit.

                  My Hero Academia Foreshadowed Bakugo&#39;s Final Battle   The matchups for the final battle are here, and Bakugo&#39;s has left fans stunned despite the series having hinted at his final battle multiple times.   





 All For One Blames the Second User for One For All&#39;s Existence 
          

Chapter #406 of My Hero Academia at last reveals that All For One hates the second user, Kudo, as he blames him for the creation of One For All as the power was created by him reaching out to Yoichi. All for One also feels his old hatred for Kudo rise up when he sees Bakugo whom he mistakes for Kudo due to their similar appearance, confirming the long-speculated parallels between the second user and Bakugo as well as the likelihood of Bakugo being All For One&#39;s fated final opponent.

All For One&#39;s strong hatred for Kudo possibly explains one of the biggest mysteries of their battle, particularly why All For One appeared to be crying towards the end. It is clear from the multiple instances where All For One has seen flashes of Kudo&#39;s face that despite his victory, the battle is one that left a mark on him. Despite seeing only One For All as a worthy opponent, Kudo&#39;s quirk, which he dismissed with its user was able to evolve enough to make the battle an annoyance.




                  My Hero Academia Finally Fixes Bakugo&#39;s Resurrection   Bakugo&#39;s situation in My Hero Academia has left some fans displeased, but the latest chapter may have fixed at least one problem with his return.   

          

At present, Bakugo seems to be following Kudo&#39;s exact footsteps as his abilities similarly continue to evolve to unprecedented heights, so much so that All For One mistakes him for Kudo. Bakugo may even prove to be an even bigger annoyance than the second user. In fact, he may even take things a step further and be the one to defeat All For One against all odds, making the final battle of the series an epic two-on-two.

All the same, Bakugo&#39;s final battle seems to be decided and his connection to the second user may just provide the thematic depth that the battle needed to be worthy of the finale. Regardless, My Hero Academia&#39;s final war is nowhere close to being over, leaving plenty of room for many more similar surprises and shocking revelations.

My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks.
