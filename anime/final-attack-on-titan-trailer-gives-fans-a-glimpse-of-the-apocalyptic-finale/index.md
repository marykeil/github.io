## Literature Review

With less than a week left before the epic finale of Attack On Titan, the main trailer has been released, promising an apocalyptic end to the series.




A few days before the airing of the finale of the Attack On Titan, the final trailer for the episode has been revealed. This last episode has taken much longer to be released than anticipated, with Mappa splitting the last chapters into three hour-long episodes. And now, the finale of Attack On Titan will be released on November 4.

The episode will be an hour and 26 minutes long. The visuals from the trailer look mesmerizing, and the action sequences have been done justice. The trailer sees the long-awaited return of Levi to action, and Mikasa Ackerman finally gets a much-needed powerup.

                  Attack on Titan Officially Returns With New Chapter   With the Attack On Titan manga over, the author has announced he will release a new chapter in 2024 that could serve as an epilogue to the series.   


 Attack on Titan&#39;s Finale Will Have The Most Intense Fights Yet 
          




Linked Horizon will once again perform the opening theme song, and it will be titled &#34;To You Two Thousand Years... Or... Twenty Thousand Years From Now...&#34;. The band&#39;s return has fans in a frenzy, as they made many songs for the series including opening songs for the first three seasons. They were also the makers of Attack On Titan&#39;s most popular song, Shinzo Wa Sasageyo. They are the perfect choice for the role, as it is only right that they perform for the finale since they were there at the beginning.

In a series where the action and fights are endless, the final episode of Attack On Titan promises several passionate and intense confrontations. Picking up where the last episode left off, Eren&#39;s friends and enemies have joined forces to put a stop to his genocidal plan. With the cast fighting for their homeland, stopping their friend, and getting revenge for lost ones this finale is a must-watch. Although it&#39;s unlikely to surpass fights like the one between Levi and Kenny, it will definitely stand out.
