Summary

  All For One&#39;s ultimate move in chapter #408 reveals the true meaning behind his name and his obsession with One For All, as his goal is to reclaim his brother Yoichi through it.   All For One&#39;s fixation on Yoichi is evident in chapter #407, where he views Yoichi as one of his possessions and is enraged by his defiance. This fuels his obsession with subduing Yoichi and obtaining One For All.   The revelation of All For One&#39;s true intentions adds depth to his character, recontextualizing his pursuit of One For All as stemming from his dysfunctional relationship with his brother.  







Driven into a corner by the heroes&#39; resolve, My Hero Academia&#39;s biggest villain, All For One, has revealed the final ace up his sleeve, and it may be the key to the meaning of his name. All For One has unleashed everything he has in a desperate attempt to reach Shigaraki in time, and his ultimate move at last reveals the one true motive behind his actions and his obsession with One For All.

In chapter #408 of My Hero Academia, All For One unleashes all of his stolen quirks in a last-ditch attempt to propel himself toward Shigaraki before his body rewinds itself completely. Besides being a grand spectacle, the villain&#39;s ultimate move is called All For One Goal, and it reveals the true meaning of All For One&#39;s name, which represents his one true desire to possess Yoichi through One For All.

          




The latest chapter implies that All For One&#39;s obsession with One For All is ultimately linked to his desire to maintain control over his brother, whom he views as one of his possessions, the only one that escaped his grasp.


 All For One&#39;s True Desire Is To Possess Yoichi, Not One For All 
          

Chapter #408 of My Hero Academia reveals All For One gave Yoichi his name, which when broken up also means &#34;the first thing given or bestowed to him.&#34; All For One goes on to reveal that his heinous actions, manipulations, and all that he has done have been in pursuit of Yoichi.

          

All For One&#39;s fixation on Yoichi is especially apparent in chapter #407, where he quite literally terms Yoichi as one of his possessions and is enraged by his defiance and refusal to remain under his control. All For One clearly views Yoichi as pitiful and insignificant, and his defiance fuels All For One&#39;s obsession with subduing him and, by extension, One For All. This idea is one that My Hero Academia has especially explored with Kudo, the second user of One for All, and Bakugo, who have both similarly infuriated All For One with their resolve despite their perceived insignificance.






 All For One&#39;s True Intentions Add Much Needed Depth To His Character 
          

All For One&#39;s origins and his dysfunctional relationship with Yoichi irrevocably recontextualize All For One&#39;s quest for One For All throughout My Hero Academia. Until now, All For One was presented as a power-hungry tyrant seeking world domination. His relentless pursuit of One For All and desire to eradicate it all together appeared to stem from simply wanting to get rid of an obstacle in his path or attaining the sweet satisfaction of obtaining the only quirk in the world out of his reach.

However, his character takes on a much more complex, psychological tone with the revelation of his true motivator being his brother all along. The latest chapter of My Hero Academia not only showed the visually impressive &#34;ultimate move&#34; of its villain, but it has also permanently altered fans&#39; perceptions of All For One while subsequently raising the stakes for the final battle yet again.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
