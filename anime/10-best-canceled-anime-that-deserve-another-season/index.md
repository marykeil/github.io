## Literature Review

Some of the best anime series deserving of continuations were cut short by low manga sales, licensing complications, and more. 




Some of the best canceled anime will leave audiences thirsting for more, and wondering why such amazing shows were ever canned when they clearly deserve another season. There is nothing more infuriating than watching an anime series in its entirety and then realizing that there are no more episodes, the story is left unfinished, and there is no hope for the series to make a return. Unfortunately, that is the case for a good deal of anime out there, even series with immense popularity.
The reason is that the anime industry still follows its traditional business model where anime are essentially advertisements for manga. If a manga’s sales fall, so does its anime. However, with the recent globalization of anime spearheaded by streaming companies such as Crunchyroll and Netflix, studios are forced to consider more remakes of older series, like with Bleach and Fruits Basket. Unfortunately, there are still anime like Hunter x Hunter that end awkwardly due to the manga artist going on hiatus. Although such a series could be considered canceled, the hope of resuscitation is much more tangible.
            
 
 10 Best Shonen Jump Manga Canceled Way Too Soon 
Weekly Shonen Jump is notorious for how quickly it will cancel a manga, and here are 10 Jump manga that were, unfortunately, canceled far too soon.












 








 10  Gamers! Is a Play on Romance 
Based on the light novel by Aoi Sekina and Saboten
        

 Release Year:  2017   Number of Episodes:  12   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Funimation, Amazon Prime Video    
The romance comedy anime Gamers! is a typical example of how an anime series gets canceled, or simply slips away into irrelevance. The premise of the story is actually quite interesting, as it follows a high schooler named Amano Keito, who is a passionately casual gamer. He meets the school idol, Tendo Karen, who is a gamer herself, but of a different, more competitive level. Despite that, she urges him to join the school game club, and a hilarious romance unfolds, full of twists and obliviousness. The show has its moments, but unfortunately, manga sales fell, and no subsequent season was scheduled.

 9  Flame of Recca Is One of the Older Ninja Shonen 
Based on the manga by Anzai Nobuyuki
        

 Release Year:  1997   Number of Episodes:  42   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime Video, The Roku Channel    
Flame of Recca is an older but interesting ninja series, predating the hit shonen Naruto. Although the series is similarly about ninjas, the art and narration styles differ from Naruto and run closer to the styles of Yu Yu Hakusho or Rurouni Kenshin. The story follows protagonist Hanabishi Recca, a modern-day highschooler who dreams of restoring ancient ninja practices. The anime starts to unfold once compelling villains and supernatural powers are introduced, but the show abruptly ends after 42 episodes after catching up with the manga. Unfortunately, by the time the manga finished, Flame of Recca was thoroughly forgotten.

 8  Beelzebub Is a Nanny Story in Disguise 
Based on the manga by Tamura Ryuuhei
        

 Release Year:  2011   Number of Episodes:  60   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime Video, The Roku Channel    
The anime Beelzebub is a unique shonen series that deviates from the typical shonen premise, but still incorporates riveting battles and similar plot developments. Furthermore, the fact that the series is based off of the journey of the son of the Demon Lord selecting a worthy nanny, creates various comedic situations. Baby in tow, high schooler Oga Tatsumi fights explosive battles around the school, protecting the title of Baby Beel’s guardian. Despite the series’ originality and initial success, due to subpar manga sales, the anime was ended prematurely and never reinstated.

Based on the manga by Shimabukuro Mitsutoshi


 







 Release Year:  2011   Number of Episodes:  147   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video    
Toriko was once a big name in shonen, and was a unique series that blended battle elements with the nuance that comes with food and cooking anime. The series created an original profession in a universe dominated by supernatural delicacies, called Gourmet Hunters. The main character, Toriko, is one such hunter who fights against exploitative organizations and wild beasts. As one of Toei Animation’s flagship series, Toriko even had multiple collaborations with One Piece and Dragon Ball Z. However, unlike the other two series, Toriko gradually fell into unpopularity, leading to even the manga’s cancelation.

 5  Yuri On Ice Is a BL Phenomenon 
An original series directed by Yamamoto Sayo
        

 Release Year:  2016   Number of Episodes:  12   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Funimation, Amazon Prime Video    
In 2016, Yuri On Ice took the world by storm, as the sports anime produced by MAPPA bolstered two niche concepts to maximum popularity. Firstly, figure skating, a sport typically only equated with the Olympics, was transformed into dazzling displays of animation. Secondly, the BL (boy’s love) genre was given much needed exposure, speaking to the LGBTQ&#43; community and beyond. Unfortunately, the anime was never slated for a second season due to revenue concerns, and although a Yuri On Ice film has perpetually been in production, it is unclear whether it will satiate the fans of the franchise.

 4  Magi Is an Underrated Franchise 
Based on the manga by Ohtaka Shinobu
        

 Release Year:  2012   Number of Episodes:  50 (2 seasons) &#43; 13 (Sinbad Spin-Off)   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Funimation, Amazon Prime Video    
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is an anime produced by A-1 Pictures that found success by bringing Arabian mythology to shonen through two seasons and a spin-off series based on one of the franchise’s supporting characters. Following the series’ second season, titled Magi: The Kingdom of Magic, just the fact that there was enough popularity for a side character (Sinbad) to create a full-production spin-off series of his childhood adventures speaks to the excellent work that Magi does. Unfortunately, despite its popularity, manga sales were what dictated the anime industry in the early 2010s, leading to many unfinished stories.

 3  Wotakoi Leaves Audiences Wanting More 
Based on the web manga by Fujita
        

 Release Year:  2018   Number of Episodes:  11 (season 1) &#43; 3 (OVA)   Where to Stream:  Amazon Prime Video    
The hit romance anime Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku is a lighthearted adult romance series targeted at an underrepresented audience. The story follows Otaku Momose Narumi through her working adult life, as she tries to keep her love of anime, games, and more a secret. However, old and new acquaintances lead her to embrace her interests, regardless of any stigmas, which eventually leads to a heartwarming romance. Unfortunately, just as the series is starting to unfold with new characters and relationships, the first season ends. Although there was a follow-up of three OVA episodes, there is ample argument for a renewed season.

 2  Yona of the Dawn Is a Magical Adventure Cut Short

 Release Year:  2014   Number of Episodes:  24 (season 1) &#43; 3 (OVA)   Where to Stream:  Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video    
The hit shojo anime, Yona of the Dawn, or Akatsuki no Yona, is a series produced by Studio Pierrot that weaves a hybrid story of adventure, coming-of-age, romance, and more.

 1  No Game No Life Season 2 Chants Have Even Frightened Production 
Based on the light novel by Kamiya Yuu


 







 Release Year:  2014   Number of Episodes:  12 (season 1) &#43; 1 (movie)   Where to Stream:  Hulu, Amazon Prime Video    
An incredibly popular isekai fantasy series produced by Madhouse, No Game No Life has long captured fans with its stunningly colorful animation, and fervent rallies for season 2 have long become a meme. The story follows a brother-sister pair who play games under the name “Blank,” boasting an undefeated record even after being transported to a fantasy world governed by the laws of all types of games. Although the series received a movie adaptation in 2017, the chants for season 2 stay strong, and unfortunately, unanswered. The author even speculates that production companies are afraid of letting down fans’ expectations.
