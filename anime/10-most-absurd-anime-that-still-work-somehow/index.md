## Literature Review

These titles should never work, yet somehow, against all odds, they find a way to be surprisingly entertaining and genuinely worthwhile.





Nonsensical shows aren&#39;t guaranteed to work – in fact, more often than not, basing a story on a premise that shouldn&#39;t work can be disastrous if not handled correctly. Sometimes, though, everything clicks into place and creates something truly special that encapsulates fans.









 








 10  Akiba Maid War 
        

The worlds of organized crime and maid cafés might seem completely parallel, never meant to interact, yet Akiba Maid War proves that this fusion works far better than it has any right to. Directed by Sauichi Masui, the same creative mind who directed Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, the show takes place in an alternative version of Akihabara where maids have to literally fight each other to ensure the success and stability of their cafés. Just as the maids balance customer service with armed warfare, this show perfectly balances comedic scenes with serious and emotional ones to deliver an unforgettable experience.





 9  Ya Boy Kongming! 
        

Reincarnation tales are far from uncommon in anime, given the ever-popular isekai trend. Still, there is no story quite like Ya Boy Kongming!, which takes a well-known Chinese strategist from the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Kongming, and transports him into the modern world. This is where he meets Eiko Tsukimi, an aspiring singer, and, inspired by her performance and the wonders of contemporary music, he sets his mind on helping her achieve stardom, becoming her manager in the process. While a &#34;fish out of water&#34; comedy isn&#39;t a new concept, especially in anime, this title hooked viewers with its premise, and captivated them with its execution.





 8  Assassination Classroom 
        

A former elite assassin has been turned into an octopus-like monster, whose special skills include the ability to reach Mach 20 speed, as well as being impervious to any weapon. As he claims to have destroyed the Moon, and is now planning to do the same to Earth, the only ones who can stop him are a class of delinquents taught by Koro-sensei himself. Nothing about Assassination Classroom&#39;s premise seems to make sense at first, which is why it lends itself so easily to absurd comedy. However, behind the comedic surface lies a complex show full of not only engrossing action scenes, but also serious, emotional moments, and well-written characters.





 7  Ben-To 
        

While everyone can appreciate a good discount, few would go as far as to fight over one, yet that&#39;s exactly what Ben-To is all about. Once bento boxes go on their nightly half-off sale, the supermarket turns into a battlefield, where a genuine war breaks out between bargain hunters looking for a cheap dinner. Admittedly, the show suffers from an over-abundance of fan service, as was the case for many titles at the time, but viewers who can overlook that are sure to find a series whose absurd premise is matched only by its over-the-top action scenes, with fighting sequences straight out of the best martial arts anime.





 6  Sarazanmai 
        

As Kappa zombies born out of people&#39;s deepest desires begin threatening the world, the Kappa prince Keppi, having lost most of his power, has no choice but to rely on others to fight back. He enlists three boys, takes their Shirikodama, and turns them into Kappa – telling them that victory requires them to connect with one another. Sarazanmai might sound and even look nonsensical at first, as one should expect from the director behind Penguindrum, but the strangeness is mostly surface level, merely using metaphors to tell a story about the importance of connections and secrets, in a similar vein to titles like Kiznaiver.





 5  Gundam Build Fighters 
        

Gundam may be one of the biggest and highest-grossing anime franchises ever, but one thing that every show generally has in common is that they all feature intricate, serious stories, with military conflicts that involve the use of powerful mobile suits. Gundam Build Fighters diverges from that formula significantly, as it chooses to revolve around the Gunpla themselves instead. The show follows Sei Iori, an expert Gunpla builder, and Reiji, a proficient Gunpla fighter, as they participate in tournaments together. In spite of the decidedly less serious tone, it still manages to impress viewers with dynamic action sequences and a suitably intense soundtrack.





 4  Cells at Work! 
        

As implied by its title, Cells at Work! sought to visualize the daily working life of cells in the human body. The show mostly follows a red cell who, having just finished training, is now dutifully transporting oxygen all around the body and learning about various other cells in the process. From white cells taking out harmful bacteria, to platelets working on construction projects, everyone must work together towards ensuring the well-being of their host body. Taking a strange, creative idea and applying a delightfully comedic twist to it, Cells at Work! achieved the impossible – it makes edutainment live up to its name.





 3  Uma Musume: Pretty Derby 
        

Even those who are otherwise not interested in fitness can appreciate sports anime, as they typically follow competitive characters aiming for great heights. After all, it is easy to connect with and be inspired by relatable and grounded protagonists who are relentlessly pursuing their passions. Uma Musume: Pretty Derby seems to completely ignore that idea, instead revolving around horses who are incarnated as horse girls, training at a special academy to become top racers. Yet, while the prospect of humanoid horse girls might seem unappealing, beyond that lies a surprisingly solid sports show, with unexpectedly captivating characters, whose evolution and rivalries make for an enjoyable experience.





 2  Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle 
        

Given just how common the trope of the villain kidnapping a defenseless princess is, viewers might think they know exactly what fate awaits Aurora Suya Rhys Kaymin, when she is taken hostage by the Demon Lord Tasogare. However, this princess defies all expectations. Rather than impatiently waiting to be rescued by a hero, terrified by the castle&#39;s monsters, her only concern is making herself as comfortable as possible, constantly seeking new methods to improve her sleep, even if takes her down bizarre, bite-sized adventures tormenting her captor. Taking a common situation and turning it into something completely different, Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle proves itself to be a surprisingly wholesome comedic experience.





 1  Zombieland Saga 
        

With the Love Live! franchise boosting the popularity of the idol anime genre, a parody such as Zombieland Saga was bound to be released at some point, but no one could have predicted just how successful it would become. The story is based on the idea of reviving girls from different eras to create a zombie idol group, with the purpose of economically revitalizing a Japanese prefecture. While definitely original, it&#39;s easy to imagine how such a premise would lend itself to absurd comedic scenes. However, MAPPA managed to produce something that goes far beyond slapstick comedy, perfectly blending lighthearted moments with well-written, emotional backstories, intriguing characters, and meaningful music.
These series are all surprising in different ways, whether they combine worlds that should never interact, or take a familiar idea and turn it on its head, telling a completely unexpected story instead. Regardless, what they all have in common is that they figured out the best way to make the most of their ridiculous situations, telling stories that manage to stay relatable and enjoyable even in the wildest of contexts. Though their uniquely creative premise means that a similar experience may never be replicated, that only makes the best absurd anime shows that much better.
