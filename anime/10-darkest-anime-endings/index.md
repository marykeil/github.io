 10  Princess Mononoke 
Whether the Characters Will Learn from Their Mistakes is Left Unanswered


 







  Year Released   1997    Runtime   2h 14m    Where to Stream it   Netflix, YouTube Premium, Google Play Store, Apple TV    
All things considered, although it comes at a high cost, Princess Mononoke has a fairly optimistic ending, with the caveat that there&#39;s no guarantee that the peace achieved will workout in the long run. The Forest Spirit and San&#39;s adoptive mother Moro are dead, and both Iron Town and the forest are left devastated. On the other hand, the curse afflicting Ashitaka has been lifted, the inhabitants of Iron Town survived, and Lady Eboshi seems resolved to go forward living in harmony with nature, and the forest begins to recover with the re-emergence of a lone kodama spirit.
Despite all that, the film is left open-ended enough that there&#39;s no guarantee that Lady Eboshi and the inhabitants of Iron Town will stay committed to their harmony with nature. There&#39;s a clear possibility that Iron Town will lapse back into its old ways of greed and exploiting the natural world, thereby restarting the cycle of violence and revenge that drove the conflict of the movie in the first place.





 9  Code Geass 
Lelouch Destroys Himself to Save the World
        

  Year Released   2006    Number of Episodes   50 (and 4 movies)    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video    
Throughout Code Geass, Lelouch uses both his natural cunning and his supernatural Geass powers to manipulate the various political factions so he can break the power of the Holy Britannian Empire and liberate Japan from Britannian occupation. His plan takes the form of setting himself up to be perceived as a cruel tyrant to unite the entire world against himself. Essentially, Lelouch is creating a villain and manufacturing a crisis to unify the characters and factions that would otherwise be fighting each other.
Lelouch&#39;s Geass is based on a concept from Irish mythology that is written in modern English as either &#39;geas&#39; or &#39;geis&#39; and pronounced like &#39;gesh&#39;. A geas is a supernatural obligation placed upon a person that can only be broken with grave consequences. 

Lelouch&#39;s plan is ultimately successful, with Code Geass culminating in Lelouch&#39;s engineering of his own assassination. Lelouch sacrifices both his life and even his reputation for the benefit of the entire world. The true tragedy of Code Geass is that Lelouch will be remembered by the entire world as a hated tyrant and no one will ever know just what he gave up to make the world a better place.





 8  Cowboy Bebop 
Spike (Probably) Goes Out in a Blaze of Glory


 







  Year Released   1998    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, Youtube Premium, Tubi    
Even before the closing episodes of Cowboy Bebop, the series takes a markedly grim turn before Spike&#39;s final showdown with Vicious and the Red Dragon Syndicate. The series&#39; longstanding comic relief characters Ed and Ein leave the Bebop crew, setting the tone for the final episodes. Spike says his goodbyes to Jet and Faye, then sets off to single-handedly take on the entire Red Dragon Syndicate, despite knowing he&#39;ll likely die in the attempt. Sure enough, although Spike succeeds in finally taking down Vicious, the series ends with a seriously injured Spike pointing a finger gun at the camera, saying &#34;bang&#34; and then collapsing.
Although Cowboy Bebop&#39;s abrupt ending leaves Spike&#39;s fate ambiguous, the way the scene is presented doesn&#39;t look good for his survival. Even if Spike does survive his wounds, the ending is still fundamentally a tragedy. Spike had to give up basically everything, including the bonds he made with the rest of the Bebop crew to finally bring down Vicious and the Red Dragon Syndicate.





 7  Witchblade 
Masane Gives Up Everything for the Sake of Her Daughter
        

  Year Released   2006    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Apple TV, Google Play Store    
One of several adaptations of the Image Comics series following the wielders of the Witchblade artifact that takes the form of magic armor, the anime version of Witchblade, despite its post-apocalyptic setting and intense action, is fundamentally a story about motherhood. In the series, the Witchblade&#39;s wielder is Masane Ahama, a single mother of six-year-old Rihoko.
Masane&#39;s ongoing efforts to protect Rihoko from both the Witchblade itself and a shadowy, malevolent megacorporation culminate in her sacrificing her life to destroy the genetically engineered living weapons that have been threatening her and Rihoko throughout the series. The tragedy of Masane&#39;s sacrifice is mitigated somewhat by the fact that Rihoko not only survives the series, but ends up safely with a newfound family among Masane&#39;s friends and allies.





 6  Puella Magi Madoka Magica 
Madoka Leaves the World Behind to Become the Embodiment of Hope
        

  Year Released   2011    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Although traditional Magical Girl anime are no strangers to dark moments, Puella Magi Madoka Magica embraces the darkness inherent to the concept of enlisting teenage girls to fight horrifying monsters. Throughout the series, fighting Witches head-on is shown to be the wrong choice, with the cast being killed off again and again with each timeline reset.
Ultimately, the Witches are only defeated when Madoka makes a wish that creates a time paradox preventing the Witches from ever existing in the first place. Unfortunately, in the process, she gave up her physical being to transcend into a goddess-like spirit of hope and guardian of the souls of magical girls. Though this does make Madoka one of anime&#39;s strongest characters, her loss is particularly hard-hitting for Homura as Madoka&#39;s wish essentially erases her from existence altogether. Ultimately, no one remembers that she ever existed aside from Homura and Madoka&#39;s little brother.





 5  JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Phantom Blood 
Dio&#39;s Victory Sets the Rest of the Series into Motion
        

  Year Released   2012    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Netflix, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube Premium    
Despite being a villain, Dio Brando is one of the most important characters in the JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure franchise. Playing the role of direct antagonist in the first and third parts, Dio&#39;s influence remains felt throughout the rest of the franchise. Dio&#39;s ongoing importance to the series, whether by playing a direct role or through later villains carrying on his legacy, is largely thanks to the fact that Dio basically won at the end of Phantom Blood.
Although Jonathan interfered with Dio&#39;s plans in Phantom Blood, it came at the cost of his own life and he only managed to slow Dio down rather than stop him altogether. Thanks to Jonathan&#39;s sacrifice, Dio&#39;s victory may not have been as comprehensive as it would have been otherwise, but Phantom Blood still ends on a fairly bleak note, especially given Dio was still playing a role in the series all the way into Stone Ocean.





 4  Cyberpunk Edgerunners 
True to the Genre, the Anime Doesn&#39;t Have a Happy Ending
        

  Year Released   2022    Number of Episodes   10    Where to Stream it   Netflix    
As a general rule, Cyberpunk stories are fairly bleak and depict aesthetically bright but morally bankrupt settings. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is no exception. The world of the original Cyberpunk tabletop game and its video game adaptation, Cyberpunk 2077, is particularly grim, meaning Edgerunners is not exactly an uplifting series. As the heists start going wrong, main characters get killed off even before Adam Smasher shows up to single-handedly obliterate the rest. Lucy and Falco are the only main characters to survive, and although Lucy achieves her dream of getting to the Moon, it isn&#39;t really worth the price of what it took to get there.





 3  Basilisk 
A Ninja-Themed Spin on Romeo and Juliet Comes to its Inevitable Conclusion
This entry contains discussions of suicide. 

        

  Year Released   2005    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, YouTube Premium, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV    
The underlying tragedy in Basilisk is driven by the drama of historical Japanese politics. The rival Koga and Iga ninja clans are being manipulated by the Shogun and his court. To determine the Shogun&#39;s successor, the court has the two clans fight it out on behalf of the two potential heirs, despite the two clans having a truce when the series begins. This puts the heirs of the clans, Gennosuke of the Koga and Oboro of the Iga, into the positions of Romeo and Juliet, in love with each other but caught in the middle of their two feuding families.
By the end of Basilisk, every named member of both clans is dead, usually killed in a graphic and brutal fashion. Unfortunately, Gennosuke and Oboro only end up together in death after they both commit suicide. Technically, the Iga clan wins, though only because Gennosuke decides to declare them the winners in honor of Oboro shortly before his grief-fueled death.





 2  Grave of the Fireflies 
An Unflinching Depiction of the Closing Days of World War II
        

  Year Released   1988    Runtime   1h 29m    Where to Stream it   Rent on Apple TV    
A film by Studio Ghibli, Grave of the Fireflies follows the orphaned siblings Setsuko and Seita in the aftermath of the Allied bombing of Kobe in March 1945. Both the bombing itself and its aftermath are depicted in excruciating detail. Grave of the Fireflies is dark every step of the way, culminating with both Setsuko and Seita dying. As bleak as the ending is, there&#39;s at least a glimmer of hope, as the spirits of Setsuko and Seita get to see the rebuilt city of Kobe in the modern day from the afterlife. Grave of the Fireflies is a difficult movie to watch, but it&#39;s rightfully gone down as one of the greatest anime movies of all time, largely because of its sheer emotional weight.





 1  Berserk (1997) 
The Anime Adaptation Ends with the Manga&#39;s Bleakest Moment


 







  Year Released   1997    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Currently unavailable to stream    
The Eclipse is one of Berserk&#39;s most important moments and it&#39;s also one of the franchise&#39;s bleakest and most horrifying. Griffith sacrifices the rest of the Band of the Hawk to join the Godhand and become Femto, Guts and Casca are brutalized physically and mentally, the other members of the Band of the Hawk are graphically devoured by demons, and then the series basically just ends.
The one fleeting piece of optimism is a post-credits scene showing Guts setting off in pursuit of revenge against Griffith, but there&#39;s no indication that Guts will ultimately be successful. Neither the characters nor the audience have any chance to really process the nightmare they&#39;ve just witnessed. Though the manga shows Guts eventually finding hope and even a sense of community, the 1997 anime offers no hint of that, naturally making it the darkest anime ending of all time.
Although the 1997 anime is not currently available to stream, the 2022 adaptation Berserk: The Golden Age - Memorial Edition is available to stream on Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime Video. 

Although ending in the immediate aftermath of the Eclipse makes for an incredibly bleak ending, at the time the 1997 anime adaptation was produced, the original manga itself had only reached the aftermath of the Eclipse, so there were no later story arcs available to adapt. Such a bleak, open-ended conclusion to the anime adaptation was really the only possible option. Notably, difficulties with adapting the original Berserk manga have led to most adaptations in other media focusing on the Golden Age Arc, with the Eclipse as the inevitable endpoint.
Some of the best anime out there end on remarkably bleak and grim notes. Thanks to some excellent storytelling and their profound emotional weight, even these grim endings can provide a satisfying resolution to the plot. Anime fans looking for powerful anime stories shouldn&#39;t be scared off by the darkest anime endings.
