## Literature Review

It has been speculated that Sasuke would be killed off in Boruto, but the newest chapter reveals his actual fate is much worse than that.




Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter 4The plot intensifies in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, and chapter 4 has huge bombshells, with the biggest one is Sasuke&#39;s fate. There has been a lot of speculation about Sasuke since the beginning of the manga&#39;s second part, and it has been a fairly accepted theory that something terrible would happen to him, most likely death, but the recent chapter shows that what actually happened to him is so much worse than death.




Chapter 4 featured an intense fight between Boruto and new villains who could be the series&#39; most powerful yet. One of the villains looked a lot like Sasuke, but it was brushed off in light of the shocking revelations.

          

However, at the end of the chapter, Boruto rests on a tree that trapped Sasuke. Nobody could&#39;ve seen this development, as the mighty and powerful Sasuke fell victim to Code&#39;s grimes.

                  Code Is Not Boruto&#39;s Worst Villain, He&#39;s A Genius Misdirection   While prime Boruto antagonist Code continues to be embarrassed, the creators have fans just where they want them for his ultimate resurgence.   


 Sasuke Has Been Trapped in a Tree By the Grimes 
          




Grimes are monsters that Code created from the Ten-Tails and are very similar to White Zetsu. They are much more dangerous though as anyone they turn into a tree will be incapacitated. Not only is there no way to bring them back, but the Ten Tails can make a copy of that person and manifest itself. It seems that Sasuke was attacked by a Grime, which explains why Boruto didn&#39;t outright kill Code but instead asked him to stop the Grimes and release everyone who&#39;s been turned into a tree.

It&#39;s heartbreaking that the Ten-Tails chose to manifest itself as Sasuke, which made his fate even more tragic. The clone of Sasuke looks exactly like him and can use all of his abilities, including the Chidori, as seen in the fight with Boruto. Additionally, the clone possesses a Rinnegan and all of Sasuke&#39;s techniques, making it one of the most formidable enemies in the series, given the original Sasuke&#39;s immense power. This fight might be Boruto&#39;s toughest challenge yet, not only due to the opponent&#39;s strength but also because of the emotional attachment he has to his mentor.




The stage has finally been set for Boruto and Kawaki to take over. Naruto has already been sealed away by Kawaki at the end of part 1, and now Boruto&#39;s mentor has more or less suffered the same fate. Although it is a relief that the fan-favorite Sasuke hasn&#39;t been killed off, his capture by the Grime is just as bad if not worse. Boruto said at the end that Sasuke will have to wait a little longer, which means that he has a plan to bring him.
