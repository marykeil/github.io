Summary

  The battle between Amethio and the Black Rayquaza in episode 33 of Pokémon Horizons showcased the true power of legendary Pokémon.   Despite using two Pokémon, Amethio was no match for Rayquaza, highlighting the immense power of the legendary Pokémon.   The battle served as a reminder to all characters in Pokémon Horizons that they have a long way to go before achieving their goals and demonstrated the terrifying power possessed by Rayquaza.  







Episode #33 of Pokémon Horizons featured one of the series&#39; most impressive battles to date, with Amethio facing off against the Black Rayquaza. The epic clash really conveyed the true power wielded by a legendary Pokémon, making it clear how these creatures earned their nearly-godlike reputations.

The episode opens with Amethio tracking the Black Rayquaza in his submarine, and surfacing the moment they get a signal that it&#39;s appeared overhead. Amethio comes out of the sub and throws out both his Pokémon, Ceruledge and Corviknight, and then brandishes an Ultra Ball, declaring his intent to capture Rayquaza. Rayquaza pays him little mind until he orders his Pokémon to launch a combined attack, which draws Rayquaza&#39;s ire.

          




Thus begins one of the most brutal beatdowns in Pokémon history, with Rayquaza truly proving what it means to be a Legendary Pokémon with its raw power.



The English dub of Pokémon Horizons is scheduled to debut in the US on Netflix on February 23, 2023.




Rayquaza Gives Amethio the Beatdown of a Lifetime
          

Despite using two Pokémon, Amethio is no match for Rayquaza at all. While initially avoiding Rayquaza&#39;s attacks, Amethio&#39;s Ceruledge managed to land what should&#39;ve been a powerful hit, only for Rayquaza not to react. Rayquaza then swats Amethio&#39;s Ceruledge out of the air hard, sending it hurtling into an island below and creating a crater. It wasn&#39;t done yet, however; Rayquaza then proceeded to repeatedly attack the crater with Dragon Pulse in a brutal display of power. The battle&#39;s end looked more like something out of Dragon Ball Z than Pokémon, showing how much the series has changed since Ash.




Legendary Pokémon are meant to have immense power, but the anime hasn&#39;t always made them seem as powerful as they should be. The Black Rayquaza has changed all that, though, and it&#39;s only thanks to Terapagos taking on its own powerful form that Rayquaza&#39;s rampage was put to an end. Amethio&#39;s experience is what most trainers who decide to go after Legendary Pokémon would face: utter humiliation at the hands of one of the most powerful beings on the planet. Amethio has even proven he&#39;s a fairly competent trainer, despite his track record against Friede, but that didn&#39;t change the outcome of his battle with Rayquaza one bit.


 Rayquaza is Beyond Every Character&#39;s Strength 
          

Fortunately, Amethio&#39;s Ceruledge is shown to be okay later in the episode after having a chance to rest and recover; its defeat was so vicious that it would&#39;ve been easy to believe it was annihilated entirely. Rayquaza made it apparent that, good guys or bad guys, there&#39;s no character currently in the show that can even pose a challenge to it, making Roy&#39;s dream of mastering Rayquaza still just that: a dream. Rayquaza&#39;s power is legitimately terrifying, with even Friede scared for the kids&#39; safety. This devastating battle has made it clear to everyone in Pokémon Horizons that they have a lot further to go before achieving their goals, and provided fans with a true display of a Legendary Pokémon&#39;s power.
