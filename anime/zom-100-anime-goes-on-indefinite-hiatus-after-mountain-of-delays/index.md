## Literature Review

The anime adaptation of Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead has recently been announced as being put on indefinite hiatus with no return date.





Following delays to previous episodes, which have been simulcast for international audiences via Crunchyroll, the remaining three episodes of the series have been delayed indefinitely. Previously, the air dates several episodes have been delayed by as much as a week. Now, the remaining three episodes of the adaptation&#39;s scheduled 12-episode season have been delayed until further notice with no estimated return date for the series. As reported by Anime News And Facts via Twitter, the comedy-horror series is going on indefinite hiatus until further notice:





 

The reason for this hiatus has not yet been given, but it likely has to do with the production issues that Zom 100 has experienced, which somewhat hindered the momentum of the series after its first episodes received critical acclaim.


 Zom 100 Falls Victim Of Its Own Satire 
          

Based on the manga by writer Haro Aso and illustrator Kotaro Takata, Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead follows office worker Akira Tendo as he embraces the freedom created by a zombie apocalypse to live life to the fullest with his previous obligations upended. After the first episode of Zom 100 originally aired on July 9, the air dates for most of the subsequent episodes were delayed due to production issues. Despite these frequent delays, the anime adaptation of Zom 100 has been popular with fans.




Previously, episodes four through nine were delayed past their originally scheduled air dates by up to a week. In addition to recurring production issues facing the series, scheduling conflicts affecting the original Japanese broadcast also caused episodes to be delayed. It would be really ironic if Zom 100&#39;s delays were really due to the studio not being able to keep up with the amount of work, considering that the anime is a satire of that demanding system and toxic work culture, with Akira&#39;s company identified with the PokÃ©mon anime studio.

No further information about the reason for the hiatus has been announced, and it is currently unknown when the remaining three of the 12 scheduled episodes of Zom 100 are expected to air either in Japan on for the international streaming audience. This announcement of the anime adaptation going on indefinite hiatus with no estimated return date is surely going to come as terrible news for fans of Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead.

Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead is available to stream on Crunchyroll.
