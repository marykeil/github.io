## Literature Review

Boruto introduced new villains that rival the likes of Akatsuki and Kara, and are bound to be the strongest to ever appear in the series.




Warning: Spoilers for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter #4




Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has finally introduced a new group of villains that will hopefully be on the same level as those who made Naruto memorable. While the Otsutsuki such as Ishikki and Momoshiki were interesting on their own, these new villains are on a whole other level.

With Boruto now becoming extremely overpowered, the only villain left Code was no match for him, and the series desperately needed new villains. The obvious choices were Eida and Daemon, but chapter #4 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex introduced the series&#39; most powerful villains to date.

          

These four creatures are &#34;self-aware Divine Trees&#34;, born after Code&#39;s Claw Grimes, born from the Ten-Tails, absorbed human beings and gained new consciousness and powers. They are so strong that even the now-overpowered Boruto ran away immediately as it seemed like there was no way he could defeat them.





 Boruto Faces His Strongest Enemies Yet 
          

The self-aware Divine Trees are a new type of being born from the Ten-Tails
Boruto teleported to Code&#39;s hideout using the Flying Raijin, as he feared something disastrous was going to happen with the Ten-Tails and the Claw Grimes. In chapter #2, he told Code to withdraw the Grimes while he could still control them, which meant that he foresaw that the monsters would get a will of their own. He was unfortunately too late, as the Ten-Tails became more than just a chakra-hungry beast, it became intelligent and unleashed four copies of people who were &#34;devoured&#34; by the Grimes, one of them being Sasuke.

What makes these villains terrifying is that they not only have the Rinnegan, but they have access to the Ten-Tails&#39; infinite well of chakra. Originally, a Divine Tree is born when a Ten-Tails (which is actually its seedling), is fed the life of an Otsutsuki. The result is a Chakra Fruit that contains all the energy of an entire planet. These self-aware Divine Trees were born from the unwanted evolution of Code&#39;s Ten-Tails, after it fed on humans rather than Otsutsuki. Beating them might prove almost impossible for Boruto, who is not only fighting by himself but is also facing threats from Kawaki and Code. Fortunately, Boruto has Kashin Koji as an ally now.




          

The Sasuke Grime used a technique similar to Chidori, which proves that these copies have the same abilities and jutsu as the originals. Added to the might of the Ten-Tails, this means they outclass even godlike villains seen in the past, such as the Otsutsuki, whose ultimate goal was to fuse with the Ten-Tails. These new villains don&#39;t have that weakness, as they are a manifestation of the creature itself. Added to that is the fact that they have an incredibly dangerous goal: Divine Trees have the purpose of sucking out all chakra from a planet. These self-aware Divine Trees however are evolving and learning with every moment, meaning they will likely have an even more sinister goal.

It&#39;s been hard for Boruto to present its fans with villains that could be considered on the same level as those of Naruto, a series that stood out, among other things, for its memorable villains. Part 1 of Boruto wasn&#39;t always successful in that endeavor, but Two Blue Vortex is clearly setting out to fix that, presenting a new group of villains that already appear to be the most powerful and threatening in the entire franchise.
