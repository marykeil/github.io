## Literature Review

Just like his father, Boruto and the Next-Gen have no issue getting into a scrap if warranted, but what were battles that set the series apart?




Just like Naruto before it, Boruto is a shōnen battle series and features some truly incredible fights. Despite some fans&#39; problems with the sequel series, Boruto is filled with some of the best, most dazzling battles in the franchise. Naturally, as the next generation Konoha Village shinobi, the fights, fighting styles, and tactical approaches of the battles in Boruto are different than in Naruto.
Fans should not expect to see a carbon copy of the melee that happened in Naruto. One new yet interesting tweak of the fighting styles in Boruto includes the addition of scientific ninja tools and enhanced ninja technology. Contrary to some fans&#39; complaints, the additional elements of battle enhance the fights and in many instances raise the enjoyment fans get from observing them. Nevertheless, one cannot deny the martial poetry of the best Boruto battles.









 








 10  Boruto vs. Kawaki - A Preview of The Ultimate Fight 
Chapter #31 | Episode #292
        

From the very first pages of the series, fans understood that its final battle would be between Boruto and Kawaki. But with the possibility that the series could go on indefinitely, it’s a big ask by Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto to have fans wait possibly years before we see that confrontation. That’s why the first real fight between Boruto and Kawaki is so important.
Boruto and Kawaki&#39;s first fightgives fans a taste of what’s to come – and it does not disappoint. Combining their innate and studied abilities with the Otsutsuki powers their kama gives them access to - the fight between the two brothers puts to rest any idea that the leaders of the Next-Gen are not comparable to their elders. Moreover, it begs the question, how powerful will they be after they fully master their abilities?

 9  Naruto vs. Delta - A Kara Inner Moves To Eliminate the Uzumaki Threat 
Chapters #31-32 | Episode #198
        

Despite Jigen / Isshiki’s Kara organization quickly establishing itself as the major threat, there was a considerable lack of serious confrontation between the opposing forces – especially between their most senior members. That changes with the fight between Naruto and Delta. Naruto vs. Delta sees Konoha’s Hokage face off against one of Kara’s Inner. As such, it gives fans an idea of what strengths and abilities Kara will deploy against Konoha.
Despite Naruto only operating at a measure of his full strength, Delta clearly shows she is not an opponent to be trifled with as she displays tremendous strength, power, and speed. Delta shows that, outside of the Hokage, it is unlikely there are many other shinobi in Konoha who could take her down.





 8  New Team 7 vs. Boro - The New Team Shows Their Skills 
Chapters #39-41 | Episode #206


Outside of its visually mesmerizing, frenetic action the battle between the new Team 7 and Boro has several other elements that mark it as a critical point in the story and in the development of the characters involved. To begin with, Boro’s strength and experience forced the team members to put aside their individual desires to be the hero so they could work together for a coordinated attack that ended up being greater than the sum of its parts.
This is the fight where the new Team 7 truly learned the value of the age-old “united we stand, divided we fall” doctrine. This led to upgrades in the abilities of individual members such as Sarada’s increased proficiency in using Sharingan and Chidori, and the first time reveal of what happens when Momshiki takes control over Boruto.





 7  Sakura vs. Shin - Sakura Proves She&#39;s Still A Top Ninja 
Episode #23


While Boruto is ostensibly the sequel to Naruto, for much of Part I, there was a significant presence of older Naruto characters. However, while Naruto, Sasuke, and Shikamaru are depicted in important positions of power, Sakura - despite her well-documented abilities - largely staays away from action. The fight between Sakura and Shin, however, is one of the rare occasions where Sakura is freed from her domestic prison and allowed to prove once again what makes her one of the strongest Konoha shinobi.
Motherhood has clearly not led to a decline in Sakura’s abilities as the way she throws around humongous pillars like a ping pong ball suggests she might have gotten stronger. This all begs the question of why fans haven’t seen more of Sakura and her abilities in Boruto.

 6  Kawaki vs. Garō - Kawaki Proves He&#39;s Not Someone To Be Trifled With 
Chapter #25 | Episode #189


There was a time when Kawaki was the new kid on the block and not much was known about him or his abilities. That is why Kawaki&#39;s battle against Garo marks such an important point in his development. In addition to being one of the more visually dazzling fight scenes, it also serves as a reveal party of sorts as it displays Kawki&#39;s strength, abilities and mindset. 
Fans learn that Kawaki is indeed a skilled fighter whose martial arts mastery makes him dangerous in any combat situation. Perhaps more importantly though, Boruto shows that Kawaki has no qualms about putting an opponent down for good. Unlike his morally inclined counterparts, Kawaki does not overthink the issue, preferring to eliminate threats outright.





 5  Naruto and Sasuke vs. Jigen - Konoha&#39;s Dynamic Duo At Their Finest 
Chapters #37-38 | Episode #204


While fans have seen more than a few Naruto and Sasuke team-ups in Naruto – with the most consequential being their effort to take down Kaguya Otsutsuki, there has been a screaming lack of team-up situations where both are at the height of their powers, skills, and experience. That is why their fight against Jigen stands out as one the most important fights of both stories.
Naruto and Sasuke&#39;s fight with Jigen isan amazing display of power, precision, and collaboration. It’s clear that the years of fighting together and against one another have established a martial chemistry between the two that few duos can compare with. Equally important in the fight is Jigen’s response. He provides further proof that the Otsutsuki Clan remains the toughest force of evil in the Naruto-verse.





 4  Naruto vs. Isshiki - Naruto Reveals The Baryon Mode 
Chapters #51-52 | Episode #217


If the first Naruto–Sasuke confrontation with Jigen / Isshiki was a testament to the power of friendship, the second time Naruto faced off against a fully-manifested Isshiki proved that friends can be found in the strangest places. In this case, the friend was Kurama who, after all these years, finally allowed Naruto to tap into his considerable power and strength. The combination creates Naruto&#39;s most powerful form Baryon Mode – and it is spectacular. Not only does it allow Naruto to strike Isshiki at will and with maximum effect, it also reduces Isshiki’s life as each strike has a secondary effect of sucking out a portion of Isshiki’s chakra. It would be the perfect response but for the fact that it was so powerful it required all of Kuruma’s energy – effectively killing him in the process.

 3  Koji Kashin vs. Isshiki Otsutsuki - A Sannin Returns 
Chapters #47-48 | Episode #214
        

For most of his presence in Boruto, Kara Inner Kashin Koji was a peculiar character. Although he was a dedicated member of one of the most heinous criminal organizations in the world, he was always working at cross purposes with it while nursing a barely hidden disdain for its leader, Jigen. Debate on his true roles ranged from him being a deep state undercover spy for Konoha to being an interested third party who just wants to sow chaos. All those theories came to a head in his confrontation with Jigen. In addition to being a visually stunning battle in the best traditions of the Naruto-verse, it confirms Koji’s true mission was assassinating Jigen and reveals Koji’s relationship to Naruto fan-favorite Jiraiya.





 2  Boruto vs. Momoshiki - A Next Gen Star Is Born 
Chapter #9 | Episodes #65-66
        

The fight between Boruto and Momoshiki Otsutsuki is consequential on so many levels. First, it shows a distinct maturation of Boruto as a shinobi and potential future leader in the Konoha community. Second, it makes clear to Naruto and Sasuke that Boruto is much more than the anti-authority, bratty kid personality he seems to enjoy pretending to be. The fight sees a pre-teen going mano-a-mano with a senior member of the clan responsible for much of the tragedy Konoha Village has suffered since its establishment.
If there was any doubt that Boruto could be a hero, it was dismissed by his actions in defeating Momoshiki while saving Naruto and Sasuke in the process. Perhaps, most importantly, the fight set in motion the eventual combination of Boruto and Momoshiki – an entity fans have come to term &#34;Boru-shiki&#34; - that has and will continue to influence the saga’s eventual conclusion.





 1  Boruto vs. Code - Boruto&#39;s Greatest Fight Yet 
Chapter #63-64 | Episode #291-292
        

Although Code has suffered a crisis of confidence within the Boruto fandom over his ability to uphold the position as one of the saga’s main evil threats, his history as a member of Kara’s Inner and Isshiki’s most faithful acolyte means those who take his abilities for granted do so at considerable personal risk. This was most clearly illustrated in his fight with Boruto.
The fight was more about “feeling out” the other’s abilities in preparation for a more intense &#34;no holds barred&#34; future tilt. In the fight, we learn more about the power of Code’s claw marks, which were quite effective, even though his abilities had been limited by Amado. Accordingly, much like the fight between Boruto and Kawaki, this fight provides a sneak peek of what is yet to come – which based on Code’s posthumous conversation with Isshiki might be the most important confrontation of all. All of this adds up to making Boruto Vs. Code the series&#39; best fight.
