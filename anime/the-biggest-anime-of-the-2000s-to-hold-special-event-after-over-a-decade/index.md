## Literature Review

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was the biggest anime of the 2000s, and one of its biggest events is set to return after over a decade.





The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya still has plenty of merit as a franchise, and that idea is on full display with the announcement of the reviving of one of its biggest events. It was recently announced that not only would Haruhi Suzumiya be receiving a new light novel, but that it would also bring back its concert event, “The Symphony of Haruhi Suzumiya”, in 2024, with many of the principal voice cast hosting. Something like this would be big on its own, but what makes it even bigger is that it could lead to an announcement of the anime’s revival, and that would be great to see after so long.





 The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya Could Be Teasing A Season 3 
          

With the revival of “The Symphony of Haruhi Suzumiya”, the biggest question to ask is if this is going to be used to announce The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya season 3. Haruhi Suzumiya hasn’t been very relevant in a long time, so such a big event for the franchise returning after 15 years could easily mean that something new is in the works. Some of the voice actors attending the event also adds to the idea, as voice actors are often present for announcements surrounding their anime, and the series receiving a new light novel also shows a continued interest in the franchise, so a season 3 announcement is certainly possible.

That being said, it’s also possible that there won’t be any announcement of that sort. Voice actors attending a special event doesn’t guarantee that an announcement of anything will happen, and when Haruhi Suzumiya received a new light novel in 2020 after a nine-year hiatus, The Intuition of Haruhi Suzumiya, nothing more came of that, so the new light novel also might not be indicative of anything. All in all, there’s no way of knowing if there will be anything more to the concert at this time, and any new information about the franchise likely won’t be revealed until after its conclusion.






 The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya’s Concert Is Exciting On Its Own 
          

Even if The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya season 3 isn’t announced at “The Symphony of Haruhi Suzumiya”, there’s still plenty to be excited about with the concert. The original concert reworked the signature songs of the anime into beautiful orchestral pieces courtesy of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, so getting a chance to hear those sorts of renditions again, in addition to any new songs that might be performed, is still worth getting excited for if someone’s a fan of the series. It might not be what fans of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya were waiting for, but it’s sure to be a big event, either way.
