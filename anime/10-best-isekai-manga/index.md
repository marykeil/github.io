## Literature Review

Thanks to its quick rise to popularity, many believe the isekai genre to be overcrowded and full of unoriginal titles, but these are some of the best.




Given the trending popularity of the genre, it may be difficult to assess which isekai manga is actually worth reading, and which is but another uninspired addition to the ubiquitous genre instead. Most isekai stories begin as light novels, which then get an anime and/or manga adaptation once they are popular enough. For manga fans, then, isekai is not always the go-to choice.
Finding a worthwhile isekai title to dedicate one&#39;s attention to can be quite a daunting task, even more so than for other genres. After all, some seem to have original and refreshing premises only to fail when it comes to the execution, while others may sound unoriginal at first glance only to prove readers wrong once they&#39;re hooked, revealing themselves to be much more than the sum of their parts. These are ten great isekai manga that are worth the reader&#39;s time.









 








 10  The Eminence in Shadow 
        

Anri Sakano and Daisuke Aizawa&#39;s The Eminence in Shadow revolves around Cid Kagenou, a boy who always saw himself as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a secret mastermind who would otherwise be easily mistaken for a mob-type character. While he could never fully realize his dreams in his previous life, being reborn in a new magical world was the perfect opportunity for him to finally bring his imagination to life and create a mysterious organization, fighting against an imaginary cult that turned out to be real. While the protagonist may be overpowered, his situation and personality allow Cid Kagenou to stand out, even among other fantastic isekai titles.





 9  The Faraway Paladin 
        

After living an uneventful life, William was reborn in a fantastical world, where he would be raised by an eclectic group of undead in the City of the Dead. Determined not to make the same mistakes as in his past life, he sets out to take a more active role in this one, acting as the priest of Gracefeel, his guardian deity, and helping those in need as he travels the world. Mutsumi Okuhashi and Kanata Yanagino&#39;s The Faraway Paladin tells a truly original story, that not only has a magic system and world-building more interesting than most, but also explores uncommon yet profoundly impactful themes such as family.





 8  Overlord 
        

Fugin Miyama and Kugane Maruyama&#39;s Overlord follows an average office worker who simply wanted to enjoy the final moments of his favorite VRMMO, Yggdrasil, before the servers got shut down. However, much to his surprise, the destined time represented not an end, but rather a beginning, as he was trapped in the game&#39;s world, in the body of his skeletal character. In an attempt to understand this world and seek others who share his predicament, he becomes the villain his in-game followers believe him to be and sets out on an epic journey. Though the premise may sound familiar, this dark yet comedic title is thoroughly original and highly enjoyable.





 7  Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy 
        

Due to a contract made by his parents, Makoto Misumi is summoned to a magical world where humans and non-humans coexist. In most stories, this would be the beginning of an extraordinary journey and possibly the origin of a legendary hero, but that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth in his case, as this world&#39;s goddess decides to banish him to the wastelands on a whim, as she finds him unattractive and unfit for her world. Kotora Kino and Kei Azumi&#39;s Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy is a truly refreshing take on the genre, that stands out thanks to its emphasis on intriguing developments and realistic characters, including secondary ones.





 6  From Far Away 
        

Kyouko Hikawa&#39;s From Far Away is an award-winning isekai title published long before the genre became overwhelmingly popular. The story follows Noriko Tachiki, an ordinary high school student who is suddenly transported to a mysterious world much unlike her own, where soon finds herself in danger, facing powerful monsters. Thankfully, a wandering swordsman named Izark Kia Tarj comes to her aid. With nowhere else to go, Noriko decides to follow her savior and learn the world&#39;s language from him, unaware of the connection they have. Boasting realistic characters, beautiful romance elements, and an interesting world, this title remains one of the best in the genre, in spite of its age.





 5  So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? 
        

Isekai stories wherein normal humans are reincarnated as different beings have almost become their own subgenre, and Asahiro Kakashi and Okina Baba&#39;s So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? is one of the best examples thereof. As clearly indicated by the title, this story revolves around a girl who was reincarnated as a spider, waking up in a dungeon full of strange monsters and creatures that could easily overpower her. Having to rely on her wits and agility to survive, Kumoko develops battle tactics to defeat her foes and become stronger. While the unique premise may hook readers in, the heroine&#39;s progressive development is sure to keep them interested





 4  KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World! 
        

Any genre as popular as isekai is bound to receive parodies at some point, and KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World! is easily one of the best. Drawn by Masahito Watari and written by Natsume Akatsuki, also known for his work on Combatants Will Be Dispatched!, this title quickly rose to popularity thanks to its peculiar characters and slapstick comedy. The story revolves around an eclectic group, formed of Kazuma Satou, a reincarnated student, Aqua, a goddess, Lalatina Dustiness Ford, an unusual crusader, and Megumin, an archwizard who only knows one spell. Causing collateral damage everywhere they go, these adventurers are the type to inspire cautionary tales rather than heroic ones.

 3  Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun 
        

While Iruma Suzuki&#39;s parents have always been selfish and irresponsible, much to the dismay of this overly compliant boy, his life takes a drastic turn when they decide to sell him to Sullivan, a high-ranking demon. Being the only human in the Netherworld should be terrifying, but luckily for Iruma, his new grandfather proves to be doting and kind, helping him navigate this situation. Moreover, as a student of Babyls, he ends up befriending various demons, while hiding his identity. As a primarily comedic title, Osamu​​​​​​​ Nishi&#39;s Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun may not have the most complex story, but it always makes for a fun and enjoyable experience.





 2  That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime 
        

​​​​​​Taiki Kawakami and Fuse&#39;s That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is easily one of the most popular titles of the genre, and rightfully so. Typically, slimes are some of the weakest mobs in any fictional world, which explains why Rimuru should be disappointed when they wake up as one after being unceremoniously stabbed in their previous life. However, Rimuru is no ordinary slime, as they possess the ability to absorb others&#39; skills, as well as powers granted by Veldora Tempest, a legendary dragon they end up befriending. As such, a hectic journey awaits, full of memorable characters and intriguing developments, that no isekai fan should miss.





 1  The Saga of Tanya the Evil 
        

Chika​​​​​​​ Toujou​​​​​​​ and Carlo Zen&#39;s The Saga of Tanya the Evil revolves around the titular Tanya Degurechaff, who, due to her lack of faith in her past life, was forcefully reborn in a war-torn world by &#34;Being X&#34;, a godlike figure seeking to challenge her beliefs. Further defying Being X, Tanya joins the military intending to live in the back lines, away from the constant fights. However, thanks to her magical aptitude and strategic combat prowess, she proves to be an indispensable asset. Setting itself apart through its alternative historical setting and unique protagonist, this title proves to be genuinely original and captivating.
From humans who are transported to magical worlds, where they can fulfill the dreams they never could and live the fantastical lives they always dreamed of, to those who are reborn as strange new creatures, having to adapt to their new forms and raise their power level to ensure their survival, there are plenty of options when it comes to building an interesting and captivating isekai story. Regardless of which approach they chose, these stories stood the test of time and brought something new to the genre, making a name for themselves as some of the best isekai manga.
