## Literature Review

From grounded tales of friendship and drama, to supernatural ones with a comedic twist, the world of idol anime offers a surprising amount of variety.




Idol anime series are successful because they know how to capitalize on their medium. There are often debates regarding whether the manga/light novel version or the anime adaptation of a work is superior, but few would suggest that idol stories aren&#39;t right at home within the anime industry. After all, it is exactly this medium that allows for an emphasis on well-animated choreography and memorable songs to be valued.
With the rise in popularity of idol anime came a variety of series, each aiming to put its own spin on the theme. Some incorporate supernatural or Sci-Fi elements, some focus more on the personal wishes and struggles of the individual members, while others emphasize the competitive nature of the idol industry and inherent hardships. But they all have one thing in common: amazing music. Here are ten of the best.









 








 10  Zombie Land Saga (2018) 
Original Anime Series Produced By Studio MAPPA


 







A fully original award-winning anime, Zombieland Saga is a one-of-a-kind tale that follows a fascinating idol group formed of seven zombie girls. Although these girls originally lived in different time periods, they were all resurrected at the same time by one man, Koutarou Tatsumi, who seeks to revitalize the Saga prefecture. From getting used to their new zombie identities (which they must also hide from the public) to understanding and accepting the differences between their respective time periods and the present, the girls have a lot to deal with. However, their daily events are presented in a fun comedic manner, making this show a truly unique zombie anime.

 9  IDOLiSH7 (2018) 
Animated By Troyca &amp; Based on the Game By Bandai Namco
        

While female idol groups represent a relatively common theme in the anime landscape, their male counterparts are exceedingly rare. As it happens, IDOLiSH7 is one of the best examples of the latter. IDOLiSH7 follows seven boys and their inexperienced manager navigating the tough idol industry together. As expected of a show of its kind, there is a big emphasis on music, performance, and the bonding of the members. Yet what truly sets it apart is the constant focus on drama. None of the boys is a simple one-dimensional character, with each having realistic backstories and personal struggles that every viewer will find themselves empathizing with.

 8  AKB0048 (2012) 
Animated By Studio Statelight and Based on the Idol Group AKB48
        

Whereas most idol shows are more grounded in reality, AKB0048 is the only entry on this list to belong to the sci-fi anime genre. Its events take place in a world where, as a result of destructive interplanetary wars, humans were forced to flee Earth and relocate to other planets. However, these planets are led by totalitarian governments, that have banned all forms of art and entertainment. Enter eponymous AKB0048, a group inspired by the original J-Pop band AKB48, who seeks to change the world. They fight (often literally, as they are trained in combat) against these laws by holding guerrilla concerts across the universe and reminding people of the importance of art.





 7  The iDOLM@STER (2011) 
Animated By A-1 Pictures &amp; Based on the Video Game Franchise By Bandai Namco
        

As one of the early big franchises to bring idols into the anime limelight, The iDOLM@STER is a classic that quickly perfected the formula. The iDOLM@STER revolves around 13 idols making their way to the top, without any aspect of their journey being disregarded. From the countless hours of hard work that they must go through, to the stress and drama they inevitably experience, nothing is overlooked. Particularly noteworthy is the tension between their desire to become famous and the wish to spend time together, which are difficult to reconcile. It is clear that A-1 Pictures, known for other music anime like Your Lie in April, caught lightning in a bottle.
Though the original iDOLM@STER is unavailable on streaming, iDOLM@STER Side M is available on Crunchyroll. 






 6  Shine Post (2022) 
Animated By Studio Kai &amp; Based on the Franchise By Konami
        

As one of the more recent and lesser-known entries on this list, Shine Post is an unfortunate case of a show not receiving enough attention due to heavy seasonal competition. Its premise might seem unoriginal at first, as it follows an unsuccessful idol unit facing potential disbandment when a new manager comes in and turns things around for them. The title comes from Haru&#39;s (one of the group&#39;s idols) wish to become the shining guidepost that leads the world toward idols. In spite of its simple premise, however, Shine Post ends up being an exceptionally memorable experience, particularly bolstered by strong character writing and high production values.

 5  Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task (2022) 
Original Anime Series Created By Studio Lay-duce
        

It may not be evident from the title of this show, but Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is another entry on the short list of noteworthy male idol anime. The titular unpopular girl is first-year high school student Hiyori Suzumi, who moves from her small hometown to Tokyo to pursue her track and field dreams. Realizing that she needs a part-time job, she somehow ends up being a manager-in-training for LIPxLIP, an idol group that consists of two boys who also happen to be her classmates. What makes this an especially enjoyable watch are Hiyori&#39;s relentless efforts as well as her interactions with LIPxLIP.

 4  Selection Project (2021) 
Original Anime By Studio Doga Kobo


 







The titular Selection Project refers to a tough idol competition, best known as legendary idol Akari Amasawa&#39;s starting point. Akari inspired many fans, including Suzune Miyama, who had to spend most of her childhood bedridden due to her weak heart. This show follows Suzune doing her best to achieve her dreams of becoming an idol herself, by participating in the same competition as Akari once did. Thanks to the exceptional production quality, the well-written backstories, and the determination to show every girl&#39;s desires and struggles, this is one series absolutely worth watching. What&#39;s more, studio Doga Kobo also created Oshi no Ko, a brilliant title that explores the dark side showbiz world.

 3  Idoly Pride (2021) 
Animated By Studio Lerche &amp; Based on the Franchise By CyberAgent
        

Idoly Pride revolves around Kotono Nagase, a high school student determined to carry on her late sister&#39;s legacy by winning in the annual VENUS Grand Prix and becoming a top idol. In order to achieve her dreams, she must join 9 other aspiring idols and navigate the difficult world of idols. While her sister may have passed, Kotono embodies her drive, and her fellow group member, Sakura Kawasaki, has a nearly identical singing voice. Even among a plethora of idol anime, Idoly Pride manages to shine thanks to its unusual story, realistic and well-written characters, and brilliant animation and music.

 2  If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die (2020) 
Animated By Studio Eight Bit &amp; Based on the Manga By Auri Hirao
        

If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die is a truly unique show, as it places its focus not on the idols themselves, but rather on one of their most devoted fans. Eripiyo found Maina Ichii by chance and instantly fell in love with her music after attending a local concert. As Maina is rather shy and reserved despite being an idol, Eripiyo feels even more of a need to personally ensure that Maina and her underground idol group succeed. The highlight of this show is definitely the comedy that results from Eripiyo&#39;s relentless devotion - even at the cost of her own health.

 1  Love Live! School Idol Project (2013) 
Animated By Studio Sunrise &amp; Based on the Franchise By ASCII Media Works


 







Serving as many people&#39;s introduction to anime idol groups, Love Live! School Idol Project is the primary starting point of what became a huge multimedia franchise, including multiple anime series, manga, video games, and more. While the other series, set in the same universe, deserve just as much praise, the original needs to be commended, for nothing else would have existed without it. The show follows a group of high school students who decide to become idols in order to help their school, which faces the threat of shutting down due to not attracting enough new students. Little can be said about these legendary idols, that hasn&#39;t already been said. Ultimately, Love Live! is the best idol anime and probably will be for some time.
