## Literature Review

The weirdest anime on Crunchyroll will be more than just weird. They will flip notions and perspectives upside down. 




The weirdest anime on Crunchyroll can be found in any genre, from magical girl to mystery. They will not only turn heads and ask questions, but they will provide unique perspectives. The categorization of something as “weird,” can be tricky, as synonyms include words such as “uncanny” or “supernatural,” and the word has historically brought negative connotations.
For the sake of clarity and consistency, to call an anime weird should refer to its ability to make an audience reconsider what the norm is. It will make them uncomfortable, and it will often shed light on ideas that don’t frequently make it to the forefront of modern media. Most importantly, series that are weird for the sake of being weird simply fail to stand out compared to those that use their weirdness to challenge their viewers.









 








 10  Space Dandy Is the Standard for Intergalactic Irregularities 
Based on the manga by Park Sung-woo, Harada Masafumi, and REDICE
        

Space Dandy, produced by Studio Bones, first aired in 2014 and follows protagonist Dandy in his adventures through space with his trusty pompadour on his head and his vacuum cleaner robot, QT, and alien cat, Meow, by his side. The premise of this anime and Dandy’s occupation is that he is searching for the strangest aliens he can find for money.
This provides a massive springboard for the creative freedom of the creators to take a leap and curate the wackiest and most unimaginable collection of space critters in existence. This premise also makes Space Dandy a perfect anime for beginners of the genre. As many of Space Dandy’s production staff also worked on Cowboy Bebop, there is an added touch of artistic craftsmanship.

 9  Puella Magi Madoka Magica Provides an Unexpected Twist To Magical Girls 
Original series directed by Shinbo Akiyuki and Miyamoto Yukihiro


 







Puella Magi Madoka Magica begins as a typical magical girl series would, as protagonist Kaname Madoka awakens her powers via the supernatural cat, Kyuubey, but takes a quick and drastic turn. While the traditional magical girl anime will focus on pretty, sparkling, and marketable transformations, Madoka Magica revolutionized the Magical Girl genre by honing in on the grotesque nature of a magical world free of idealism.
Besides the twists and jabs at the magical girl genre, the series also digs into a unique strangeness in animation. The main enemies, the witches, are portrayed almost as psychedelic paper cutouts, which sharply contrasts the style of the rest of the Madoka Magica world.

 8  JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Is Indeed Bizarre 
Based on the manga by Araki Hirohiko


 







With a name like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, if the anime is not a wacky head-turner of a series, it would have long disappointed any potential fans. However, considering its notoriety, that was clearly not the case. First airing in 2012, JoJo’s follows the Joestar family, who are endowed with a slew of supernatural abilities, as they fight against the forces of evil through generations.
The anime faithfully adapts the manga and thus benefits from its unique structuring into parts, each following new members of the Joestar family and their enemies. This has allowed JoJo to stay fresh despite the franchise being almost 40 years old, and the anime has reflected that over the past decade. From phenomena like raining frogs to fighting Nazis with tequila, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is never without an exciting moment.

 7  Mononoke Reimagines Feudal Japan 
Original series directed by Nakamura Kenji
        

Mononoke is an original series produced by Toei Animation in 2007, and follows the “Medicine Seller” through feudal Japan as he performs exorcisms on evil spirits called “Mononoke.” However, what sets this series apart from typical exorcism series like Blue Exorcist and Jujutsu Kaisen is that Mononoke takes a turn from the battle shonen genre and enters the philosophical. The Medicine Seller performs strange rituals and analyses en route to the Form, the Truth, and the Reason, to ensure a successful exorcism. The art of Mononoke was also a fresh take on animation, as the scenes resemble moving paintings while exhibiting wild and vibrant colors.

 6  Punch Line is an Explosive Comedy 
Original series directed by Uemura Yutaka
        

Punch Line is an anime that dabbles in the occult and challenges universal time-axis rules, all the while being a comedy that doesn’t fail to garner laughter rooted in the absurd. The series follows Iridatsu Yuuta, who gains supernatural powers after his soul separates from his body, and he is left to the care of perhaps an overly anthropomorphized spirit cat named Chiranosuke.
The absurd premise of Yuuta’s powers is that he gains a Dragon Ball Z-esque powerup when he sees a girl’s panties. However, the series takes this silly fan-service premise and brings it to the next level. The caveat is, if Yuuta sees a second pair within a certain time span, the world will explode, bringing this anime’s wackiness to a climax.

 5  Odd Taxi Can Be Anything But Normal 
Original series directed by Kinoshita Baku


 







The world of Odd Taxi is already weird enough that stepping into a taxi driven by a human-sized walrus named Odokawa Hiroshi, who borderline resembles a gigantic stuffed animal, is considered absolutely normal. What’s more, the occupation of taxi driver just begs for shifty, eccentric, and flat-out weird characters to stop by. However, the series does not relent until the ideas of weirdness and unpredictability are pushed to the extreme. It turns out a missing girl is tracked to the quiet walrus, who is subsequently chased by the yakuza and corrupt cops. Finally, this perfect premise for oddity is sprinkled with a hint of mystery.

 4  Golden Boy Is a Realistic Slap of Weirdness 
Based on the manga by Egawa Tatsuya
        

Golden Boy is a raunchy classic that gives new understanding to perverseness in anime and redefines the transitional period of a young adult seeking personal development through travel and part-time work. The short series follows Ooe Kintarou as he rides across the country on his bike, putting his versatile expertise to the test. Where the strangeness comes in is whenever Kintarou meets women, leading to odd encounters such as the infamous scene where he slides in to intercept spit with his mouth, or a high-tension interaction with a woman and her motorcycle. With every episode, Kintarou’s antics stray further and further from the norm.

 3  FLCL Brings Confusion and Weirdness Together 
An original series directed by Tsurumaki Kazuya
        

FLCL, pronounced “Fooly Cooly,” is weird in all aspects of narrative, character development, and art style, as the anime follows a short and twisted story splashed with every type of chaos imaginable. FLCL follows a young boy named Nanbata Naota as he gets mixed up in a supernatural world that borders the realm of the imaginary after he meets the guitar-wielding, Vespa-riding Haruhara Haruko, who is after the powerful space pirate Atomsk in Naota&#39;s head. The series is also super-charged with sexual innuendos, while it is never truly about sex, and the end of the FLCL is weird enough to leave viewers wondering what just happened.

 2  Pop Team Epic Doesn’t Hold Back 
Based on the manga by Ookawa Bkub
        

The hit gag comedy, Pop Team Epic, is an anime that pushes the boundaries of sensibility, with protagonists Popuko and Pipimi cracking jokes that make fun of their own mediums and jokes that straight-up defy logic. The premise of this series is to create gag from the sheer nonsense of the situations, as a scene can exhibit clear direction at one point, but take a sharp but comedically-timed turn at the next second. Furthermore, Pop Team Epic’s art style draws from many Western styles and focuses on simplicity, adding an even stranger vibe to the already out-of-control comedy.

 1  Ghost Stories Creates Absurdity With Negligence 
Based on the novels written by Tsunemitsu Toru
        

Ghost Stories is a horror mystery anime that first aired in 2001 that weaves a relatively straightforward story, that is until the creation of the controversial English dub where the production staff were given full creative reign. This led to bizarre lines and situations that completely warped the meaning of entire episodes.
At times, creative suggestions were taken from the voice actors themselves, leading to gags that were either absurd, offensive, incoherent, and more. The dub was produced in 2005, and after more than a decade, Ghost Stories resurfaced to the modern eye. All of its ambiguity, insensitivity, and meme-able content is only available for streaming on Crunchyroll.
