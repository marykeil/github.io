## Literature Review

Netflix&#39;s newest adaptation of the Scott Pilgrim series is nearly here, promising to truly bring the popular graphic novel to life in animated form.




A month on since its initial reveal, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is about to arrive internationally on Netflix. Based on the popular graphic novels by Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley, fans have been eagerly expecting a return to the video game-styled action comedy, since an animated version can hew more closely to the original art style, while fully bringing out the magical realism of its vision of Toronto, Canada.





 What Time Scott Pilgrim Takes Off Releases 

 

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off comes out on Netflix on November 17. It will air internationally at 12 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 3 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) and 7 a.m. Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT). As a Netflix show, it will not be available on any other streaming service. Scott Pilgrim is scheduled to release eight episodes, which will have a runtime of approximately half an hour long each. Given Netflix&#39;s release structure, the whole season will be available all at once, rather than utilize a weekly release schedule to spread the episodes out.



 What is the Story of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off? 
          




Set in a fantastic version of Toronto, Canada, Scott Pilgrim follows the eponymous slacker and part-time musician as he strikes up a romance with the mysterious Ramona Flowers. Complicating the relationship, however, is the arrival of Ramona&#39;s &#34;Seven Evil Exes&#34;, who challenge Scott to defeat them all in order to continue dating her. The result is an increasingly absurd adventure, as Scott fights off the seven exes who all wield bizarre superpowers, all the while learning more about Ramona as well as himself. The inventive imagery and the use of video game elements also lends Scott Pilgrim its unique identity.



 How Will Scott Pilgrim Takes Off Differ From the Movie? 
          

Scott Pilgrim has already been adapted once as a 2010 live-action movie, titled Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Fans, however, are eager to see this new version: Science Saru, which is animating the series, has lent the show an art style closer that better resembles the original graphic novels. The eight episodes also provide breathing room that the story can use to expand on characterization and plot, something the movie had to hurry through. However, the voices of the characters are unmistakable, as the entire movie cast reprise their roles for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, which is only hours away.




Scott Pilgrim Takes Off can be viewed on Netflix on November 17, 2023.
