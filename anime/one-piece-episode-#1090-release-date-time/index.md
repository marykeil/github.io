## Literature Review

One Piece #1090 will finally show what Egghead Island looks like and introduce the Straw Hats to some of its inhabitants and its general theme.




One Piece has finally begun its much anticipated Egghead Island arc and episode #1090 is poised to reveal more of what this important arc is actually about. While the Straw Hats haven&#39;t even reached the titular island yet, episode #1089 revealed some very important lore details and also reintroduced a character who will likely be very important in this arc. Based on where episode #1089 ends this will likely make episode #1090 feel like a true beginning to the arc, potentially having the Straw Hats actually reach their destination.





 What Time One Piece Episode #1090 Releases 
          

One Piece episode #1090 will air on Sunday, January 14 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on January 13 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, January 14 at 3:00 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for One Piece fans in Europe. Fans of the English dub will have to wait for that version to premiere on Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Episode #1089 of One Piece? 
          

Episode #1089 began with the Straw Hats discussing their next steps forward, with Robin saying that the next Ponegliff may be the most difficult to find yet given that nobody knows where it is. The episode then reveals another piece of stunning lore information by cutting over to a call Sabo is making from Lulusia to the Revolutionary Army, confirming that he didn&#39;t kill King Cobra but also mentioning that he saw something unbelievable while there. Before he can mention what this is, a powerful (likely Ancient) Weapon destroys Lulusia. The episode ends with the Straw Hats sailing through a blizzard and picking up a childlike form of Bonny before a shark tries to eat the ship from below.






 One Piece Episode #1090 Will Finally Show Egghead Island 
          

Assuming the Straw Hats can escape from the shark unscathed, they will likely then interrogate Bonney about how she wound up in the ocean. After that, it is almost guaranteed based on the preview of episode #1090 that the Straw Hats will finally reach the futuristic Egghead Island. The wonderful new opening of the show has provided some hints as to what Egghead Island will be like, but it will be nice to see the location in One Piece&#39;s standard style as opposed to the more cartoonish feel of the opening. They also will likely meet some of the inhabitants of the island, which will also introduce the main conflict of the arc.

While the episodes between Wano and Egghead Island were all great, it will be exciting for the series to be more focused on the Straw Hats and their adventures again. In addition, it will be exciting to see the new looks the Straw Hats adopt on Egghead Island, as they generally change their outfits for each arc. Given how much the manga readers have hyped up Egghead Island if episode #1090 can live up to expectations when it airs on January 13 on Crunchyroll, it may introduce one of the best arcs in One Piece history.
