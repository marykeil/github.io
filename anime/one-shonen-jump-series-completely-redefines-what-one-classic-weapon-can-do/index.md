# One Shonen Jump Series Completely Redefines What One Classic Weapon Can Do


## SUMMARY 



  Kamihate&#39;s marksmanship skills with a gun have redefined what guns can do in Shonen Jump manga, showcasing innovative new ways to use firearms.   Unlike other characters in shonen series who rely on magical abilities, Kamihate&#39;s marksmanship skills are solely based on their own abilities, making them one of the best gun wielders in shonen manga.   Sakamoto Days breaks new ground in creating creative ways to use firearms, challenging the notion that supernatural powers are more effective and showcasing the unique abilities of Kamihate as Shonen Jump&#39;s best marksman.

## Literature Review

The Shonen Jump action manga Sakamoto Days has recently introduced a new character who completely redefines what a classic weapon can do.




Shonen Jump characters often fight in unique ways, but one new antagonist is completely redefining what a classic weapon can do. This is somewhat surprising given how many mangaka have previously put their own spin on this sort of fighting technique in the past. However, Sakamoto Days by Yuto Suzuki shows that there are still innovative new ways to use even the most common of weapons.




In the most recent chapters of Sakamoto Days, a new member of the manga&#39;s most elite assassin group, known as the Order, has appeared. This new member, Kamihate, is one of the best snipers in the world, to the point where they only communicate with others through shooting. This includes simple expressions of displeasure and more complicated messages transmitted through shooting syllables on a sheet of paper. They have also used their incredible abilities to destroy the laptop of someone trying to outbid them in an internet auction. These feats make them one of the best marksmen in all of manga and have redefined what guns can do in fiction.

Of course, Kamihate&#39;s extreme marksmanship skills put them in good company with many other weapons masters that have graced the pages of some iconic shonen action series. Many shonen series feature characters who can perform inhuman feats with a sword, such as Zoro from One Piece or Tanjiro from Demon Slayer. Some series have even extended this to things like bows and arrows, such as The Elusive Samurai which is set during a historical Japanese war. However, in many of these examples, characters are aided by magical abilities to make their feats even more impressive. Given Sakamoto Days&#39; slightly more realistic setting, Kamihate can&#39;t rely on this sort of crutch.




Given that Kamihate&#39;s marksmanship skills are all based on their own abilities, they are easily one of the best gun wielders in all of Shonen manga. This distinction is aided by the fact that many Shonen series don&#39;t heavily feature guns. There are many reasons for this, ranging from the fact that many Shonen series take place in settings without many guns and that oftentimes supernatural powers prove to be more effective than firearms. In addition, many times when a series does heavily feature guns, it is more realistic than Sakamoto Days and so its characters can&#39;t pull off the insane feats Kamihate can.

          

All of this allows Sakamoto Days to break new ground in creating creative new ways to use firearms. The series has previously innovated by using other weapons unusual to Shonen Jump like a saw with Osaragi and hammers with Shishiba, so it is only natural that another Order member would be able to innovate new ways to use a gun. As Sakamoto Days shows off even more of Kamihate in the future, their status as Shonen Jump&#39;s best marksman will likely be cemented even further as they continue to redefine what their weapon can do.
