## Literature Review

Solo Leveling&#39;s stellar opening episodes hint it could be on its way to becoming the next Attack on Titan, with more in common than fans think. 




Crunchyroll&#39;s most anticipated anime of the year, Solo Leveling, has finally made its debut, and it might even have the potential to be the next Attack on Titan. While the two stories seem wildly different on the surface, Solo Leveling&#39;s initial episodes suggest the two series may have more in common than fans think.




Solo Leveling&#39;s pilot episodes bears an uncanny resemblance to Attack on Titan&#39;s both thematically and structurally. The two series share many common elements, including their dystopian setting, and a similar premise of human warriors tasked with fighting monsters that threaten humanity. Both also feature stellar soundtracks composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, which adds to the feeling of déjà vu during Solo Leveling&#39;s double dungeon scene.

         

Additionally, both Attack on Titan and Solo Leveling captivate viewers with a fast-paced first episode where the narrative takes a surprisingly gruesome turn, spiraling into a nightmarish sequence of events that makes for a compelling, gripping introduction to each series.

                  Solo Leveling&#39;s Anime Makes a Big Change That Sets Up One of the Manhwa&#39;s Best Arcs   Solo Leveling makes one major change from the manhwa that teases the most crucial arcs of the series and sets the stage for Jinwoo&#39;s biggest feat.   





 Attack on Titan &amp; Solo Leveling&#39;s Protagonists Have Similar Roots 
          

While Jinwoo and Eren&#39;s character arcs follow very different trajectories, both characters share very similar origins. Both protagonists undergo immense growth inspired by a traumatic, life-threatening event that forces them to face their inherent weakness and strive to get stronger to protect those they love — a tried and tested trope in shonen media that never fails to be compelling.

In Eren&#39;s case, it is the Titans breaking through the wall and eating his mother in front of his eyes that inspires his journey, while for Jinwoo, it is getting trapped in the double dungeon and watching his fellow raid members die and betray him that causes the shift in his mentality. In fact, the paralyzing fear Jinwoo faces in the double dungeon isn&#39;t very different from Eren&#39;s horror at his mother&#39;s gruesome death, with both scenes evoking similar feelings of dread and trepidation.




                  Suicide Squad, One Piece, &amp; Solo Leveling: 2024&#39;s 10 Most Anticipated Anime   2024 promsies a robust catalogue of brand new anime to keep fans&#39; watch-lists full during the new year, including highly anticipated titles.   



 Jinwoo&#39;s Journey in Solo Leveling is Just as Spellbinding 
          

While Attack on Titan&#39;s initial success hinged primarily on the intrigue surrounding the Titans and the mystery of their origins, Solo Leveling&#39;s biggest mysteries lie in the source of Jinwoo&#39;s ability to level up and the origins of the peculiar messenger that offers him a second chance. Though the series may not come close to exploring the complex themes in Attack on Titan, Jinwoo&#39;s journey to the top certainly holds the potential to be just as gripping, akin to popular fantasy series like That Time I Reincarnated As A Slime and One-Punch Man which feature similar overpowered main characters and rich, immersive settings.




          

Overall, while Solo Leveling has only recently entered the scene, the series holds a lot of promise. The anime has quickly become a hit among long-time fans of the manhwa and new fans alike, its widespread success hinting it could very well grow to be Attack on Titan&#39;s potential successor and a mainstream classic.

Solo Leveling is available from Crunchyroll.
