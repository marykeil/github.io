Warning: Contains Content That May Be Upsetting. Reader Discretion AdvisedThe hit horror anime Another has some of the most disturbing death scenes fans can find in the medium. Originally debuting as a novel by author Yukito Ayatsuji, the anime adaptation drew immense popularity when it hit streaming services beginning in January 2012. It was a refreshing take on horror that merged mystery regarding a killing curse for a class of students with elements of Final Destination&#39;s most ridiculous deaths.

Another wasn&#39;t afraid to show off just how messed up it could be when it started killing off characters one by one. While some deaths in the series were quick, most featured imagery that was absolutely disturbing and gave fans nightmares for weeks. It&#39;s the most talked-about part of this hit anime because of how well executed they were, managing to burn the images into viewers&#39; brains for life. They make the perfect anime viewing for Halloween. Without further ado, here are the ten scariest deaths featured in Another, ranked by how disturbing they are.
            
 
 10 Best Hero Deaths in My Hero Academia 
While everyone dreams of being a pro hero in My Hero Academia, sometimes a hero must sacrifice their life. Here are 10 of MHA&#39;s best dead heroes.












 








 10  Jun Hamaguchi (Struck by Lightning) 
Episode 9: Body Paint
        

While not nearly as gory as some of the other kills in Another, this flashback death from a previous student of Class 3 still holds up as one of the series&#39; best. Jun Hamaguchi is barely a character in the show. In fact, his face is barely shown. However, his death sticks out more than most because of how disturbing it is. As he heads back from a shrine with his class following an attempt to put an end to the curse, he&#39;s suddenly struck by lightning. The way that he just drops like a rag doll as he dies is a haunting image as he easily kicks off this list with a brief but memorable kill.





 9  Kenzou Kawahori (Crushed by Pillar) 
Episode 12: Stand By Oneself
        

What makes this death stand out among others in the series is how it toys with the students before ultimately taking their life anyway. Kenzou Kawahori is one of four students who get a chandelier dropped on them as they try to escape the burning resort in the anime&#39;s big climax. However, he ends up being the only one to escape from under it. As he makes his way to the door with freedom in sight, a pillar collapses and crushes him. It&#39;s a heartbreakingly cruel death that shows just how relentless the Class 3 Curse is.





 8  Atsushi Ogura (Crushed by Construction Vehicle) 
Episode 9: Body Paint
        

One of the key reveals of the curse of Class 3 is that death is not just limited to the students. One of the most unsettling examples of this regards Yumi Ogura&#39;s brother, Atsushi. As he stays home on his computer, a construction vehicle plummets down the hill out of control. It crashes through the Ogura household and through his window, crushing him. Not only does the lifeless hand sticking out of the wreck and the blood pooling around it invoke pure terror, but the mere idea of something so quick happening without warning is enough to send chills up fans&#39; spines. This could happen to anyone, and with no way to prevent death from happening like this, it makes the idea far scarier that the curse could strike when the students least expect it.





 7  Junta Nakao (Head Injury and Boat Collision) 
Episode 8: Hair Stand
        

Another&#39;s subversive take on the clichéd beach episode ends in the only way this series does best: with a brutal death. However, it also doubles as one of its most disturbing. When Junta Nakao goes out to get a beach ball drifting into the ocean, there are a couple of times when it appears that he&#39;s drowned. However, when he&#39;s clearly not moving after two fake-outs, a boat hits him by mistake as the propellors spit him out. It&#39;s a gruesome death, and even though it turns out that he actually died from a fatal head injury he sustained while he was back in town, thus adhering to the rules of students only dying while still in Yomiyama, it&#39;s still a disturbing bit of overkill that will make anyone afraid to go in the water.





 6  Makoto Ouji (Explosion) 
Episode 11: Makeup
        

Turning back to Another&#39;s epic climax, Makoto Ouji joins the list with a haunting death scene. As he and one of his fellow students wait for the others to leave the resort, he opens the doors to the dining room where a fire has been building up. The flames quickly engulf him as a large explosion occurs, killing him instantly. However, what makes this scene remarkably disturbing is his charred corpse. He&#39;s shown to have hit a beam after being blown back by the explosion. Slowly, he limps down with a gust of steam escaping from him. It&#39;s a horrifying sight that makes it one of the scariest non-gory deaths in the anime.





 5  Takako Sugiura (Accidental Hanging) 
Episode 11: Makeup
        

During the chaos in the resort, students have been instructed to kill Mei Misaki in hopes of putting an end to the curse once-and-for-all as they believe she is the &#34;extra&#34; student. One of these assassins is Takako Sugiura as she desperately tries to kill Mei on the stairway. However, as she lunges forward, she accidentally gets caught in a series of wires, hanging herself. The way she&#39;s shown from the waist down violently thrashing around is incredibly disturbing to watch. It&#39;s also a perfect example of just how chaotic the final act became to the point of students dying off of their own accord.





 4  Izumi Akazawa (Impaled by Glass Shards) 
Episode 12: Stand By Oneself
        

The last major student death in the series, Izumi was set up as one of the big bads during the climax. She&#39;s the reason why people were hunting after Mei and Kouichi, so the fact she got one of the best deaths is also fairly satisfying. As she fights against Kouichi trying to kill him, a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder shatters the window they&#39;re near. The glass shards impale Izumi, ending her life just as she realizes that Kouichi isn&#39;t the &#34;extra&#34; student. It&#39;s a remarkably gruesome way to go but also a good way to put an end to the series&#39; main antagonist.





 3  Sanae Mizuno (Crushed in Freefalling Elevator) 
Episode 4: Put Flesh
        

The second death in the anime wasn&#39;t afraid to continue its gruesome deaths with a situation that will make viewers never want to ride elevators again. Sanae Mizuno, a nurse at the hospital Kouichi stayed at, informs him of the story behind the Class 3 curse. However, she herself is doomed as it turns out she has a sibling in said classroom. During a phone call with Kouichi, the elevator she&#39;s riding on suddenly goes into freefall when the cables snap, sending her to her death as she smacks against the ground and the rubble collapses on her. Elevator crashes are a very real thing, and to see it displayed here in such gruesome detail makes it one of the most horrifying moments in the series.

The latest chapter of Choujin X by mangaka Sui Ishida of Tokyo Ghoul fame broke its hero&#39;s mind with an absolutely disgusting death.








 2  Shōji Kubodera (Stabs Self) 
Episode 7: Sphere Joint
        

At first glance, a death as simple as homeroom teacher Shōji Kubodera&#39;s makes one question why it ranks among Another&#39;s most gruesome. However, the presentation is what makes it so disturbing. Following the killing curse&#39;s beginning, Kubodera loses his mind and decides to die by his own hand rather than let the curse overcome him. What he does though is absolutely traumatic as he stabs himself in front of his class, bleeding all over the front row of students. It&#39;s a shocking moment that rightfully scares the class, and it&#39;s a moment that has burned in the mind of viewers since the episode premiered.





 1  Yukari Sakuragi (Impaled by Umbrella) 
Episode 3: Bone Work
        

Out of all the deaths in Another, none have been able to rival the very first kill in the anime. Yukari Sakuragi is told something that makes her hurry to leave school early. However, as she heads down the stairs, she slips and tumbles down. As she reaches the bottom though, her umbrella opens up and impales her neck with the pointy end, killing her instantly. It&#39;s shocking, gruesome, and completely sets the stage for how relentless the anime would get. It&#39;s a perfect first kill after a slow start and hooks patient viewers for an exciting horror series.
These deaths are the very reason why Another has stood the test of time as one of the best horror anime. The mystery surrounding the class&#39; curse keeps the storyline fresh while balancing it with intense kills to maintain stakes. These disturbing deaths give Another its own sense identity and elevate it as a must-watch for any fan of the medium.
