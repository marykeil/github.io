## Literature Review

The Fourth Shinobi War had a major impact on Naruto’s conclusion, but few could have known its influence would also affect an important Boruto event.





During the Fourth Shinobi War, Orochimaru&#39;s assistant Kabuto offered his services to Akatsuki&#39;s leader Tobi. Having finally perfected the Edo Tensei jutsu, Kabuto was able to resurrect dead shinobi, all of whom would be under his explicit control. To accomplish a resurrection, all Kabuto needed was the DNA of the shinobi to be resurrected and a body or vessel for the resurrected shinobi&#39;s spirit to possess. DNA could be obtained from the biological material of the shinobi - such as from the bones of his buried skeleton. Naturally, with the remains of so many great shinobi easily accessible in graveyards scattered across the Five Nations, Kabuto did his level best to resurrect as many great ninjas as possible.





 Why Didn&#39;t Kabuto Bring Back Jiraiya? 
          

If Kabuto could form a resurrected &#34;shinobi dream team&#34;, the chances for Akatsuki&#39;s success in the Fourth Shinobi War would have increased significantly. However, while he was able to bring back a number of stellar warriors, including Madara Uchiha, the one person he did not bring back was Jiraiya - one of the greatest shinobi of his generation. The in-story explanation for this glaring absence was that Kabuto was not able to locate Jiraiya&#39;s body, and so could not obtain the DNA necessary for his resurrection. This is a plausible argument, especially when considering the circumstances of Jiraiya&#39;s death.

 : Naruto&#39;s Sequel Shows The Dark Legacy Of The Shinobi World War

In an interview, Naruto and Boruto creator Masashi Kishimoto explained Jiraiya&#39;s absence among the resurrected shinobi by stating that he did not think he could write a resurrection story that would be worthy of Jiraiya&#39;s impact and influence on the story prior to his death. Jiraiya’s death was a big part of Naruto’s development and brought him closer to understanding Sasuke’s feelings, so bringing Jiraiya back would undo that. However, years later, after the peace that the conclusion of Fourth Shinobi World War brought, a character named Koji Kashin appeared in Boruto. It turned out that Koji is a clone of Jiraiya, and while the exact details of his creation are still a bit fuzzy; what is known is that his creator Amado Sanzu, somehow had access to Jiraiya&#39;s DNA, proving that the cloning process and Edo Tensei essentially have the same requirements.






 Jiraiya&#39;s Low Key Return To The Narutoverse 
          

Koji&#39;s existence in Boruto provides great in-story support for Kabuto&#39;s claim that he couldn&#39;t find Jiraiya&#39;s body, something that seemed quite odd at the time, closing that open-ended story loop. Moreover, it also established a major plot twist in Boruto. Since Boruto is the sequel to Naruto there will naturally be some continuity between the two stories. In the case of Jiraiya, it also turns out that being a sequel can provide the opportunity to use Boruto to clear up loose ends and extend events in Naruto. Koji&#39;s story in Boruto is sadly under-developed, despite the fact that it had the potential to bring back a beloved Naruto character, but there&#39;s still the possibility of a re-occurring role for Jiraiya&#39;s clone in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.




Naruto and Boruto are now available from Viz Media.
