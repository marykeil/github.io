## Literature Review

Goku&#39;s battle against Gas just unlocked his ultimate form - a reimagined version of Ultra Instinct that allows him to fully tap his emotions.




A new, improved version of Ultra Instinct made its debut in the previous arc of Dragon Ball Super, and this powerful transformation may be Goku&#39;s strongest form ever. The series has recently been moving away from the classic Super Saiyan variations that made its predecessor Dragon Ball Z so famous, to focus on Goku and Vegeta&#39;s unique brands of divine ki, Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego. Both Saiyan warriors needed to evolve quickly to stand a chance against Gas, the strongest fighter in the universe, and it seems that Goku was successful, debuting a new version of Ultra Instinct.




Ultra Instinct was originally taught to Goku by Whis, an Angel, who explained that this technique separates the consciousness from the body, allowing it to move and fight independently of thoughts and emotions. Angels are constantly in this state, which is recognized as a properly divine technique, one that could make the user unbeatable.

          

Goku achieved this transformation in the fight against Jiren due to being backed against a wall, but has since been unable to control it, having a hard time fully repressing his emotions. Even after obtaining Perfected Ultra Instinct, Goku has been unable to maintain that form for long due to the extreme toll on his body. In the fight against Gas, both Ultra Instinct and Vegeta&#39;s Ultra Ego seemed useless against the warrior&#39;s overwhelming power, obtained through a wish to the Dragon Balls, so Goku and Vegeta were forced to push past their limits once again.





 Goku&#39;s Ultimate Form is Fueled By His Emotions 
          

In Dragon Ball Super chapter 85, the Prince of Saiyans is the first to fight Gas, and his Ultra Ego form&#39;s ability to become more powerful the more damage he takes seems to finally have an effect, but Vegeta collapses right after reaching his maximum power. In classic Dragon Ball tradition, however, he bought enough time for Goku to prepare, allowing him to meditate on the best way to use Ultra Instinct. Goku finally figures it out when he realizes that he will never be able to use the same Ultra Instinct the Angels do, which requires complete calm and a tranquil heart. So, Goku transforms into his own form of Ultra Instinct, which does not have the trademark silver hair. Rather than being calm, in this state Goku makes use of his emotions and turns them into strength, finally overpowering Gas.




Goku&#39;s new version of Ultra Instinct completely flips the original concept of obtaining a state of absolute calm and an empty mind. This was actually a major drawback, because Goku&#39;s power was too influenced by his emotions, as proved during the fight against Granolah when Ultra Instinct&#39;s accuracy decreased due to Goku&#39;s confusion. However, this new form completely erases this weakness and turns it into a strength: Goku&#39;s emotions become his fuel, allowing him to reach unprecedented levels of power. This transformation was foreshadowed by Goku&#39;s father, Bardock, who used it unconsciously against Gas when the two fought in the past. It appears, however, that the other limitation of Ultra Instinct, its limited duration, is still present, as Goku himself says in the chapter.



 What New Power Lies Ahead for Goku? 
          




Since the debut of this form in chapter 85, it has yet to appear again, with the manga instead focusing on the earthbound characters in an adaptation of the plot of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero. Not long after Goku debuted this new form, though, Frieza appeared and demonstrated his own new power-up, Black Frieza. Goku will have to master this new form if he&#39;s to stand a chance against this iteration of Frieza, or perhaps even find yet another step beyond, akin to the distinction between Ultra Instinct Sign and True Ultra Instinct.

While it might seem like Goku is nearing his peak, the series has always found a way to push past its apparent limits and debut newer and stronger forms. So long as Goku has powerful opponents to aspire to beat, he&#39;s likely to continue discovering new forms, each with their own unique quirks and variations. With his newfound affiliation with gods and Angels in Dragon Ball Super, there&#39;s no shortage of powerful beings who can help him reach new frontiers, whether that&#39;s through guidance like Whis, or opposition like Frieza.




The true nature of Ultra Instinct and the full extent of its power have yet to be explored in the series. It could be that the &#34;calm mind&#34; Whis described was only a requirement to unlock this power, and then each user can develop it in their own way, just like Vegeta&#39;s Ultra Ego is his own version of a God of Destruction&#39;s power. Either way, considering that Gas expressed the wish to become the strongest warrior in the universe, and Goku&#39;s new Ultra Instinct just made him stronger than Gas, this new transformation is without a doubt the most powerful form that Goku ever achieved in the history of Dragon Ball.
