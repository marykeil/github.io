# A Major Anime Confirms the Limits of its Premise With One Episode


## SUMMARY 



  The training montage in episode 7 of Shangri-La Frontier is boring and poorly executed, with still images and narration instead of actual fights.   The inclusion of these fights in the narrative is unnecessary and irrelevant, as they lack tension and are not fully animated.   The comedy elements and character interactions in Shangri-La Frontier are more engaging and enjoyable than the fighting sequences, highlighting the game&#39;s lack of meaningful combat.

## Literature Review

Shangri-La Frontier&#39;s most boring section of episode 7 is what happens when the story tries to take its video game setting seriously.




Sunraku&#39;s adventure in Shangri-La Frontier, which is currently streaming on Crunchyroll, suffers when it tries to follow the classic &#34;power growth&#34; storyline. The training montage that occurred in the seventh episode is by far one of the most boring and joyless sequences, and it feels like even C2C&#39;s animators were half-heartedly working on it. Regardless of the stakes, it&#39;s hard to take any video game setting seriously.




The meat of the episode involves Sunraku&#39;s return to Rabituza to continue its unique quest chain. This involves fighting a variety of monsters, but the resulting montage seems to exist only to fill space and use up everyone&#39;s patience, in and out of the universe. It&#39;s a highly questionable choice when an anime can&#39;t do much besides tell rather than show.

 Shangri-La Frontier Sags When It Takes Itself Seriously 
         

Truly, the training montage in episode 7 is one of the most anemic. Sunraku is challenged to fight a variety of monsters in the Vorpal Arena, but the way it is presented is problematic: an extended pan over a series of still images, while Sunraku narrates the process of killing them all. The monsters clearly aren&#39;t important, nor are the fights, yet everyone - Sunraku, the animators, and the audience - is obligated to sit and listen not to a fight, but to an idea of a fight that&#39;s being rushed through to completion. It was a waste of time and effort.




Training arcs are hard to pull off as the plot is stuck in place with fights that nominally have no danger. While other stories try to reintroduce some tension with time limits or real chances of death, Shangri-La Frontier&#39;s sequence lacks both. If the fights only engender boredom, there really should have been no point in including them due to their narrative irrelevance. But because the story is about Sunraku&#39;s epic quest to find and kill the video game boss Lycagon, the plot has to catalog every single experience point he grinds.

There&#39;s still an argument to be made that Shangri-La shines in its comedy. Gags like Rei squealing at her bird-headed crush while donning the heavy plate of her Psyger-0 avatar make better use of the possibilities of virtual reality gaming. Meanwhile, Sunraku&#39;s Sisyphean grind has no stakes in a world where fighting has no meaning, made all the more evident in how the anime feels as bored by the combat as the audience does. Shangri-La Frontier&#39;s narrative misstep shows how, despite the emphasis on gaining power, the fighting and numbers game still remains the least interesting part of an MMO.




Shangri-La Frontier is currently available on Crunchyroll.
