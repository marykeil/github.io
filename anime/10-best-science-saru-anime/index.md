 9  Lu Over The Wall Is A Classic Love Story 
Written by Masaaki Yuasa and Reiko Yoshida
        

The eponymous Lu is a ningyo, a fish-like creature from Japanese mythology. When she is given human legs by the music of lonely guitarist Kai, the two become fast friends as Kai introduces her to the human world. But when the small coastal town turns on Lu, it’s up to Kai and Lu to prevent an all-out catastrophe among their people.
After the success of Night is Short, Science SARU was quick to enter a contender into the ranks of having one of the best mermaid movies. The movie&#39;s fairly formulaic plot was bemoaned by some critics, who wished that Yuasa&#39;s imagination had extended to the story as well as the animation. However, that animation alone is beautiful enough to make it worth a watch.

 8  Ride Your Wave Inspires Viewers To Meet Life Head-On 
Written by Reiko Yoshida


When surfer Hinako and firefighter Minato meet and instantly hit it off on a picturesque beach, it seems like fate for them to be together. But the love they could have had is cut short when Minato drowns, saving someone else. Left alone, Hinako must learn how to accept life’s twists and turns and move forward.
Rather than the high-energy fantasy that Science SARU is largely known for, Ride Your Wave is a grounded romantic drama. For Yuasa, the seed of the plot was about how life has to be approached like &#34;riding a wave&#34;. Viewers are drawn in by pristine ocean animation, and held by the story of how even brief meetings can change people forever.
