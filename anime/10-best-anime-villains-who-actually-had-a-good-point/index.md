## Literature Review

Many anime villains actually have a good point behind their nefarious plans and the trouble they cause for the heroes.




Rare though they may be, there are several anime villains who actually had a good point. Though their actions are antagonistic towards the heroes, they have a legitimate problem that they’re trying to solve or their actions benefit others considerably. Often, they aim to change a troubled society completely.
The most common problem with this sort of character is that even if the villain has a valid point, their actions are just too horrendous to be justified. As such, whatever point they were trying to make or positive change they were trying to enact is lost, and the heroes never get back around to solving the original problem. These characters work best in a show with writing complex enough to handle them properly.









 








 10  Lady Eboshi Improved Many Lives Founding Iron Town 
Princess Mononoke


 







Lady Eboshi is the direct cause of most of Ashitaka and San’s problems over the course of the movie. By shooting Nago, she gets Ashitaka cursed and dooms his dying tribe. Her razing of the forest for Iron Town’s resources slowly but surely destroys the spirits guarding the land, including San’s mother Moro and the Deer God himself, the latter of whom Eboshi personally shoots, nearly getting everyone in range of its raging body killed.
However, to the residents of Iron Town, Eboshi is a lifesaver who has fairly earned their love and loyalty, caring for the downtrodden and ostracized of society. Princess Mononoke’s ending carries a message not of nature prevailing, but of nature managing to exist even in an increasingly technology-based society. As such, Eboshi and Iron Town survive, still steadily continuing the inevitable move away from nature and toward industrialization.

 9  Scar Was Right To Fight The Amestrian Military 
Fullmetal Alchemist
        

Scar is one of the strongest characters in Fullmetal Alchemist, and the scourge of State Alchemists everywhere. Full of rage and grief after the war of extermination Amestris waged on his country, Ishval, he slaughters everyone he believes is responsible for the massacres, with innocents like the Rockbells and Edward caught in the crossfire. Ultimately, Scar lets go of his anger and commits to a path of peace and restoration for his people.
However, Scar is a genocide survivor with a legitimate grudge against many of his targets, who were war criminals never punished for their atrocities. If not for Scar, they would not only have gotten off scot-free but possibly created a bigger problem for our heroes when they turned on the government. Roy and Riza also believe that they deserve consequences for all the innocents they killed, accepting that their plan to overturn Amestris’ military dictatorship will also likely result in their being tried and executed.

 8  Chouji Suitengu Destroys The Corrupt Wealthy 
Speed Grapher
        

The world of Speed Grapher is a vicious one, and nobody knows that better than Suitengu. On the surface, he appears to be no better than the sleazy rich people he caters to at his shady nightclub. But in his heart, he detests all of them, having lost his parents, witnessed the irreparable trauma of his abused little sister, and being forced to become a mercenary as a child all because of the whims of the upper class.
Typically, tanking the economy of an entire country would be a horrific act. But when Suitengu finally goes through with one of the greatest revenge plots in anime, to burn the upper classes to the ground by destroying all their money and assets, willing to die himself if it means success, it feels well deserved. The epilogue even goes out of its way to show that Japan is better off for what Suitengu did.

 7  Sasuke Uchiha Had Legitimate Issues With Konoha 
Naruto


 







Sasuke has always been prepared to sacrifice himself for his ideals, which on the surface is noble, but in practice sends him down a massive spiral over the course of the series. After discovering that the Hidden Leaf Village itself is responsible for Itachi’s massacre of their clan, he turns his hatred on them. After a little more reflection, he decides to become Hokage instead, creating peace using Itachi’s method of shouldering the world’s hatred alone.
While his approach is unstable and his way of ruling is as likely to end in failure as Nagato’s, Sasuke isn’t wrong about either his grudge against the village or about the shinobi system. From Tobirama to Danzo to Hiruzen, the Uchiha clan was discriminated against and punished for crimes they didn’t commit. Naruto, for all his promises, defeats many external threats but doesn’t actually do much to right the wrongs baked into the shinobi world.

 6  Shougo Makishima Takes On A Dystopian System 
Psycho Pass
        

The best episodes of Psycho Pass clearly show the drawbacks of the Sibyl System, which judges and punishes people not for what they’ve done, but for the crimes they might potentially commit. Akane, Kogami, and the other heroes are Enforcers keeping the populace in line according to this system. Shougo Makishima, despite being criminally asymptomatic according to the Sibyl System, delights in being one of the country’s most wanted criminals and accomplished anarchists.
However, for all the valid points that can be made about how the Sibyl System does more harm than good, Makishima doesn’t actually have a better replacement. He also believes that humans are nothing but their darkest impulses, he just responds to that with vicious destruction rather than a harsh, punishing attempt at order. Just because the heroes don’t have any plans to overturn a corrupt system anytime soon, doesn’t mean the villain’s plan is any better.

 5  Knives Millions Has A Strong Sense Of Self-Preservation 
Trigun Stampede
        

To both the humans of No Man’s Land and his long-suffering brother Vash, Knives is the greatest threat on the planet. A powerful Plant, Knives detests all humans and devotes his life to destroying them completely. This, of course, horrifies Vash, who is equally devoted to finding his place among humanity no matter the cost to himself, and his human friends.
However, Knives’ rage about the other, more helpless Plants being tormented and used up until their deaths by humans is plenty understandable. Stronger inside him is his terror of being overpowered and used himself; both are made a lot clearer in the remake TrigunStampedethan in the original 1998 anime. Because the planet’s humans rely on drawing energy from Plants to eke out their living, even when they’re not going the extra mile to experiment on them, coexisting is easier said than done.

 4  Su-Won Is A Better King Than His Uncle 
Yona Of The Dawn
        

Su-won’s sweet and gentle exterior hiding the violence he is truly capable of isn’t exactly one of the most shocking episode one plot twists in anime. Through the horrified Yona and furious Hak’s eyes, he is playing out the classic “bitter non-heir usurps the throne, displaces the rightful rulers, and ruins the kingdom” story when he murders his uncle King Il. Except that Su-won is actually quite a good king.
What’s more, Su-won claims to also be avenging the death of his father Yu-hon, whom he saw Il kill in cold blood himself. Though Yona understandably cannot forgive him for killing her beloved father, she also acknowledges that there’s a lot she doesn’t know about their family, and that Il’s overly permissive style of ruling wasn’t any better than Yu-hon’s bloodthirst and constant aggression. Su-won is a good diplomat who&#39;s legitimately devoted to making his kingdom a better place as ruler.

 3  Stain Accurately Points Out Unheroic Heroes 
My Hero Academia
        

Before Deku and company face off with the League of Villains, they fight Chizome Akaguro, A.K.A. Hero Killer Stain. Stain’s Quirk is to paralyze anyone whose blood he gets a lick of, and he stalks the city with plenty of knives to acquire said blood. He will kill not only other villains, but any heroes who don’t measure up to his exacting standards of goodness, based on his idol, All Might.
As awful as Stain is, he’s not actually wrong when he points out that heroes who are truly selfless and heroic are few and far between, due to their career’s fame and glorification. Hero society allows domestic abusers like Endeavor to get away with their crimes because they’re good at their jobs, and conscripts children like Hawks into hero life for their Quirks. Even Iida is horrified to realize that, when Stain calls him selfish for focusing on taking revenge on him instead of helping the hero he’s currently brutalizing, he’s right.

 2  Kyubey Is Trying To Save The Universe 
Puella Magi Madoka Magica


 







This smiley little cat-thing has earned himself the pure hatred of anime fans everywhere since 2011. He lures teenage girls into irreversible contracts granting them one wish, which always backfires anyway, in exchange for a lifetime of service as magical girls, which by nature always ends horrifically. What’s more, he deliberately avoids telling them about the drawbacks until he’s convinced them to take the deal, at which point it’s too late.
However, he and his species aren’t doing all this for kicks: the energies gained by the creation of magical girls and witches help stave off the heat death of the universe. Madoka ultimately agrees that the problem Kyubey’s people are trying to solve can’t be ignored: her solution is just to sacrifice herself to solve it instead of vulnerable other children.

 1  Jinpachi Ego Successfully Makes Japan&#39;s Strikers Stronger 
Blue Lock


Most sports anime extol the virtues of loving and believing in your teammates and valuing personal growth and effort over victory. Ego and the Blue Lock program not only look down their noses at such things, but throw them directly in the trash. If Blue Lock can be said to have an antagonist at all, it would be Ego, whose method of creating the best striker in Japan is to throw hundreds of young talents in a pressure cooker and take the last one standing.
For all of Ego’s cold and calculating behavior, no one can say it hasn’t changed its participants. Over and over again, Isagi is awed and empowered by how Blue Lock’s do-or-die challenges force him and the other strikers to evolve, becoming stronger than they ever thought possible. Even seeing their friends eliminated only steels their resolve to win.
