## Literature Review

Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter #1 sets itself apart from other recent Sonic comics with its many references to actual zones from the games.




Spoilers for Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter #1The debut issue of IDW Publishing&#39;s Sonic the Hedgehog miniseries documenting Fang the Hunter&#39;s quest for the rumored legendary eighth Chaos Emerald puts an unprecedented amount of emphasis on levels from classic Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games. Although heavily connected to the franchise&#39;s gaming universe, IDW&#39;s main continuity doesn&#39;t usually feature key places from the games, except for special issues, like its very Infinity War-esque 30th anniversary one-shot. Fang the Hunter is clearly remedying this oversight.




So far, Sonic &amp; Knuckles&#39; Mushroom Hill Zone is fully explored and Sonic the Hedgehog&#39;s Marble Zone is mentioned in Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter #1 by writer Ian Flynn, penciler Mauro Fonseca, inker Rik Mack, colorist Valentina Pinto and letterer Shawn Lee.

          

Although Marble Zone is only mentioned, Sonic and Tails rush there halfway through the issue, implying that a future installment will take place in the lava-filled ruins. And if the issue&#39;s coverage of Mushroom Hill Zone is any indication, whatever transpires in Marble Zone will be a treat. A generous portion of Fang the Hunter #1 is dedicated to playing off the former level&#39;s most ubiquitous feature - the bouncy eponymous mushrooms - that moves the story and the ensuing battle along in creative ways.




                  13 Greatest Sonic the Hedgehog Stories of All Time   Here are the 13 best arcs, sagas, and overarching plot points from both IDW&#39;s ongoing and Archie Comics&#39; discontinued Sonic the Hedgehog series.   


 Fang the Hunter Captures the Best of Sonic &amp; Knuckles&#39; Mushroom Hill Zone 


          



          



Fans who are familiar with Sonic &amp; Knuckles&#39; Mushroom Zone will undoubtedly appreciate the additional little subtle details that the comic&#39;s creators sneak into the issue. Knuckles actually resorts to using the same lever his gaming counterpart pushes and pulls repeatedly to blow Sonic and/or Tails into another section of the level. In the comic, Knuckles uses it to ensnare one of Fang&#39;s companions. Another trap Knuckles successfully unleashes on Fang&#39;s team is clearly inspired by the switch that Knuckles jumps on to access his secret chamber in the game.






 Recent Sonic Comics Have Not Featured Many Game Levels 
          

Fang the Hunter&#39;s incorporation of classic Sonic levels is clearly the most comprehensive of any other release from IDW&#39;s Sonic comic line. Apart from a few minor exceptions that are explicitly based on a new gaming release, like the Team Sonic Racing one-shot, the Sonic the Hedgehog 30th Anniversary Special is the only notable one-shot that incorporates random levels from games that the issue isn&#39;t directly associated with. Strangely, the only game zone that does appear in the anniversary special - Mushroom Hill Zone - isn&#39;t actually labeled like the rest are.

Fang the Hunter&#39;s creative choice to directly reference classic games is therefore even more unexpected, since it&#39;s been marketed as the prequel story to the new game Sonic Superstars, and levels from that recent release have yet to be featured in this prequel miniseries. Many fans are likely excited about Fang the Hunter because it&#39;s exploring the potentially lore-shattering existence of an eighth Chaos Emerald. But the fact that Fang the Hunter&#39;s debut issue not only references but greatly draws upon various levels from classic Sonic the Hedgehog games makes the miniseries even more enjoyable.
