One Piece episode #1080, titled &#34;A Celebration Banquet! The New Emperors of the Sea!&#34; will air on Sunday, October 22 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 21 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, September 17 at 3:00 a.m. British Summer Time (BST) for One Piece fans in the UK.

 What Happened in Episode #1079 of One Piece? 
          

Episode #1079 largely focused on the fallout of the liberation of Wano and Kaido&#39;s defeat. In Wano, this is a cause for celebration, as the country moves on from the oppressive rule of its former tyrants and sets about to memorialize their victory and honor those who fell in the fighting. Once all the Straw Hats have recovered from their injuries they too take some time to celebrate, relaxing in a bathhouse with their friends from Wano. Outside the land of the Samurai, the Five Elders learn of Kaido and Big Mom&#39;s defeat and recognize that Nika has returned. In order to deal with the issue, the navy sends the powerful admiral Ryokugyu, meaning another fight for Wano&#39;s freedom is soon approaching.






 One Piece Episode #1080 Will Feature a Fight Against Ryokugyu 
          

With Ryokugyu heading to Wano, it is almost certain that the admiral will arrive in episode #1080 to try and place the country under the control of the World Government now that Kaido is out of the picture. This will likely be a tough battle given the average strength of a marine admiral. While One Piece anime fans haven&#39;t yet seen what Ryokugyu can do specifically, if he is on the same power level as admirals Fujitora, Kizaru, and Aokiji, then he will be a force to be reckoned with. In addition, the Straw Hats are still recovering from the Raid on Onigashima, which might make them a bit weaker than usual despite the various power-ups they got in that arc.

Luckily the Straw Hats will also have the people of Wano on their side for that fight, so the battle may not be that much of an issue. That includes Yamato, the powerful son of Kaido who asked Luffy to join his crew. This would be a great transition into the next arc of the series and mark an end to one of the longest sagas in the anime&#39;s history. Whether episode #1080 begins a new era of One Piece or not, it will still be exciting to watch given it will likely reveal a new major threat for the Straw Hats to deal with.
