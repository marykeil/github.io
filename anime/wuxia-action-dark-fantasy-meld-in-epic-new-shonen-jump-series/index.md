## Literature Review

Shonen Jump’s newest, Jiangshi X, pits a trio of young, fierce, and untested heroes against a devilish opponent with magical powers.





Jiangshi X follows the story of Xiaohu, Chaoyun and Jiuli, three young boys training to become Daoshi monks. Up until now, the three have always trained together, and have become rather skilled in martial arts. However, their tendency to joke around, play pranks, and try to outdo one another has hampered their abilities and opportunities to improve themselves and rise higher in the training ranks. One day, as the three are put to a group challenge that requires them to defeat a jiangshi – a zombie-like beast with magical powers. Defeating the jiangshi results in an upgraded rank, however, although the three must work as a team, only one will move up if they succeed.




                  Shonen Jump Tackles the Harsh Realities of Bullying in Brutal New Manga   The Ichinose Family’s Deadly Sins is not about bullying but its graphic depiction draws focus to its presence and effect in Japanese youth culture.   


 Jiangshi X Reimagines The Wuxia Genre 
          

Wuxia refers to an age-old Chinese literary tradition involving stories of martial arts heroes, who are often itinerant warriors or individuals training to be warriors. Often traveling the lands in search of spiritual growth or to escape some bad situation, these heroes are drawn into whatever controversy they come across while on their quest. Volunteering to help the downtrodden and vulnerable is a bedrock element of the classic wuxia hero. The controversies often include corrupt tyrants vicious criminals, or repressive wealthy elites. Defeating these villains often requires the heroes to put their skill to the test. It is clear that Jiangshi X is drawing from all these elements to produce a unique but recognizable tale, told with the traditional artistry of a superhero manga series.






 Jiangshi X Might Be Shonen Jump&#39;s Most Unique New Series 
          

In addition to its martial arts, wuxia tales often also include Chinese occult elements. This inclusion of the occult is likely linked to the ancient connection between Chinese martial arts and religion, More than a few styles of Chinese martial arts were created by monks as a means improving their spirituality, as well as their stamina. There&#39;s also the fact that there are a number of occult-like features in Chinese martial such as one qi or vital energy. It&#39;s not surprising that Jiangshi X includes these aspects in its story. While wuxia tales with their violently graceful fights are widely known in movies and television, it is not commonly found in manga, so this should make Jiangshi X stand out in the already loaded Shonen Jump catalog.

The more innovative twist that Jiangshi X adds to its tale is dark fantasy. Indeed, the story begins by framing the tale to be told as within the classic dark fantasy trope of darkness taking over the world as a result of the disruption of the balance between the forces of light and dark. There&#39;s also the inclusion of the jiangshi as the main threat to its three young heroes. While it&#39;s too early to tell if the new Shonen Jump series will be a success, its unique approach to a classic story format certainly makes its worth a read.




Jiangshi X is now available at Viz Media.
