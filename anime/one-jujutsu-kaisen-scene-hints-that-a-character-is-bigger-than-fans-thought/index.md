## Literature Review

The second season of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s anime has hinted that a seemingly minor character may actually be much more important than fans think.





In Season 2 episode #7, Jujutsu Kaisen includes a fun scene where Yuji reunites with an old acquaintance from middle school named Yuko Ozawa as Nobara and Megumi try to get them together. It&#39;s a fun vignette that perfectly captures the personalities of the three main characters in the series after a long time of not showing them. However, it also hints that Yuji&#39;s friend Yuko may be more important to the story than she may seem. While she was initially cut from season 1, and the pacing of this season likely made her inclusion here somewhat tough, Studio MAPPA still made sure to feature this scene, even at the cost of taking time away from the ultra-exciting Shibuya Arc battles.





 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Anime Hints Yuko Will Be More Important 
          

Since her first appearance in the manga before the exceptional Gojo&#39;s Past arc, Yuko has not shown up again in the story. This has led many fans to speculate that her appearance was just filler that won&#39;t impact the overall narrative. Even if this was the case, it wouldn&#39;t necessarily make her scene filler as it did a great job characterizing Yuji even further and letting Nobara and Megumi&#39;s characters shine. It also served as a lighthearted break before the more depressing arcs to follow, which was very welcome.

However, if Yuko does have a larger role to play later on, it could give some important clues as to how the series will end. The most natural role for Yuko to play later in the series is that of Yuji&#39;s final love interest who he winds up with after the threats plaguing Jujutsu society have been resolved. On some darker notes, she could also be used as a hostage to force Yuji to do something he doesn&#39;t want. She could also be used as a host body for the sorcerer currently possessing Geto&#39;s corpse, although this seems like the least likely option of all.






 Yuko May Fit Into Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s End Game 
          

No matter how she may be used later in the series, Yuko&#39;s inclusion in the second season after her absence in the first hints that creator Gege Akutami may have told Studio MAPPA to include her in the show. This implies he does have plans to do something with her later on in the manga, even if she has been absent for the majority of the series thus far. Fans will just have to wait and see how Yuko fits into Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s end game and whether she is important to the story after all.
