  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From classic influential titles like Perfect Blue to modern ones like Summer Time Rendering, these thriller anime are sure to keep viewers guessing.</p>
<p>In a medium as broad as the anime one, there is truly something for everyone, ranging from high-octane, action-packed shows, to wholesome, relaxing ones. But one genre in particular, namely thriller, tends to go underappreciated, as it lacks the explosive scenes to compete with its peers, instead relying on intricate stories and complex twists. Thankfully for fans of the genre, however, there are quite a few noteworthy options in terms of best thriller anime.
Thriller anime come in a variety of forms, with some taking place in supernatural or even futuristic worlds, while others are set in grounded, realistic ones. Many may overlap with the mystery genre, which perfectly lends itself to complex and complicated stories, full of twists and turns, but some take a different approach, deriving their suspense from intriguing settings and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as unexpected events occur.</p>
<p>10  Summer Time Rendering (2022)
Produced by OLM and Based on the Manga by Yasuki Tanaka</p>
<p>For the first time in two years, Shinpei Ajiro returns from Tokyo to his hometown of Hitogashima Island, to attend the funeral of his childhood friend, Ushio Kofune, who is said to have drowned while saving a little girl. During the funeral, Shinpei and his friends notice certain inconsistencies regarding the story of Ushio&rsquo;s death, and their curiosity grows even stronger as more mysterious events begin to unfold on the island. Even the tales of &ldquo;shadows&rdquo;, who are believed to announce one&rsquo;s demise, may turn out to be more than mere make-believe.
Starting out as a seemingly lighthearted, grounded, slice-of-life story, Summer Time Rendering gradually reveals itself to be much more complex than anyone could have predicted. The underlying mystery, combined with unexplained supernatural elements and an intriguing time loop theme, is sure to captivate viewers and keep them wondering. Telling a brilliant story aided by exceptional production values, Summer Time Rendering is one of the most underrated anime series.

<p>9  The Promised Neverland (2019)
Produced by CloverWorks and Based on the Manga by Kaiu Shirai &amp; Posuka Demizu</p>
<p>At the Grace Field House orphanage, kids seem to live happy and carefree lives together with their &ldquo;Mama&rdquo;, Isabella. Although they are not allowed to wander too far from the orphanage, they have no reason to do so either, as they are provided with everything they could possibly need, from clothes and food to a nice, familial environment. One day, however, the oldest and brightest children of the group, Norman, Emma, and Ray, learn the dark truth behind the supposed &ldquo;adoptions&rdquo; and the grim nature of the outside world.
Although its second season was rather disappointing and should best be avoided, The Promised Neverlandbegins with a shocking twist that only further develops into a remarkably compelling experience. Some may find the story quite simple, but this simplicity only allows the characters to shine better, taking viewers along on a highly atmospheric ride. All in all, this is one title that is sure to appeal to fans of the mystery and thriller genres, especially those with a penchant for survival themes.

<p>8  Pyscho-Pass (2012)
Original Series Produced by Production I.G</p>
<p>In the 22nd century, the society of Japan is redefined by the Sibyl System, which can supposedly objectively assess and predict human behavior. Thus, it is not only used to determine things such as one&rsquo;s most suitable career path, but also to analyze people&rsquo;s criminal intentions and decide their threat levels. Those who are found to be potentially dangerous are then subjugated by Inspectors such as Akane Tsunemori, aided by Enforcers like Shinya Kougami. However, the mysterious Sibyl System is not quite as perfect as most would like to believe.
While the franchise received a mixed reception overall, with some entries clearly outshining others, Pyscho-Pass&rsquo;s intriguing dystopian setting and thought-provoking themes elevate it above a simple crime thriller. Moreover, much to the delight of fans, the franchise&rsquo;s latest addition, the anime movie Psycho-Pass Providence, is finally available to stream on Crunchyroll.
Gen Urobuchi, who is credited as the writer of the highly acclaimed first Psycho-Pass season, also authored other brilliant, award-winning stories, such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero.</p>

His simple yet comfortable life takes a sudden turn when he ends up involved in the case of a missing girl, which leads to him being followed by both the yakuza and the police.
As a one-of-a-kind, award-winning title, Odd Taxi is not only a compelling mystery thriller but also a powerful human drama. Using storytelling techniques that are uncommon for the medium, seemingly unrelated events and characters are all linked together eventually, as if assembling a puzzle one piece at a time, with viewers taken along for the journey.

Following a string of bizarre events, they discover that they can also use the microwave to send text messages into the past, thus gaining the ability to change history.
Prioritizing substance over style, Steins;Gate offers one of the most riveting thriller experiences, building up anticipation and delivering a surprisingly satisfying conclusion.

<p>4  Death Parade (2015)
Original Series Produced by Madhouse</p>

Unbeknownst to the patrons, however, he also plays a significant role in determining their fate. Ostensibly, whether their soul is reincarnated or sent into the void depends on whether they win certain games or not, but it is Decim who makes this decision, based on the behavior they exhibit. As he encounters humans he cannot judge, Decim begins to doubt himself and the system.
While other stories may derive their suspense from a certain underlying mystery to be slowly unraveled, Death Parade is an intense psychological thriller instead, keeping viewers engaged by presenting tense situations and raising profound questions. Despite its serious nature, the story also manages to prove incredibly entertaining, featuring likewise intriguing characters who are sure to evoke certain emotions despite being supposedly emotionless themselves.

Deeply confident in his own sense of justice, Light becomes a serial killer to eliminate other criminals, which attracts the attention of the world-renowned detective L, marking the beginning of an intense intellectual duel.
Revolving around one of the anime medium&rsquo;s best morally gray villains, Death Note famously delivers a suspenseful experience in the form of a competition between two extremely cunning, genius characters, both of whom use creative ways to identify and escape the other. Even beyond the two, the other characters are equally interesting and memorable. Moreover, the story is not only thrilling but also profound, raising moral questions and thought-provoking ideas.

Not only is his social status affected, but he is also placed under suspicion for a string of mysterious murders. Nine years later, upon discovering that the serial killer is none other than the boy he saved, Johan Liebert, Kenzo sets out to find him and make amends.
