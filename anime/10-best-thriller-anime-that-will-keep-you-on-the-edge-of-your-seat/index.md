Thankfully for fans of the genre, however, there are quite a few noteworthy options in terms of best thriller anime.
Thriller anime come in a variety of forms, with some taking place in supernatural or even futuristic worlds, while others are set in grounded, realistic ones. Many may overlap with the mystery genre, which perfectly lends itself to complex and complicated stories, full of twists and turns, but some take a different approach, deriving their suspense from intriguing settings and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as unexpected events occur.
