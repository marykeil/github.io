## Literature Review

Many of One Piece&#39;s most powerful Devil Fruits can be traced back to a pivotal location that the manga and the Rocks Pirates are about to uncover.





On an island called God Valley, former Pirate King Gol D. Roger and Luffy&#39;s Grandpa Garp teamed up to take down Rocks D. Xebec and his crew, made up of powerhouses like Kaido, Big Mom, and Whitebeard. The God Valley Incident eventually saw the island erased from the seas. Before the World Government took such drastic action, the island hosted a disturbing manhunt where the Celestial Dragons killed slaves and innocents for sport, and the contest&#39;s prizes were teased in chapter #1095 of One Piece. 




          

The World Nobles are known for force-feeding their slaves exotic Devil Fruits for their enjoyment, so the six mysterious boxes are most likely rare Devil Fruits, as the shape of the boxes also fits other similar containers seen in the past. However, from what fans know about the incident, the prizes in those boxes will not go to the despicable Celestial Dragons.

 Many Mythical Zoan Devil Fruits Came From The God Valley Incident 
          

One Piece Film: RED revealed that Gol D. Roger recovered a chest on God Valley that contained a baby Shanks. Future chapters may confirm the film&#39;s information to be canon and the contents of the other chests that were shown to be in the Celestials Dragons&#39; possession. The mystery of the chests can be solved by analyzing which One Piece characters were present during the incident. Judging by the rare Devil Fruits the pirates involved in the incident later displayed, it&#39;s likely the six chests in chapter #1095 contain the incredibly rare Devil Fruits that are eventually eaten by Kaido, Yamato, Sengoku, Whitebeard, and Marco.




Kaido recalled Big Mom giving him the Mythical Zoan Azure Dragon during the God Valley incident in a short flashback during his fight with Luffy. While the Rocks Pirates have been described as the opposite of honorable, each may have grabbed one of the legendary fruits during the incident. Big Mom already had a fearsome Devil Fruit ability, so giving Kaido the Dragon fruit made him indebted to her for life. Kaido likely gained possession of the Okuchi-no-Makami Mythical Zoan that Yamato eventually ate due to starvation. Whitebeard acquired the strongest Paramecia, the Quake Quake Fruit, and his future First Mate Marco was eventually given the Phoenix Mythical Zoan Fruit.

The origin Sengoku&#39;s Mythical Devil Fruit is also a mystery that the God Valley Incident may help clear up, as it possibly ended up in Garp&#39;s hands, who then gave it to his best friend. This would then leave only one treasure chest that, if taken by Roger as seen in Film: RED, contained baby Shanks. With One Piece&#39;s final saga delivering on many of the series&#39; ongoing mysteries, expectations are rising for even more mind-blowing reveals before the series ends. Author Eiichiro Oda will reveal more details about the God Valley Incident, the Rocks Pirate captain&#39;s fate, and the Devil Fruits&#39; mysteries in One Piece&#39;s manga soon.
