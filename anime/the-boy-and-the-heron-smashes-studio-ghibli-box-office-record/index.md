The movie is at the top of domestic charts in North America, beating out hits such as The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and Godzilla: Minus One.




As reported by Variety, Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s latest film received incredible numbers a day after the movie was made available in North America, with an opening day box office haul of $5.4 million and an expected $10 million opening weekend.

According to Variety, The Boy And The Heron is projected to be this weekend&#39;s highest-grossing film, with its opening day raking in $5.4 million. It is expected to close out the weekend with more than $10 million and secure the top spot in North America. Studio Ghibli&#39;s new movie beat out The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which is in second place with a predicted $9.4 million, and Godzilla: Minus One at 3rd spot with $7.9 million. This is great news for anime fans all over, displaying how far anime has come, and how successful it is globally.

                  The Boy and the Heron Review: Ghibli&#39;s Best Movie in Years is Finally Here   The Boy and the Heron is the long-awaited new film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and it stands out as one of their best projects in years.   

Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s not-quite-final film was sure to be a hit, debuting with a score of A- on CinemaScore. The movie has been very successful and has made $84 million, with $56 million coming from Japan. What makes The Boy and The Heron&#39;s popularity astonishing is that there was zero marketing in the months leading up to the international release. This speaks to the global brand that Studio Ghibli has built, with movies like Spirited Away and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle taking over the world when they were released.




         

The first day of the film&#39;s debut has been nothing short of successful, with more than 2000 cinemas viewing the movie. Anime films have been doing well in North American cinemas in recent years, with Ufotable&#39;s Demon Slayer: Mugen Train garnering $49 million in the continent. The fact that this is a Hayao Miyazaki film isn&#39;t the only reason for its success, however, as there are many cogs in place that propelled it to wild heights. From the nostalgic art style, an incredible line-up of voice actors to the intricate plot, Studio Ghibli&#39;s The Boy and The Heron was always meant for greatness.
