## Literature Review

These shoujo anime have fluttered many hearts over the years. Their beautiful stories and charming romances are most deserving of a second season. 





Needless to say, the anime on this list are among the most loved shoujo anime from the last two decades that have fluttered many hearts and have told some of the most captivating and sweetest stories that never get old. That said, each of these anime only scratch the surface of the relationships they explore and still have much more to them that just could not be squeezed into a single season.

 10  Lovely Complex 
        

Lovely Complex left fans everywhere dying for more of Risa and Otani&#39;s hilarious yet endearing chemistry. Much like several other shoujo anime on this list, Lovely Complex seems ordinary at first but gradually wiggles its way into viewers&#39; hearts as the romance between the main characters begins to take off. Having said that, the anime does wrap up Risa and Otani&#39;s relationship as well as several of its subplots fairly well. The challenges and obstacles they face along the way leave viewers invested and make the eventual resolution all the more satisfying.
Overall, Lovely Complex is the perfect blend of romance, slice of life, and comedy that hits the mark every time, and even though it&#39;s been decades since its release, fans of the series can&#39;t help but want another season with more of the series&#39; silly antics and charming humor.





 9  Yuri on Ice 
        

Yuri On Ice captivated fans with its passion for skating, stunning visuals, beautiful music, and subtle romance between Yuri and Viktor. Despite not being based on a manga or light novel, Yuri on Ice was entertaining, wholesome, incredibly funny, and lighthearted yet bewitching, leaving fans longing for more. Although Season 1 did end on a satisfying note, fans wanted more of Yuri and Viktor&#39;s lovable antics as well as the opportunity to explore the other developing relationships teased toward the end of the series. Yuri Plisetsky and Otabek in particular had excellent chemistry featured prominently in Yuri&#39;s exhibition skate, Welcome to the Madness.
While MAPPA did announce a movie prequel titled Ice Adolescence in 2017, recent comments from the studio&#39;s CEO about the low profitability of the franchise suggest that the project may be indefinitely on hold or even canceled altogether seeing as it has been removed from the studio&#39;s coming soon section as well.





 8  Skip Beat 
        

Despite its run-of-the-mill story and typical assertive female lead, Skip Beat has an indescribable charm that somehow leaves viewers rooting for Kyoko as she makes her way through the glamorous entertainment industry. Although Kyoko&#39;s story begins fueled by revenge, it gradually turns into one of self-discovery with just the right amount of romance to keep things interesting. That said, the series ended before the relationship between Kyoko and Ren could fully bloom and left many of its subplots unresolved, including Ren&#39;s mysterious past.
Even though it has been over 20 years since the anime was released, there has been no news about a second season of Skip Beat despite the series having plenty of source material to adapt, disappointing several shoujo enthusiasts who still patiently lie in wait for a renewal.

 7  Say I Love You 
        

Say I Love You takes the tried-and-tested trope of &#39;shy girl meets popular boy&#39; and executes it to perfection. Despite its cliche premise, the anime portrays first love and high school relationships exceptionally well, in a way that reminds the viewer of their own experiences. Mei and Yamato&#39;s unlikely relationship is unexpectedly realistic and heartwarming. Unsurprisingly, the anime was immensely popular and had fans clamoring for more of its sweet romance.
Considering the manga has 18 volumes, a second season would have a reasonable amount of source material to go off while also exploring Mei and Yamato&#39;s relationship after high school. Not to mention, a second season would give fans of the series much-needed closure and also help wrap up the story nicely.





 6  My Love Story!!

Anime with love triangles are by no means uncommon. However, despite seeming like one, My Love Story!! is far from a typical love triangle story. Rather, the series reinvents the concept entirely into something wholesome, entertaining, and refreshing. The series&#39; complicated relationship dynamics prove it is far from a typical high school romance with complex, endearing characters and a sweet bromance that left audiences smitten.
Nevertheless, the anime does skip out on plenty of relationship development as well as the challenges Takeo and Rinko go through, including the frustrations of a long-distance relationship. More importantly, a second season of My Love Story!! would certainly quell doubts about Takeo and Rinko&#39;s relationship as well as settle whether Sunakawa is destined for romance or not for good.





 5  Yona of the Dawn 
        

Yona of the Dawn entranced many with its top-notch premise, world-building, characters, and notable attention to detail. Yona&#39;s journey is one of betrayal and finding strength in the face of tragedy. However, this strength does not come easy. In her pursuit of the dragons, Yona undergoes various hardships which forge her into the person she is by the end. Having said that, the series has yet to cover its driving conflict, namely Yona finally facing off against Su-won, her father&#39;s murderer, usurper of the throne to her kingdom, and her former love.
Considering the manga is still going strong with well over 40 volumes, Yona of the Dawn&#39;s story is far from finished giving it a comparatively higher chance of being picked up for a renewal than the other anime on this list as a second season could drive viewership to the manga.

 4  Blue Spring Ride 
        

Brilliant as it is, Blue Spring Ride&#39;s timeless story of childhood love still has much more in store. Ever since the anime ended with a rather infamous cliffhanger, no amount of live-action adaptions have been able to quell fans of the series. In fact, the ending of the anime is arguably only the beginning of the story as it sees Kou finally open up to Futaba and the rest of his friends, allowing them to share his grief and better understand him.
While the story has a long way to go before Futaba and Kou&#39;s relationship gets any closure, a renewal would most certainly promise lots of conflict and drama as they explore relationships with other people and struggle to get each other off their minds.





 3  My Little Monster 
        

At its core, My Little Monster is a simple yet charming romance between a nerdy girl and the school delinquent. However, as simple as it sounds, Haru and Shizuku&#39;s relationship is one fraught with conflict, denial, and plenty of change. Incompatible as they sound, each forces growth out of the otherâ€”Haru forces Shizuku out of her steely, untrusting shell while Shizuku curbs Haru&#39;s violent tendencies and helps him make friends by being his safe space.
That being said, the anime barely scratches the surface of their compelling, heart-racing romance and leaves many loose threads unresolved including Shizuku&#39;s love triangle with Yamaguchi and the budding relationship between the side characters. A second season of My Little Monster certainly has much to offer from hilarious antics and much-needed closure to more of Haru&#39;s pet chicken, Nagoya.





 2  Ouran High School Host Club 
        

Ouran High School Host Club is easily one of the most well-executed reverse harems in shoujo history. With a charming, romantic art style, excellent comedy, and unique, lovable characters, it&#39;s difficult to not fall in love with the series. The story follows Haruhi Fujioka as she begrudgingly joins the club but comes to not only accept it but see it as a place where she belongs, feels safe, and most importantly, loves. That said, while the anime does not focus entirely on the romance aspect, often reducing much of it to gags, especially when Tamaki is involved, it does have a few romantic moments that keep the tension alive and viewers satisfied.
Nevertheless, a second season of Ouran could finally give viewers a satisfying ending while also confirming who Haruhi does end up with, an area where the anime fails to appease.

 1  Maid Sama! 
        

As enchanting and beloved as Maid Sama! is, it is hard to deny that the series ends on a rather mediocre note. Although Misaki and Usui do end up together, the anime barely does their story or their characters justice. Rather, the anime ends with barely any character development most prominently from Misaki seems to still be in denial about her feelings for Usui.
A second season of Maid Sama! could explore several central conflicts as well as Usui&#39;s surprising backstory, all while giving Misaki the chance for some stellar character growth. Misaki not only acknowledges her feelings for Usui but changes and puts in immense effort to make it work, which makes their eventual happy ending feel all the more well-earned and heart-warming.
Although many of the anime on this list have a slim chance of getting renewed for a second season, they are definitely among the most deserving. Regardless of their chances, there is always hope for fans as proved quite recently with news of Kimi ni Todoke returning after 13 long years. One can only hope that other shoujo anime also come across such luck in the future, finally breaking the &#39;second season&#39; curse that has plagued the shoujo genre for decades.
