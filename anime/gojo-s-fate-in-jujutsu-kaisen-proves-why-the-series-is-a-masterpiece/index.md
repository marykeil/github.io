## Literature Review

The portrayal of Gojo&#39;s death proves that Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s non-standard way of storytelling is exactly what makes it one of the best manga available.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 236!!In Jujutsu Kaisen, heroes die so often that it&#39;s almost become a cliché, but the death of Satoru Gojo was so sudden that it caught a fan base already jaded by character deaths completely off guard. The surprise fans experienced, however, isn&#39;t an anomaly in the Jujutsu Kaisen experience. Rather, it was a deliberate creative choice by the author Gege Akutami, making the series one of the best battle manga ever.




In Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 236, Ryomen Sukuna pulled off one of the most shocking comebacks in shonen manga history with a once in a lifetime manuever that obliterated Gojo. Up until this point, Sukuna had lost in every stage of the fight. This isn&#39;t to say he was outmatched or lacked the ability to defeat Gojo. On the contrary, Sukuna was giving Gojo the fight of his life. But Gojo&#39;s mastery of his innate cursed ability Limitless, and his superb tactical intelligence allowed him to overcome every trick Sukuna threw at him.

 Gojo&#39;s Victory Seemed Like a Guarantee

At the start of the fight, fans understood that there was no guarantee that either party would win the fight without any challenges. This duel had been teased from the very first chapter, and during that time, fans had learned a lot about Gojo and Sukuna&#39;s abilities. That build up is what made fans so excited to finally see how this epic confrontation would play out. When the time finally came for the two to face off in chapter 236, it seemed as though Gojo was a far better fighter than the King of Curses.




It all came to a head when Sukuna, who was rapidly running out of options, pulled out his most lethal trump card – the Mahoraga. Immediately, Gojo was thrust into an unsafe position. But just like earlier on in the fight, Gojo seemed to have found a way to counter his opponent, and his victory looked more like a guarantee.



 No One Anticipated Gojo&#39;s Sudden Death 
Gege&#39;s masterful bait-and-switch writing technique was highlighted in chapter 236.
          

Out of nowhere, Sukuna managed to change the tides of the fight in a way that defied even the most convoluted sorcery-science in Jujutsu Kaisen. After pages of tense action, Satoru Gojo – the infamous, fan-favorite jujutsu sorcerer, was defeated. Ultimately, Gojo&#39;s fate proved Jujutsu Kaisen is a masterpiece. Few characters in other manga with Gojo&#39;s stature have been killed so suddenly. Gege&#39;s execution of his death was done so smoothly that most fans didn&#39;t see it coming, even though Gojo&#39;s death had been foreshadowed years ago.
