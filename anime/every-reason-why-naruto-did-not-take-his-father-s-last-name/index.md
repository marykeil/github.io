# Every Reason Why Naruto Did Not Take His Father s Last Name


## SUMMARY 



  Naruto&#39;s surname, Uzumaki, is actually his mother&#39;s maiden surname, which raises questions about why he wasn&#39;t given his father&#39;s surname, Namikaze.   The series explains that Naruto was given the Uzumaki surname to protect him from his father&#39;s enemies, which however ended up hiding from him the heroic legacy of his father while he was growing up as a rejected orphan.   Another reason was that the author wanted to hide the plot twist of Naruto&#39;s true parentage for as long as possible, which also gave him room for flexibility and improvisation if needed.

## Literature Review

Naruto is by bloodline every bit a member of his father’s Namikaze Clan as he is of the Uzumaki - so why didn’t he adopt his father’s name?




From the beginning of his story, Naruto has always been identified with the Uzumaki surname, which according to Western customs should mean that his father is an Uzumaki. However, Uzumaki is actually the clan of Naruto&#39;s mother, Kushina. This begs the question of why Naruto was given his mother&#39;s maiden surname, especially considering that the identity of Naruto&#39;s father remained a mystery for most of the series.




There are a bunch of reasons why Naruto&#39;s official surname should be Namikaze, which is his father&#39;s surname. First, there&#39;s the tradition of children adopting their father&#39;s names, which is not limited to Western society. Indeed, from Sasuke to Kakashi, most people in Konoha use their father&#39;s surname and are part of their father&#39;s clan.

          

Second, there&#39;s the physical resemblance. Naruto&#39;s bright yellow hair matches that of other members of the Namikaze Clan. The Uzumaki Clan, on the other hand, is known for its striking red hair. Most importantly, from Minato&#39;s perspective, is the legacy that passing his name to his son protects and extends. Surely, as Hokage, Minato would have wanted his son to bear his and the clan&#39;s name. However, it must be said that in pre-modern Japan, the more influential clan&#39;s name would take precedence when naming newborn children, so it&#39;s not completely absurd for Naruto to be an Uzumaki, as the latter clan used to be very powerful.





 Naming Naruto Namikaze Would Have Made Him A Target For His Father&#39;s Enemies 
          

However, the reason for Naruto&#39;s surname being Uzumaki took into consideration factors surrounding his well-being and safety. First and foremost, it hid the fact that Minato had a son. Minato was an exceptionally gifted shinobi. One of his greatest exploits occurred during the Third Shinobi War where he single-handedly helped turn the tide in favor of Konoha. Naturally, this led to the death of a significant number of opponents and the creation of countless grudges against Minato. If they knew he had a son, more than a few people would hunt him down to exact their revenge. Naming Naruto as an Uzumaki - a clan that had been hunted to extinction due to its special abilities and thus posed no more threat - was the best way to protect him.

The most obvious reason, however, has to be found outside of the fictional world of the series. Author Masashi Kishimoto wanted to keep the plot twist of the identity of Naruto&#39;s father hidden for as long as possible, meaning the boy had to have another surname. Some fans have also speculated that the reveal was actually a retcon, and Kishimoto did not plan for Naruto to be the Fourth Hokage&#39;s son. Regardless of how much truth is behind this belief, keeping Naruto&#39;s true parentage hidden for most of the series gave the author some room for flexibility and improvisation, if needed.




                  New Minato Manga Reveals Connection Between Naruto And Sasuke&#39;s Clans   The new Naruto manga has revealed unknown information about the nearly extinct Uzumaki clan, who met a tragic end similar to Sasuke&#39;s Uchiha clan.   

Still, the skill and expertise of Naruto&#39;s parents suggests that they would likely have ended up giving Naruto the Namikaze surname. They feared no one. Unfortunately, they were not around to have that opportunity - both dying soon after Naruto&#39;s birth. After their passing, Hiruzen Sarutobi - the Third Hokage - stepped in to take responsibility for Naruto. Understanding the various risks that a Namikaze and Uzumaki surname brought, he ultimately decided the least danger was in naming the child Naruto Uzumaki. As a result, Naruto&#39;s connection to the Namikaze Clan was largely removed from acknowledgment and ultimately forgotten.

While this possibly protected him to a degree, it also hid the identity of his heroic father from Naruto for much of his troubled childhood. Sarutobi&#39;s decision is still controversial among fans today: was the desire to protect Naruto from his father&#39;s enemies more important than the positive effect that growing up as the son of the Fourth Hokage could have had on him? In the end, the justification for Naruto having his mother&#39;s maiden surname was built into the story in a way that, while not exactly satisfying, at least makes sense overall.
