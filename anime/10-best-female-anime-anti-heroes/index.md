## Literature Review

Anti-heroines can be popular in an too, proving that there is more than one way to lead a story. They don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s approval to live their life.





Anime anti-heroes, in general, are not entirely uncommon, but most of them are men, who are typically allowed to have stronger and more dominant personalities, without needing to be considerate of those around them. Regardless, there are also female leading characters who are shown to go around the world as they see fit, without conforming to any rules, and making a name for themselves as some of the best anti-heroines.









 








 10  Revy (Black Lagoon) 
        

Black Lagoon&#39;s titular Lagoon Company is a group of people typically working for criminal organizations, providing services such as smuggling and piracy. Revy&#39;s personality seems perfectly suitable for her line of work, as she is known for being rude, aggressive, and sadistic, often using foul language and killing without any hesitation. However, this destructive behavior is actually fueled by her deep psychological trauma, as she was verbally, physically, and even sexually abused by people who were supposed to protect her. This caused her to desperately seek power, and being impoverished resulted in her obsession with money. However, Revy also seems to have a soft side, occasionally saving her comrades.





 9  Yuno Gasai (The Future Diary) 
        

As the female protagonist of The Future Diary, Yuno Gasai&#39;s identity and actions revolve around her love interest, Yukiteru Amano. Despite genuinely caring for Yukiteru and doing everything in her power to ensure his success in the survival game they&#39;re playing, her methods tend to be on the questionable side. Many of her problems stem from her childhood; after being adopted into a seemingly happy family, her father ended up being mostly absent, and her mother turned out to be abusive towards her, even locking her in a cage. This caused Yuno to become troubled and develop a twisted personality, often resorting to cruel and violent methods.
            
 
 Future Diary: The Main Characters, Ranked From Worst To Best By Character Arc 
Future Diary is a psychological thriller anime with a lot of messed up characters. Here is the quality of each character arc.








 8  Akame (Akame Ga Kill) 
        

Akame Ga Kill&#39;s eponymous anti-heroine, Akame, is a ruthless assassin who kills her enemies without showing any mercy or remorse. However, she is not entirely villainous, as she is shown to care deeply about her comrades, always trying to protect her friends and being affected when she is unable to do so. Her seemingly cold and emotionless nature is a result of her childhood, during which she, along with her sister, was sold to the Empire and forced into a cruel exam. The survivors were then trained by elite assassins to become effective killers, learning killing and espionage techniques, and undergoing difficult training.





 7  Lina Inverse (Slayers) 
        

As the protagonist of the Slayers franchise, Lina Inverse&#39;s actions are typically not too different from those of other heroic mages, as she too tends to spend most of her time fighting the forces of evil. What differentiates her from her peers, however, would be her methods; she has a short temper and a tendency to cause great collateral damage when fighting, using black magic derived from beings of chaos, with no regard or consideration for her surroundings. Moreover, coming from a family of merchants, she is always trying to get a good bargain, even forcing people to give her items for free occasionally.





 6  Triela (Gunslinger Girl) 
        

Gunslinger Girl revolves around the Social Welfare Agency, where young girls are given cybernetic implants and used as anti-terrorist agents, working alongside &#34;Handlers&#34; who brainwash them into being completely loyal, often at the cost of their memories. Triela became one of the Agency&#39;s first cyborgs after living a tragic life as a victim of the mob, routinely drugged and abused, and nearly dying at some point. She is shown to be one of the more compassionate and level-headed characters, often teaching and helping the other girls who are struggling. Though she is seen as an anti-hero because of how brutal she can be, Triela is but a product of her circumstances.





 5  Koko Hekmatyar (Jormungand) 
        

Koko Hekmatyar is an arms dealer, typically seen traveling with her squad of bodyguards around the world to conduct business. Her personality is difficult to assess, as she rarely shows her true feelings. Her behavior is occasionally immature, but she can also be composed, especially when dealing with business partners. One thing that can be said for sure is that she is determined, as she is leading a secret project known as Jormungand, with the goal of ending war and arms trade. This plan may involve casualties amounting to 700,000 people, but she sees that as a necessary sacrifice, which deserves to be made for the sake of achieving world peace.





 4  Shiki Ryougi (The Garden of Sinners) 
        

Born into a family of demon hunters, Shiki Ryougi grew up with two personalities, the stoic and cynical female persona, and the male persona who knows nothing but to kill. After being involved in an accident that leaves her in a 2-year coma however, she realizes that she lost her male persona SHIKI, instead gaining the &#34;Mystic Eyes of Death Perception&#34;, a supernatural ability that lets her perceive the death of any object or being. The Garden of Sinners follows Shiki&#39;s life and the mysteries she is wrapped up in, making no effort to hide just how cruel and merciless she can be when she wants to.





 3  Kaede (Elfen Lied) 
        

Elfen Lied&#39;s protagonist Kaede is a Diclonius, a species with horns and psychokinetic abilities, defined by one of anime&#39;s most tragic backstories. Raised in an orphanage, she grew up with the mistaken idea that her parents abandoned her and wanted her dead, causing her deep psychological issues. At the orphanage, she was not only neglected by the staff but also bullied by the other kids. As she matured, her vectors, or invisible telekinetic arms, also developed, and she unconsciously used them to murder people when she felt betrayed and enraged multiple times. Once she learns about love though, she makes the conscious decision to change and atone for her past.





 2  Clare (Claymore) 
        

Clare is a Claymore, or human-Yoma hybrid, fighting the demonic creatures called Yoma that torment the lands. Although she can be considered an anti-hero because of her generally cold and blunt attitude, seemingly prioritizing the elimination of Yoma above all else, including the protection of other humans, she proves herself to be rather kind beyond the surface, genuinely caring about her friends and comrades. Unfortunately, she has trouble expressing her feelings due to her traumatic past. After losing her parents to Yoma and being captured and abused by one, she was finally saved by another Claymore, namely Teresa, only to eventually lose her too, left with nothing but a desire for revenge.





 1  Michiko Malandro (Michiko &amp; Hatchin) 
        

Michiko Malandro, Michiko &amp; Hatchin&#39;s co-protagonist, is a strong woman with a troubled past. Growing up in an orphanage, she routinely stole from shops to provide for the other younger kids, feeling responsible for them. After leaving the orphanage, she eventually got arrested, later escaping prison to look for the daughter of her ex-lover, Hiroshi. Saving Hana, whom she would then name Hatchin, from an abusive foster family, the two set out on a journey together. Michiko may have strange ways of showing it, often appearing as abrasive or a troublemaker, not afraid of pointing guns at people, but she truly cares for the ones she loves, trusting them completely.
These anti-heroines prove that strong anime female protagonists can be popular too, despite not being particularly common. In fact, their rarity only makes them that more special. Rather than being dismissive or blindly following the expectations associated with the role of a leading character, they prove that there is more than one way to lead a story and set the tone of the action. That&#39;s what makes these female anime anti-heroes some of the coolest and most memorable anime characters ever.
