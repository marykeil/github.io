## Literature Review

In chapter #374 of Berserk, Guts finally has a reunion with another former member of the Band of the Hawk, and it couldn&#39;t happen at a better time.





In chapter #374 Berserk, an invading Kushan army finds Guts&#39; unconscious body after commandeering his vessel, which had just recently escaped from Elfheim after Griffith&#39;s tragic attack ostensibly restored the island to its rightful owners. Among the Kushan soldiers is a boy who clearly doesn&#39;t share their complexion. Although not officially identified, it&#39;s clear by what&#39;s shown that the boy is none other than Rickert.





 Rickert Has Joined The Kushan In Berserk 
          

Much has happened since the last time Guts and Rickert crossed paths. In fact, the manga has more than doubled in size since their last meeting in chapter #182. At the time, Guts had just informed Rickert of the unfortunate truth that Griffith had betrayed Band of the Hawk, but wouldn&#39;t let the boy join him on his quest for vengeance no matter how much Rickert begged. At the suggestion of Puck, Guts would begin his long journey to Elfheim soon afterward but only after stopping at Flora&#39;s Spirit Tree, where he would obtain the Berserker Armor. Meanwhile, Rickert would eventually head for Griffith&#39;s capital city of Falconia, where he would give Griffith the famous slap in the face.

 : Berserk Has Officially Broken Guts

In fact, it was around this time when readers last saw Rickert. In chapter #339, Rickert makde a tenuous alliance at Falconia with Silat, the same Kushan who first attacked Guts during the Golden Age. Silat wanted to learn more about Griffith, and Rickert was privy to this information, so they were a perfect pair. Silat was also planning to leave Falconia for a secret Kushan village instead of joining Griffith, and Rickert was more than willing to go along for the ride since it was understood that Griffith had likely ordered him killed. The last time readers saw Rickert was when he and Silat blasted their way out of Falconia in chapter #341.






 The Kushan And Rickert Could Be The Allies Guts Needs 
          

Although Silat and Rickert left Falconia together, this doesn&#39;t guarantee that Rickert has been accepted by the other Kushan soldiers. Rickert could very well still be disguised as a Kushan soldier to keep him from harm. In chapter #339, Silat mentions that Rickert is lucky because there was a time when outsiders wouldn&#39;t be allowed in their hidden village. This matters because most of the Kushan warriors joined Griffith, but if the rebel Kushan army has accepted Rickert, they could end up on Guts&#39; side. Silat informed Rickert in chapter #339, that he was unwilling to join someone as inhuman as Griffith, meaning that the two could now be leading the rebel army.

Anyone who is an enemy of Griffith is likely a friend of Guts. Moreover, Guts&#39; crew in chapter #374 point out that this Kushan army could have easily wiped them out but didn&#39;t, casting doubt on their evil intentions. The only caveat, of course, is that the Kushan soldiers in the latest chapter chain the unconscious Guts down, but knowing how renowned Guts&#39; destructive nature is, they could just be taking extra precautions with their prospective tenuous ally. Still, considering how seemingly desperate Guts&#39; situation is at the moment, it&#39;s good to see Berserk reunite its protagonist with one of his closest friends.
