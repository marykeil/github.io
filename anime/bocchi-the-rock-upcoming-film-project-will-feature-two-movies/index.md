## Literature Review

Bocchi the Rock! release new information regarding its upcoming film project, including a release window and that it will be a double feature.





Sure enough, new details about Bocchi the Rock!’s compilation film were given at a livestream celebrating the anime’s first anniversary. Rather than being a single film as previously announced, Bocchi the Rock’s compilation film will now be a duology; the first film will still premiere in spring 2024, and the second film is set to premiere in summer 2024. The compilation film being a duology gives a good idea of how much content will be in each film, and while there’s still no news about season 2 of the anime, the films can still be something to look forward to, nonetheless.




                  10 Great Anime Fans of Bocchi The Rock! Need to Watch   Fan of the hit anime Bocchi the Rock! but can&#39;t get enough? Here are a few great recommendations for those looking for similar titles.   


 The Bocchi The Rock! Films Are Exciting Even Without Season 2 
          

While specific details of Bocchi the Rock!’s compilation film duology are unknown, there’s a good idea of how much of the anime each film will adapt. Considering the pacing of the anime, it would make more sense for the first film to cover everything up to Kessoku Band’s first concert at Starry i.e. the first eight episodes of the anime, and for the second film to cover the culture festival from the last four episodes. That would allow each film to have a conclusive endpoint, so it would make the most sense for the duology to adapt the anime that way.




Bocchi the Rock!’s compilation films might seem unappealing to anyone hoping for season 2 of the anime, but there’s still plenty to be excited about. While the films’ main purpose is to abridge the original anime, as compilation films like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann’s and Code Geass’ have shown, there can still be original content that can do wonders to justify the existence of the project. For an anime like Bocchi the Rock!, this could come about in the form of scenes that further expand on the various character dynamics, or even through new songs, and in either case, that would certainly be something to look forward to.

          

There’s also the fact that the Bocchi the Rock! film duology could easily lead to a season 2. If the films are successful, then that could result in season 2 being greenlit to keep the series’ success going; it’s also possible that season 2 is already in development and CloverWorks simply wants to use the duology to announce it and advertize it. Whatever the case, Bocchi the Rock!’s compilation film duology will hopefully provide a fresh take on the hit anime with how it adapts the series, so there’s plenty of reason to look forward to its release in 2024.
