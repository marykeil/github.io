  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sometimes, a story will conclude in such a devasting way that its ending will stay with the viewer for a long time.</p>
<p>This article contains mentions of sensitive topics, including death, mental health, and war.</p>
<p>Anime is no stranger to tragic stories, having released some stories whose endings are so depressing that viewers have a hard time moving on from them. With its growing popularity, anime has continued to demonstrate its unique ability to move people. The medium evokes emotion using intense visuals and storytelling methods that could never work in live action.
Some instances of this are found in anime like Cowboy Bebop and A Silent Voice, which employ their visuals in different ways to convey feelings of loneliness. The most powerful stories can transport people into fictional worlds and make them feel like they are part of the plot. They have the power to generate strong feelings, whether they are happiness, anger, or sadness. Tragedies, in particular, can stay with audiences for a long time.</p>
<p>10 Your Lie In April (2014)
Produced by A-1 Pictures, based on the manga by Naoshi Arakawa</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 22  Where To Stream Hulu, Crunchyroll, Funimation</p>
<p>Your Lie in April may look like a typical romantic comedy on the surface, but it&rsquo;s actually one of the biggest tearjerkers in anime. The story follows 14-year-old Kosei Arima, a music prodigy who stops playing piano after his mother&rsquo;s death. When a young violinist named Kaori enters his life, her spirit and passion inspire him to take up the instrument once more.
As the series progresses, Kaori&rsquo;s health deteriorates and her fate is confirmed in the last episode with a stunning musical sequence. The series does an excellent job of illustrating some of its heavier themes using bright colors and vivid imagery. It&rsquo;s also notable for its soundtrack, which includes &ldquo;Hikaru Nara&rdquo;, the memorable and extremely catchy opening number by Goose House.

<p>9 I Want To Eat Your Pancreas (2018)
Produced by Studio VOLN, based on the light novel by Yoru Sumino</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 1 (Film)  Where To Stream Currently Unavailable</p>
<p>Even though the film&rsquo;s title makes it sound like a horror movie, it&rsquo;s a deeply moving story about building relationships and forming connections with people. It tells the story of a teenager named Haruki who befriends Sakura, his classmate with a terminal pancreatic condition. According to the film, the phrase, &ldquo;I want to eat your pancreas,&rdquo; is based on the belief that diseased organs can be cured by eating healthy ones.
The anime&rsquo;s premise is sad enough, but its unexpected ending is what makes it a tragedy. Sakura&rsquo;s fate is revealed in such a shocking way that viewers have a hard time processing it. While the film&rsquo;s post-credits scene is somewhat hopeful, it isn&rsquo;t enough to recover from the story&rsquo;s painful ending.

<p>8 Clannad: After Story (2008)
Produced by Kyoto Animation, based on the visual novel developed by Key</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 24 + OVA  Where To Stream HIDIVE</p>
<p>Clannad After Story is a sequel to the Clannad anime and is based on the visual novel&rsquo;s After Story arc. While the game has multiple routes, the anime follows Nagisa&rsquo;s story, which is considered the novel&rsquo;s &ldquo;true&rdquo; route. The original series begins with Tomoya Okazaki in his last year of high school, as he befriends five girls and falls in love with one of them. The second series follows Tomoya as he graduates, enters adulthood, and marries Nagisa.
The series is considered by fans to be one of the saddest anime ever made, particularly for its agonizing turn of events. After Nagisa gets pregnant, her illness becomes more severe and her health deteriorates. This leads to a series of misfortunes that build up and lead to one of the most gut-wrenching storylines in anime. However, the series finale involves a twist that will make viewers smile through their tears.

<p>7 Death Parade (2015)
Original anime created by Yuzuru Tachikawa, produced by Madhouse</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 12  Where To Stream Hulu, Crunchyroll, Funimation</p>
<p>Despite having only 12 episodes, Death Parade managed to make an impact on fans. Part of this is due to the anime&rsquo;s interesting concept, which follows a mysterious figure named Decim who serves as the bartender and arbiter of the Quindecim bar. When two people die at the same time, they are brought to the bar and subjected to a series of games that will determine whether they reincarnate, or fade into nothingness.
The unique series discusses morality and explores in depth what it means to be human. When an amnesiac woman appears at the bar, she acts as Decim&rsquo;s assistant and teaches him about the complexity of human nature. This makes the white-haired being question his judgment and re-evaluate his understanding of right and wrong. The final episode reveals the woman&rsquo;s tragic past and will leave viewers struggling to process their emotions. This is followed by a touching finale that is especially depressing – but in a hopeful way.

Produced by MAPPA, based on the manga by Akimi Yoshida</p>

<p>4 Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (2022)
Based on the Cyberpunk: 2077 Video Game by CD Projekt Red</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 10  Where To Stream Netflix</p>
<p>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is based on the video game Cyberpunk 2077 and serves as a stand-alone prequel. As expected from Studio Trigger, the anime has a visually striking art style and an atmospheric soundtrack, which makes it a treat for the senses. The story takes place in the dystopian Night City, and follows a teenager named David Martinez as he becomes a black market mercenary known as an &ldquo;edgerunner&rdquo;.
Befitting its genre, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a melancholy tale set in a world where nobody can win against the system. As David becomes over-reliant on enhancing his body with cyberware, he loses touch with reality, and his mental health declines. A series of harrowing events ultimately lead to tragedy for the edgerunners. After the anime&rsquo;s bleak ending, fans will surely tear up when they hear Rosa Walton&rsquo;s iconic track, &ldquo;I Really Want To Stay At Your House&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners<br>
David Martinez (Kenichiro Ohashi) is a streetwise kid living in the slums of Night City in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. To survive, David becomes an edgerunner, also known as cyberpunk, taking on mercenary jobs outside the system. Together with a group of new and veteran edgerunners, David will shoot for the moon to escape the underbelly of the increasingly cyber-obsessed city. Unfortunately, the law isn&rsquo;t the only group that the edgerunners will have to contend with, as other heavily cyber-augmented humans will pose an even more significant threat. </p>

<p>10 Best Binge-Watch Anime on Netflix<br>
Netflix has a vast catalog of original and classic anime, with many being perfect for a weekend-long binging spree.</p>
<p>3 Texhnolyze (2003)
Original anime series directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki, produced by Madhouse</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 22  Where To Stream Funimation</p>
<p>Released as an experimental anime, Texhnolyze is known for its nihilistic outlook on the world. The underrated gem is set in the joyless dystopia of Lux, where it follows the misanthropic Ichise after a dangerous man severs his arm and leg. Through a process called &ldquo;texhnolyzation,&rdquo; he is given prosthetics, but later becomes caught in a power struggle between the different factions of Lux.
The anime is known for its slow-paced storytelling and philosophical nature. It addresses many existential questions only to tell the viewer that humanity is ultimately doomed no matter what they do. It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable story where nothing good happens to any of the characters. The series maintains hopelessness throughout but still manages to end in an incredibly depressing manner.

<p>2 Devilman Crybaby (2018)
Based on the original manga by Go Nagai</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 10  Where To Stream Netflix</p>
<p>Known for its disturbing imagery and complex themes, Devilman Crybaby quickly established itself as one of the most controversial anime of its time. The series tells the story of Akira, who merges with a devil to help his friend, Ryo, prove their existence to the world. Different from other human hosts, Akira maintains his humanity and &ldquo;crybaby&rdquo; nature after becoming the eponymous Devilman.
The series explores several philosophical concepts, including human corruption and existentialism, and is not for the faint of heart. Throughout the anime, there is an overwhelming sense of dread that continues to accumulate until it reaches a terrifying climax. Unlike most stories, which offer even the slightest beacon of hope, Devilman Crybaby&rsquo;s ending is nothing short of hopeless. The finale is the definition of the idea that no matter what happens, it is all pointless in the end.

<p>1 Grave of the Fireflies (1988)
Produced by Studio Ghibli, based on the short story by Akiyuki Nosaka</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 1 (Film)  Where To Stream Currently Unavailable</p>
<p>This early feature is known by fans for being one of the best Studio Ghibli films, but the only one they refuse to watch again. The story is notable for being a bleak and personal depiction of war, where characters are constantly given hope only to have it taken away in the end. The heartbreaking film tells the story of two siblings as they struggle to survive during the end of the Second World War. After losing their parents, the children face many hardships as they navigate through Kobe amidst the disaster.
The film was based on a short story about the author&rsquo;s own experiences during World War II, and was written as an apology to his sister, who passed away from malnutrition. Ghibli&rsquo;s masterpiece is a tragic tale from start to finish, with the opening scene showing the siblings&rsquo; devastating fates, and the rest of the movie serving as a flashback until that point. Due to its heart-rending story about the consequences of war and its effect on children, Grave of the Fireflies&rsquo; takes its rightful place as the anime with the most depressing ending.
