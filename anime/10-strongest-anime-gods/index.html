Unlike other gods,
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
&rsquo;s Truth is an abstract concept that embodies the entire universe.
The strongest god from anime is
Dragon Ball Super
&rsquo;s Zeno, who rules over the entire Multiverse and can easily erase universes from existence.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The strongest gods in anime history aren&rsquo;t just strong, they&rsquo;re forces of nature capable of breaking their series&rsquo; very reality.</p>
<p>Over the years, many powerful gods have appeared in anime. Series like Kamisama Kiss and Noragami are inspired by Japanese traditions, while others, like Record of Ragnarok, are influenced by cultures and belief systems from around the world. While many stories draw from existing sources, some create original deities for their fictional world.
In simple terms, a god or deity is a being whose powers are greater than an ordinary human&rsquo;s. They usually have command over some aspect of the universe, and they are often worshiped by humans. Most gods in anime are immortal, but they can still be wounded or killed on occasion. Others, like Haruhi Suzumiya, are fully mortal. Regardless of lifespan, however, many of these gods hold great power over their respective domains.</p>
<p>10 Ultimate Kars Can Transform Into Any Living Creature
Jojo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure is Produced by David Productions &amp; Based on the Manga by Hirohiko Araki</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 190  Where to Stream Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, Hoopla, Pluto TV</p>
<p>Kars is introduced in Battle Tendency as the leader of the Pillar Men. To overcome his weakness for Hamon, he and his fellow warriors ruthlessly pursue the Red Stone of Aja. He obtains the stone after fighting Lisa Lisa and uses it to unleash a form that makes him invulnerable to both sunlight and Hamon. The newly immortal Kars then battles Joseph, who causes a volcanic explosion and sends the deity into space. Since he cannot die, the Pillar Man remains trapped there for eternity.
Kars is Jojo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventures&rsquo; Stone Mask&rsquo;s original creator and one of the most intelligent beings in existence. In addition to his superhuman strength and resistance to Hamon, his Ultimate Form is immortal. Since his new body contains the DNA of every organism, he can alter his physique to become any living creature. With these characteristics, he is potentially invincible. However, the Pillar Man is ultimately defeated by his hubris and Joseph Joestar&rsquo;s unconventional thinking.

<p>9 The Forest Spirit Can Choose To Give Life Or Take It Away
Princess Mononoke is Written and Directed By Hayao Miyazaki &amp; Produced By Studio Ghibli</p>
<p>Runtime 133 Minutes  Where to Stream HBO Max</p>
<p>Princess Mononoke&rsquo;s Ashitaka first sees the Forest Spirit while traveling with the injured men. The deity, who is described as a god of life and death, later heals the prince from his bullet wound. During the day, it ranks as one of Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s scariest creatures as a deer with a human-like face. At night, however, it transforms into a giant, two-legged creature known as the Night-Walker. After Lady Eboshi beheads the god, the spirit searches for its head and causes all the surrounding life to die.
The Forest Spirit has power over both life and death. Its blood can heal illnesses and its mere presence can foster plant growth. As shown by how it euthanizes Okkoto, the Deer God can also take away life by touching its targets or breathing on them. While its deer form is impervious to damage, Eboshi proves that its Night-Walker form is vulnerable. Since all life depends on its existence, the Forest Spirit is an essential and powerful deity.</p>
<p>Princess Mononoke<br>
From Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is set in ancient Japan and follows Prince Ashitaka who, after being wounded by a corrupted boar spirit, ventures out on a quest to lift the curse placed on him by the wound. Originally written and performed in Japanese, the English-dubbed version of the film stars Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, and Minnie Driver. </p>

<p>8 Yato Was Once A Terrifying God of Calamity
Noragami is Produced By Bones &amp; Based on the Manga By Adachitoka</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 25 + 4 OVA  Where to Stream Crunchyroll</p>
<p>In Noragami, Yato is a Delivery God who accepts wishes for 5 yen. He is introduced as a minor deity who aspires to be a God of Fortune and have his own shrine. It&rsquo;s revealed that he was once a God of Calamity who was born from a wish to eliminate the gods. As time passed, however, he was quickly forgotten by the human world.
Yato is a god who can teleport, possess humans, and survive potentially fatal attacks. As a former God of Calamity, he killed many people and was feared for his murderous tendencies. The deity is also a master swordsman and one of the few gods who possesses a sentient weapon partner with his Blessed Regalia. While Yato primarily uses his blade to destroy phantoms, he can also sever the bonds between people. As shown by how he splits the Heavens, his sword can cut through almost anything.

<p>7 Ryuk Can Control A Human&rsquo;s Lifespan With The Death Note
Death Note is Produced By Madhouse &amp; Based on the Manga Written By Tsugumi Ohba and Illustrated By Takeshi Obata</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 37 + 2 Films  Where to Stream Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Crunchyroll, Peacock, The Roku Channel</p>
<p>Due to his boredom with the Shinigami Realm, Ryuk drops a second Death Note into the Human World. The notebook is found by Light Yagami, who initially uses it to cleanse evil from the world. The Shinigami follows Light while observing his actions and taking pleasure in his elaborate scheming. Despite his fascination with the young man, Ryuk ultimately takes his life using the Death Note.
As a Shinigami, Ryuk has the power to control death by writing names in the Death Note. He doesn&rsquo;t require food or sleep and will remain immortal as long as he kills humans with his notebook. As evidenced by Rem&rsquo;s untimely death, the only limitation to his power comes if he uses the Death Note to save a human&rsquo;s life. This is easily avoided if Ryuk continues to follow the rules of the Shinigami Realm.

Pokémon is Produced By OLM &amp; Based on the Concept By Satoshi Tajiri</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 1,232 + 23 Movies  Where to Stream The Roku Channel, Tubi, hoopla (Arceus and the Jewel of Life)</p>
<p>Arceus is a Legendary Pokémon that is also known as &ldquo;The Original One&rdquo;. According to legend, it came into being and created the Pokémon universe, the Lake Guardians, and The Pokémon of Myth. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, the deity saved the world from a meteor storm but nearly died after losing its Life Plates. It was saved by a human, who later betrayed it and forced it into a thousand-year slumber. Upon waking up and passing judgment, the Pokémon&rsquo;s wrath nearly destroys the world.
As their creator, Arceus has a significant influence on the Pokémon of Myth and can recreate them at will. It also has the uncanny ability to alter the laws of nature by stopping time and reversing destruction. The Pokémon&rsquo;s powerful awakening leads to distortions that make time and space collide. Since Arceus is a Normal-type Pokémon, it can use its Multitype ability to transform into any of the other types. Overall, Arceus&rsquo; exceptional power makes it the Pokémon universe&rsquo;s equivalent of a god.

<p>5 King Enma Jr. (Koenma) Has Full Authority Over The Spirit World
Yu Yu Hakusho is Produced by Pierrot &amp; Based on the Manga By Yoshihiro Togashi</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 112  Where to Stream Crunchyroll, Tubi TV</p>
<p>Koenma is King Enma&rsquo;s son and the prince of the Spirit World. As his father&rsquo;s successor, he is tasked with judging souls and deciding their fate. After reviving Yusuke, he makes the boy a Spirit Detective and tasks him with hunting demons in the Human World. Koenma is hundreds of years old despite appearing as a toddler, and his pacifier is an incredibly powerful weapon. After King Enma&rsquo;s corruption is revealed, he eventually succeeds his father as the Spirit World&rsquo;s new ruler.
As demonstrated by Yusuke, he can unlock a user&rsquo;s latent Spirit Energy and control it at will. For his signature ability, Koenma stores Spirit Energy in his pacifier and releases the strongest defensive spell in existence. The technique is usually reserved for catastrophes and is powerful enough to trap S-Class demons behind a barrier. While Koenma is unable to contain Sensui&rsquo;s Sacred Energy, this is due to his spell weakening after he revives Gamemaster.

<p>4 Beerus Has Yet To Unleash His Full Power
Dragon Ball Super is Produced By Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Akira Toriyama</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 131  Where to Stream Crunchyroll</p>
<p>Beerus is Universe 7&rsquo;s God of Destruction and is responsible for maintaining balance throughout his domain. He first appears in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods, where he threatens to destroy Earth and battles against Goku&rsquo;s Super Saiyan God. As the series progresses, he grows fond of the planet&rsquo;s warriors, particularly Goku, and often supports them in their endeavors. As the one who ordered Frieza to destroy Planet Vegeta, he is partially responsible for the Saiyans&rsquo; extermination.
As one of Dragon Ball&rsquo;s strongest Gods of Destruction, Beerus can easily destroy solar systems. His speed allows him to travel across the galaxy in minutes, and his sneeze is enough to blow up several planets. A simple tap from Beerus instantly defeats Goku&rsquo;s Super Saiyan 3 form, and a subtle finger flick launches him across the planet. While the deity has yet to showcase his full power, his clash with Super Saiyan God Goku breaks the universe apart. According to the Supreme Kais, Beerus is capable of destroying the universe.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Super<br>
Dragon Ball Super is a sequel to the original Dragon Ball series as well as the fan-favorite Dragon Ball Z anime.

<p>Number of Episodes 28 + Film  Where to Stream Crunchyroll</p>
<p>After Kyon befriends his classmate Haruhi, he is begrudgingly forced to comply with her antics. She establishes the SOS Brigade to investigate the mysterious phenomena in the world.

They tell Kyon that Haruhi is a powerful god who can shape reality and that their appearance is a result of her desire to meet extraordinary characters.
Haruhi&rsquo;s transcendent power allows her to alter reality through her thoughts and emotions. She subconsciously traps everyone in a time loop after she wishes for summer break to never end. Her unstable mood also leads to the emergence of cataclysmic pocket dimensions called &quot; d Spaces.&quot; It&rsquo;s revealed that three years earlier, Haruhi unknowingly destroyed the universe before creating the current one. Since she is unaware of her god-like powers, she poses an incredible danger to humanity.

<p>2 Truth Connects The Universe And All Living Beings
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is Produced By Bones &amp; Based on the Manga By Hiromu Arakawa</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 64  Where to Stream Hulu, Crunchyroll</p>
<p>When the Elric brothers use Human Transmutation to bring their mother back, they are confronted by an omnipotent being called Truth. As payment for breaking the taboo, the mysterious entity takes Edward&rsquo;s limbs and Alphonse&rsquo;s body. When an alchemist opens a metaphysical portal called the Gate of Truth, they will be required to give something in return. To get his brother back, Edward trades his alchemy and consequently forfeits his Gate.
Since Human Transmutation violates the laws of equivalent exchange, Truth restores balance by punishing those who attempt to &ldquo;play God.&rdquo; While the entity can appear cruel, it fairly judges its offenders by maintaining balance. It shows that death is absolute and that alchemists must still follow the laws of nature. Truth embodies the universe and exists within the consciousness of all living beings; as an abstract concept, it can&rsquo;t therefore be killed or destroyed.

<p>1 Grand Zeno Is The Strongest Being In The Multiverse
Dragon Ball Super is Produced by Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Akira Toriyama</p>
<p>Number of Episodes 131  Where to Stream Crunchyroll</p>
<p>Despite his cute appearance, Zeno rules over the Multiverse as its supreme leader. After his timeline is destroyed, Future Trunks joins Goku to bring Zeno&rsquo;s future counterpart to his present self. He befriends Goku after the Tournament of Power, much to Beerus&rsquo; horror and Zeno&rsquo;s delight. The two deities are thrilled with their new friendship and become co-rulers of the Multiverse.
Zeno&rsquo;s near-infinite power makes him the strongest being in the Multiverse. After erasing six of the eighteen universes, he destroys a few more during the Tournament of Power. While these are later restored, Zeno&rsquo;s nonchalant attitude toward the catastrophe is especially concerning. He is often shown with apathy and a lack of remorse for causing death; however, this is said to be due to his strong desire for companionship. While most gods are limited to one universe, Zeno controls all universes. This fact alone is enough to make him the strongest god in anime.</p>
