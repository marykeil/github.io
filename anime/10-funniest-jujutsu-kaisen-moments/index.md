## Literature Review

The funniest scenes in Jujutsu Kaisen offer a break from the show&#39;s serious plot and help to further characterize its cast in a short amount of time. 





Some of the funniest moments in Jujutsu Kaisen often involve interactions between the main trio and Gojo, but the series frequently mixes them in, in between moments of downtime and the Jujutsu Sorcerers&#39; lethal missions.









 








 10  Fushiguro Getting Hit On 
        

 Speaking of some of the more humorous scenes in Jujutsu Kaisen, one that stands out is the bonus Jujutsu Stroll scene following the end of episode 23. This scene is several minutes of pure shenanigans that start with an exhausted Gojo and Kugisaki sitting down. When Itadori starts shouting for their attention, their initial response seems to be to disregard him until Itadori reveals that someone is flirting with Fushiguro. Gojo and Kugisaki spring into action, seemingly undeterred despite their previously exasperated states, and the three of them launch into &#39;Formation B&#39;.
The implications that the trio not only anticipated something like this may happen, but they&#39;ve come up with multiple scenarios to presumably deter anyone&#39;s attempts at hitting on Fushiguro. It turns out that Itadori misunderstood the interaction, and naturally Fushiguro tells them off for embarrassing him, but these little moments really characterize the relationship between these four main characters.





 9  Good Boy! 
        

 While this scene is very brief, it&#39;s also quite memorable. Toward the beginning of episode 4, Fushiguro elaborates on how his Divine Dog will serve to help them as they enter the juvenile detention center to deal with the cursed womb. Kugisaki and Itadori are concerned about finding their way back to the entrance because the door is masked by the presence of Innate Domain. Fushiguro assures them that his Divine Dog will be able to recall the scent of the entrance.
The encouragement is a visible comfort, as Fushiguro even remarks that they seem too calm about the situation after, and has Kugisaki and Itadori cuddling up to and praising the delighted canine shikigami. Fans can hardly blame them for sneaking in a chance to pet a cute dog, after all, no matter how ferocious they can be in a fight





 8  No Cursed Techniques? 
        

Itadori is disappointed when he finds out during his training with Gojo he won&#39;t be allowed to use any cursed techniques, which is understandable, given the bubbly protagonist&#39;s newfound abilities. The way that the series portrays this by ultimately simplifying the way that Itadori looks while he sinks to the ground in defeat, especially in contrast with everything around him, does make this moment a little bit comical, as well. Itadori subsequently begins to list off a series of moves that he wanted to be able to do – and all the moves listed are actually specific techniques from popular shonen series, which is a fun nod to well-known manga and anime as well.





 7  Tokyo and Kyoto Baseball Game 
        

The Tokyo and Kyoto Jujustu students are pitted against one another in a game of baseball in the later half of episode 21. Interspersed with some truly meaningful moments – such as Kamo recalling the conversation he had with his mother when she left – this showdown features mostly comical interactions and ends on an inspirational note. Highlights include the Mechamaru acting as a pitching machine, Momo&#39;s save while using her broom, and the little facts delivered with the introduction of each pitcher. Times of respite like these in shonen anime are always a breath of fresh air and give fans a chance to see characters interacting outside perilous circumstances.





 6  Huh? Me? 
        

 After securing another of Sukuna&#39;s fingers toward the end of episode 24, the trio is pretty exhausted. As a result of their state, Fushiguro passes the finger off to Itadori (since he&#39;s the one in the best shape), but reminds Itadori not to eat it. Just as Itadori is internally remarking about the insult to his intelligence, one of Sukuna&#39;s mouth&#39;s pops up on his hand and eats the finger. Itadori is scolded in spite of the fact that it technically wasn&#39;t his fault, and he complains about how Sukuna didn&#39;t even contribute to the retrieval of the object this time around. The comedic timing of the beat after Itadori inadvertently consumes the finger and the shift of the expression on Fushiguro&#39;s face is definitely well done.





 5  Idiot A and Idiot B 
        

On assignment, Kugisaki and Itadori end up meeting some individuals who used to attend the same middle school as Fushiguro, though that isn&#39;t revealed right away. Kugisaki sees these individuals smoking and remarks that they should beat them up and set them straight, to which Itadori responds ,&#34;Why?&#34; These students seem ready to start a fight as a result, until they see Fushiguro.
They bow deeply and greet the group instead, leading Kugisaki and Itadori to believe that the respect they&#39;re showing was directed at them. However, the punks address Fushiguro by name, singling him out and leading Itadori and Kugisaki to pester him for answers. At this point in the series, audiences are aware that Fushiguro got into fights in middle school, but the way this is revealed to his friends and their subsequent response is far too amusing not to be noted.





 4  Nanami&#39;s Introduction 
        

Upon introduction, Nanami states that one thing he&#39;s learned is that he dislikes Jujutsu sorcerers, which catches Itadori off guard. Then, he continues to say that he worked at a &#39;typical company&#39; and learned that working is just as bad. In the end, since they were both terrible options, he chose the one he was better suited for. It&#39;s an unexpected conversation, followed up with Nanami remarking that while he trusts Gojo, he doesn&#39;t respect him. It becomes clear that Nanami is very open about his opinions, but the unexpected way in which the audience learns that makes out introduction to his character a bit humorous.





 3  Revolving Sushi 
        

 A scene that involves an intense match of Rock-Paper-Scissors is always memorable, and this particular section pits Itadori and Kugisaki against one another to determine where the group should have dinner. Itadori wants the experience of a revolving sushi bar, which Kugisaki initially protests. Their passion for the subject juxtaposed with the lack of energy with which Fushiguro occasionally chips in is a humorous contrast. Ultimately, Itadori does win Kugisaki over by talking about how the restaurant serves sushi to customers on a bullet train. Kugisaki hilariously pictures an actual bullet train, in no small part due to Itadori&#39;s wording, instead of a miniature bullet train as in the case in some Japanese restaurants.





 2  Student Council President vs. Sea Angel 
        

 This playful scene happens early on in the series, before things take a turn in Itadori&#39;s life. Itadori and the fellow occult members are contacting some spirits to ask questions and the first one he poses is, &#34;Which creature is the council president just barely weaker than?&#34; The board spells out a seal angel, which prompts the club to go into a fit of hysterics right before the council president shows up to scold them.





 1  Like &#34;That&#34; 
        

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 is quick to hop back on track in the second half and dive straight into the Shibuya Incident; however, there is a playful scene involving the main trio and a friend from Itadori&#39;s middle school. When Ozawa confesses to thinking she might have a chance to get closer to Itadori, Kugisaki responds with &#34;You don&#39;t mean &#39;that&#39;, do you?&#34; to which Ozawa returns, &#34;Yes, I mean &#39;that&#39;.&#34; For a brief moment, during their responses, the entire style changes and their expressions in conjunction with the more comical style are sure to draw out some chuckles.
The ensuing conversation, which pulls Fushiguro in to help, is full of shenanigans, but is also an earnest attempt. The funniest moments inJujutsu Kaisen seem to serve to characterize the series&#39; cast in a short period of time, offer more insight into their relationships with one another, and give the audience a break from its more gruesome events. They help successfully show other sides to characters that might otherwise only exist in dark and deadly circumstances.
