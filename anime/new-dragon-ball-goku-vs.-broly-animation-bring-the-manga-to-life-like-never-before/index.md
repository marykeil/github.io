## Literature Review

A new Dragon Ball Super fan animation features an epic battle between Goku and Broly and a shocking development for the Legendary Saiyan.




One talented fan animation has showcased Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Goku and Broly in a new epic training bout that expertly nails the action and character writing fans adore. Broly was reintroduced into the franchise during 2018&#39;s Dragon Ball Super: Broly film, where his character received a significant upgrade in both power and backstory. However, the improved character has unfortunately been absent in most of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s latest releases, and a skilled animator decided to change that.




The Dragon Ball franchise has captivated millions of fans around the globe and even inspired many to start learning how to animate their own projects. The Legendary Super Saiyan Broly has starred in several jaw-dropping fan projects that make the fan-favorite character into a force of nature that would take more than usual means to defeat. However, Dragon Ball fan and skilled animator Eduardo Quintana created something new that perfectly honors and develops Broly&#39;s updated character in a short film called Dragon Ball Saisen - The Animated Manga.


 

Within 14 months, Eduardo created the short project in his free time that sees the once terrifying Legendary Super Saiyan fighting Goku while training on Beerus&#39;s planet. The 90-second project picks up from Broly&#39;s latest appearance - in the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, recently adapted in the manga - which shows him training with Goku and Vegeta on Beerus&#39; planet. The animation expands on that brief sequence and it is formatted like an incredibly well-crafted manga chapter but with stellar animation and action. It features more character development from Broly than the entirety of his original DBZ film trilogy.





 Eduardo&#39;s Fan Animation Develops Broly More Than Dragon Ball Has In Years 
         

Broly&#39;s reintroduction into the Dragon Ball franchise changed his backstory and made the previously uncontrollable Legendary Super Saiyan into a more layered character. Even in the new franchise canon, the marooned Saiyan still suffers from the occasional outburst of uncontrollable, planet-destroying rage. However, forming strong bonds with Goku, Vegeta, and Cheelai has helped evolve the character dramatically. Eduardo&#39;s well-crafted video demonstrates this beautifully by showing Broly almost losing himself to his power after taking a blow from Goku. Instead of losing control, Broly recounts the new bonds that he treasures. However, the excellent character development doesn&#39;t end there.

Dragon Ball Saisen demonstrates incredibly satisfying action and character development for Broly. After avoiding another meltdown, the Legendary Saiyan gains control of a powerup that radiates tranquility more than rage. Delighted by the development, Goku smirked, and the two continued to battle as the video concluded. However, the tear-inducing ending sees Broly discard the last piece of clothing from the planet he grew up on, the sash from the first friend he&#39;d ever made, a vicious giant creature named Baas, symbolizing that Broly has fully moved on from the lonely brute he once was.






 Eduardo Quintana Have Made Broly A More Interesting Character 
          

The first debut of Broly in 1993&#39;s Dragon Ball Z: Broly â€“ The Legendary Super Saiyan introduced the titular character as a one-dimensional powerhouse hellbent on destroying Goku. Luckily, the 2018 film retconned that history and made Broly into an innocent soul cursed with monstrous strength. Eduardo Quintana&#39;s fan project, Dragon Ball Saisen, proved not only the animator&#39;s chops in creating dynamic battles in Goku and Broly&#39;s training session but also a true understanding of the characterization of the beloved characters. It might be some time before fans see more of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s version of Broly, but when that happens fans can hope that his return will be even half as satisfying as Eduardo&#39;s brilliant short film.
