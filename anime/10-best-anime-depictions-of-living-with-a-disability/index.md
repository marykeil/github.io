## Literature Review

Some anime stories minimize or overturn physical disabilities, but these ones provide genuine and earnest representation, in a thoughtful manner.





As such, it is that much more impressive when anime stories go the extra mile and attempt to realistically portray the experience of living with a physical disability. Showing the way characters interact with the world, as well as the way other people around them react to their conditions, without reducing them to their disability, is a surprisingly fine line to walk, with many stories failing to maintain this balance.









 








 10  Ranking of Kings 
        

Ranking of Kings&#39; protagonist Bojji is disabled because of a deal made by his father, who received power from a demon in exchange for his own son&#39;s abilities. Thus, he is born not only deaf and mute, but also abnormally weak and small. This has severe implications for his life, as most of the people in his kingdom look down on him in spite of his status as the prince, and many fail to realize just how intelligent and kind he truly is. Another point that adds to the commitment of the show is that it includes accurate sign language which was overseen by official Japanese organizations.





 9  A Silent Voice 
        

A Silent Voice follows a deaf girl named Shouko Nishimiya, whose hearing loss leads to severe bullying from classmates and peers during her childhood. This, combined with her difficulty in connecting with others, results in her developing self-esteem issues, blaming herself, and feeling guilty about things that are out of her control. While the title is somewhat contentious for its choices, bullying and the traumatic consequences thereof are real concerns that need to be addressed. Moreover, it also depicts the profound regret of the bully, Shouya Ishida, who learns sign language to reconnect with Shouko and sincerely apologize for the thoughtless actions of his younger self.





 8  Yuki Yuna is a Hero 
        

One of Yuki Yuna is a Hero&#39;s protagonists is Mimori Tougou, a girl who, after losing the ability to use her legs when she was younger, has become a wheelchair user. What&#39;s particularly noteworthy is that, even though this is a Magical Girl anime, she doesn&#39;t magically regain her legs in her transformed form either; instead, she moves around using extensions of her costume and engages in long-range combat. What&#39;s more, other characters also end up losing different bodily functions and needing to figure out how to live with their new condition later on, though there is unfortunately one particular development close to the ending that hurts this show&#39;s legitimacy.





 7  Josee, the Tiger and the Fish 
        

Josee, the Tiger and the Fish&#39;s titular protagonist Josee, whose real name is Kumiko Yamamura, is a young girl whose condition as a paraplegic has affected her throughout her life. Needing a wheelchair to move around, she has rarely had the chance to go out by herself, leaving her with the unfulfilled dream of seeing the outside world for herself. Moreover, because of the way society treats her, she has also grown to generally fear strangers, and developed a tendency to act in a more defensive and seemingly mean manner, even to her loved ones, in an attempt to seem less vulnerable and more confident than she really is.





 6  Interviews With Monster Girls 
        

While not as evident as other stories, Interviews With Monster Girls presents certain parallels to real-life disabilities, albeit with a mythological twist. The story follows a teacher who seeks to connect with and learn from demi-humans, all of whom are affected by their identity. For example, there is a dullahan whose head is always detached from her body, requiring her to be more careful and mindful than others, as well as a vampire who needs to constantly drink blood. As society is not built for such demi-humans, they tend to be misunderstood and treated differently. Fortunately, this show is generally wholesome, thanks to the teacher&#39;s genuine curiosity and kindness.





 5  Your Lie in April 
        

Although it is never revealed exactly what ails Kaori Miyazono, Your Lie in April&#39;s protagonist, it is made clear that it&#39;s a severe illness, most similar to Friedreich&#39;s ataxia. Firstly, she has spent much of her life being hospitalized, missing out on many experiences as a result. Furthermore, as her condition deteriorates, there are times when she even experiences bouts of paralysis in her legs, unable to get back up. Finally, when she realizes that she doesn&#39;t have long left to live, she makes up her mind to spend her remaining time with no regrets, doing everything she never had the courage to do, and being as happy as possible.





 4  My Sister Momoko 
        

Although it is older and lesser known, My Sister Momoko remains a profoundly emotional movie about a girl who is both mentally and physically disabled, yet extremely hardworking and cheerful. After previously attending a special school, the titular Momoko finally gets the chance to learn alongside her twin brother. Watching her doing her best to fit in and be independent is inspiring not only for the viewers, but also for her classmates, who, after initially dismissing her, end up empathizing with her and developing a deep respect for her efforts. Overall, this is a touching anime story that will make anyone cry.





 3  Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion 
        

As the sister of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion&#39;s protagonist, Nunnally vi Britannia represents not only Lelouch&#39;s primary motivation for building a better world, but also a strong character in and of herself. When her mother was assassinated, she became paralyzed due to bullet wounds and blind due to the trauma. In spite of her condition, she remains positive, always smiling and showing kindness and empathy to others. In fact, it could even be said that it is exactly her situation that allows her to be so kind and understanding, as she knows what it means to feel weaker than others, and to need to work harder to keep up.





 2  Violet Evergarden 
        

Violet Evergarden&#39;s eponymous protagonist is a girl who has only ever known life on the battlefield. This affected her not only emotionally, as she never learned how to be human, but also physically, as she lost both of her arms in the war. Although she makes use of silver prostheses instead, she is still different from others. Firstly, there are things she has difficulty with, such as writing with a pen. Another interesting aspect is the reaction of other characters when finding out about her prostheses, whether they are curious or hesitant to discuss them, which is a common occurrence for people with visible conditions.





 1  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 
        

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s protagonist, Edward Elric, loses his right arm and left leg after breaking a fundamental rule of alchemy. He may receive prosthetic limbs that make his life easier, but those also come with their own set of issues, especially considering that they need to be repaired regularly. Even after going through the painful surgery of obtaining automail prostheses, he continues to experience phantom limb pain. Furthermore, there are things he cannot do, as approaching water or extremely cold or hot places can cause his automail to rust, freeze, or even burn his skin. While he remains strong in spite of it, his physical condition certainly affects him.
While the anime stories that depict life with physical disabilities may be limited in number, they are all extremely valuable in providing representation of conditions that many people deal with, as well as insight into issues that most may not think of. These series do an important job and contribute to spreading the message that everyone feels respected and included, as no voice should go unheard. As such, anime stories that earnestly present important issues that others avoid or mock, such as physical disabilities, are especially notable and praiseworthy.
