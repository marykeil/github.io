  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Anime assassins possess skills and abilities that surpass even John Wick&rsquo;s impressive capabilities. They excel in close-quarter combat, marksmanship, and observation, giving them the upper hand in a face-to-face confrontation.
Each anime assassin has unique strengths that could outmatch Wick. Whether it&rsquo;s Rei Suwa&rsquo;s fearlessness, Chisato Nishikigi&rsquo;s spider sense-like abilities, or Jonah Mar&rsquo;s war-fighting experience, they all have tactics that can overpower Wick&rsquo;s skills.
While John Wick may be a formidable assassin, there are certain anime assassins like Alphard Al Sheya, Duke Togo, and Yor Forger who possess physical prowess, martial arts mastery, and stealth that make them more likely to defeat him. Wick&rsquo;s aggression and chaotic fighting style can be exploited by these assassins, ultimately giving them the advantage.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While John Wick might be the deadliest assassin with a grudge on the silver screen, he hasn’t got anything on his new colleagues in anime.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, there are few, if any, movie assassins who would stand a chance against John Wick. But now that Wick&rsquo;s decided to take his talents in the anime world, he&rsquo;ll run up against a bevy of anime assassins who can give him a run for his money. This is not to say that Wick lacks impressive skills, but anime assassins bring that art to the next level.
Wick is not a superhero but he is a super-conditioned person. At the very least, he shares the same physical attributes of an ultra-elite athlete. This includes his conditioning, durability, endurance, stamina, agility, and resilience. In addition to those basic attributes, training, and experience make him an expert marksman, swordsman, and hand-to-hand combat fighter. Despite these attributes, however, the best anime assassins would more than likely best Wick in a face-to-face confrontation.</p>
<p>10  Rei Suwa - A Steely Assassin Forged By A Vicious Upbringing
Buddy Daddies | Yoshiyuki Asai | P.A. Works</p>
<p>Rei Suwa and John Wick match up evenly. Both have family connections to the criminal underworld. Both were raised from childhood to be assassins. Both are adept at close-quarter combat. Both are skilled marksmen, firearm experts, and knife-fighters, and both have killed more than a few opponents. Both even look a bit alike. The key difference is their personality. Rei was given no love as a child, whereas John – by and large – was treated well.
While Rei’s attitude has softened somewhat since he and his partner Kazuki Kurusu adopted Miri, he’s still a fearful professional assassin. Wick, on the other hand, has clearly lost his interest in the assassination game. He only came out of retirement to get revenge for his dead dog. Accordingly, it’s that lack of focus in Wick that gives Rei the edge in what would likely come down to a hand-to-hand fight.

<p>9  Chisato Nishikigi - Her Spider Sense-Like Abilities Means You Can Never Surprise Her
Lycoris Recoil | Yasunori Bizen | A-1 Pictures</p>
<p>Outside their history of killing, Chisato Nishikigi and Wick have much in common. Both have developed serious questions about the legitimacy of their profession. While Wick decided to retire, Chisato now refuses to kill a target. Both are also known to have pulled off legendary assignments. Wick killed three men with a pencil, and Chisato single-handedly defeated a terrorist cell when she was only seven years old. Chisato’s powers of observation, however, give her a major advantage over Wick.
This power combines her knowledge of an opponent with details of the environment, such as her opponent’s position in the room, their weapon, and weapon position. This allows her to predict an opponent’s movements with near-perfect accuracy. As a result, she would be able to avoid Wick’s attacks while deploying her own punishing counterattack.

<p>8  Johnathan &ldquo;Jonah&rdquo; Mar - Mild Mannered But Deadly Efficient
Jormungand | Keitarou Takahashi | White Fox</p>
<p>Jonah is a child, so there are a number of physical advantages that Wick would have over him in a pure hand-to-hand combat situation. However, what Mar lacks in pure physicality, he makes up for in other areas. Most importantly, there’s his war-fighting experience. Indeed, having been a front-line soldier since he was big enough to hold a gun, in some of the most heinous wars of the times, he’s developed an uncanny ability to sense and make shots that no one else could dream of making.
Fighting in wars has also made Jonah an expert at moving attacks, meaning he’ll never stand still and shoot. Instead, he’ll shoot and move immediately to an alternate vantage point, keeping an opponent guessing where the attack is coming from. As such, he’ll likely take Wick on with a gun, shooting to keep Wick pinned down until he finds the ultimate vulnerable angle for a one-shot kill.

<p>7  Alphard Al Sheya - Born to Kill With Authority
Canaan | Akira Ishida | P.A. Works</p>
<p>Physically, Wick will have met his match in Alphard Al Sheya. Just like many of the best and most cunning anime assassins, Alphard began her training as a child. Her melee attacks are otherworldly. She wastes few movements, preferring to strike an opponent’s vulnerable points hard and fast.
But where she’s most likely to beat Wick is through the combination of her martial arts mastery and gun skills. Indeed, she handles a gun like it’s an appendage. There would be no way for Wick to block her skull-crushing kicks while evading a gunshot to the kidney.

<p>6  Duke Toga - The Silent But Deadly Assassin Extraordinaire
Golgo 13| Takao Saito | The Answer Studio</p>
<p>If they were not facing one another in combat, it’s likely that Wick and Duke Togo would be buddies. Like Wick, Togo is quiet and likes his privacy. But when he gives his word to do a job, he never fails to get the job done. While he has more than enough ability to succeed in close-quarter combat, Wick’s skills, along with his ability to use anything as a weapon, means Togo would likely lose if the fight simply came down to a hand-to-hand fight.
However, Togo excels in his marksmanship and gunslinger skills. Indeed, his ability to incorporate his custom-made M-16 assault rifle into his melee tactics will not only keep Wick at a distance but will ultimately land the killing shot.

<p>5  Irina Jelavic - A Certified Master Killer
Assassin Classroom | Yusei Matsui | Shueisha</p>
<p>Irina Jelavic might be the most unconventional assassin in anime. She’s neither a hawk-eyed sniper nor a deadly fighter – though she is skilled enough at both to be a top-level assassin. What she does have is a genius-level ability to plan her hits, including multiple fail-safe and alternate plans to such a degree that success is guaranteed. Normally, her plans include her own otherworldly skills of seduction.
Knowing Wick’s weakness for the memory of his wife, Jelavic could play on that vulnerability to distract him just long enough for her to get a gunshot to the back of the head or place a diamond-hard knife into his heart. Indeed, she might even get Wick to fall in love with herself, making his death the easiest hit ever.

<p>4  Sharon &ldquo;Vermouth&rdquo; Vineyard - A Criminal Kingpin With A Stealthy Finishing Move
Detective Conan (Case  d) | Gosho Aoyama | TMS Entertainment</p>
<p>Unless you are Marvel Comic’s Kingpin, crime bosses rarely come out of their backrooms or gilded palaces to mix it up on the streets. It’s not only dangerous but there’s also the increased likelihood of being caught by the authorities. But that’s not the case for Vermouth. Not only is she the leader of the Black Organization – the syndicate responsible for transforming Conan into a child, but also its most lethal member.
There are three elements to her ability to take out Wick. First, it’s her mastery of disguise. She’d be able to get up close and personal with Wick without him knowing it. Second, it’s her gunslinger abilities. She can make dead-on shots from all angles. Last, it’s her resilience. She won fights despite nursing broken bones and gunshot damage.

<p>3  Mireille Bouquet - A Cold-Hearted Killer With An Angel&rsquo;s Face
Noir | Ryoe Tsukimura | Bee Train</p>
<p>Mireille Bouquet certainly doesn’t look the part of a master assassin but don&rsquo;t take her appearance for weakness. Not only is she one of the best killers in the world, but she’s also one with the coldest heart. While others might be driven to kill for hire by dysfunction, hatred, or because of the organization they work in, Mireille sees it simply as a way to make ends meet – no more, no less. As such, she can apply an extremely practical approach to the job that always reminds her it’s better to live and fight another day.
Her approach to taking out Wick would employ the same practicality. She knows she won’t be able to overcome his aggressive and chaotic fighting style head-to-head, so she’ll use her other skills as an advantage. John is known to have a heart of gold under his rough surface, and Mirielle could lull him into a false sense of confidence before hitting a sneak attack.

<p>2  Zenji Banba - An Expert In Taking Out Other Assassins
Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens | Chiaki Kisaki and Kisara Akino | Satelight</p>
<p>While there’s nothing about Zenji Banbu to suggest he would be much of a threat to Wick, the same cannot be said for his alter ego – the Niwaka Samurai. The Niwaka Samurai is known as the “hitman of hitmen.” He presents a real-world version of the Chainsaw Man. That is, he has an uncanny ability to take out other assassins – even when they know he’s after them. At the very least, he has a fearsome enough reputation to make other assassins fear his presence and think twice about challenging him.
Regarding his abilities, his weapon of choice is the katana sword, which he can wield with lightning-fast speed. Wick will have just a few seconds to react once he knows Niwaka is present. While John is also used to fighting off other assassins who are after his life, Zenji/Niwaka&rsquo;s expertise will make this a fight with an uncertain outcome.

<p>1  Yor Forger - Everyone&rsquo;s Favorite Stand-In Mom/Merciless Assassin
Spy x Family | Tatsuya Endo | Wit Studio and CloverWorks</p>
<p>If there’s an anime assassin capable of taking down John Wick for sure, it’s Yor Forger. She matches him in nearly every metric that’s been used to illustrate his prowess. She’s as strong, as fast, as agile, and as durable as a Wick. No one other than perhaps Alphard Al Sheya can match her martial arts skills. She prepares well for a hunt and understands how to move without being seen. While she surely knows her way around a gun, she prefers two golden spikes to stab and impale her targets.
Indeed, while Yor can snipe a person at a distance, she rather likes to knock them off at close range. Like Wick, she also employs an aggressive, frenetic attacking style that overwhelms opponents as quickly as possible. Indeed, the fight with John Wick will be a nasty, brutal, all-out brawl. Nevertheless, Yor’s endurance and stamina will ultimately prevail, proving why she is one of the best and most popular anime assassins.
