## Literature Review

In the manga&#39;s epic final battle, Sukuna is still showing why Jujutsu Kaisen is a modern Shonen masterpiece with innovative uses of his abilities.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter #247!




Sukuna is one of the most powerful characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, but a surprising application of his Cursed Technique in the series&#39; biggest battle proves that there is more to him than mere strength and also shows why the manga is a modern Shonen masterpiece. Mangaka Gege Akutami is truly a genius when it comes to constructing battles between his various high-powered characters, as even the most straightforward Cursed Technique can have a myriad of unanticipated uses in the right hands.

In chapter #247, translated by John Werry with lettering by Snir Aharon, Sukuna continues to battle Higuruma and Yuji in Shinjuku. Higuruma is trying to hit Sukuna with the sword generated from his Cursed Technique, which will hopefully end the fight if it connects. Sukuna on the other hand is enjoying the battle as he has seen talent in Higuruma similar to Gojo&#39;s and that intrigues him.

          




After Sukuna is briefly distracted by someone firing a blood manipulation technique at him, Higuruma manages to land a surprise hit against him, stabbing his hand. However, Sukuna is able to quickly cut off his hand using his Cursed technique before Higuruma can hit him. This shows that Sukuna&#39;s technique is much more versatile than it appears.


 Sukuna&#39;s Versatility Proves Jujutsu Kaisen is Great 
          

Sukuna can use a variety of Cursed techniques, famously showing a still-unexplained fire technique during the Shibuya Incident, but the main technique he is known for is cutting. These abilities come in two types: Cleave, which is used on living things that possess Cursed Energy, and Dismantle, which is mainly used on inanimate objects. His Domain Expansion Malevolent Shrine also pairs with these abilities, allowing to rapidly hit anything in its wide range. These powers are generally viewed as offensive attacks as they are incredibly destructive, but Sukuna using them defensively on his own arm shows they are more versatile than that.




Sukuna&#39;s versatile use of his powers reflects the cleverness and thought that Akutami puts into each of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s cursed techniques. While this is most evident in the manga&#39;s most confusing powers like Hakari&#39;s Domain Expansion, even simple techniques are more than they appear. It only makes sense that a character like Sukuna, who is incredibly powerful and has been around for hundreds of years, would have a deep understanding of his ability, and be able to use it instantaneously for both attack and defense. This makes Sukuna an even more unpredictable character despite his seemingly straightforward technique, which makes him even more of a threat.



 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Characters&#39; Knowledge of Their Powers Makes it Great 
          

Sukuna isn&#39;t the only character with a deep knowledge of the applications of their abilities. Nearly every character in the series is like this, which is part of what makes the seriesâ€™ fights so exciting. It&#39;s widely known that Akutami took inspiration from Hunter X Hunter for his power system, which is based mostly on how well characters know their abilities and how effectively they can use them, just like Nen, but Jujutsu Kaisen has developed this concept even further, cementing its place as one of the most innovative Shonen of the generation. With much more of the fight against Sukuna left to go, Jujutsu Kaisen fans will likely get to see even more interesting uses of his powers before the manga ends later in 2024.
