 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 8? 
          

In Undead Unluck episode #8, “Victhor”, Shen gained an advantage over Spoil thanks to his Negator ability Untruth, which reverses the actions of anyone he looks at so long as he likes them. Shen still couldn’t defeat Spoil, so the plan then became for Andy to use Shen’s Nyoi-Kinko Staff to take Spoil into space so he wouldn’t be able to rot anything. In order to survive being so close to Spoil, however, Andy had to remove the card in his head and become Victhor, the god of victory, who then proceeded to defeat Spoil and return to Earth almost instantly.

After returning to Earth, Victhor, who prefers to be addressed as “Victor”, decides to kill Fuko so Andy wouldn’t have the strength to regain control of their body, and when Shen tried to fight him, he was beaten down with little effort on Victhor’s part. Fuko pleaded with Andy to fight back against Victhor so they could keep spending time together and keep trying to fall in love, which caused the space where the card was to start bleeding, and while that didn’t work, Fuko was saved from being killed by Victhor thanks to the Union arriving at Longing to fight him.

Not much is known about Victhor at this time, but it’s clear that he’s going to play a big part in Undead Unluck’s worldbuilding. In addition to being familiar with the Union, Victhor knows about the concept of days of the week, something that doesn’t seem to exist in Undead Unluck, so he’s bound to know some of the hidden truths of the world, including the specifics of the God the Union is trying to defeat. Victor has the potential to answer a lot of the story’s mysteries, and it makes the wait for Undead Unluck episode #9 all the greater.
