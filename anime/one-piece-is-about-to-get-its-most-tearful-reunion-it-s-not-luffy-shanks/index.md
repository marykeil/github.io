## Literature Review

The Egghead arc has set up one incredible One Piece reunion that will be hard to top, even for Luffy and Shanks.




Warning: Spoilers For One Piece chapter #1100




One Piece is a series that excels in presenting emotional moments, and the latest manga chapters have set up a reunion between Kuma and Bonney that could be more dramatic than the highly-anticipated one between Luffy and Shanks. The last time readers saw Luffy,  he finally avenged the Straw Hats biggest loss, taking down Admiral Kizaru on Egghead Island. However, the overwhelming entrance of Saint Saturn of the Five Elders and his confrontation with Bonney was the catalyst for a pivotal flashback that ensures that when Kuma inevitably shows up, it will be heartbreaking.

The manga chapters covering the tragic history of Kuma and his adoptive daughter Bonney have been an emotional rollercoaster in One Piece&#39;s otherwise epic Egghead Island arc. Despite containing several shocking revelations, author Eiichiro Oda is likely preparing readers with context that&#39;ll make Kuma and Bonney&#39;s potential reunion even more emotional than the expected meeting of Luffy and Shanks.

          




Chapter #1100 finally presents Kuma with a cure for Bonney&#39;s fatal disease but at a high cost. In order to ensure her safety, Kuma must not only become a Warlord of the Sea for the World Government, but he must also give up his body and free will. Another cruel stipulation from Saint Jaygarcia Saturn forbid Kuma from seeing Bonney after she was cured, a reunion the manga seems almost ready to deliver.


 Now That Bonney Knows The Truth, Kuma&#39;s Arrival On Egghead Seems Necessary 
          

After Dr. Vegapunk was caught collaborating with pirates, the World Government took it upon themselves to interfere with Kuma&#39;s quest to save Bonney&#39;s life. Elder Saturn agreed to have Bonney cured, but Kuma would be forbidden from seeing her after she was healed, a cruel deal considering the innocent girl&#39;s dream of traveling the world with her father. Still, Kuma&#39;s overwhelming joy at the news his daughter could be saved was stunningly depicted by Oda&#39;s artwork and shading. The hulking figure&#39;s emotional reaction makes sense, considering all the traveling and dead ends the dedicated father met when trying to ensure that Ginny&#39;s daughter lives a happy and full life.




Although the Kuma flashback has yet to conclude, readers have enough context to know that things did not go well for Bonney or Kuma after their initial meeting with Dr.Vegapunk. Bonney&#39;s father is a very different man from when he confronts the Straw Hats on Thriller Bark. With the added context, his previous actions have a different meaning. How much of Kuma is still alive in his original body has been a big mystery, one that was recently rekindled when Kuma&#39;s apparently mindless body started to move, heading in a mysterious direction. That, combined with Bonney&#39;s thirst for revenge fueled by learning of Kuma&#39;s past, ensures that if the two come face to face on Egghead, it will be a tearful reunion for both the characters and readers.



 Kuma (Or What&#39;s Left Of Him) Is Likely On His Way To Egghead Island 
          




In previous chapter, readers have witnessed that Kuma, after being reduced to a mindless slave of the Celestial Dragon and then rescued by his former comrades of the Revolutionary Army, has inexplicably started moving and making his way to an undisclosed location, which could be Egghead. With Luffy exhausted from his battle against Admiral Kizaru, many readers expect Kuma to arrive in time to save Bonney from Saturn. While One Piece fans have long anticipated Luffy and Shank&#39;s reunion, it will have a high bar to contend with after the emotional weight and hopefully satisfying conclusion at the end of Bonney, Kuma, and Saint Saturn&#39;s confrontation on Egghead Island.
