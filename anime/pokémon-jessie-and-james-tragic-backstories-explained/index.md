## Literature Review

Team Rocket’s Jessie and James both have extremely tragic, yet very obscure backstories that give enormous depth to Pokémon’s most iconic antagonists.





Team Rocket’s goal is to use Pokémon for their own gain by selling and exploiting them in whatever way they can in order to take over the world. Jessie and James, two agents with the organization, can often be seen trying to steal Ash’s favorite Pokémon and best friend Pikachu. Their attempts at capturing the small lightning Pokémon are often quickly ended by Ash.





 Jessie and James Had Difficult Childhoods 
          

Both Jessie&#39;s and James&#39; troubled history often goes unnoticed by viewers, but knowing this backstory is important to understanding these Team Rocket agents. Jessie ended up in a foster home when her mother Miyamoto, another Team Rocket member, left her to find and record the voice of Mew, an exceptionally difficult Pokémon to track down. Meanwhile, an arranged marriage was set up for James, which led to him running away from home. Eventually, the two came to work together, despite their very different backgrounds.

Jessie&#39;s backstory is mostly suggested throughout the anime. Jessie’s mother was an active-duty class-A member of Team Rocket. She left Jessie behind at a foster home while pursuing her mission to record the voice of Mew, but the foster home was lacking in money, and sometimes Jessie would have to eat snow because food was scarce. Jessie attended the Pokémon Nurse School where she met and befriended a Chansey, an interesting point considering how later on she ended up stealing and exploiting such Pokémon.




James&#39; backstory is largely revealed in episode #48, &#34;Holy Matrimony,&#34; of the anime. James grew up in high-society under the watchful eye of his millionaire parents. They set him up for an arranged marriage to Jessebelle, and while James did like her at first, he quickly realized that Jessebelle was too controlling and did not represent what he wanted from life. James ran away from home and even left behind his pet Growlithe, whom he loved dearly. Eventually James met Jessie shortly after joining up with Team Rocket, as fresh new recruits in boot camp.



 Did Team Rocket Actually Help Jessie and James? 
          

Just like in real life, criminal organizations like Team Rocket appeal to those who&#39;ve struggled in their lives because it offers them a place to fit in. Jessie and James met each other and made an intense personal connection with each other pretty quickly. The same can be said for Meowth, when he showed up and joined the team. Time and time again, despite threats to break up the team, Jessie and James discover that they really can&#39;t go on without each other, and ultimately committed to chasing Pikachu, even if it was fruitless, just so they could be together. In that sense, Team Rocket has been a weirdly positive force in Jessie and James&#39; lives.




 : Pokémon: Jessie &amp; James&#39; Relationship Explained

Throughout the Pokémon series, Jessie and James are often portrayed as the evil team that will stop at nothing to get what they want. While this might be true, they are more than just Team Rocket agents looking to exploit Pokémon in whatever way they can. They have deep backstories that give their characters a more human dimension. Perhaps it is Jessie and James&#39; tragic backstories that continue to motivate them to keep coming back after blasting off whenever they are defeated in Pokémon.
