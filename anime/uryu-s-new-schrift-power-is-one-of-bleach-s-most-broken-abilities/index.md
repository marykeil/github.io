## Literature Review

The return of The Thousand-Year Blood War saw Uryu gain a new power through his Quincy heritage, and this ability is wildly overpowered.




Warning: Spoilers for Bleach: The Thousand-Year Blood WarBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War&#39;s second part wasted no time getting down to the plot, with its opening scenes promoting Uryu to a position of prominence in the Quincy organization, as well as granting him a new power. It&#39;s the nature of this new power, however, that just might make Uryu too overpowered for the plot.




In Thousand-Year Blood War, Quincy leader Yhwach gives his subordinates a special power, known as a &#34;schrift,&#34; which each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. These powers can be quite strong, as seen with Bleach&#39;s Stern Ritter Y, who disguised himself as Yhwach and was able to fight at an incredible level while in that state. While most other Stern Ritter and their schrift abilities have yet to be demonstrated on screen, they&#39;re all enough to make their wielders a serious threat, and that goes for Uryu, too. There is one noteworthy aspect to Uryu receiving his schrift, though, and that&#39;s the fact that Yhwach says it is the same as his own.


 Uryu&#39;s &#34;A&#34; Schrift Is One Of Bleach&#39;s Strongest Powers 
          

Uryu was given the &#34;A&#34; Schrift, which in the manga is said to stand for &#34;Antithesis.&#34; The Antithesis ability allows its wielder to take what has happened and reverse the outcome. If Uryu were losing and taking a lot of damage, for example, he could use the Antithesis ability to transfer all the damage he had taken to his opponent, while whatever had been dealt to his opponent would be transferred to him. Uryu isn&#39;t just limited to using this on himself, or even just on injuries; any two objects that have interacted are eligible for this reversal.




It&#39;s not hard to see how this ability could become story-breaking very soon. In some ways, it&#39;s similar to Orihime&#39;s ability to &#34;reject&#34; the occurrence of events, but the ability to not only undo, but reflect it back at one&#39;s opponent makes it far more powerful. While Uryu has yet to use this ability on screen in the Thousand-Year Blood War anime, his first opportunity to do so will soon arrive, as the Quincy launch their final war on Bleach&#39;s Soul Society. While the ability in Uryu&#39;s hands is scary enough, the thought that Yhwach has a similar ability makes him go from nearly impossible to completely unbeatable, barring the development of an even more overpowered technique.



 How Uryu&#39;s Schrift Power Stacks Up Against Ichigo 
          

Of course, fans are very much looking forward to the inevitable moment when Uryu clashes with Ichigo. Antithesis is very powerful, and it&#39;s especially useful in the hands of someone as intelligent as Uryu. Ichigo, however, has gotten some major power-ups of his own since they last spoke, reforging his Zanpakuto and undergoing some brutal training in the Soul King&#39;s Palace. Ichigo&#39;s upgraded Bankai has yet to be used on-screen, so it&#39;s impossible to say just how powerful he has become, and whether it will be enough to defeat Uryu. One can&#39;t forget, however, that Uryu has access to Vollstandig and other Quincy powers in addition to his schrift, and that combination of powers makes him extremely formidable.






 Uryu Gets One Of The Many Broken Powers That Appear In Thousand-Year Blood War 
          

As manga readers know, many of the abilities shown by the Sternitters in the Thousand-Year Blood War arc are absolutely broken, or sometimes not explained enough - as is the case with Yhwach&#39;s powers that will be showcased later. Uryu has often struggled to keep up with power creep in Bleach, but with this ability at his disposal, that certainly won&#39;t be a problem any further. As Yhwach&#39;s successor and wielding the Antithesis ability, Uryu has gone from a run-of-the-mill Quincy to one of the Soul Society&#39;s greatest threats in all of Bleach.
