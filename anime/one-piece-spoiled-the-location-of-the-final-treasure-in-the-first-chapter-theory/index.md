## Literature Review

Elusive as the One Piece may be, this popular theory suggests the secret to its location may lie in Roger&#39;s very first lines in the series.





Amongst the innumerable theories about One Piece that have emerged over the years, this one by Youtuber Drop the Pizza, is most convincing. Not only does this theory fit in perfectly with Oda&#39;s tendency to drop subtle hints years in advance, but also agrees with the series&#39; sense of humor and irony. According to this theory, the world of One Piece is literally turned on its side due to a 90-degree shift of the planet&#39;s axis that happened at some point in the past, with the North and South poles shifting positions. This would not only connect an incredible number of mysteries in the series but also reveal the location of the final treasure. Based on this theory, the shifting of the Poles caused catastrophic changes, including a reversal of sea currents.

 The One Piece Is Hidden Underwater   to Loguetown 
          

Hence, Polestar Island (where Loguetown is situated) and Lodestar Island (the last island on the Grand Line) should have switched places. Lodestar would then be actually &#34;Road Start&#34;, while Polestar would be the final destination via the Twin Capes. The names of the two islands also hint at Reverse Mountain being the former North Pole, as &#39;pole star&#39; and &#39;lode star&#39; are often used to refer to the North Star. If so, water levels around Reverse Mountain would have been significantly lower during the past owing to centrifugal force which pushes more water towards the equator than the poles. Loguetown may thus be part of the same submerged landmass that extends across Reverse Mountain. Hence, Laugh Tale as well as the legendary One Piece treasure may actually be underwater or even under Reverse Mountain in a classic &#39;X marks the spot&#39; fashion.




Ironically, that would suggest that Roger searched the entire world for the treasure only to find it near his own hometown on Polestar Island, Loguetown, fittingly known as the town of beginnings and endings. Hence, when Roger said he left his treasure &#39;there&#39; in Chapter #1, he quite literally meant &#39;right there&#39;. While the word &#39;there&#39; may be vague in English, the word Roger uses in Japanese, &#39;Soko,&#39; is very specific and means &#39;right there&#39; or a place relatively near. The treasure being near Loguetown would not only explain why Roger laughed in Chapter #967 but also his sarcastic tone when he referred to the Laugh Tale as the &#39;final island&#39; that no one had been to in 800 years, which was hinted at through the emboldening of the word in the manga.

Laugh Tale being submerged could explain why Roger&#39;s crew might have been too early, and maybe even why the panel explaining the ship coating process at Sabaody is one of Oda&#39;s favorites, assuming the bubble coating is the key to reaching Laugh Tale. Moreover, this possibility also draws attention to the countless submerged islands the Straw Hats have come across on the course of their adventure including Wano, Water Seven, Impel Down, and even Long Ring Long Land.

Laugh Tale may even be an island that only re-emerges when water levels fall every few decades or so. It would certainly be an explosive surprise to find out that the clue to discover the most prized treasure in the world and the biggest secret in One Piece was literally given out in the very first chapter. Nevertheless, only Oda knows what the series has in store for the finale and the location of the final treasure and regardless of how true this theory may or may not be, the ending of One Piece is sure to be epic.
