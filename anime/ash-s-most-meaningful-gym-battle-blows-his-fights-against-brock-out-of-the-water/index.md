# Ash s Most Meaningful Gym Battle Blows His Fights Against Brock Out of the Water


## SUMMARY 



  Clemont&#39;s gym battle with Ash in the Pokémon anime holds deeper significance due to their traveling companionship and the emotional stakes involved.   Unlike other gym leader companions who joined Ash after being defeated, Clemont traveled with Ash for over 60 episodes before their battle.   By placing Clemont&#39;s gym battle later in the series, the match gains more emotional significance for the characters and the audience, making it one of the greatest gym matches in Pokémon anime.

## Literature Review

Ash has traveled with many gym leaders whom he has defeated, but one companion&#39;s gym battle stands out among the rest for its meaning to them.




In the Pokémon anime, Ash has traveled alongside many gym leaders, and has battled against (and defeated) all of them at some point. However, one traveling companion, Clemont, stands out among the other gym leaders, as their battle took place long after the two trainers began traveling together, giving the competition a deeper meaning.




In Pokémon XY, Ash meets up with Clemont, who has been kicked out of his own gym by a robot which he built to help run the place while he was away. Ash is ejected from the gym, as he needs 4 badges to challenge it and has zero when he first arrives. Clemont and his younger sister, Bonnie, decide to travel with Ash, and leave the gym under the robot&#39;s control for a while.

          

Ash eventually helps Clemont to retake the gym and get the robot back into working order, but declines to battle Clemont until he meets that 4-badge requirement. Clemont respects this decision, and the two continue to travel together until Ash has enough badges.

When Ash finally gets enough badges, Clemont realizes that he needs to give Ash the challenge of a lifetime, and parts ways with Ash and his sister temporarily, returning to the gym. During this time, Clemont takes on other challengers and trains his Pokémon to be at peak performance. 67 episodes into the series, in &#34;The Moment of Lumiose Truth,&#34; Ash finally takes on Clemont at his gym, and the two have a battle that gets both trainers fired up. Throughout the match, Clemont and Ash are shown to be thinking about how they wished the fight would never end, and the two pushed each other to new heights. Ash eventually won his badge, and Clemont proudly handed it over, knowing he gave his all.

Against previous gym leader companions, such as Brock and Cilan, they only began traveling with him after he defeated them, so their gym battles didn&#39;t actually have much emotionally at stake for them. Even Misty, who is battled shortly after joining Ash, doesn&#39;t have much at stake in her gym battle, as Misty simply takes the stage from her sisters for the one battle and then goes back to following Ash. For Clemont&#39;s gym battle, viewers have gotten to know him as a character for 60&#43; episodes, and while there&#39;s a desire to see Ash victorious, it&#39;s balanced by fans&#39; feelings towards Clemont as well. It makes the match-up legitimately tense, even as Ash takes a commanding lead.




By putting Clemont&#39;s gym battle relatively late in the series, especially compared to other gym leader companions, the match gains much more emotional significance for the characters, and in turn for the audience. Clemont wanted to be sure that Ash knew he wasn&#39;t just getting a badge because they were friends, and dedicated himself to the idea of challenging Ash, taking his gym leader responsibilities very seriously. Ash, of course, wouldn&#39;t have it any other way, and that makes it that much more satisfying when Ash does eventually win and obtain the badge. As a result, Ash and Clemont&#39;s gym battle stands out as one of the greatest gym matches in the Pokémon anime.
