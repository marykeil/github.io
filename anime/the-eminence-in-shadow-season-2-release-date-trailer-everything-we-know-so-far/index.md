## Literature Review

After the success of its first season, The Eminence in Shadow anime will return in 2023 with a Season 2. Here’s everything we know so far.





The Eminence in Shadow is a Japanese light novel series written by Daisuke Aizawa and illustrated by Tōzai, with a manga adaptation published by Kadokawa, with art by Anri Sakano. The series innovates the bloated isekai landscape in the simplest way possible: by never taking itself too seriously. The charm of The Eminence in Shadow revolves around the protagonist, Cid Kageno, who is the classic overpowered and emotionless isekai protagonist, with one big catch: he does not want to be a protagonist. Cid&#39;s only dream is to be the &#34;Eminence in Shadow&#34;, the mysterious, powerful character that pulls the strings from behind the scenes. To do that, Cid also has to act every day as a weak &#34;mob&#34; character and puts a lot of effort into building this hilarious persona. Season 1 of The Eminence in Shadow was met with great praise, and fans&#39; expectations for Season 2 are as high as ever.

On June 6th 2023, HiDive announced that The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 would premiere at the 2023 Anime Expo on Saturday, July 1st. The English dub of the premiere would then be shown on July 4th at that same event. This represents the first dual world premiere of a sub and dub, showing that Kadokawa is acknowledging the size of the Western fanbase for the show, which means they may continue to hold similar events in the future.

On May 28th, it was revealed on Twitter that the second season of The Eminence in Shadow would release in October 2023. However, while the show will begin airing in October, the premiere episode will be broadcast at Anime Expo 2023, with the sub debuting on July 1st and the dub being shown on July 4th. It is unclear if this debut episode will be available to watch on HiDive after the event, however.






 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Trailers 

 

The latest trailer for season 2 was released on Twitter on May 28th. It gives glimpses of the Lawless City that will be the setting for the second season. The trailer also provided glimpses of some new major characters like the three monarchs of the Lawless City and the vampire hunter Mary, along with their voices. It also hinted at Cid&#39;s goals in the city and revealed that his sister Claire will also play a major part in this season.


 

After the first season finished airing, Kadokawa released a teaser for The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s second season that largely just establishes the premise and setting. While most of the footage in this initial trailer would get reused in the later trailer discussed above, there still are some unique glimpses of characters to come that the second trailer doesn&#39;t show. However, it largely just served as an announcement that Season 2 would be getting adapted sooner than many fans anticipated.






 The Eminence In Shadow Season 2 Story Details 
          

Season 2 of The Eminence in Shadow will see Cid and the Shadow Garden pay a visit to the Lawless City. The synopsis of the third volume of the light novel series, which will be adapted by Season 2 of the anime, is the following:


Deep within the Lawless City lies the Blood Queen, a Progenitor Vampire, slumbering in her coffin for many moons. An expert at landing himself in trouble, Cid should know better than to go after her…but he’s dying to get a piece of the action. It’s time he shed his daytime persona to take on the role of Shadow! It seems, however, that he’s not the only one with this idea. Soon enough, he finds the three rulers of the Lawless City—Juggernaut the Tyrant, Yukime the Spirit Fox, and Crimson the vampire—are all on his tail. To complicate things even further, the Shadow Garden descends on the scene as the hour of the Blood Queen’s awakening looms closer and closer…





In Season 1, Kageno Minoru is a Japanese high-schooler obsessed with becoming a superhero-like figure, who dies in a road accident and is reincarnated in a magical world as Cid Kageno. Using the skills he acquired in his previous life, Cid grows up to become the strongest individual in the world, but he hides it behind a facade of plainness. Meanwhile, Cid frees a number of Elf women from a disfiguring curse and trains them to be deadly warriors, after telling them a made-up story about the evil Cult of Diabolos.

This is all part of Cid&#39;s grand fantasies of playing the Eminence in Shadow, but unknown to him, the Cult really exists, and when the girls leave on their own quest to destroy it, forming the Shadow Garden group, Cid believes they are simply tired of his childish games. For the rest of the series, Cid is essentially playing a huge game, alternating his best &#34;mob&#34; character impressions with the impressive appearances of Shadow, his Eminence in Shadow alter-ego. Meanwhile, the Shadow Garden works to root out the Cult of Diabolos, with Cid getting caught in the action (mostly unaware of what&#39;s truly going on).




                  Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2: Release Date, Trailer, &amp; Everything We Know   Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season is one of the year&#39;s most anticipated anime, and with its release coming soon here&#39;s everything we know about it.   

In Season 2, Cid will join his sister Claire in an expedition with the Magic Swordsmen Association to defeat the Blood Queen in the Lawless City on the eve of the legendary Red Moon event. He will recruit Shadow Garden members to assist him and clash with the powerful Monarchs of the Lawless City, Juggernaut, Yukime, and the Blood Queen herself.
