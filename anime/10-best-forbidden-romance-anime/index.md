## Literature Review

Romance rarely comes without sacrifices and misunderstandings, but forbidden love is even more complicated, which makes these anime so engrossing.





Forbidden love can take place in a variety of contexts, from would-be lovers whose families or even countries are at odds with each other, to those who simply belong to different classes or worlds. Making a relationship work is never easy, as it requires honesty and communication, but all of that only becomes harder when adding the need to navigate complicated backgrounds of rivalry.









 








 10  The Duke of Death and His Maid 
        

The Duke of Death and His Maid revolves around Viktor, more commonly known as Bocchan or the &#34;Duke of Death&#34;, who was cursed as a child with the ability to involuntarily kill anything he touches, and his flirtatious maid, Alice Lendrott, who seems to want to get closer to him, but is unable to due to the curse that keeps them from being able to hold each other. As they get closer and the duke&#39;s feelings for his maid grow in response to her own, so does the frustration caused by the curse increase as well, which is why Bocchan resolves to find a way to cure himself.





 9  Kemonozume 
        

Focusing on a forbidden romance with a mythological twist, Kemonozume follows the relationship between Toshihiko Momota, the son of the leader of Kifuuken, and Yuka Kamitsuki, a Shokujinki. Though neither of them is aware of the other&#39;s real identity when they fall in love, Yuka is able to transform into a monstrous beast who needs to consume humans to survive, while Toshihiko is a skilled swordsman sworn to kill her and her kind. Such a relationship may seem impossible to form and develop, but true love always finds a way, no matter how many efforts and sacrifices it may take.





 8  Kamisama Kiss 
        

The forbidden romance of Kamisama Kiss occurs between the two main characters, Nanami Momozono and Tomoe. Nanami is a girl who, following a strange series of events, ends up acting as a local deity. Her new position comes with a variety of things to learn and issues to face, such as the troubling nature of youkai and spirits that become a part of her daily life. But perhaps the biggest issue is that of her growing feelings towards her new familiar, Tomoe, a hot-headed fox who refuses the notion of serving a human. Although humans and demons are not typically able to be together, the two simply cannot avoid their fate.





 7  Snow White with the Red Hair 
        

Snow White with the Red Hair&#39;s titular protagonist is Shirayuki, an ordinary and cheerful girl who works earnestly as an apothecary at a herbal shop. What sets her apart from others is her bright red hair, which even the prince of her country takes an interest in, attempting to force her to become his concubine. Unhappy with this idea, Shirayuki cuts off her long red hair and runs away, somehow ending up being rescued by the prince of a neighboring country. Although she finds his attitude unpleasant at first, the two fall in love with each other gradually, but the difference in status between a royal and a commoner cannot be ignored.

While female leads in manga are historically rare, stronger female characters that share a common connection are proving themselves worthy leaders.








 6  Lull of the Sea 
        

In the series&#39; world, all humans used to live beneath the sea, but things started to change as some took an interest in the surface. Over time, they grew fond of life above the sea and lost the ability to breathe underwater, leading to a rift being formed between the denizens of the ocean and the others. Lull of the Sea follows the story of four such students, who are forced to attend school on the surface after theirs closes down, encountering discrimination along the way. Multiple romance possibilities are explored, but one of the central ones is between Tsumugu Kihara and Chisaki Hiradaira, a relationship defined by the obstacles caused by their differences.





 5  Basilisk 
        

Basilisk follows two powerful ninja clans, Iga and Kouga, who have always been at odds with each other, knowing nothing but conflict. After Ieyasu Tokugawa orders a ceasefire, the situation between the clans finally seems to get better, with their respective heirs Oboro and Gennosuke, falling in love with each other and hoping to get married, in an attempt to ensure peace. However, fate is not so kind to them, and their clans end up in yet another war before they can announce their plans, which forces them to keep their relationship secret and act in accordance with the expectations that others have for them.





 4  Boarding School Juliet 
        

The events of Boarding School Juliet take place in the Dahlia Academy, where students of two opposing countries live in separate dorms and study together. As Juliet Persia is the leader of the House White Cat, and Romio Inuzuka is the head prefect of the Black Dogs, the two are supposed to be archenemies. However, in spite of their expected rivalry, they are actually hopelessly in love with each other, a fact that no one in their school could possibly understand or accept. Though the reality of their situation certainly makes their relationship difficult, but nothing is enough to stop their love from blossoming.





 3  Beastars 
        

Given that Beastars revolves around anthropomorphic animals, the differences between characters may not easily be linked to reality, but they can certainly make for interesting parallels. Though all kinds of animals study together at Cherryton Academy, the tension between carnivores and herbivores is always present, and the situation only gets worse after the death of an alpaca, which leads to the innocent Legoshi falling under suspicion. Legoshi - a wolf - also falls in love with Haru, a white dwarf rabbit, but the differences between them make their relationship complicated and difficult to navigate. Regardless of what their instincts tell them though, they are determined to be together.

Far from a gimmick, Beastars uses its animal characters as a larger metaphor for forbidden love, cementing it as one of manga&#39;s greatest romances.








 2  Love After World Domination 
        

Love After World Domination revolves around Fudou Aikawa, the &#34;Red Gelato&#34; and leader of a group of heroes fighting evil to protect Japan, and Desumi Magahara, the &#34;Reaper Princess&#34; and one of Gekkko&#39;s most powerful combatants, fighting on the side of villains with the aim of world domination. Although they should be mortal enemies, they end up falling in love with each other, which leads to them trying to get closer to each other while hiding the truth from everyone else. Moreover, as this is their first experience with romance, they have a lot of room to learn and grow together.





 1  Romeo x Juliet 
        

As a retelling of a classic work, William Shakespeare&#39;s famous play, Romeo x Juliet follows two star-crossed lovers, Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet and Romeo Candorebanto Montague. After Juliet&#39;s family is slaughtered by the Montagues seeking to seize control over the kingdom, she is hidden away and grows up with no knowledge of her past, but maintains a strict sense of justice, occasionally acting as a hero under the guise of the costumed Red Whirlwind. Meeting Romeo by chance, whose kindness and selflessness couldn&#39;t be further apart from his father, the two fall in love at first sight, unaware of the struggles they are to face should they continue to get closer.
Some of the couples on this list have to deal with class-related issues, as their royal status may not allow them to be seen with someone with a less noble background. Others must figure out how to reconcile differences that extend far beyond what they are in control of, owing to their contrasting natures and environments. Regardless of what fate has in store for them, they all know the importance of love and the value of pursuing what matters to them in spite of any obstacles, which is what makes forbidden anime romances as engrossing as they are.
