## Literature Review

The manga adaptation of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero has finally fixed an important issue with Gohan&#39;s character..




Spoilers for Dragon Ball Super Chapter 100!The Dragon Ball Super manga has just finished adapting the movie Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, and the final pages of chapter #100 contain an extra scene not seen in the film that finally fixes a big issue with Gohan. Dragon Ball Super has taken the opportunity to turn Gohan into a far better person than he was before these events began.




Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero story has been applauded by fans since it finally brings Gohanâ€™s character back into the spotlight after years of being unjustly sidelined. While the manga remained mostly faithful to the script of the movie, a few, short original scenes were added, including one between Gohan and Pan at the end of chapter #100.

          

After Gohan unleashed his Beast form to defeat Cell Max, with the help of Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks, the team goes back home in Bulma&#39;s airplane. Gohan holds a sleeping Pan in his arms and admits he has been an absent father, promising he will do better in the future.

The Super Hero story saw Gohan being completely absorbed in his work as a researcher, neglecting not only his training (as he often does) but, more importantly, his daughter. Piccolo had to step up and help not just with day-to-day duties, such as picking up Pan from school, but also with her training. It was surely not a good look for Gohan, who seemingly was following in Goku&#39;s footsteps as an absent father completely focused on his obsessions.

Surely, during the story, Gohan fought through the Red Ribbon&#39;s new androids and Cell Max to save Pan, but that&#39;s only because Piccolo set up her fake kidnapping to give him a jolt. This is why this added scene is a treat for fans as not only does it effectively cap off a story that saw Pan taken from Gohan, leading him to fight against impossible odds to get her back, but also forces Gohan to rethink his relationship with his daughter.

While some fans have been critical of the Super Hero Arc due to its lack of original content, this added scene was actually perfect because not only it gave the movie&#39;s storyline a more satisfying ending, but also set up the future development of Gohan as a character. Now that Gohan is officially the strongest fighter, it will be interesting to see if Dragon Ball Super will truly give him a more important role in the future, in which case, he will surely benefit from the character growth displayed at the end of the Super Hero Arc.
