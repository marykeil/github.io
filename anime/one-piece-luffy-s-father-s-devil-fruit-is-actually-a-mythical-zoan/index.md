# One Piece Luffy s Father s Devil Fruit Is Actually A Mythical Zoan


## SUMMARY 



  One Piece may have already hinted at Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit being a Mythical Zoan modeled after the thunderbird, explaining his ability to control not just wind but also thunder, lightning, and storms.   References to Native American culture and the thunderbird can be found in the symbols of the Freedom Fighters and the Revolutionary Army, as well as Dragon&#39;s tattoo, adding further support to the theory.   The thunderbird has appeared explicitly in One Piece before, suggesting that it may exist as a myth within the series, making the possibility of a Zoan Devil Fruit modeled after it plausible.

## Literature Review

One Piece already told fans everything they need to know to figure out Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit, and it may be a Mythical Zoan instead of a Logia.




One Piece may have already left all the clues to Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit, and it may actually be a Mythical Zoan instead of a Wind Logia as popularly believed. Moreover, the proof may have been staring fans in the face all along and could potentially explain many of the biggest mysteries about Dragon.




According to a popular theory proposed by X users @writingpanini and @breaking2good, Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit may be a Mythical Zoan modeled after the thunderbird, a mythical creature of great power that can control not only thunder and lightning but also the wind and storms. The thunderbird is a significant aspect of Native American culture and mythology and the possibility of Dragon possessing a Devil Fruit modeled after it would better explain the several instances Dragon has been seen affecting the weather as a whole, as opposed to a wind-based Logia fruit.


 

As far-fetched as it may sound, One Piece appears to have already made several discreet references to the thunderbird and Native American culture, with clues hidden in the symbols of the Freedom Fighters and the Revolutionary Army, as well as Dragon&#39;s tattoo, which has mystified fans for ages.





 The Thunderbird Has Made Several Appearances in One Piece 
          

The symbol that appears on the sails of the Freedom Fighters&#39; ship in chapter #1097 bears a striking resemblance to the thunderbird as popularly seen on totem poles. If Dragon does indeed have the ability to turn into the mythical creature as theorized, it would make perfect sense for the symbol of the Freedom Fighters to be modeled after it seeing as Dragon is the head of the group. Moreover, this bird motif seems to have also carried over to the symbol of the Revolutionary Army.

The logo of the Revolutionary Army, particularly the symbol in the center, appears to be a rendition of the thunderbird with similar wings sprouting out on either side. The art style of the symbol also resembles that of Native American illustrations, further hinting at Native American culture being the inspiration behind Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit. Most importantly, the thunderbird itself is far from a foreign concept within One Piece and has already made an explicit appearance as one of Enel&#39;s attacks during Skypiea. Thus, there is a possibility that the thunderbird exists as a myth within the series, making the existence of a Zoan Devil Fruit modeled after it a possibility as well.




               :   One Piece Confirms A Major Theory About Luffy&#39;s Father   After years in the shadows, One Piece has finally revealed a key detail about Dragon that confirms one of the biggest theories about him.   



 Dragon&#39;s Tattoo Is Tied To the Thunderbird 
          

Interestingly, the Native American origins of the thunderbird might also explain the mystery of Dragon&#39;s peculiar tattoo, which has been the object of many theories since his introduction. As @writingpanini points out, Dragon&#39;s tattoo appears to be inspired by the style of tattoos of the Algonquian peoples, which also believed in the thunderbird. That said, seeing as Dragon acquired his infamous tattoo at some point during the eight years after Kuma joined the Freedom Fighters and before Ginny was captured, it is difficult to say for certain what significance it has or how it could be tied to his Devil Fruit.






 Dragon&#39;s Powers May Surpass Controlling the Wind 
          

Though fans have popularly theorized that Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit is a Logia, the simple fact that Dragon was able to control not just the winds but also the rain and lightning seems to contradict the assumption. Luffy was saved by a well-placed strike of lightning at Loguetown, and it seems unlikely that a wind-based Logia would allow Dragon that sort of ability. Additionally, with Mythical Zoans presently establishing their dominance in the series, there couldn&#39;t be a more fitting power for the formidable head of the Revolutionaries. Still, One Piece has always had a penchant for the unpredictable, so it is impossible to say what the series will bring.

One Piece is available from Manga Plus and Viz Media.
