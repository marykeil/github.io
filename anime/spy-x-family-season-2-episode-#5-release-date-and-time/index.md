 What Happened In Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #4? 
          




Season 2, Episode #4 of Spy x Family gave fans the cutest Damian-Anya interaction yet and an intense battle for a rumored magical pastry said to make all who eat it an Imperial Scholar. With only four pastries left and five people to divide it among Anya, Becky, Damian, and his friends decide to eliminate the odd one out using a classic game of cards. With only Anya and Damian left in the final round, Damian finds himself moved by Anya&#39;s adorable teary face and loses the game on purpose. Anya gets the famed pastry but to her and Loid&#39;s chagrin, Anya&#39;s grades see no improvement.

Episode #4 also gives fans a glimpse of Franky&#39;s troublesome love life as he dedicates all his resources to finding a lost cat in hopes of impressing its owner, a woman named Kacey who works at his favorite cafe. With a little help from Yor, Franky eventually succeeds in getting a hold of the cat only to find out the woman he hoped to impress already has a partner. Wounded by the experience Franky vows to dedicate his life only to work going forward.
