## Literature Review

My Hero Academia is a phenomenon all its own at this point, but there are lots of other fantastic anime about superheroes that are worth checking out.




When it comes to superhero anime, My Hero Academia is the main series that&#39;s likely to come to mind for fans. Yet, there are still many other anime series about superheroes, or people with special powers and costumes who fight crime. While it&#39;s tempting to say that the best superhero anime are adaptations of Western Comics, this ignores the many unique properties that are wholly their own thing.
Superheroes might not be the first thing that comes to mind when fans think of anime, but the DNA of classic comics is well woven into modern anime. Most modern Tokusatsu can actually trace its origins back to a Japanese Spider-Man TV series, strangely enough, and there&#39;s a reason heroes such as Goku are often compared to Superman. Still, the very best superhero anime take the basic concepts of superhero stories and give them a fresh perspective that marks them as wholly different than their Western counterparts.









 








 10  Astro Boy (1963) 
Based on the manga by Osamu Tezuka
        

  Number of Episodes   193    Where to Stream   Funimation    
It&#39;s impossible to have a list of Japanese superheroes without mentioning Astro Boy. Created by the grandfather of manga, Osamu Tezuka, Astro Boy was one of the first anime to exist, even if it&#39;s very different from the modern incarnation. Set in the then-distant future of 2013, Astro Boy starts with Dr. Tenma, who lost his only son in a car accident, and recreates a robot in the boy&#39;s image, Atom. While Dr. Tenma ultimately betrays Atom, the young robot soon finds a new mentor in the form of Professor Ochanomizu, who encourages him to use his powers for good. Astro Boy was revolutionary and popular around the world, kicking off a 60&#43; year legacy, recently reignited with the successful series Pluto. As one of the earliest anime hits, it&#39;s no understatement to say that anime would not be what it is today without Astro Boy.





 9  SSSS.Gridman (2018) 
Based on the television series by Tsuburaya Productions
        

  Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream   Funimation, Crunchyroll    
Inspired by the Ultraman series, SSSS.Gridman is equal parts giant robot and superhero. Yuta, a boy in a strange city, awakens with no memory of his life and soon finds that he now has the power to enter an old computer, after which he manifests as Gridman, a Hyper Agent responsible for defending cyberspace. Yuta and Gridman fight off attacking Kaiju as Yuta attempts to regain his memory, unraveling the mysteries of the city in the process. While short, the series is absolutely fascinating and is a clear celebration of Japanese superhero series like Ultraman.





 8  Heroman (2010) 
Based on the manga by Stan Lee
        

  Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
Heroman isn&#39;t an adaptation of a Western property, but it was created by one prominent figure in Western Superhero fiction: Stan Lee. The series follows a young orphan who lives on the West Coast of the US, Joey Jones, who longs for a robot known as a Heybo. He finds a broken one and fixes it up, but then the Heybo is struck by lightning, causing it to transform into a giant robot. Now it&#39;s up to Joey and the new robot, dubbed Heroman, to protect the Earth as evil aliens known as the Skrugg begin their assault on the planet. The series is a bit goofy, without question, but it&#39;s still worth checking out for fans of superheroes as a unique project by a legend. The series is also animated by Bones, the same studio as My Hero Academia.





 7  Zetman (2012) 
Based on the manga created by Masakazu Katsura
        

  Number of Episodes   13    Where to Stream   Amazon Prime Video    
Zetman is a darker, more serious take on superheroes than most of the other entries on this list. Zetman opens with a conflict between two superheroes, ZET and Alphas, before going back to explore how it all came to be. ZET uses a bestial transformation to become the superpowered persona, like the Hulk, while Alphas makes use of technology to fight crime, more similar to Iron Man. Both are tasked with defending the city from attacks by Players, monsters created through unethical scientific experimentation. The series is full of twists and turns, resulting in a series that certainly succeeds in setting itself apart.





 6  Charlotte (2015) 
Original series written by Jun Maeda and produced by P.A. Works


 







  Number of Episodes   13&#43;1 OVA    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Crunchyroll    
Charlotte is set in a world where a comet (the eponymous Charlotte) approaches once every 75 years and grants children superpowers. However, these superpowers are highly limited in their application, either by the effort required or just hard limits on the amount of time the power can be used. Series protagonist Yuu Otosaka, for example, is capable of possessing another person, but only for five seconds. As a result, Charlotte has one of the most unique takes on superpowers in anime, as their limited nature requires that characters work together in order to succeed, even when they don&#39;t normally get along.





 5  Darker than Black (2007) 
Original series written by Tensai Okamura &amp; produced by Bones
        

  Number of Episodes   37&#43;5 OVAs    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime Video    
Incidentally made by Studio Bones just like My Hero Academia, Darker than Black begins when a bizarre location known as the Hell&#39;s Gate appears in Tokyo and a Heaven&#39;s Gate appears in South America simultaneously. Certain individuals, known as Contractors, were affected by the appearance of the Hell&#39;s Gate, granting them incredible powers at the cost of their emotions and conscience. The existence of Contractors is kept secret from the public, but the governments of the world have no problem using these superpowered individuals as spies and hitmen.
Darker than Black has a fairly unique take on superpowers, as each contractor has a special price they must pay after using their powers; sometimes it takes the form of a compulsion, such as the need to break one&#39;s fingers, or it can trigger automatically. Hiei and those around him must answer what it means to be human as they deal with threats and uncover the mystery of the Hell&#39;s Gate.
Fans of Darker Than Black might also enjoy creator Tensai Okamura&#39;s other well-known series, Cowboy Bebop, which is available from Crunchyroll and Hulu. 






 4  S-CRY-ed (2001) 
Original series written by Yosuke Kuroda &amp; produced by Sunrise
        

  Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
This little-known series from the early 2000s is a bizarre anime take on the idea of mutants who suddenly appear in the world, like Marvel&#39;s X-Men. A sudden disaster occurred which turned part of Japan into a territory known as the &#34;Lost Ground,&#34; which incidentally triggers a small percentage of the population born under these circumstances to develop powers. These individuals, known as Alter Users, can gather matter and energy around them and use it to transform into the Alter, a manifestation of their powers.
The abilities that Alter Users can have are wild and unpredictable, like turning any car pink, clairvoyance, or Green Lantern-esque energy constructs. The series&#39; conflict isn&#39;t so much based on good versus evil as it is order versus chaos, making both protagonist Kazuma and antagonist Ryuuhou very understandable characters.





 3  Tiger &amp; Bunny (2011) 
Original series created by Masayuki Ozaki and produced by Sunrise &amp; B.N. Pictures


 







  Number of Episodes   50    Where to Stream   Hulu, Netflix, Hoopla    
Set in a futuristic city, Tiger &amp; Bunny sees special individuals born with powers known as NEXT, becoming heroes and using those powers for good, at least most of the time. Powers in this series tend to be a bit more conventional, but only a little; what really sets Tiger &amp; Bunny apart is its setting, Sternbild City. Sternbild straddles the line between utopia and dystopia, with its heroes forced to work under the Hero TV banner, making sponsorships and ratings a major factor that complicates their ability to fight crime. In that sense, it&#39;s arguably one of the more realistic takes on superheroes, as most superhero media completely glosses over how crime fighters fund their operations.
Kotetsu, AKA Wild Tiger, the main character, struggles with this the most since he&#39;s known for causing a lot of collateral damage, a fact that eventually sees him paired up with Barnaby, AKA Bunny. Tiger &amp; Bunny has an excellent grasp on its characters, with its second season especially focusing on the importance of relationships.





 2  The Big O (1999) 
Original series written by Chiaki J. Konaka and Kazuyoshi Katayama &amp; produced by Sunrise
        

  Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Currently unavailable on streaming    
What if Batman used a giant mecha to fight crime? The Big O, very consciously modeled after the 90&#39;s Batman: The Animated Series, answers that question by putting wealthy negotiator Roger Smith in the pilot&#39;s seat of Big O, a mysterious mecha that answers his call through a special wristwatch. Roger lives in a weird place known as Paradigm City, a town with no past and whose future constantly teeters on the brink of destruction.
The Big O even features something of a rogues&#39; gallery, with different opponents like Alex Rosewater or Schwarzvald taking on roles comparable to those of Western comic villains, like Lex Luthor or the Joker. Despite its somewhat brazen emulation of Batman, The Big O sets itself apart by focusing on big ideas like the meaning of memory and the importance of identity, and these big ideas come to dominate the series by its ending.
Chiaki J. Konaka&#39;s other notable works include Serial Experiments Lain and Hellsing, both of which are available on Funimation. 






 1  One-Punch Man (2015) 
Based on the manga created by ONE &amp; Yusuke Murata 


 







  Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Netflix    
While it may ultimately be a satire of overpowered heroes who could easily solve any problem, One-Punch Man is actually a pretty amazing superhero show all on its own. The show has a wide roster of heroes, ranging from the street-tier Mumen Rider, who has no powers besides general athleticism and a bicycle, up to the powerful S-class, made up of characters with incredible abilities like Tatsumaki&#39;s psychic powers.
Protagonist Saitama is a surprisingly interesting character, in that his strength just leaves him feeling bored all the time, and yet he&#39;s still set on using it to help people in need, even if it&#39;s never as entertaining as he hopes it will be. With a new season 3 of One-Punch Man&#39;s anime on the way, there&#39;s never been a better time to dive in and get caught up, especially since the manga arc it will be adapting astonished fans with its quality last year.
While there are lots of other anime series that feature characters who could be considered superheroes, such as the entire magical girl genre, the series above most closely match what a Western viewer would recognize as superheroes. Each also manages to set itself apart from My Hero Academia by zeroing in on different aspects of what makes a superhero story a superhero story, ranging from bizarre mutants to badass ordinary dudes with the keys to a mecha.
