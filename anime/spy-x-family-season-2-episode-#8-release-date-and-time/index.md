 What Happened In Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #7? 
          




Season 2, Episode #7 of Spy x Family resumed Yor&#39;s fight against the assassin in the hallway. Just as a concerned crowd begins to gather, Anya dispels suspicions by framing the fight as a circus performance. Yor makes quick work of the man without drawing any more suspicion. Anya then returns to Loid who emerges from the fitting room in all his glory in an assortment of gift shop merchandise hoping to finally excite Anya, only for her to be utterly unimpressed, leaving Loid dejected once again.

Meanwhile, Yor successfully relocates her clients to their new room and the episode gives viewers a brief flashback into Olka&#39;s relationship with the man acting as her husband. Yor&#39;s superior, the Director, then returns and asks Yor to focus on the mission and stay alert. As Yor guards the door through the night, she comes to the realization that she hesitated during the fight in the hallway as she did not want to blow her cover and lose her precarious relationship with Loid and Anya.




As morning arrives, the episode cuts to Loid, who is consoling himself and coming to terms with being unable to understand Anya despite being the great spy Twilight. Anya wakes up determined to help Yor but hilariously fails to ditch Loid despite many attempts. Annoyed at her failure, Anya scowls throughout dinner, further confusing poor Loid who thought she&#39;d had a fun day. Anya uses her psychic powers to hear Loid&#39;s troubled thoughts and claims she simply misses Yor. Loid then promises the three will spend the day together on the last day of the cruise. Elsewhere, Yor and her clients prepare to execute the escape plan, while the assassins on the cruise ship take their places, ready to intercept them.



 Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #8 Will Conclude Yor&#39;s Mission 
          

Season 2 Episode #8 of Spy x Family is titled, &#39;The Symphony Upon the Ship / Sis&#39; Herb Tea&#39; and will likely finally conclude Yor&#39;s mission on the cruise ship as she attempts to ensure her clients&#39; successful escape. The episode is sure to be packed to the brim with action as Yor deals with the rest of the assassins aboard the ship. As strong as Yor may be, this final battle will put Yor&#39;s abilities to the test as she will likely have to fight assassins of every shape and size wielding every kind of weapon imaginable, giving fans the chance to see Thorn Princess in all her glory.




Fans can also expect to see glimpses of Loid and Anya as Yor&#39;s battle rages on. Perhaps Anya will lend a helping hand once again as well. Either way, the episode is sure to be just as delightful as Spy x Family always is.

Don&#39;t miss Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #8 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 25, 2023.
