## Literature Review

In part because of how weird the Real World story arc is, it stands out as the high point of the original anime series&#39; run.





Despite many weird moments of this Reverse Isekai storyline and an underlying sense of confusion as to how Digital Monsters can exist in the Real World, the arc has the highest stakes in the series so far. Up to this point, Digimon Adventure was ramping up the stakes and the threats to the Digital World, Myotismon&#39;s invasion of the Real World in pursuit of the eighth DigiDestined represents the first quantifiable threat to the Real World. In the span of 30 episodes, the DigiDestined have gone from fighting a villain in control of a single island in the Digital World in the form of Devimon, to fighting Myotismon, who quickly establishes himself as a clear threat to Tokyo and the entire Real World. These much higher stakes compared to earlier episodes allow for some truly memorable moments in the heroes&#39; fight with Myotismon.

Myotismon himself is a solid villain to build a story arc around. Although the logistics behind his invasion of the Real World with an army of digital beings create conceptual issues that are never really addressed, there&#39;s at least a broad underlying logic behind his plan to hunt down the eighth DigiDestined. He&#39;s pragmatic, proactive, and ruthless. He&#39;s also literally portrayed as operating with all the typical characteristics of a vampire, up to and including going around at night to feed on blood. He&#39;s imposing and a genuine threat even before he Digivolves into his final VenomMyotismon form and requires the combined powers of all eight DigiDestined, an ancient prophecy, and the new Mega-level Digivolutions for Greymon and Garurumon, unlocked by the fulfillment of said prophecy.

Meanwhile, the heroes&#39; own plot line through the Real World arc is among Digimon Adventure&#39;s most compelling. It does feel enough obvious that the heroes should have clued into Kari being the eighth DigiDestined a lot sooner. In the English dub, the fact that the eighth DigiDestined is only ever referred to as &#34;he&#34; before the reveal does feel obvious in hindsight as deliberate misdirection about the eighth DigiDestined&#39;s true identity as a girl. The highlight of the heroes&#39; journey during the story arc is Gatomon&#39;s gradual growth into a hero, bonding with Kari as the partner Digimon of the eighth DigiDestined and turning against Myotismon. The payoff of Gatomon&#39;s hero turn creates an unforgettable moment. She Digivolves in Angemon and destroys Myotismon&#39;s original form, and then plays a crucial role in empowering Greymon and Garurumon to unlock their Mega Digivolutions and defeat VenomMyotismon. This reflects the series&#39; long-standing trend that when one of the Angel Digimon Digivolves, something awesome is guaranteed to happen.






 The Real World Arc Is The Best Digimon Adventures Story 
          

Although the Reverse Isekai angle of the Real World story arc creates lingering issues that never really make sense and is thoroughly weird because of it, the arc is the series&#39; best. The story is driven by an interesting villain and contains multiple awesome moments for the heroes. The Real World story arc stands out as a highlight of the original Digmon series.
