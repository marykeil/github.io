## Literature Review

Gear 5 Luffy has finally bested a Marine Admiral on Egghead Island with a new attack that proves how much the Straw Hat Captain has grown.





The battle on Egghead Island continues to escalate in unexpected ways with Luffy and Admiral Kizaru&#39;s ongoing large-scale battle. Gear 5&#39;s arsenal of powerfully wacky attacks has finally landed a considerable hit against Admiral Kizaru in chapter #1094 of One Piece. Just as the Straw Hat Captain was charging up a punch, the Admiral shot a laser toward Luffy, who used the momentum from the laser attack to accelerate his punch even further to deliver a new attack: Gum-Gum Star Gun attack, so named because it makes its victim literally &#34;see stars&#34;. The attack landed a considerable blow to Kizaru&#39;s head while also solidifying how much Luffy has grown in the past 2 years.





 Luffy Avenges His Loss Against Kizaru With Gear 5&#39;s New Crazy Attack 
          

Admiral Kizaru and the Straw Hats first encountered each other on the Sabody Archipelago, after the Admiral was summoned because Luffy defended his friend by punching a World Nobile in the face. This transgression summoned the World Government&#39;s wrath, and Kizaru&#39;s Logia Devil Fruit powers that enable him to become and control light completely destroyed the Straw Hats crew. Without the interference of Kuma and Silvers Rayleigh, Kizaru would have killed Zoro and Luffy and likely captured the rest of the Straw Hats. However, a lot has happened since, and the current situation on Egghead is the chance to prove the Straw Hats&#39; growth.

The forced separation of Luffy&#39;s crew in Sabaody and his experience at Marineford greatly influenced the decision to train for two years to grow strong enough to accomplish the Straw Hat crew&#39;s dreams. Kizaru&#39;s ability to control light and the other fearsome Logia Devil Fruit powers displayed by the Admirals set a high bar of strength that Luffy knew would need to be surpassed to become King of the Pirates. The punch that hit Kizaru is similar to the one that struck Kaido, which showed Gear 5&#39;s true power: by making his opponents&#39; heads stretch when it, the following rubber band-like recoil inflicts even more damage than Luffy&#39;s Conqueror Haki-charged punch already does.




          

It&#39;s safe to say that the Straw Hat Pirates are tough enough to stand toe to toe with the strongest fighters the World Government can send against them. Kizaru&#39;s appearance during the Sabody Archipelago arc was one of the most tragic moments for Luffy and his crew. Still, it helped the Straw Hats develop their abilities to a level that was desperately needed in the New World. Kizaru is likely not down for good, and a new threat worse than the Admirals is already Vegapunk and the Straw Hats: Saint Saturn&#39;s true Devil Fruit form. Still, with just one punch, One Piece managed to show its readers how powerful Luffy has become thanks to Gear 5, and also to finally avenge the Straw Hats&#39; biggest loss.
