## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most shocking moment so far in the Shibuya Incident arc has revealed that its main antagonist isn&#39;t who many fans thought.





In a shocking twist, Jujutsu Kaisen has revealed that its main antagonist Geto is not actually who fans thought they were. This twist completely recontextualizes everything that has occurred before this point and sets up exciting new mysteries for the future. It also makes beating the villain much more difficult to do.




In Season 2 Episode #9, Geto finally made his presence known in the Shibuya Incident by stepping out of the shadows to trap Gojo in the Prison Realm. After the movie Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and the Gojo&#39;s Past arc delved a bit deeper into his motivations, fans thought they knew what to expect from him, but they weren&#39;t prepared for his true nature. After a shocked Gojo demanded to hear the truth about Geto, the sorcerer revealed that he wasn&#39;t Geto at all, but a body-hijacking sorcerer who had taken control of his body. This was a shocking twist, but it made some other mysteries make sense, like Geto&#39;s apparent death at Jujutsu Kaisen 0&#39;s end.


 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Geto No Longer Has His Original Brain 
          

This reveal leaves fans with a lot of questions about the new Geto&#39;s plans and motivations. The Gojo&#39;s Past arc firmly established Geto&#39;s motivations, painting him as a radical sorcerer who viewed nonsorcerers as disgusting monkeys to be eradicated. This reached its natural culmination in the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie as he enacted a plan to wipe out vast swathes of humans and claim Yuta&#39;s powerful curse Rika for his own. It also appeared to match the callous disregard for humans he displayed in the anime&#39;s first season. Yet there were also notable differences with how he behaved in the first season that the show has now gloriously revealed.




Now that fans know Geto isn&#39;t the main villain, there is very little they know about them. It appears that the sorcerer jumped into Geto&#39;s body to more easily trap Gojo in the prison Realm, so this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean their plans align. However, it seems that the body-snatching sorcerer does at least share a similarly derogatory view of humans, being willing to kill any number of them to accomplish these goals (whatever those may be). Also given that the body-snatching sorcerer can use Geto&#39;s cursed technique, the danger that Geto represented is still preserved with this new sorcerer as well.



 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident Arc Will Feature Even More Twists 
          

The coming episodes of the Shibuya Incident arc will likely reveal more about this body-swapping sorcerer. However, the fact that the series committed to a twist of this magnitude is a sign that this arc will likely have many more twists and reveals before it ends. This is exciting as it promises to upend the status quo of Jujutsu Kaisen, bringing the series into uncharted territories and setting it apart from other more predictable Shonen battle series.
