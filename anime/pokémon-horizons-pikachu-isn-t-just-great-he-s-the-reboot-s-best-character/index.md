## Literature Review

Even early on in Pokémon Horizons, it&#39;s immediately clear that Captain Pikachu will be a highlight.





As the most prominent Pokémon in Professor Friede&#39;s crew, Captain Pikachu gets the most time to shine, and he&#39;s written as the Pokémon crew member with the most personality. This gives him plenty of opportunities to win over the audience and prove himself as the best new character in Pokémon Horizons. Although his headwear makes him instantly recognizable, Captain Pikachu proves himself to be so much more than just a Pikachu with a new hat.

While Pokémon Horizons goes its own way, it still pays tribute to the spirit of the original Pokémon series. This balance between the old and new is best captured by Captain Pikachu. Comparisons to Ash&#39;s Pikachu will be inevitable, and the writers of Pokémon Horizons seem to recognize this potential pitfall. The writers have also done well to avoid it in early episodes. Part of the reason Captain Pikachu is so memorable is because of how he breaks the mold set by Ash&#39;s Pikachu to differentiate himself as a character.

While Captain Pikachu and Ash&#39;s Pikachu share the superficial similarity that they primarily stay outside a Poké Ball, they don&#39;t have that much else in common on a deeper level. The original Pokémon was as much about Pikachu&#39;s journey as Ash&#39;s journey, so Pikachu did as much growing as Ash did. Like Ash, Pikachu started out as an inexperienced novice who slowly grew into a Master. As the partner Pokémon of an experienced Pokémon Professor, Captain Pikachu is a capable, veteran battler, with potentially unique special abilities that Ash&#39;s Pikachu didn&#39;t. This is reflected in Captain Pikachu&#39;s demeanor. His default pose is standing with his arms crossed, and his default expression is a smug, self-assured smirk. Captain Pikachu is cool, and he&#39;s written and animated to make it clear that he knows it.




Also worth noting is Captain Pikachu&#39;s first on-screen battle in Pokémon Horizons. When facing off with the villainous member of the Explorers Amethio&#39;s Ceruledge, a powerful fully evolved Pokémon, Captain Pikachu outmaneuvers his opponent and attacks in a sequence that looks like something out of Dragon Ball Z. Despite his small size and status as a mid-level evolution, Captain Pikachu proves himself to be a powerhouse and makes an introduction that would be impressive for any Pokémon, let alone one as famously cute as a Pikachu.

In putting a new spin on the character archetype introduced by Ash&#39;s Pikachu, Captain Pikachu makes a memorable first appearance. Captain Pikachu could have just been presented as merely Pikachu with a hat, instead, he&#39;s a cool and instantly compelling new character. Even in the early episodes, Captain Pikachu has proven that he is the best new character in Pokémon Horizons.
