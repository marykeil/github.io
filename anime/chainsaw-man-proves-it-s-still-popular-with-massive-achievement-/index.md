Although Chainsaw Man&#39;s hype and popularity surely contributed to the amount of views, a big part of this success was the quality of the opening itself. Kenshi Yonezu is one of the biggest artists in the anime industry, performing hits such as &#34;Peace Sign&#34; from My Hero Academia and &#34;Orion&#34; from Sangatsu no Lion. The visuals were also incredible, having many references to popular American movies such as Pulp Fiction, The Big Lebowski, Fight Club, and more. These factors all added together to produce one of the best opening songs, worthy of the adaptation of one of the biggest Shōnen series.






Kenshi Yonezu also drew the poster for the song.




“KICK BACK” was also the first song with Japanese lyrics to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. It was also Billboard&#39;s 149th most popular song of 2023. The dark and chaotic nature of the song and composition encapsulated the nature of the violent and bloody anime. With how popular Chainsaw Man&#39;s &#34;KICK BACK&#34; was, fans will definitely see the talented Kenshi Yonezu secure the rights to perform more opening songs in the future.
