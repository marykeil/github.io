## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1085 will likely feature the Straw Hat Pirates finally leaving Wano and moving onto whatever island the next arc will focus on.




After some great anime original content, it seems like the Straw Hats are finally ready to leave Wano in One Piece episode #1085. While Wano was an incredible arc, it was also extremely long and it will be refreshing to see what the series has planned next. If that next storyline is anywhere near as good as Wano was, then One Piece fans are in for a great time.





 What Time One Piece Episode #1085 Releases 
          

One Piece episode #1085, titled &#34;The Last Curtain! Luffy and Momonosuke&#39;s Vow&#34; will air on Sunday, November 26 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 25 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, November 26 at 3:00 a.m. British Summer Time (BST) for One Piece fans in the UK. Fans of the English dub will have to wait for that version to premiere on Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Episode #1084 of One Piece? 
          




Episode #1084 showed off more of what the Straw Hats did before leaving Wano than One Piece&#39;s manga did, making it largely anime-original content. While that technically makes this filler, it was still very satisfying to watch. Luffy was able to talk to the Scabbards and Minks before he left with his crew and he also made sure Tama&#39;s situation was settled. Zoro also got to say goodbye to Otoko and Hiyori while paying honor to Yasuie and Pedro&#39;s graves. Many of the other Straw Hats also got their small moments to shine, although notably none of them seemed to bid farewell to Kin&#39;emon and Momo.



 One Piece Episode #1085 Will Finally Have the Straw Hats Leave Wano 
          

Wano has been one of One Piece&#39;s best arcs, but also one of its longest. While fans have grown to love Wano&#39;s many new characters, it will be refreshing to see a brand-new island with a new set of problems. It will also be interesting to see how a new island reacts to the Straw Hats now that Luffy is a Yonko. Wano has forever changed the status quo of the series, and while fans have seen brief hints of what that means for the world at large, they haven&#39;t fully seen how it will affect the Straw Hats themselves moving forward.




As One Piece moves on to whatever its next arc ends up being, characters who weren&#39;t able to get a moment to shine in this episode will likely be touched on in episode #1085. This will probably include Kin&#39;emon and Momonosuke, two very important figures in Wano who were largely absent in episode #1084. In One Piece episode #1085, the series can give them the proper sendoff they deserve.
