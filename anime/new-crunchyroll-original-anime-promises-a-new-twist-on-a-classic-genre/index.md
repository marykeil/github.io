## Literature Review

Crunchyroll has announced a new original anime, Astro Note. While its setting may seem familiar, the trailer promises plenty of twists on the formula.




Telecom Animation Film&#39;s Astro Note, which Crunchyroll will stream next year, takes audiences back to the boarding house comedies of the past, albeit with a sci-fi twist. The original anime comes with a bevy of talented creative staff, including the character designer for Carole &amp; Tuesday, and, perhaps appropriately, the director of Gintama. As such, Astro Note seems to be a refreshing comedy set up.




Crunchyroll&#39;s new trailer for the original anime hints at what to expect from Astro Note. Colorful backgrounds and a variety of character designs seem to promise a dynamic show that falls more on the &#34;comedic&#34; side of a romantic-comedy.

With an April 2024 air date, Astro Note seems perfectly poised to welcome both spring and April Fool&#39;s Day.

Crunchyroll&#39;s subtitled trailer comes with a synopsis, giving some context to the upcoming show:


Takumi, a gifted chef, was just let go from his job. He lands a gig at an old boarding house called Astro-sou, but hesitates to accept after learning he must also live there full-time. That is until he meets the beautiful and charming caretaker, Mira, and he’s sold. The two begin to work together and their connection deepens. But Mira has a secret: she isn’t from this world!





The last few seconds of the trailer make it clear that Mira&#39;s secret isn&#39;t hyperbole – Astro Note seems to incorporate extraterrestrials into its already eccentric cast. Aiding in the production are some talented creatives in the anime industry, too. Eisaku Kubonouchi, known best for his designs for Carole &amp; Tuesday, returns to provide another mix of pretty faces and exaggerated bodies befitting the romantic-comedy genre. Meanwhile, Shinji Takamatsu, who directed 105 episodes of Gintama, is acting as chief director – a natural choice, since Astro Note is also about the farcical interactions between humans and aliens. Voice actors Soma Saito and Maaya Uchida will be voicing Takumi and Mira, respectively.

The most curious part of Astro Notes is the return to the boarding house as a location for a romantic comedy. It echoes the likes of Maison Ikkoku or even Love Hina. Even Takumi and Mira&#39;s roles recall the former&#39;s protagonists, Yusaku and Kyoko. However, the &#34;boarding house comedy&#34; had fallen out of favor until now. Astro Note does have a few interesting twists on the formula: besides the sci-fi angle, Takumi works as a live-in cook when most leads are often NEETs. It is a minor change, but it could make Takumi far more invested in the building.





 

The trailer suggests that the &#34;romance&#34; element will be played more for laughs, with Takumi&#39;s attempts to woo a space alien acting more as another joke rather than a serious relationship. Again, this helps distinguish the anime from other similar stories, in which the romance sometimes superseded their attempts at comedy, while it seems to be the opposite here. This original anime will hopefully add variety to next spring, which will doubtlessly be filled with more adaptations or follow-up seasons for already existing franchises. Anime fans should keep an eye on Astro Note next year given its unusual formula twists.
