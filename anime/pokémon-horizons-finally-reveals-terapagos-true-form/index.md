Summary

  Terapagos reveals its true form, showcasing its hidden strength in a powerful attack against Rayquaza.   Terapagos&#39; power is linked to the gathering of the Six Heroes, and may grow stronger as they come together.   After its transformation, Terapagos is temporarily incapacitated, showing that its power comes with a price and is not yet fully reliable.  







A dangerous situation in Pokémon Horizons forced Terapagos to take on its true form momentarily, revealing its power for the first time in the anime. Despite only being able to hold the form for a brief time, Terapagos was able to manage a powerful attack, suggesting there&#39;s far more to this cute little Pokémon than meets the eye.

In the middle of the ocean, the Rising Volt Tacklers were celebrating the addition of Lucius&#39; Lapras to their party when they suddenly spotted the Black Rayquaza. Unfortunately for them, Amethio had been following it and immediately began to fight it with the intention of catching it. Roy was incensed, as he was hoping to prove his newfound strength to Rayquaza, but it quickly became apparent that Rayquaza was still leagues ahead of both Roy and Amethio. After Amethio was defeated, Rayquaza turned its attention toward Roy and the ship, and launched a dangerous attack headed straight for Roy.

          




Liko pushed him out of the way, but Terapagos stepped in and transformed into its Terastal Form, saving Liko&#39;s life.



Pokémon Horizons&#39; English dub will debut in the US on Netflix on February 23, 2024.





 Terapagos&#39; True Form Unleashed a Powerful Attack 
          

Not only did Terapagos tank Rayquaza&#39;s attack, but it was able to launch an attack of its own--its signature move from the games, Tera Starstorm, taking out the many smaller projectiles that came as a result of Rayquaza&#39;s Draco Meteor. However, it only had the strength for one attack, and rapidly returned to its small form. Fortunately, Rayquaza seems to have respected Terapagos&#39; power and decided to leave, no longer interested now that it wasn&#39;t transformed. It&#39;s important to remember that Rayquaza and Terapagos were both allies of Lucius, and have some kind of relationship already, as Terapagos has with the other members of the Six Heroes.




In the episode, Diana (Liko&#39;s grandmother) speculates that Terapagos is regaining its power as a result of gathering the Six Heroes, who have similar energy signatures. Given that Terapagos was dormant in pendant form until very recently, it&#39;s no surprise that it barely had the power to transform, but the implication seems to be that Terapagos will be able to take on its true form more permanently once Lucius&#39;s ancient Pokémon have all been gathered. Rayquaza may even have been testing Terapagos in some way, intending to see how much of its former power it had managed to reclaim.



 Terapagos&#39; Power Comes at a Price 
          

Following its transformation, Terapagos was incapacitated for most of the next day, although it eventually woke up and recovered after eating some berries. Terapagos&#39; power certainly isn&#39;t at a point where it can be relied upon yet, but it clearly is meant to possess an incredible amount of power when transformed, which may be necessary when it comes time to recruit Rayquaza. The anime version of Terapagos seems to have a very different past from its video game counterpart, and it&#39;s unknown what connection, if any, it might have to Paldea&#39;s Area Zero. Pokémon Horizons has set up a Terapagos storyline all its own, and Terapagos&#39; transformation is the first big step towards uncovering the mystery Pokémon&#39;s past.
