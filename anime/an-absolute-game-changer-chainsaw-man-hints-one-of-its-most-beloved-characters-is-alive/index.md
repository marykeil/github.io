## Literature Review

After 150 chapters of the Chainsaw Man manga, Denji is finally reunited with a long-lost friend. One that he thought had been killed long ago.




Warning: Contains Spoilers for Chainsaw Man Chapter 151




The Chainsaw Man manga has confirmed that a beloved character is still alive, 150 chapters after their last appearance. Recent chapters have reintroduced some key characters back into the series, including many of Makima&#39;s hybrid devils last seen at the end of Part 1. However, this returning fan-favorite was thought to have been killed back in chapter one.

In chapter 150, while running back to his apartment with Nayuta to evade the Public Safety Devil Hunters, Denji tells Pochita that he doesn&#39;t need to be Chainsaw Man anymore and that he is &#34;super happy right now&#34;. Pochita replies, confirming that he is still alive within Denji.

          

Despite being the source of Chainsaw Man&#39;s powers, Pochita was thought to have been killed when he became Denji&#39;s heart, something the chainsaw devil did spontaneously to save his friend&#39;s life. However, while their reunion should be a happy one, Pochita immediately references the contract the two formed when doing so.




                  Chainsaw Man&#39;s Returning Enemies Bring Back A Huge Part 1 Mystery   The recent return of the Weapon Hybrids in Chainsaw Man introduce new possibilities to the solution of one of Part 2&#39;s biggest mysteries.   


 Pochita Returns to Put Denji on the Right Path 
          

Pochita reappears specifically when Denji thinks that he&#39;s content with the direction his life is heading in, asking the young devil hunter what he will dream of next. While Denji initially seems convinced that he was happy with his situation, Pochita&#39;s arrival and brief questions are enough to make him think again about whether this is truly the case, whereupon he realizes that being Chainsaw Man is his dream. Since the very first chapter of Chainsaw Man, Denji has shared a contract with the chainsaw devil with an explicit clause for showing him his dreams - the contract having been created in exchange for becoming his heart.




While Pochita&#39;s reappearance may seem somewhat sinister, knowing that what he said was technically a warning against breaking his contract, his words can also be interpreted as guiding Denji into realizing that he is not, in fact, content with how his life is progressing. In chapter 151, Pochita even appears happy that Denji has decided to return to his life as Chainsaw Man, further hinting that this was always intended to be a nudge in the right direction. Despite his departure being one of Chainsaw Man&#39;s saddest deaths, Pochita has shown that he was happy to observe his friend from the sidelines.



 Pochita Responding to Denji is a Turning Point for Chainsaw Man 
          

Since Pochita&#39;s apparent death at the start of the series, Denji has regularly spoken to him about the ongoing pursuit of his dreams and how his life has improved since his days working for the yakuza. Pochita would have been aware of these conversations but refused to respond or influence Denji until it became absolutely necessary. With Denji now back on the correct path as Chainsaw Man, as well as being furious at the Flamethrower Devil for torching his apartment and killing his pet dogs, this appears to be the clear turning point for Denji, and the start of his retaliation against the Chainsaw Man Church and its followers.
