## Literature Review

Typically as a result of experiencing tragic events together, these anime siblings realized that nothing is more important than caring for each other.




Given the medium&#39;s broad range of diverse genres and themes, it should be no surprise that all kinds of relationships are depicted in anime, including some anime siblings that have become so iconic that fans instantly recognize their bond.
In anime, much like in life, a relationship between siblings can take a variety of forms. For instance, some are more distant or indifferent towards each other&#39;s existence, while others stand together and support each other under any circumstances. Whether they faced deadly foes, impossible situations, or any other struggles, these brothers and sisters always had each other&#39;s backs, protecting and encouraging each other to achieve their respective goals.

Produced by Brain&#39;s Base and Based on the Light Novel by Wataru Watari &amp; Ponkan 8
        

My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU follows Hachiman Hikigaya, a cynic and nihilistic high school student who genuinely believes that everyone who claims to experience youthful joy is a self-deceiving liar. However, his attitude and outlook on life slowly begin to change as he is forced to join the Volunteer Service Club, helping other students in need.
Yet, because of his prideful and independent personality, he typically refuses help from others, never relying on anyone, except for his younger sister, Komachi. Because their parents were rarely home, Hachiman and Komachi had to take care of each other and grew to genuinely care and trust each other, although Komachi sometimes teases Hachiman.

Produced by Kyoto Animation and Based on the Manga by Kakifly


 







K-On! follows Yui Hirasawa, a carefree girl who decides to join the Light Music Club on a whim, despite not being able to play any instruments. Yet, under the threat of disbandment, the club is desperate for new members and the other girls are more than willing to have Yui join them, help her learn guitar, and play together.
In fact, as part of the club, Yui even dedicates one of her first written songs to her sister, Ui. The two sisters care for each other deeply, although, ironically enough, it is Ui, the younger sister, who often proves to be more mature and responsible, by taking care of Yui.

The events of the fan-favorite Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood take place in a world where alchemy, despite being common, is bound by strict limitations and rules.

Breaking this law by trying to resurrect their late mother, whose soul is unquantifiable, the brothers lose their bodies, either partially or fully, thereafter embarking on a quest to restore them.
Despite occasionally arguing due to their different personalities, Edward and Alphonse are also extremely protective of each other, and would sacrifice anything to save each other.
