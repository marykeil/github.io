## Literature Review

The Pokémon anime has featured many battles in its more than 20 years of episodes, but some battles emerge as the most exciting and memorable.




The Pokémon anime has featured plenty of exciting battles over its 25-year history, but the best Pokémon battles aren&#39;t just memorable--they represent significant moments for Ash as a character. Ash&#39;s journey to be the best has had some fans invested for a long time, and yet still these battles from years ago are talked about and beloved by the fandom.
Ash&#39;s skill as a trainer has increased considerably since he first began his journey, and that&#39;s because of the battles he&#39;s fought with his strongest Pokémon in the series. With Pikachu at his side, Ash has battled against champions, in regional tournaments, and even competed in the World Coronation Series to become the best trainer in all the land. Out of all his many battles, a few stand out as the best in the anime. These matches showcase the best aspects of the franchise: dazzling animation, non-stop action, and emotionally driven character moments.









 








 15  Ash Vs. Olympia 
XY Episode 93: All Eyes on the Future!
        

Olympia is a Psychic-type gym leader and the seventh that Ash faces in the Kalos region. The battle stands out for being a Double Battle, where both Ash and Olympia used two Pokémon. For Ash, that was Frogadier and Talonflame, while Olympia used two Meowstic. Despite not being in the battle, Pikachu still provides some essential help, counting off the time it takes for Meowstic&#39;s Future Sight to hit, which helps Ash devise a strategy, causing Olympia&#39;s Pokémon to hit themselves with their own attack. Ash&#39;s cleverness in this battle makes it highly entertaining to watch, and Olympia is certainly an opponent who&#39;s not to be underestimated.





 14  Ash Vs. Misty 
Sun &amp; Moon Episode 43: When Regions Collide!
        

Misty, of course, was Ash&#39;s first traveling companion, so it&#39;s already great to see her return to the series. However, her reappearance in Sun &amp; Moon showcases how much the young Water-type trainer has grown. In her reunion match with Ash, Misty shows off that she&#39;s obtained the ability to Mega Evolve her Pokémon, and does so with Gyarados. Ash uses Pikachu, but finds that Misty is a far more challenging opponent than the last time they battled. The match comes to a climactic finish when Ash and Pikachu use a Z-move, giving the battle a flashy end worthy of an old friend&#39;s return.





 13  Ash Vs. Korrina 
Journeys Episode 25: A Festival Reunion!
        

Korrina isn&#39;t Ash&#39;s rival per se, but the show does treat her as such whenever the two cross paths. After their encounters in Kalos, Ash met her again during the World Coronation Series, when the two faced each other in battle to advance to the Great Class. Ash leads with Gengar, but Korrina&#39;s Lucario easily overpowers it. He then sends his powerful Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon, Dragonite, who easily defeats Korrina&#39;s Mienshao. In the end, it comes down to her Mega Lucario against his Dragonite, and the lovable orange dragon claims victory. It&#39;s a tense but entertaining battle that features the return of Mega Evolution and provides the perfect showcase for Ash&#39;s Dragonite.





 12  Ash Vs. Lieutenant Surge 
Original Series Episode 14: Electric Shock Showdown
        

Ash&#39;s journey throughout Kanto was full of highs and lows. The anime did a great job portraying his inexperience in Pokémon battles, which led him to over-rely on Pikachu. Ash learned a valuable lesson when he faced the ruthless Lieutenant Surge, Vermilion City&#39;s Electric-type Gym Leader. Surge&#39;s main Pokémon is Raichu, and the two easily defeat Ash and Pikachu during their first battle. Pikachu again struggles on the re-match, but the yellow mouse remains determined to win. The encounter is action-packed and features an unforgettable moment when Raichu uses his electricity to destroy the Gym&#39;s lights and windows. In the end, Pikachu comes out on top, making every fan cheer alongside the mouse and its Trainer.
            
 
 Why Pikachu Never Evolved in Pokémon 
Pokémon’s Pikachu has not evolved over the franchise’s history in order to push himself as a Pikachu and to remain the face of the franchise.








 11  Ash Vs. Harrison 
Original Series Episode 271: Playing With Fire!
        

Harrison was a recurring character during the Johto season. He was an older and more experienced Trainer from Hoenn who acted as a mentor to Ash. The two shared a friendly rivalry that led to their match at the Silver Conference. The battle is pretty even and features Ash&#39;s Bayleef defeating Harrison&#39;s Houndoom, providing a much-needed moment under the spotlight for the underrated Starter. The match is also significant for being the debut of Blaziken, one of the best Fire Starters in Pokémon. Blaziken lives up to its reputation and defeats Ash&#39;s strongest Pokémon, Charizard, after a grueling fight. It&#39;s a thrilling and unforgettable battle, and even though Ash loses, fans were still proud of him and his team.





 10  Ash Vs. Clemont 
XY Episode 67: The Moment Of Lumiose Truth!
        

Clemont is one of Ash&#39;s most intelligent companions, a sweet and slightly clumsy boy who gets easily embarrassed. He also has some confidence issues, and audiences see him dealing with them throughout the X &amp; Y season. In his role as the Lumiose City Gym Leader, Clemont battles Ash in a three-against-three encounter. The most memorable moment comes when Clemont&#39;s Luxray faces Ash&#39;s Goodra. However, despite a brilliant performance, Luxray isn&#39;t a match for Ash&#39;s Pseudo-Legendary. The battle serves as a breakthrough moment for Clemont, who finally gains some confidence in his abilities. It&#39;s also one of Goodra&#39;s finest moments in the anime, making it even more special.





 9  Ash Vs. Brandon - 
Ruby &amp; Sapphire Episdoe 189 &amp; 190: Gathering the Gang of Four! &amp; Pace - The Final Frontier!
        

Brandon is the head of the Battle Frontier and the final challenge that trainers must overcome in order to be declared victors. The battle is exciting for being one of the few where Ash decides to call upon his old Pokémon for help, bringing up Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charizard off the bench for the first time in ages. Brandon is a formidable opponent, with Legendary Pokémon under his command (in this battle, he uses Regice) and the skill to match. The battle is a rousing last hurrah for Ash&#39;s core Kanto team members, and it&#39;s only become more fun to watch as a blast of nostalgia as the years go by.





 8  Ash Vs. Kukui 
Sun &amp; Moon Episode 144: From Z To Shining Z!
        

Ash&#39;s exhibition match against Professor Kukui during the Alola League is one of the Pokémon&#39;s longest and most rule-breaking battles. It goes on for a whopping five episodes and features Ash and the Professor pulling every trick from their bags to claim victory. Near the end, the Legendary Pokémon Tapu Koko joins Kukui against Ash. The young Trainer brings out his Ultra Beast, Naganadel, and the battle reaches new and epic heights. However, fans&#39; jaws dropped when Naganadel fell, forcing Ash to send his last Pokémon, Pikachu. Seeing the franchise&#39;s mascot take on a Legendary Pokémon is not uncommon, but this time was extra remarkable. Pikachu got to use everything it had learned up to that point, and when it claimed the victory, it felt earned.





 7  Ash Vs. Paul 
Diamond &amp; Pearl Episode 188: Battling A Thaw In Relations!
        

Paul is one of those villains that Pokémon fans love. He also went through a considerable journey of redemption, eventually becoming a more understanding Trainer. Paul is also arguably Ash&#39;s best rival in Pokémon, and their final battle during the Lily of the Valley Conference proves it. Ash and Paul fight using a full team of six. It comes down to Paul&#39;s Electivire and Ash&#39;s Infernape, the latter having evolved from the Chimchar that Paul once mistreated and abandoned. The match ends with Infernape besting Electivire, giving Ash the victory. However, Paul isn&#39;t bitter because he&#39;s come to respect Ash&#39;s skill as a Trainer. It&#39;s the end to a season-long rivalry that ranks as one of Ash&#39;s best. The battle itself is exhilarating, but it&#39;s the history behind the two Trainers that makes it iconic.





 6  Ash Vs. Iris 
Journeys Episode 65: Thrash Of The Titans!
        

Iris is Ash&#39;s former traveling companion. The two shared a contentious relationship during their time in Unova, but there was genuine appreciation behind their actions. The two had massive respect for each other, and fans knew that if they ever met again, the battle would be off the charts. The two friends meet each other when Iris, now Unova&#39;s Champion, challenges Ash for the chance to ascend to the Ultra Class. Ash&#39;s Dracovish bests Iris&#39; Dragonite, but the real showdown is between her Haxorus and his Dragonite. Both dragons give it their all, but Dragonite proves why it is one of Ash&#39;s strongest Pokémon ever and defeats Haxorus with Draco Meteor. The battle perfectly balances nostalgia and excitement, resulting in a riveting encounter that proves how much these two Trainers have grown since they last saw each other.





 5  Ash Vs. Alain 
XY Episode 130: Finals Not for the Faint-Hearted!
        

Alain was a character introduced in the Mega Evolution Specials, who transitioned into the main anime as a rival for Ash. Ash and Alain eventually came to a head-to-head match for the title of Kalos champion, an epic battle featuring full teams of six Pokémon. Their battle is full of exciting and flashy moments, but the match is best known for the battle between Alain&#39;s Mega Charizard X and Ash&#39;s special Bond Phenomenon Greninja. The two incredibly powerful Pokémon clash in a dazzling display, and despite the outcome for Ash, it remains a fan-favorite battle, both from XY specifically and in the anime in general.





 4  Ash Vs. Gladion 
Sun &amp; Moon Episode 139: Enter The Champion!
        

After 22 years and countless battles, Ash finally becomes a Pokémon League Champion. His victory comes after defeating his Alola rival, Gladion, during a tough and now iconic match. Gladion was one of Pokémon Sun and Moon&#39;s best characters, a worthy adversary who pushed Ash to become a better Trainer. Their battle showcases the best of their teams while demonstrating how much respect they have for each other. During the last leg of the encounter, both Trainers send out their respective Lycanroc until only one remains standing. Ash&#39;s victory came at the right moment, and every fan shed a tear he claimed his reward after years of work . It&#39;s a momentous occasion and arguably the single best moment in the anime.





 3  Ash Vs. Tobias 
Diamond &amp; Pearl Episode 189: The Semi-Final Frontier!
        

If there&#39;s one unfair battle in the history of Pokémon, it&#39;s Ash&#39;s match against Tobias during the Lily of the Valley Conference. Throughout his Sinnoh journey, Ash grew exponentially as both a Trainer and a person, and many fans thought he&#39;d finally win the League Championship. Alas, they were wrong. After defeating Paul, Ash went into the Conference&#39;s semifinals against Tobias, a fearsome Trainer whose Darkrai was undefeated up to that point. The battle features several unforgettable moments, including Ash&#39;s Sceptile defeating the seemingly undefeatable Darkrai. However, Tobias remains unbothered and brings out yet another Legendary Pokémon, Latios, granting him the victory. Many fans still debate the validity of this match, considering how overpowered Tobias&#39; team was. However, no one can deny it was a brilliant showdown.





 2  Ash Vs. Leon 
Journeys Episode 129: A Flood of Torrential Gains!
        

Leon is the undefeated champion of the Galar region, and Ash&#39;s final obstacle in the already epic Masters&#39; Eight tournament of the World Coronation Series. The battle is one of the most unique in the anime, with Leon allowing Ash to use Dynamax, Mega Evolution, and Z-moves all in the same battle (when normally he&#39;d only be able to use one of the three). Leon proves he&#39;s been getting ready by using some of Ash&#39;s most radical battle strategies against him, while Ash puts his most powerful team to the test to take down Leon&#39;s undefeated Charizard. Everything in the series&#39; history has been building to this moment, and it&#39;s absolutely as epic as it deserved to be.





 1  Ash Vs. Gary 
Original Series Episode 270: Can&#39;t Beat the Heat!
        

Ash&#39;s rivalry with Gary was evident from the very first episode. Gary loved mocking Ash, going out of his way to humiliate him whenever possible. Their dynamic evolved over time until they became respectful of each other&#39;s abilities. When Ash and Gary finally faced each other in battle during the Silver Conference, fans held their breaths as these two Trainers gave it their all. It came down to Gary&#39;s Blastoise versus Ash&#39;s Charizard, and in one of the anime&#39;s most iconic moments, Charizard carries Blastoise while doing a Seismic Toss, dropping the turtle and earning Ash the win. While many other battles might be more exciting, none is more meaningful.
When it comes to Pokémon battles, flashy animation and cool moves are important, but what matters most is the significance that the battles have to the characters who take part. In the series&#39; best battles, not only are there awesome creatures going head-to-head at full strength, but also an emotional importance for Ash. Whether it&#39;s showing a rival how much he&#39;s grown, competing to achieve his dream, or a gym battle against a friend, all of Pokémon&#39;s best battles have had a big impact on Ash as a character.
