## Literature Review

Swordsmen are some of the strongest characters in anime. Though, which ones are the most legendary and iconic?




Swordplay is a huge part of fantasy, which is why the most legendary swordsmen in anime and manga are such iconic characters. Given Japan&#39;s history with samurai, it&#39;s no wonder that so many anime characters wield swords.
Just because a character has or uses a sword doesn&#39;t make them legendary though. To rank among the most legendary swordsmen in anime and manga history, a character has to basically make their sword-fighting superhuman. The best anime and manga sword fighters are dangerous warriors who can bring the strongest opponents down with nothing but their blade and their wits.

 Artoria Pendragon (Saber) — Fate/Stay Night 
Created By Type Moon
        

Artoria Pendragon, better known as Saber, is King Arthur but as a woman. Saber is one of the strongest classes in the Holy War and is a constant recurring character in the Fate franchise. Saber is an interesting character who often comes off as a chivalrous and righteous character, though as more story is revealed the viewers learn she was a terrible and neglectful ruler.
However, Saber&#39;s skill with a blade is second to none and the duels she has given are some of the best in anime. She has been seen combating all sorts of famous historical figures and even managed to best Sasaki Kojiro, known to be one of the greatest samurai of all time who only lost to Miyamoto Musashi in life.

 Yoriichi Tsugikuni — Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer 
Created By Koyoharu Gotouge
        

Yoriichi Tsugikuni is a background character with a terrifying skill that doesn&#39;t ever seem to get surpassed in the Demon Slayer series. Yoriichi is known as the greatest of demon slayers and is the only man who came close to killing Muzan. He is also the brother of Kokushibo, who went down the route of a demon, rather than a human-like Yoriichi. Yoriichi&#39;s story is one of the most beautiful of Demon Slayer and his representation as both a human and a swordsman is more than worth remembering.

 Sakata Gintoki — Gintama 
Created By Hideaki Sorachi
        

Gintoki may not usually take things seriously, but when he does, he&#39;s the most dangerous swordsman around. His duels in Gintama are incredible and many fans consider his fight against Takasugi to be the best sword fight in anime, as well as one of the greatest fights in anime. Gintoki has lived by the blade his whole life and is usually seen with a bamboo sword in the series due to owning a sword being outlawed in Japan. Regardless, Gintoki proves himself as the most able swordsman around and is one of the most memorable protagonists in anime.

 Roronoa Zoro — One Piece 
Created By Eiichiro Oda


 







While Zoro may not be as good as a swordsman as Mihawk yet, he&#39;s still one of the most exceptional sword fighters in the series and has easily become one of the most iconic swordsmen in anime and manga. Zoro&#39;s transformation as a swordsman has been incredible to witness and is one of the best aspects of One Piece. Zoro&#39;s best fights in One Piece are some of the greatest in the series and fans always enjoy seeing him surpass his limits and evolve further as a swordsman. Whether it was learning how to cut and not cut anything he wanted in his fight against Mr. One or mastering Conqueror&#39;s Haki in his battle against King, his duels are always entertaining.

 Guts — Berserk 
Created By Kentaro Miura


 







Guts is the main protagonist of Berserk, one of the best seinen manga ever. He is commonly referred to as the Black Swordsman and wields a massive sword weighing nearly 400 pounds. Despite the ridiculous girth and heft of the blade, he can swing it easily and with precise skill. It does have its weaknesses, but it has been an asset to him more often than not.
Due to Guts&#39;s absurd strength and bloody battles, some fans often see him as nothing more than just an overpowered swordsman with no real skill. However, there is a clear emphasis on swordsmanship skill in Berserk and Guts has no doubt earned his right to be considered one of the most legendary anime and manga swordsmen.

 Mugen &amp; Jin — Samurai Champloo 
Created By Shinichiro Watanabe &amp; Studio Manglobe
        

As much as it would pain either character to hear it, both Mugen and Jin from Samurai Champloo are too evenly matched to declare one better or more legendary than the other. Mugen&#39;s reckless fighting style makes him an unpredictable opponent, especially against trained opponents. Additionally, his win-at-any-cost mentality means he isn&#39;t afraid to incorporate the environment into his fighting style if it will benefit him.
On the exact opposite end of the spectrum is Jin. Jin&#39;s measured and disciplined sword style makes him a far more cerebral fighter. While Mugen&#39;s fights are all out street brawls, Jin&#39;s are elaborate chess matches that require precision and thought. It&#39;s this training that lets Jin punch above his weight and hold his own against the handful of fighters left in Samurai Champloo&#39;s world who legitimately do outclass him.

 Dracule Mihawk — One Piece 
Created By Eiichiro Oda
        

Dracule Mihawk has long been hailed as the strongest swordsman in One Piece and will hold that title for a few more years still. His strength is astonishing, reaching the heights of even one of the Four Emperors. While fans haven&#39;t had the opportunity to see him put his swordsmanship to the test too often, every time he does, he impresses. His final duel with Roronoa Zoro is by far one of the most anticipated fights in One Piece and then everyone will finally get to see him show his full strength.

 Miyamoto Musashi — Vagabond 
Created By Takehiko Inoue
        

The story of Miyamoto Musashi in Vagabond is based on the novel Musashi which recounts the story of the man regarded as the greatest samurai to ever live. Vagabond is a faster-paced story but manages to capture the development and philosophy of Musashi well while also giving some of the most breathtaking artwork in the manga.
Musashi is easily the most legendary swordsman in anime and manga as he gives the reader everything a fan could want in a swordsman. He has epic duels that put him against the odds, but he also develops as a person and a swordsman by becoming in tune with nature and religion. Musashi&#39;s depth is incredible, and every reader will leave changed after reading this incredible story. It&#39;s fighting that one of the best swordsmen in history is also the most legendary swordsmen in anime and manga history.
