  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Tragic manga characters suffer so many dreadful circumstances and sorrows that no amount of luck will save them from despair.
Backstories of manga characters are often dismal and agonizing, serving as the source of their strength and growth in the story.
Some characters, like Mikey in
Tokyo Revengers
and Homura in
Puella Magi Madoka Magica
, endure exceptional pain and tragedy that deeply impact their personalities and actions.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While grief is a common element of a manga story, the suffering endured by some characters is so intense that it deserves a special classification.</p>
<p>While a good manga character should never completely avoid the bitterness of tragedy, the most tragic manga characters suffer so many dreadful circumstances and sorrows that no amount of luck will save them from the depths of despair.
Few, if any, manga characters escape a bout of tragedy in their backstory. Indeed, the harshness that they suffered in their personal history is normally the source of what makes them the strong individuals they are destined to become in the story. But sometimes, that backstory is so dismal and agonizing that its emotional impact is palpable, going above and beyond what is necessary to facilitate a character’s growth.</p>
<p>10  Manjiro &ldquo;Mikey&rdquo; Sano - The Pain Of Lost Loved Ones Takes Its Toll
Tokyo Revengers | Kodansha |</p>
<p>Ken Wakui’s Tokyo Revengers follows the exploits of Takemichi Hanagaki, who is granted the ability to travel back in time. He uses his power in an attempt to reverse the death of Hinata - his childhood sweetheart who is killed in a violent youth gang incident. Takemichi’s plan is to steer Mikey - the leader of the gang involved in Hinata’s death - in a different direction that, hopefully, will change the future.
As the gang leader, Mikey holds a coveted position in the youth gang world. However, his position belies the pain that he quietly suffers, including dealing with the death of his brother, the former gang leader. Indeed, everyone Mikey is close to seems to suffer a horrible fate – that is often connected to Mikey’s own actions. This slowly turns the formerly happy-go-lucky Mikey into one of the story&rsquo;s darkest and most sadistic characters.

<p>9  Rintaro Okaba - Watching Helplessly As Those He Cares About Die
Steins;Gate | Media Factory |</p>
<p>Nitroplus and Sarachi Yomi’s Steins;Gate follows the story of Rintaro Okaba as he and his tech lab colleagues attempt to thwart the start of World War III. They stumble upon this information after they discover the device they&rsquo;ve been working on can send messages back in time. If saving the world wasn’t a heavy enough burden for Okaba there’s also the heartbreaking pain of seeing the two people he most cares about in the world, his childhood friend Mayuri Shiina and his love interest Kurisu Makise die as a result of their efforts to stop the war.
Even more soul-crushing is the fact that due to the numerous time jumps Okaba has to make to reset the future, he has to endure seeing Mayuri and Kurisu’s deaths tens of times with each time as painful as the first.

<p>8  Homura Akemi - My Friend Is Dead And It&rsquo;s All My Fault
Puella Magi Madoka Magica | Houbunsha |</p>
<p>While Puella Magi Madoka Magica originally sets out to distinguish itself from other magical girl stories by assuming a darker tone, no one expected it would dive so deeply into the gloom. No character is more indicative of this choice than Akemi Homura. As the first magical girl to enter the storyline, readers assume she will be a good mentor for Madoka. However, as later revealed, it was Madoka who originally saved her from harm, and died for her effort.
Consequently, Akemi becomes a magical girl to stop Madoka from becoming one in the hope that doing so will save her from her fate. Unfortunately, Akemi’s plans go awry, and she is forced to watch Madoka die or become a witch countless times. The tragedy here is that, prior to becoming a magical girl, Akemi was already depressed. That feeling only became stronger after becoming a magical girl and failing in her goal to save Madoka.

<p>7  Shinji Ikari - Strained Father And Son Relationship Bears Poisonous Fruit
Neon Genesis Evangelion | Kadokawa Shoten |</p>
<p>As the adaptation/spin-off of the legendary anime series, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto’s Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the first manga to address - in creative detail - the mental effects of piloting the mechas that populated some of the most popular manga stories. As such, the series’ protagonist, Shinji Ikari, offers a perfect specimen for understanding the life of a chronic sufferer. It starts with his mother’s death due to an experimental mecha technology that his father was helping to develop.
Shinji’s father then forces him to become a mecha pilot, but treats him like any other member of the team. The combination of intense training and his father’s cold attitude led Shinji to suffer acute depression that only got worse when he was deployed to the frontlines of the war against the Angels. Indeed, the stress of war, as well as dealing with normal adolescent issues like his romantic interest in a colleague who looks surprisingly like his mother, lead to a world of suffering that never really ends for Shinji.

<p>6  Itachi Uchiha - Family Dysfunction And Social Pressure
Naruto | Shueisha |</p>
<p>In Masashi Kishimoto&rsquo;s Naruto, Itachi Uchiha’s demons appeared early on in his life. Heir to his clan’s leadership, Itachi was exposed to the horrors of war from a very early age. Rather than shape and mold the mental toughness a future clan leader needs, it permanently turned the young Uchiha off to war as a means to achieve society’s goals. His grief was deepened further when he learned of his clan’s deep-seated mistrust and hatred of the Konoha community, and their plans to take control of the leadership.
Despite his familial ties, he nevertheless informed the authorities of their plans and was, to his shock, forced to kill them all but for his younger brother, Sasuke – who was forced to hate him. Indeed, to say Itachi suffered belies the true extent of the tragic circumstances he endured for most of his life.

<p>5  Vegeta - A Narcissist Dealing With A Chronic Failure To Achieve
Dragon Ball | Shueisha |</p>
<p>Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball depicts Son Goku’s quest to become stronger by challenging himself through constant battles. Vegeta is one of the many individuals Goku meets on his quest. Like Goku, Vegeta is also a Saiyan – in fact, he is a member of the Saiyan royal family – and that is where his suffering begins. First, Frieza forced him to be his servant after he conquered the Saiyan home world. Later, Vegeta admits that Frieza tortured him mentally by forcing him to fight and plunder the universe in his name. To ensure Vegeta’s compliance, Frieza threatened to destroy Vegeta’s family if he failed.
These details were exclusive to the Dragon Ball Z anime, but they still add much-needed depth to Vegeta&rsquo;s backstory and his relationship with Frieza.</p>
<p>While Vegeta ultimately had a happy ending, this does not change the fact that he witnessed his family and entire race die at the hands of an unbeatable (at the time) monster who forced him into servitude. Vegeta then grew into an evil villain, but it was due to circumstances rather than attitude, as he later proved. Even Vegeta&rsquo;s ultimate redemption means that he has to bear the weight of his past actions, something that he still struggles with.

If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the one woman he falls head-over-heels in love with, Makima, feigns interest in him only because he’s connected with Pochita. Makima&rsquo;s ruthless manipulation of Denji is truly painful to watch, and she also uses his feelings for her to assassinate his best friend right in front of his eyes. Despite all his suffering, Denji however never loses his unique, simple, and bizarre outlook on life.

<p>3  Eren Yeager - The Inevitable Fall Into Darkness
Attack on Titan | Kodansha |</p>
<p>In Hajime Isayama&rsquo;s Attack on Titan, young Eren Yeager&rsquo;s life came toppling down the day the Titans attacked Wall Maria and ate Eren&rsquo;s mother. While seeing one’s parent murdered in front of your eyes is enough to transform anyone into a tragic figure, Eren’s suffering was further compounded by the fact that, as later revealed, it was his future self as the Founding Titan who ordered Dina Fritz to attack his own mother.
He needed to do this to cause the triggering event that would eventually push Eren to become the Founding Titan. Indeed, it was that fateful decision that resulted in nearly all the tragedy that Eren would suffer over the course of the story. Like a true tragic hero, his pain was self-inflicted.

<p>2  Ken Kaneki - The Psychological Impacts Of Isolation And Torture
Tokyo Ghoul | Shueisha |</p>
<p>Sui Ishida’s Tokyo Ghoul is set in the secret world of ghouls – supernatural creatures that look like humans but must eat human flesh to survive. Unfortunately for mild-mannered Ken Kaneki, he developed a crush on fellow bookworm Rize Kamishiro, who also happened to be one of the most ferocious ghouls in Tokyo. After luring him out on a date, Rize attempted to eat him but was injured in the process. Death would have been a better ending for Ken. Instead, parts of Rize were transplanted into Ken turning him into a half-human, half-ghoul hybrid.
Uneasy with the desires and ideas of his ghoul half, Ken suffered quietly in isolation. This changed for a time after connecting with other ghouls who frequented a local café he worked at. Whatever peace he found there, however, was permanently demolished after meeting the sadistic ghoul Yamori who tortured Ken mercilessly. It was an experience that changed Ken forever and made him embrace his dark ghoul side.

<p>1  Guts - A Life Spent Between Tragedy And Revenge
Berserk | Hakusensha|</p>
<p>In Kentarou Miura’s Berserk, Guts life started tragically, and he arguably never truly escaped the shadows of his birth. Indeed, born from his recently deceased mother’s corpse, only to be cared for by another woman who died a few years later, Guts was then abused by that woman’s husband. For a time, Guts was able to repress the suffering of his youth through the blood and sweat of battle. For a moment, his suffering was nearly conquered as he found friendship, camaraderie, and even love through his relationships with Griffith and Casca.
But that was rent asunder after Griffith sacrificed Casca, the Bank of the Hawk, and Guts to become a member of the demonic God Hand. After watching his friends die and the woman he loved being abused in front of his eyes, Guts survived only to set off on a lonely path of revenge, hoping to bring Caska back to sanity while defending her every night from the demonic apostles hunting them. Even after he finally found peace on Elf Island, Guts&rsquo; life was shattered again by Griffith in the most recent chapters of the manga.

Tragedy and grief are a key component of manga stories. They add the dynamic tension that is a necessary element of any good story and the fuel for character growth. However, there are some characters whose suffering goes above and beyond what is normally encountered, earning them an unenviable spot among the most tragic manga characters.</p>
