## Literature Review

Trigger&#39;s anime have a reputation for excellence at minimum, and over a decade of operation, has built up a selection of shows worthy of viewing.




Since 2013, Studio Trigger has carved a name for itself by creating high-energy anime, often depicting wild stories that allow the staff to push their imagination to the limits. While their output isn&#39;t as prolific as other big-name anime production companies, it only makes their existing work more noteworthy.
With producing the highly-anticipated Delicious in Dungeon next year, the studio has entered discussion yet again. While it has a reputation for animating wacky shows for wackiness&#39; sake, the inventiveness of the studio cannot be denied, even if it doesn&#39;t always strike true.









 








 10  Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 
2022, Directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (10 episodes)


 







Enough ink has been spilled on their 2022 magnum opus, which proved that CD Projekt Red&#39;s vision of Night City was more than just a buggy mess, and that Trigger could do more than the assumed &#34;wild and wacky&#34;, even if the animation still had its telltale over-exaggeration. Cyberpunk&#39;s success was a sorely-needed shot in the arm for Trigger that repaired its reputation, after its last few works were considered acceptable but not particularly noteworthy. While its 10 episodes mean the plot moves at a rapidfire pace, the anime still manages to reach a satisfyingly tragic end in its short runtime.

 9  Darling in the Franxx 
2018, Directed by Atsushi Nishigori (24 episodes)


 







This collaborative effort with A-1 Pictures and Cloverworks depicts a post-apocalyptic world, where teenage duos pilot mechs known as &#34;Franxx&#34; in combat. All the while, protagonist Hiro comes to grips with his problematic relationship with the enigmatic girl Zero Two. Trigger provides clean, understated art to this examination of human identity and types of love. Its first 13 episodes manage to stay focused and atmospheric, but sadly, the anime bungles its second half, as Trigger&#39;s tendency for epic finales works against it here with wild twists. Nonetheless, Franxx still provides a sympathetic cast that carries its plot to a proper ending.

 8  Star Wars: Visions 
2021, The Twins directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, The Elder directed by Masahiko Otsuka (2 episodes)


 







Trigger was commissioned by Disney to produce two shorts for the first season of this anthology series, resulting in The Twins and The Elders. Both showcase the dichotomy of the studio in when it chooses to lean into its reputation and what it can do otherwise. The Twins verges on self-parody as its Luke Skywalker pastiche duels while atop a speeding X-Wing, while The Elder has one of the more creative fights and stories set in the Star Wars universe. Both stories show Trigger&#39;s talents, perfect for those short on time or just eager to watch everything the studio has.

 7  BNA: Brand New Animal 
2020, Directed by Yoh Yoshinari (12 episodes)


 







This anime follows Michiru, who somehow transforms into a &#34;beastman&#34;, forcing her to travel to Anima City and live alongside its anthropomorphic citizens. Short and sweet, this is one of Trigger&#39;s more tame adventures. While its goofy energy makes it fun to watch, and its comedy consistently lands, it lacks the charisma Trigger&#39;s other anime have that makes them so timelessly memorable. By this point, Trigger&#39;s wackiness was becoming a little too familiar. Nonetheless, BNA is a short and sweet adventure that more than proves that the studio will always have its sense of humor and playfulness.

 6  Promare 
2019, Directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (115 minutes)


 







Just to prove how absurd Trigger can make anything, the studio chose to add their usual madcap touch to the concept of fire fighting, with members of Burning Rescue combating the Burnish – humans with pyrokinetic powers – with water-and-ice wielding mechhs. Thanks to its movie budget, Promare is able to achieve some truly outrageous and inventive visuals, with Trigger making some clever use of computer graphics to give all the fiery visuals various neon hues. LGBTQ&#43; audiences also have a treat, with Lio and Galo&#39;s heated rivalry-turned-partnership having enough romantic subtext to not see it as an intentional move by Trigger.

 5  Kiznaiver 
2016, Directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi (12 episodes)


 







Kiznaiver is a tragically underrated original anime produced by Studio Trigger that explores empathy, and the complex connections we make with the people around us. The story of a group of students selected to become &#34;Kiznaivers&#34; who can share each other&#39;s pain, often feels hampered in execution by the many characters&#39; interactions that seem skewed more towards romantic troubles than anything else.
Despite that, Trigger&#39;s artwork is running on all cylinders here, with character details, background movement and even the eyes showcasing the effort the studio puts into all its work. On a more somber note, Kiznaiver is also notable in that its opening song is also the last work by the Japanese electronic duo Boom Boom Satellites.

 4  SSSS.Gridman 
2018, Directed by Akira Amemiya (12 episodes)


 







Trigger turned heads when it announced it was launching a remake of the highly obscure tokusatsu series Gridman the Hyper Agent. Despite seeming like a long shot, the series ended up being a hit, albeit being a slow-burn story, with its first half having an intentionally generic &#34;monster-of-the-week&#34; setup. As the plot develops and twists begin to unravel, Gridman turns out to be a surprisingly heartfelt story that focuses itself on the secrets behind its central villain. Trigger&#39;s optimism and theatricality lend themselves well here, as the studio is able to essentially resuscitate a dormant IP back into fighting shape.

 3  SSSS.Dynazenon 
2021, Directed by Akira Amemiya (12 episodes)


 







The sequel to SSSS.Gridman is a worthy follow-up, though not nearly as well-implemented. While the mix of character drama and monster-battling still holds true, the choice to expand the scope of it over a larger cast, all of whom have their own kinds of baggage, stretches the plot a little thing, not helped by a group of villains who aren&#39;t nearly as memorable as in Gridman&#39;s. Nonetheless, the two shows complement each other well and even lead into the Gridman Universe movie that ties the setting together. Dynazenon is for fans who want plenty of old-fashioned transforming robot action, à la GaoGaiGar.

 2  Little Witch Academia 
2017, Directed by Yoh Yoshinari (25 episodes), 2013 (30 minute OVA), 2015, The Enchanted Parade (55 minute OVA)


 







Trigger&#39;s answer to Harry Potter has had many renditions, though they all owe some credit to the 2013 short animation. All of them follow Atsuko&#39;s life in a magic school as she learns the ropes of being a witch with her friends. The original anime is a slick piece of animation filled with whimsy and comedy, while the TV series uses its lengthy runtime to create an ongoing mystery. Audiences will have to decide which version of Luna Nova Academy suits them, but it remains one of the more unique versions of a magic school to come out of Japan.

 1  Kill la Kill 
2013, Directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (24 episodes)


 







As Trigger&#39;s very first anime as an independent studio, Kill la Kill is synonymous with their predilection for excess. Ryuko and Satsuki&#39;s rivalry amid a hyper-stylized, militarized school dystopia offers laughs and elaborate fight scenes at any given time. While audiences might be split on whether its nudity/clothing motif is carefully considered or just a way to excuse its raunchy humor, all of that, along with its insane storyline makes Kill la Kill is one of the most unique anime series in recent history. It is probably the perfect litmus test as to how much Trigger a viewer can take.
