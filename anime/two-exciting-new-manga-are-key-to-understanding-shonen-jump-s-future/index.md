## Literature Review

Two new Shonen Jump manga hint at an exciting new direction that some of the magazine&#39;s future sports and action series may explore further.





Do Retry and Martial Master Asumi are both series focusing on a real-world fighting sport. The former by Jun Kirarazaka follows a young boxer Aozora in the aftermath of World War II, and the latter by Kawada focuses on a reluctant MMA fighter Asumi in the present day. While boxing and MMA are quite different from each other, both series focusing on them in such a short time implies that Shonen Jump is likely looking for a new series covering this sort of real-world fighting. This serves as a refreshing contrast to more fantastical battle series like Jujutsu Kaisen as well as potentially appealing to fans of sports manga, who have had little to read since Haikyu!! ended.





 Shonen Jump Is Featuring More Fighting Sports Manga 
          

Of course, Shonen Jump has recently featured the sports manga Blue Box for these fans to enjoy as well. However, that series is more focused on romance than the actual sports its main characters play. Some of the magazine&#39;s manga focused on performance art like Akane-banashi can be thought of as a form of sports series, as the characters compete in a real-life discipline. However, while Akane-banashi is a superb series that has revolutionized many classic Shonen Jump tropes, it lacks the physical action that a classic sports manga provides. That is where sports manga about real-life fighting can fill a niche in the magazine.

Since these manga are both about sports and fighting, they can appeal to both sports manga fans and battle manga fans, making it easy for new readers to get invested. Do Retry even tried to combine grounded real-world boxing techniques with wild Shonen powers to make its action more entertaining for fans of the magazine&#39;s fantastical fights. Martial Master Asumi on the other hand shows that more realistic MMA fighting can be compelling even without any additional gimmicks. Newer series focused on this genre may choose to balance their combat system anywhere in between these two approaches, making the possibilities for future stories endless.






 Shonen Jump&#39;s New Sports Series Are Exciting News For Action Fans 
          

Of course, there have been popular real-world fighting manga in the past like the iconic Hajime no Ippo or Ashita no Joe, but neither of these series were serialized in Shonen Jump. The fact that the magazine is now starting to publish multiple new series in this vein is a sign that it might want to replicate those mangas&#39; success in the modern day. If this is true, then it heralds an exciting new direction for Shonen Jump&#39;s sports manga series that is sure to please both sports fans and action fans alike.

Do Retry and Martial Master Asumi are both available to read from Viz Media.
