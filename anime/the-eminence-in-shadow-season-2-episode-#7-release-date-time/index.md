## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #7 will feature Shadow Garden reckoning with Cid&#39;s apparent betrayal and also show more of Gettan.




Episode #7 of The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 has huge anticipation surrounding it after episode #6 has completely upended the anime&#39;s status quo. This sort of major change to the show&#39;s structure is only possible with The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s great hero Cid, who is chaotic enough to make it happen. This makes episode #7 and the rest of the arc even more unpredictable, likely with many twists and surprises in store.

 What Happened in The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #6? 
          




Episode #6 largely focused on Shadow Garden&#39;s reaction to the defeat of its members at the hands of John Smith as shown in the previous episode. Alpha decided to send Delta to defeat this new threat, but during their battle, Delta realized that John Smith was actually Shadow and stopped fighting him. To maintain his cover, Cid sent Delta on a mission far away but this caused the rest of Shadow Garden to believe that Delta was dead. Alpha thus took it upon herself to get revenge for Delta, but in her battle with John Smith, she also realized he was Shadow. This led to an emotional fight with Alpha begging to know why Shadow was doing this, culminating in her defeat and no satisfactory answers.



The episode also explored Yukime&#39;s backstory.






 In The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #7 Shadow Garden Will Deal With Cid&#39;s Betrayal 
          




After her defeat, it is unclear if Alpha will continue to marshal the forces of Shadow Garden against John Smith. After all, his true identity is the leader of Shadow Garden, which would seem to make their conflict somewhat pointless. However, Cid didn&#39;t give Alpha a good reason why he was doing what he is doing and since it appears to Shadow Garden that he killed Delta they might decide that he has completely forsaken the organization and treat him as a major threat. If so then episode #7 may feature a battle between John Smith and multiple members of the Seven Shades.

While the conflict between Cid and Shadow Garden is the most interesting part of this arc, episode #7 could also focus more deeply on the arc&#39;s main antagonist Gettan. He has been slowly built up as a major threat even though he has not directly confronted John Smith yet. Given the escalating economic crisis though he may finally take the time to act now. All of these different exciting plot threads mean that The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #7 will surely be an awesome new installment that will continue to cement the anime&#39;s status as one of the best isekai.
