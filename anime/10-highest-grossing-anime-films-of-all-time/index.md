Created By MAPPA &amp; Based on the Manga By Gege Akutami
        

This prequel film to the hit Jujutsu Kaisen series takes up the next spot with a tremendous $196.3 million worldwide gross. What&#39;s amazing though is that this film wouldn&#39;t have ended up on this list had they gone through with their original plan to make it a series. Instead, the decision to make Jujutsu Kaisen 0 into a film had fans turning out in droves to see on the big screen the ever-expanding world of sorcerers and Cursed Spirits that made the manga and its anime adaptation so popular.

It&#39;s a sweet little story that clearly touched the hearts of millions seeing as it&#39;s still cherished to this day with yearly re-releases as part of Ghibli Fest.

Created By Studio Ghibli &amp; Based on the Novel By Diana Wynne Jones


 







Keeping the Ghibli train moving is Miyazaki&#39;s 2004 film Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. This abstract tale of a woman cursed by a witch that moves in with a local wizard has been heralded as one of the most beloved fantasy films of all time. Howl&#39;s Moving Castle even got nominated by the Oscars for Best Animated Feature, only to lose to Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Still, it has rightfully earned its place in history with fans showing up to see it in theaters to give it its impressive $237.5 million gross. The characters and story are rich, and the movie&#39;s layered story makes it a pleasure to watch multiple times.

 6  One Piece Film: Red - $246.6 million 
Created By Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Eiichiro Oda


 







Perhaps the most talked about film of 2022 among anime fans, One Piece Film: Red absolutely dominated the global box office with a whopping $246.6 million. This musical action-adventure pulled in some impressive numbers in the US as it pushed the One Piece story forward while also being a refreshing entry that stayed true to the series spirit. It easily outdid every other film in the franchise while also breaking records for other anime films that came before it. While it never broke the biggest box office gross, it was still an impressive feat for Luffy and his pirate crew with their latest big-screen adventure.

 5  The First Slam Dunk - $258.6 million 
Created By Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Takehiko Inoue
        

The First Slam Dunk may be the most shocking highest-grossing anime to Western fans. The movie is a sports anime film based on a 90s manga created by Takehiko Inoue, who also directs the movie. This sports story has received numerous accolades around the world, even earning Best Animation of the Year at Japan&#39;s Academy Award ceremony. It currently sits at $258.6 million worldwide, but this number will likely continue to grow as it hasn&#39;t been released in the US or Canada yet. Should word of mouth continue to spread, it could continue to rise up and become one of the biggest anime films of all time.





 4  Suzume - $322.5 million 
Created By Makoto Shinkai &amp; CoMix Wave Films


 







Director Makoto Shinkai returns to the list with his latest film, Suzume, absolutely dominating the box office. This tale follows a young girl who happens upon a mysterious boy whose job is to close supernatural doors that open all over Japan, unleashing natural disasters. It&#39;s a love letter to the land of Japan and to its beautiful, but sometimes cruel, nature. Suzume&#39;s current $322.5 million box office gross has been well-deserved, having received considerable praise from critics and audiences with a spectacular theatrical run that made it blow past One Piece Film: Red.
Suzume will be available on Crunchyroll on November 18th!





 3  Your Name - $382.2 million 
Created By Makoto Shinkai &amp; CoMix Wave Films


 







Your Name making it onto this list solidifies Makoto Shinkai as the next big Japanese director following Hayao Miyazaki. His films have found ways to reach multiple audiences worldwide with his tight themes and gorgeous filmmaking. Your Name is arguably his best film though, grossing $382.2 million globally. This sci-fi body swap story was so well-received that it has become an all-time classic and a highly recommended anime film for anyone wanting to get started on the medium. Its character work, writing, and phenomenal ending make it one of the best stories out there.

 2  Spirited Away - $395.6 million 
Created By Hayao Miyazaki &amp; Studio Ghibli


 







Unsurprisingly, the film that&#39;s praised as Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s masterpiece, Spirited Away, has been one of the highest-grossing anime films of all time since its debut in 2003. This fantasy story has been praised for its visuals and heartwarming script that thrusts the viewer into a bizarre spirit realm that&#39;s beautifully explored through its characters. However, the film&#39;s global box office of $395.6 million owes a lot to its big win at the Academy Awards when Miyazaki took home the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. This put the film on the map and made it a must-watch for film fans as it continued its theatrical run. It continues to make money to this day as well as a highlight of the annual Ghibli Fest with this year also seeing a theatrical screening of Spirited Away: Live on Stage to accompany it.

 1  Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train - $507.1 million 
Created By Ufotable &amp; Based on the Manga Created By Koyoharu Gotouge
        

After 17 years of being at the top, Spirited Away was finally dethroned as the highest-grossing anime film of all time by the first Demon Slayer film, which was released in October 2020. This sequel film to the hit anime series brought together fans worldwide for an event that was even more significant considering that COVID-19 shut down a lot of theaters that year. Mugen Train sailed past numerous films that were released before quarantine including Bad Boys for Life and Sonic the Hedgehog​​​​​​, while also beating out Christopher Nolan&#39;s Tenet. It&#39;s an incredible feat that has yet to be topped, and it will likely be a long time before any anime film beats it.
Looking at this list, it&#39;s surprising to see that popular franchises such as Pokémon or Dragon Ball never cracked the Top 10 given how immensely popular they were when their respective films released. However, that says a lot about the current state of anime. The medium has grown in popularity over the decades to the point where they can be solid box office contenders. It&#39;s impressive to see just how far anime has come when it&#39;s a top contender for being one of the highest-grossing mediums in the entertainment world. The highest-grossing anime films are all amazing examples of the medium&#39;s potential!
