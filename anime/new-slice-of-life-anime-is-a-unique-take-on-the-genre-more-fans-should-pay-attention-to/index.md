## Literature Review

Doga Kobo&#39;s upcoming Jellyfish Can&#39;t Swim in the Night looks to be a gorgeous original work that brings the city to life at night with its visuals.




Jellyfish Can&#39;t Swim in the Night, a new anime series scheduled for an April release during the Spring 2024 anime season, is shaping up to be an atypical slice-of-life show. Its characters, their unique backgrounds, and its focus on the Shibuya district of Tokyo provides a different aesthetic than what most anime fans are used to. While cities are a common setting, most anime don&#39;t make them visually pleasing, but Jellyfish might be one of the few that will join that small group.




The first official trailer for the original anime gives more insight into the mood and feel of the show than the actual plot. However, the excellent visuals show an interest in making the urban setting brim with life. One shouldn&#39;t brush off the female cast as inevitably leading to more &#34;cute girls doing cute things&#34; either, as there appears to be so much more just below the surface.

                  One Classic Slice of Life Anime Proves How Localization Can Improve Series   Squid Girl&#39;s English script is a great example of remaining true to the original while letting the humor shine in a different language.   


 


 Highlighting The Challenges Of Creativity With A Colorful Cast

The official trailer for Jellyfish Can&#39;t Swim in the Night, which can be found on YouTube, provides plenty of sumptuous visuals of Shibuya, aglow with lights, emphasized with shadows, and dolled up with elaborate graffiti. The anime isn&#39;t just an original production by Doga Kobo; it also marks the 50-year anniversary of the long-running studio, which has worked on a variety of projects, ranging from Galaxy Express 999 to Paprika, not even mentioning its standalone works, like Shikimori&#39;s Not Just a Cutie. Those decades of experience pay off, with the nightlife becoming an exciting source of art, rather than just narrative window dressing.

The website for the anime is still light on details regarding the plot, but its synopsis pays attention to the jobs of its cast: an illustrator, a former idol, a V-tuber, and a composer who seem to be working together to create an &#34;anonymous artist&#34;. The idea of creativity and inspiration seems to be the core of this story, and the diversity of jobs makes this crowd stand out. None of these characters are whom you&#39;d normally expect to see together. At a minimum, this might be one of the first times the V-tuber profession has been committed to animation.




All in all, it may seem easy to write off this new show as just another cute slice-of-life, but the art shown in the trailer promises a more dramatic and intense story that focuses on life in the city itself. It&#39;s evocative of other anime like Call of the Night or Ya Boy Kongming!, which also similarly provided an optimistic look at urban living, awash with color even at its dingiest. Combined with the atypical position of its cast as creatives, Jellyfish Can&#39;t Swim in the Night might be a sleeper hit when it arrives in April 2024.
