## Literature Review

Dragon Ball&#39;s future has Trunks fighting for his life against the evil Androids 17 and 18, with new fanart showing Trunks triumphant in his revenge.




In Dragon Ball’s near future, the fan-favorite characters of Trunks and Gohan are the only surviving heroes fighting a seemingly unwinnable war against a pair of evil androids who have left the world in ruin. And now, in a fitting new piece of fanart, Future Trunks exacts his revenge on Androids 17 and 18 and finally lays to rest an invaluable mentor and friend who made him into the warrior he is today.




Shared on social media via Instagram by Fellipe (@fellipart), this creative talent is all about dreaming up and sketching out unique Dragon Ball fanart that rivals and at times even exceeds the official illustrations made by series creator Akira Toriyama and current Dragon Ball Super artist Toyotarou.


 

Often creating images that are highly detailed in their brutal depiction of Dragon Ball’s signature fights as well as the iconic characters who partake in them, Fellipe has recently uploaded artwork showing off Ultra Ego Vegeta’s ultimate power against Black Frieza, Super Saiyan Goku as he takes on the Legendary Saiyan that is Broly and even Beast Gohan readying for a battle of epic proportions, never failing to impress with each new piece.

                  Dragon Ball&#39;s Future Trunks Looks More Badass Than Ever In Cool New Art   Future Trunks hails from a battle-ravaged time where he&#39;s constantly fighting for his life, with new fanart depicting him as the badass hero he is.   





 Future Trunks Buries His Mentor In New Dragon Ball Fanart 
          

Hailing from an alternate timeline where the ruthless Android 17 and Android 18 were never defeated, this future saw Gohan take Trunks under his wing and teach the young hero how to channel his power to become a combatant worthy of the Z-Fighter name. Losing his arm in battle and then tragically losing his life, Gohan never lived to see Trunks ascend to the Super Saiyan level in the anime nor witnessed him go back in time, with the knowledge and strength Trunks received in the past being exactly what he needed to handily defeat his enemies in the future.

Shown walking towards the camera wearing battle-damaged clothing and sporting long hair and a scowl that he undoubtedly learned from his father, Fellipe positions Trunks a few feet in front of a gravestone that reads “RIP Son Gohan,” with his signature sword stuck in the ground right next to it and a strip of Gohan’s gi tied to its handle drawing attention to the subtle reflections of Androids 17 and 18 added to its steel. Appropriately captioning this image with “You have been avenged,” Fellipe’s attention to detail accentuates the struggle Trunks has faced in his continued efforts to exact revenge for Gohan’s death, finally giving the character a sense of peace that has eluded him for so long.

This moment when Trunks buries his teacher and friend hasn’t been seen in Dragon Ball lore before (though his younger years have been chronicled in Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks), and with Fellipe (@fellipart) on the case, fans get to experience a bittersweet end to a hero who has finally been awarded the eternal rest he so rightly deserves. Trunks and Gohan had their work cut out for them in a future they thought they couldn’t save, and even if this Dragon Ball fanart isn’t canon, it’s good to see their hard work pay off, especially when victory was never guaranteed for these iconic Z-Warriors.
