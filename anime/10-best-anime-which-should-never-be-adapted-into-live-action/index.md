# 10 Best Anime Which Should Never Be Adapted Into Live Action


## SUMMARY 


 Live-action adaptations of anime face challenges that can lead to infamously bad adaptations, but some have overcome these obstacles and become hits. 
 Certain anime series, like Spy X Family and K-On!, would lose their best comedic moments or require actors with musical abilities, making live-action adaptations logistically difficult. 
 Some anime series, such as Little Witch Academia and My Hero Academia, would draw unfair comparisons or lose their distinct visual identity when adapted to live action.

## Literature Review

The creative process of adapting animation to live action presents certain pitfalls that are best avoided for several popular anime franchises.




The creative process of adapting anime to live-action presents certain pitfalls that are best avoided for several popular anime franchises. These challenges have led to infamously bad live-action adaptations of popular anime. At the same time, some of these live-action adaptations have overcome such obstacles to become runaway hits. Nevertheless, there are still some anime series that should never be adapted into live-action. These series absolutely will not work in any medium other than anime.
Overall, live-action anime adaptations have a bit of a mixed track record. While live-action adaptations of anime that have been produced in Japan have generally been better received, several Western adaptations have also become hits. The Netflix live-action One Piece has become viewed as one of the best live-action anime adaptations yet, while Detective Pikachu drew from both the Pok√©mon video games and anime series to do well with critics and at the box office. Unfortunately, in some cases, it&#39;s just not worth the risks of such an adaptation as some anime should never be adapted to live-action.









 








 10  Record Of Lodoss War 
Elves Wouldn&#39;t Look Good in Live Action
       Record of Lodoss War/AIC  

  Year Released   1990    Number of Episodes   13    where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation    
Historically, live-action fantasy works have struggled to depict elf ears convincingly on-screen. Even big-budget fantasy works with universally praised costumes and effects like Peter Jackson&#39;s Lord of the Rings and Amazon&#39;s Rings of Power have struggled to depict elf ears well in live-action, with both opting for small, subtle, barely pointed ears. Since anime elves are generally depicted with significantly longer, narrower ears, any live-action version of Record of Lodoss War&#39;s Deedlit would be a challenge to realize well on-screen, further complicated by the fact that Deedlit is one of the most important characters in the series and would be frequently on-screen, meaning that her ear would need to be depicted exceptionally well or would become a near-constant distraction for the audience.

 9  Spy X Family  
The Best Visual Gags Wouldn&#39;t Work in Live-Action
        

  Year Released   2022    Number of Episodes   30    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Thanks to being based on real-life mid-20th century Germany, Spy X Family has a fairly grounded art style that wouldn&#39;t be too hard to replicate in live action. With the exception of Yor&#39;s implausible hairstyle and Anya&#39;s bright pink hair, most of the characters could be adapted to live-action with no changes. However, a live-action adaptation would be missing the manga and anime&#39;s greatest strength. Some of the Spy x Family&#39;s funniest moments come from the characters&#39;, usually Anya&#39;s, hilariously drawn reaction faces. Since this wouldn&#39;t be possible to replicate with real actors, a live-action Spy X Family would be missing its inspiration&#39;s best comedic moments.

 8  K-On! 
Would Need to Cast Actors Who Are Also Musicians
        

  Year Released   2009    Number of Episodes   39 &#43; 2 OVAs    Where to Stream it   HiDive    
Casting a live-action K-On! presents one obvious challenge. As one of the best anime series about musicians, the cast of K-On! would necessarily need musical abilities. This consequently gives the producers of a hypothetical live-action K-On! a rather smaller potential casting pool. Not only would the actors need to either be actually high-school age or at least able to believably pass for high-school age, they would also need to be able to play the same instruments as their characters. While it would be conceivably possible to have the actors pretend to sing, play the instruments, and then dub in the music over the footage, being able to do this convincingly and hide the fact that actors are lip-syncing would be significantly more difficult to accomplish in live action than in animation.

 7  Little Witch Academia  
Would Be Dismissed as a Harry Potter Rip-Off
        

  Year Released   2017    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Netflix    
As a story about the students of a school for magic, Little Witch Academia already inevitably draws comparisons to Harry Potter. These would only increase with a live-action adaptation. This association with Harry Potter would potentially harm a Little Witch Academia adaptation, given that the Harry Potter franchise seems to be at a very low point recently, and J.K. Rowling herself has alienated a large portion of the fanbase with her comments on social media. Fundamentally, this association with Harry Potter is also completely unfair to Little Witch Academia. Beyond the superficial similarity of both taking place at a magic school, Little Witch Academia actually has very little in common with Harry Potter. If anything, Little Witch Academia is infinitely more similar to the Worst Witch series.

 6  Vinland Saga  
Would Feel Less Distinct


 







  Year Released   2019    Number of Episodes   48    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Netflix, Prime Video, HiDive    
Gritty, epic historical fiction has had a market since at least as far back as HBO&#39;s Rome. There would certainly be interest in a potential live-action Vinland Saga. On the other hand, to work in live-action, the most stylized aspects of the series would likely have to be toned down or altered. This would likely do more harm than good to the adaptation, as it would make Vinland Saga much less visually and thematically distinct. This would be particularly detrimental, given that the Vikings TV series and especially its sequel Vikings: Valhalla cover much of the same historical ground as Vinland Saga in live-action. A live-action Vinland Saga wouldn&#39;t necessarily do enough to set itself apart.

 5  Oshi no Ko  
A High Potential to Come Across as Hypocritical


 







  Year Released   2023    Number of Episodes   11    Where to Stream it   HiDive    
On the one hand, Oshi no Ko really lends itself to a live-action adaptation, with several live-action series about the idol industry already existing. On the other hand, a scathing denunciation of the Japanese entertainment industry being created by that very same industry seems to lack self-awareness at best and be massively hypocritical at worst.
The original Oshi no Ko manga is a sufficiently different genre and industry to avoid most of these issues, but a live-action Oshi no Ko has the major potential to be incredibly uncomfortable. The Oshi no Ko manga and anime have already been criticized as exploiting real-life tragedies that struck the Japanese entertainment industry and these issues would only be amplified in a live-action adaptation.

 4  My Hero Academia  
Would Have to Compromise its Unique Visual Identity


 







  Year Released   2016    Number of Episodes   138 &#43; 9 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
One of My Hero Academia&#39;s greatest strengths is its very idiosyncratic, instantly recognizable character designs. For example, All Might&#39;s fully powered form is a superhuman muscular colossus, while his injured, de-powered form is scrawny and almost skeletal. This is easy enough to depict in animation but would be hard to do in live action without suffering from the Uncanny Valley effect. All Might is the best example of My Hero Academia&#39;s character designs, but the majority of the cast have powers, costumes, or appearances in general that would either be hard to depict in live action without looking silly or would require being toned down significantly and thus lose most of their visual uniqueness.

 3  The Heroic Legend of Arslan 
Would Need a Massive Budget
        

  Year Released   2015    Number of Episodes   35    Where to Stream it   Funimation    
In theory, a live-action Heroic Legend of Arslan would likely appeal to fans of epic, large-scale stories of warfare and political intrigue like Game of Thrones. Practically, however, an adaptation would require a huge budget for not only the series&#39; elaborate costumes and settings but also for the cast of extras or CGI effects necessary to do the series&#39; battle scenes justice. The Heroic Legend of Arslan is too niche to make such a budget profitable. Additionally, given that the series is inspired by Iranian mythology and history, such as depicted in the epic poem known as the Shahnameh, an adaptation of The Heroic Legend of Arslan has major potential for controversial casting choices on the producers&#39; part.

 2  Berserk 
Would Struggle to Depict its Darkest Subject Matter


 







  Year Released   1997    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Currently unavailable to stream    
Berserk&#39;s plot has been driven by dark and grim storylines from the very first page of the original manga back in 1989. Since then, Berserk has become known as one of the bleakest and most unrelenting Dark Fantasy franchises ever. Berserk is filled with violence, nudity, and incredibly disturbing scenes and storylines. Notably, much of this dark and disturbing content has prevented many storylines in the original manga from being depicted even in Berserk&#39;s anime adaptations. All of these issues would be compounded by the live-action medium. On a more basic level, although many of the human characters like Guts himself wouldn&#39;t be too challenging to depict well on-screen, the monsters, demons, and especially the Apostles would be difficult to do justice in live-action.





 1  KonoSuba  
Would Be So CGI-Heavy that Adapting it Would Feel Pointless


 







  Year Released   2016    Number of Episodes   20 &#43; 2 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
With the exception of Aqua&#39;s bright blue hair, the main cast of KonoSuba have fairly simple designs that could be adapted to live-action pretty while. On the other hand, much of the rest of the series&#39; world would be hard to adapt well. There are enough non-human characters and enemies, uses of visually stylish magic, and even just fantastical flourishes to the set design that the series would be heavily reliant on CGI. Turning an originally animated series into such a CGI-reliant live-action series feels redundant and unnecessary, especially because the original art style would almost certainly end up being preferred by the audience and be viewed as a major hit to the reputation of one of the most popular Isekai anime series.

It&#39;s true that some anime have served as the basis for successful and popular live-action series. Many others have been unable to overcome the artistic challenges posed by such adaptations. There&#39;s always a chance such an adaptation will succeed, but it simply isn&#39;t worth the risk for the top anime series that should never be adapted into live-action.
