## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #18 will begin a new arc for the series, with Frieren taking a Mage certification exam to continue traveling.




After a brief hiatus, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End has returned with a stellar new installment that sets up a new arc beginning in episode #18. The fantasy series is generally episodic and thus doesn&#39;t usually feature overarching storylines, but the show&#39;s new opening and the amount of buildup put into the next location Frieren is traveling make this a likely exception. This will allow the series to delve more deeply into its new characters than it generally does.

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #17 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on January 12. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on January 12 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #17? 
          

Episode #17 featured Sein&#39;s decision to leave the party in search of his friend, which was set up in the previous episode. However, before he left Frieren, Stark, Fern, and Sein were all trapped together for a month by a sudden blizzard. The time they spent together was a great sendoff for Sein, who helped settle an argument between Fern and Stark that hinted at their growing feelings for one another. Sein&#39;s departure was also incredibly poignant as he noted how quiet traveling alone was compared to traveling with Frieren&#39;s party. The rest of the episode featured Frieren and Stark helping Fern recover from an illness before they set out to the city where Frieren will have to get her Mage certification.






The episode also featured an excellent new OP and ED.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #18 Will Begin the Mage Exam 
          

Episode #18 is titled “First Class Mage Exam”, which implies that Frieren and her friends will finally reach the city they have been traveling towards ever since they defeated the fascinating demonic villains threatening Granat’s lands many episodes ago. While there, they will have to pass the titular exam once they reach the city, this should be relatively easy to do for a mage of Frieren&#39;s caliber. It may be a bit trickier for Fern if she tries to take it, however, given she is a bit less adept than her mentor. Frieren and Fern will also likely have to deal with the judgment of the mages living in the city and taking the test, which could open up another avenue of conflict.




With the show&#39;s new opening providing hints of the many characters that lie ahead in Außerst, the promise of a new arc is more exciting than ever. While Frieren has been revolutionary for its more episodic structure, its longer arcs have also been excellent. When Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #18 airs on Crunchyroll on Friday, January 12, it will hopefully prove that this upcoming plotline will be no exception.

Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #18 when it airs on Crunchyroll on January 12, 2024.
