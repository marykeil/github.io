## Literature Review

Whether they stand back and snipe enemies from afar, or run in with guns blazing, anime characters who wield firearms are always some of the coolest.





When it comes to the firearms that are commonly seen in anime, they can vary significantly, with some characters being devoted snipers who value strategic positioning and stealthy operations, while others charge into the action wielding pistols and enjoying the thrill of the battle. Whether they rely on their own strength or amplify their skills with magic, sharpshooters always know how to adapt to the battlefield.









 








 10  Tanya von Degurechaff (Saga of Tanya the Evil) 
        

Saga of Tanya the Evil&#39;s titular protagonist Tanya von Degurechaff is a reincarnated girl living in a world defined by magical warfare. Thanks to her magical aptitude, combat talent, and analysis skills, she dominates the battlefield and rises through military ranks with ease. While she is seen wielding different types of weapons, she primarily relies on guns when fighting her enemies. Furthermore, by praying to Being X, she can further boost her skills, gaining highly amplified accuracy when shooting, as well as the ability to cast an incredibly potent explosive spell. Proving her mastery over air warfare, she has even gained nicknames such as &#34;The Devil of The Rhine&#34;.





 9  Sinon (Sword Art Online II) 
        

Sinon is one of the main characters of Sword Art Online II&#39;s Phantom Bullet Arc, wherein she is noted to be one of the best Gun Gale Online players. Struggling with an intense fear of guns caused by a tragic incident, she initially starts playing the game as a way to overcome her trauma. After accidentally triggering a trap and getting stuck in a powerful boss monster&#39;s stadium, she strategically positions herself outside its attack area and continually shoots its weak points. Armed with the rare anti-materiel rifle she earned as a reward, as well as the Hawk-Eye skill, which boosts her sight, she is an unrivaled sniper.





 8  Death the Kid (Soul Eater) 
        

The events of Soul Eater mostly take place in a school known as the Death Weapon Meister Academy, where meisters and demon weapons are trained to control their powers and integrate into society. The headmaster of this school is the Grim Reaper Death himself, and Death the Kid is his son. Being a grim reaper, Kid&#39;s physical abilities are far beyond those of his peers, which is why he is recognized as one of the academy&#39;s top students. Even without considering his special abilities, Kid is highly skilled in gun techniques, wielding the Demon Twin Guns Patricia and Elizabeth Thompson.





 7  Vash The Stampede (Trigun Stampede) 
        

As Trigun Stampede&#39;s titular protagonist, Vash The Stampede travels from town to town, often causing chaos, which is how he gains the title of The Humanoid Typhoon as well as a huge bounty on his head. While Vash is not actually human and has the ability to use special powers, he rarely uses them because he would rather rely on his cybernetic arm and his trustworthy revolver; moreover, a pacifist by nature, he only fights when absolutely necessary. Regardless, he is shown to be a highly proficient marksman, requiring but a single bullet to shoot down dozens of falling explosives.





 6  Guido Mista (JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind) 
        

As a core ally in JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, Guido Mista is perhaps best known for his fear of the number 4, as well as his Stand, Sex Pistols. Admittedly, even without using his Stand&#39;s power, Mista is a naturally gifted sharpshooter, who can hit his targets and keep his calm under any circumstances. Sex Pistols is composed of six small entities, numbered 1 through 7 (to avoid the number 4), who usually participate in combat by riding Mista&#39;s bullets; they enhance Mista&#39;s power dramatically, not only reloading his gun and scouting for him but also allowing him to deflect and control flying bullets.





 5  Riza Hawkeye (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) 
        

Although Riza Hawkeye may not play a central role in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, she is one of the more memorable characters nonetheless, particularly for fans who were impressed by her sharpshooting skills. As the personal adjutant and bodyguard of Colonel Roy Mustang, Riza proves to be an invaluable asset on the battlefield, leveraging her experience with firearms to gain the upper hand. Not only can she quickly repair and reassemble firearms in record time, but she&#39;s also well known for never missing her mark, whether she&#39;s wielding sniper rifles, pistols, or even dual-wielding handguns. Even in a world dominated by alchemists, Riza can hold her own against the series&#39; strongest characters.





 4  Yoko Littner (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) 
        

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann&#39;s Yoko Littner joins Kamina and Simon&#39;s Team Gurren after running into them when chasing Gunmen. Given the nature of the show, she is naturally skilled in piloting Gunmen, yet there is far more to her strength than that. Yoko also brings most of the firepower to the team, being a proficient wielder of various firearms, the most common of which is a Superconducting Rifle. She masterfully uses this railgun to hit weak spots even on fast-moving targets, sometimes taking out multiple enemies without being injured at all. Moreover, she also keeps a pistol on her at all times, in case using her main gun isn&#39;t an option.





 3  Alucard (Hellsing Ultimate) 
        

As unholy beings are supposed to avoid silver, given its status as a holy metal, it may come as a surprise that Hellsing Ultimate&#39;s Alucard, an extremely powerful vampire, relies on silver. The twist is that Alucard is not only a vampire himself, but also a vampire hunter. To this end, he wields two iconic guns, one of which uses silver bullets, and the other using baptized bullets. Casull and Jackal, as his pistols are named, were designed and created specifically for him, and he is the only one who could possibly wield them, thanks to his superhuman strength. His vampire abilities further boost his combat prowess, making him nearly invincible.





 2  Revy (Black Lagoon) 
        

Black Lagoon&#39;s titular Lagoon Company is a group that handles various tasks, including shipping and smuggling, primarily working for criminal organizations. Revy is the main fighter of the group, having both the personality and the skills to back up her position. She&#39;s generally cynical, loud, and aggressive, always trying to get her way through brute force. Moreover, her talent for combat is unparalleled; not only is she able to maneuver through crowds and dodge bullets like no one else, but she is also an incredibly skilled gunfighter, masterfully wielding various weapons, from her usual modified Beretta 92F&#39;s, to submachine guns, and even grenade launchers.





 1  Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop) 
        

As one of Cowboy Bebop&#39;s main characters, Spike Spiegel is a force to be reckoned with, boasting numerous strengths. Yet, while his skills in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat are certainly noteworthy in his journey as a bounty hunter traveling through space, it&#39;s his penchant for weaponry that puts him on this list. Spike&#39;s personal gun of choice is a Jericho 941, whose modifications and customizations say a lot about his history and personality. Furthermore, he also happens to be known for his sharp eyesight and acute perception, which certainly help him win gunfights as well. When worse comes to worst though, he can always count on his exceptional luck.
Whether they keep their calm in battle, always looking for the next weak spot to hit, or are instead more hot-headed, seemingly shooting away without a thought, characters who use guns can vary a lot in terms of personality and fighting style. Some use pistols, other snipers, and some even use both, but they all know how to appreciate effective weaponry, using their accuracy and strategy skills to win fights efficiently. Anime fans who are passionate about guns may notice the finer details and references, but even those unfamiliar with the subject can appreciate just how cool anime gunslingers are.
