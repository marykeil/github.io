# Bleach Anime Director Makes Controversial AI Statements At The Worst Possible Time


## SUMMARY 



  Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War director Tomohisa Taguchi&#39;s comments on AI in anime are tone-deaf and in bad taste considering recent industry controversies.   The comments made by Taguchi and Crayon Shin-chan director Keiichi Hara seem to make light of the issues surrounding Studio MAPPA and its toxic work environment.   The controversy raises the question of whether AI has a place in anime, but based on past examples, it seems that AI is not suitable for the medium.

## Literature Review

Anime production and AI have been two highly controversial topics in recent years, and recent comments from Bleach&#39;s director have fed into both.




Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War director Tomohisa Taguchi has decided to comment on AI as a creative tool, and his timing couldn’t be worse. Over the past few years, AI has been a highly contentious topic because of the fear of it replacing creatives and how willing executives have been to let it happen, with the recent SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes revolving heavily around limiting its use in media production.




Anime isn’t exempt from the discussion of AI, and Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War director Tomohisa Taguchi has stirred up controversy surrounding it. As reported on by Fullfrontal Moe, at a panel during the 2023 Annecy Film Festival, Taguchi and Crayon Shin-chan director Keiichi Hara revealed their thoughts on AI&#39;s place in anime.


 


Tomohisa Taguchi (Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War) and Keiichi Hara (Colorful) think that AI might be a good tool to &#34;replace lazy animators who don&#39;t get the work done&#34;. Some quite peculiar and unexpected comments.


While the exact translation wasn&#39;t posted, if Full Frontal Moe&#39;s account of the panel is accurate, then it appears as though Taguchi and Hara agreed that AI could be used to replace &#34;lazy animators.&#34; What makes the comments particularly surprising is the context of ongoing conversations about problems with the anime industry, particularly what&#39;s been allegedly happening at MAPPA.





 Bleach Anime Director Suggests AI Could Replace Animators 
          

The biggest sticking point with Tomohisa Taguchi and Keiichi Hara’s comments about AI is how they seem to make light of the controversies surrounding Studio MAPPA. Studio MAPPA has long been criticized for cultivating a toxic work environment, and that’s only gotten worse over time, with many animators involved in Jujutsu Kaisen season 2’s production taking to X to comment on how severely overworked and underpaid they’ve been. 

In Tomohisa Taguchi and Keiichi Hara’s defense, however, neither of them specifically called out Studio MAPPA employees, so their comments seem to be more of a generalization. Not only that, but Keiichi Hara acknowledged that some people do have to leave projects because of pressure and being overworked. Even so, the fact that they appear to make generalizations about animators as a means of supporting AI has more than a few anime fans upset.




Anime fans responding to Full Frontal&#39;s repot were particularly incensed, with X user CrimsonGP18 saying &#34;Oh, sorry that animators don&#39;t want to work in a sweatshop for sweatshop pay.&#34; User Azmodeus RedBeard summarized many anime fans&#39; feelings well, writing &#34;Yeah, this is both disrespectful and callous to All their current staff. It also doesn&#39;t bode well to quality we can expect, going forward. At best they are both less informed then they think. At worst, they want to produce work regardless of it&#39;s quality or the human cost.&#34;


 


 






 Does AI Have A Place In Anime? 
          

With Tomohisa Taguchi and Keiichi Hara stirring up controversy surrounding AI in anime, that invites the question of whether or not AI has a place in anime. While there aren’t many examples of AI in anime, Corridor Digital’s Rock, Paper, Scissors was criticized for using AI, so it&#39;s a conversation that&#39;s on the mind of many anime fans. Regardless of what role AI will play in the future of anime though, the response to Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War director Tomohisa Taguchi&#39;s comments show that issues like AI and the treatment of animators are important and should be approached with a certain level of care.
