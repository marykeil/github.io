# Shonen Jump Proves How Scary its Newest Villain is With a Surprising Scene


## SUMMARY 



  MamaYuyu&#39;s main villain, Grisha, breaks the mold of typical Shonen Jump antagonists with surprising and unique character moments such as resurrecting a child, only for them to collapse into goo.   Unlike most ultimate foes in Shonen series, Grisha confronts the protagonist face to face and humanizes himself with his reaction to a kiss, making him more compelling and unpredictable.   Grisha&#39;s immaturity and unpredictability, combined with his immense power, sets him apart and makes him a potential contender for one of Shonen Jump&#39;s best new villains.

## Literature Review

The new Shonen Jump fantasy series MamaYuyu just proved how its main antagonist Grisha is unique in an extremely fun and compelling way.




Warning! Contains spoilers for MamaYuyu Chapter #17!




Shonen Jump features some of the best antagonists in manga and a new series showed that its villain deserves to be considered as part of that group with one surprising scene. That manga, MamaYuyu by Yoshihiko Hayashi, has already made a name for itself by being very innovative with the classic tropes of the Hero and the Demon Lord. Its latest chapter shows it can also be creative with the concept of its main villain.

In chapter #17, translated by David Evelyn with lettering by Finn K., the main villain of the series Grisha appears before the protagonist Corleo, and his ally Elysia after they incapacitate their enemy Kuptula. Grisha had recruited Kuptula to his cause by promising to resurrect her child and he fulfills this promise to her here, bringing back her dead son. However, the resurrection is unstable and the kid collapses into goo, which surprises Grisha and stains his coat.

          




Later Grisha agrees to call off his attack in exchange for recruiting Minerva to his side, but not before that idol demon gives Corleo a kiss, which flusters the villain of the series right alongside Elysia.


 MamaYuyu&#39;s Villain Is Unique From Other Shonen Jump Antagonists 
          

These surprising moments in this chapter make Grisha unique from other main antagonists in Shonen Jump. Most of the time the ultimate villain of a Shonen series is treated as a serious and aloof figure, more dignified than the more commonplace villains beneath them. They also rarely directly fight with the protagonist until the final arcs of the series. Grisha goes against both of these tropes in this chapter by confronting Corleo face to face and humanizing himself with his reaction to the kiss. Instead of making him less threatening, this actually makes him much more unique and compelling than a more standard foe.




Grisha at this point in the series feels more like a petulant child with too much power than a malevolent schemer like My Hero Academia&#39;s All For One. As such he is fine playing with people&#39;s lives and emotions just because he can such as with Kuptula&#39;s son, only caring that his suit gets stained instead of the trauma it likely inflicted on her. He can also be much more silly without losing his threatening aura, such as when he reacted to Corleo&#39;s kiss. This immaturity and unpredictability makes him compelling to watch and if MamaYuyu manages to avoid the Under 19 Club long enough to develop him further he could become one of Shonen Jump&#39;s best new villains.



While he is powerful, his inability to fully revive Kuptula&#39;s son implies Grisha is still relatively weak as well.






 Hopefully MamaYuyu Influences Future Shonen Jump Villains 
          




Grisha fits in nicely among a new generation of villains who defy genre expectations, like the disturbing Takauji from Shonen Jump&#39;s The Elusive Samurai. The villain he may be closest to is Kaiju No. 9 from Kaiju No. 8, who also had to grow over the course of that series. Hopefully even more new Shonen Jump series will be able to follow in MamaYuyu&#39;s example and create compelling and unpredictable villains like Grisha.
