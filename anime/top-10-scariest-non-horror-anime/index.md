## Literature Review

While horror anime is well-known for being a quick fix for anime fans wanting to indulge in something darker, other genres have equally scary moments.




The series listed in this article contain sensitive contain some viewers may find disturbing. 

There&#39;s an abundance of excellent, thrilling horror anime available for fans. However, anime from other genrea are also up to the task of delivering effective thrills and scares. Although their focus isn&#39;t on horror, these anime still manage to be deeply and truly scary. Anime fans looking for scares may also be interested in the scariest non-horror anime.
Plenty of non-horror anime have had memorably scary moments. Thanks to effective art direction or storylines based on disturbing content, some non-horror anime can be just as scary as anime that are actually considered horror, despite being ostensibly based on other genres.









 








 11  Oshi no Ko 
        

Even before the twist at the end of the first episode, which is probably the single most disturbing scene in the series, there are plenty of indicates that Oshi no Ko is a scathing indictment of the Japanese entertainment industry. Overall, Oshi no Ko doesn&#39;t hesitate to depict the darkest aspects of life as an idol singer or TV star. While plotlines involving stalkers and obsessed fans are unsettling in general, they&#39;re made even worse by the fact that the many of Oshi no Ko&#39;s most disturbing events are based on real tragedie.





 10  Cells at Work 
        

Despite being a superficially cute and whimsical series, Cells at Work isn&#39;t shy about depicting all the horrible things that can happen to a human body. Despite abstracting and anthropomorphizing the cells in human characters, Cells at Work has been praised by doctors for its medical accuracy.
Cells at Work depicts the various diseases that can affect the human body as monsters and villains. Unsurprisingly, Cancer is depicted as both the biggest threat and the most horrifying individual character. Appearing as a normal cell, Cancer is eventually revealed to be a monstrous shape-shifter with a disgusting true form, and a desire to replicate himself without limits, presented in the series itself as an equivalent to super-villain who wants to take over or destroy the entire world. It&#39;s an effective and chilling way of depicting Cancer within Cells at Work&#39;s premise.





 9  Cyberpunk Edgerunners 
       Adam Smasher in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners  

 Cyberpunk stories don&#39;t usually have uplifting stories or happy endings. Edgerunners absolutely nails the tone of genre. The world is visually bright and slick, but actually bleak and morally bankrupt. The characters&#39; cybernetic enhancements, particularly their actual installation in the characters&#39; bodies, are depicted with nightmarish detail. Adam Smasher, a longtime icon in the original Cyberpunk tabletop game and a major antagonist in the Cyberpunk 2077 video game is single-handedly responsible for a large portion of Edgerunners&#39; scariest moments, depicted as both a cybernetic monstrosity and an unstoppable juggernaut in battle. While not necessarily as one-sided as Adam Smasher&#39;s annihilation of the heroes, the other fights in Edgerunners are still brutal and violent.





 8  Attack on Titan 
Attack on Titan establishes its tone in decisive fashion almost immediately. The first two episodes detail the events of a human settlement being overrun by Titans. Right away, the Titans featured throughout the anime, in all their terrifying different forms, earn their place as some of anime&#39;s most terrifying monsters.
Kaiju-sized monsters are scary in general, due to representing overwhelming odds against the human protagonists, but the Titans are even worse than most other kaiju. Thanks to their human-like appearance, they evoke a deep Uncanny Valley reaction, being human enough to be recognizable but inhuman enough to be deeply unsettling. The Smiling Titan is particularly creepy, as it seems to be actively enjoying the destruction and terror it&#39;s causing.





 7  Godzilla Singular Point 
        

Although Godzilla Singular Point&#39;s explanations about quantum mechanics are essentially accurate, they can be hard to understand. Because of this, the series establishes that its interdimensional take on Godzilla can&#39;t entirely be understood by humans. This version of Godzilla isn&#39;t a walking nuclear bomb, but an unknowable Cthulhu-like entity that threatens to unravel reality just by existing. It makes Godzilla scary in a whole new way, complemented by a fantastically creepy design. The other kajiu received similar redesigns, and the fact that they&#39;re all scaled down to more comparably human sizes actually makes them scarier, allowing them to interact with and imperil the human characters more directly and immediately.





 6  Record of Ragnarok 
        

Conceptually, Record of Ragnarok is a lot like Mortal Kombat. It&#39;s graphic and the violence is over-the-top, with the combatants being grievously injured and killed in full detail on-screen. Additionally, among both the gods and humans, many of the tournament fighters have very cruel and sadistic personalities. It&#39;s also quite thematically unsettling. The gods have decided to wipe out humanity, and despite being bound to give humanity a chance in fighting a tournament of champions, the fact that the gods can wipe out all of humanity on a whim is constantly hanging over the series.





 5  Princess Mononoke 
Studio Ghibli has historically been hit pretty hard by the North American idea that all animation is supposed to be for kids. The infamous heavily edited first English release of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind let Hayao Miyazaki to institute a no-cuts policy for later English releases of his movies.
Clearly, Princess Mononoke adhered to this policy. Although Neil Gaiman&#39;s English script made a few changes to some of the dialogue so the story would be more digestible for English-speaking audiences, none of the content was removed or significantly altered. The English version of Princess Mononoke is still graphically violent and still full of nightmarish visuals, mostly notable the corruption afflicting the animal gods, represented as a writhing mass of worm-like tentacles. On top of that, Princess Mononoke is also thematically quite cynical about humanity and modernity.





 4  Puella Magi Madoka Magica 
Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a brutal deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre, launching an entire dark and iconoclastic sub-genre in the process. While even iconic Magical Girl series like Sailor Moon have their darker moments, but Madoka commits fully to a dark tone and the series quickly establishes that the typical Magical approach of fighting evil head-on is exactly the wrong choice in this world. That evil takes the form of monsters called Witches, who are conceptually terrifying, presented as a legitimate and lethal threat, and drawn and animated with creepy and cool tendency to blend different art styles that deliberately clash with the series&#39; main style to effectively demonstrate their otherworldliness.





 3  Black Lagoon 
        

Black Lagoon can be hard to get into because none of the characters are particularly likable. The series is like a darker, more violent and grounded take on Cowboy Bebop. The characters are almost all outlaws navigating a brutal and ruthless criminal underworld and the frequent, graphic violence of the series reflects that. Even the main protagonists are really only sympathetic by comparison to their enemies. Black Lagoon may be stylized, but there are no supernatural elements in the story. The scariest thing about Black Lagoon is that most of what&#39;s being depicted on-screen is frighteningly plausible in the real world.





 2  Neon Genesis Evangelion 
        

The visual designs the Angels and the EVA Units are both phenomenally creepy. The EVAs are the perfect combination of mechanical and organic components, while the Angels are absolutely bewildering, with most of them taking the form of abstract geometrical objects rather than anything even remotely resembling a living being. This perfectly captures their otherworldly, unknowable nature. On top of this, Evangelion delves deep into human psychology, with most of the major characters struggling to process some sort of trauma in their backstory, coupled with the series not flinching it is depiction of the psychological and emotional impact of compelling teenagers to pilot giant war machines in battle against terrifying alien opponents.





 1  Berserk 
        

Berserk has become one of the most iconic dark fantasy anime series of all time, and it has really proved itself worthy of that honor. Although Berserk is a compelling series, the all-pervading darkness of the plot can make it an exhausting experience. Most of the supernatural beings of the series&#39; world are actively malevolent or uncaring about humanity. The world is filled with monsters with unsettling visual designs. There are numerous disturbing storylines. Berserk&#39;s iconic fight scenes are artistically phenomenal, but unrelentingly brutal and violent. Even many of the simple human characters are capable of unspeakable acts of brutality and cruelty.
Just because an anime isn&#39;t officially in the horror genre doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be genuinely scary. Thanks to some unsettling storyline and brilliantly creepy visual design, some non-horror anime have created scares to rival anything in a pure horror anime. Even traditional horror fans will likely be won over by some of the scariest non-horror anime.
