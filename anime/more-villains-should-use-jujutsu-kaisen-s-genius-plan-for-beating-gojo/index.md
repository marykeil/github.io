# More Villains Should Use Jujutsu Kaisen s Genius Plan For Beating Gojo


## SUMMARY 



  Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s villains employ an ingenious strategy to defeat Gojo in a cramped subway tunnel, using innocent bystanders as a shield to prevent him from going all out.   This tactic would be effective against most shonen protagonists obsessed with protecting the innocent and not killing, making it a stymieing ploy.   The plan could work better on other heroes who are less powerful and more emotionally affected by seeing large amounts of death.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s villains concocted a twisted plan to defeat the incredibly powerful sorcerer Gojo that other shonen antagonists should use.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2!




While Gojo is one of the strongest characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, the series&#39; villains were able to come up with an ingenious plan to defeat him that more antagonists should use. Of course, not every antagonist can stop low enough to pull off this plan depending on how moral they are. If more anime villains adopt this plan, however, it could lead other series to become much more violent and disturbing.

In season 2, episode 8, Jogo and Hanami force Gojo to fight in the relatively cramped confines of a subway tunnel. Things are made difficult for Gojo when the curses bring the surrounding mass of civilians onto the track with them, murdering them indiscriminately in a shocking display of callous violence.

          

While this doesn&#39;t seem to psychologically affect Gojo as much as it would some other shonen heroes, the mass of people serves another, far more sinister purpose. If Gojo went all out with his techniques, he could easily defeat the two curses, but if he did that he would also kill all the innocent bystanders in the station making him a mass murderer.

For villains as immoral as Hanami and Jogo, this sort of strategy would be effective against most shonen protagonists. Of course, there are a variety of villains in shonen manga with nobler standards that likely wouldn&#39;t stoop to such a low, so this stratagem wouldn&#39;t be useful for them. In addition, some shonen protagonists don&#39;t actually care too much about keeping innocent bystanders alive, such as the unique hero Denji from Chainsaw Man. These sorts of heroes are the exception, however, and against a typical protagonist obsessed with protecting the innocent and not killing, this is an ingenious ploy that is almost guaranteed to stymie them.

It&#39;s honestly shocking how few villains have employed this tactic in the history of shonen manga, given how simple it is. Of course, it makes sense that Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s disturbing villains who are some of the most twisted in the genre would be the ones to come up with it. It was also more necessary for them to use a ploy like this given Gojo&#39;s overwhelming power level. This strategy even worked by forcing Gojo to tire himself out before deploying the Prison Realm to seal him.






 The Curses&#39; Plan Would Work Better In a Different Series 
          

If this strategy could work on Gojo, it could definitely succeed against the protagonists of other Shonen manga. Most are much less powerful than Gojo and would likely be more emotionally affected by seeing large amounts of death than the aloof sorcerer is. Thus, more villains in other shonen manga should copy this brilliant and disturbing tactic of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s antagonists to triumph over their heroic enemies.
