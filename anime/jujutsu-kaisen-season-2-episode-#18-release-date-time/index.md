## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #18 will focus on Nanami&#39;s return and also show what the rest of the Shibuya Incident arc will be like.




After what is arguably the best episode in the entire series, the fate of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #18 is unfortunately shrouded in uncertainty. The studio producing Jujutsu Kaisen has been accused of horribly mistreating its workers, which has apparently caused production on the Shibuya Incident arc to hit some major snags. It is unclear whether this will cause the later episodes of the season to be delayed or whether the rest of the arc will be released as originally planned.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #18 Releases 
          

If it isn&#39;t delayed, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #18 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, November 23. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 23 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #17? 
          




Episode #17 was an utter spectacle in the best way possible. After being cornered by Haruta, Megumi resorted to summoning the ultimate Shikigami of his Ten Shadows technique Makora. To save Fushiguro&#39;s life, Sukuna engaged the Shikigami in combat, and their ensuing battle demolished much of the Shibuya district. When the fight ended, Sukuna was victorious but he had to give control of his body back to Yuji. Upon regaining control and realizing all the people Sukuna had killed using his body, Yuji was devastated. The episode ended with a half-burned Nanami ominously walking down a hallway.



 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #18 Will Focus on Nanami 
          

After being set on fire by Jogo it initially seemed like Nanami was dead a couple of episodes ago. But given the end of episode #17, Nanami looks to still be alive even if he seems in a pretty bad state. While his body is half burned, reverse cursed energy would be able to fix that, which means if Nanami can reach Shoko before he dies, he could reenter the fight against the Curses. He could also potentially awaken a reverse cursed energy technique like Gojo did after Toji beat him and become an even more powerful sorcerer.




Whatever happens in the next episode, hopefully, the problems behind the scenes at MAPPA resolve in a way that is best for the animators who have brought the fans some of the best episodes of anime of the year. This may manifest in a delay to the series or slightly worse animation but either way, there will probably continue to be uncertainty surrounding the rest of the season until it concludes. Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #18 will likely serve as an indicator of what the rest of the Shibuya Incident arc will look like given the turmoil behind the scenes.

Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #18 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 23, 2023.
