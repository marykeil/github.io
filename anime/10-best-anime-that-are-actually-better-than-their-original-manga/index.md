## Literature Review

While very few anime adaptations actually manage to significantly improve on their manga source material, these 10 series manage to do just that.




When creating an adaptation it is incredibly difficult to surpass the greatness of the original work, however, some anime better than their manga source material. While the high quality of these anime doesn&#39;t detract from the greatness of the original manga that inspired them, they are often recommended as the ideal way to experience the story. The exact reason for this can vary from series to series, however.
Sometimes a production team that is incredibly passionate about a series pours so much heart and soul into the animation that it goes above and beyond just translating the events of the manga into a different form. Sometimes the other parts of the show like the voice acting or score can heighten the emotions of a series. In rare cases, an anime can even change problematic aspects of its source material. Of course, this list will only be concerned with those instances when it is universally agreed that the changes were an improvement (so for instance the original Fullmetal Alchemist isn&#39;t on this list despite having some ardent supporters). Here are the ten best anime that are actually better than their original manga.









 








 10  The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. 
        

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. is a perfect anime adaptation of the manga. The series is a comedy following the incredibly powerful psychic Saiki as he attempts to live a quiet life despite his absurd group of friends. The anime doesn&#39;t really add anything to the manga&#39;s plot like some other shows later on this list will, but the animation and voice acting for the show is absolutely impeccable. The increasingly rapid line delivery in the second season especially enhances the hilarity of the series&#39; already great jokes. The only reason why it isn&#39;t higher on this list is because the anime doesn&#39;t drastically change the already great source material.





 9  Hunter x Hunter 
        

Hunter x Hunter is one of the best Shonen manga of all time, but unfortunately due to its creator&#39;s health problems, it has occasionally featured unfinished or rushed art. Of course in the volume releases this is often fixed, but this flaw of the manga is something that the 2011 anime was able to avoid given the entire story it was adapting was already complete. This does mean the anime&#39;s story isn&#39;t technically complete, but it ended on such a satisfying note that fans can be satisfied even if it never returns to adapt the following Succession War arc. In some ways this can also be seen as a positive, as while the Succession War has been incredible so far, the long hiatuses interrupting it have tormented many readers, and anime-only fans don&#39;t have to worry about that.





 8  Gintama 
        

Gintama is one of the best comedy anime of all time. Following the adventures of Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura as they do odd jobs around Edo it can be both gut-bustingly hilarious and incredibly tragic from one moment to the next. The manga also captures this incredibly well, but the anime adds some jokes and elements that make it a bit better. These can be simple anime original jokes or filler sections or as elaborate as a completely new opening. The voice acting also brings these characters to life in a way that elevates them even further from their manga counterparts. Despite its length, almost every episode of the series is great, and it is worth watching for fans who want to see one of anime&#39;s best hidden gems.





 7  Made in Abyss 
        

The Made in Abyss manga and anime actually have a pretty different art style, which makes comparing them somewhat difficult. Both versions of the series are utterly gorgeous and serve to make its moments of horror even more disturbing. However, the main reason the anime is better than the manga is it censors some of the more uncomfortable displays of nudity found in the original comic. While this isn&#39;t a major deal for every fan, many viewers feel this fanservice is unnecessarily exploitative and is thus uncomfortable to read. Besides this, the anime also has an incredible soundtrack that elevates many of the show&#39;s most emotional moments.





 6  Usagi Drop 
        

While Usagi Drop isn&#39;t necessarily as good as some of the series lower on this list, it ranks this high because of how much better the anime is than the manga. Usagi Drop starts as a wholesome story of a middle-aged man and his adoptive daughter. While this sort of slice-of-life plot isn&#39;t for everyone, it is adorable and relaxing to see the two grow closer together and become a true family. The anime preserves this feeling all the way through and ends on a sweet note. This is a major change from the manga, which has the relationship between these two characters turn romantic at the end of the series, rightfully disgusting many fans and making everything that preceded it feel creepy. Anyone wanting to experience this fun series should only watch the anime.





 5  Nichijou 
        

Nichijou is a hilarious slice-of-life comedy following the adventurers of various wacky characters as they navigate high school. Many of the best jokes from the manga are faithfully captured by the anime, but what makes the anime special is how far it takes them. For instance, in a scene where one girl Miu chases after someone who has a journal with a drawing she doesn&#39;t want them to see, the pursuit becomes so intense that the animation breaks down impressively and hilariously. This isn&#39;t a one-off occurrence of extra effort added to make a joke as powerful as possible, which makes the anime far superior to its already great manga counterpart.





 4  Demon Slayer 
        

Demon Slayer is one of the most popular manga of recent years, even surpassing One Piece in sales at one point. However, this popularity is largely due to its incredible anime adaptation. The anime didn&#39;t change the series in any major way, it just animated it incredibly well. This makes every fight much more of a spectacle than it was in the manga, which elevated the series above the relatively standard story it was in its original form. Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean Demon Slayer&#39;s original manga was bad, it just means that Ufotable&#39;s gorgeous adaptation is the better way to experience Tanjiro&#39;s journey to help his sister and all the demon battles that happen along the way.





 3  Bocchi the Rock! 
        

Bocchi the Rock! was a breakout hit of 2022 for good reason. The anime perfectly captured its protagonist&#39;s feelings of anxiety with its innovative use of various animation techniques and visual metaphors. In doing so it made the anime&#39;s jokes even funnier than the manga&#39;s and it somehow made Bocchi even more relatable. In addition, the anime actually released real music for Bocchi&#39;s band and it was so good its album topped the charts. Both of these elements in conjunction used the medium of animation to improve the overall experience in a way the manga physically couldn&#39;t, which makes the anime vastly superior.





 2  Ranking of Kings 
        

The original art style of the Ranking of Kings is simplistic, almost childishly so. This isn&#39;t a bad thing, as it fits the refreshingly innocent personality of its protagonist Bojji quite well. Perhaps this is part of why the anime adaptation of the series also adapted this art style. However, while this simple art could look ugly or awkward at times in the original manga, every frame of The Ranking of Kings anime looks beautiful. This isn&#39;t even mentioning the fight scenes, which the anime turns into some of the most gorgeous battles in all anime. Given the vast gulf in quality between the anime and manga&#39;s art, the anime is the version of the story that fans should consume.





 1  Mob Psycho 100 
        

One is a genius storyteller, but his manga art leaves a lot to be desired. It often looks like scribbles rather than a finished work. However, Bones took this art style and masterfully incorporated it into its adaptation of Mob Psycho 100. What was messy in the manga became chaotically dynamic in the anime, allowing for a wider range of expressions and movements. This was especially beneficial in fights, where the simple and malleable character designs allowed the animators to craft battles that were consistently incredible to watch. This combined with a great cast and soundtrack caused the anime to easily surpass the already stellar manga and become a modern classic.
When a team knows how to utilize the full power of the medium of animation in an adaptation, special shows like the ones in this list can be created. However, these shows are few and far between as most adaptations just directly translate what is on the page to the screen in a lackluster fashion. That makes the existence of these best anime adaptations that are better than their manga even more special.
