## Literature Review

With Wano&#39;s evil tyrants deposed, One Piece episode #1079 can now focus on what the Straw Hats are doing in the aftermath of the raid.





 What Time One Piece Episode #1079 Releases 
          




One Piece episode #1079, titled &#34;The Morning Arrives! Luffy and Everyone&#39;s Relaxation!&#34; will air on Sunday, October 15 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 14 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, September 17 at 3:00 a.m. British Summer Time (BST) for One Piece fans in the UK. Fans of the English dub will have to wait for that version to premiere on Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Episode #1078 of One Piece? 
          

The major plot development of episode #1078 is Momonosuke and the Scabbards revealing themselves to the people of Wano. Momonosuke&#39;s adult form was also revealed in that moment, showing that he is the spitting image of his father Oden. This allows the people of Wano to more readily accept him as their new shogun in the wake of Kaido and Orochi&#39;s defeat. As if Momo accepting the shogunship wasn&#39;t emotional enough, the episode also features Tama&#39;s tragic backstory, showing her being orphaned and then starving until Tenguyama found her. The episode ends with Yamato asking the Straw Hats if they can join their crew, which is a much less intense cliffhanger than other recent episodes had.






 One Piece Episode #1079 Will Show the Straw Hats Relaxing 
          

Based on the title of episode #1079, it will likely show the Straw Hats taking a well-deserved break after all the intense fighting they had to do in the Raid on Onigashima. The increased focus on the Straw Hats will be a welcome change for fans as well, who haven&#39;t had a chance to see the Straw Hats all interact together in a peaceful setting for years. Episode #1079 will likely also show Luffy making a decision on whether Yamato will join the crew, which is a question many fans have been asking since their first introduction.

Often amidst the celebration of an arc&#39;s conclusion, One Piece will slip in important information about the world at large. This can include the crew&#39;s new bounties but in this case, it will likely also focus on showing how various figures will react to Luffy defeating Kaido. This means that even though Wano&#39;s battles may be over, One Piece episode #1079 and beyond will be incredibly exciting for fans already looking forward to seeing the series set up the new status quo going forward.




Catch One Piece episode #1079 when it releases on Crunchyroll on October 14, 2023.
