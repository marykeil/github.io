# 10 Best Manga That Are Actually Better Than Their Anime Adaptation


## SUMMARY 


 Some anime adaptations fail to live up to the quality of the manga they are based on, making it better for fans to stick with the original source material.

## Literature Review

While manga readers will claim that the source material is better for any anime no matter how good it is, in these cases, they are definitely right.




While some anime can make major improvements over their source material, many don&#39;t live up to the quality of the manga they are based on. Most of the time this isn&#39;t much of an issue, but some anime do such a disastrous job adapting the manga they&#39;re based on that it can scar fans forever after. Even shows that aren&#39;t catastrophic failures can pale in comparison to the original work, making the manga the definitive best way to experience the story.
This can be an issue with an adaptation of any kind. Many stories are told in a way that takes full advantage of their original medium in a way that an animated television show can&#39;t quite capture. Even manga, which is generally one of the easier sources to adapt given its pages provide a potential ready-made template to base storyboards on can have elements that are quite difficult to adapt. Failing to bring those aspects to the screen is where many of these adaptations stumble, but there can occasionally be other issues such as poor budget and tight deadlines. These are the ten manga whose anime adaptations weren&#39;t quite up to par for one of those reasons or another.









 








 10  One-Punch Man 
        

The first season of One-Punch Man is one of the best anime adaptations of all time. Studio Madhouse assembled an all-star team of animators to make a series that lived up to the incredible detail of Yusuke Murata&#39;s art in the manga version of One&#39;s iconic webcomic. After a long hiatus, Season 2 was done by a different studio J.C. Staff, and unfortunately, it didn&#39;t live up to the high standard of the first season or the dynamic and awesome art of the manga. This makes it better for One-Punch Man fans to stick with the manga after season 1, as it is much better than the anime&#39;s version.





 9  One Piece 
        

One Piece is an interesting case as its anime isn&#39;t actually bad on the whole. In fact, it has hooked legions of fans on the series and has done justice to many of the manga&#39;s best moments. However, in order to avoid catching up to Eiichiro Oda&#39;s ongoing manga, it has had to slow its pace to a crawl, regularly adapting only one chapter per episode. While this can lead to greatness such as with the Zoro vs King fight in Wano, it often also makes the show feel like it is wasting time and dragging the plot to a standstill. Combined with the high quality of its source material, this makes One Piece a series that is better to read than to watch in general.





 8  Berserk 
        

Berserk had a beloved anime adaptation in the 90s that got many fans into the dark and gritty fantasy manga by Kentaro Miura. It then had a series of pretty good Berserk movies in the 2010s followed by a 2017 TV series that scarred fans with its poor quality. However, regardless of the individual quality of any of these adaptations, none have actually adapted any content beyond the Golden Age, which is one of Berserk&#39;s earliest arcs. While the Golden Age is superb, the content beyond it is arguably just as good making it a shame that there has never been a fuller adaptation of the series. If Berserk fans want to know what happens to Guts after the anime ends, they need to pick up the manga.





 7  Soul Eater 
        

Soul Eater was a pretty good show for most of its run. Set in a gothic world and centered on a group of soul hunters who were soul-bound to their weapons the story was incredibly enjoyable and charming. It was also a great adaptation of the manga by Atsushi Ohkubo up until its ending. The show created an ending unique to the anime that many fans were incredibly unhappy with, as it was much less satisfying than the manga&#39;s version. While it is better than many of the other shows on this list, fans should still read the Soul Eater manga over watching the anime.





 6  Junji Ito Collection 
        

Junji Ito is one of the premier horror mangaka, known for his iconic and disturbing stories that have terrified fans the world over. Thus the prospect of an anime adapting his work initially sounds very exciting. However, the finished product sapped much of the terror out of these tales, leaving many viewers underwhelmed. This isn&#39;t necessarily the fault of the anime studio behind the project, but more a consequence of Ito&#39;s mastery of the manga medium. Many of his stories are so terrifying because of the static and incredibly detailed art that an anime may find hard to replicate. Thus, Ito&#39;s works are best read in manga form rather than watched.





 5  The Seven Deadly Sins 
        

This fantasy series started pretty good, with animation by A-1 Pictures, who also made such hits as Sword Art Online. The story follows Melodias and Elizabeth as they set out to reunite the seven powerful warriors known as the Deadly Sins in order to fight a new evil. For a couple of seasons, the show was a perfectly serviceable adaptation of Nakaba Suzuki&#39;s manga but everything changed when A-1 Pictures stepped away from the project. The replacement studio Studio Deen didn&#39;t devote nearly as many resources to the show as the previous studio did, resulting in a show that looks like a stilted mess, with fights that look almost like PowerPoint presentations at worst. Given how unwatchable these later episodes are, fans should stick to the manga.





 4  Tokyo Ghoul 
        

Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s first season is incredibly good and illustrates why so many manga readers fell in love with Sui Ishida&#39;s thrilling work. The series follows a newly created Ghoul Kaneki as he struggles to adapt to the dark and violent conflicts between humans and ghouls. While the first season of the anime captured the beginning of Kaneki&#39;s journey nearly perfectly, the second season took the plot in a direction completely unique to the anime, which annoyed many fans who rightfully felt that the manga&#39;s plot was superior. Thus fans who want to experience the better version of the story should read Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s manga.





 3  The Promised Neverland 
        

The Promised Neverland fell into a similar problem as Tokyo Ghoul. After an incredible first season that adapted Kaiu Shirai and Posuka Demizu&#39;s original manga nearly perfectly, the second series dragged the series completely off the rails with an anime original story. The reason why The Promised Neverland is slightly more controversial than Tokyo Ghoul is that the second season actually implied that it was adapting a popular arc of the manga before completely pivoting away from it into something much worse. While some fans still have complaints about the manga&#39;s ending, it is still the much better version of The Promised Neverland&#39;s story.





 2  Record of Ragnarok 
        

The Record of Ragnarok manga is basically entirely made up of incredibly hype fights. The story centers around a contest between the gods and some of humanity&#39;s most powerful fighters. The art in the manga is incredibly detailed and epic, which makes each fight a spectacle like no other. Unfortunately, this art is where the anime stumbles. While it faithfully recreates the characters&#39; designs, the animation itself is very stiff, making many of the fights feel like slide shows more than the fluid and dynamic battles they should be. Thus, fans are better off checking out Shinya Umemura, Takumi Fukui, and Azychika&#39;s excellent manga than sitting through the show.





 1  Ex-Arm 
        

Ex-Arm not only fails as a manga adaptation but also as a cartoon in general. The anime is based on Hi-Rock and Shinya Komi&#39;s manga about a cyberpunk world where the police must stop villains using digitized brains to commit crimes. However, none of that really matters as the animation is so distractingly bad that it makes the show a confusing mess. The studio behind it tried using an experimental technique to give it a unique look and while they technically succeeded, unfortunately, that style is uniquely bad. Fans who actually want to engage with Ex-Arm&#39;s story should read the manga as the only thing they&#39;ll likely get out of the anime is confusion.
In general, while an anime adaptation may be inferior to its manga counterpart, either way of engaging with the story can suffice. However, with these series in particular there is such a gulf in quality between the two that fans really should read the manga to get the ideal experience. Hopefully, these 10 anime for which it is better to read the manga provide an example of potential pitfalls for future adaptations to avoid.
