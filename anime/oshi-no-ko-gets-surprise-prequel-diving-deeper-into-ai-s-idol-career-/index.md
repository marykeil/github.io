## Literature Review

Despite Ai Hoshino&#39;s limited appearance in Oshi no Ko, she is a popular character and fans will learn more about her past in an upcoming prequel.





Famous for its colorful designs and unveiling the reality of the brutal entertainment industry, Oshi no Ko recently announced that it would be receiving a second season. While fans will have to wait for updates on the continuation of the anime series, an exciting announcement was also made providing additional insight into Ai&#39;s idol career.





 

According to AniNewsAndFacts on X (formerly Twitter), Oshi no Ko will receive a light novel - Spica The First Evening Star - that will focus on Ai Hoshino, Aqua and Ruby&#39;s mother, before she became a wildly popular idol and actor. The novel will be released on November 17, 2023, and it will also reveal how Sarina and Goro, Ruby and Aqua in their past lives, met.

                  Oshi No Ko Season 2 Story, Latest News, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   Oshi no Ko was one of the biggest anime of spring 2023, and it&#39;s been officially greenlit for season 2. Here&#39;s all the latest information about it.   


 Ai From Oshi no Ko Deserves Her Own Story 
          




The hour-long first episode of Oshi No Ko showed fans just how amazing Ai Hoshino is. She was an incredibly talented musician, actor, and idol and an even better mother. Although she was not the main character, she stole the spotlight and her ultimate demise left viewers shocked. The upcoming light novel will go deeper into the character and will also offer a backstory into the fateful encounter of the bedridden Sarina and the kind doctor Goro, which should make for a heart-breaking side story given that fans know how it ends.

Titled Spica The First Evening Star, the Oshi No Ko spin-off light novel will be released on November 17, alongside another light novel for Kaguya-sama Love Is War. It will be written by Hajime Tanaka, and will include a story by the creator of the original series Aka Akasaka. The light novel will be about Ai deciding to leave B-Komachi before she became a star. Because of friction with the other members, she goes to the head of the agency to declare her resignation, but he makes a deal with her to stay. The synopsis given by Shueisha is as follows:





&#34;...I&#39;ve decided. I&#39;m no longer an idol.&#34;
One day, a while after joining B Komachi, Ai told the agency&#39;s president, Ichigo Saito. Behind the scenes of B Komachi&#39;s seemingly successful activities, there was a problem of discord between Ai, who served as the center, and the other members. Ai, fed up with this situation, tries to quit being an idol, but Ichigo makes a proposal to her...! ? In addition, the untold story of Sarina and Goro&#39;s encounter and farewell before they were reincarnated as Aqua and Ruby has been revealed!
In addition, the original novel written by Aka Akasaka was distributed as a bonus to attendees at the advance screening of the first episode of the anime. A super luxurious first novel version that also includes “Viewpoint B”!!


          




Ai Hoshino is too good of a character not to receive her own story. Her life is exciting, and there are many things to discuss: her rise to glory, and how she became a mother at such a young age. Although these questions will be answered as the series goes on and Ruby gets closer to the truth, Ai Hoshino deserves to be the main character, and she is finally getting the chance to. The light novel promises to keep fans entertained as they wait for more information on Oshi No Ko season 2.
