 10  Murim Login (2020) 
Based on the Web Novel by Zero-BIG &amp; Illustrated by Cheol-byeok Jang
        

When otherworldly gates suddenly show up, allowing dangerous monsters to roam freely in the human world, everyone fears for the worst. After finally defeating the demon king, awakened humans continue to fight, not to protect their world, but for wealth and fame, using their special powers to enter the gates and hunt monsters. As a hunter of the lowest class, Jin Tae-Kyung struggles to live a decent life, but everything changes when he comes across a mysterious VR machine that traps him in the world of a martial arts game.
Murim Login&#39;s comedy primarily stems from its unusual protagonist, whose choices often lead to unexpected situations. While most protagonists of similar stories are veterans of the games they play, Tae-Kyung is completely unfamiliar with his environment, which constantly surprises him, resulting in amusing reactions and exaggerated expressions. Rather than focusing on intelligence, as others would, he prefers a brute-strength approach, making him a simple yet endearing character, whose kindness and directness are sure to appeal to readers.





 9  Miss Not-So Sidekick (2017) 
Based on the Web Novel by Ellianyang &amp; Illustrated by YumYum


 







To Kim Hye-Jung, a hard-working teacher, the fantasy romance novel The Flower of the Beast is a source of comfort, helping her escape her daily stress. But when she falls asleep only to wake up as a character in the novel, she doesn&#39;t take the place of the beloved heroine, but rather that of Latte Ectrie, a minor antagonist fated to live a comfortable, yet uneventful life. Upon trying and failing to meaningfully connect with the three male leads, she decides to devote her time to another one of her passions, writing boys&#39; love stories - a choice that completely changes her own story.
Miss Not-So Sidekick takes a common isekai premise and puts a comedic twist on it, following a self-aware and refreshing protagonist who handles tropes realistically, rather than simply retreading old ground. While its unique art style may take some time to adapt to for some readers, the comedic scenes and well-developed characters, as well as the slow yet compelling romance that takes place between them, make this title worthwhile for any fan of the romance manhwa genre.
The creator of the Miss Not-So Sidekick web novel also authored several similar titles that received equally enjoyable manhwa adaptations, including A Royal Princess with Black Hair and Seducing the Monster Duke.

 8  Return of the Mad Demon (2021) 
Based on the Web Novel by Jin-Seong Yu, Written by JP, &amp; Illustrated by Hi Lee
        

Ja-Ha Lee, also known as the titular Mad Demon, is a powerful yet unpredictable man who would go to any lengths to become the God of Martial Arts, even as far as stealing the Jade of Heaven, despite being unprepared to fight off the entire Demon Cult for it. When he falls off a cliff to his imminent death, he is given a second chance at life, as he finds himself regressed to his younger self. Determined to avoid his past mistakes, Ja-Ha sets out to fulfill his dream.
Although comedy may not necessarily be the emphasis of this title, Return of the Mad Demon doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously, resulting in plenty of witty dialogue and chaotic developments. Moreover, the art style perfectly complements the humor as well, adding to the absurdity caused by the protagonist whenever he does or says unexpected things.
The Return of the Mad Demon web novel&#39;s creator also authored A Dance of Swords in the Night, which, while not nearly as highly regarded, should still be interesting to fans of action/comedy titles.

 7  FFF-Class Trashero (2019) 
Based on the Web Novel by Farnar, Written &amp; Illustrated by Kkangmu
        

Han-Soo Kang was an ordinary boy who was suddenly summoned to Fantasia and named the Chosen Hero, fated to defeat the Demon Lord and save the world. After 10 years of training and fighting, he finally fulfills his mission, only to be met with a shocking revelation. The &#34;god&#34; of Fantasia had been watching him all along, investigating his actions throughout his journey. According to his final report card, his immoral decisions caused his failure as a hero, resulting in him being sent into the past and having to do everything all over again, under the strict watch of an instructor.
Living up to its title, FFF-Class Trashero stands out thanks to its unique hero, whose attitude and behavior do not match his role whatsoever. Constantly subverting expectations, Han-Soo does not hesitate to display his lack of compassion and empathy, prioritizing his well-being above all else. Moreover, he is also shown not to care for generic tropes, as he expresses his frustration with certain recurring events in such stories. The art style matches the lighthearted tone of the story as well, with exaggerated expressions depicting equally ridiculous statements.

 6  Touch My Little Brother and You&#39;re Dead (2021) 
Based on the Light Novel by Molpo, Written by Cheolmujangmi, &amp; Illustrated by Web Jaktunga
        

In the boys&#39; love novel “Asterion of the Twilight”, the titular Asterion is a tragic character, fated to die at the age of 20 after struggling with depression.

But when she realizes that his death causes her to return to the beginning of the story, Rosalite resolves to keep him alive, only to be met with increasingly more unexpected deaths and setbacks.
While stories depicting repeated time loops aren&#39;t entirely uncommon, Touch My Little Brother and You&#39;re Dead is particularly noteworthy for its unhinged protagonist, who has truly had enough of having to re-live her life. After numerous failed attempts at peacefully and diplomatically protecting her brother, Rosalite decides to simply take out any potential threat to Rion&#39;s life, refusing to listen to anyone else. Her behavior and attitude are always comical, matching the absurdity of her situation.

 5  Maybe Meant to Be (2022) 
Original Series Written by Kkultarae &amp; Illustrated by Damcho
        

Jia Han is a 32-year-old, out-of-work freelancer, whose parents and family keep passive-aggressively asking her to get married and move out. After coming across Mincheol Jin, an old childhood friend, by chance, and venting to him about her situation, she learns that he too is facing similar pressure from his family, despite living an otherwise decent life and having a respectable career. After randomly suggesting that getting married would solve both of their troubles, Jia suddenly finds herself sharing her life with the blunt yet lovable Mincheol.
While this genre may not suit everyone&#39;s preferences, rom-coms are easy to like, and Maybe Meant to Be is no exception. Revolving around the unexpected and occasionally awkward romance of two flawed but realistic characters, this title provides a genuinely wholesome experience elevated by a plethora of amusing scenes. While some of the other characters are not as well-liked, the main couple&#39;s humorous dynamic is captivating, and only further augmented by the appropriately delightful art style.

 4  Return of the Blossoming Blade (2021) 
Based on the Web Novel by Bi-Ga, Written &amp; Illustrated by LICO


 







Once a formidable swordsman of the Mount Hua Sect, the &#34;Plum Blossom Sword Saint&#34; Cheong-Myeong managed to defeat the evil Cheon-Ma of the Demonic Cult, only to succumb to his wounds shortly after.

Disappointed with the declining state of his beloved Mount Hua Sect, the ever-loyal and passionate Cheong-Myeong sets out to restore it, showcasing the techniques he learned in his previous life in the process.
Though this may not be a comedy title first and foremost, Return of the Blossoming Blade proves to be hilarious nonetheless, thanks to its chaotic protagonist who shows little concern for anything beyond his own goals. Its straightforward story may not be particularly unique, but the way it blends engaging action scenes with surprisingly funny lighthearted ones makes it a truly outstanding title and one of the best reincarnation manhwa of all time.

 3  Eleceed (2018) 
Original Series Written by Jae-Ho Son &amp; Illustrated by Hye-Jin Kim
        

When Ji-Woo Seo picks up a seemingly ordinary stray cat, he makes a decision that is about to change his life without even realizing it. The cat turns out to be none other than Kayden Break, one of the strongest unaffiliated awakeners, who decides to become Ji-Woo&#39;s mentor and teach him about the Awakened World, a secret society for those with special abilities. Although the two may not see eye to eye all the time, Ji-Woo and Kayden have no choice but to unite their knowledge and powers, should they seek to defeat evil and protect the world.
Although it may not always be labeled as such, Eleceed is as much a comedy title as it is an action one, and it undoubtedly excels in both departments. The unusual situation of the awkward protagonist duo naturally lends itself to comedic scenes, which are numerous and well executed. Of course, the other characters are equally interesting, and their interactions never fail to entertain. As such, thanks to its brilliant story, characters, and artwork, this title proves to be worthwhile not only for fans of action manhwa, but also for those with a penchant for comedy.
The author behind Eleceed&#39;s story also wrote Noblesse, which likewise blends engaging action scenes with lighthearted comedy.

 2  Beware the Villainess! (2020) 
Based on the Web Novel by Ppongttamatseukeuryuba, Written by Yeolmae, &amp; Illustrated by Blue Canna


 







To a modern-day college student, a lethal car accident ironically proves to be her escape, as she awakens as the villainess of a novel, Melissa Podebrat. As the daughter of the duke, Melissa&#39;s life is a pleasant one, surrounded by wealth and comfort, which is a perfect respite for her given how exhausted she was in her past life. However, due to her role as the villainess, she is also fated to suffer at the hands of the novel&#39;s male leads, who constantly take advantage of her loyal and hopeful nature. With no reason to put up with any of this, Melissa sets out to live life as she sees fit.
While villainess titles are surprisingly common in this medium, Beware the Villainess! is a truly one-of-a-kind comedic story. Here, the protagonist seeks neither to make amends for her past deeds, nor to become a kind heroine loved by all. Instead, Melissa refuses to conform to any nobility standards, and will not hesitate to call out anything she perceives as incorrect, even when it comes to the supposedly perfect male leads of the novel. She chases her goals bluntly, even resorting to violence if needed, and continuously creates amusing scenes with her wits and personality.

 1  The Greatest Estate Developer (2021) 
Based on the Web Novel by Baek-Gyeong Mun, Written by Hyeon-Min Lee, &amp; Illustrated by Hyeon-Su Kim
        

Su-Ho Kim, an ordinary civil engineering student, falls asleep while reading a fantasy novel, only to wake up in the body of Lloyd Frontera. Unfortunately, Lloyd&#39;s fate in the novel is far from a fortunate one, as he is doomed by his own alcoholism and cruel, selfish personality. In order to escape the great debt threatening the existence of his family, Lloyd decides to leverage his engineering knowledge while maintaining his selfish reputation to develop properties and new inventions and improve his future.
While its premise may seem generic at first, The Greatest Estate Developer is sure to impress readers with its absurd comedy and exaggerated comical expressions. This title does not take itself seriously at all, which is evident both in the story and the art style. Not only is the protagonist compelling, as he shamelessly resorts to any method to achieve his goals, but the interactions between the other characters are also equally entertaining. All in all, this outstanding title is not only one of the best ongoing manhwa of 2023, but also one of the best comedy manhwa of all time.
