# Pokémon Horizons Reveals Liko s Incredible Heritage


## SUMMARY 



  Lucius, the Ancient Adventurer, shares a strong family resemblance with Liko and her ancestors, suggesting Liko is a direct descendant of his.   The discovery of Lucius&#39;s journal and pendant in Liko&#39;s Grandmother&#39;s attic raises questions about what happened to him after finding Rakua, the paradise where he promised to reunite with his Pokémon.   Liko&#39;s connection to Lucius leads her on a journey to gather his Pokémon and fulfill his promise, leaving the possibility open for Lucius to still be waiting in Rakua.

## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons revealed the full appearance of the Ancient Adventurer Lucius, and his resemblance to Liko and her family seems more than incidental.




Warning: Spoilers for Pokémon Horizons Episode #32Pokémon Horizons has finally revealed the full appearance of the Ancient Adventurer Lucius, hailed as one of the strongest trainers in history, and he bears a distinctive resemblance to Liko and her family. In fact, the evidence seems to be pointing to the idea that Liko is a direct descendant of Lucius, which has some interesting implications for the story.




Liko only learned about the Ancient Adventurer not too long ago, found in a storybook written by her father that was loosely based on a story he had heard. This storybook adventure has turned out to be real, however, and the Ancient Poké Balls and the Pendant are closely tied to this impressive historical figure. Liko&#39;s mother pointed her and the Rising Volt Tacklers towards her own mother (Liko&#39;s grandmother), who was residing in a castle in Galar and was once an adventurer herself.

          

Liko&#39;s grandmother, Diana, had plenty of new information to reveal about the Ancient Adventurer, as she was the one who originally discovered his journal and pendant.


 Is Liko Descended from the Ancient Adventurer, Lucius? 
          




When Lucius is shown in a memory shared by Terapagos, his hair has the same shade of blue that Liko, her mother, and her grandmother all share, as well as the cowlick in their hair, which all three also have. This family resemblance strongly suggests that Liko is a descendant of Lucius on her mother&#39;s side. Additionally, when Diana recounted finding the Ancient Adventurer&#39;s pendant and journal, she noted that it was upstairs in the attic of the house she grew up in. If Lucius is related to Liko&#39;s family, however, it raises a lot of questions about exactly what happened to him at the end of his journey.

In the memory itself, Lucius promises his Pokémon that he will see them again in Rakua, the paradise that he is said to have found in the legend of the Ancient Adventurer. That would suggest that Lucius intended to stay there, so how did he end up having descendants in the outside world? Perhaps they discovered Rakua and had to leave it for some reason, with Lucius promising they would all reunite there one day. Alternatively, it might be that Lucius already had a child before leaving on his adventure, and that child was left in the care of its mother after he left. In that case, however, how would his journal and the pendant have been returned to the mother?






 Pokémon Horizons&#39; New Protagonist Has Big Shoes To Fill 
          

Between the resemblance, the pendant, and the journal that Diana has, it seems all but confirmed that Liko has some familial connection to Lucius. In that sense, gathering Lucius&#39; Pokémon and leading them back to Rakua has her fulfilling her ancestor&#39;s promise all these years later. That relationship raises plenty of new questions about Lucius, however, which may be difficult to answer. It also gives a whole new aura of mystique to Liko, who could be a descendant of the strongest trainer in history. Only future episodes of Pokémon Horizons will tell if she will live up to these high expectations.
