## Literature Review

A conversation during the Tournament of Destroyers could be a clue as to why Black Frieza spared Goku and Vegeta in Dragon Ball Super.





In Dragon Ball Super chapter #12 by story writer Akira Toriyama and artist Toyotarou, Universe 6&#39;s Angel Vados informs his God of Destruction Champa that he had actually succeeded in getting Hit to join the tournament against Goku&#39;s Universe 7 by promising him the Cube Spaceship. Readers learned the prospective ramifications of this when Champa voiced his disapproval, explaining that Hit could use the Cube Spaceship to travel anywhere, including any of the 12 universes.




          

After his fight with Goku, however, Hit decided not to cash in on his prize, so nothing ever came of Vados&#39; presumptuous promise. Regardless, this incredibly powerful vehicle could prove to be a lot more important than fans thought. In fact, it&#39;s possible that Frieza could be after the Cube Spaceship to travel to a specific universe outside his own, to enact the most twisted form of revenge against the Saiyans.


 Frieza Could Use the Cube Spaceship to Conquer the Saiyans Once Again 
          

After participating in the Tournament of Power, Frieza is now aware there are Saiyans in Universe 6. It&#39;s plausible that Frieza is planning to use the Cube Spaceship to travel to Universe 6 and conquer the Saiyan race there to force them to serve him like he originally did with the Saiyans of Universe 7. This would undoubtedly be the ultimate revenge against Goku and Vegeta, who are responsible for crushing Frieza&#39;s galactic empire and humiliating him several times. Rather than kill them like he could have done when he first appeared in his Black form, Frieza could enslave their people in a completely different universe and then force the Universe 6 Saiyans to invade Universe 7.




Since Black Frieza was able to easily overpower Goku and Vegeta on planet Cereal, Black Frieza should have nothing to fear when invading Universe 6. Based on his battle against Jiren, Hit is likely weaker than Goku now, and Frieza&#39;s Universe 6 counterpart Frost hasn&#39;t even unlocked the Gold form. The only real threat to Frieza is possibly the Legendary Super Saiyan Kale, but Black Frieza could even be more than a match for her since readers still haven&#39;t seen him fight seriously.



 How Does Frieza Know About the Cube Spaceship? 
          

Unfortunately, there are still a few holes in this theory. The only time Universe 7 traveled by Cube Spaceship was to get to the nameless planet for the Tournament of Destroyers. Frieza wasn&#39;t present during that tournament; he joined during the Tournament of Power, and on that occasion, each universe&#39;s angel transported their fighters to the Null Realm themselves instead of relying on a Cube Spaceship. However, there are a few ways Frieza could have learned about them. During the Tournament of Power, Frieza did temporarily align himself with Frost, who could have revealed the info off-panel. Additionally, Frieza&#39;s comments on how he stumbled upon the franchise&#39;s third Room of Spirit and Time suggest he was possibly searching for something on the planets he conquered.




So while Dragon Ball Super doesn&#39;t present any hard evidence that Frieza knows Cube Spaceships exist, he could also find other means to travel between universes. More importantly, Frieza sparing the two people he hates most in the universe, Goku and Vegeta, when he finally got the upper hand on them, doesn&#39;t make any sense, unless he&#39;s planning something way more devious, and forcing them to watch their tragic history repeat in front of their eyes would be the perfect revenge for Dragon Ball&#39;s most vicious villain.
