## Literature Review

From the ability to freeze enemies in place to the ability to steal quirks from others, here are some of the most powerful My Hero Academia quirks.





Some Quirks are quite threatening on their own, while others only really shine in conjunction with other Quirk users, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily make them worse. The best Quirks are those with some major versatility, applicable to a wide number of scenarios, not just those with immense amounts of power (although that&#39;s great, too). The true power of a Quirk resides in its user, as even a seemingly weak Quirk can be surprisingly dangerous in the right hands. One also needs to understand their Quirk well in order to make full use of its abilities, as that&#39;s what enables creative applications in the first place.









 








 25  Hardening - Eijiro Kirishima 
        

One of U.A.&#39;s Class 1-A students, Eijiro Kirishima features prominently in the My Hero Academia anime. His quirk, Hardening, allows him to morph his body into a near-unbreakable material and transforms his arms into sharp weapons. It may not be one of the class&#39; flashiest quirks, but it is proven to be devastating to enemies in battle. During his training with Pro Hero Fat Gum and once again during the Shie Hassaikai attack, Kirishima demonstrated his prowess in combat, going toe-to-toe with some of My Hero Academia&#39;s fiercest villains.





 24  Creation - Momo Yaoyorozu 
        

Momo&#39;s Quirk allows her to create essentially any object she understands the structure of out of her own body fats, with seemingly no limit as to what she can create. Her use of the Quirk has included everything from sedatives to actual cannons, making her the ultimate resource to have on a team. No matter what a hero might need, Momo can create it in an instant. Her only real weakness is that using the Quirk too much can leave her physically exhausted, as it consumes all the fat in her body, leaving none for her to use as fuel. This is one Quirk that, in the hands of anyone less brilliant, might not be quite so impressive.





 23  IQ - Saiko Intelli 
        

A Seiai Academy student, Saiko Intelli is a very minor character featured in the anime version of the Provisional Hero License Exam arc. Though she&#39;s eventually outwitted by a group of students led by Momo Yaoyorozu, she proves to be an excellent leader with an indispensable ability. Saiko&#39;s quirk, IQ, allows her to temporarily boost her intelligence when she drinks tea. Different types of tea impart differing effects on her mental faculties, and in the anime, she is seen drinking English High Tea, which seems to grant her advanced premonitory abilities.





 22  Dark Shadow - Fumikage Tokoyami 
        

Dark Shadow is the Quirk belonging to Tokoyami, and manifests as an evil spirit that&#39;s sealed to his body. Dark Shadow wields tremendous power and has something of a mind of its own, meaning it can attack without Tokoyami taking direct control. Tokoyami has also come up with some creative uses for it, such as using it to carry himself, effectively gaining the ability to fly. Dark Shadow gets stronger when in dimly lit environments, to the point where it can sometimes go out of control, especially early on in the series. With a clever choice of environment, Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow can become nearly unstoppable.





 21  Despot - Dictator 
        

Dictator is a minor villain from the Dark Hero arc who possesses the perfect Quirk for a villain: Despot. Despot allows Dictator to literally puppet other people by thin strings, and he&#39;s able to command dozens of people at once with it when he first encounters Deku. By taking control of innocent people, it was nearly impossible for Deku to fight back without hurting them, and the people he controls are fully aware they&#39;re being controlled, begging for help all the while. It was only thanks to Bakugo&#39;s timely arrival that the situation was stopped, attacking from his only undefended side: above.





 20  Transform - Himiko Toga 
        

Toga is able to transform herself into anyone just by getting her hands on a small amount of their blood, making her the ultimate at infiltration and disguise. This was proven most successfully at the Provisional Hero Licensing exams, when she impersonated Camie to get inside the test. Toga&#39;s Quirk has grown even more powerful, however, as now she&#39;s able to use the Quirks of those she transforms into--or at least, the Quirks of certain people whom she cares for deeply. That can make Toga unpredictable in battle, giving her an edge when going against heroes.





 19  Copy - Neito Monoma 
        

Neito Monoma has a unique Quirk: he has the ability to copy other Quirks. Thankfully, he can’t actually copy all Quirks, as he&#39;s beset by restrictions and limitations. Still, it can be an incredibly useful Quirk with a boundless amount of potential applications. However, even with limitations on what he can mimic, this ability is extremely useful. It allows Monoma to be fairly versatile in any given situation. He can even combat an enemy with their own Quirk, depending on what it is.





 18  Confession - Shin Nemoto 
        

A quirk wielded by Shie Hassaiki affiliate Shin Nemoto, Confession allows its user to draw out the truth from anyone after a question is asked. While it&#39;s not particularly useful in combat, it is of incredible importance to Overhaul during interrogations. Shin Nemoto was held in high esteem by the notoriously testy Overhaul, and he was a vital member of the villain&#39;s Eight Bullets inner circle. Regrettably, Shin Nemoto remained loyal to Overhaul to the last, an allegiance that landed him in prison following My Hero Academia&#39;s eventful Shie Hassaiki arc.





 17  Warp Gate - Kurogiri 
        

Though he&#39;s not all that powerful on his own, Kurogiri acts as an invaluable asset for Tomura Shigaraki and the League of Villains. Instrumental in their infiltration of the USJ in the first season of the anime, Kurogiri&#39;s quirk, warp gate, allows him to envelop friends and foes in a dense fog that can teleport them from place to place. Perfect as a means of transportation and as an easy way to escape from hazardous situations, Kurogiri has a major hand in allowing the League of Villains to remain so evasive. Though he&#39;s proven to be fallible during the USJ attack, he&#39;s an essential member of any villain crew.





 16  Erasure - Shota Aizawa 
        

U.A. professor Shota Aizawa may not be all that powerful in a conventional sense, but his quirk makes him incredibly valuable in combat. Wielding Erasure, Aizawa can temporarily deactivate a person&#39;s quirk, with the effect lasting for as long as he can keep his gaze fixed on them. Obviously, it comes with a few weaknesses; it doesn&#39;t last all that long, and it gives him dry eye. Still, we&#39;ve seen him use it to save lives in the past, and, though he won&#39;t be demolishing city blocks or pulverizing opponents, he&#39;s still more than capable of saving the day.





 15  Blood Curdle - Hero Killer: Stain 
        

Stain had what is quite possibly the most brutal combination of quirk and personality. His Quirk, Blood Curdle, gives him the ability to freeze anybody whose blood he ingests. His quirk is only effective in violent altercations, of course, and he then takes advantage of the person being frozen to maim or slaughter them. In the hands of a killer like Stain, this Quirk is incredibly powerful—and incredibly dangerous; the famous fight that pitted him against three U.A. students was indication enough of that fact. Furthermore, fans can only wonder how his Quirk might have been utilized had he become a hero.





 14  Heal - Recovery Girl 
        

Recovery Girl boasts the incredible ability to heal the wounds of those she kisses. She&#39;s a prominent part of U.A.&#39;s faculty, and, without her, the school wouldn&#39;t be able to concurrently conduct dangerous exercises with students. She&#39;s seen healing Izuku Midoriya on multiple occasions, but there are, unfortunately, limits to her abilities. Heal boosts the body&#39;s natural ability to recover, but its overuse could impart devastating effects. Still, her power is indispensable, and it&#39;s hard to know what U.A. plans to do once she can no longer perform her duties.





 13  Half-Cold Half-Hot - Shoto Todoroki 
        

Most of the elemental quirks seen in the anime seem like they would be useful depending on the situation. However, many of them are limited by their environments, as evidenced in the series. That’s what makes Todoroki’s quirk stand out among the rest. Shoto Todoroki can command both fire and ice, and it’s an extremely strong quirk. He was already a skilled fighter before entering U.A. as a result of his strict father. Todoroki is a versatile fighter thanks to his quirk, and he will become an even bigger threat as he gains more control over his quirk.





 12  Brainwashing - Hitoshi Shinso 
        

Shinso has a criminally undervalued quirk, but, based on the way they test for new students, it’s no surprise that Shinso failed. Yet, that shouldn&#39;t be an indication of the strength of his quirk; the ability to control minds is not one that should be underestimated, especially when he can mimic others’ voices and gain a higher chance of getting a response from his targets. Shinso played a minor role in the second season of the anime, but he&#39;s been a much larger part of the fifth season. His altercations with Deku have been some of the season&#39;s most interesting moments, and there&#39;s no denying that he wields an incredible power.





 11  Black Hole - Thirteen 
        

Thirteen is sort of an overlooked hero due to her focus on rescue instead of combat, but that doesn&#39;t mean she should be underestimated. The ability to create black holes is an incredible feat, and it makes Thirteen extremely dangerous in a fight. One can understand why Thirteen has dedicated the use of their quirk to rescue instead of harm. Her quirk can prove to be extremely dangerous, and there&#39;s a significant chance that she could kill her opponents, something heroes often try to avoid.





 10  Decay - Tomura Shigaraki 
        

Tomura Shigaraki has one of the more disturbing My Hero Academia quirks out there. Not only is it dangerous, but it’s painful, and, quite frankly, it just looks alarming. Shigaraki has the quirk of disintegration. We saw it get used against Aizawa in the first season. Shigaraki doesn’t seem terribly interested in using his quirk in excess. It may be that it&#39;s physically painful or draining, but it&#39;s more likely there are other reasons he doesn’t want to rely on the quirk.





 9  Foldabody - Edgeshot 
        

The current Number Four Pro Hero and highest-rated member of the group of heroes known as The Lurkers, Pro Hero Edgeshot boasts a strange quirk of which he makes incredible use. Known as Foldabody, he&#39;s able to transform his body into a razor-sharp and incredibly thin strand which he uses to slice through enemies and squeeze into tight spaces. While a deadly offensive tool, Foldabody is versatile and makes Edgeshot a valuable asset in all sorts of situations. He played a major role in the attack in Kamino Ward during the anime&#39;s third season.





 8  Explosion - Katsuki Bakugo 
        

Katsuki Bakugo, the longtime rival of series protagonist Izuku Midoriya, wields an incredibly devastating quirk known simply as Explosion. Able to ignite the nitroglycerin which he excretes from his hands, Bakguo can torch his enemies with ease, further developing his quirk to allow him to fly via controlled blasts.
Unfortunately, his immense power is counterbalanced by his equally hot temper. A hothead through and through, Bakugo isn&#39;t easy to get along with, and this hinders his ability to work as part of a team—some fans even suggest that Bakugo fits into the Tsundere character archetype. Nevertheless, he&#39;s an incredible fighter, and he possesses one of Class 1-A&#39;s most impactful quirks. Also, Izuku Midoriya&#39;s One For All was briefly transferred to Bakugo during the events of the Heroes Rising film.





 7  Manifest - Tamaki Amajiki 
        

It may not seem all that useful on paper, but Tamaki Amajiki&#39;s Manifest quirk can be incredibly powerful. Manifest allows Amajiki to change his appendages into those of animals he&#39;s eaten recently. With this, he&#39;s able to create tentacles and a massive shell to ensnare and attack his enemies. He can also sprout wings, giving him even more of an edge. Though he goes by the intimidating name of Suneater, he&#39;s brought down by his extreme lack of self-confidence. Still, he&#39;s been able to shake off multiple powerful attackers at once, and he&#39;s doubtlessly one of the anime&#39;s most powerful characters.





 6  Double - Twice 
        

Twice&#39;s Quirk allows him to create duplicates of himself and others, provided he has exact measurements of them. For much of My Hero Academia, Twice has had a psychological block that kept him from using the Quirk to its fullest, but he overcame that during the Meta Liberation Army arc, allowing him to create an endless wave of clones of himself. This was seen by the heroes as such a threat that they actually felt that he had to be killed, or else the villains would surely win. The ability to conjure an army in an instant is definitely a powerful one, so it&#39;s no wonder the heroes felt that such lengths were justified.
