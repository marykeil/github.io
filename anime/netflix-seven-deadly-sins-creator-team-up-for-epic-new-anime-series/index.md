## Literature Review

Netflix has announced it will be streaming Rising Impact, an upcoming adaptation of Nakaba Suzuki&#39;s golf manga that predates Seven Deadly Sins.




Streaming service Netflix has announced that it will stream the upcoming adaptation of Rising Impact. While the manga is written by Nakaba Suzuki of Seven Deadly Sins fame, the older manga is a sports story about golf. The anime will have two seasons, which will respectively premiere in June and August 2024




With Netflix already streaming both Seven Deadly Sins and its sequel Four Knights of the Apocalypse, it seems it wanted even more of the manga author&#39;s works, starting with his very first. Rising Impact is a far cry from his later works, but Lay-duce&#39;s art and growing interest in golf anime should garner attention.


 

Likewise, longtime fans of Seven Deadly Sins may be curious to see Suzuki&#39;s familiar fingerprints.


 Rising Impact Is A Glimpse To Suzuki And Anime&#39;s Past 
         

The Netflix teaser comes with a synopsis in its trailer, which describes Rising Impact like this:





The golf manga &#34;Rising Impact&#34; — the first serialized manga by Nakaba Suzuki, author of the mega-hit series &#34;The Seven Deadly Sins&#34; — began its run in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1998 and gained enthusiastic support from fans. And now, 25 years later, it is finally being adapted into an anime! Over the course of two seasons, this series follows the growth of third-grader Gawain Nanaumi as he encounters the sport of golf and competes with his rivals.


Animation will be handled by Lay-duce, a studio with a fairly consistent track record; their last anime was Tomo-chan Is a Girl!, which had a decent positive reception during the spring broadcast season. Attached to the project is director Hitoshi Nanba, who also helmed the Golden Kamuy anime, and Michihiro Tsuchiya as scriptwriter, best known for writing Bakuman&#39;s anime. Voice actors Misaki Kuno and Yumiri Hanamori are also on board to voice the characters Gawain and Lancelot. The high-quality animation in the teaser does seem to indicate that Netflix&#39;s support of the project is leading to better art than before.




                  Shonen Jump&#39;s New Series Brings A Much-Needed New Approach To Sports Manga   While golf is at the center of the new Shonen Jump series Green Green Greens, the early focus is on the characters and that&#39;s the best thing about it.   

While it is amusing to see the shift from golf to the fantasy world of Britannia, the change is understandable. Rising Impact&#39;s publication in Weekly Shonen Jump ran between 1998 and 2002, the decade where sports stories reined supreme, between the 90s juggernaut that was Slam Dunk! or Eyeshield 21, which began in 2002. It is no surprise Suzuki fell upon golf for his manga. But even with such a focus, Suzuki&#39;s signature elements can already be seen, with his propensity for Arthurian references and short, young protagonists - both of which appear yet again in Four Knights of the Apocalypse.

Netflix obviously wants to keep ahold of Suzuki&#39;s fans, hence its acquisition of Rising Impact. The anime seems angled towards letting Seven Deadly Sins fans see what the early days of the author were like, no matter how obscure the work has become or if its genre is completely different. That is not to say that anime viewers have absolutely no interest in golf. The 2022 original anime Birdie Wing: Golf Girls&#39; Story managed to snag a receptive audience with its antics, meaning Rising Impact certainly has viewers who are waiting next year for the next overly dramatic golf anime.
