## Literature Review

Anime has developed a problem with always trying to make villains sympathetic, but Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End has a perfect solution for that.





Anime, and fiction, in general, have a definite problem with trying to force gray morality, but Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, manages to fix that brilliantly through its villains.




          

Episode #7 was the proper introduction of the anime’s villains, the demon race, and they’re established as bloodthirsty monsters physically incapable of empathy or understanding any human emotions, meaning that the story never bothers with trying to make them sympathetic while also letting them do one terrible thing after another. That, in turn, also works to make them the perfect villains for the anime, and overall, it does wonders to fix what’s become such a persistent problem in all forms of fiction.

 Frieren Isn&#39;t Trying To Make Its Villains Sympathetic, And It Works 
          

Part of why the villains of Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End are great is that they’re designed to be incapable of sympathy. The episode states pretty clearly that demons are merely monsters who learned to imitate human language as a way to deceive their prey by appealing to humans&#39; compassion. That seems to be a reference to anime&#39;s tendency to make its villains sympathetic at any cost. Many anime will have their villains, or at least their antagonists, repeatedly do terrible things while showing little remorse for their actions, only to atone and then help the heroes in a critical moment. That has made the idea of any sort of redemption arc hard to buy, and it’s why so many stories fail to sell villains as sympathetic: they try too hard.

Another issue stems from how cliché it is to try and make every villain redeemable. While there’s nothing wrong with a story making its villains sympathetic, seeing it be attempted so many times across so many different mediums destroys the novelty of it, especially when the results are so often lacking. Naruto was infamous for trying to redeem all its villains, but since then this trope has become even more obnoxious. At this point, seeing a story not try and make its villains sympathetic and simply lean into their abject lack of humanity would be far fresher an idea, despite how &#34;old-school&#34; that kind of writing might come across as, and Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End does just that, adding even more charm to its story.



 Frieren’s Demons Are The Perfect Villains, Despite Their Lack Of Depth 
          




Frieren’s demons are incapable of being sympathetic because of their lack of human emotion, and that makes them the perfect villains for the series. The overarching theme of Frieren is the importance of embracing emotions and bonds with others, with Frieren’s character arc, specifically, being about her journey to be more in touch with the emotions of herself and others. As such, demons being biologically incapable of human emotion puts them in direct contrast to the overarching themes of the story, making them the best villains for Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, and that also works as great criticism of anime&#39;s tendency to force gray morality in their stories.

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End releases new episodes Fridays on Crunchyroll.
