Bloom Into You: A sweet and fun romance anime that explores same-gender relationships. The story is well-paced and satisfying.
Odd Taxi: An intriguing slice-of-life and crime anime with anthropomorphic characters. The mystery and eccentricity make it worth a watch.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Not every anime fan has time for huge series like Naruto or One Piece, but these short single-season anime outings should be seen by everyone.</p>
<p>The sheer length of some of the most famous anime series can be something of a turnoff for newcomers, leading some fans to wonder what the best short anime are. Friends may enthusiastically recommend Naruto, One Piece, or The Legend of Galactic Heroes, but those shows, classics that they are, have hundreds of episodes, making them something of a time commitment, to say the very least.
Maybe a viewer is new to anime and isn&rsquo;t sure that they want to sink that much time into a single piece of media, or maybe they&rsquo;re a longtime fan who simply doesn&rsquo;t have the time or patience to sit through another 70 episodes until they finally reach the story arc their friends keep raving about. Luckily for those pressed for time, anime has a lot of excellent shorter shows that aren&rsquo;t held back by their length, coming in at 13 episodes or less. The best short anime series don&rsquo;t waste time getting to the good stuff.</p>
<p>25 Most Underrated Anime Series
Some animes garner a lot of popularity but others tend to slip between the cracks. These are some underrated animes worth checking out.</p>
<p>25  Katanagatari (2010)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>Adapted from a light novel by Nisio Isin (of Bakemonogatari fame), Katanagatari tells the story of an ambitious woman and her somewhat dull-headed warrior guardian on a quest through Japan to collect 12 legendary blades. Featuring striking anime character designs, outstanding animation, and engaging dialogue; Katanagatari is not to be missed. One caveat is that while there are only a dozen episodes, each has a forty-five-minute runtime, meaning that Katanagatari will be a bit of a time-sink relative to other single-season anime series.</p>
<p>24  Bloom Into You (2018)
13 Episodes</p>
<p>The short anime series Bloom Into You follows teenager Yuu Koito as she goes through a period of self-discovery. She loves romance stories, but when a boy confesses his feelings for her, she doesn’t get the excitement she expects from it, and has to determine why. As she eventually discovers after asking another female student for help, that might be because she isn’t interested in boys at all. It’s rare for romance anime to center on same-gender relationships, but Bloom Into You does just that in a great coming-of-age story that is both sweet and fun. At just 13 episodes, it’s not rushed, and it doesn’t feel unfinished either, which can also be rare in romance anime.
Watch On HIDIVE</p>
<p>23  Odd Taxi (2021)
13 Episodes</p>
<p>Both a slice of life and a crime anime, Odd Taxi is pretty fascinating. It’s got anthropomorphic animals as its main characters, and the main character is a walrus who happens to drive taxis. His story cycles through a lot of eccentric passengers, but ultimately, it centers on him being connected to a missing person’s case. Hiroshi Odokawa might be blunt and a little eccentric himself, but his life is completely turned on its head when both the police force and members of the yakuza are set on him. There’s so much to enjoy in Odd Taxi, whether it’s the different passengers in the taxi, or the overall mystery, that fans might want to watch it twice.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>22  Yuri!!! On Ice (2012)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>Yuri!!! on Ice focuses on a prominent figure skater who finds himself suffering after a crushing loss, as well as a world champion figure skater who offers to help him out. The two find exactly what they need in one another when they’re not sure where their paths should point them next. Yuri!! on Ice became a massive hit thanks to its stellar animation and focus on same-sex relationships, and seven years after the original airing of the anime, fans and critics alike are still waiting in anticipation for the release of its sequel film, Yuri!!! on Ice the Movie: Ice Adolescence.

<p>21  The Yakuza’s Guide To Babysitting (2012)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>Some of the best short anime come from the unexpected situations characters are thrown into. This is certainly the case for The Yakuza&rsquo;s Guide to Babysitting, which follows a yakuza member whose boss thinks he doesn’t know how to rein in his darker tendencies. The solution is to have him babysit the boss’ young daughter, which seems like a bit of a stretch but makes for both a humorous and dramatic storyline. After all, a yakuza with no restraint tasked with handling the day-to-day responsibilities of his boss’ seven-year-old is bound to become a comedy of errors.

<p>20  Violet Evergarden (2018)
13 Episodes</p>
<p>Inspired by a light novel (released in four volumes) originally published in 2015, Violet Evergarden is an exploration of just what love means. It’s poignant and emotional to watch a character who doesn’t understand love slowly come to realize how it affects the world - and her. The titular character works as a transcriptionist following her time as a soldier in a war. When the last words of her mentor are “I love you”, she tries to understand them, and it takes her on a journey in which she tells other people’s stories while searching for answers. Violet Evergarden is short at 13 episodes, but it spawned two movies in the years that followed its release as well, making it a little longer of a watch than some of the other short anime here if fans want the full picture.
Watch On Netflix</p>
<p>19  Gunbuster &amp; Diebuster (1988 &amp; 2004)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>1988&rsquo;s Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster is notable for being an early work from the venerable Studio Gainax of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann fame, and just as notably, Gunbuster was the directorial debut of Hideaki Anno, the mastermind behind Neon Genesis Evangelion. Part campy &rsquo;80s training montage and part war story about the horrors of relativistic time during space travel, Gunbuster deserves its reputation as a classic. Gunbuster would eventually receive a sequel in 2004&rsquo;s Diebuster, and while somewhat controversial, both stories are still parts of a whole and deserve to be viewed both on their own merits and in relation to one another.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>18  Puella Magi Madoka Magica (2011)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>When recommending Puella Magi Madoka Magica , it&rsquo;s best not to say much about it other than to stick with it until the fourth episode at the very least. Madoka challenges the magical girl genre in a number of interesting ways; it&rsquo;s just that they don&rsquo;t reveal themselves until a viewer has settled into the show a bit. Although Madoka works well as a self-contained twelve-episode series, there are also a number of sequels and side stories in the form of movies and other adaptations. Fans typically consider some of these entries to be essential viewing, so those who find themselves wanting more can continue happily after finishing the original series.</p>
<p>Classic Magical Girl Anime Returns With New Movie After A Decade
Puella Magi Madoka Magica - Walpurgisnacht: Rising is the long-awaited continuation of the anime, and it finally has a trailer and release window.</p>
<p>Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>17  FLCL (2000)
6 Episodes</p>
<p>Combining an outlandish visual style with wild set pieces and excellent animation, FLCL is one of the best-regarded OVAs from Studio Gainax. Naota is an ordinary boy living in an ordinary town when a woman from space strikes him with a guitar which leads him to sprout a fighting robot from his forehead. Although its presentation and concepts might be bizarre at face value, FLCL is actually a surprisingly mature exploration of the transition into adulthood and what exactly adulthood ought to look like once one actually gets there. It&rsquo;s a classic single-season anime with only six episodes, so there isn&rsquo;t really a good reason not to watch it.
Watch On Hulu</p>
<p>16  Devilman Crybaby (2018)
10 Episodes</p>
<p>Devilman is one of the most influential manga ever created, which is why it&rsquo;s so incredible that the best version of Devilman might be its reboot Devilman Crybaby. The series follows a young man named Akira Fudo who is one day transformed into the ultra-powerful Devilman. Though his Devilman persona might be powerful, his obtaining those powers kicks off a chain of events that leads to incomprehensible disaster. This tightly-packed adaptation of the Go Nagai classic fits more action and gore into its 10 episodes than most series do in 50. Though Devilman Crybaby might be short, it leaves an impact that&rsquo;s nothing short of massive.
Watch On Netflix</p>
<p>15  Kaiba (2008)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>Despite its simple and pleasing aesthetic, Kaiba is an anime that isn&rsquo;t afraid to venture into the territory of the thoroughly dark and tragic. The show&rsquo;s characters inhabit a world where memories can be stored in special chips, allowing eternal life for a select few. The protagonist wakes without memories, his only possession being a locket with a photo of a woman in it, and things escalate from there. Touching on the role memory plays in the nature of identity and class divisions, Kaiba is as visually inventive as it is thematically engaging.

<p>14  No Game No Life (2014)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>No Game No Life features The Blank, a duo of elite gamers named Sora and Shiro who spend much of their time online due to their status as social outcasts. After defeating the god Tet in a game of chess, they are transported to a new realm known as Disboard and must conquer the land&rsquo;s various kingdoms to once again face Tet. While it may sound like relatively standard isekai fare, No Game No Life is bolstered by its flashy neon visuals and impeccable art direction, and the series is still held in high regard almost a decade after its initial premiere.

<p>13  A Place Further Than The Universe (2018)
13 Episodes</p>
<p>Four high school girls pursue a seemingly impossible goal to great lengths and with great determination in A Place Further Than The Universe, with the &ldquo;place&rdquo; in question being Antarctica. Despite the seemingly outlandish setup of the anime, the procedural struggles that the characters have to go through feel extremely realistic, making the show seem believable and compelling. Watching the characters develop individually and as a group is a joy, as well; in just twelve episodes, the audience comes to know the cast of A Place Further Than The Universe exceptionally well, and an emotionally charged climax seals the deal on an inspiring and uplifting anime.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>12  Death Parade (2015)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>After death, souls arrive at a purgatorial parlor and are made to compete in games like darts, billiards, and bowling while their demeanors are surreptitiously observed. After the game, those deemed worthy are reincarnated, and those deemed unworthy are sent to a place known as The Void. An anthology series of sorts, the tone and key characters of Death Parade change throughout this short anime series, though the otherworldly atmosphere remains consistent. Death Parade is a surreal and, at times, disturbing or outright horrifying outing, but its excellent presentation and thought-provoking premise make it a worthwhile watch for anime fans of all kinds.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>11  Anohana: The Flower We Say That Day (2011)
11 Episodes</p>
<p>Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day concerns Jinta Yadomi, a young shut-in who is haunted by a tragedy that occurred in his past. One day, Menma, the ghost of one of his old friends, returns and asks him to grant her final wish so that she may move on to the afterlife. Jinta then reunites with his old friend group so that they may discover what it is that must be done to appease Menma. Gripping and overtly emotional, Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day is a must-see for those who love tear-jerking anime. As short as it is poignant, Anohana will stay with viewers long after the credits roll after the eleventh episode.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>10  Terror In Resonance (2014)
11 Episodes</p>
<p>Coming from Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichiro Watanabe, Terror in Resonance is a 2014 anime by studio MAPPA. The series follows a high school student named Lisa as she becomes enthralled by two young terrorists known only as Nine and Twelve. Though that premise and the series&rsquo; name might make it sound like the series is about terrorism, the series&rsquo; actual central topic is a bit more specific, and with gorgeous animation and an absolutely haunting soundtrack by Yoko Kano, Terror in Resonance is one of the most beautiful short anime series.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>9  Tatami Galaxy (2010)
11 Episodes</p>
<p>Fans of the romance/college slice-of-life/existential time-loop nightmare genre look no further; Tatami Galaxy has it all. Directed by Masaaki Yuasa of Devilman Crybaby fame, Tatami Galaxy&rsquo;s unique aesthetics, funky tone, and memorable structure make it beloved among anime fans the world over. It&rsquo;s also a pretty weird show, albeit in the best possible way. The show follows a college student who is hopelessly in love and a malicious demon-boy set to thwart him at every turn. He&rsquo;s also caught in an endlessly repeating time loop ala Groundhog Day which complicates things, but it&rsquo;s also a huge part of the reason why the show&rsquo;s structure is so interesting.</p>
<p>8  Haibane Renmei (2002)
13 Episodes</p>
<p>Haibane Renmei tells the story of a young girl named Rakka born as a being called a &ldquo;Haibane&rdquo; in an unfamiliar world who gradually learns more about her fellow Haibane as well as the mysteries that seem to pervade this new world. Haibane Renmei&rsquo;s strength is in its subtlety, and it can be difficult to explain what makes the show so great without revealing too much about it. That being said, the show&rsquo;s fixation on the internal conflicts of its cast produces some exceptionally nuanced characters and writing; add in an engrossing and unique setting, and Haibane Renmei becomes a must-see.</p>
<p>7  Chainsaw Man (2022)
12 Episodes</p>
<p>Chainsaw Man is one of the biggest manga to come out of Weekly Shonen Jump in recent years, and its anime more than lives up to its reputation. The unique, film-inspired aesthetic of the manga is perfectly translated into bombastic fight scenes and gorgeous moments of serenity, and it&rsquo;s easy to understand why it was one of the biggest anime of 2022. It&rsquo;s unknown if Chainsaw Man will receive a second season, even with recently announced Chainsaw Man movie adapting the Reze arc, but even as a standalone series, Chainsaw Man has plenty to offer old and new fans alike.
Watch On Crunchyroll</p>
<p>6  Paranoia Agent (2004)
13 Episodes</p>
<p>Relentlessly weird and difficult to follow at times, Paranoia Agent is often hailed as one of the very best horror anime of all time. Principally concerning a series of attacks perpetrated by a mysterious baseball bat-wielding boy nicknamed Lil&rsquo; Slugger, the series explores the backstories of the attacker&rsquo;s various victims as well as the police officers assigned to track him down. Constantly shifting between characters, concepts, and sometimes even genres, Paranoia Agent packs quite a bit into a short, single-season run, and while it was the only original anime of the late Satoshi Kon, it&rsquo;s easily one of the best works he ever produced.</p>
