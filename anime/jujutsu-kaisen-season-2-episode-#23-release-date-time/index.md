## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Season 2 episode #23 will be the season finale, ending the Shibuya Incident arc on an epic note that will have major consequences.




After a stellar second season, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #23 will finish the Shibuya Incident arc and establish the status quo for the series going forward. With how many major events have occurred in this arc, this is a major question for fans looking forward to season 3. With many of the characters from season 1 now dead or otherwise disposed of, a new set of sorcerers and curses may need to be introduced.

If it isn&#39;t delayed, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #23 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, December 28. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on December 28 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #22 
          




Episode #22 began by revealing the fates of characters like Panda and Mei Mei who had appeared earlier in the arc. It then returned to the fight between Yuji and Mahito. Geto&#39;s body appeared to turn Mahito into an Uzumaki cursed technique, effectively killing him. However, before he could finish Yuji, the Kyoto students arrived and then later Choso, Kusakabe, and Panda joined the fray too. The mysterious Uraume was able to aid Geto&#39;s body, freezing the sorcerers opposing him. Luckily, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s powerful special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo appeared to take over the fighting, a prospect that clearly displeased Geto&#39;s possessor.



The sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body was also revealed to have possessed Noritoshi Kamo.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #23 Will End the Shibuya Incident 
          




The Shibuya Incident has been one of the best Shonen anime arcs in years and will likely be hugely influential on the series following in Jujutsu Kaisen’s footsteps. By this point in the story, most of the loose ends of the arc have been wrapped up in a brutal fashion, but the conclusion of the last big fight against Geto’s body for control of Gojo’s prison realm still needs to be shown. Given the mysterious special-grade Yuki Tsukumo has now gotten involved in the fight, the battle could end on an explosive note as she reveals the incredibly powerful abilities she possesses.

Beyond the battle itself, episode #23 will establish the status quo for the series moving forward. With Gojo gone, curses will be more emboldened and the world may become a more dangerous place for civilians and sorcerers alike. In addition, Yuji will likely come under attack by sorcerer society given the rampage Sukuna went on in his body. These changes will drastically affect the series moving forward, making Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #23 one that fans won’t want to miss when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 28.
