## Literature Review

Undead Unluck episode #7 showed just how terrifying Spoil is in a fight, and here&#39;s everything to know about when episode #8 will turn things around.




Undead Unluck episode #7 began the fight against Spoil in full force, and it’s already reached the point where the heroes have to give their all to come out of an otherwise desperate situation. It all led to episode #7 being one of the best of the show so far, and it leaves a lot to be desired for episode #8.

                  Undead Unluck: Every Union Member &amp; Their Abilities Explained   The Union is the main heroic group of Negators in Undead Unluck, and here&#39;s a breakdown of every character and their various abilities in the series.   



 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode #7? 
          




Undead Unluck episode #7, “Dream”, saw the continuation of Andy’s fight against the UMA Spoil, during which Fuko and Shen learned that zombification can be delayed so long as the victim believes in themself. As the fight went on, Fuko reluctantly loaded the zombies with Unluck so they could sacrifice themselves to deal blows to Spoil, including the zombie Andy married after learning that she sacrificed herself to protect the children. The zombies’ repeated sacrifices seemed effective at first, but then the tide of the battle began to shift as Spoil shrugged off the damage from Unluck and entered his second phase.

In Spoil’s second phase, his ability to make things rot progressed to the point of Andy’s regeneration being unable to keep up, and he was quickly overwhelmed. Spoil then bragged to Fuko about how beautiful he made the world by forcing things to rot and spoil away, but Fuko refutes Spoil’s claims and says that she’ll keep fighting so that her dream of living a normal life never spoils. At the same time, Shen revealed his dream to become the strongest in all creation, and the episode ended with him striking Spoil with a large staff reminiscent of Sun Wukong’s Ruyi Jingu Bang.

 Undead Unluck’s Newest Foe Will Push Andy To His Limit 
          

If there’s any takeaway from Undead Unluck episode #7, it’s that the fight with Spoil is going to push Andy to his utmost limits. With Spoil being the first opponent Andy can’t just power through with his regeneration, he’s going to need to find a way to make his powers work around Spoil’s enhanced abilities, possibly by bringing out the Victhor persona Shen talked about in episode #6. Whatever Andy has to do to fight Spoil is bound to be great to watch and do a lot to push his story forward, and seeing it play out in Undead Unluck episode #8 will undoubtedly be great to see.




Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #8 when it airs on November 24.
