## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #14 will show more of the new party dynamics now that the priest Sein has joined the main cast of the series.




With Frieren&#39;s party gaining a new member, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #14 should be an interesting indicator of how well he fits in with the rest of the cast. This question was partially answered by his introduction in episode #13. However, it will take seeing how he reacts to a standard Frieren adventure to fully know how Sein will affect the group&#39;s dynamics. If the new number 1 MyAnimeList series continues to maintain its quality, Sein&#39;s inclusion can push the anime to new levels.





 What Time Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #14 Releases 
          

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #14 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, December 8. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on December 8 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #13? 
          

Episode #13 began with Frieren helping a priest named Sein out of quicksand. After Stark got bitten by a poisonous snake, Sein was able to quickly heal him, showing his magical skill. This caused Stark to try and recruit him to Frieren&#39;s party, but he refused saying it was too late for him to set out on an adventure, after giving up on that same dream ten years before. This reminded Frieren of herself when Himmel asked her to join his party, so she resolved not to leave town until they had recruited Sein to the party. After having a confrontation with his brother and realizing that he regretted not becoming an adventurer sooner, Sein agreed to adventure with Frieren and her friends.






Frieren also unleashed a hilarious new &#34;seduction&#34; technique against Sein.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #14 Will Show More of Sein 
          

Now that Sein has officially joined the party, it will be interesting to see how he takes to the adventuring lifestyle. Given his tendencies for drinking and gambling, Sein may get involved with the more unsavory elements of each village they visit. This could lead to fun antics as he meets with disapproval from sterner characters like Fern. Also, given his childhood friend likely died at the hands of demons, if he encounters some of Frieren&#39;s fascinating villains he may have an interesting reaction to them. If Sein&#39;s friend is actually alive, then he could potentially even encounter him and reckon with how they have grown apart.




While Frieren&#39;s quieter adventures may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, it is a large part of what makes the series so great. The anime has shown that its longer arcs are incredible, but its more episodic adventures are what makes Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End so revolutionary. Hopefully episode #14 will explore Sein&#39;s character while also continuing Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s thoughtful pacing.

Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #14 when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 8, 2023.
