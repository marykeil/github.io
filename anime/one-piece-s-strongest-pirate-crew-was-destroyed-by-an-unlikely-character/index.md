## Literature Review

Garp and Roger helped destroy One Piece&#39;s strongest Pirate Crew at God Valley, but they couldn&#39;t have done it without the help of a surprising ally.




Warning: Spoilers For One Piece Manga Chapter #1096




One Piece&#39;s God Valley flashback finally revealed the mastermind behind the destruction of Rocks Pirates, the series&#39; most powerful Pirate Crew. One of the series&#39; most anticipated flashbacks has finally shed some light on the God Valley Incident that shifted the landscape of the world&#39;s powers. The mysterious epic battle saw a clash between the Rocks Pirates, the Roger Pirates, the evil World Nobiles, and Garp and the Marines, and now, readers know who brought the world&#39;s strongest forces together.

Series author Eiichiro Oda has teased readers by not revealing a lot of what fans expected to see during One Piece&#39;s God Valley flashback. While events like Rocks D. Xebec&#39;s introduction and Roger&#39;s team-up with Garp will likely be shown later in the story, chapter #1096 revealed that a 13-year-old girl sparked the events of God Valley. 

          




Ginny was introduced as a young runaway slave who worked with Emporio Ivankov and Kuma to escape their hellish existence under the Celestial Dragons. However, her particular set of skills would lead to the death of One Piece&#39;s most notorious pirate, Rocks D. Xebec.


 The 13-Year-Old Ginny Changed One Piece&#39;s World Forever 
          

The plan to escape the Celestial Dragon&#39;s depraved manhunt proved more noble than well-planned for the young captives. Even at such a young age, Ginny was what she called &#34;a pro at thieving, tapping, and transmissions,&#34; those skills managed to gather pivotal information that would help save over 500 hundred people in God Valley and forever change the lives of One Piece&#39;s residents. World Nobles stole a prized treasure from Rocks base on Pirate Island, and thanks to Ginny&#39;s broadcasted information, they knew where to find it.




                  One Piece&#39;s Rock Pirates Finally Get Their Full Appearance Revealed   One Piece has finally revealed more of the Rocks Pirates and the crew has some unexpected members many of whom Luffy has already met.   

The young friend of Ivankov simply meant to create a decoy for their plan to steal the Noble&#39;s Devil Fruit prizes and use them to escape the island to succeed. However, the end results of sharing the location of the World Noble&#39;s demented contest would lead to the world&#39;s most powerful pirate crew disbanding and several of One Piece&#39;s rarest Devil Fruits scattered and found by pivotal characters in Luffy&#39;s journey. By sheer accident, Ginny set in motion a plan that would lead to the Straw Hat Crew confronting the World Nobles on Egghead Island and, perhaps someday, the destruction of the rule of the vile Celestial Dragons.



 One Piece Is Not Finished Showing The God Valley Incident 
          




Captain Rocks D. Xebec remains one of One Piece&#39;s most mysterious characters. Eiichiro Oda teased readers in chapter #1096 by choosing not to show him in the anticipated God Valley flashback. Instead, the chapter follows Kuma and Ginny&#39;s escape from the island and the start of their lives outside of slavery. In a heartbreaking chapter ending, they are seen eating till they are full for the first time in their lives. While she may never know it, Ginny deserves all the food and every tear of happiness she shed because without her, God Valley would have been only a sick game for the World Nobles and not the beginning of One Piece&#39;s new world that Luffy would help usher in.
