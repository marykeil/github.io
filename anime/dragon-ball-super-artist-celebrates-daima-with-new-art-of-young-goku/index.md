## Literature Review

The artist behind Dragon Ball Super has made adorable art of young Goku in his monthly drawing series.





To celebrate the franchise&#39;s newest entry, the artist of the Dragon Ball Super manga Toyotarou made a cute drawing of young Goku for his monthly drawing challenge. The monthly series features all kinds of sketches made by the talented artist, and it seems he is just as excited as fans are.




          

The sketch also featured a message from him, that is roughly translated to:


Dragon Ball DAIMA was just announced!
I&#39;m really looking forward to the release next fall!
——Toyotarou


                  Dragon Ball Daima Release Window, Trailer, Story, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   Dragon Ball Daima is a new anime from series creator Akira Toriyama that stars Goku and Vegeta in an original story that is not what fans expect.   


 Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Artist Hypes Up Daima 

 

Maybe it is because Toyotarou is very close with Akira Toriyama, the creator of the Dragon Ball franchise, and works with him, but it seems like the anime industry is just as excited as many ordinary fans. His anticipation for the release of the new series shows just how big of an influence Dragon Ball has had on the entertainment industry and the world. Everyone is very hyped for the series to air. This may be because of nostalgia as fans will finally see a child version of Goku, and the last time they saw that was back in the 1990s.




                  Dragon Ball Daima Release Window, Trailer, Story, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   Dragon Ball Daima is a new anime from series creator Akira Toriyama that stars Goku and Vegeta in an original story that is not what fans expect.   

Taking place after the Majin Buu arc, Dragon Ball Daima is &#34;A story never told before in Dragon Ball&#34;. A wish is made to the mighty dragon Shenron that turns many of the cast of the series into children: Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, Supreme Kai Shin, Picollo, and more. Who was responsible for the wish is unknown, but the gang must figure out how to turn themselves back to normal. With two unknown villains on the loose and their bodies not being at full power, Dragon Ball Daima will feature a great adventure from the beloved characters that will be a must-see.



Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama explained that Daima is a made-up word meaning evil.







Dragon Ball Daima will feature even more supervision from Akira Toriyama than he did with Dragon Ball Super, which is great news as he will steer the series in a direction that embodies the original. As the wait for new episodes of Dragon Ball Super only grows longer, this new original series will make the wait a little more bearable. With the incredible animation and visuals, the trailer presented and the entertaining plot, Dragon Ball Daima will undoubtedly make 2024 an even better year for anime than expected.
