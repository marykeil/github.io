Pokémon Horizons Episode #36 showcases a Pokémon love story featuring the Paldean Pokémon Oinkologne in its anime debut. Here&#39;s how fans can watch the next episode and find out what happens.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

For Pokémon Horizons, new episodes debut in Japan on the network TVTokyo on Fridays at 6:55 PM JST. Consequently, episode #36 of Pokémon Horizons will air on January 19, 2024, at 6:55 PM JST. That time is equivalent to 1:55 AM Pacific Time and 4:55 AM Eastern Time, a window that&#39;s highly inconvenient for any potential American viewers tuning in via satellite.

Given that these broadcasts are intended for Japanese audiences, they lack subtitles, so fans will need to have some knowledge of the Japanese language to follow the plot. The English dub of Pokémon Horizons has already begun airing in some areas, such as the UK, while it will debut in the US on Netflix on March 7, 2024.



Pokémon Horizons was originally scheduled to release in the US on February 23, but was recently pushed back to March 7.









 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #35? 
          

Pokémon Horizons Episode #35 saw the crew taking on a job searching for a missing Pokémon, a Bramblin, to earn some extra cash. Liko and Roy accompany Friede on the job, as Liko is writing a school paper on Friede&#39;s relationship to Captain Pikachu. Liko finds that Cap and Friede have a very unusual relationship that&#39;s not quite as perfect as it sometimes looks, but when the chips are down, the two can always find a way to work together. They put this to the test by rescuing Bramblin from some Pokémon Hunters, ultimately defeating the crew of evildoers and seeing them arrested.



 Pokémon Horizons Episode #36 is a Pokémon Love Story 
          




Nidothing&#39;s latest video draws in a request from some fans asking for advice, as this trainer&#39;s Pokémon is looking sluggish and unmotivated. It seems from the preview that this trainer&#39;s Oinkologne is in love with another Oinkologne, but the feelings aren&#39;t reciprocated. Dot&#39;s Quaxly is determined to help out, and will apparently play a rather large role in the episode. The episode as a whole is looking to be another breather episode, like #35, as the crew continues on to their next plot-related destination.

Pokémon Horizons has two formats it has tended to use for episodes so far: plot episodes and traveling episodes, with the latter being more like the monster-of-the-week-style episodes that made up the bulk of the series when Ash was the protagonist. The traveling episodes are often still quite good, and provide some valuable insight into the characters (as demonstrated in episode #35 with Friede and Cap&#39;s relationship).

Still, one can&#39;t help but hope for a return to the plot soon, especially with so many potential avenues for the story to go down. Fortunately, these episodes have yet to overstay their welcome, so it&#39;s likely fans can expect a return to Pokémon Horizons&#39; action before long.
