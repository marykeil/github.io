## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season featured moments that shook viewers to their cores as well as twists that surprised them in devastating ways.




Warning! Contains MAJOR SPOILERS for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2!
Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season featured a lot of brutal twists that shocked fans to their core. This is a great feature of the series as the Shonen genre is often very predictable, making some shows in it feel stale. The Gojo&#39;s Past arc and the Shibuya Incident bucked this trend and showed why Jujutsu Kaisen is a cutting-edge series.
Part of what made these twists so shocking was the relatively standard first season of the show. There was a very surprising moment near the beginning where Yuji was “killed off” for a time and Junpei&#39;s death at the hands of Mahito was also tragically surprising, but neither of these moments was viscerally shocking. Season 2 mixed things up by delivering gut-punching moments that no one expected and also making some shocking changes to the series&#39;s status quo. This made it a show fans eagerly awaited each week as they didn&#39;t know what would happen next. This is often a rarity in the Shonen genre, and thus elevated Jujutsu Kaisen above its peers.









 








 10  The Status Quo Changes In The Finale 
Occurred in Episode #23
        

Part of what made the Shibuya Incident so shocking is that it had major permanent effects on the series moving forward. The finale encapsulates this perfectly, thrusting the viewers into the confusion of the public at large and slowly revealing that no one is safe anymore, not even civilians. It also manages to still surprise viewers with the suddenness of its violence against civilians, even though many could likely sense what was coming. These status quo changes aren&#39;t as viscerally shocking as many other moments in the season, but they are still pretty surprising.
This will likely lead to some more shocking moments next season. 






 9  Sukuna&#39;s Revival Was a Terrifying Reintroduction 
Occurred in Episode #15
        

Unfortunately, the opening of the anime spoiled that Sukuna would be coming back to wreak havoc in the Shibuya Incident. However, this didn&#39;t diminish the impact of his return, which reminded fans why he is such a terrifying villain. Immediately upon being summoned he chopped off the top of Jogo&#39;s head for not bowing deep enough and killed two of the sorcerers who revived him for their insolence. While what Sukuna would do next would eventually prove to be even more shocking, his initial revival is still a frightening reminder of how powerful he is.





 8  Gojo Losing to Toji in His Past Was Completely Unexpected 
Occurred in Episode #3
        

In the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo gives off such an air of invincibility that it is hard to imagine he could ever lose a fight. This is part of what made his battle against Toji so shocking in the Gojo’s Past arc, as the powerful mercenary brutally beat Gojo without even using any Cursed Energy and then left him apparently lifeless on the ground. Of course, given Gojo was alive after the events of this arc, no one reasonably thought that he had actually died there. But this sense of security still served to make his brutal defeat one of the more shocking moments of the season.





 7  Toji’s Rampage in Shibuya Defied Expectations 
Occurred from Episode #11 to Episode #16


 







Toji was an incredibly cool and powerful character in the Gojo’s Past arc, so many fans were disappointed when Gojo killed him, effectively removing him from the series. This is part of what made it so exciting and shocking when he was revived by an enemy sorcerer in the Shibuya Incident. After that he became a wild card, brutally killing the Disaster Curse Dagon and even attacking his own son. Even his ultimate demise was unexpected, with Toji ending his own life to avoid killing Megumi. Toji was one of the biggest wild cards in an arc filled with unpredictable characters, which is part of what made his reintroduction so exhilarating.





 6  Sukuna’s Rampage in Shibuya Showed Why He Is Feared 
Occurred in Episode #16 and Episode #17


 







Sukuna is one of the most powerful characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, and the Shibuya Incident reminded viewers of this fact in an absolutely shocking way. Shonen battles certainly are no stranger to causing bombastic damage to their environments. Sukuna took that to another level, first by destroying Jogo in a battle that burned and blew up much of the city. However, his battle with Mahoraga was truly the ultimate expression of Sukuna’s destructive potential, as he used his Domain Expansion to annihilate a large chunk of Tokyo and all the people contained inside it. This sort of callous destruction is rare in Shonen manga, which makes Sukuna’s ultimate death toll very surprising.
The incredible animation of Sukuna&#39;s fights also added to their shock value. 






 5  Gojo Being Sealed Made Everything More Dangerous 
Occurred in Episode #9 and Episode #10
        

Gojo is one of the most powerful characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. Before the Shibuya Incident arc, Gojo at the peak of his power never came close to losing. Even the Gojo’s Past arc, which showed a teenage Gojo suffering a shocking loss ended by showing the sorcerer overcome that defeat and reach new heights of power. All of this made it especially shocking when, after being worn down by multiple powerful enemies and the threat of killing a crowd of civilians, Gojo was sealed away in a mysterious prison realm. Even more surprising is the fact that he is still trapped there at the end of the arc, marking a serious change in the series’s status quo.





 4  Nanami&#39;s Death Was Tragic For Yuji and the Audience 
Occurred in Episode #18
        

It was already shocking enough when Jogo appeared after the fight with Dagon concluded and burned Nanami, Maki, and Naobito Zenin in quick succession. This made it seem like the fan-favorite sorcerer had died a horrible and abrupt death. Thus when Nanami was revealed to be alive and still fighting even while badly burned it gave fans a glimmer of hope that he might survive. Unfortunately, this hope was snatched away as the sadistic Curse Mahito took advantage of his weakened state to brutally murder Nanami in front of Yuji. After all that buildup, this was just as shocking for the audience as it was for Itadori.
Jogo&#39;s treatment of Maki and Naobito were also shocking but didn&#39;t get as much focus. 






 3  The Reveal of Geto&#39;s True Nature Was a Grotesque Surprise 
Occurred in Episode #9
        

During the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen, fans were made to believe that the main antagonist of the series is Suguru Geto, a former Jujutsu High student who went rogue on a mission to kill all non-sorcerers. After all, the villain had Geto&#39;s face and used his powers, so why would he be anyone different? As time passed, subtle flaws in this seeming fact began to show, but not enough to ruin the surprise from the reveal in Season 2 that the main villain of the series isn&#39;t Geto but someone possessing his body. The grotesque nature of the reveal, opening up the sorcerer&#39;s skull, only served to make this more shocking.





 2  Riko&#39;s Death Was the First Sign of the Tragedies to Come 
Occurred in Episode #3
        

Jujutsu Kaisen has always been a dark show. Junpei&#39;s fate in Season 1 is a perfect example of this. But despite this darkness, the protagonists still generally won despite some tragedies they accrue along the way. Riko&#39;s death in the Gojo&#39;s Past arc changed that, having Toji successfully kill the young vessel by shooting her in the head at the most emotional part of her character arc. The way the anime used Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s ending theme to further lull viewers into a false sense of security before blowing it all away showed its audience that moving forward, no moment or character was safe.





 1  Fans Still Haven&#39;t Gotten Over Nobara&#39;s Death 
Occurred in Episode #19


 







Nobara is easily one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most popular characters for good reason. Her brash attitude and aggressively platonic relationship with Yuji and Megumi is a firm contrast to other women in Shonen that came before and her fighting style is incredibly cool. This made it even more tragic when the Curse Mahito seemingly killed her by blowing up one of her eyes. This is a brutal death by a sadistic villain who rubbed it in both Yuji and the audience&#39;s faces after he killed her. The death is so shocking that many fans refuse to believe she is dead. That makes Nobara&#39;s death the most brutal and shocking moment in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2.
