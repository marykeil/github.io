<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Prepare to dive into Armageddon as every hero enlisted in Nightwing&rsquo;s vampire army from DC vs. Vampires is ranked weakest to strongest.</p>
<p>In the bloody setting of DC vs. Vampires, the sun has forever set on the DC Universe in this Elseworlds series, all thanks to the ingenious machinations of Nightwing. Dick Grayson, the Titan-turned-vampire-overlord, orchestrated a successful coup against the previous vampire ruler, Mary Queen of Blood. Afterward, he infiltrated the hero ranks, transforming those who were once champions of good into his own personal vampire army.
Amidst the unexpected twist of vampirism, DC&rsquo;s power dynamics have been upended, leading to a reshuffling of the hero hierarchy in the world of DC vs. Vampires, which spans a number of books. The main series, DC vs. Vampires by James Tynion IV, Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, Simone Di Meo, Tom Napolitano, Daniele Di Nicuolo, Rex Lokus, Pierluigi Casolino, and Francesco Mortarino, follows the main storyline, while a number of spin-off series and one-shots take readers into the unseen corners of this universe. Sink your teeth into a comprehensive roster of all the heroes who succumbed to bloodlust under Nightwing&rsquo;s rule, classified from the &ldquo;less-bitten&rdquo; to the truly &ldquo;fang-tastic powerhouses&rdquo; of this new world order.
The sequel to DC vs. Vampires, DC vs. Vampires: World War V by Rosenberg and Schmidt, will launch in 2024 from DC Comics.</p>
<p>Nightwing Sums Up the DCU&rsquo;s 85-Year History with One Line
For all of its hijinks and adventures, family is the core theme of the modern DCU, and no one emulates that better than Nightwing, DC&rsquo;s &ldquo;first son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>34  Nightrider</p>
<p>Considering that he was killed by candle wax, Nightrider gets the crowning achievement of being the weakest vampire in the entirety of the comic series. What makes his death even more pathetic is that he indulged in a lengthy monologue, portraying himself as a menacing and powerful vampire who had finally embraced his true nature. Yet, he failed to claim a single victim and met his end in the most ridiculous manner imaginable. Adding to the irony, Nightrider had been a vampire long before Nightwing&rsquo;s ascent to power. Fans might assume that his extended tenure as an undead creature would have granted him some level of expertise in being a successful vampire, but apparently not.</p>
<p>33  B&rsquo;wana Beast</p>
<p>B&rsquo;wana Beast&rsquo;s brief foray into vampirism might just give Nightrider a run for his money in the race for the most pathetic vampire title. Much like Nightrider, Beast exuded an unearned confidence in his abilities, boldly declaring that he would handle Green Arrow all on his own. However, this bravado quickly met a hilariously swift end when he found himself on the wrong end of one of Queen&rsquo;s arrows. The absurdity of his near-immediate demise bordered on the comical, leaving little room for the audience to believe that Beast possessed any real aptitude for being a vampire.</p>
<p>32  James Gordon</p>
<p>James Gordon&rsquo;s brief tenure as a vampire turned out to be nothing short of a letdown. The disappointment largely stems from his woefully ill-conceived plan to ensnare and eliminate one of the last surviving heroes. In a desperate bid to lure a hero, Gordon activated the Bat-Signal, and Batgirl promptly answered the call. While Gordon feigned helplessness and the need for her assistance, his scheme proved to be transparently feeble. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Batgirl to see through the charade, and the result was a swift and decisive end to his ill-fated endeavor, marked by her ruthless dispatching of the former commissioner.</p>
<p>DC Explains the One Reason a Vampire Apocalypse Is Its Biggest Threat
The heroes of the DC Universe have been struggling against the vampire virus, but one hero knows they were always doomed to fail.</p>
<p>31  Looker</p>
<p>Looker&rsquo;s stint as a vampire turned out to be a source of immense embarrassment for the undead community. Armed with a whole horde of vampires, she launched an ambush on Black Lightning. However, the hero managed to thwart her grand designs with almost laughable ease. In an act of misguided overconfidence, Looker ventured into Jefferson&rsquo;s home, unaware that it had been rigged as a trap. The moment Jefferson activated the fire sprinklers, which were blessed by a priest and infused with holy water, the outcome was sealed. Jefferson let off a surge of lightning, electrocuting and dispatching every vampire in the vicinity, including Looker herself.</p>
<p>30  Mister Terrific</p>
<p>Mister Terrific held a significant leadership role within the vampire ranks, but, despite his otherwise commendable achievements, his repeated lapses in allowing Harley Quinn to evade capture proved to be a pivotal error. This seemingly minor omission had far-reaching consequences, as Harley&rsquo;s actions led to her injecting herself with Lex Luthor&rsquo;s blood, turning herself into literal vampire poison. The repercussions of this oversight extended even further, ultimately playing a pivotal role in the fall of Vampire King Nightwing. Mister Terrific&rsquo;s inability to manage this critical situation stood as a major blunder within the vampire hierarchy, resulting in unexpected and costly consequences for their regime.</p>
<p>29  Doctor Mid-Nite</p>
<p>Doctor Mid-Nite, while a formidable presence in the vampire ranks, shared a notable misstep with Mister Terrific. His mistake involved letting Harley Quinn escape on multiple occasions, which would inadvertently lead to the creation of a lethal vampire poison, thanks to an experiment with Lex Luthor&rsquo;s blood sample. The consequences of this error played a significant role in the demise of Vampire King Nightwing. Hence, this lapse in judgment positioned Doctor Mid-Nite alongside Mister Terrific in the lower ranks of the vampire hierarchy.</p>
<p>28  Fairchild</p>
<p>Caitlin Fairchild&rsquo;s tenure as a vampire was disappointingly brief. In an almost paradoxical fashion, she was introduced and swiftly staked by Jack Hawksmoor in the very same issue. Although her time as a vampire was fleeting, it&rsquo;s evident that she didn&rsquo;t fit the mold of the &ldquo;nice&rdquo; vampires, even if her character didn&rsquo;t play a significant role in the major plotlines of the series. This short-lived appearance left readers with little to unravel about her character&rsquo;s potential contributions to the narrative.
WildStorm fans can check out recent appearance of Caitlin Fairchild in WildC.A.T.S by Rosenberg and Stephen Segovia.</p>
<p>27  Catman</p>
<p>Catman exhibited his combat prowess when he launched an ambush on Talia al Ghul&rsquo;s compound, putting up a commendable fight in the treacherous sewers. However, his journey took an unexpected turn when he ultimately met his demise at the hands of Jimmy Olsen, the Daily Planet&rsquo;s renowned photographer. While not the most glorious or anticipated outcome, it added a unique twist to the storyline, proving that in the world of vampires, even unexpected contenders can shape the course of events.</p>
<p>26  Jenny Sparks</p>
<p>Jenny Sparks&rsquo; involvement as a vampire in the series carries an air of enigmatic intrigue. While the specifics of her vampire activities remain shrouded in mystery, one undeniable fact is her responsibility for the death of Swift, a significant loss in the narrative. However, she was also deemed big enough of a threat to warrant Apollo sacrificing himself in a desperate measure taken to eliminate her. Jenny&rsquo;s enigmatic role as a vampire adds a layer of complexity to the series, leaving fans to wonder about the exact nature of her involvement in the narrative.</p>
<p>25  Loose Cannon</p>
<p>Loose Cannon&rsquo;s involvement in the vampire cause can be best described as a nuisance rather than a substantial asset. His main contribution was to serve as an irritant, creating a distraction during Green Arrow&rsquo;s mission to eliminate Hawkman. Their clash did provide readers with an epic battle scene, but Loose Cannon proved not to be a major player in the grand scheme of things. His time in the spotlight was cut short when he met a swift and explosive demise courtesy of one of Oliver Queen&rsquo;s signature exploding arrows.</p>
<p>24  Zatanna</p>
<p>Zatanna&rsquo;s journey as a vampire was rather uneventful, with her most notable action being the murder of Penguin, a feat overshadowed by the grander accomplishments of other vampires. Her transition into vampirism was not subtle, as she was quickly discovered by the keen-eyed John Constantine before she could make a move. This unfortunate outing eventually led to her unceremonious demise at the hands of Doctor Fate, concluding her story with an unexpectedly anticlimactic end. Zatanna, a powerful magic user, fell short of reaching her potential as a vampire, a twist that left her narrative somewhat underwhelming.</p>
<p>DC&rsquo;s Vampire Apocalypse Is Ignoring Its Most OP Hero
The heroes of the DC Universe are currently facing a vampire plague that threatens the whole planet, but they&rsquo;ve had the solution all along.</p>
<p>23  Atomic Knight</p>
<p>Atomic Knight occupies the middle ground in the ranks of vampires, neither ascending to the upper echelons of their might nor plummeting into utter ineptitude. He demonstrated formidable abilities but ultimately met his demise in an encounter with Booster Gold. While his performance didn&rsquo;t stand out as exceptional, Atomic Knight also didn&rsquo;t disrupt the vampires&rsquo; machinations, managing to avoid any major blunders. In the grand scheme of the vampire regime, Atomic Knight&rsquo;s tenure was characterized by competence without achieving greatness, landing him somewhere in the middle of their hierarchy.</p>
<p>22  Miss Martian</p>
<p>Miss Martian, once a formidable hero, didn&rsquo;t quite shine in her role as a vampire during the series. Her full potential as a vampire remained largely untapped, and viewers never had the opportunity to witness the extent of her Martian powers after her vampire transformation. Ultimately, she was defeated and failed to prevent Supergirl from reaching the sun, a critical mission for the vampire regime. While Miss Martian&rsquo;s transition into a vampire held great promise, her performance in the series didn&rsquo;t do justice to her heroic legacy, leaving much untold about her vampire abilities.</p>
<p>21  Firestorm</p>
<p>Firestorm finds himself in a lower position on this list due to a series of unfortunate events that unfolded during his stint in the vampire-ridden world. Despite being an undeniable powerhouse, he inadvertently triggered a nuclear blast upon his demise that claimed the lives of over 200 vampires. This unintended act effectively dealt a more significant blow to his own side than to the humans. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Firestorm did manage to notch some noteworthy kills during his time in the conflict. His actions led to the demise of prominent figures like Killer Frost, Director Bones, and Negative Man, all of whom were aligned with the human resistance.</p>
<p>20  Shining Knight</p>
<p>Despite demonstrating remarkable resilience by taking a punch from Mary Marvel without flinching, Shining Knight unwittingly sealed his own fate with a candid confession. He revealed to the heroine that physical force would prove futile against him, as his armor was infused with the same powers that coursed through her veins. This inadvertent revelation ultimately proved to be his undoing when Mary retaliated with a powerful strike of lightning, abruptly ending his life. However, Shining Knight retains some respect as a vampire, as he had impeccable manners and referred to Mary as &ldquo;milady.&rdquo; Manners are superpowers, too, after all.</p>
<p>19  Black Adam</p>
<p>Even in the main DC Universe, Black Adam always stands as a formidable force, one to be reckoned with. However, his tenure as a vampire was marked by its astonishing brevity, almost to the point of being comical. Black Adam&rsquo;s introduction in the series culminated in his abrupt demise at the hands of a fellow vampire, Kate Kane, who, despite also being a vampire, remained aligned with the forces of good. In a dramatic turn of events, Kate immolated Black Adam, ending his brief but memorable stint as a vampire.</p>
<p>18  Raven</p>
<p>Raven&rsquo;s minimal presence in the series left fans yearning for more of the enigmatic character. Her limited appearances were a source of disappointment, considering her potential as a complex and powerful figure in the face of the undead apocalypse. The lingering mystery surrounding her fate adds to the intrigue, suggesting that she may still be alive and serving her evil overlords. Raven&rsquo;s mysterious nature and formidable powers would have made her a captivating addition to the series&rsquo; main storyline, leaving fans to wonder about the untapped potential of her character in this grim world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;World War V&rdquo;: DC vs. Vampires Sequel Reveals the Undead Apocalypse&rsquo;s &ldquo;Most Deadly Threat Yet&rdquo;
Just announced at NYCC, DC vs. Vampires: World War V will launch the publisher&rsquo;s new Elseworlds line, continuing the hit 2021 series.</p>
<p>17  Plastic Man</p>
<p>Plastic Man played a central role in turning the immensely powerful Raven into a vampire before his own ultimate demise at the hands of Jayna, one-half of the formidable Wonder Twins. This unexpected turn of events presented a colossal setback for humanity in their struggle against the vampire menace. Raven&rsquo;s status as one of the most potent characters within the expansive DC Universe was undeniable, and her potential as a game-changer in the fight against the undead was substantial. Yet, Plastic Man&rsquo;s actions have left fans to ponder the gravity of this pivotal moment and the unforeseen toll it ultimately took on humanity&rsquo;s hopes for survival.</p>
<p>16  Mirage</p>
<p>Mirage played a major role in the demise of the formidable Bane. Mirage defied the odds by orchestrating a surprise attack on the juggernaut of a man, catching even the seemingly invulnerable off guard. Her attempt to transform Bane into a vampire was a significant moment, but a twist of fate intervened. Deadman&rsquo;s possession of Bane&rsquo;s body ultimately led to the once-villain-now-hero snapping his own neck. In the fight for humanity, Mirage&rsquo;s involvement left a lasting impact, resulting in the downfall of a key player.</p>
<p>15  Wonder Girl</p>
<p>Wonder Girl&rsquo;s presence in the series solidifies her status as one of the vampire&rsquo;s heavy hitters. While the specifics of her kills remain unconfirmed, her relentless pursuit of the human resistance force made her a formidable adversary throughout the narrative. Her resilience and enduring survival streak showcased her ability to endure and thrive in the midst of the ongoing conflict. As a recurring vampire character, Wonder Girl served as a constant source of tension and challenge for the resistance, leaving an indelible mark on the series and underscoring her significance within the ranks of the undead.</p>
