                  Director Masaaki Yuasa Interview: Inu-Oh   Director Masaaki Yuasa sits down with Screen Rant to talk about his latest film, Inu-Oh.   

Though Yuasa&#39;s work spans a wide variety of tones and subjects, they&#39;re all united by the legendary director&#39;s unique vision. To celebrate the release of Masaaki Yuasa: Five Films Collector&#39;s Edition, we spoke with Yuasa about his creative process, his interactions with fans, and how he views his work in retrospect.


 Masaaki Yuasa On The Overarching Themes of His Work 
          




Screen Rant: So given how different each of your works are, and more specifically how different each of the films in this upcoming collection are, is there any particular theme or set of theme themes that unite each of your films and each of your broader works in your mind? 


Masaaki Yuasa: I think my overall theme, or what I see that is the same in all of my protagonists, is that they&#39;re binded by something and then there&#39;s a release. I really think that&#39;s always depicted in my movies and recently I&#39;m able to incorporate more of how I feel or how what my thoughts of this era are into my work.


More than a few of your works in this upcoming collection are adaptations of critically acclaimed and beloved stories. When you&#39;re adapting something, how do you decide what to change and how do you decide what to keep the same? How do you keep that essential essence of a story while adapting it to a new medium? 


Masaaki Yuasa: Yeah, so basically what I do is, I read or watch the original and then take what I felt during that process and then translate that into the movie. So, if there are some changes, I don&#39;t really think about it. I don&#39;t think like oh, I&#39;m going to change this I&#39;m going to keep this. I don&#39;t take notes on that it&#39;s really about me and my staff trying to translate our feelings and what we can do with animation at that moment and then making that into the film.





Both the production and consumption of anime has changed a lot since the release of Mind Game in 2004 and the release of Inu-Oh a few years back. What do you think of the anime industry now compared to when Mind Game was released? Are there things that are better or worse about it, or has it mostly stayed the same from your perspective? 


Masaaki Yuasa: I think going digital is really a good thing that changed the industry. We&#39;re able to do a lot more different things and a lot more new things going digital. There&#39;s a lot more development within the staff as well. Recently though, I found that with the changes in the industry, it&#39;s really hard for everyone to be united emotionally to create a project.
I asked them, like, &#39;Is that because of the environment or is that because of the way they think?&#39; And it&#39;s really like the way they think, you know, they&#39;re thinking We&#39;re the animators or the staff, they don&#39;t really feel like, Okay, yeah, I&#39;ll cooperate with you to create this new project. The passion is weaning because I guess the industry is just pumping out so much animation and anime.
It&#39;s really hard to keep the morale and motivation up so I think the current challenge for us, you know, is to create an environment that&#39;s easy to maintain the motivation and passion of the staff.







 Masaaki Yuasa About His Growth as a Director Since Mind Game 
          

On a more personal note, how do you feel that you personally have grown as a creator between the release of Mind Game and now? Do you feel like your style has evolved? I know part of that&#39;s going to be, like you mentioned, the switch to digital, but are there any other changes that you felt in your creative process?


Masaaki Yuasa: Yeah, when I worked on Mind Game that was really the era when the whole industry was really getting into the digital evolution, so I was creating it more freely. But then, after that, I really think I evolved into a director who thinks more about how to communicate with the audience, how to convey to the audience what this project is about.
And also I started thinking about what can I do to help the staff grow or allow the staff to learn so that they could bring out their best potential.





Which of the films in this collection was the most fun to work on and which was the most difficult?


Masaaki Yuasa: A lot of them are difficult to work on, but it&#39;s mostly difficult in the sense that all production is difficult. You know, I really think about how much fun I&#39;m having while I&#39;m creating because I&#39;m challenging myself or trying new things. So it&#39;s hard to say like, which one&#39;s more difficult.
For most fun. That&#39;s also hard because I do have fun making all of them. But with Mind Game, because it was my directorial debut, I wasn&#39;t really thinking much. I was just so focused on doing it and getting the work done. Yeah, that&#39;s a hard question.


You&#39;ve become one of the most respected and beloved directors currently working in Japan and I think these movies certainly show why. What was the specific moment where you realized that you&#39;d really made it as a director?


Masaaki Yuasa: I still don&#39;t feel that I made it and I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m that highly revered. I don&#39;t know if the critics liked me so much. But I&#39;ll like to get there one day. I still like to keep trying. I still like to continue to try to make projects that would make audiences engaged and happy.







 Masaaki Yuasa on Creating the First Anime Funded Through Kickstarter 
          

The collection also includes a new release of the short film Kick-Heart, which was lauded as the first anime funded through Kickstarter. From a creative and production standpoint, what were the biggest differences in working on something funded through Kickstarter versus your more traditional projects?


Masaaki Yuasa: With Kickstarter, everyone is a sponsor. So there was a lot of pressure because there&#39;s so many sponsors. But after I was able to create it, and I was able to meet the backers it was really fun. Like talking to them and getting to know them.
So yeah, because they&#39;re both a fan and audience, in addition to being a sponsor, it was really interesting to see their point of view. Sometimes, like when I go overseas to a convention or event, like a film festival, I do see fans who wear Kick-Heart shirts.





Speaking of fans, I think your work inspires so much passion in people because there&#39;s just nothing else like it. What is the most heartwarming interaction you&#39;ve had with a fan?


Masaaki Yuasa: There was something like a heartwarming interaction, but I&#39;m so sorry. I can&#39;t remember. . . But I do think the best part about creating a movie is seeing the audience&#39;s reaction when you show it. So for we&#39;ve had some screenings where we showed it outside in a very casual environment while the audience was drinking beer and I had a lot of fun. Watching that or watching the audience was great.


There are a lot of creators who have trouble looking back at their work. Do you ever re-watch your watch your movies? Or are you the kind of creator who&#39;s always thinking ahead to their next project?


Masaaki Yuasa: I don&#39;t actually rewatch them a lot. Sometimes, when there&#39;s like festivals or events, I do get a chance to rewatch something from the past. For example, I rewatched Mind Game recently at an event, and I&#39;d look at some scenes and think, &#39;Oh, hey, that was done really well&#39;. But I&#39;ll also feel like, &#39;Oh, shoot, I could have done something better over there&#39;. So, my feelings when I watch aren&#39;t really consistent. But every time I have a new project and when it&#39;s released, I do have some regrets, like, &#39;Oh, I wish I could have done this. I could have done this&#39;.
But then when I watch the audience and they have a lot of fun watching my movies that makes me really happy. That makes it worth it.
