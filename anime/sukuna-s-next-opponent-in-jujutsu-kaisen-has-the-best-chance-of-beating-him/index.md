## Literature Review

Although Ryomen Sukuna has faced off against some of history’s most powerful sorcerers, he’s never encountered someone like the God of Lightning.





Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Ryomen Sukuna should take a minute to enjoy the moment of doing the unthinkable and taking down one of the greatest sorcerers ever, Gojo, but his problems are far from over. His next opponent - the God of Lightning, Hajime Kashimo - has been waiting for centuries for a chance to face off against the King of Curses.




Hajime Kashimo AKA the God of Lightning is an ancient sorcerer who became so good with his abilities that he began a long quest to find and fight the purported strongest sorcerers in the land. Eventually, he killed them all. That was about the time he ran into Kenjaku, who made him an offer he could not refuse. Indeed, as revealed in Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter #187, Kenjaku offered Kashimo the chance to fight Sukuna - who he thought was the strongest sorcerer ever - if he agreed to Kenjaku&#39;s grand plan to bring back the Golden Age of Sorcerers. That was over 400 years ago. But now, with Gojo&#39;s unexpected death, Kashimo has the chance to continue his quest to be the best sorcerer by taking out Sukuna.

 Hajime Crossed The Centuries For A Chance To Fight Sukuna 
          




Hajime is more than well-prepared. At present, Hajime offers the Gojo&#39;s team the best chance to win and that should give Sukuna a reason for concern. Like Gojo, Hajime was the greatest sorcerer of his time. With the new, younger body Kenjaku found for him, he&#39;s the most healthy and fit he&#39;s been. In fact, when Hajime first met Kenjaku, his old age was already starting to fail him. Moreover, since he&#39;s been looking forward to the fight as the last chance to fulfill a youthful wish, it&#39;s more than likely he has well practiced ways to take Sukuna out. Indeed, Sukuna lived 600 years before Hajime, so the latter will know his history and abilities. In addition, having just watched Sukuna fight Gojo - he&#39;s certainly taken note on his technique and style.



 Hajime&#39;s Best Technique Is Still A Mystery 
          




Outside of his mental preparation for the fight, Hajime relies on a combination of his otherwordly martial arts skills and his electrified cursed energy manipulation. In his fight with Gojo, Sukuna showed he was susceptible to a vigorous physical attack. Hajime can combine his cursed energy with his physical strikes. Accordingly, every punch, kick, or strike carries with it and electric sock that is guaranteed to cause damage without the need for domain expansion. Even at a distance, Hajime can unleash a lightning strike of unimaginable force, though he&#39;ll need time do draw up his energy between these strikes. Sukuna is also clearly damaged after the incredible fight with Gojo, and he possibly will not have time to heal before the next challenge.

The most powerful of Hajime&#39;s abilities will naturally be his innate cursed technique. However, no one knows what it is yet. As he said in Chapter #190, he can only use it once, and he&#39;s saving it to use against Sukuna. The fact that his innate cursed ability is a mystery provides a tremendous advantage for him. There&#39;s no way that Sukuna can plan for it, or Mahoraga can adjust to it. However, having just watched Sukuna fight Gojo, Hajime certainly knows what monster he&#39;s up against, and yet, he seems fairly confident that his innate cursed technique - whatever it is - will win the day. Indeed, Hajime Kashimo has nothing to lose, which will make his fight against Sukuna another incredibly exciting moment in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s history.
