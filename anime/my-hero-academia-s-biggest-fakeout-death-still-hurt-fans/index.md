## Literature Review

My Hero Academia fans react to the surprise death from chapter 362, while some speculate that it will be reversed when Kohei Horikoshi&#39;s epic returns.




This article contains MAJOR spoilers for My Hero Academia #403!The My Hero Academia fan base was rocked when chapter #362 was released, as Katsuki Bakugo was apparently killed. While fans know now that the death didn&#39;t stick, as Bakugo emerged alive (if not well) in My Hero Academia chapter #403, the initial death had a major impact on readers of the manga. Naturally, fans took to social media at that time to express their reactions to a death in the Class 1-A family.




Bakugo has always been the perfect foil for Deku. Where Izuku Midoriya is humble, respectful, and tolerant, Bakugo is cocky, rude, and close-minded. Prior to Deku gaining his Quirk, Bakugo was one of Midoriya&#39;s primary tormentors. In fact, Bakugo was the first person to ever call Midoriya &#34;Deku,&#34; which loosely translates into &#34;worthless.&#34; However, as he matured both personally and in his relationship with Deku, Bakugo underwent a profound change. While retaining his somewhat objectionable personality, he ultimately developed into one of the most reliable and focused Class 1-A members. That, of course, just made his apparent death at the hands of &#34;Tomura Shigaraki&#34; all the more tragic.


 The Best Reactions to Bakugo&#39;s Death in My Hero Academia 
          

Given his initial bully persona and later development, fan reactions to Bakugo&#39;s death have been both varied and intense. Indeed, many posts highlighted sadness at the thought of losing arguably the most beloved and hated pre-hero in My Hero Academia, especially given his final vision of All Might, which showcased a rare moment of vulnerability.





 


 


 


 


 





 

While there are plenty of villains in My Hero Academia for fans to hate, Bakugo stirred up his fair share of bad feelings as well. Not only was he the definition of a bully, but he was also a bully with superpowers. Moreover, there was also the fact that the main focus of his bullying was Deku, one of the nicest kids around. Since Bakugo was a polarizing hero who did not care about other people&#39;s feelings, it was only natural that a number of posts expressed happiness about the demise of their least favorite character. For this cohort of the fandom, Bakugo was far from redeemed, and there was widespread mockery with reference to other franchises.


 





 


 


 


 

Interestingly, in light of the manga&#39;s well-known tendency to lead fans in one direction with red herrings, only to shock them with a reveal that completely catches them off guard, more than a few fans voiced their disbelief that such an important character would be killed. The intuition of these fans ultimately proved correct, as Bakugo eventually got up and returned to the fight in chapter #403. As these posts from the time of Bakugo&#39;s &#34;death&#34; show, many readers believed it might be another sleight of hand by creator Kohei Horikoshi, like My Hero Academia&#39;s big traitor reveal, to bait fans into thinking he&#39;s dead only to reveal some other outcome.





 


 


 

While ultimately it was revealed that Bakugo wasn&#39;t dead after all, the fake-out certainly had its intended effect, riling up fans and keeping them in suspense for over a year before he finally returned. Those who loved Bakugo were hurt deeply at the thought of the young hero dying so close to the end, while those who dislike his character rejoiced at the thought of being rid of him. Of course, a few fans managed to call it and predict that Bakugo wasn&#39;t really gone after all... even if it took My Hero Academia fans a year to find out they were right.
