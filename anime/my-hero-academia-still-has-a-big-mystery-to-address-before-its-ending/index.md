# My Hero Academia Still Has A Big Mystery To Address Before Its Ending


## SUMMARY 



  My Hero Academia may finally address the mystery surrounding Shigaraki&#39;s unknown friends, Mikkun, Mon, and Tomo.   The recent events in chapter 410 indicate that the series is heading towards its final battle, making it a perfect opportunity to revisit Shigaraki&#39;s tragic past.   Past precedent in the series suggests that flashbacks and origin stories for villains, such as Himiko Toga and Dabi, are not out of place, leading to the possibility of a deeper dive into Shigaraki&#39;s backstory.

## Literature Review

Recent events has put My Hero Academia in a perfect position to finally revisit one of Tomura Shigaraki&#39;s emotional outbursts that demands answers.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia chapter 361!!A compelling mystery that My Hero Academia randomly introduced last year during an exciting battle between Tomura Shigaraki and Lemillion probably won&#39;t be answered before the series concludes, but recent events have created the perfect opportunity for it to happen soon. Fans who recall the moment in question are undoubtedly dying to know more, since it involves My Hero Academia&#39;s most compelling villain and his incredibly tragic backstory.




Way back in chapter #361 of My Hero Academia by Kohei Horikoshi, a comment Lemillion makes about Shigaraki having no friends causes the villain to have a rather violent outburst about how he actually does.

          

The outburst included some unknown but still notable name-drops - Mikkun, Mon and Tomo â€“ that fans had always hoped Shigaraki would expand upon, but the time when it would have been appropriate came and went.

Now is the perfect time for the series to revisit this topic since chapter 410 has finally returned the spotlight to Deku and Shigaraki&#39;s battle after Bakugo&#39;s surprising victory over All For One. Since the series&#39; big bad is now dead, it&#39;s very likely that this chapter marks the beginning of the final battle&#39;s long-awaited conclusion. If Shigaraki is defeated without having the chance to bring up Mikkun, Mon and Tomo again, it would be a big missed opportunity just because Shigaraki&#39;s past is so utterly tragic. Revisiting it would definitely promise something emotional and heartbreaking. Of course, there could always be another flashback without including Mikkun, Mon or Tomo. And even though fans would undoubtedly welcome the continuation of Shigaraki&#39;s origin story in any shape or form, it would definitely be much more effective if My Hero Academia utilizes prior events in the series.




Fans can at least rely on the fact that it wouldn&#39;t be out of place if any kind of flashback happened just based on past precedent. My Hero Academia has already revisited the previously established pasts of many villains. In chapter 341, Himiko Toga has a dream about a time when she was a kid that was undoubtedly triggered by the fact that she had just returned to her childhood home. This unexpected flashback continued her already tragic upbringing revealed much earlier in the series. My Hero Academia did something similar for Dabi. How he shared his initial origin story is undoubtedly the most memorable since he literally announced it to all of Japan during the Paranormal Liberation War. But even more about Dabi&#39;s past is later revealed during his rematch against his brother Shoto in chapter 350. With these examples alone, it isn&#39;t so out of place to assume that the final stage of Deku and Shigaraki&#39;s last battle could lead to a deeper dive into Shigaraki&#39;s past.

          




Even though fans will likely be disappointed in this regard, they can at least take comfort in the fact that Shigaraki&#39;s outburst at Lemillion is meaningful even without the much-desired additional context. It showed how unstable Shigaraki was becoming at the time and that there was still some humanity left in him, confirming what Deku believed when All For One took over Shigaraki. Hopefully, My Hero Academia will prove skeptics wrong, just like it has done countless times before.

My Hero Academia 341 is available on Shonen Jump.

Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
