# Naruto s Evil Version Proves He Was One Tragic Twist Away From Being the Ultimate Villain


## SUMMARY 



  Road To Ninja: Naruto the Movie explores an alternate reality where Naruto is an evil villain named Menma, fueled by hatred and a desire to rule the shinobi world.   Menma&#39;s hatefulness is mentally energizing and gives him access to power-ups and a stronger bond with the Black Nine-Tails, making him even more powerful than Naruto.   Menma&#39;s abilities, combined with his disdain for society, make him one of the most dangerous and powerful characters in the Naruto universe.

## Literature Review

When Naruto turns evil and sets his sights on destroying Konoha, the one shinobi to stop him is himself; but is he capable of facing his own power?




Despite growing up in considerably onerous circumstances, Naruto Uzumaki maintained one of the most positive and wholesome personalities within his cohort of shinobi. Personality-wise, he was too good to be true. This begs the question: what would Naruto have been like if he&#39;d let all the negativity, pain, and loneliness in his life consume him? Interestingly, this question was explored in an alternate Naruto reality, and the short answer it gave - an evil Naruto would be one nasty villain.




In Hayato Date&#39;s Road To Ninja: Naruto the Movie, amid the Konoha struggle against the terrorist organization Akatsuki, Naruto, and Sakura are confronted by Akatsuki member Tobi in a park outside the Konoha village center. However, before they can respond, they are blinded by a bright light. After the light disappears, Tobi is gone. Fearing he&#39;s about to do harm, Naruto and Sakura race back to the village to warn the others. However, it soon becomes clear that they are not in their Konoha anymore.

          

The blinding light they encountered was an Infinite Tsukuyomi spell cast by Tobi to send them into an alternate reality known as Genjutsu World. This reality includes several major differences from the prime Naruto timeline. In this timeline, Naruto&#39;s parents, Minato and Kushino, survived the attack by the Nine-Tails Beast that killed in the prime world. Naturally, this timeline also has a Naruto who, in another key difference, is called Menma and has black, rather than blonde, hair. Immediately before Naruto arrives in Genjutsu, Menma leaves Konoha. Consequently, his parents never realized he was missing. While they feel Naruto&#39;s a bit different - with his new blonde hair - they still think he&#39;s their Menma.






Road To Ninja is not considered canon in Naruto. While Naruto&#39;s creator, Masashi Kishimoto, was connected with the project, it was in a minor capacity. Veteran Naruto anime writer Yuka Miyata wrote the script.





 Menma&#39;s Strength Is Powered By His Hate 
          

The powers that Naruto&#39;s &#34;evil twin&#34; Menma possesses make him staggeringly dangerous, and a menace to society. This is especially true considering his deep-seated hatred of the world. Unlike Naruto, Menma gave into his dark impulses early on. His criminal mentality is based on a disdain for society that he&#39;s nursed quietly since he was a child. The reason he abandoned his village was to pursue his desire to take control of the shinobi world and rule it with a chakra-infused iron fist. Before Naruto&#39;s arrival, he was a few moves away from realizing his dream.




His hatefulness is not an impediment. It is both mentally energizing and physically exhilarating. It gave him access to several &#34;power-ups&#34; that Naruto is unable to use. His hate helps him to develop a more intense relationship with Kurama â€“ the Black Nine-Tails beast living within him. Their mutual inborn abhorrence unlocks access to the beasts&#39; unlimited reserve of chakra energy. This makes Menma stronger while adding a bonus boost to all his techniques and innate abilities.



 Once Unleashed, Menma Would Be Hard To Stop 
          

Menma essentially possessed the same abilities as Naruto but with an evil twist and the added boost of a connected Black Nine-Tails beast. In addition, for years he&#39;s been secretly kidnapping shinobi with Kekkei Genkai and stealing their abilities for himself. Consequently, Menma&#39;s base power level is equivalent to Naruto&#39;s Kurama Chakra Mode One. Due to the bond and trust he&#39;s established with the Black Nine-Tails, Menma is also able to summon the beast when needed, and without the restraints that Boruto applied to his beast. His connection with the Black Nine-Tails beast suggests that he can reach the equivalent of Naruto&#39;s Kurama Chakra Mode Two with ease. In fact, with the additional abilities he&#39;s obtained from his training, he should be able to progress even further past this power level.




With his powers, Menma would rank among the most powerful characters in Naruto. Combined with his contempt for the world, he&#39;d be the ultimate Naruto villain.
