## Literature Review

Like any long-running anime Naruto: Shippuden has many filler episodes. Here’s which episodes can be skipped without missing anything vital.




Naruto: Shippuden is roughly 40% filler, naturally leading potential fans to look for a list of every filler episode. Though Naruto&#39;s best filler episodes can develop the series&#39; world and characters, the same can&#39;t be said for every episode. As great as some of the filler is, it&#39;s easy to see why many fans skip the filler content altogether. Unfortunately, that task might be easier said than done.




For most anime adapting a long-running manga series, the line between filler and not filler can be clear as day. Filler episodes are any episodes that aren&#39;t adapting a manga chapter.



All episodes of Naruto: Shippuden are streaming on Crunchyroll &amp; Hulu.




The problem with Naruto Shippuden is that the lines between filler and not filler are blurred, as many episodes of the beloved series mix filler content into manga-canon content, making everything just that much more frustrating for those who want to avoid filler. Still, though some episodes mix filler content with canon content, Naruto: Shippuden still has its fair share of pure filler for fans to look out for.

                  Naruto: What Does &#39;Shippuden&#39; Actually Mean?   Naruto: Shippuden is the animated version of the latter half of the famous manga series. This leaves fans asking, what exactly does &#39;Shippuden&#39; mean?   





 Every Filler Episode of Naruto: Shippuden 
  Episode #   Episode or Arc Title    28   Beasts! Alive Again!    57 – 71   Twelve Guardian Ninja    89 – 112   Three-Tails’ Appearance    144 – 151   Six-Tails Unleashed    170 – 171   Big Adventure! The Quest for the Fourth Hokage&#39;s Legacy    176 - 196   Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha    223 – 242   Paradise Life on a Boat    257 – 260   Naruto &amp; Sasuke flashback mini arc    271   Road to Sakura    279 – 281   Fourth Shinobi World War side stories    284 – 295   Fourth Shinobi World War side stories    303 – 320   Fourth Shinobi World War side stories    347 – 361   Kakashi: Shadow of the ANBU Black Ops    376   The Directive to Take the Nine Tails    377   Naruto Vs. Mecha Naruto    388   My First Friend    389   The Adored Elder Sister    390   Hanabi&#39;s Decision    394 – 413   In Naruto&#39;s Footsteps: The Friends&#39; Paths    416    The Formation of Team Minato    417   You&#39;ll Be My Backup    422 - 428   Birth of the Ten-Tails&#39; Jinchūriki side stories    429 – 430   Killer B Rappūden    431   To See That Smile, Just One More Time    432 – 450   Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero    464 - 468   Ashura and Indra Arc    480 - 483   Childhood   






All in all, filler accounts for 206 episodes out of the Naruto: Shippuden&#39;s 500 episodes. Though not quite half, that still accounts for 41% of the entire series. Looking at the list completely, it&#39;s easy to see where the team behind the anime ran into speed bumps when adapting the manga with the series mostly avoiding filler until around the hundred-episode mark, where things get a bit more dire. Both Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden are infamous for their filler content, with the original series also having around 40% of its episodes be filler.



 Are Any of Naruto: Shippuden&#39;s Filler Arcs Worth Watching? 
          

While Shippuden is filled with some truly dreadful filler such as the Paradise Life on a Boat Arc and the infamous Naruto Vs. Mecha Naruto episode, not all of Shippuden&#39;s filler is bad. Though there are several standout episodes and moments, the easiest one to recommend is the Kakashi: Shadow of the ANBU Black Ops mini-arc. Kakashi is an important character, and this mini-arc contains many important pieces of information about his time in the Anbu. If fans only watch one piece of filler content from Naruto: Shippuden it should be Kakashi&#39;s Anbu arc.






All of Naruto&#39;s movies are technically filler except for The Last: Naruto the Movie, which works as a good epilogue to the series.




Though many fans bemoan the abundance of filler, and some of it is genuinely poor quality, it is still an important part of Naruto: Shippuden and its legacy. Modern Shonen anime adaptations such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen may have abandoned filler arcs altogether, but they can actually be effective if used well. Even at their worst, Naruto: Shippuden&#39;s filler episodes don&#39;t do any harm as they&#39;re easy to skip and rarely have any impact on the series&#39; overarching plot. Fans of Naruto: Shippuden may want to skip most of the series&#39; filler, but some of it truly does shine.
