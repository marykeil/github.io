## SUMMARY 



  Chapter #1099 of One Piece may have provided a hint about Dragon&#39;s powers and his Devil Fruit, suggesting he has the ability to manipulate wind and weather.   The Japanese version&#39;s use of a special font when Dragon mentions the winds of fate further supports the theory that Dragon has a wind-related Devil Fruit.

Summary

  Chapter #1099 of One Piece may have provided a hint about Dragon&#39;s powers and his Devil Fruit, suggesting he has the ability to manipulate wind and weather.   The Japanese version&#39;s use of a special font when Dragon mentions the winds of fate further supports the theory that Dragon has a wind-related Devil Fruit.   Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit could be a Logia-type or a mythical Zoan-type, both of which would grant him formidable powers and contribute to his ability to control the weather.  







One Piece has yet again teased the powers of one of its most enigmatic characters, the head of the Revolutionary Army and Luffy&#39;s father, Dragon. Among the many characters of One Piece, few have remained as mysterious as Dragon, whose intentions and powers have eluded fans for hundreds of chapters. That said, the latest chapter may have finally given them a hint about Dragon&#39;s powers and his Devil Fruit.

Fans have long speculated that Dragon possesses a Devil Fruit that allows him to manipulate the wind and weather. Chapter #1099 of One Piece goes on to fuel this theory as Dragon curiously mentions &#34;the winds of fate&#34; as he speaks with Kuma.

          

Though Dragon&#39;s words may seem unassuming at first glance, a brief look at his appearances in the series thus far suggests they may hold a deeper meaning that&#39;s been in the making since Dragon&#39;s introduction in chapter #100.





 One Piece Hints At Dragon&#39;s Abilities After 1000 Chapters 
Dragon&#39;s first appearance was in chapter #100, published originally in 1999.
          

In chapter #99, when Luffy is saved by a lightning strike, Smoker notes how some force seems to be aiding his survival and escape. Smoker also notices the wind seems to be blowing in just the right direction for his sails to catch the wind and escape swiftly. The subsequent chapter then hints that Dragon was responsible for the odd weather as he appears on the scene when the wind blows away countless Marines in pursuit of the Straw Hats. Clearly, all evidence points to Luffy&#39;s father being able to control the wind, suggesting his line in chapter #1099 may have been an intended pun.


 




As X user @sandman_AP points out, another hint that Dragon&#39;s words may hold more meaning stems from the original Japanese version where Oda uses a different font specifically for Dragon&#39;s line about the winds of fate. The choice to draw attention to it in this way seems intentional as a way to fuel speculation about Dragon&#39;s wind powers. The only possible source of such power in the world of One Piece would be a Devil Fruit, and considering Dragon was once a marine, it would not be difficult for him to acquire such a powerful Devil Fruit, especially if he made it to the rank of Vice Admiral as popularly theorized.



 Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit Could Be a Logia or a Zoan 
          

Many of the Vice Admirals infamously possess formidable Devil Fruit powers, and Dragon would fit right in if his fruit is indeed a Logia-type. Having witnessed the state of Punk Hazard following the battle between Akainu and Aokiji, it would certainly be possible for Dragon to control the weather of an area as large as Loguetown with the powers of a Logia.




Having said that, according to another popular theory going around since the release of chapter #1099, Dragon&#39;s Devil Fruit could also be a Mythical Zoan, one related to the Thunderbird, a legendary creature of Native American folklore, capable of controlling the weather. Mythical Zoans are without a doubt some of the strongest Devil Fruits in One Piece, and considering the other Zoan users introduced into the story, such as Saint Saturn and the Five Elders, it would come as no surprise for Dragon to be among them.

Overall, Luffy&#39;s father is evidently being set up to play a major role in the finale of the series, though what that role will be and when Dragon will finally re-enter the story in the present is yet to be seen. Nonetheless, One Piece seems to have set the stage for an epic revelation of Dragon&#39;s true powers, whenever that may be.

One Piece is available from Viz Media and Manga Plus.
