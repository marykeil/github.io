## Literature Review

New yaoi fans should start their journey with Sasaki and Miyano as they set out on their love story together, navigating uncharted waters.




Anime fans who are new to yaoi and don&#39;t know where to start should try the romcom series Sasaki and Miyano that debuted on Crunchyroll last year. Like newcomers to the genre, the series&#39; titular protagonists are also new to being in a relationship with another boy, so the plunge into the actual romance is also much more prolonged. Interestingly, Sasaki is a newcomer to yaoi literature as well.




Adapted from the original manga by Shō Harusono, Sasaki and Miyano differs from traditional anime romcoms in that the viewer gets full access to both characters&#39; innermost thoughts, giving a newer perspective for new fans of boys&#39; love on not just this specific sub-genre, but the romance anime genre as a whole. While a breath of fresh air, this excellent mode of storytelling allows viewers to see each boy&#39;s entire journey into the unknown in depth as they discover that they do have feelings for each other. The question that most anime romcoms don&#39;t answer about how one of the characters actually feels about the other is not what&#39;s important in Sasaki and Miyano.

Rather appropriately, the respective journeys of both Sasaki and Miyano are very different, providing a much more comprehensive view of what a closeted gay person can experience. While Sasaki realizes his feelings much more quickly than Miyano, his original hesitation is covered. He clearly thinks Miyano is cute, but he&#39;s almost sure that he&#39;s a girl, allowing him to question for at least a short time whether he actually has feelings for another guy. Once realized, Sasaki&#39;s struggles come down to a game of dropping hints and seeing how far he can go without scaring Miyano away. Interestingly, Sasaki somehow assumes the more dominant role even though he&#39;s completely new to these feelings and to yaoi literature, unlike Miyano, who is a yaoi connoisseur.




Miyano&#39;s journey is much more complex, as he&#39;s clearly been flirting with his sexual preferences but channeling it exclusively to yaoi manga, especially one series in particular called BL. So, even though he&#39;s highly knowledgeable about certain types of characters and is even able to clearly understand the dynamics of real-life gay relationships as a result, Miyano is surprisingly even less experienced than Sasaki, as he is more dead set on separating what he feels is only fiction from reality.

Sasaki and Miyano also explores each boys&#39; romantic journey through core themes presented throughout the series. Their conflicting preferences for sweet and unsweetened foods serve as a gauge of how they actually feel for each other. After pushing away certain types of food, the two are eventually able to make concessions for the other and attempt to share and gift each other different types to express how important the other is to them.




Their relationship is also defined by their shared love of yaoi manga. As the more experienced and voracious reader of the genre, Miyano gets excited over the prospect of sharing his passion for literature with someone else, while allowing himself to skirt even closer around the edges of a way of life he is so hesitant to embrace. Meanwhile, Sasaki uses this mutual interest as an excuse to get closer to Miyano and is able to channel his frustrations by talking about same-sex relationships with the very person he wants to be in one with. The unique way in which they trade volumes is also a stunning metaphor for how closeted people feel about sharing their true feelings in general, adding another layer to the already highly nuanced show.

Overall, those who are new to yaoi are highly encouraged to start their journey on Crunchyroll with Sasaki and Miyano as both protagonists embark on a new beautiful adventure together of their own.
