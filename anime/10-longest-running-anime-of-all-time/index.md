## Literature Review

Anime like One Piece and Detective Conan have been airing for decades and have episode counts in the thousands. Which series have been around longest?




The title of longest-running anime is a surprisingly difficult question to answer, if only because there are so many anime that have continuously aired episodes for decades. As long-running favorites such as One Piece and Case  d (also known as Detective Conan) sail past the thousand-episode mark, viewers marvel at the staying power of anime.
Whether these series and franchises are some of the most famous of all time, such as One Piece, or more obscure to Western fans like Crayon Shin-chan, they all have something that has kept audiences coming back to them for decades. Other anime come and go, but these series have stood the test of time.









 








 10  One Piece 1999 - Present, 24 Years Airing 
Animated By Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Eiichiro Oda


 







An all-time favorite worldwide, One Piece is based on one of the longest-running manga ever. It is a faithful adaptation with very little filler. Just before his execution, the world&#39;s most notorious pirate, Gol D. Roger, declared that he has hidden his ultimate treasure, the One Piece. Whoever completes the impossible quest and finds the treasure will become the new Pirate King.
As Eiichiro Oda&#39;s manga is still ongoing with no signs of stopping yet, it may well overtake some currently longer anime in the near future. One Piece&#39;s anime began in 1999 and has since produced 1090 episodes at the time of writing. Time will only tell how far Luffy and the Straw Hats&#39; story will have stretched when it finally ends.

 9  Ojarumaru 1998 - Present, 25 Year Airing 
Animated By Gallop &amp; Created By Rin Inumaru
        

In a strange reverse isekai story, Ojarmaru follows a 5-year-old prince from ancient Japan who falls into a portal that leaves him stranded in present-day Japan. As with most other long-running anime, Ojarmaru is a kids anime with a delightfully juvenile sense of humor. Episode plots typically involve the titular prince being pursued by a trio of oni siblings also sent from the past who are after a powerful scepter Ojarmaru stole. While adult fans may not find much compelling about the series, it&#39;s clearly earned its place in anime history, as Ojarmaru started in 1998 and has gone on to run for an impressive 2,037 episodes.





 8  Doraemon 1979 - 2005, 26 Years Airing 
Animated By Shin-Ei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Fujiko F. Fujio
        

Doraemon has long been a staple of the anime medium, with several series bearing the name running for long stretches of time. The 1979 series in particular, however, has managed to garner the longest tenure of the franchise. The 1979 rendition of Doraemon ran for twenty-six years and aired over 1,700 episodes before coming to an end in 2005. Though the series is still far from the longest-running anime&#39;s episode count, the total amount of episodes in the entire Doraemon pantheon is over 3,000.





 7  Pokémon - 1997 - Present, 27 Years Airing 
Animated By OLM &amp; Based on the Video Game Franchise Created By Satoshi Tajiri


 







So long as Pokémon games keep getting made, new seasons of the anime will keep on coming. The young Trainer Ash Ketchum and his partner Pikachu travel through region after region, catching new Pokémon, making new friends, and winning battle after battle in hopes of becoming a Pokémon Master. The show continues to be a hit worldwide among audiences of all ages, with Pikachu being a favorite in many countries. While its stakes aren&#39;t exactly high, it&#39;s bright, optimistic, and more than fun enough to keep viewers coming back for more.
While Pokemon technically consists of multiple series, these individual series are much more like seasons of a show rather than something entirely new.


Ash&#39;s run in the anime ended after 1,232 episodes and 25 years, but a new future for the series has already begun with Pokémon Horizons. Taking into account the new series, Pokemon anime has produced 1,269 episodes since its premiere in 1997​​​​​.

 6  Case  d 1996 - Present, 28 Years Airing 
Animated By TMS Entertainment &amp; Based on the Manga By Gosho Aoyama
        

Shinichi Kudo is a brilliant young detective, already assisting seasoned police on big cases with his lightning-fast analyses. However, with success comes enemies: two criminals attack Shinichi and force-feed him experimental poison. Instead of killing him, the poison turns him into a child, forcing him to adopt a new identity as he continues to try and solve crimes.
It&#39;s a testament to the strength of the show&#39;s writing that viewers are still tuning into Shinichi&#39;s latest cases even as they number over one thousand. Case  d began in 1996 and has since produced 1110 episodes. While a running thread is Shinichi&#39;s attempt to return to his old body, Case  d is largely episodic.

 5  Chibi Maruko-Chan 1995 - Present, 29 Years Airing 
Animated By Nippon Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Momoko Sakura
        

Chibi Maruko-chan might technically be a single-season anime, but it will be harder to marathon than the average 12- or 24-episode season. With an episode count well into the thousands, it would take over three weeks to finish the whole thing. Maruko-chan started in 1995 and has since encompassed a staggering 1,417 episodes.
An adaptation of one of the most famous shoujo manga, the children&#39;s show follows Momoko &#34;Maruko&#34; Sakura and her family and friends. It is lighthearted and cute, and is good for both older viewers who are feeling nostalgic and younger viewers who want something simple.





 4  Nintama Rantarō 1993 - Present, 31 Years Airing 
Animated By Ajia-do Animation Works &amp; Based on the Manga By Sōbe Amako
        

As well-known Japanese broadcaster NHK&#39;s longest-running program, it&#39;s no surprise that Nintama Rantarō is also one of the longest-running anime. The series is about a first-grade boy named Rantarō who attends a ninja school alongside his best friends Kirimaru and Shinbee. Another comedy-based anime aimed at a younger audience, the series revels in references to Japanese culture. Since it started airing in 1993, Nintama Rantarō has aired 2,321 10-minute segments.





 3  Crayon Shin-chan 1992 - Present, 32 Years Airing 
Animated By Shin-Ei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Yoshito Usui
        

A slice-of-life anime with some of the most ridiculous character designs in anime, Crayon Shin-chan follows five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara. A typical troublemaking kid, Shin causes untold amounts of mischief around his hometown with his friends. The series is still airing in Japan, and multiple attempts have been made to dub it in English, though each is mostly incomplete. All the English dubs take considerable liberties with the source material, such as the Vitello Productions dub by adding in even more dirty jokes to an already lewd show.
Crayon Shin-Chan&#39;s anime started in 1992 and has so far produced 1,200 episodes. The series&#39; juvenile sense of humor has proven quite popular in Japan, more than earning Shin-Chan its incredible staying power.





 2  Soreike! Anpanman 1988 - Present, 35 Years Airing 
Animated By TMS Entertainment &amp; Based on the Children&#39;s Book By Takashi Yanase
        

Sorieke! Anpanman follows the adventures of the bean-headed eponymous children&#39;s superhero Anpanman as he battles evil, including the nefarious germ Baikinman. The series is a cultural staple of Japan, with Anpanman becoming one of the most recognizable original characters from Japanese pop culture. Due to the main character&#39;s prominence in Japanese popular culture, Sorieke! Anpanman has enjoyed a lengthy run as a television series. Beginning its tenure in 1988, Anpanman still continues to this day, with 1,572 episodes.





 1  Sazae-San 1969 - Present, 53 Years Airing 
Animated By Eiken &amp; Based on the Manga By Machiko Hasegawa
        

Sazae-san doesn&#39;t just outstrip every anime in history in terms of library and longevity, but it is one of the longest-running TV shows of all time, soundly beating heavy hitters like The Simpsons and Doctor Who. It even holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running television animated show ever. Sazae-San started in 1969 and now contains over 2,640 episodes.
The show chronicles the daily lives of housewife Sazae Fuguta and her family, and it is beloved in Japan for its portrayal of a wholesome Japanese lifestyle, with many families still tuning in every Sunday night. It is such a cultural staple that &#34;Sazae-san syndrome&#34; is the recognized term in Japan for depression caused by the end of the weekend and the impending start of a new workweek. With its cultural influence and simple appeal, it&#39;s no wonder that Sazae-San is the longest-running anime in history.
