Summary

  Imu&#39;s true power is revealed through the destruction of Lulusia, showcasing their terrifying abilities.   The anime&#39;s visual effects create a sinister aura around Imu, enhancing their menacing presence. The true destructive power of their secret weapon, the Mother Flame, is also showcased to the full extent with added scenes.   Imu is established as the ultimate adversary for Luffy in the Final Saga, representing the biggest evils in One Piece.  







One Piece&#39;s biggest, most ominous villain, Imu, made their appearance in the anime, which showcased the true extent of their terrifying presence and the destructive power of their secret weapon, the Mother Flame. Imu could very well be the Straw Hats&#39; final foe, and the anime did a great job of establishing their presence with a terrifying display of power.

Episode #1089 of One Piece makes Imu more menacing than ever, revealing the true extent of their power with the shocking destruction of Lulusia using the Mother Flame. While the manga did not spend much time showing the destructive power of the Mother Flame, the anime more accurately puts into perspective the extent of the destruction caused by a seemingly nonchalant decision by Imu, who ominously crosses out the island on a map.

         




The anime also accentuates the chilling aftermath of Lulusia&#39;s destruction and the sheer size of the gaping hole in the sea marking the spot where the kingdom once existed. Not only does the episode boost the intrigue surrounding Imu&#39;s character, but also raises the stakes for the upcoming adaptation of the Egghead Arc and the Final Saga.

                  One Piece Hints At The Real Reason Its World Is Covered In Oceans   Imu&#39;s latest actions in One Piece could explain why its world is so unusual, and the reason why it is mostly covered by water.   


 One Piece Reveals The True Power Of Imu&#39;s Secret Weapon Using Great Visual Effects 
          

Having last appeared only briefly in episode #885, the latest episode re-awakens the intrigue surrounding Imu, who is teased to be the secret head of the Five Elders, and, by extension, the World Government. Despite being introduced in a bright room full of flowers and butterflies, episode #1089 quickly proves Imu is far from a serene, gentle leader, with the scene of Lulusia&#39;s destruction acting as a sharp contrast to the flowery room in Mariejois.




          

Though the series has yet to reveal Imu&#39;s true appearance, episode #1089 does a wonderful job of expanding on the few panels of their shadowy silhouette from the manga with the careful use of visual effects such as vignettes, distortion, and an ominous score, which together contribute to crafting Imu&#39;s sinister aura. More impressive is the destruction of Lulusia caused by the Mother Flame, with the anime showing exactly how the weapon functions: releasing a barrage of massive, destructive energy beams that annihilate everything below it.



 
While their true powers remain unknown, it is clear that Imu will play a major role in the Final Saga as the tyrannical leader of the World Government against whom Luffy has declared war multiple times throughout the series. Given Luffy&#39;s track record of overthrowing evil tyrants and his subsequent awakening as the warrior of liberation, Imu stands as the ultimate adversary, representing the despicable Celestial Dragons and the biggest evils in One Piece.






 One Piece Introduces a Foe Worthy of Going Up Against Gear Five 
          

There&#39;s also the matter of Imu&#39;s suspected connection to Joyboy due to the giant straw hat seen at Mariejois in episode #885, which further paints Imu as Luffy&#39;s final opponent. Of course, considering the mind-boggling capabilities of Gear Five, Imu would have to possess a devil fruit ability just as fearsome, which the silhouette seen in chapter #1086 suggests could be true. Nevertheless, the terrifying portrayal of Imu in the latest episode proves fans can expect One Piece&#39;s anime to remain just as exceptional as the Wano Arc going forward.
