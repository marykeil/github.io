## Literature Review

The new Rasengan Uzuhiko seen in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #2 may have been explained in an important &#34;filler&#34; episode in the Boruto anime.





After Code suddenly surprise attacks Konoha, Boruto appears out of nowhere to save Sarada from the villain. Fighting quickly ensues and soon afterward Boruto announces the name of a new attack called Rasengan Uzuhiko at the end of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #2. Although he appears to be surrounded by either Wind chakra or aura, there&#39;s no Rasengan in his hand, meaning it could be a variation of his signature Vanishing Rasengan, based on Lightning Release. In other words, Rasengan Uzuhiko could be a combination of his Vanishing Rasengan and a Wind Style: Rasengan that Boruto tried (and failed) to master in the anime under the guidance of Kakashi.





 Kakashi Helped Boruto Develop His New Rasengan 
          

In episode #168 of the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime, Boruto undergoes training with Kakashi to improve his Rasegan, which had failed during an earlier fight, and he felt responsible for Mitsuki getting injured as a result. When Boruto shows Kakashi his Vanishing Rasegan, Kakashi reveals that it uses Lightning chakra and, since it was incomplete, suggests that Boruto try to incorporate Wind chakra into the Rasengan instead. However, the technique was incomplete, and it lacked the incredible destructive power that Naruto&#39;s Wind Rasengan had.

          




However, what Rasengan Uzuhiko looks like in Two Blue Vortex suggests that Boruto may have attempted to complete what Kakashi had told him was an incomplete jutsu and then combine it with the other Rasengan. In the anime, Boruto was already shown using two different nature transformations at the same time thanks to his Shadow Clones, so this could be a natural step forward. Since Two Blue Vortex takes place three years after the final chapter of Naruto Next Generations, it&#39;s highly probable that Boruto used those three years to complete the Vanishing Rasengan and then combine it with his Wind Style: Rasengan, but this would&#39;t have been possible without Kakashi.



 The Rasengan Uzuhiko Should Be The Result of Kakashi in the Boruto Anime, But Not The Manga 
          

Unfortunately, the training under Kakashi happened only in the anime, so it&#39;s very unlikely that Two Blue Vortex will attempt to explain the true origins of the attack. There are any instances of this where the manga has no choice but to conveniently avoid what it perplexingly skipped but the anime covered. As a result, only anime watchers have been able to fully enjoy some specific plot lines, including the important role that Sumire could play in this sequel. For the sake of those who haven&#39;t watched the Boruto anime, hopefully Boruto: Two Blue Vortex will at least mention Kakashi&#39;s role in helping develop the new Rasengan Uzuhiko, if this turns out to be the case.




Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is available from Viz Media.
