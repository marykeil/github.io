  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The most relatable characters in Haikyu!! deal with complicated emotions that many viewers can relate to in other aspects of their life.</p>
<p>The anime adaptation of Haikyu!! boasts a large ensemble cast, all of which have their own unique stories and difficulties they grapple with as the series goes on. These emotional struggles are the result of fundamentally human qualities that they possess and often lead to powerful moments of character growth. It&rsquo;s these empathetic qualities that viewers can recognize in themselves and others that ultimately lend even more power to Haikyu!!&rsquo;s story.
The most relatable characters in Haikyu!! may not initially seem like people that audiences will connect with. However, the careful unraveling of these individuals&rsquo; distinctive stories and insight into how they overcome the obstacles in their path mean that, even in the smallest ways, fans can see themselves in them.</p>
<p>10  Asahi Azumane Speaks To Fans Who Doubt Themselves
Asahi proves that personal growth is a steady process</p>
<p>Asahi is introduced early on in the series as the member of Karasuno who played Hinata&rsquo;s most coveted position: the ace. Already a nervous individual, Asahi&rsquo;s self-confidence plummeted after a particularly trying match against the defense of their rival Date Tech High School. When their defense proved insurmountable and none of Asahi&rsquo;s spikes made it over, Asahi quickly placed the blame on himself and, toward the end of said game, no longer called for additional tosses. This decision, made on behalf of his dwindling self-confidence, eventually spurred on an argument with his teammate, Nishinoya, that eventually caused both of them to end up leaving the team.
Although Asahi does rejoin the team with Nishinoya, he still frequently struggles with his anxieties and self-worth. However, his friends are always there to remind him that he&rsquo;s not playing the game alone and that a loss is not the end of the road. His personal growth throughout the series focuses on overcoming his anxieties and often, most importantly, continuing forward in spite of them. He learns not to let anxiety stop him from doing something he loves with his friends – a lesson that many can relate to.</p>
<p>9  Kenma Kozume Is Reserved, But Analytical
Kenma&rsquo;s character arc is an example of never judging a book by its cover</p>
<p>Kenma is portrayed to viewers as a very reserved individual who keeps to himself and doesn&rsquo;t always feel comfortable interacting with others. Due to his quiet nature, he doesn&rsquo;t appear to have many friends. Audiences learn that his enthusiasm comes from his hobbies, including video games and eventually volleyball, which he was introduced to by his friend Kuroo. Despite seeming apathetic, Kenma does grow to enjoy playing and appreciates the connections that he makes with other players.
His approach to volleyball is very analytical, and his aforementioned reserved nature can give people the impression that he doesn&rsquo;t care about others. However, it&rsquo;s just the opposite. Kenma tends to be very observant and also concerned with how other people view him.</p>
<p>8  Shoyo Hinata
Haikyu&rsquo;s protagonist displays unwavering ambition</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Hinata a great shonen protagonist is that he&rsquo;s not perfect. He&rsquo;s always had an enthusiasm for volleyball, but due to living in a small town, was only actually able to become part of a team during his later middle school years. He learns a lot of lessons the hard way, which can be sometimes be difficult for him to process, but it never ultimately kills his love of the sport and his desire to become the team&rsquo;s ace.
It&rsquo;s satisfying to watch him succeed, partly because of what he&rsquo;s been through to get there and his passion for achieving his specific goals. Sometimes the areas where he lacks get in the way of his being able to continue pursuing his passion, and he tends to focus on that above anything else. His inability to let his obstacles ultimately deter him shows an admirable dedication that many can relate to or want to strive for.</p>
<p>7  Tobio Kageyama
A determined volleyball player who struggles to express himself</p>
<p>Kageyama initially comes off as an arrogant and short-tempered individual who frequently brings up his teammates&rsquo; shortcomings on the court and bosses them around. However, viewers discover that the setter simply gets frustrated and doesn&rsquo;t know the best way to communicate his emotions, which leads to him lashing out. In the past, this caused his teammates to view him as a tyrant and refuse to work alongside him on the court, something that the audience realize he deeply regrets. Kageyama is very passionate about volleyball and shows incredible dedication towards improvement, in spite of these setbacks.
When he first joins Karasuno, things start off rocky due to him and Hinata butting heads. But, over time, he grew to understand his teammates more and recognize the importance of teamwork and trust on the court. He allows himself to trust in the judgment of his teammates and to, consequently, become the kind of player they can count on as well. He also shows a lot of progress in his ability to communicate concerns with those around him.</p>
<p>6  Kei Tsukishima
An antagonistic force with a fear of passion</p>
<p>From the beginning, viewers get a sense of Tsukishima&rsquo;s antagonistic nature, especially in regard to specific members of the team. He&rsquo;s far more composed and quite smug compared to some of his more outgoing teammates on Karasuno, and often gives the impression that he&rsquo;s indifferent to volleyball. This attitude is revealed to partly stem from low self-esteem and his experiences with volleyball in the past. When he was young, he looked up to his older brother Akiteru and his passion for volleyball. Despite how much his brother loved volleyball, he never actually ended up playing as a starter on the team, which Tsukishima accidentally discovers one day. This discovery plays a huge role in his decision to abstain from putting too much effort and emotion into volleyball.
Tsukishima is hesitant to be passionate about something because he&rsquo;s afraid he&rsquo;ll end up being broken by it, like his brother was. He recognizes that passion in other people and it frustrates him. It seemed much easier, in his mind, not to care in the first place. However, he becomes motivated by the sport again after some meaningful conversations with friends and finds it more enjoyable after an explosive moment on the court against the intimidating Shiratorizawa.</p>
<p>5  Hitoka Yachi
A character arc that focuses on discovering oneself</p>
<p>Yachi joins Karasuno as a co-manager under Kiyoko&rsquo;s tutelage in the second season of Haikyu!!. She appears as a nervous girl who is easily intimidated and uncertain about the role she plays within the team. However, she gradually becomes more certain of herself as the series goes on. Her appreciation for volleyball and the passion that Karasuno&rsquo;s team has for it increased over time, as well as her developing knowledge of the sport.
She definitely seems to struggle with her own feelings of self-worth, which viewers witness toward the beginning of her time on the show. She joins Karasuno as a manager, but isn&rsquo;t certain she has much to offer. After overhearing a conversation about the team needing to make money for a potential training camp in Tokyo, she is motivated to help by creating flyers inviting people to donate locally. These flyers end up being successful and, after some conversations with others and her continued witnessing of Karasuno&rsquo;s enthusiasm and passion, she eventually becomes more certain of her decision to be part of the team. Her hesitation and uncertainty in the face of her new path are understandable and most people struggle with self-worth throughout their life.</p>
<p>4  Koshi Sugawara
Karasuno offers a constant support system for the team</p>
<p>Sugawara is Karasuno&rsquo;s third-year setter, a gentle and consistent presence who serves as a strong player in the team&rsquo;s support. Throughout the series, Sugawara continues to show his passion for playing volleyball with the rest of Karasuno and his determination to improve. He does, however, experience moments of doubt. Prior to the start of the series, when Karasuno lost to Date Tech High School, Sugawara blamed himself for the loss. From time to time, he seems to struggle with belief in himself as a setter, especially in the face of Kageyama&rsquo;s natural talents. Eventually, though, he finds his motivation again and, despite not beginning as a starting regular, continues to encourage his teams and seek improvement and the chance to be on the court whenever he can.</p>
<p>3  Yu Nishinoya
One of the hardest workers in Haikyu!!</p>
<p>Nishinoya is the energetic, hardworking libero of the Karasuno team who never seems content with being good enough. In spite of his boisterous and excitable demeanor off the court, he becomes exceptionally focused and calm once the game starts. A fundamental cog in the machine that is Karasuno&rsquo;s support, Nishinoya strives to help his team until the very end.
There&rsquo;s no doubting Nishinoya&rsquo;s passion for the sport, which comes through in a variety of ways, including his eventual willingness to develop his skills outside the role of being the team&rsquo;s libero. He seems to have pride in his ability, but is also shown to be frequently looking for ways to improve. As mentioned, he doesn&rsquo;t seem satisfied with leaving things as is and his enthusiasm and lively personality mean that, as long as he remains unsatisfied, he&rsquo;ll continue moving forward.</p>
<p>2  Chikara Ennoshita
A leader struggling to do his best</p>
<p>Ennoshita is a second year on the Karasuno team who eventually becomes captain in his third year. He serves to balance out the more outgoing and energetic members of the team, particularly Tanaka and Nishinoya, by reeling them in when necessary. His biggest internal struggle seems to be in regards to his experience on court, since he doesn&rsquo;t start as often as many of the others. He wrestles with that conflict, especially when he subs in for Daichi during Karasuno&rsquo;s match against Wakutani Minami.
In the past, Ennoshita ended up leaving the volleyball club due to the former coach Ukai&rsquo;s intense training. Though, once he and some of his fellow teammates realized how much they missed playing it, they rejoined and promised to do their best from that point on. This seems to be a decision that Ennoshita regrets, evidenced by the fact that he and the other second years ended up calling themselves &ldquo;The Ungrateful Second Years&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s likely that this regret plays a role in his confidence. However, his potential as a captain more than speaks for itself and earns him the admirable role in his third year.</p>
<p>1  Keishin Ukai
Wears his passionate nature on his sleeve, regardless of his past</p>
<p>Ukai is Karasuno&rsquo;s coach, who initially worked at the local Sakanoshita Market. Due to his own experience playing volleyball in high school, he seems very knowledgeable about the sport and in spite of his initial reluctance to coach, becomes quite invested in the happiness and success of the team. Although he claims in the beginning that he doesn&rsquo;t want to do it because he doesn&rsquo;t want to end up babysitting a bunch of kids, he ends up playing a pivotal role in offering them guidance and helping them through their problems.
Back when he played in high school, Ukai never got to play as the team&rsquo;s official setter except for once in his third year. He was frustrated that, as a setter, he was overlooked by someone younger than him. As such, he struggles at certain points throughout the popular Shonen Jump manga to make decisions about the team lineup because he knows the emotional difficulties that the players who aren&rsquo;t chosen have to contend with. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Ukai continues to keep his love of volleyball alive in his life in other ways beyond playing professionally, such as playing with a local team, so that passion understandably never left him.
