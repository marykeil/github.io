# My Hero Academia Finally Fixes Bakugo s Resurrection


## SUMMARY 



  Bakugo&#39;s revival in My Hero Academia chapter 405 was caused by Edgeshot using his own body mass to heal Bakugo&#39;s injuries, but it was Bakugo&#39;s own power that ultimately brought him back to life.   The lack of a strong relationship between Bakugo and Edgeshot initially made Bakugo&#39;s revival less satisfying, but this chapter reveals that Edgeshot sees Bakugo&#39;s own determination and growth as the true reason for his revival.   Despite the controversy, some Bakugo fans may find comfort in the fact that his return was a result of his own strength and hard work, making the limited relationship with Edgeshot more bearable.

## Literature Review

Bakugo&#39;s situation in My Hero Academia has left some fans displeased, but the latest chapter may have fixed at least one problem with his return.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia, Ch. #405My Hero Academia&#39;s Bakugo recently made his dramatic return to the field of battle after being believed to be dead, but the circumstances of his revival had caused a stir among some fans. However, chapter 405 reveals the details of Bakugo&#39;s revival, which may help to alleviate at least some of the concerns fans had about his brush with death.




Chapter 405 surprisingly reveals that Edgeshot, a hero who decided to risk his own life to save Bakugo&#39;s, was in fact still alive, having used up much of the mass of his body to stitch up Bakugo&#39;s injuries, both internal and external. The small bit of Edgeshot that remains explains that while he was able to sew up and even restart Bakugo&#39;s heart and lungs, something was still missing, and the young hero wasn&#39;t getting up like he should.

          

That&#39;s when Edgeshot noticed one of the beads of nitroglycerin, the very substance which caused Bakugo&#39;s fatal injuries, and that bead provided the final spark to reignite Bakugo&#39;s life force.


 Bakugo Was Revived By His Own Power, Not Edgeshot&#39;s 
          




One problem many fans had with Bakugo&#39;s revival was that Bakugo and Edgeshot really didn&#39;t have much of a relationship. Edgeshot helped save Bakugo when he was kidnapped, but that&#39;s about the extent of their interaction. It would&#39;ve been more meaningful to have Edgeshot be the one risking himself for Bakugo&#39;s sake had the two developed some kind of relationship, the way Bakugo had with Best Jeanist. Instead, it comes across as more of a generically heroic thing to do, saving a child&#39;s life at risk to one&#39;s own, and while Bakugo shows Edgeshot respect afterward, it&#39;s undeniably less satisfying.

In this chapter, however, Edgeshot insists that Bakugo and the efforts he went to in order to grow stronger are what&#39;s really responsible for his revival. Had it not been for the bead of nitroglycerin, Edgeshot&#39;s work to save Bakugo would have all been for naught. It&#39;s a tad ironic, as these beads caused the damage that had Bakugo so close to death in the first place. In a way, Bakugo&#39;s revival here is similar to Shigaraki&#39;s revival in the Paranormal Liberation War arc, as both are attributed to their own power, rather than the outside forces which were seemingly responsible for their return to life.




While it&#39;s likely to still be controversial, some Bakugo fans may be pleased to learn that it was Bakugo&#39;s own power, which he worked so hard to hone, that was responsible for bringing him back from the brink. It makes the fact that Edgeshot and Bakugo didn&#39;t have much of a relationship a little more bearable, especially knowing that Edgeshot did not die for Bakugo&#39;s sake. From Edgeshot&#39;s point of view, what he did was little more than what a medic might&#39;ve done, even though the reality is that it was far more than that. Either way, Bakugo is back in My Hero Academia, and not a moment too soon.
