# Every One Piece Mystery Is Connected By One Simple Explanation

## Literature Review

This simple connection may explain every One Piece mystery including Devil Fruits, the Lunarians, and the secrets of the Void Century.

The idea of a single unified theory that explains every mystery in One Piece sounds unimaginable and near idealistic, but it&#39;s something that many experts and content creators tried their hands at. Although the manga has finally entered the Final Saga, the ending of One Piece still seems nowhere in sight given the many loose ends left to tie up. Rather, the intrigue surrounding several existing mysteries has only grown. However, the answer to many of the series&#39; biggest mysteries may be connected by a rather simple explanation disguised in plain view.



Although fans have long known that the world of One Piece is incomparable to our own, it does share a striking resemblance to another real-world planet within the solar system—Uranus, which is, coincidence or not, the name of one of the three Ancient Weapons as well. Unlikely as it may sound, a closer examination of the similarities and differences between the two planets, keeping in mind everything Eichiiro Oda has revealed about the curious world of One Piece so far, could be the key to connecting many of the series&#39; most elusive mysteries.





 The World of One Piece Was Once Tilted on Its Side Like Uranus 
          

The world of One Piece appears to be heavily inspired by Uranus which has a similar blue appearance and a red ring (created by its planetary rings) that looks suspiciously similar to the Red Line. Moreover, Uranus is the only planet in the Solar System that rotates on its side and has its poles and axis are parallel to its orbital plane, spending every fourth of its 84-year-long orbit with one pole facing the sun while the other hemisphere is cast into a 21-year-long winter. If One Piece&#39;s planet was also tilted similarly in the past, then Toki&#39;s unnerving prophecy about the dawn to come in twenty years as well as her choice to send the Akazaya samurai exactly twenty years into the future suddenly takes on new meaning, especially given that Toki is from the Void Century.




                  One Piece Spoiled The Location Of The Final Treasure In The First Chapter – Theory   Elusive as the One Piece may be, this popular theory suggests the secret to its location may lie in Roger&#39;s very first lines in the series.   

The assumption that One Piece&#39;s planet was once also tilted similarly to Uranus stems primarily from a popular theory by Youtuber Drop the Pizza which claims the world of One Piece underwent a pole shift, likely during the Void Century, which tilted the planet&#39;s axis by 90 degrees. This would mean that the planet likely rested on its side with its axis passing through Reverse Mountain and Fishman Island, which were the former North and South Poles respectively. That said, as well as it sets the groundwork, this theory overlooks the planet&#39;s resemblance to Uranus which suggests a similar tilt would have had severe, unimaginable consequences, in turn explaining several mysteries.



 The Lunarians Became Invulnerable To Survive Extreme Climate 
          




A shift so drastic coupled with a unique orbit like Uranus would have left the world of One Piece with extreme climate and only a small strip of habitable land. These conditions would be especially severe on the Red Line and around each of the poles. If so, early inhabitants such as the Lunarians would have had to adapt to extreme temperatures and living in darkness for months or years at a stretch when one of the poles was away from the sun.

Thus, they may have developed their infamous invulnerability in order to survive these extreme climatic conditions in the past. Moreover, the fire on their backs might have had a more practical use, especially during the long dark winters. On the other hand, those without the Lunarians&#39; strength and resilience might have developed other ways to survive the harsh planet which could explain the existence of the Devil Fruits as well as another curious invention from the past.



 The Devil Fruits And The Eternal Flame Were Intended For Survival 
          




The Egghead Island Arc revealed a key piece of information about the Great Kingdom that single-handedly recontextualized perceptions of the Void Century as well. The Iron Giant on Egghead revealed that the Great Kingdom was a highly technologically advanced nation with an energy source far beyond imagination called the Eternal Flame. Lilith even mentions that she could use this Eternal Flame to create a second sun in Chapter #1065. Like the Lunarians, the Great Kingdom might have created the Eternal Flame as well as the mysterious Devil Fruits to aid survival amidst the extreme conditions caused by the planet&#39;s unique orbit.

A struggle for limited resources would also easily explain the war that erupted between the Great Kingdom and the ancestors of the Celestial Dragons, who then founded the World Government. Moreover, the great struggle in the Void Century that ended the Great Kingdom may have been caused by the desire to monopolize this valuable power source, seeing as the Lunarians were hunted down as well, and still are in the present.






 The Shift In Water Levels Explains Many Submerged Islands 
          

The unique axial tilt of the planet would have caused a shift in water levels every time the seasons changed as any glaciers in the hemisphere facing the sun would melt from receiving constant sunlight. This extreme seasonal flooding coupled with constant hurricanes may explain why many of One Piece&#39;s islands are sinking or show signs of being submerged in the past. For instance, the high walls surrounding Wano and the submerged old country underneath that conceals Pluton may have been built to counter similar flooding. This theory might also explain how the underwater prison of Impel Down was built and why the 5000-year-old tree on Ohara showed signs of being worn down by higher water levels at some point in time.

The idea of the axis shift is surely one of the most interesting One Piece theory out there, but until now no one has noticed the similarities between the planet where the series takes place and Uranus. This astronomical connection would also not be too unexpected, as Oda has already taken inspiration from the planets in the Solar System for the names of the Five Elders, which is yet another clue about the presence of &#34;aliens&#34; in the series. That said, Oda and his masterpiece have a long-running reputation of defying fan expectations, so only time will tell whether the geography of One Piece truly holds the key to connecting all of its mysteries.
