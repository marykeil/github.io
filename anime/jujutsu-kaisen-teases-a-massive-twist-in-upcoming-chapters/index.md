## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s editor teases plenty of shocking twists in the upcoming chapters, leading to frenzied speculation among fans. 




The battle against Sukuna has been full of unforeseen twists and turns, and Jujutsu Kaisen has just teased its upcoming chapter may have yet another massive twist in store. Chapter #247 of Jujutsu Kaisen left readers at the edge of their seats, and recent comments by the series&#39; editor hint the series is only going to get more chaotic from here on out.




According to a recent comment by Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s editor, Junya Fukuda, fans can expect plenty of shocking twists in the upcoming chapters of Jujutsu Kaisen. While he does not reveal any hints as to what these shocking developments could entail, the news has brewed up quite a storm among fans, with speculations running wild as to what direction the battle against Sukuna will take next.


 

To add to the intrigue, the interview teases the development to be so shocking that the host was unable to take his eyes off a particular panel in the upcoming chapter, as this X user @JJK_Mya points out. While the panel in question is censored in the broadcast, this hasn&#39;t deterred fans from attempting to decipher it and speculate on the upcoming twist.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Shocks Fans With Another Unexpected Death   Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s latest battle has taken an unexpected turn with yet another shocking death in the final pages of its latest chapter.   





 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Upcoming Twist Could Bring Back a Fan-Favourite Character 
          

The controversy caused by the comment has reawakened hopes for the return of several fan-favorite characters, the foremost being Gojo, whose shocking death still has many fans in denial. That said, as shocking as such a development would be, given creator Gege Akutami&#39;s strong dislike for Gojo, and the current state of events in Jujutsu Kaisen, his return seems unlikely. The series has set the stage for Yuji&#39;s big showdown against Sukuna, teasing Yuji&#39;s mysterious new power-up on many occasions, and Gojo&#39;s return would likely take away Yuji&#39;s spotlight once again.

          




Conversely, some fans have speculated the upcoming chapter could see the return of Nobara instead. Considering the ambiguous circumstances of her death during the Shibuya Arc, Nobara&#39;s return isn&#39;t entirely impossible and would certainly be shocking enough to warrant the comment by the series editor. Fans have also speculated that Nobara&#39;s Cursed Technique could possibly be helpful in saving Megumi, should the current plan involving the Executioner&#39;s Sword fail.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Is About To Reveal Megumi&#39;s Fate   Jujutsu Kaisen has just teased more than one potential fate for Sukuna&#39;s newest vessel, Megumi Fushiguro, and there may still be hope for him.   

          

That said, there&#39;s also the possibility that the upcoming twist does not bode well for Yuji and the sorcerers, taking a negative turn with yet another shocking death instead​​​​​​. Jujutsu Kaisen has never been afraid to kill off its main cast and its next victim could be Higuruma, Megumi, Yuta, or even Yuji.
