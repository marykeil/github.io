## Literature Review

Mystery can take many different forms in anime, from classic murder cases to unexplored fantastical worlds, but it is always engaging and captivating.





The idea of mystery can present itself in a variety of ways, from the common murder cases wherein a detective or unwilling third party is forced to find the culprit, to the overall mysterious and intriguing atmosphere of worlds where the truth seems to always be just out of reach. Covering every type of mystery the medium has to offer, these are the iconic stories that can best be described as strange and puzzling.









 








 10  Psycho-Pass 
        

Psycho-Pass is set in a world defined by the Sibyl System, which is supposed to flawlessly and objectively assess Japanese citizens, not only assigning them the right career paths, but also dealing with crime before it even happens, by determining the latent criminal potential of people. The ones following this system and upholding justice are pairs of Inspectors and Enforcers, tasked with finding and subjugating criminals. There are various intriguing mysteries to solve in this show, ranging from short yet compelling murder cases, to the question that everyone seems to ask, yet few have the courage to investigate, the true nature of the Sibyl System.

 9  Baccano! 
        

The experience of watching Baccano! is akin to that of solving a puzzle, as seemingly different pieces are presented to the viewers who have to somehow put them together and figure out how the events are linked. Despite being set in completely unrelated times and places, different stories are told simultaneously, with some revolving around mafia crime drama, while others follow groups of people seeking to obtain immortality. The unique pacing and storytelling method allow this title not only to stand out from its peers, but also to be recognized as one of the most intriguing and compelling mysteries of the medium.





 8  Made in Abyss 
        

Mystery titles typically involve a trigger that prompts one to uncover the truth behind a situation, such as the occurrence of a crime or a pressing question being raised. Made in Abyss departs from that formula significantly, as its source of wonder is not an event, but rather a place. The titular Abyss is a vast, largely unexplored chasm, said to be roamed by ancient creatures and filled with long-lost technology. However, it is also extremely dangerous, which is why few have accepted the task of investigating it, and no one who reached its depths has returned alive to tell the story, but Reg and Riko have their reasons.





 7  From the New World 
        

The events of From the New World take place in a world where the sudden awakening of psychic powers in 0.1% of the population leads to a long period of power abuse, violence, and oppressive regimes. In an attempt to achieve peace, those with power decide to isolate themselves from the rest of the humans. The story mostly unfolds around the town of Kamisu 66, which may appear to be a utopia where psychic humans live freely, but eventually reveals itself to be more of a dystopia. This complex world is truly enigmatic, as much of society&#39;s past is shrouded in mystery, and many truths are buried deep beneath the surface.

Anime often leaves questions unanswered, but some plot points are more mysterious than others, and they are still waiting to be solved.








 6  Gosick 
        

Gosick revolves around two students of the Saint Marguerite Academy, a luxurious boarding school in Southern Europe. One of them is Kazuya Kujou, a student from Japan known as &#34;The Black Reaper&#34; due to the color of his hair and eyes, and the other is Victorique de Blois, &#34;The Golden Fairy&#34; whose family background and childhood caused her to develop intelligence of unparalleled levels, to the point where she can virtually predict the future. After meeting each other by chance, the two end up drawn into various cases of inexplicable events, but they always get to the bottom of the truth, as Victorique enjoys the challenges and dislikes being bored.





 5  Great Pretender 
        

As one of the best original anime titles, Great Pretender is a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable show, wherein the mystery is not typically solved by the characters, but rather by the viewers. The story revolves around Makoto Edamura, Japan&#39;s self-proclaimed greatest swindler, as he is drawn in by Laurent Thierry and his varied associates into the world of high-stakes fraud. Not too dissimilar from typical mystery shows, which are often presented in the form of cases, Great Pretender is also separated into different fraud cases, whose details and methods may be confusing to viewers at times, but all the pieces always fall into place eventually, leading to a satisfying reveal.





 4  Odd Taxi 
        

As a title that can hardly be compared to anything else in the medium, Odd Taxi took the anime world by storm when it was released, surprising viewers with its original themes and unique atmosphere. The show follows the titular taxi driver Hiroshi Odokawa, a &#34;walrus&#34; who, unlike the interesting clients he drives around, lives a mostly uneventful life. That is, at least, until he gets caught up in the case of a missing girl. As details about different characters are slowly revealed, and various developments take place, the truth behind everything may seem to be within reach, but nothing can prepare viewers for the final reveal.





 3  Summer Time Rendering 
        

The events of Summer Time Rendering take place on a small island, which Shinpei Ajiro had left in order to pursue further education in Tokyo. After returning to his hometown to attend the funeral of Ushio Kofune, his childhood friend who supposedly drowned while trying to save someone else, he ends up observing inconsistencies in the world that surrounds him and getting caught up in a plot much more complicated than he could have ever expected. Even with Shinpei&#39;s power to travel back in time and the help of his allies, the tasks of learning the truth about the island and keeping his friends safe are certainly not easy.

 2  Terror in Resonance 
        

A terrorist attack on a Japanese nuclear facility stuns the government, as they find themselves unable to find the perpetrators and prepare for ensuing events. The public remains ignorant of this, until, six months later, two teenage boys who call themselves &#34;Sphinx&#34; upload a video online, openly challenging the police with riddles and threatening to cause destruction and disrupt the peace of Tokyo, without so much as making any demands or revealing their reasons. Terror in Resonance revolves around the enigmatic identity and purpose of Nine and Eleven, the boys behind Sphinx, as they make their stand in a world wherein they shouldn&#39;t exist.





 1  ERASED 
        

ERASED follows Satoru Fujinuma, a man with the ability to travel back in time right before accidents occur, which he has often used to prevent tragedies and save people. However, everything he thought he knew about his power is challenged when, instead of the several-minute time frame he was used to, he is sent 18 years into the past, tasked with learning the truth behind the abduction and murder of one of his classmates. Despite being set in a school, this show is rather mature, competently portraying themes such as abuse and loneliness. Moreover, it is not only a great mystery title, but also one of the best time travel anime.
Some of the entries on this list are more grounded in nature and follow realistic yet compelling stories, while others are on the supernatural side, occasionally even incorporating time loops, seeking to present a mystery that could not exist in any other medium. Either way, what they all have in common is that they know exactly when and how to reveal new information and allow for new developments, resulting in brilliant pacing and captivating experiences. This is what sets the best anime mystery shows apart from the rest and allows them to shine.
