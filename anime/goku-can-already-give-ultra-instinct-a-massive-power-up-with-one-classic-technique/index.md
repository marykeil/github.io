# Goku Can Already Give Ultra Instinct a Massive Power-Up With One Classic Technique


## SUMMARY 



  Goku&#39;s Ultra Instinct form can be made even stronger by using the Kaio-ken technique.   Goku has previously used the Kaio-ken to boost his god-like powers during the Dragon Ball Super anime.   Combining Ultra Instinct with the Kaio-ken would likely make Goku the strongest fighter in the Dragon Ball franchise.

## Literature Review

Goku&#39;s newest Ultra Instinct form is incredibly powerful, but one trick used in Dragon Ball Super could make it multiple times stronger.

Goku has unlocked powers beyond what the Dragon Ball Super anime has presented, but one of his best tricks can make Ultra Instinct multiple times stronger. After training with a literal angel from the Dragon Ball universe, Goku attained the Ultra Instinct form, also known as the &#34;state of the gods.&#34; However, a clever tactic used during one of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s best scenes heavily implies it can be used again with Goku&#39;s latest power-up if he gets strong enough to use it without dying.

The power-ups attained by both Goku and Vegeta during Dragon Ball Super were unlocked after the Saiyans learned how to use god-ki, a pure form of ki used by divine beings such as Gods of Destruction and Angels. Goku shocked Beerus and delighted anime viewers the first time he magnified the power and speed of his godly Super Saiyan Blue tenfold using the Kaio-ken, a move that should also work with Ultra Instinct.


 




During the epic climax of Death Battle!&#39;s third Goku versus Superman animation, the Perfected Ultra Instinct form is given a Kaio-ken boost in Goku&#39;s last-ditch effort to defeat Superman. While the launching of the attack was powerful enough to shatter the Earth he was standing on, it failed to stop the Man of Steel. Goku has yet to boost his newest form with the Kaio-ken in the Dragon Ball Super storyline. While it might be incredibly risky, the divine combo might be his next dramatic power-up.


 Goku Should Be Able To Multiply Ultra Instinct&#39;s Strength With Kaio-Ken 
         

During Goku&#39;s toughest battles during Dragon Ball Super, he proved that the Kaio-ken can magnify his godly powers. Goku multiplied his Super Saiyan Blue powers by 20x against Jiren during the epic Tournament of Power arc. Still, the impressive power-up multiplier paled in comparison to Ultra Instinct&#39;s might. The Earth Saiyan is now even stronger since he first unlocked Ultra Instinct by learning to control the form and using it in larger-than-life ways. The Death Battle&#39;s epic final move saw Goku do a Kaio-ken boosted Perfected Ultra Instinct Kamehameha, a move that future DBS arcs should use.




Goku&#39;s mysterious new Dragon Ball Super power grants him a giant spiritual avatar similar to the Susanoo used by the Uchiha clan in the Naruto series. The Perfected Ultra Instinct is one of the Saiyan&#39;s strongest forms. Still, it is challenging to use because its users need complete control of their emotions, something a warrior race can not do easily. Like the Kaio-ken, the UI form can also cause great harm and stress to its user if it&#39;s overused. Suppose Goku is able to master his Ultra Instinct form further and reduce its dangerous drawbacks. In that case, Goku maybe able to use the also risky Kaio-ken to magnify his UI form.



 Misusing Ultra Instinct Or Kaio-Ken Is Dangerous, Mixing Them Could Be Deadly 
          

The Kaio-ken has successfully gotten Goku out of many tough situations since he learned it from King Kai in Dragon Ball Z&#39;s first arcs. From breaking Vegeta mentally to standing toe-to-toe with Galactic Emperor Frieza and ultimately magnifying his new godly powers against Hit&#39;s broken time-skip ability, the Kaio-ken is a move that&#39;s proved to be more than useful. Still, it has yet to be used with the Ultra Instinct form. Although both forms have a massive risk of harming the user after overuse, mastering the combination of Ultra Instinct with Kaio-ken would easily make Goku the strongest fighter in the Dragon Ball franchise.
