## Literature Review

Crunchyroll has released two Blu-ray editions of season 2 of Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World and one comes with several bonus items!




Crunchyroll has released the second season of Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World on Blu-ray. The isekai series follows Subaru Natsuki, a young man who suddenly finds himself in the Kingdom of Lugunica with a strange new ability: Return by Death. The Blu-ray of the series is offered in two editions, standard and limited edition.




Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World began airing in 2016. It is based on the web novel series of the same name by Tappei Nagatsuki, which was adapted into a light novel by Nagatsuki and Shin&#39;ichirō Otsuka. It has also been adapted into three manga series and a manga anthology. This dark isekai fantasy has become popular, particularly fan-favorite characters Rem and Ram. It now has two seasons, with a third officially on the way.

The second season of Re: Zero began airing in 2020 and has now received a physical release. Crunchyroll offers a standard edition, featuring just the Blu-ray itself, while its limited edition features a few additional items. These include an art book, stickers, and art cards, valued an extra twenty dollars higher than the base edition. Like many of Crunchyroll&#39;s anime offerings, the physical copy of Re: Zero can be watched as a sub or dub. The limited edition also features a case that fits Season 2, the artbook, and leaves room for fans who own Season 1 to place the case inside and complete the set.

Season 2 has four disks in its set, bringing together Episodes 26 - 50 of the series. The fourth disk has a few special features, including promos, commercials, and textless versions of the series&#39; songs. The limited edition items include four stickers, which feature Rem, Ram, Frederica, and Petra in maid outfits. It also includes eight art cards, which feature several of the main characters, like Roswaal and Beatrice. The art book is eighty-seven pages long and includes close-ups of the characters, creatures and settings from the second season, and some assorted items. It concludes with some scene sketches.

Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World season 2 features Subaru still trying to help Emilia while he meets many new characters involved in the Witches&#39; Cult, as well as in a place called Sanctuary. The standard edition of this season typically costs $69.98, while the limited edition costs $89.98. However, Crunchyroll often runs sales in which the limited edition will retail for around the same price as the standard. Discounts in the store are also available to members of certain subscription levels for the streaming service. Crunchyroll&#39;s limited edition version of the second season is not a must for all anime fans, but those who love Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World will definitely want to pick it up.




Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World is available on streaming from Crunchyroll.
