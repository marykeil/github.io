## Literature Review

With winter in full swing, now is the perfect time to watch Crunchyroll&#39;s Laid-Back Camp, a slice-of-life staple that shows the warmth of the cold.




While the cold season may seem like something to merely tolerate, it is also the perfect time to revisit Laid-Back Camp, which is currently hosted on Crunchyroll. While it may be easy to chalk up its popularity to being one of the first shows to revitalize the &#34;cute girls doing hobbies&#34; formula, C-Station&#39;s anime draws on a variety of strong points. All of these, together with its cheery cast, are what help make the idea of winter camping &#34;comfortable&#34;.




Laid-Back Camp is considered one of the best examples of the iyashikei genre, which is usually translated to &#34;healing&#34;. While this gives the impression that such shows mostly involve saccharine escapism, the anime adaptation might not be what viewers expect.

          

Rather than relying on sentimentality, Laid-Back Camp uses a variety of elements to build up an atmosphere that&#39;s frequently meditative and quiet, which better captures the essence of camping.

While the main cast of Laid-Back Camp chiefly involves students involved in a camping club, C-Station&#39;s real strength in adapting the story is providing an expansive look at winter camping that goes beyond just watching &#34;wacky hijinks&#34; that the iyashikei genre is sometimes overly reliant on. Though comedy is often employed to soften events, Laid-Back Camp&#39;s best moments follow the deuteragonist Shima Rin as she engages in solo trips. Here, things are quiet, allowing the experienced camper to wander and take in the atmosphere around Japan, whose temples and restaurants are drawn in lush detail.

Between the food sections and the camping trivia, Laid-Back Camp can sometimes feel like a travelog, especially during the second season&#39;s finale. Still, the goal of Laid-Back Camp&#39;s &#34;healing&#34; is to provide the kind of comfort that is only found in winter. With the limited crowds, Rin and the others provide audiences with a sense of solitude: long stretches spent sitting in restaurants or at campsites, while the folksy soundtrack consisting of guitars, flutes, and violins, complements it all with a sense of nomadic adventure. Winter here is presented as an opportunity to find room for oneself again.

With two seasons, each with 13 episodes, there is enough Laid-Back Camp to make it through December. There is even a movie that depicts the cast as adults; if nothing else, it only proves the allure of iyashikei exists outside of youths getting up to antics. While many shows have followed in the wake of its success, the travels of the Camping Club continue to stand out because C-Station understood that winter is not &#34;cute&#34;. Crunchyroll&#39;s Laid-Back Camp knows its strength is in its restfulness - for those who fear winter, this might be the show to see what it can offer.
