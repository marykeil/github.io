## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #6 will feature a conflict between Cid in the guise of John Smith and his Shadow Garden devotees.




Episode #6 of The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 will continue the story started in episode #5 by Cid&#39;s plan to flood the market with counterfeit bills. These conflicts have the potential to make the current arc of The Eminence in Shadow one of the most important in the series. As Episode #5 showed, Cid&#39;s new persona also has the potential to make it the funniest.

 What Happened in The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #5? 
          




Episode #5 began with escalating tension between Mitsugoshi and the Major Corporate Alliance as Gettan sent his Clovers to attack the store. Luckily Gamma fought them off in hilarious fashion. The episode then transitioned into showing Cid (in his John Smith persona) and Yukime beginning their plan to introduce a large amount of counterfeit bills into the market. This greatly worried both Shadow Garden and Gettan, who was revealed to be a high-ranking member of the Cult of Diabolos. In response to this, Shadow Garden sent three agents to disrupt a shipment of the counterfeit bills, but John Smith was able to easily defeat them using magically reinforced string. That fight again showed how chaotic The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s hero can be, as Cid is essentially fighting against the group he created.



 In The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #6 Shadow Garden Will Fight Cid 
          




John Smith&#39;s victory over the group of Shadow Garden agents sent to stop him will likely cause the organization to take him as a serious threat. Thus, they will likely try to face him again this time potentially with one of the Seven Shades in attendance. This represents a major escalation in power level and may even give Cid a hard time in battle. It will also be interesting to see how the Shades react to learning Cid is the one responsible for this scheme to damage the trust in Mitsugoshi&#39;s credit if they can see through his disguise. While they are all incredibly loyal to him, this may be seen as an act of betrayal that causes them to turn against him.

Gettan will likely also begin to move against Cid&#39;s counterfeit operation in episode #6, providing yet another interesting source of conflict. All this makes this arc incredibly chaotic but also shows why The Eminence in Shadow is one of the best isekai series. If Season 2 episode #6 will live up to its full potential, then The Eminence Shadow may even surpass its previous high standard.
