## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

An essential moment of failure helped to redefine Todoroki&#39;s character arc, leading into a new era for the Half-Hot/Half-Cold hero student.




An unexpected moment of failure in My Hero Academia actually played a key role for Shoto Todoroki, prompting him to reconcile with his father and setting up the rest of his growth, setting up a character arc that overshadows even that of the protagonist, Deku. This moment was the Provisional Licensing Exam, where Todoroki got caught up competing with a student from a rival school and ended up having to do remedial courses to obtain his license.




Todoroki&#39;s character arc begins with him being very cold towards everyone, but eventually warming up to his classmates after the Sports Festival, at which time Todoroki decides to make his power his own, and begins using his flames too, besides his ice powers. This was significant growth for him at the time, but it left his character in an awkward position, where his growth now needed to be oriented around his relationship with his father, the pro hero Endeavor. The Provisional Licensing Exam arc was the next big moment for young Todoroki, when he came across Shiketsu High School&#39;s Inasa Yoarashi, who had a bone to pick with Todoroki and his father.

During the Licensing Exam, the two were unable to work together, and while they built up respect for one another by the end, they still weren&#39;t really on good terms, and both ultimately failed the exam. Inasa was upset with Todoroki over their first meeting ages ago, when he was still an ice-cold, single-minded person. Had he not behaved that way back then, he and Inasa never would&#39;ve had problems with each other, and likely would&#39;ve succeeded at passing the exam. This moment helped Todoroki to realize that his feelings towards his father were causing him problems with people besides Endeavor, and that he needed to actually deal with that.




Endeavor would later show up to watch Todoroki at the remedial course, an attempt from his side to extend an olive branch to his son. During the remedial course, Todoroki learned how difficult dealing with children can be, and was willing to give his father another chance. This paved the way for Todoroki going to Endeavor&#39;s agency for the work-study period alongside Bakugo and Deku, as well as his enhanced relationship with Endeavor after the Paranormal Liberation War. While Todoroki hasn&#39;t fully forgiven his father for all his misbehavior, the two were able to build a more adult relationship as a result of Todoroki&#39;s experiences, like failing the Licensing Exam.



 Todoroki&#39;s Character Arc Is One Of The Best In My Hero Academia 
          

Failing the Licensing Exam was a turning point for Todoroki, causing him to finally reconsider his relationship with his father. Todoroki did not forgive Endeavor quickly, especially after all the suffering his behavior had caused his family, but Shoto needed to come to terms with it for himself, not for Endeavor. Todoroki&#39;s failure at the Licensing Exam opened a path of communication with his father again, and ultimately reshaped his character arc for the better. Todoroki is one of My Hero Academia&#39;s most popular characters for a reason, and it&#39;s because of his excellent character.

Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
