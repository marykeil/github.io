 10  Kiyoshi Teppei - The Iron Heart 
Center
        

 The Iron Heart, Kyioshi Teppi, has the strongest will for basketball and he showcased this on countless occasions as he forced himself to endure physical adversity to ensure the victory of Serin High School. Teppi is a 193 cm (6&#39; 4&#34;) center, who has the mindset and IQ of a point guard. With his right of postponement, and unusually large hands, he can change his course of play at the last second, his vice claw allows him to palm a ball from any position making him the ultimate rebounder, and he can run the point guard position able to make plays, pass, and shoot accurate 3&#39;s. Even while injured, Kiyoshi proves he is a formidable force to be reckoned with.





 9  Hizaki Shogo 
Small Forward Arrogant, selfish, and ruthlessly powerful, Hizaki Shogo is a nasty 188 cm (6&#39; 2&#34;) Small Forward who can render an entire team useless. Hisaki possesses the ability to witness any skill once and immediately execute it flawlessly while slightly altering the rhythm of it. Shogo is devious and goes as far as pillaging the abilities he copies, making the original owner unable to use that move anymore. Hisaki is a prodigy, but he is limited to what abilities he can pillage if the player is better. However, even with his attitude, he is hailed as on par with the Generation of Miracles.





 8  Midorima Shintaro 
Shooting Guard
        

 Midorima Shintaro is the 195 cm (6&#39; 5&#34;) Shooting Guard of the Generation of Miracles. Shintaro is a perfectionist who does everything humanly possible to make the best plays and leaves his fate to horoscopes. Midrorima is a prodigy and likely Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&#39;s most skilled player. He plays perfectly and leaves no room for error, making his unknown full potential terrifying.
Midorima is a defensive specialist, able to stop Kagami Taiga and his super jumps with little effort, his aptitude for shooting is unmatched, and he is capable of shooting from anywhere on the court with his limitless range. If nothing comes in contact with his shots, he can shoot with 100% accuracy, and his strength only increased when he began to rely on his teammates.





 7  Murasakibara Atsushi 
Center
        

 The most naturally gifted Center of the Generation of Miracles, Murasakibara Atsushi can stop an entire team from ever scoring. Atsushi is objectively large, standing at 208 cm (6&#39; 9.9&#34;) with an imposing wing span and long strides, he can guard everything within the 3-point line. He is limited to utilizing his full strength since he towers over all of his opponents, but once he went toe to toe with Jason Silver, he began to overpower him on both defense and offense until he was injured. His full potential is still unknown.
Murasakibara hates to practice, but he hates losing even more as shown when Yosen was losing to Serin, and he entered the zone, increasing his focus and skill. His most powerful move is Thor&#39;s Hammer, and the full extent of his strength is unknown because fans have only witnessed him acting on instinct and impulse alone.





 6  Kagami Taiga - The Ace 
Power Forward
        

 The Trojan Horse of the series, 190 cm (6&#39; 3&#34;) Power Forward Kagami Taiga proved himself to be on par with the Generation of Miracles by beating each of them. Kagami forced himself into the realm of prodigies and each of them could sense his presence. Taiga is Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&#39;s ultimate teammate​ and has entered the zone through his determination to fight for his team, the Direct Drive Zone, causing him to be in perfect synch with his team.
            
 
 10 Best Sports Anime of All Time 
Sports anime are some of the most compelling in the medium, but only a few are great enough to be called the best (and have major impacts on sports).



Kagami is the highest jumping athlete in Kuroko&#39;s Basketball and with his tiger-like animal instincts, he has dominated his opponents in aerial battles, especially with his falling star dunk, Meteor Jam. He has trained to become ambidextrous and a well-rounded shooter. He&#39;s increased his field of defense as much as Murasakibara, and in the zone he has even stopped Jason Silver. Aomine Daiki admitted Kagami was his best opponent, and that he has all the qualifications to be a &#34;Miracle.&#34;





 5  Jason Silver - Almighty Me 
Center
        

 The most physically dominant player in Kuroko&#39;s Basketball, Jason Silver is a freak of nature who does not train his body or his skills, and he is on a level that surpasses the Generation of Miracles and Kagami. Jason Silver is a 210 cm (6&#39; 11&#34;) Center for Team Jabberwock, with the animal instincts of a primal beast. It took the combined effort of Kise utilizing Perfect Copy and Aomine in the zone to double-team and stop Silver. Silver was able to outrun Aomine, and power through Murasakibara&#39;s defense to dunk.
Silver Caught up to Akashi shooting midrange from under the rim to block him outside the paint. Outran both Kise and Midorima on a fast break into a double-handed Windmill dunk from the free throw line. Stopped Kagami and Kuroko&#39;s Ignite Pass Kai dunk. Jason Silver with no training was able to outclass all of Team Vorpal Swords, the power that he could possess with practice and determination is horrifying.





 4  Kise Ryouta 
Small Forward
        

 Kise Ryuota is an 189 cm (6&#39;2&#34;) Small Forward who can copy anything physically the first time he&#39;s seen it with more power than the original. Within his first year of playing basketball, he was given the title of Generation of Miracles. Ryouta with his perfect copy can imitate all the GOMs and their abilities. During the last game, Kise entered the zone along with perfect copy and became the greatest player in the series.
He stopped Jason Silver on both offense and defense and controlled all Team Jabberwock with no help. Kise&#39;s Achilles Heel is his underdeveloped body and stamina, he can only utilize his full strength for 5 minutes. With more strength and endurance training, Kise would comfortably be Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&#39;s best player with no equals.





 3  Aomine Daiki - The Monster 
Power Forward
        

 The super scorer and ace of the Generation of Miracles, 192 cm (6&#39; 3½&#34;) Power Forward Aomine Daiki is the fastest athlete in the series and can score from any position on the court with his formless shot, while at high speeds and even behind the rim. Daiki is free-spirited and has an unorthodox street ball style with panther-like animal instincts. His versatility along with his agility and power makes his play range limitless as Aomine becomes stronger and more skilled the stronger his opponent is.
He can force himself into the zone by his sheer desire to be the best and control Team Jabberwock with his play. Aomine does not practice and becomes bored with basketball saying &#34;The only one that can beat me is me.&#34; Daiki dominated Serin until Kagami entered the zone finally giving him a worthy opponent. Although Aomine lost due to lack of stamina and practice, he is the epitome of talent and potential, and his passion for basketball and being the best could make him the greatest of all time.





 2  Nash Gold Jr. - The Magician 
Point Guard
        

 Nash Gold Jr., the 190 cm (6&#39; 3&#34;) Point Guard for Team Jabberwock, is an arrogant prodigy who believes his skills can surpass gods. Unlike the GOM and Silver, Gold Jr. has spent countless hours honing his skills and has gone beyond their talents. He possesses the belial eye a visual prowess that, unlike the emperor eye, can see the future of all players on the court. He has ineffable preparatory movements that make him unpredictable, motionless passes, and high-level dribbling that make his play impossible to defend.
Nash can switch between an unorthodox street ball style and an orthodox traditional style that makes all of his skills and visual prowess enhance astronomically where he wastes no movements playing perfectly. He can catch and block Aomine, ankle break Akashi, ankle breaks and blow past Midorima, and score on Kagami in the Zone.





 1  Akashi Senjuro - The Emperor 
Point Guard
        

 The Emperor, Akashi Senjuro, 173 cm (5&#39; 8&#34;) Point Guard, commands leadership over Rakuzan and the GOM. Senjuro had never lost before so coming close to it, because of Murasakibara, gave birth to Emperor Akashi. Akashi has polished skills, and athleticism, and plays without error. His emperor&#39;s eye allows him to have the ultimate defense and offense, ankle-breaking, and blocking shots before players plan to shoot. All of it adds up to making Akashi Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&#39;s best player.
Akashi&#39;s emperor eye stopped Kagami while in the zone, Midorima&#39;s high projectile 3s, and Nash’s motionless pass and dribbling. Akashi enters the zone by abandoning his teammates and with the emperor eye zone, he&#39;s faster than Aomine. Senjuro&#39;s original personality, while in the zone, can put teammates into the zone and stop Kagami&#39;s direct drive zone.
Kuroko&#39;s Basketball completed with The Last Game in 2017 and since then fans have debated which players were the best of the series. Players like Hanamiya Makoto, Point Guard for the Uncrowned Kings, and Himuro Tatsuya, Small Forward for Yosen High School are just a few of the names that come into the discussion. However, the series showcases each player&#39;s strengths and limitations, making it easy to see which players are the best in Kuroko&#39;s Basketball.
