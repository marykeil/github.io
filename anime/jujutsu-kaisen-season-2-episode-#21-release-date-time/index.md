## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #21 will feature more intense fighting between Yuji, Mahito, and Todo as the Shibuya Incident heads to its ending.




With episode #20 providing fans with a bit of hope after the depressing events preceding it, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #21 is poised to launch into the Shibuya Incidentâ€™s next epic fight. Based on the animation in episode #20, this fight may even be on the level of Sukuna&#39;s battles earlier in the arc. If it is, then it could end the Shibuya Incident arc on a great note.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #21 Releases 
          

If it isn&#39;t delayed, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #21 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, December 14. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on December 14 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #20? 
          




Still reeling from the Shibuya Incident&#39;s most shocking moment in episode #19, Yuji began episode #20 by being brutally beaten by Mahito, who managed to perform a black flash. Luckily, Todo and Arata, a fellow student from the Kyoto school, showed up and saved him. Arata told Yuji that Nobara might actually still be alive and Todo gave him a pep talk about all the sorcerers in Shibuya knowing what they were getting into. This reinvigorated Yuji, so he and Todo were able to renew the fight against Mahito with added intensity. While synchronizing with Yuji, Todo was also able to perform a black flash against Mahito. Thus each combatant in the fight was operating at 120% of their full potential when the episode ended.



Mechamaru also had an emotional goodbye with Miwa.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #21 Will Feature Shibuya&#39;s Climactic Fight 
          




All of Yuji&#39;s suffering in Shibuya has built up to this fight against Mahito. This makes their ultimate showdown even more cathartic to watch, as each blow Yuji unleashes upon the curse has both physical and emotional weight to it. Given it seems like Mei Mei&#39;s fight with Geto&#39;s body may have been resolved off-screen since Gojo&#39;s prison is missing, this may even be the final climactic fight of the arc. If it is, it would make sense for the animators to make it one of the best fights of the season and end the Shibuya Incident on a hype note.

While Studio MAPPA has had problems during Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s production, it looks like this has not stopped the animators from producing some incredible work, as episode #20 shows. As of now it is unclear if the remainder of the fight will be as well animated, but hopefully, it will be. If Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #21 manages to live up to the high standards set by the rest of the season, then it will give fans an exciting climax to one of Shonen anime&#39;s best arcs.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #21 when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 14, 2023.
