# New Netflix Anime Stands Out As The Best Manga Reboot In A Long Time


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix&#39;s Pluto is a reboot of the popular manga series by Naoki Urasawa, and has proven itself to be an adaptation that rivals the quality of the original work.   Based on a story arc from Osamu Tezuka&#39;s Astro Boy, Naoki Urasawa expanded upon the original story&#39;s perspective and adds a mystery element, making it more interesting and captivating.

## Literature Review

Netflix’s version of a classic Astro Boy story is more than just a common anime adaptation but a shining reboot of a forgotten fan-favorite tale.




One of the main source matrials for anime is manga, which is the case for Netflix&#39;s new series Pluto. However, the adaption of Pluto is a bit different from other anime, as it is a reboot of the popular manga series of the same title, that is a reboot of a chapter of the original Astro Boy manga. Comparatively speaking, Netflix&#39;s Pluto is the best version of the three.




Pluto was written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa. It&#39;s his reinterpretation of Osamu Tezuka&#39;s  story, &#34;The Greatest Robot on Earth,&#34; which can be found in Astro Boy volume 3, chapter 7, and was originally published in March 1964. That story follows Astro Boy as he sets out to defeat Pluto, a super robot that&#39;s systematically challenging and killing off the seven greatest robots in the world.

          

The story is a classic Astro Boy story of good versus evil that includes a healthy serving of Tezuka&#39;s influential perspective on the real world. There is a clear anti-war message weaved into it as well as Tezuka&#39;s long held hope that violence and hate could be overcome if the people of the world could communicate with each other more effectively.




                  Netflix&#39;s Dark Take on a Beloved Manga Franchise Could Be The Year&#39;s Best Anime   Netflix continues its expansion into the world of anime with the adaptation of a manga masterpiece that looks to be an instant classic.

While keeping true to the background and context of the original Astro Boy chapter, Urasawa revamps the story&#39;s perspective. He does this by expanding the primary third-person perspective of the original to include the first-person perspective of different characters, specifically that of the super robot and EuroPol detective Gesicht. In the original, Gesicht tried to arrest Pluto before he was subsequently smashed to bits. In Pluto, Gesicht&#39;s perspective is made all the more interesting by another Urasawa tweak – making the story a mystery and including the murder of humans as a tie-in to the death of the great robots. In the original, Pluto never hid who he was and what he was trying to do. In fact, he was completely open about his plan. However, he never harmed humans in his quest.




Netflix&#39;s version of Pluto takes Urasawa&#39;s great work and turns it into an animated masterpiece. While the changes are less drastic than those made by Urasawa to the Tezuka original, they nevertheless refine specific aspects of the story that elevate it to the next level. First, there&#39;s the art. While neither Astro Boy nor Pluto were particularly known for their art, Netflix anime is, and they spare no expense in producing a story of dazzling brilliance.

The soundtrack and energy behind the animation create tension in a heart-pounding way that would be impossible to properly visualize in the manga. Most importantly, however, is what the anime adaptation chooses to focus on in the story. It dives deeper into the &#34;joys and sorrows&#34; of having robots living alongside humans. It asks the questions, &#34;Should robots live among us, and how much does a robot need to assimilate to be acceptable in society?&#34; As a result, besides the sci-fi action and thrilling mystery, there are also captivating discussions that are relevant in real life.

In the prologue to the original Astro Boy chapter, Tezuka speaks about how he wrote the story when the Astro Boy television series was at the peak of its popularity. As such, it was one of the manga&#39;s highest rated chapters due to the battles between the robots. Urasawa&#39;s tweaks made a good story even better. Tezuka applauded Urasawa&#39;s effort and even helped him develop a deeper understanding of Astro Boy. Still, It&#39;s not hard to think that Tezuka would likely consider Netflix&#39;s Pluto the version closest to what he wanted to say in the story. Good fights and mesmerizing mystery aside, the true story of Pluto is about humans and their machines.
