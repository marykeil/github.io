## Literature Review

While many fans still point to series from decades ago as first-class mecha anime, some of the genre’s best have been produced in the last five years.




As one of the oldest and most prolific genres of animated entertainment, there&#39;s no shortage of great mecha anime for fans to enjoy. Indeed, there&#39;s so much great mecha anime content - dating back to the mid-20th century - that fans looking to deep dive into the genre might feel overwhelmed by the diversity of choices. However, one of the easiest ways to explore the genre is to watch the most accessible and available content and use that as a springboard for a more thorough exploration.
Fortunately, there is plenty of available and accessible mecha anime content to explore and much of the best of it has occurred within the last five years. On the one hand, the content adheres to the classic idea of mecha - robots so fully integrated into human society that they are almost taken for granted. On the other hand, the content takes into account and addresses contemporary sensibilities on a range of current issues from gender equality to sexual identity, racism to technological creep. Below are the 10 mecha anime that came out recently and are easily accessible and available.









 








 10  SSSS Dynazenon 
        

The Gridman series is the most interesting mecha anime franchise to have come out in years. It&#39;s also one that&#39;s been slowly gaining in global popularity since its debut in 2018. It’s a mecha anime universe that encapsulates the mood of the contemporary anime fan base. SSSS Dynazenon, which is the second series in the franchise, follows the story of high school student Yomogi Asanaka who along with three other people he previously never knew, is tasked with operating a giant mecha to fight an equally large kajiu monster threatening their city. With elements of Ultraman - whose creators are one of the producers of the series - and classic super sentai, SSSS Dynazenon is a great series to explore the newer trends in mecha anime.





 9  NieR: Automata Ver1.1a 
        

Adapted from the wildly popular video game, NieR: Automata Ver1.1a has something few other first-time non-manga-based anime series have, namely a deep and detailed, ready-made, fan-tested universe to draw from. And the producers made excellent use of the content they had access to. As a result, fans get a visually stunning performance that incorporates elements of the video game experience. As more video games are adapted into anime, there is no doubt that future mecha anime will follow the NieR: Automata model of anime-game integration. There’s also its rather compelling story surrounding the issue of whether mecha can reach such a high level of sophistication that they can become human-like or, at least, they begin to believe that they are human.





 8  Promare 
        

The fact that Promare was created by the makers of the stellar mecha anime Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann should be enough to convince any fan of – or interested in – the genre that it is worth watching. There’s also the fact that it&#39;s the first full-length animated feature release from Studio Trigger – the makers of such well-received works as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and Star Wars: Visions. Most important, however, is its content and delivery. While the story of a band of heroes courageously taking out an existential threat is nothing new, the characters who make up the team are truly worthy of the viewer&#39;s attention even when the story slows. Regarding delivery, the Studio Trigger ultra-stylized format is mesmerizing and almost worth viewing it in and of itself.





 7  Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury 
        

No other franchise has been more influential in the development of mecha anime than Mobile Suit Gundam. It revolutionized the idea of human-piloted mecha rather than the more traditional autonomous mecha working alongside a human partner. The Witch of Mercury flips the script by featuring an autonomous mecha that is powered by the soul of a human. It’s a great twist that creates a new hybrid mecha update with a lot of potential for the franchise and beyond. In addition, in keeping with Mobile Suit Gundam’s revolutionary tendencies, The Witch of Mercury also introduces the first female lead role as well as Gundam&#39;s first suggested same-sex romantic relationship. All this wrapped in the customarily compelling Mobile Suit Gundam story makes this a great all-around mecha anime series.





 6  Gridman Universe 
        

Gridman Universe, is the third and latest production in the Gridman series of mecha anime. It brings together SSSS Gridman and SSSS Dynazenon in a story that links the characters of the two stories. Indeed, as a result of the collision of two universes the SSSS Dynazenon team is trapped in SSSS Gridman’s reality. With new kaiju monsters on the loose, the two mecha teams collaborate not only to take down the monsters but also to figure out a way to return the Dynazenon members to their own reality. The film offers a great way to connect the franchise series while also setting up ongoing issues. Judging by the popularity of the franchise, the creators are sure to explore later. It also makes a great introduction to a franchise that looks to be around for a while.





 5  Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection 
        

Code Gaess: Lelouch of the Re;surrection has all the elements of a must-see mecha anime. There’s political intrigue, dashing young heroes, dazzling action, and, of course, shiny cool mecha. It’s a continuation of the Code Geass three-part film - Initiation, Transgression, and Glorification, which reinterprets the older original Code Geass anime series. That series was one of the most popular mecha anime of that time. However, the most important reason to watch the film now is to prepare for the upcoming Code Geass: Z of the Recapture. While little is known about the highly anticipated new anime, rumors suggest it might continue the timeline established in the films rather than the original television series. As such Re;surrection will provide the necessary background and context for the new anime.





 4  Mobile Suite Gundam: The Origin - The Advent of the Red Comet 
        

One of the issues with a franchise as big and diverse as Mobile Suit Gundam is that it&#39;s easy to get so caught up in the numerous alternate stories that it’s easy to forget the one that started it all. Mobile Suit Gundam – The Origin: The Advent of the Red Comet returns to the origin story by telling it from a different perspective, namely that of a younger Char Aznable as he watches or experiences the transformation of Zeon into a military powerhouse capable of taking on the Earth Federation. As Mobile Suit Gundam is required viewing for any mecha anime fan, Red Comet gives an interesting summarized introduction to the franchise that can be used as a base to explore its other copious side tales.





 3  Evangelion: 3.0 &#43; 1.0 Thrice Upon a Time 
        

The influence of the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise on the mecha anime genre is outstanding. As such, it is essential viewing for anyone interested in fully understanding and enjoying the mecha anime experience. However, it’s not a story that its creator has made easy for fans to understand. Even veteran watchers will confess to being confused at some point. Evangelion 3.0 &#43;1.0 Thrice Upon A Time is the perfect anime to get a taste of what the Evangelion franchise is about without too much time investment. Diehard fans will love it as a coda to the original series. New viewers, though, get a compelling self-contained story with enough questions to make them want to explore the franchise deeper.





 2  86 - Eighty Six 
        

One of the critiques of mecha anime is that it tends to emphasize action to the detriment of the story and characters. None of that can be said of 86 - Eighty Six. While it offers plenty of eye-popping action, the fights are not the rule. Rather, the action is more often used to support the compelling heavily character-based story of the manipulation of the “Eight Six” - a minority group of the Republic of San Magnolia who are forced by the majority Alba race to pilot the mecha used to fight the drones of their enemies. However, things change when an Alban leader of an Eighty Six squad decides to help them rather than simply control them.





 1  Pluto 
        

Osamu Tezuko’s Astro Boy is the character that not only helped start the Japanese anime industry but also was a founding member of the mecha anime genre. He helped define the autonomous mecha story that dominated the industry’s earliest days. Accordingly, it&#39;s fitting that Astro Boy finds himself again at the center of the anime universe in Netflix&#39;s Pluto. However, Pluto is not all about Astro Boy. In fact, he plays a secondary role. Pluto is worth watching for its creative transformation of a fairly standard Astro Boy story into a captivating, physiological murder mystery about the hunt for an unidentified serial killer of robots and humans. It&#39;s the type of high-level production where even if you already know the ending, you are still shocked to see it again.
As one of the first and most popular forms of Japanese animation, there is an amazing amount of great mecha anime for fans to try out and enjoy. However, for fans wanting easily available and accessible content, the ten great mecha anime mentioned above are what fans looking for quality viewing options should be focusing on.
