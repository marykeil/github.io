## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons just introduced the third member of the Ancient Adventurer&#39;s party, the most powerful Pokémon trainer in history.





The Ancient Adventurer Lucius was previously established to be a hero who traveled far and wide across the Pokémon world, and put together a powerful team of Pokémon to help him on his journey. The first of these Pokémon was the one contained within the Ancient Poké Ball that Roy had, the shiny Black Rayquaza, while the second contained a Titan-sized Arboliva, which the heroes found in a forest which had recently been ravaged by wildfire. While looking for Rayquaza, which escaped once released from its ball, the crew stumbled across the third member of Lucius&#39; team: a Galarian Moltres, hiding out in the mines of Galar.





 Galarian Moltres Proves To Be A Formidable Opponent In Pokémon Horizons 
          

The Galarian Moltres, which appeared in anime form for the first time in episode #22 of Pokémon Horizons, was shown to be quite dangerous. Simply being in its presence sapped Roy and Liko of their strength, at least until they were able to push through with sheer determination. Captain Pikachu went up against Moltres to try to protect the kids, but found himself outmatched and forced to take several powerful attacks. The kids were barely able to get away, and Moltres aggressively chased them as they attempted to escape in a mine cart, causing a cave-in as the passageway collapsed behind them.

As another Legendary Pokémon, Galarian Moltres is certainly an impressive addition to any anime trainer&#39;s team. There seems to be something wrong with it that&#39;s causing it to be so aggressive and dangerous, but exactly what hasn&#39;t yet been revealed. Lucius&#39; Pokémon seem to have been left behind all across the world, so that they might continue to protect the world in his absence. If it&#39;s anything like Arboliva, it may have come to this mine to protect the area, but grew enraged after some sort of devastation befell the area. It also looks like the Black Rayquaza may be checking in on its former teammates, rather than soaring around at random.

The episode ended on a cliffhanger, with Moltres causing that cave-in while Friede and Amethio were still inside the mine, so exactly what will become of Moltres isn&#39;t yet known. Galarian Moltres may be a bit too powerful to entrust to Liko and Roy at this point, so perhaps it will escape like Rayquaza, or return to its ball and simply be impossible to call out at will. With half of the Ancient Adventurer&#39;s team now revealed, it&#39;s looking like this character may truly deserve the reputation of being the strongest trainer in history, and fans of Pokémon Horizons can look forward to finding out the next three.
