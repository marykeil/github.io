# 10 Best Candidates for One Piece s Final Straw Hat


## SUMMARY 


 The Straw Hat crew is looking for their tenth and final member, and fans are debating who it should be. Several characters, such as Kin&#39;emon, Boa Hancock, and Sabo have qualities that would make them great additions. 
 Boa Hancock is a potential candidate, with her power, close relationship with Luffy, and aid to the crew. However, her leadership of an island and large crew make her an unlikely choice. 
 Yamato is perhaps the most popular pick to be the Straw Hat&#39;s final member, as his golden heart and presence in the series left a strong impact on the 
One Piece
 community.

## Literature Review

With Jimbei joining the crew as the ninth member of the Strawhats, 1 more spot remains, and these ten are a great fit.




The Straw Hat crew in One Piece is one of the most iconic groups in shonen anime and Luffy carefully selected the members to become one of the strongest and best pirate crews. The members are as different as night and day, and some don&#39;t even see eye to eye but what unites them is the desire to make Luffy&#39;s and each other&#39;s dreams come true.
Luffy expressed his desire to have only ten members join the ship, and with Jimbei officially joining the crew as the ninth member, fans are heavily debating who should be the tenth and final member of the crew. The series has introduced a number of stellar supporting characters that could potentially fill this spot, which has led to ample discussion among the One Piece community.
            
 
 10 Best One Piece Episodes Ranked 
There are many to choose from but the best One Piece episodes have fantastic animation, epic villains, and significant events taking place.












 








 10  Fox Fire Kin&#39;emon Already Sailed With The Crew 
        

The leader of the Akazaya Nine is the least likely to join, but he has all the qualifications to be a Straw Hat. He was on the Thousand Sunny ship wiht the rest of the group during the Punk Hazard and Dressrosa Arcs with Momonusuke. Kin&#39;emon got along with the other members pretty well, particularly Chopper and Usopp who he shared their love for robots with. He is very dependable, with a will and determination of steel and strength to back it up. Kin&#39;emon most likely won&#39;t join as he will be rebuilding Wano along with Momonosuke and working on opening up the borders as per the will of his deceased mentor Oden.





 9  Boa Hancock Is In Love With Luffy 
        

The Amazon Lily Arc revealed a potential romantic interest for Luffy when it introduced the Warlord, Boa Hancock. Like Kin&#39;emon she&#39;s an unlikely candidate but ticks all the boxes to join the crew. As a former warlord, her name is known far and wide and is very powerful. Her devil fruit powers are deadly, and she is very proficient in Haki. She&#39;s also very close to Luffy, and has aided him many times, but it&#39;s very unsure how she&#39;ll get along with the male-majority crew. She also has an island to protect and her own very large crew to lead, which makes her an unlikely candidate.





 8  Sabo Fits Perfectly Into The Crew 
        

As Luffy&#39;s older brother, Sabo is an obvious contender. His fun and laid-back personality will make him easily adjust into the crew, and he would surely hit it off with Brook and Zoro. As a top commander of the Revolutionary Army, he was already powerful but him acquiring Ace&#39;s Flame-Flame Fruit in the Dressrosa Arc makes him even more powerful. He has the character, the strength and the influence to join, plus his goal of taking down Blackbeard and The World Government is the same as Luffy. However, he is way too valuable to leave the Revolutionary Army, but fans can hope the two work together in the end.
            
 
 One Piece&#39;s Sabo Finally Steps Out of Ace&#39;s Shadow With Genius Move 
A big problem with Sabo&#39;s character has always been how much he was overshadowed by Ace, but chapter 1083 finally fixes that in a genius way.








 7  The Crew Already Loves Carrot 
        

Similar to Kin&#39;emon, Carrot has traveled with the crew since the Zou Arc, but she built a strong rapport with the crew and filled an important position in her short time with them. She is loved by the members, and is very close with Usopp, Chopper and Sanji. She served as the crew&#39;s lookout, as she would often be at the top of the ship with binoculars. This is a very important in an age where pirates and marines can attack at any moment. Like all the others before her, Carrot has people and a home she has to take care of. Her strength and personality would have undoubtedly made the straw hats more likable.





 6  Vivi Can Join Whenever She Wants 
        

During the Alabasta Arc, Luffy told Vivi that she can join anytime she wants to which makes her the likeliest candidate – but not the best. She&#39;s loved by the crew, and her bubbly personality would fit in well. She&#39;s also a princess and the connections her title comes with especially in the World Government would be invaluable. Most of all, she would join with her pet duck Karoo who she&#39;s always with. The only downside to her joining is that she is really weak. Every other member has at least some combat abilities so her becoming a member would only burden the rest.





 5  Koby 
        

Koby is a Navy captain and him joining a pirate crew after being tormented by one in his childhood sounds insane but there&#39;s good reason for it. First and most importantly, he knows Luffy personally and his morals. He knows that he isn&#39;t the average looting pirate, and Luffy even saved him. So Koby wouldn&#39;t be opposed to being a pirate if it was with the Straw Hats. Besides, a navy becoming a pirate isn&#39;t unheard of when Aokiji left the marines and became a pirate. Koby is very strong as well and his past with Luffy and Zoro would surely make him a loyal member.





 4  Bon Clay Possesses The Number One Quality In A Member 
        

All the crew members have demonstrated their loyalty to Luffy and the crew, but they only did so after joining the Straw Hats. Bon Clay, however, risked his career and life twice just so Luffy could escape, once in the Alabasta Arc and the second in Impel Down when Luffy wanted to break out to save Ace. His unwavering and fierce loyalty to Luffy easily makes him a great fit, and his pompous and over-the-top personality will easily make him a fan favorite. Like Hancock, he has an island to lead and look over, but fans can only hope he makes his appearance again and is invited to join.





 3  Trafalgar Law Already Allied With Luffy Once 
        

Law is the most unique member of the Worst Generation because he is very powerful and brilliant, but his crew hold him back in terms of strength, despite their fierce loyalty. Law would be a great addition to the Straw Hats because he already allied with Luffy once before to take down Kaido and Doflamingo. His expertise as a doctor and brains as a tactician would be a great addition to the pirates but that seems far out of reach as Law prefers to have his own crew. Maybe he can lead Luffy&#39;s Grand Fleet in the future but joining the crew won&#39;t happen as long as Law stays stubborn.





 2  Yamato Is The Most Popular Pick 
        

Yamato is the fan favorite pick for the last member and there&#39;s good reason. Besides stealing everyone&#39;s heart during the Wano Arc, he&#39;s insanely powerful and managed to stall Kaido in his most powerful form until Luffy arrived. He&#39;s a very fun person to be around and instantly clicked with the crew. Despite growing up around the evil Animal Pirates, Yamato has a heart of gold and extends kindness to anyone.He&#39;d also make a great adventurer as her role model Oden Kozuki also sailed the seas. As soon as Wano is safe enough and won&#39;t need his protection, Yamato would be the best person to join.

Fans of One Piece can hold on to the hope that, after all the teasing, Yamato will eventually join the Straw Hat Pirates in the near future.








 1  Marco Joining Would Have The Biggest Impact 
        

The former lieutenant of the Whitebeard Pirates, Marco has helped Luffy on more than one occasion, particularly in the Wano Arc when he took on Big Mom and the Lead Performers. Him joining would benefit the crew more than anyone else on this list. The biggest benefit would be they would have one of the strongest characters in the series. Marco joining would also be the trigger for the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates joining. They have a grudge against Blackbeard, so their goals align with the crew&#39;s. They were always friendly with Luffy so Marco joining would definitely convince them to follow suit. A big misconception is that Marco is too old for the crew at 45 years old, but Jimbei is 46 – and Brook is 90.
As mentioned, none of these candidates are perfect, and they have their flaws, but they are definitely the best for the slot. It&#39;s also worth noting that Oda has expressed a limit of ten, but he said other things that he later went back on, so fans still have hope that some or all these characters will join. For now, these are the best candidates to be the final member of the Straw Hat Pirates.
