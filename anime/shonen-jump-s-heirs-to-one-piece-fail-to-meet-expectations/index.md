# Shonen Jump s Heirs To One Piece Fail To Meet Expectations


## SUMMARY 



  Shonen Jump&#39;s NEXTWAVE project was launched to find a replacement for popular manga like One Piece, resulting in new titles like Kagurabachi and Mama YuYu.   However, these new manga aren&#39;t popular among Japanese readers, as indicated by their low placement on the Table of Contents (ToC) in Weekly Shonen Jump.   Despite their lack of popularity in Japan, the magazine is still trying to increase the manga&#39;s popularity by giving them special color issues and considering overseas fans&#39; positive reception.

## Literature Review

Three manga that were made to replace One Piece and Shonen Jump&#39;s biggest manga are performing poorly popularity-wise reveals a new poll.




As Shonen Jump&#39;s biggest and most popular manga, One Piece seems almost impossible to replace. The series is a household name in the anime community and globally, partly because it has received many adaptations, such as games and live-action. Naturally, the company has been working on its replacement since the series is approaching its end.




In response to the many hit manga nearing their conclusion, such as My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen, Shonen Jump&#39;s NEXTWAVE project was launched to scout for the next big thing.

         

This led to new titles such as Kagurabachi, Mama YuYu, and Two On Ice being introduced. Unfortunately, while Kagurabachi seemed like it was successful, their placement in the latest issue of Shonen Jump spells trouble for the three new manga.

                  Shonen Jumps Begins Title Culling To Make Room For New NEXTWAVE Project   Shonen Jump is once again canceling a promising new manga. The difference this time is it&#39;s also introducing three titles as part of a new campaign.   


 Kagurabachi &amp; Two On Ice Come in Last in Shonen Jump&#39;s Table of Contents 

 




Although the sales for Shonen Jump&#39;s new manga aren&#39;t available yet, there is another way to discern their popularity. The Table of Contents, commonly referred to as ToC, is a guide that lets readers know which page a manga is found on in the Weekly Shonen Jump publication. Although it is simply nothing more than a guide on the surface, many readers speculate that a series&#39; placement reflects its popularity. Series that are higher up on the ToC are usually the more popular ones. However, sometimes, popular manga like Undead Unluck and My Hero Academia end up being placed at the bottom, which isn&#39;t an indication of popularity but instead, is just a positioning strategy.

The ToC is even more reliable when it comes to newer series. Historically, series in their first year that consistently end up being ranked at the bottom of the guide usually end up getting canceled. According to a post by X User Cer_Clover, since 1997, 96 percent of the manga in their first year that place low on the ToC are axed. Unfortunately, this is a bad sign for Kagurabachi, Two on Ice, and Mama Yuyu. This is surprising, especially for Kagurabachi since the series has fans in a frenzy with its clean art and plot reminiscent of that of Jujutsu Kaisen. In fact, it is one of the most popular manga on Manga Plus, Shonen Jump&#39;s international manga streaming service.






 Signs Point to Kagurabachi, Two on Ice, &amp; Mama Yuyu Being Canceled 

 

As much as the two series are loved by fans worldwide, their placement at last in Shonen Jump&#39;s table of contents suggests they aren&#39;t popular with Japanese fans. As worrisome as this news is, Shonen Jump seems to be giving both manga a color issue in an attempt to increase their popularity. Fans can still rest easy knowing that the magazine is looking for ways to avoid a cancelation, given how much of a hit they are with overseas fans. Although the statistics from Shonen Jump&#39;s ToC do seem reliable, sales are much more indicative of demand, and until the data is published, fans should take such rumors with a grain of salt.

Read Kagurabachi

Read MamaYuYu

Read Two On Ice
