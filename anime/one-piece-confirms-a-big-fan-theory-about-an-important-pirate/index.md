## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s Egghead adventure basically confirmed that fans have been right on the money about Jewelry Bonney and her true age.





The theory was initially fueled by fan translations of Chapter #1089 where St. Saturn referred to Bonney as a &#39;little girl.&#39; Though the official release cleared up the misunderstanding by having Saturn refer to her as &#39;just a girl,&#39; the theory continued to gain momentum as fans noticed Bonney&#39;s childlike behavior throughout Egghead as well as the intricacies of her Devil Fruit powers. Having said that, Vegapunk says something peculiar in chapter #1093 of One Piece, implying Bonney may truly be younger than she lets on. When Vegapunk heads out to save Bonney who is stranded on the Fabriophase, he states that he cannot leave the &#39;poor little child&#39; behind. While the instance involving St. Saturn was still open to interpretation, Vegapunk&#39;s comment makes it hard to dismiss the two instances as a mere coincidence.

 Vegapunk Describes Bonney A Little Child In One Piece 
          

Far-fetched as it sounds, several pieces of evidence point towards Jewelry Bonney being younger than she seems, particularly the fact that she appeared to be in child form when the Straw Hats first discovered her in the warm eddy outside Egghead in Chapter #1060. Assuming the seawater negated the effects of her Devil Fruit, that may have very well been Bonney&#39;s true form. More importantly, when Bonney turned Vegapunk into a child in Chapter #1072, &#39;gems of experience&#39; seemed to pop out of him, indicating the years of knowledge he has accumulated over the years. However, no such gems appeared when Bonney turned herself into a child in the very same chapter.




At any rate, as with any theory, this one too has its gaps and shortcomings. The theory depends heavily on incomplete information about Bonney&#39;s Devil Fruit and not only is One Piece infamously inconsistent when it comes to the specifics of Devil Fruit powers, but not much is known about Bonney&#39;s fruit other than that it is a Paramecia-type. There is also the contradicting fact that Bonney has mentioned visiting Egghead before as a child, though that can still be dismissed as her seeing her younger self from a few years ago as a child, as children often do.



 Bonney Is Still Hiding Many Secrets 
          

Regardless of whether she is a child or a clone of Big Mom as another theory claims, one can&#39;t deny that there&#39;s definitely more to Jewelry Bonney than meets the eye. Nonetheless, only time will tell how many more secrets Bonney has in store, how these will affect the events on Egghead, and the part she will play in the Straw Hats&#39; great adventure.
