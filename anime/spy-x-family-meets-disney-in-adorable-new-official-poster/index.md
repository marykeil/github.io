## Literature Review

In an unexpected crossover no one saw coming, Spy x Family and Disney&#39;s Wish officially teamed up in Japan to promote the upcoming film Code: WHITE.




The hit anime Spy x Family has made an official crossover with Disney&#39;s latest film with a new movie poster for the series&#39; upcoming movie, Code: WHITE. The hype for the Forgers&#39; first movie since Spy x Family became a huge hit with fans is indescribable. While international audiences will need to wait until 2024 to see the Forger family&#39;s most thrilling adventure yet, Code: WHITE will be officially premiering early for fans in Japan on December 22nd. To prepare for this, the film has made an unexpected official crossover with Disney&#39;s latest movie, Wish.




Since Wish was finally released in Japan on December 15th, WIT Studio and Disney have officially collaborated with a genius piece of marketing for both films. According to Crunchyroll, the latest poster for Spy x Family: Code: WHITE features Anya and Bond reaching out to a falling Stella star, something she needs to earn at Eden Academy to further Loid&#39;s mission, in a direct reference to Wish&#39;s own banner. What&#39;s better is that the two are a direct mirror of each other, showing Anya and Wish&#39;s protagonist Asha essentially reaching out to their own wishing star on the same night.

          

It&#39;s a beautifully constructed piece of marketing to celebrate the release of Disney&#39;s latest movie and Japan&#39;s most anticipated movie based on an anime releasing in such a short timeframe. What&#39;s even better is how this perfect poster relates to Anya thematically.





 Spy x Family&#39;s Collaboration with Wish is a Perfect Fit for Anya 

 

Even though Wish didn&#39;t meet the high expectations fans had for Disney&#39;s 100th-anniversary film with a disappointing box office to reflect it, the themes revolving around wishes fit perfectly with Anya when looking at her feelings about being part of the Forgers. In a way, being adopted by Loid was her own &#34;wish come true&#34; moment because she now has everything she&#39;s ever wanted. She has a father and mother that she can love, even if Loid just created it as cover to further his own interests, as well as the excitement of knowing her parents&#39; double lives as a spy and assassin.

Anya even got to enjoy a brief princess-like moment during the season 1 episode &#34;Will They Pass or Fail&#34; when Loid treats her to a re-enactment of a Spy Wars episode to celebrate her getting into Eden Academy. Wish was tailor-made for a collaboration with Anya from Spy X Family, and it shows in how well constructed the marketing turned out with both the poster and an amazing hybrid trailer by Disney&#39;s Japanese YouTube channel to promote both films.






 Wish Wasn&#39;t Spy x Family&#39;s First Movie Collab in 2023 
          

What&#39;s surprising about this collab with Disney is that they&#39;re not the first ones to tease the much-anticipated Spy x Family film before its release. Back in July 2023, the latest Mission: Impossible film, Dead Reckoning-Part One, also collaborated with WIT Studio to promote both films, even though Code: WHITE wouldn&#39;t be released till much later. Similar to their work with Disney, the marketing tied in pretty well with the premise of Spy x Family, though it&#39;s far more direct than how the film ties in with Wish. After all, both deal with spies on a mission to save the world, so the connection is pretty obvious. Still, the resulting poster art was a beautiful recreation of Dead Reckoning&#39;s with the Forgers and other iconic characters filling in the shoes of Ethan Hunt and his team.




While international audiences will need to wait a bit longer to finally see the Forgers&#39; first movie, Code: WHITE, in theaters, the marketing in Japan surrounding its impending release has been incredible. The Forgers have become such a phenomenon since the anime first debuted in 2022, so to see such big movie studios reach out to collab with them is a massive win for the franchise. Spy x Family&#39;s team-up with Disney managed to create Code: WHITE&#39;s most adorable official poster yet, and it&#39;s doing its job to hype up the film&#39;s release in the best way possible.
