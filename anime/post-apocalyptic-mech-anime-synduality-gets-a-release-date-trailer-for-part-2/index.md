## Literature Review

Synduality: Noir got a fresh trailer that hints at how the adventure of Kanata will continue in a back half that promises grander stakes and battles.




Mecha anime Synduality: Noir, currently streaming on Disney&#43;, received a new trailer showcasing the contents of its second half, which premieres next January. After an easygoing beginning, Kanata and his friends look ready to tackle overarching threats that are coming to the fore. The footage also reveals the new theme songs that will accompany the anime when it returns to the screen.




Synduality: Noir ended its first cours with a major shift in circumstances for Kanata and his team. With audiences now more than familiar with the cast, 8-bit seems ready to throw them into more wringers, as Kanata takes on Macht and the conspiracy that had been rumbling in the background.


 

Hopefully,, it will provide enough exciting mech action to satisfy fans of the genre when it begins broadcast.

Warning: Spoilers for Synduality: Noir&#39;s First CourThe new trailer, which has been uploaded to Emotion Label&#39;s YouTube Channel, shows that the new cours immediately follows the events of &#34;Mirage of the ideal&#34;. Noir&#39;s personality still appears to be out of action, now replaced by the irascible but more powerful Mystere, forcing Kanata to learn about his partner all over again. Meanwhile, Weisheit, a villain who loomed in the background, may become a more active presence in the plot now. With the trailer focusing on an inevitable showdown between Kanata and Macht, it&#39;s clear the 2nd half is preparing to answer the questions it set up beforehand.




Other details revealed by the trailer include the new theme songs selected. STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION and ARCANA PROJECT, who did the first part&#39;s opening and endings respectively, will return. &#34;Aire&#34; by ARANA PROJECT will be Synduality: Noir&#39;s second opening, while &#34;Drifters&#34; by SDF will close out each episode. The anime will premiere in Japan on January 8, while it will stream overseas on Disney&#43; beginning January 9. Previously, Synduality: Noir&#39;s episodes were provided by both Disney&#43; and Hulu, which served US audiences, but currently only Disney has been confirmed to be streaming the second half of the upcoming anime.

With its emphasis on characters, familiar archetypes, and individually distinct machines, Synduality: Noir makes for a good gateway into the mecha sub-genre for viewers who may be put off by bleak war stories or visually interchangeable, mass-produced robots. While the episodic structure and lightheartedness from earlier might be hit-or-miss, the promise of more serious combat scenes and plot progression means that the show has a clear goal in mind. With January only a few weeks away, Synduality: Noir looks like it will be making 2024 a welcome start to the mecha genre, as it returns to its unique post-apocalyptic world.
