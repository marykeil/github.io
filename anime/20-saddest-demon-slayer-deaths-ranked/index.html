  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Demon slayers understand the high risk of dying in battle with demons, yet they choose to fight anyway, earning the respect of fans.
Tragic deaths occur not only among demon slayers but also noncombatants and demons themselves.
Characters like Susamaru, Yuichiro, and Kanae had tragic deaths, showcasing the emotional depth of the series. #DemonSlayer</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Deaths are unavoidable in Demon Slayer, as characters constantly fight for their lives. Some deaths are sadder than others, though.</p>
<p>One thing fans of Demon Slayer appreciate about the series is its somewhat more realistic take on combat. No matter how skilled, an above-average human going up against a demon with regenerative abilities and Blood Demon Arts is going to struggle, and the odds of dying in battle are high. For demon slayers, it&rsquo;s understood that they will most likely die in combat with a demon, and yet they choose to battle on anyway, earning the respect and admiration of fans.
Of course, some character deaths will hit fans harder than others. When it comes to tragic deaths, one doesn&rsquo;t have to be a slayer; there are plenty of tragic passings from noncombatants and even the demons themselves as well. Needless to say, this involves MAJOR SPOILERS, and goes beyond what has aired in the anime thus far. Those hoping to avoid spoilers, read no further!</p>
<p>20  Susamaru
Killed by Muzan&rsquo;s Curse</p>
<p>Susamaru was the Temari demon, a young woman who attacked Tanjiro while he was with Lady Tamayo alongside her compatriot, Yahaba. Susamaru had an immature, childlike personality and was fanatically devoted to Muzan, believing herself to be one of his Twelve Kizuki. Throughout her battle with Tanjiro, it became clear that Susamaru was likely turned into a demon while she was still a child, a tragic fate to be sure. This only gets sadder when she becomes enraged at insults against Muzan and attempts to defend him. She accidentally invokes his name, causing her to be killed by Muzan&rsquo;s curse. Her last words are to beg for her Temari ball back, showing that inside, she was still that child.</p>
<p>19  Yuichiro Tokito
Killed By a Demon While Protecting Tokito</p>
<p>The twin brother of Demon Slayer&rsquo;s Mist Hashira, Muichiro Tokito, Yuichiro had a rude personality, and lived alongside his brother alone after their parents both died. One night, a demon attacked their hut out of nowhere, ripping Yuichiro&rsquo;s arm off when he attempted to defend his brother. While Muichiro eventually got himself together and defeated the demon, Yuichiro was already nearly dying of blood loss, but the last words he spoke were a prayer to ensure that at least Muichiro would live. In other Demon Slayer media, it&rsquo;s implied that Yuichiro had the potential to be a great Hashira himself, so his death isn&rsquo;t just tragic for the senseless loss of a young life, but also for the great warrior who never got a chance to fight.</p>
<p>18  Kanae Kocho
Fatally Wounded By The Upper 2 Demon Doma</p>
<p>Kanae Kocho is the older sister of Shinobu and the former Flower Hashira. Kanae was killed before the series began, but that doesn&rsquo;t make her death any less tragic. Kanae found herself in battle against the Upper 2 demon, Doma, and dealt severe damage to him, forcing him to retreat before the sun could rise. Kanae, however, suffered fatal damage, and with her dying words begged her sister to leave the Demon Slayer Corps so that she wouldn&rsquo;t suffer the same fate. Shinobu disregarded her sister&rsquo;s wishes, however, instead hoping for revenge&hellip; a decision which ultimately led to another tragic death.</p>
<p>17  Yoriichi Tsugikuni
Died From Exertion While Fighting Muzan</p>
<p>Yoriichi Tsugikuni was the original creator of Demon Slayer&rsquo;s Breathing Styles and the only master of the Sun Breathing style. Yoriichi was an incredible swordsman, and remained so well into his eighties, when he faced Muzan Kibutsuji. Yoriichi very nearly killed Muzan then and there, potentially stopping decades more of his reign of terror, but the exertion was too much for his old body, and Yoriichi died partway through his finishing blow. While Yoriichi had a long life and a fantastic legacy, it&rsquo;s tragic that he wasn&rsquo;t able to finish the job and kill Muzan himself, although he did psychologically scar Muzan in ways that still haunt him in Demon Slayer&rsquo;s present.</p>
<p>16  Kotoha Hashibira
Eaten By Doma While Trying to Protect Inosuke</p>
<p>Kotoha Hashibira was the mother of Demon Slayer fan-favorite Inosuke Hashibira. After giving birth to Inosuke, she had to escape from her abusive husband to protect his child and ended up in the cult led by the Upper Moon 2, Doma, who took a liking to her and spared her life. After realizing that Doma was a demon, she attempted to escape, which was futile, as Doma managed to chase her down to a cliff. Fans were heartbroken by Kotoha&rsquo;s decision to throw Inosuke into a river, hoping that he could survive, while Kotoha dies being eaten by Doma. Despite being an infant, Inosuke somehow remembers his mother&rsquo;s sacrifice, adding another layer of sadness to it.</p>
<p>15  Kie Kamado &amp; The Kamado Family
Slaughtered By Muzan</p>
<p>Kie Kamado is Tanjiro&rsquo;s mother. Already a single mother providing for six children in a backwoods area, Kie proved herself to be a loving and caring mother. Unfortunately, in the very beginning of the series, Muzan Kibutsuji comes by and kills Kie, as well as Tanjiro&rsquo;s 4 younger siblings, ruthlessly slaughtering them in their own home for no real reason. Tanjiro tragically discovered the bloodbath and found Nezuko wasn&rsquo;t dead like the rest. This tragic event kicks off Tanjiro&rsquo;s journey to become a Demon Slayer, and serves as the driving motivation for him to do all the dangerous things that he does.</p>
<p>14  Iguro Obanai
Succumbed to His Wounds After Fighting Muzan</p>
<p>The Snake Hashira, Iguro Obanai didn&rsquo;t exactly endear himself to fans in his first appearance, where he voted to kill Nezuko and was unwilling to hear otherwise. Iguro was born as the only boy in his family after centuries. His family had become wealthy from a demon giving them riches in exchange for people to eat. Due to being a male, he was spared just a little longer by the demon, who scarred his face to resemble a snake. This gave him an intense hatred of demons, and spurred him to become a slayer and eventually Hashira.
Iguro is still a Hashira who bravely fought against demons, including Muzan Kibutsuji in Demon Slayer&rsquo;s final battle. One of his final acts was trying to save a fellow Hashira, Mitsuri, after she suffered major injuries. Iguro Obanai died not long after the battle ended, so he was at least able to rest knowing they were successful. His final thoughts were of reuniting with Mitsuri in their next life, ending their quiet love story in tragedy.</p>
<p>13  Lady Tamayo
Skull Crushed By Muzan</p>
<p>Lady Tamayo was one of the first demons created by Muzan. Suffering from a fatal disease, she allowed herself to be turned into a demon so that she would be able to see her family grow up. Unfortunately, after being transformed, she ended up killing her entire family instead, and several more people once she realized what she&rsquo;d done. She was eventually freed from Muzan&rsquo;s control after the Demon King was defeated, but not killed, by Demon Slayer&rsquo;s strongest fighter, Yoriichi Tsugikuni. She became one of Muzan&rsquo;s biggest opponents, and faced him in the final battle alongside the Hashira, attempting to poison him with a special drug designed to weaken him. While he was successfully poisoned, Lady Tamayo was killed, and her last words were a heartbreaking plea for her family back.</p>
<p>12  Kyogai
Slain By Tanjiro</p>
<p>The Drum Demon Kyogai was a former member of the Twelve Kizuki who had lost his rank and was desperate to get it back. He was also once a human who aspired to be a writer and longed to be recognized for his work. When he first became a demon, he was a star, rapidly growing stronger, but eventually this exponential growth waned, and Kyogai hit a ceiling. He became obsessed with finding humans with &ldquo;rare blood&rdquo; that might help him grow stronger, in hopes that might ingratiate him with Muzan again. Kyogai was killed by Tanjiro, but Tanjiro took a moment to respect and appreciate Kyogai&rsquo;s drum ability, something which brought the demon peace in the end.</p>
<p>11  Kokushibo
Allows Himself to Be Slain by the Demon Slayers</p>
<p>The Upper Moon 1, Kokushibo, is Muzan&rsquo;s strongest demo in Demon Slayer. Before turning into a demon, he was a demon slayer named Michikatsu Tsugikuni, who was extremely jealous of his brother Yoriichi&rsquo;s unnatural talents. After receiving the Demon Slayer Mark, he let himself be transformed into a demon in order to live past the age of 25. Kokushibo never lost the desire to surpass Yoriichi after becoming a demon, which was fueled by seeing Yoriichi live to 85 and still retain his power. After centuries as a demon, he notices how ugly he has become and looks back, regretting his past decisions. Due to this sudden feeling, he allows the demon slayers finish him off. Kokushibo dies full of regret and hatred after a life of being second-best.</p>
<p>10  Gyomei Himejima
Succumbed to His Injuries After Facing Muzan</p>
<p>Gyomei, the Stone Hashira, was Demon Slayer&rsquo;s strongest Hashira of his generation. He is a blind man who once took care of several orphans, all of whom were killed after one sells them out to a demon. After beating up the demon, he was accused of killing the children, only to be released with the help of Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps. Gyomei was one of those who greatly contributed to defeating Muzan, and even declined to be treated for his injuries. In his death, he reunites with the dead children, who accept his apology for his actions. Gyomei died crying, with a smile on his face at the thought of being able to reunite with his loved ones again.</p>
<p>9  Jigoro Kuwajima
Slit His Own Stomach After Kaigaku Turned Into a Demon</p>
<p>The former Thunder Hashira, Jigoro, was the teacher of Zenitsu Agatsuma and Kaigaku. He wasn&rsquo;t particularly successful as a teacher, however, as Zenitsu only managed to learn the first of the six forms of Thunder Breathing Style, while Kaigaku learned everything but the first form. Jigoro&rsquo;s death wasn&rsquo;t in battle, but rather a ritual suicide. When his former pupil Kaigaku turned into a demon to save himself after losing to a powerful demon, Jigoro slit his own stomach. Jigoro Kuwajima died a slow and agonizing death, but he felt it was the only way to reclaim his honor from having a pupil go so far astray. It wasn&rsquo;t Jigoro&rsquo;s fault that Kaigaku betrayed him, which makes this death all the more tragic.</p>
<p>8  Rui
Decapitated By Tomioka</p>
<p>The Lower Moon 5 demon, Rui, was a demon who looked like a child and wanted nothing more than to have a family. As a demon, however, his sense of what it meant to be family was twisted, and he tortured the demons whom he forced into the roles of family members. Rui kept a calm demeanor for the most part, even when speaking to demon slayers, but he was highly unstable in reality. The Water Hashira decapitated him, and as Rui died, he accepted all the horrible things he did–only to see his real, human mother and father forgiving him for all that he&rsquo;s done. It&rsquo;s a tragic fate for a cursed child and a moving moment about the unconditional love between parent and child.</p>
<p>7  Shinobu Kocho
Absorbed By Doma</p>
<p>Shinobu Kocho is Demon Slayer&rsquo;s Insect Hashira and the sister of the deceased Flower Hashira, Kanae Kocho. As a kid, their parents were killed by a demon. Thankfully, they were saved by the Stone Hashira, Gyomei. They then resolved to become demon slayers to prevent deaths, but Kanae tragically died some years before the story started in battle with the Upper Moon 2 demon, Doma. When faced with the opportunity for revenge, Shinobu faltered and was unable to win against Doma. Doma attempted to absorb her after her defeat, but she had a lethal demon poison in her body, which weakened Doma substantially and helped her successor Kanao Tsuyuri finish him off. Thus, Shinobu&rsquo;s death made a noble sacrifice, but one that didn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>6  Kagaya Ubuyashiki
Sacrificed Himself to Wound Muzan</p>
<p>Kagaya Ubuyashiki is the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps. While he doesn&rsquo;t fight, he does organize and fund the group&rsquo;s efforts, making him an essential member of the team. Since he was introduced, he has suffered from a fatal illness, but that wasn&rsquo;t what got him in the end. Instead, when Muzan came to kill him, Kagaya greeted him without any animosity; this lulled Muzan into a false sense of security, and he detonated a bomb, destroying his mansion, killing Kagaya himself and his family, and wounding Muzan in the process. Kagaya&rsquo;s death is a sacrifice that didn&rsquo;t achieve much, though, and the fact that his family had to be sacrificed as well makes this one hurt particularly bad.</p>
<p>5  Genya Shinazugawa
Killed By Kokushibo</p>
<p>Genya is the brother of Demon Slayer&rsquo;s Wind Hashira, Sanemi, and one of the demon slayers who took the Final Selection with Tanjiro. Unlike the demon slayers who use breathing styles, he uses a gun and can eat demons to copy their Blood Demon Art. Despite this, he remained human, able to handle sunlight without issue. Genya was killed by the Upper Moon 1, Kokushibo, but not before helping the others take him down. As he was dying, his brother Sanemi regretted how strained their relationship have become, and wept as he begged the heavens to spare Genya. Like a demon, his body disintegrated as he died.</p>
<p>4  Muichiro Tokito
Succumbs to His Wounds After Battling Kokushibo</p>
<p>Muichiro is the Mist Hashira, and the youngest of all Hashira, even younger than protagonist Tanjiro Kamado. Despite being the youngest, he is also among the strongest, as he defeated Upper Moon 5 by himself. As a kid, his twin brother was killed by a demon, which prompted him to become a demon slayer. Muichiro eventually dies after succumbing to his wounds from his battle with Upper Moon 1, Kokushibo, who is also revealed to be his ancestor. After his death, he eventually meets with his deceased brother, who berates him for dying at a young age and not growing old. The tragic nature of Muichiro&rsquo;s death is made so much worse by his young age, as the boy still had so much left to live.</p>
<p>3  Akaza
Refused to Regenerate After Battling Giyuu &amp; Tanjiro</p>
<p>Born as Hakuji, Akaza has lived his entire life in misery. He was beaten several times while stealing to provide for his dying father, who ended up committing suicide to stop Hakuji&rsquo;s crimes. After being taken in by a martial arts master to take care of his sick daughter (who became Hakuji&rsquo;s fiancée), both were killed by a rival dojo. Hakuji ended up killing 47 kendo masters while unarmed and became a demon afterward. While fighting Giyuu and Tanjiro in Demon Slayer&rsquo;s Infinity Fortress, he remembers his depressing past and hears his dead loved ones begging him to stop. He tragically regained his humanity at the end, crying and apologizing. Akaza&rsquo;s sad death made him perhaps the most sympathetic demon.</p>
<p>2  Kyojuro Rengoku
Killed By Akaza</p>
<p>Kyojuro was the first Hashira to work with Tanjiro and his crew in the Demon Slayer: Mugen Train film. In the movie, he proved himself a reliable warrior and a friendly fellow, but fans&rsquo; time with him was tragically cut short when Akaza appeared, challenging him to a battle that would ultimately end in Kyojuro&rsquo;s death. He was intensely focused on protecting Tanjiro and the others, and his dying words were advice on how Tanjiro could master the Hinokami Kagura. Kyojuro died with a smile on his face, seeing his long-deceased mother welcoming him to the afterlife. What might be most heartbreaking about Kyojuro&rsquo;s death is how Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke react, as they lose a friend in battle for the first time.</p>
<p>1  Mitsuri Kanroji
Dead By Bleeding Out After Battle With Muzan</p>
<p>Demon Slayer&rsquo;s Love Hashira, Mitsuri Kanroji, was one of the kindest and most friendly of the Hashira. She was also a powerful warrior, but all she really wanted was love. She felt that only a man stronger than her could love her, so she worked hard to become a Hashira and meet the other Hashira, hoping her partner might be among them. Unfortunately, Mitsuri never got her wish. While battling with Muzan, she attacked viciously, losing both her arms in the process. She was evacuated from the battle by the Snake Hashira Iguro, and she begged him to promise he would return, yet he never did. Mitsuri ultimately died by bleeding out, and like Iguro, her last wishes were that they might be reincarnated together in the next life. Mitsuri&rsquo;s likability combined with the absolutely devastating nature of her death make this one hit particularly hard.
While individual fans may be impacted by certain character deaths differently, Demon Slayer&rsquo;s most tragic deaths stick out with just how compelling they are. It is a sign of how well-written the series is that both demon slayers and demons rank among the series&rsquo; saddest deaths. Demon Slayer is a series that doesn&rsquo;t pull its punches when it comes to deaths, after all, and that may well be one of the things fans love about it.
