That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is one of the most influential isekai series of all time, naturally leading many fans to wonder what are the best anime series similar to Rimuru&#39;s adventures. Isekai anime exploded in popularity in the last decade, meaning that fans have no shortage of anime series to watch.

 15  Beast Tamer (2022) 
Based on the light novel created by Suzu Miyama
        

  Number of Episodes   13    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
Beast Tamer is part of a recent trend of RPG anime that aren&#39;t quite isekai but still use many of the genre&#39;s tropes. The series follows the titular beast named Rein Shroud who is kicked out of his adventuring party for being too weak. Despite his apparent lack of power though, Rein&#39;s potential is off the charts as he can gain the power of any beast he makes a contract with. The inspiration from That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is fairly obvious in Beast Tamer, but far from a ripoff, the series does interesting things with its premise. Slime fans will definitely have a good time with this anime.

 14  My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom (2020) 
Based on the light novel series by Satoru Yamaguchi
        

  Number of Episodes   24&#43;1 OVA    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
My Next Life as a Villainess follows a young woman named Catarina Claes who lived a mundane life until an accident reawakens memories of her past life.

Realizing that she&#39;s destined for failure, Catarina does everything she can to subvert the system and forge her own path. A trope-filled shojo series that&#39;s as soft as it is safe, My Next Life As A Villainess works firmly within genre boundaries, but those who enjoy a simple and sweet isekai offering likely won&#39;t want to turn this down.

 13  Reborn as a Vending Machine: I Now Wander the Dungeon (2023) 
Based on the light novel written by Hirukuma
        

  Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
If fans thought being reincarnated as a slime was wild, try a hero who gets reincarnated as a vending machine. Reborn as a Vending Machine is exactly what it says on the tin, as the protagonist Boxxo is indeed reincarnated into a fantasy world as a vending machine. However, unlike Slime which gave Rimuru a suitably cool design, Vending Machine is fully committed to making Boxxo a functioning vending machine. More than just a hilarious parody of isekai tropes Reborn as a Vending Machine actually has some clever writing as the series finds increasingly clever ways for Boxxo to use his vending machine powers.

 12  The Devil is a Part-Timer! (2013) 
Based on the light novel written by Satoshi Wagahara
        

  Number of Episodes   37    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
Unlike most Isekai anime, The Devil is a Part-Timer takes a novel approach to the reincarnation trope by transporting a fantasy character into the normal world. Satan is trying to take over the territory of Ente Isla, but, when he is cornered, he escapes through a portal that spits him out in modern-day Japan. Upon arrival, Satan and the followers change into humans and are forced to contend with their new surroundings. To survive, Satan takes on a part-time job at a local fast-food restaurant, MgRonald&#39;s, while also keeping an eye out for old enemies in this strange new world. The series is full of comedy and cleverly subverts viewers&#39; expectations time and again.

Based on the manga by Naoki Yamakawa
        

  Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
I&#39;m Standing on a Million Lives follows a group of middle school students transported to a medieval fantasy world to complete quests, returning once they&#39;re finished only to be summoned again sometime later. Somewhat of a mix between an isekai and a teenage slice-of-life series, I&#39;m Standing on a Million Lives wears many hats. While the plot is ridiculous and the characters - particularly the protagonist - can be tough to take seriously, there&#39;s a hearty dose of humor in this isekai adventure, and characters like the Game Master introduce enough intrigue to keep viewers engaged throughout the season.

Many protagonists in isekai anime become overpowered shortly after being reincarnated, but this is not the case in Grimgar Of Fantasy And Ash. This anime is set in an RPG-like world where a group of amnesiac strangers is forced to work together to survive. The setting of the anime is brutal and realistic, and the characters face genuine challenges that could easily kill them. Even low-level goblins are no easy task for the group of adventurers, which makes their journey all the more gritty and realistic.

 9  Log Horizon (2014) 
Based on the light novel by Mamare Touno
        

  Number of Episodes   62    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation

Together, Shiroe and his companions navigate the game&#39;s adventures and learn how to coexist with the game&#39;s NPCs known as &#34;natives.&#34; Log Horizon doesn&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel or do anything new in the genre, but it&#39;s a solid series that sticks to a tried and true formula. It&#39;s a classic adventure story that checks off all the boxes when it comes to swords, sorcery, and fantasy drama making it a great anime for fans of That Time I Got Reincarnated a Slime to get lost in.

 8  .hack//Sign (2002) 
Original anime series created by Studio Bee Train
        

  Number of Episodes   26&#43;3 OVAs    Where to Stream   Funimation, Tubi    
Though far from the first isekai anime, .hack//Sign codified many of the tropes that have since become foundational to the genre. Things like getting stuck in a video game fantasy world can trace its popularity, in some part, back to .hack. The series follows a young man named Tsukasa whose mind is trapped in The World, the first MMORPG developed in the wake of a disaster that destroyed the internet. What follows is as much of a mystery series as it is a fantasy, as Tsukasa tries to unveil the reason his mind is stuck in The World. Even beyond its interesting themes and intriguing plot, as a forefather of isekai, it&#39;s well worth a watch for That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime fans.

Based on the light novel written by Tappei Nagatsuki &amp; illustrated by Shinichirou Otsuka


 







  Number of Episodes   50&#43;2 OVAs    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
Unlike most isekai protagonists, Natsuki Subaru of RE: Zero - Starting Life In Another World is not transported into a new world by a video game or after getting hit by a truck. Unfortunately for Natsuki, he is teleported completely at random—and, worse still, he has no special powers in this new world. He quickly befriends a half-elf named Satella and her companion, Puck, agreeing to help them recover a stolen insignia. When they are abruptly killed, Satoru wakes up in his bed and quickly realizes that every time he dies, he is granted a new life and an opportunity to save himself and his friends. The series is part Groundhog Day and part dark fantasy, and it offers a refreshing twist to the reincarnation trope that will certainly appeal to fans of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.

However, rather than being kicked from the game, Momonga finds himself trapped inside Yggdrasil in the form of his skeleton &#34;Overlord&#34; character. Assuming the name of his former guild in the game, Ainz Ooal Gown, he sets about expanding his domain and vanquishing the various monsters and factions that stand in his way.

So I&#39;m A Spider, So What? leans into all of the best tropes of isekai and actively tries to break the fourth wall as much as possible. The protagonist is a high school girl who was killed in an explosion and reincarnated as a low-level spider monster at the bottom of a dungeon that&#39;s filled with dangerous creatures in a fantasy world.

Millions log into its virtual world, but a twist is revealed when the game&#39;s creator seals every player inside, holding them hostage until someone can conquer all 100 of the game&#39;s levels. The stakes are high, as in-game termination results in real-world death, and it&#39;s up to a powerful player named Kirito to assemble a party of heroes and save the day. Though trope-filled and overly-silly at times, Sword Art Online is one of the most important anime series of the past decade. Sword Art Online is right up there with That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime as one of the most influential isekai series ever, meaning fans owe it to themselves to give at least the first season a watch.
