## Literature Review

Screen Rant sat down with the director of the new Jazz-themed anime movie, Blue Giant, to learn about the process of making a music-oriented film.




The anime film Blue Giant follows the music careers of three young musicians with a shared love of jazz: saxophonist Dai Miyamoto, pianist Yukinori Sawabe, and their fresh-faced drummer, Shunji Tamada. With Dai setting out to be the greatest jazz musician on the planet, the young men face a difficult road to make a name for themselves as a band, JASS. The film is as much about friendship and camaraderie as it is music, and tells the tale of how these three friends push each other to become ever greater as musicians. The film was released in Japan in February 2023, and is set for release in the US




Based on a manga by Shinichi Ishizuka which ran from 2013 to 2016, the film version of Blue Giant brings the music to life in incredible ways, with impressive performances by real jazz artists that are accompanied by some spectacular visuals. Screen Rant sat down with Yuzuru Tachikawa, the director of the film, to find out how one goes about making a film that&#39;s all about music, the challenges of animating musical instruments, and more.


 Director Yuzuru Tachikawa on Bringing Blue Giant to Life 
          

Screen Rant: It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Tachikawa. I had the pleasure of watching the movie Blue Giant earlier today. And as a saxophone player myself and a big anime fan, it&#39;s something I never knew that I wanted. So I was curious, how did you come to work on Blue Giant? And did you have much of an interest in jazz prior to this project?





Tachikawa: So I came upon Blue Giant when a producer from Toho handed me the original manga and said, ‘hey, we want to make this into a film.’ I read the manga and I personally thought it would be better as a TV series. The producer told me that they were very specific about having this in the theater because they wanted the audience to experience as close to a live jazz concert as possible in a full theater surround sound system.


Screen Rant: That&#39;s interesting, I could definitely see that in the film. While all movies have soundtracks, it&#39;s pretty rare to see music play such a central role in the making of a film. So what was it like directing a film that&#39;s so focused on the music?


Tachikawa: So not only was I director of this film, but I was also the director when we were recording, when we were recording this live. So that was definitely a different experience for me as a director. And I myself, I played a little bit of piano as a child. So when it comes to drums, saxophone, I&#39;m a complete amateur. So those were definitely new experiences of directing for me.





Screen Rant: Watching the film, I was impressed with the animation for playing the instruments. I know that could be very difficult due to the precision involved in capturing that accurately. So how did you go about dealing with that problem?


Tachikawa: I made the animation in three different ways. One, as I briefly mentioned, was that we took video recording of the musicians playing and then animating off that, which was more of a rotoscope approach. The second approach was to have a musician learn the music and mo-capping them. And then the third was your traditional hand drawn. So that&#39;s how those were the approaches that we took to be able to get that performance in anime.


Screen Rant: I know it&#39;s also during those performances when the band is playing that the visuals can get quite surreal. How did you go about creating these visuals that match the feel of the music so well?


Tachikawa: So when I was doing my own research and listening to jazz, that was basically the image that formed in my mind. So that&#39;s what I was trying to get out of my head and put into the movie. Especially because there are so many live performances in the film, I definitely didn&#39;t want to bore the audience just with so many performances. So really focusing and honing in on the musicians&#39; expressions as they&#39;re playing was also very important.





Screen Rant: Another thing I noticed both in those surreal scenes and outside of that is that there&#39;s a bit of a theme of playing with the light and matching the light with the music. Seeing the reflections in the ice cubes, for example. Can you talk a little bit about how you wanted to use light in this film to enhance the music?


Tachikawa: The theme of the film is about the three musicians. But we were also very conscious of Dai being kind of the North Star, the brightest star among the three of them. So we were very conscious about how Dai then affects Yukinari and Tamada as well. And since a lot of those scenes are in... are in like stages where there&#39;s lights and stuff. We were, just very definitely from the beginning, we were conscious about using those different lights that are at those concert venues to better express the music and the concert.


Screen Rant: I guess my last question would just be, is there anything that you would like to say to the people who might be watching this and experiencing jazz for the first time from the movie?





Tachikawa: Yeah, actually there are in fact a lot of people around me who don&#39;t have a huge appreciation for jazz, but they saw Blue Giant. For example, a middle school kid, he decided that he wanted to take up the saxophone or this other kid decided to take drum lessons. Even myself, I took saxophone lessons, and I was able to experience the joy of performing. I&#39;m hoping that this movie would also just inspire people who have lost their way or lost their dream or given up on it to watch this movie and maybe be able to pick themselves up and find their North Star, their dream again.


Screen Rant: It definitely made me want to pick my saxophone up again, so that&#39;s already happening.
