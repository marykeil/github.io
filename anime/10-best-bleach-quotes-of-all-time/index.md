## Literature Review

As one of the big three anime in the early 2000s, Bleach has accumulated many inspiring and powerful quotes throughout its run.




Bleach&#39;s dramatic return to the world of anime has many fans reminiscing about the original series, remembering their favorite characters as they get ready to finally see the end of Bleach animated. One of the things that fans often turn to Bleach for are quotes from these iconic characters, especially those that help to sum up a character&#39;s whole worldview in a single line.




The final arc of the anime’s main storyline is bound to contain more amazing quotes to uplift its audience, but there are plenty of classic lines straight from the original series as well. Words said within the heat of battle can leave a lasting impact on the show&#39;s characters and viewers alike, but which stuck with the audience most throughout the series?


 &#34;It&#39;s Easier To Crush A Dream Than Realize One.&#34; 
-- Gin Ichimaru, former Captain of Squad 3
          

Known for being one of the most mysterious and intricate villains in the anime, Gin is someone who is highly aware of how easy it is to ruin someone&#39;s dreams, and not just because he has crushed many of them himself. The only person’s dream he seemed to care about was the good-hearted Rangiku Matsumoto, since she and Gin grew up together in poverty. The tragedies of his backstory lead him to become a cold man, venturing down a long and dark path in life for the sake of revenge--though he isn’t entirely evil.






 &#34;It’s Meaningless To Just Live... To Just Fight. I Want To Win.&#34; 
-- Ichigo Kurosaki
          

Those who know Ichigo well are aware of just how motivated and determined he is when it comes to fulfilling a higher purpose, his headstrong way of thinking is sometimes stubborn to the point of becoming a fault. However, fight scenes highlighting his unwillingness to yield against even the most powerful Bleach villains are a part of several of the best episodes of the series. Ichigo doesn’t fight just to prove his incredible skill with the blade, but to push himself forward into accomplishing the goal at hand, which is often to protect others.



 &#34;Change Is Inevitable. Instead Of Resisting It, You’re Better Served Simply Going With The Flow.&#34; 
-- Shunsui Kyoraku, Captain of Squad 2
          




Shunsui Kyōraku gives his two cents about living life properly by embracing the unpredictable changes that arise instead of fighting hopelessly to keep things as they once were, no matter the circumstances. Often found on the sidelines of most episodes, Shunsui makes up for his lack of screen time with subtle yet inspiring quotes like this one, making sure no one forgets that he’s there. The wisdom he possesses mixed with the relaxed way he carries himself proves that he truly practices what he preaches.



 &#34;Revenge is just the path you took to escape your suffering.” 
-- Ichigo Kurosaki
          

A fairly consistent theme with the best antagonists in Bleach that Ichigo and friends go head-to-head with is that several of them are acting out a way of revenge, whether it be due to a past trauma or a disagreement in ideals. Ichigo has always had a way of getting into his foe&#39;s head with the strength of his words and his drive, and this quote showcases that trait exceedingly well. On top of the mind games, Ichigo often attempts to reason with his enemies and morally steer them in the right direction, though most of them already have their minds made up.






 “Arrogance destroys the footholds of victory.” 
-- Byakuya Kuchiki, Captain of Squad 6
          

Rukia’s brother has a way with his words, striking them into the pride of everyone he comes across. Byakuya speaks his mind without the need for a filter, declaring that an arrogant mind leads to a sullied triumph. Regardless of winning or losing, if someone is wrong, they haven’t really won, because their point cannot be proven simply by defeating those who are right. To be victorious merely for the sake of a selfish personal gain that damages the righteous is a flawed way of thinking, even if those who come out on top are too stubborn to admit it.



 “A man who raises his hands on a woman is trash. If I become trash… It’ll be just like dying.” 
-- Renji Abarai, Lieutenant of Squad 6
         




Renji Abarai has always been one of the most respectable and best characters in Bleach, proving yet again that his morals are just as strong as he is. Rukia is as lucky to have men like him and Ichigo by her side as they are to have her. To say that he essentially would rather die than strike at a woman highlights the kind of man he is. Ever the protector, Renji has gone to great lengths to keep those he cares about safe from harm. Despite his chaotic and rough exterior, he has a soft heart that strives to be as loyal as it is benevolent.



 “Don’t break anyone’s heart, they only have one. Break their bones, they have 206.” 
-- Ichigo Kurosaki
         

As much of a jokester as Ichigo is, underneath it all is a sensitive heart, even if the quote came across as just another one of his sly remarks. Being an older brother with a deceased mom has certainly taught him how soft a heart can be. Constantly being put down and underestimated when he first became a Shinigami, Ichigo rarely lets it get to him, especially since he has experienced worse things that forced him to steel himself from an early age. His empathetic nature is seen throughout the anime, especially towards his younger siblings.






 “Even if no one believes in you, stick out your chest and scream your defiance!” 
-- Rukia Kuchiki, Lieutenant of Squad 13
         

One of the most popular characters in Bleach, Rukia Kuchiki is a force to be reckoned with, whether it is in a battle of swords or words. She infatuates others with her stubborn yet thoughtful nature, overflowing with resolve each time she speaks. Rukia was always pushing Ichigo to do his best and fight for what he believes in since the day they met. In fact, if not for her giving and highly supportive actions, Ichigo never would have become the master Shinigami that he is today. She would never fully credit herself with this (unless as a teasing remark), but Ichigo himself knows the importance of her proud attitude.



 “If you give me wings, I will soar for you, even if this whole land sinks down to the water.” 
-- Ichigo Kurosaki
          




Even if the situation seems hopeless, Ichigo is a protagonist that will continue to fight for those who have lent him their strength or a shoulder to lean on, especially when it comes to Rukia, Orihime, and others he is close with. Ichigo will summon the strength to shatter fate that doesn’t fall in the favor of the innocent, which he demonstrates in arcs like Mala Suerte!, AKA the twenty-third volume of the Bleach manga series. From the first day he wielded his blade until becoming one of the strongest Shinigami in Bleach, Ichigo has lived and fought to uphold this belief.



 “Do not live bowing down. You must die standing up.” 
--Genryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, Head Captain of Squad 1
          

Genryusai Yamamoto, the elderly commander of the whole Gotei 13, fought for long enough to know that backing down is out of the question for him and the Shinigami under his dictation. He is absurdly powerful, even while having only one arm when he dueled a main antagonist who was actively stealing his power and using it against him, Yamamoto battled to the death with all the might he had left. To live in submission is to have no honor, validating this until his very last breath.
