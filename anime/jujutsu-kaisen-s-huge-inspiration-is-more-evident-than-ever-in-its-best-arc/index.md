## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen has always been a popular and well-regarded manga, but it&#39;s more evident now than ever in the Shibuya Incident Arc. 




Gege Akutami, the creator of the wildly popular Jujutsu Kaisen, has many authors he looks up to. The anonymous author has said that he is a huge fan of Tite Kubo&#39;s Bleach, sneaking into his brother&#39;s room to read them when he was younger. The two series have a lot in common, but Yoshihiro Togashi was revered by Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s author, and it&#39;s more obvious than ever in the Shibuya Incident arc.




It&#39;s no secret that manga authors are inspired by other manga series they grew up watching. Series like Dragon Ball and Naruto have inspired the next generation of mangaka, particularly Yuki Tabata who made Black Clover took up the pen due to Akira Toriyama&#39;s influence. More and more manga are being released than ever, and all the authors have been inspired by those who came before them.

 Gege Has Always Loved Hunter X Hunter 
Jujutsu Kaisen was created by Studio MAPPA, based on Gege Akutami&#39;s original manga.
          

Gege has always taken the opportunity to show his love for Yoshihiro Togashi&#39;s works, specifically YuYu Hakusho and Hunter X Hunter. Manga authors usually supervise the anime adaptations, and Gege has been working closely with MAPPA to make Jujutsu Kaisen better. The Shibuya Incident arc has given him avenues to show his appreciation for Hunter X Hunter, and he did. There is a striking resemblance between Killua and young Gojo Satoru, from the character design to their style of walking. The voice actors for the two characters are also the same.




The Hunter X Hunter anime is widely remembered for its use of narration. Jujutsu Kaisen has never incorporated that element before the Shibuya Incident arc. Although the narration isn&#39;t nearly as good as what&#39;s seen in Hunter X Hunter, it&#39;s refreshing to see that the staff are experimenting and switching it up. From Awasaka looking very similar to Netero to the basis of cursed energy and nen being very similar, Gege Akutami&#39;s love for Togashi&#39;s works has always been obvious â€“ but reaches new heights i the infamous story arc.

         

This love isn&#39;t one-sided, either. Togashi loves Jujutsu Kaisen, and one of his chapters draws inspiration from it. The two creators respect each other and their works, and the two fan-favorite series inspiring each other will definitely make both manga that much better. The Shibuya Incident arc is approaching its climax, and its inspiration from Hunter X Hunter only serves to make the anime an even better experience for fans.
