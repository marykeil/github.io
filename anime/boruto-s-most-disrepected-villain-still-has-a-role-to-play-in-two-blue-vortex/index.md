# Boruto s Most Disrepected Villain Still Has A Role To Play In Two Blue Vortex


## SUMMARY 



  Code proves himself to still be a serious threat in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex by defeating Sasuke and displaying his true power.   Despite being ridiculed, Code has the potential to become an Otsutsuki god and poses a significant disruptive force.   Code&#39;s abilities have been underestimated, and he is likely to continue playing a major role in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.

## Literature Review

While it&#39;s commonly believed that Code is nothing more than a “filler villain”, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex shows he is still a threat to deal with.




Warning: SPOILERS for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #5




A longstanding object of ridicule and derision, Boruto&#39;s Code seemed set to become the series&#39; permanent laughingstock and disappointing villain. As it turns out, he remains a potential danger to Konoha and the heroes, as he proved when he defeated the mighty Sasuke Uchiha.

From the very beginning, life has been hard for Code. Engineered to be the vessel for Isshiki Otsutsuki - a role he was happy and honored to fill - Code was passed over for the position when it was discovered that the white Kama imprinted on Code&#39;s hand was not compatible with Isshiki&#39;s soul force, meaning he had to leave his spot to the hated Kawaki.

          

Deemed next to worthless by Jigen - Isshiki&#39;s vessel at the time - Code was ignored by higher members of Kara&#39;s Inner group. After surviving Kara&#39;s purge, and becoming its leader, Code still failed to impress, especially after he freed the much-more-powerful Eida and Daemon. His most embarrassing moment came in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter #4. There, Matsuri - the female member of the new self-aware God Trees, the &#34;Shinju&#34; - called Code a &#34;clown&#34; whose &#34;fate&#34; is to be someone else&#39;s tool.





 Code&#39;s Abilities Have Never Been An Issue 
          

However, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter #5 reminded everyone that Code is not someone to be trifled with. This disclosure comes during Boruto&#39;s flashback, where he recalls Sasuke&#39;s terrible fate. At some point during the past three years, Sasuke and Boruto were fighting Code and his Claw Grime army. But the Code who showed up to that fight, was clearly not the clown Matsuri and others believe him to be. Indeed, he took on two of the greatest shinobi of their respective generations, and won. After Amado unlocked Code&#39;s true power, he became one of the stronger characters in the series, but, unfortunately, his abilities did not much up with his lacklustre portrayal in the story.

Sasuke certainly did not see Code as a pushover or minor threat. Even after seriously injuring him, Sasuke still believed Code to be a serious enough threat that he ordered Boruto to retreat. This was no casual observation by some minor character - this was coming from one of the most skilled and experienced shinobi in the history of the Five Hidden Ninja Villages. On the other hand, Boruto was so concerned about Sasuke taking on Code alone that he did not want to leave. Boruto had crossed swords with Code in the past - if he truly believed Code was not a threat to his master, he would not have been so concerned.






 Code Has Major Disruptive Force Potential 

 

Despite attracting so much mockery, Code has nevertheless made the most impact yet in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex. He is responsible for creating the Claw Grimes that later evolved into the Shinju, even if they are now out of his control. Indeed, even Isshiki recognized that Code had the potential to become an Otsutsuki god. While Code&#39;s personality has always been quirky, and decision-making questionable, he has historically been a very powerful character, whose abilities have only gotten stronger as he has matured. While this may not have been adequately reflected in the manga, it is safe to assume that Code will continue to play a major disruptive part in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.
