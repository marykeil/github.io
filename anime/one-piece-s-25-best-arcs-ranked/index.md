## Literature Review

One Piece is one of the most iconic, beloved, and long-running anime and manga ever. In all of its history, what are the best arcs in the story?




One Piece is one of the most popular manga and anime series of all time, with many classic arcs that rank as some of the best in shonen storytelling. But how do these arcs compare with each other? It&#39;s a question that&#39;s difficult to answer due in large part to how consistent One Piece is. While arcs may vary in tone, length, and theme, most of them share the same level of quality.
With so much story to cover, it&#39;s almost assured that no two fans&#39; list of best arcs will be exactly the same as another&#39;s. One Piece can range from heartbreaking to uplifting to outright horrific. Given this, there are so many ways to judge the strength of any given arc. Despite all this, One Piece&#39;s highest-ranked arcs are so strong because of how they succeed at their goals.









 








 25  Long Ring Long Land Gets More Hate Than Deserved 
Chapters 303 - 321 and Episodes 207 - 219
        

Long Ring Long Land is one of the more controversial arcs in One Piece, being sandwiched between two of the best arcs in One Piece, but it still deserves mention. The arc is one of the goofier in the series, with the Straw Hats engaging in a silly contest against a weak crew of pirates, which has led some fans to view it purely as filler. But this attitude ignores how the lighthearted parts of One Piece are some of what makes the story so unique and fun. In addition, the introduction of the incredibly strong Admiral Kuzan is an important moment that single-handedly justifies this arc&#39;s inclusion among One Piece&#39;s best.





 24  Little Garden Doesn&#39;t Feel As Gigantic Narratively 
Chapters 115 - 129 and Episodes 70 - 77
        

Little Garden may be lower on in ranking of One Piece&#39;s best arcs than many fans may expect. The arc is a lot of fun and introduces Giants to One Piece&#39;s world, which would go on to be a major part of both Usopp&#39;s character arc and the future story as a whole once the Straw Hats reach the island of Elbaf in the coming arcs. However, besides introducing Dorry and Brogy and featuring a fun fight with Baroque Works, the arc isn&#39;t as impactful as many of One Piece&#39;s other best arcs, earning Little Garden a low rank.
Little Garden teases one of the series&#39; final islands and is a major hint towards One Piece&#39;s several tragic genocides. 






 23  Jaya&#39;s Greatness Comes From What It Foreshadows 
Chapters 218 - 236 and Episodes 144 - 152
        

Jaya is largely a setup arc for the incredible events to come in Skypiea, but it still has a lot to offer for fans. Luffy and Blackbeard&#39;s first interaction is one of the most iconic scenes in the series and set the tone for their conflicts to come. The arc also first showed some major figures in One Piece&#39;s world like Doflamingo and the Five Elders. Perhaps the most satisfying moment in Jaya though is when Luffy defeats the cocky pirate Bellamy in one of the most cathartic beatdowns in the series.





 22  Orange Town Introduces Fan-Favorites Like Buggy &amp; Shushu The Dog 
Chapters 8 - 21 and Episodes 4 - 8
        

Orange Town is one of the earliest arcs in One Piece, and thus it set the tone for much of what was to come. From the goofy yet menacing villain Buggy the Clown to the shockingly tragic backstory of a dog the crew finds in the village, many of the best elements of One Piece&#39;s later arcs can be found in much rougher forms here. However, the true star of the arc is Nami, who is delightful from her introduction and would later go on to become one of the most important characters in the series.





 21  Baratie Teases Fans With How Big The World Is 
Chapters 42 - 68 and Episodes 19 - 30
        

While this arc may rank near the bottom of One Piece&#39;s best arcs, it is still incredibly important. Baratie introduced Sanji, one of the core members of the Straw Hat Crew. His backstory with Zeff is still one of the most powerful in the series. And while Luffy&#39;s fight with Don Krieg may not be the best in the series, Zoro&#39;s One Piece battle with Mihawk is a major turning point for the character that also gives tantalizing hints of One Piece&#39;s broader world.
The arc establishes how intimidating the Grand Line can be while also teasing a level of strength for One Piece to work towards. 






 20  Drum Island Introduces Chopper&#39;s Cold Past, Then Warms Fan&#39;s Hearts 
Chapters 130 - 154 and Episodes 78 - 91
        

This One Piece arc only ranks above Baratie due to the power of Chopper&#39;s backstory. However, this doesn&#39;t mean the rest of it is bad, as Wapol is a delightfully hateable villain and Luffy taking him down is incredibly cathartic. This arc also includes the first mention of the Will of D., an incredibly important and mysterious concept that will play a larger role as the series continues.
The arc is re-adapted as a dream Chopper had with slight differences in the ninth One Piece film: Episode of Chopper Plus: Bloom in Winter, Miracle Sakura. 






 19  Fishman Island Arc Demonstrates The Straw Hats Growth Post Timeskip 
Chapters 603 - 653 and Episodes 523 - 574
        

Despite its relatively low ranking, the Fishman Island Arc was a rather eventful saga in the series. As the Straw Hats arrive at Fishman Island, chaos ensues when Hody Jones, a fanatic of the pirate Arlong, tries to invade the kingdom and dethrone the royal family. The arc introduces many important lore details that One Piece is still exploring. It also features an impactful storyline that shows the mistreatment the Fishmen get from humans. To add, many viewers were stoked to see Luffy start a fight with the Yonko Big Mom, although they won’t see the Yonko be defeated until the much-hyped Wano Arc.





 18  The Skypiea Arc Continues To Grow In Importance As The Series Expands 
Chapters 237 - 302 and Episodes 153 - 195
        

While the Skypiea Arc may not rank as high as some of the more exciting One Piece arcs on this list, it has only become more relevant as One Piece has gone on. The events of the arc see the Straw Hat members discover the connections of the Sky Island to Jaya and also learn of a lost city full of gold. The arc also uncovers some important news that reveals more about the Poneglyphs, stones that hint at One Piece&#39;s final destination. Because of the exciting narrative and emotional storyline that puts Mont Blanc Noland and the Shandorians front and center, fans watching or reading One Piece for the first time should keep their eyes peeled for the Skypiea Arc.

One Piece is known for drawing influences for its characters from a variety of sources, but the most surprising influence may be an unexpected rapper.








 17  Post-War Arc Shows Luffy At His Lowest And How He Picks Himself Back Up 
Chapters 581 - 597 and Episodes 490 - 516
        

Following one of the most intense arcs of the series is no easy task but One Piece&#39;s Post-War arc does a great job. The arc focused on the aftermath of the Summit War and shows Luffy at his emotional low point. He has a brutal flashback to how he lost his other brother Sabo and realizes how outmatched he is when compared when the threats to come in the New World. The thought of his crew pulls him back from the edge however, and he is able to forge onwards with new resolve as the series entered its first time skip.





 16  Romance Dawn Effectively Establishes A Story That&#39;ll Last The Ages 
Chapters 1 - 7 and Episodes 1 - 3
        

While Romance Dawn may rank below many of the other arcs on this list due to its relative simplicity, it is arguably the most important arc in One Piece. Introducing Luffy, Shanks, Zoro, and some of the basic power structures of the world at large, Romance Dawn is a brilliant beginning to the series. While later arcs may reach higher highs, for some fans Romance Dawn will always be the purest distillation of what makes One Piece great.





 15  Water 7 Arc Breaks Hearts And Builds Fear Of The World Government 
Chapters 322 - 374 and Episodes 227 - 263
        

While One Piece&#39;s Water 7 arc doesn&#39;t rank higher because it mostly features the preparation of the Straw Hats for Enies Lobby, it is still very eventful in its own right. The arc introduces the classic One Piece villains CP9, led by Rob Lucci. It also sees Robin and Usopp briefly leave the Crew, allowing Luffy to step up and be a more headstrong leader in order to keep his crew in order. The arc also introduces a fun new crew member Franky.





 14  Reverie Arc Shows How High Up The World&#39;s Corruption Stems 
Chapters 903 - 908 and Episodes 878 - 889
        

The Reverie Arc is perhaps one of the most important post-Time Skip arcs in One Piece, which is why it ranks above other longer storylines. The arc dives deep into the lore of the Celestial Dragons, or the elites in the society of One Piece. The series further explores the selfish nature of the Celestial Dragons and how they interact with the pirates. The arc also reveals the gathering of the Revolutionary Army commanders, which includes Luffy’s revolutionary father Monkey D. Dragon. The meeting of One Piece&#39;s powerful characters, as well as the discussion of putting a stop to the Shichibukai system, makes the Reverie arc one of the most gripping storylines in the show.
Imu, the secret ruler of the terribly corrupt World Government, makes their debut in the Reverie arc. 






 13  Zou Arc Establishes Vital Alliances That Change The World 
Chapters 802 - 824 and Episodes 751 - 779
        

One Piece&#39;s Zou Arc kicked off the Whole Cake Island Saga with a bang, which is why it ranks so highly. The arc revealed vital information about the Road Poneglphs and foreshadowed important future events in the show. Many fans also felt that the arc was a breath of fresh air and was wholesome, filled with memorable moments such as the introduction (and departure) of Ryunosuke. Of course, it also included the incredibly powerful revelation that Raizo was safe, which still ranks as one of One Piece&#39;s most powerful moments.





 12  Egghead Island Is One Of The Series Most Rewarding Arcs 
Chapter 1058 - Present and Episodes TBD
        

Anime-only One Piece fans beware, this arc hasn&#39;t been adapted yet! While it is still ongoing in the manga, Egghead Island is already one of One Piece&#39;s most important arcs and may even rank higher after it concludes. The Straw Hats all get time to shine on Vegapunk&#39;s futuristic island, but the real reason this arc is so excellent is the broader glimpses of One Piece&#39;s larger world it provides. Major powers are beginning to mobilize and collide, which makes One Piece&#39;s final saga truly feel like the culmination of decades of storytelling.





 11  Sabaody Archipelago Arc Broke The Straw Hat Crew 
Chapters 490 - 513 and Episodes 385 - 405
        

The Sabaody Archipelago Arc is particularly important in the events of One Piece, so it ranks relatively high. It introduces the Celestial Dragons, dangerous antagonists who wield immense political and authoritarian power. It also sets up the Straw Hat crew for One Piece&#39;s big time skip. While there are certainly larger or more entertaining arcs during the course of the series, the Sabaody Archipelago Arc does large amounts of work in setting up future events and characters, while still being gripping and important.





 10  Alabasta Arc Pushed Luffy and His Crew To New Heights 
Chapters 155 - 217 and Episodes 92 - 130
        

Deservedly ranking in the top ten, the Alabasta Arc is one of One Piece&#39;s most iconic storylines, following the Straw Hat Pirates as they attempt to defuse a massive war. The arc pushes all the Straw Hats to their limits as they fight against the warlord Crocodile and his forces. However, the Alabasta arc has a number of other important elements, ranging from expanding the greater lore of One Piece to seeing characters like Robin and Nami play a bigger role.





 9  Thriller Bark Arc Features The Best Straw Hat Teamwork Moments 
Chapters 442 - 489 and Episodes 337 - 381
        

While it may be a controversial arc, Thriller Bark still deserves to rank in One Piece&#39;s top ten. Thriller Bark is particularly well known for its introduction of One Piece&#39;s Straw Hat Brook, a skeleton who becomes the musician of Luffy&#39;s crew. Thriller Bark also has the Straw Hats contend with several Warlords Of The Sea, notably Gecko Moria, further increasing the threat the main characters had to face.
Kuma&#39;s interaction with Zoro at the end of the arc continues to stand as a fan-favorite moment. 






 8  Whole Cake Island Arc Proves That Yonko&#39;s Are A Force Of Nature 
Chapters 825 - 902 and Episodes 783 - 877
        

Whole Cake Island deserves its high ranking as it is the first One Piece arc to truly show how dangerous the Yonko can be. In the arc, Luffy and some of his allies set off to rescue the Straw Hat member Sanji from an arranged marriage. However, they soon become embroiled in a plot to overthrow Big Mom, an incredibly dangerous pirate, and one of the four Emperors of the New World. The Whole Cake Island Arc features one of the oddest settings in One Piece, which is much darker than its appearance would suggest. This arc also introduces a number of new characters, namely Sanji&#39;s greater Power Ranger-esque family and a major One Piece villain, Big Mom.





 7  Impel Down Brings Together Friends And Foes In An Epic Prison Break 
Chapters 525 - 549 and Episodes 422 - 425, 430 - 456
        

Impel Down is an incredibly entertaining One Piece arc that ranks so highly due to its reintroduction of many past villains. The arc follows a tried and true plot trope: the prison break, as Luffy attempt to free his brother Ace from the subaquatic prison, with some massive backup from a gang of villains who are surprisingly heroic. While this arc, in many ways, sets up more bombastic ones further on in One Piece&#39;s story, it is not without its merit. The arc features a number of characters, both new and old, as well as many fights, with Luffy notably locking horns with the pirate Blackbeard.





 6  Arlong Park Features Early One Piece&#39;s Most Satisfying Beatdown 
Chapters 69 - 95 and Episodes 31 - 45


 







Despite being one of One Piece&#39;s earliest arcs, Arlong Park ranks so highly because it is also one of the series&#39; most iconic. Featuring Nami&#39;s devastating One Piece backstory and Luffy&#39;s cathartic defeat of Arlong, the arc was what hooked many fans on the series. With the revelations in Fishman Island, the arc has only gotten better in retrospect, cementing it as one of One Piece&#39;s best.
The first season of Netflix&#39;s Live-Action adaption of One Piece ends after Arlong&#39;s defeat.
