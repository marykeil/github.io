# Hit Lovercraftian Manga Finally Returns From its Big Hiatus


## SUMMARY 



  Ghost Reaper Girl resumes after a year-plus hiatus, with new characters inspired by Lovecraft&#39;s Cthulhu mythos.   The new Cthulhu-inspired characters in chapter #36 of Ghost Reaper Girl only loosely resemble their original counterparts, but some previous characters closely resemble Lovecraft&#39;s creations.   Ghost Reaper Girl introduces Bastet, an Egyptian goddess, and connects her to the Lovecraftian character Nyarlathotep, adding depth to the story&#39;s mythology.

## Literature Review

After more than a year of being on hiatus, the Cthulhu-inspired Ghost Reaper Girl has finally resumed with three new Lovecraftian characters.




Warning: Spoilers for Ghost Reaper Girl chapter #36The Lovecraftian Shonen Jump&#43; manga Ghost Reaper Girl has finally resumed after a year-plus hiatus that was announced officially in late May 2022. The latest installment picks up with a bang right where chapter #35 left off on May 2 with three of four new characters sharing the same names as HP Lovecraft&#39;s Great Old Ones from the Cthulhu mythos.




Before the May announcement, the biweekly Ghost Reaper Girl had already been plagued with hiatuses due to mangaka Akissa Saiké&#39;s poor health. Save for Ghost Reaper Girl&#39;s three-month-long break, Ghost Reaper Girl would usually resume in one month after an additional two-week respite, but by May, it proved to be too much for Saiké.

          

His official announcement in chapter #35.1 read that he couldn&#39;t continue working in this fashion and would resume writing upon the guidance of medical supervision. Luckily for fans, the hit manga is back with more Lovecraft-inspired characters than ever.


 Ghost Reaper Girl Returns With New Lovecraft-Inspired Characters 
          




Ghost Reaper Girl returned on October 30th with the sudden release of chapter #36. In the surprise installment, the eponymous hero, also known by her human name Chloe Love, gets her request granted to meet the directors of the organization that employs her to hunt ghosts, Arkham Bullet. Chloe&#39;s actions are motivated by Arkham&#39;s recent decision to send characters loosely based on Cthulhu monsters after her and her spirit comrades for their association with the spirit Kai Iod. Arkham had branded Kai as a potential threat since he recently succumbed to his alternate ego the Yog of Destruction - which is undoubtedly Ghost Reaper Girl&#39;s version of Lovecraft&#39;s Yog-Sothoth - and the Yog of Destruction can open the gates of Hades himself.

Three of the four directors Chloe and her friends meet in chapter #36 are the Great Old Ones from the Cthulhu mythos, including Ithaqua, Tsathoggua, and Hastur. Much like many of Ghost Reaper Girl characters who are based on Lovecraft&#39;s monsters, these three don&#39;t immediately share any resemblance to their main influences except for having the same name. For example, Ghost Reaper Girl&#39;s Ithaqua is a fair-faced, blonde pretty boy when Lovecraft portrayed the creature as a terrifying giant who only roughly bears the same shape as a human with glowing red eyes.






 Ghost Reaper Girl Ties Lovecraft to Ancient Egypt 
          

Interestingly, the fourth director from chapter #36 is Bastet, an Egyptian goddess who doesn&#39;t appear in Lovecraft&#39;s Cthulhu mythos. This isn&#39;t the first time that Ghost Reaper Girl has featured a creature from someone else other than Lovecraft like the Hounds of Tindalos by author Frank Belknap Long. Although not directly referenced by Lovecraft, Bastet complements another Lovecraftian character in Ghost Reaper Girl - the director Nyarlathotep who sometimes appears as an Egyptian Pharaoh. In Ghost Reaper Girl, her character sometimes manifests as an Egyptian-esque symbol. The fact that Bastet is an Egyptian goddess and Nyarlathotep is greatly influenced by Egyptian lore makes Bastet&#39;s inclusion appropriate.

With new Lovecraft-inspired characters and a thrilling new chapter, fans of Shonen Jump&#43;&#39;s Lovecraftian hit have more than enough reason to be excited. Hopefully, mangaka Akissa Saiké&#39;s health will hold out so that readers can find out what characteristics of these three new Great Old Ones actually correspond with Lovecraft&#39;s original creations in a future chapter of Ghost Reaper Girl.
