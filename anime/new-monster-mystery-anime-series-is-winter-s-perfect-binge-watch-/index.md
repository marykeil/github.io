Don&#39;t get caught up in the epic but misleading first episode because Undead Murder Farce&#39;s monster-themed Sherlock Holmes episodes are addicting.


Summary

  Undead Murder Farce is a detective anime that uses brilliant deduction skills to solve crimes involving well-known monsters.   The first episode doesn&#39;t hint at the true plot, which involves the protagonists starting their own private detective agency.   Each murder in the series incorporates the unique abilities of monsters, adding an extra layer of intrigue and giving a new spin to popular creatures.  







Undead Murder Farce is an adaptation of the novel series Undead Girl Murder Farce by Yugo Aosaki.







With Crunchyroll&#39;s Fall 2023 lineup still simulcasting weekly, and the Winter 2024 not starting until January, there&#39;s a new detective series that fans can quickly binge during the wait time titled Undead Murder Farce. A Sherlock Holmes-style anime with monsters, Undead Murder Farce&#39;s utilizes brilliant deduction skills from its protagonist to deconstruct well-known monster abilities in various crimes.

First-time viewers will hopefully go in already aware of tje main premise and not rely completely on its intriguing name, Undead Murder Farce, which is shorter than the original series of novels by Yugo Aosaki, Undead Girl Murder Farce. Those who inevitably get captivated by the first episode may be thrown for a loop when the second episode begins, for there is absolutely nothing in the series&#39; debut that suggests the two main monsters, Aya Rindo and Tsugaru Shinuchi, are starting their own private detective business. However, once the mysteries begin, it&#39;s hard to stop watching.

Of course, anything is possible by the end of the first episode, even the outlandish possibility of Aya and Tsugaru starting a private detective agency. When the morbid backgrounds of both protagonists align, their shared goal sends them on a mission to find and kill a mysterious, but easily identifiable villain who doomed both of them. As a result, Aya and Tsugaru&#39;s journey has the potential to take any shape or form, opening the series to an array of exciting possibilities. However, detective series are a very niche genre in anime, so the sudden switch could turn some viewers away.

While the end of the first multi-episode murder mystery may not justify the sudden genre switch for some, it does explain why the two protagonists become detectives. When the first case is solved, Aya and Tsugaru leverage the sway they obtained from their monster clients to point them in the direction of their main target. Of course, by the time the murderer has been apprehended, the series becomes irreversibly engaging. The first case is a twist on the classic murder mystery case, wherein a small group of people within the same house are the only possible culprits, eliminating the usually overly extended and uneventful search phase of the case and going straight to the part where all the exciting deductions are made. And, as an obvious spin on famous Sherlock Holmes stories – with one of the suspects making the big connection aloud – the resulting deductions are brilliant and fun.




          

The fact that the murders in Undead Murder Farce incorporate each monster&#39;s unique and well-known abilities adds an extra layer to the series&#39; intrigue. This gives Undead Murder Farce a unique opportunity to view the best aspects of popular creatures or famous literary figures everyone enjoys under the intense magnifying glass of deduction theory, which in turn presents them in new and exciting ways and, more importantly, in the beloved style of Sherlock Holmes.
