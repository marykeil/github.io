## Literature Review

Netflix recently debuted a new trailer for their much-anticipated Scott Pilgrim anime, and it&#39;s an epic throwback to the 90s Mortal Kombat theme!




A brand-new trailer for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off has the cast going full Mortal Kombat in an epic way. The upcoming adaptation of the hit Scott Pilgrim series has become one of the most anticipated anime to release in 2023. The Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley comics and 2010 film by Edgar Wright have risen in popularity over the years, making this new anime incredibly hyped by fans. With about a month to go till its release, Netflix has released a new trailer, and it&#39;s absolutely perfect.




The newest trailer for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, shared over the weekend on Netflix&#39;s YouTube channel, starts out simply enough. Scott wakes up from a dream as Ramona Flowers passes through, telling his roommate Wallace about her. Then, a montage of what&#39;s to come begins with Scott meeting Ramona and asking her on a date. Once he realizes he has to defeat her seven evil exes to date her though, the rest of the trailer goes off with an epic homage to the incredibly catchy Mortal Kombat theme from the 90s. It&#39;s a perfect way to get fans hyped for what&#39;s to come as it blends smoothly with the epic fights to come in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.


 Scott Pilgrim&#39;s New Trailer Is The Perfect Homage To Mortal Kombat 

 

The best thing about this trailer is undoubtedly how much it respects the Mortal Kombat theme. Not only does it feature the epic notes that made fans want to punch the air because of how adrenaline-fueled it is, but it also includes the narrator reading off the various Scott Pilgrim characters in the same style as the original theme naming the different fighters in the film. It&#39;s a perfect way to display the massive voice cast that reunites the 2010 Scott Pilgrim film&#39;s actors while also being a loving wink to those who have fond memories of the Paul W.S. Anderson 90s action film.




What&#39;s notable about the inclusion of the 90s Mortal Kombat theme is that it accompanies a long line of reasons why this will be the essential on-screen version of Scott Pilgrim&#39;s story. Video game references and humor have been a part of O&#39;Malley&#39;s comic since the first volume hit bookstores. The 2010 film doubled down on this by including 1-Ups, health bars and stats to mimic Beat-Em Up games that were arcade treasures. The film even managed to get a beloved video game adaptation that perfectly recreated what Wright wanted the film to be. Incorporating a video game movie theme into this trailer makes it feel like a part of this ever-expanding multimedia universe, and it will undoubtedly have fans excited for when the anime officially debuts on Netflix.
