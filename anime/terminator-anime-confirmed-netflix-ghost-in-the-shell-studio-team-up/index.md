## Literature Review

During Netflix&#39;s Geeked Week event, a teaser and release date were revealed for the upcoming Terminator anime produced by Production I.G.




The Terminator anime has just been confirmed to air in 2024 on Netflix, alongside an exciting trailer. Netflix&#39;s Geeked Week has featured some huge announcements, with many of them being anime. From the live-action of Yu Yu Hakusho to The Witcher: Sirens Of The Deep, it has been an exciting week for nerds all around the world.




As one of the most successful movie franchises ever, The Terminator was a great pick to turn into an anime. Originally announced back in 2021, there haven&#39;t been many updates on the project, but a short teaser was released ahead of its 2024 premiere.


 

Although this teaser does confirm that the anime is underway and that there has been progress, there wasn&#39;t much that fans could be excited about as there was no first look at the art style, characters, or animation. What is known is the studio behind the new anime; the legendary Production I.G.

                  John Wick Anime Confirmed: Keanu Reeves&#39; Legendary Hitman Gets His Own Anime   One of the most popular movie franchises has just been confirmed to receive an anime series.   





 The Terminator Anime&#39;s Studio is Legendary 
          

Production I.G is the studio in charge of the project and is well-known for its impressive portfolio of anime. They are recognized for their ability to handle various genres and deliver exceptional results. Their specialty lies in sci-fi anime, and they have proven this with their work on Ghost in the Shell - one of the most popular anime movies of all time - and the futuristic Psycho-Pass. Their latest project, Kaijuu No.8, has also been met with high anticipation. Netflix&#39;s decision to bring Production I.G on board has been applauded as a wise move, given the studio&#39;s impeccable track record and its capability to produce outstanding anime content.

The project has garnered some heavy hitters in the entertainment industry to write the anime. Mattson Tomlin, co-writer of The Batman (2022) and its upcoming sequel, as well as Project Power, will be the showrunner and executive producer of the series. According to Tomlin, the series will take inspiration from past Terminator works, but will deviate from the conventional narrative. He emphasized that the show would break conventions, subvert expectations, and have real guts. It is evident that the creators are aiming for a fresh and innovative take on the classic Terminator story, and fans can expect a thrilling and unpredictable ride.




As big as the Terminator franchise is, it has been struggling, most notably in its 2019 movie Terminator: Dark Fate. This anime promises to show the world that Terminator is back once again to dominate and take the world by storm. With a great and interesting plot, Production I.G&#39;s expertise in the genre, and a talented writer taking the helm, Netflix&#39;s Terminator anime will be yet another highly anticipated anime adaptation of a beloved Western franchise that promises to increase the medium&#39;s popularity.
