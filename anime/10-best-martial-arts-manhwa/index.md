## Literature Review

From grounded stories to those defined by their supernatural twists, there are plenty of excellent martial arts manhwa titles for fans to enjoy.




There are quite a few recurring trends in the world of manhwa, with martial arts being a particularly common theme in the medium, sometimes even overlapping with other popular trends such as isekai manhwa. With the options being as varied as they are, selecting the best martial arts manhwa is far from straightforward, but the one clear thing is that manhwa fans are sure to be entertained by these titles.
Some of these titles are entirely grounded, while others employ supernatural or otherwise fantastical elements in their storytelling and fighting styles, but they all rely primarily on hand-to-hand combat when it comes to resolving conflicts. Typically described by fluid choreography and impactful strikes, the action of martial arts manhwa is always dynamic and engaging, making it the highlight of these works. However, action alone is not enough for a title to be counted among the best, as the story, characters, and artwork need to be up to par too.









 








 10  Tower of God (2010) 
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by SIU
        

Despite not being formally invited, as typical Regulars are, Twenty-Fifth Bam enters the mysterious Tower to pursue Rachel, his one and only friend. Though he has no way to anticipate what he is about to encounter therein, the dangers of the Tower mean little to Bam, who would go to any lengths to reunite with Rachel, no matter what obstacles he must overcome along the way.
Although the tone of the combat shifts gradually, with shinsu attacks becoming more common at some point, most of Tower of God&#39;s earlier fighting scenes are defined by engaging hand-to-hand combat, with Bam learning various martial arts from different dojos. This title stands out even beyond the compelling action though, especially thanks to the complexity of its story, which improves significantly over time, along with the artwork.
Tower of God received a fairly successful 13-episode anime adaptation, which is set to return soon.

Additionally, The God of High School features various fighting styles inspired by real-life martial arts, such as taekwondo and karate. While they are undoubtedly realistic and well-researched, these styles are also further boosted by their users&#39; supernatural powers, making them that much more impressive and dynamic. This title&#39;s story may not necessarily be phenomenal, but it still stands out thanks to its compelling artwork and engaging fights.
