  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From grounded stories to those defined by their supernatural twists, there are plenty of excellent martial arts manhwa titles for fans to enjoy.</p>
<p>There are quite a few recurring trends in the world of manhwa, with martial arts being a particularly common theme in the medium, sometimes even overlapping with other popular trends such as isekai manhwa. With the options being as varied as they are, selecting the best martial arts manhwa is far from straightforward, but the one clear thing is that manhwa fans are sure to be entertained by these titles.
Some of these titles are entirely grounded, while others employ supernatural or otherwise fantastical elements in their storytelling and fighting styles, but they all rely primarily on hand-to-hand combat when it comes to resolving conflicts. Typically described by fluid choreography and impactful strikes, the action of martial arts manhwa is always dynamic and engaging, making it the highlight of these works. However, action alone is not enough for a title to be counted among the best, as the story, characters, and artwork need to be up to par too.</p>
<p>10  Tower of God (2010)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by SIU</p>
<p>Despite not being formally invited, as typical Regulars are, Twenty-Fifth Bam enters the mysterious Tower to pursue Rachel, his one and only friend. Though he has no way to anticipate what he is about to encounter therein, the dangers of the Tower mean little to Bam, who would go to any lengths to reunite with Rachel, no matter what obstacles he must overcome along the way.
Although the tone of the combat shifts gradually, with shinsu attacks becoming more common at some point, most of Tower of God&rsquo;s earlier fighting scenes are defined by engaging hand-to-hand combat, with Bam learning various martial arts from different dojos. This title stands out even beyond the compelling action though, especially thanks to the complexity of its story, which improves significantly over time, along with the artwork.
Tower of God received a fairly successful 13-episode anime adaptation, which is set to return soon.</p>

<p>9  The God of High School (2011)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Yong-Je Park</p>
<p>The God of High School revolves around the eponymous tournament, wherein various Korean high school students compete against each other to determine who the ultimate fighter is, with the winner having any wish granted, no matter how unfeasible. Every participant has their motivation for joining the tournament, from Dae-Wi Han&rsquo;s desire to save his hospitalized friend, to Mo-Ri Jin&rsquo;s simple yearning for challenging strong opponents.
Additionally, The God of High School features various fighting styles inspired by real-life martial arts, such as taekwondo and karate. While they are undoubtedly realistic and well-researched, these styles are also further boosted by their users&rsquo; supernatural powers, making them that much more impressive and dynamic. This title&rsquo;s story may not necessarily be phenomenal, but it still stands out thanks to its compelling artwork and engaging fights.
The God of High School received a 13-episode anime adaptation, which, while not perfect, certainly features some excellently animated fight scenes.</p>

<p>8  Viral Hit (2019)
Original Series Written by Tae-Jun Park &amp; Illustrated by Jeong-Hyeon Kim</p>
<p>Ho-Bin Yoo lives a truly miserable life, being constantly bullied and humiliated while at school and having to spend all of his free time working to support his poor family. However, his life suddenly shifts for the better when he decides to fight back against his bullies, a fight that happens to be recorded and streamed, earning him more money than he could have ever expected. Realizing how lucrative this can be, he teams up with cameraman Ji-Hyeok Woo to continue evolving and taking on stronger opponents.
There are plenty of noteworthy attributes about this title, ranging from its well-developed characters to its vibrant and dynamic art, but the absolute highlight has to be Ho-Bin Yoo&rsquo;s growth, as Viral Hit ensures that its protagonist progresses at a natural pace, explaining every technique he learns along the way.
The author behind Viral Hit&rsquo;s story also created Lookism, a manhwa title known for its exploration of discrimination, bullying, and the effects of social media, among others.</p>

<p>7  Return of the Mad Demon (2021)
Based on the Web Novel by Jin-Seong Yu, Written by JP, &amp; Illustrated by Hi Lee</p>
<p>Although Ja-Ha Lee, also known as the titular &ldquo;Mad Demon&rdquo;, has a lofty dream and the potential to achieve his goals, his end comes abruptly when he falls off a cliff, after failing to steal the Jade of Heaven from the Demonic Cult. Much to his delight, however, he finds himself not in the afterlife, but rather returned to the past, seemingly given a new chance at making things right and avoiding his previous mistakes.
While its story is certainly far from special, that is hardly detrimental to the enjoyment of this title. Placing its focus on beautifully drawn, fluid action scenes, Return of the Mad Demon provides an entertaining experience for any fan of blood-pumping martial arts titles, whose protagonist is not only strong and well-written, but also surprisingly humorous.

<p>6  Teenage Mercenary (2020)
Original Series Written by YC &amp; Illustrated by Rakyeon</p>
<p>After losing his family in a tragic plane crash and finding himself stranded in a foreign land at the age of eight, I-Jin Yu had no choice but to become a child mercenary to survive, improving all of his combat-related skills over time. Ten years later, he learns that there is a home for him to return to in Korea, where his younger sister is waiting for him. While I-Jin is certainly used to difficult situations, the trials he is about to face are all completely new to him, given his lack of experience of a normal high school life.
Living up to his years of experience in the field, the protagonist of Teenage Mercenary proves to be an extremely capable fighter, using his skills not only to defend his younger sister from bullies, but also to fight criminals. Of course, the artwork is suitably fluid and engaging, and the characters tend to prove to be more complex than they may seem at a glance.

<p>5  Girls of the Wild&rsquo;s (2011)
Original Series Written by Hun &amp; Illustrated by Hye-Jin Kim</p>
<p>The titular Wild&rsquo;s Private High School has long been known as an elite all-girls school, where some of the world&rsquo;s most powerful martial artists trained and polished their skills. When this institution suddenly decides to allow male applicants, the only one desperate enough to apply is Jae Gu Song, drawn by the promise of a full scholarship. Yet Jae Gu is about to learn that being surrounded by girls is far from an ideal situation, especially when they&rsquo;re all as dangerous as they are beautiful.
From taekwondo to mixed martial arts, every character in Girls of the Wild&rsquo;s specializes in a different fighting style, making their fights that much more engaging. Still, there is more to this title than mere non-stop action, as it seamlessly combines the former with constant comedic scenes, and can even be emotional at times, developing the romance between different characters.</p>

<p>4  Return of the Blossoming Blade (2021)
Based on the Web Novel by Bi-Ga, Written &amp; Illustrated by LICO</p>
<p>Once a great swordsman of the Mount Hua Sect, Cheong-Myeong successfully put an end to the hard-fought battle against the evil Cheon-Ma, Leader of the Demonic Cult, by striking him down against all odds. Unfortunately, he yielded to his wounds soon after, unable to reap the benefits of his efforts. Unexpectedly awakening a hundred years later with his memories and knowledge of his mastered techniques, Cheong-Myeong makes it his goal to restore his declining beloved sect to its former glory.
Return of the Blossoming Blade is a truly outstanding title, featuring a phenomenal art style that distinguishes it from its peers. Despite not being particularly unique, its straightforward story also proves to be extremely enjoyable, seamlessly blending stunning action scenes with exceptional comedy.

<p>3  Nano Machine (2020)
Based on the Novel by Hanjung Worya, Written by Jeol-Mu Hyeon, &amp; Illustrated by Gang-Bul-Goe Geum</p>
<p>Nano Machine adds a sci-fi twist to the classic murim formula, enhancing the world of martial arts through nanotechnology. The story follows Yeo-Woon Cheon, who, despite being born into an influential family, namely the highest-ranked family in the Demonic Cult, is largely overlooked because of his mother&rsquo;s status as a servant. However, he still has the right to become a Minor Priest, a right for which he competes against his half-siblings, most of whom received more formal training than him.
While Nano Machine may not be as popular as some other similar titles, those who have had the pleasure of reading it tend to agree that it is one of the better works of its type. From the well-written, realistic characters, to the story that distinguishes itself thanks to its sci-fi elements, and even the remarkable art that truly brings the action to life, there are plenty of reasons why this title deserves to be on every murim fan&rsquo;s radar.</p>

<p>2  The Breaker (2007)
Original Series Written by Geuk-Jin Jeon &amp; Illustrated by Jin-Hwan Park</p>
<p>Shi-Woon Yi is a weak and cowardly boy who is constantly bullied by his classmates. His fate changes drastically when he accidentally sees Chun-Woo Han, his new English teacher, using martial arts to defend himself. Impressed by his abilities, Shi-Woon immediately requests to become his disciple, which Chun-Woo reluctantly accepts after the boy proves his determination. Yet the Murim world is far more complicated than Shi-Woon could possibly expect.
Often hailed as one of the forefathers of murim manhwa, The Breaker features various forms of martial arts, with Chun-Woo alone having mastered 9 different styles of martial arts. Moreover, its art style has certainly stood the test of time, proving equally delightful even a decade later. As for the story and the characters, they may seem simple in the beginning, but they eventually reveal themselves to be surprisingly intriguing and intricate, making for an excellent experience overall.</p>
<p>1  The Legend of the Northern Blade (2019)
Based on the Novel by U-Gak, Written &amp; Illustrated by Hae-Min</p>
<p>After fighting to keep the world safe for decades, the Northern Heavenly Sect suddenly falls apart when its leader is accused of conspiring with their enemies, the evil Silent Night. Mu-Won Jin, the last descendant of the sect&rsquo;s final leader, remains all alone, with neither a family nor allies by his side, but he eventually changes his fate by escaping to the mountains and training relentlessly, setting out on a quest for revenge.
The Legend of the Northern Blade primarily features a unique form of martial art known as the Gathering of Ten Thousand Shadows, which has been passed down exclusively to the leaders of the Northern Heavenly Sect. As the inheritor of this technique, Mu-Won&rsquo;s fights are all captivating, with both his choreography and strikes being fluid yet precise. From the epic story to the unique art style, everything about this title is simply outstanding, making it one of the best martial arts manhwa out there.
