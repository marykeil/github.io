## Literature Review

Dragon Ball&#39;s Gohan and Pokemon&#39;s Mewtwo have never officially met, but in a new fanart piece they finally share space with a special Digimon guest!




It’s a well-proven fact that Dragon Ball’s Gohan is one of the strongest Z-Fighters of all time, with Pokemon’s Mewtwo similarly being one of the most powerful pocket monsters to have ever been summoned out of a Pokéball. And now, in an inspired piece of crossover fanart, Gohan and Mewtwo’s distinct anime worlds collide head-on, with the added bonus of Digimon’s Agumon tagging along for the ride!




Salva (@salvamakoto) is no stranger to bringing disparate fictional worlds together in unique and imaginative ways that consistently impress their over 140k followers, with their go-to crossover characters usually hailing from the uber-popular manga and anime universe that is Dragon Ball.


 

Having previously created art of Goku and TMNT’s Michelangelo meeting for the first time, the Z-Fighters dressed as the 90s versions of Marvel’s X-Men team, and even Piccolo reenacting Space Jam’s iconic arm-stretch slam dunk scene, Salva&#39;s latest piece continues their streak of bringing fans incredible mash-up that can’t be seen anywhere else.

                  Dragon Ball&#39;s Heroes And Marvel&#39;s X-Men Get The Perfect Crossover Fanart   Dragon Ball and X-Men are franchises that would never normally crossover in comics or manga, but thanks to new fanart, they merge into one epic team!

A set of anime characters who are by far three of the most powerful warriors in their respective circles, Dragon Ball’s Gohan with his Potential Unleashed state, Digimon’s Agumon with his various Digivolutions, and Pokémon’s Mewtwo with his all-powerful psychic abilities have all reached incredible levels of strength in their long tenure as fan-favorite heroes. Having never officially crossed paths before this very moment, the Geek dream of getting an ultimate team-up of these three franchises was always wishful thinking at best, with Salva finally capitalizing on an idea that will hopefully spawn more posts depicting the trio in their element.

Showing a world where Pokémon, Digimon, and Saiyans coexist, Salva expertly captures the spirit of these three iconic series in incredibly accurate detail, making it seem as if Gohan, Mewtwo, and Agumon were part of the same universe from the start. Drawing the still-in-training version of Kid Gohan sitting at the edge of a cliff as the sun sets the horizon ablaze in vibrant orange and yellow hues around him, Salva adds Digimon’s Agumon by his side, also looking out to the scenery before him, with the psychic Mewtwo flying off in the background. However, Agumon should be careful, as Gohan used to survive on dinosaur&#39;s tail during his time training in the wilderness.

Furthermore, this fanart teases an exciting new land where ridiculously overpowered Pokémon/Digimon hybrids could feasibly exist after finding a way to mix Digivolving and evolutions together, creating a new kind of digital pocket monster that would become even stronger when taken care of and trained by a budding Saiyan warrior. It’s fun to imagine what high jinks a young Gohan would get into as a DigiDestined-turned-Pokemon Master, and thanks to Salva (@salvamakoto), seeing Gohan, Mewtwo, and Agumon finally share the same space has become a reality for lovers of all three franchises.
