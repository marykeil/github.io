# Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War Trailer Teases New Battle Scene for Uryu


## SUMMARY 



  Uryu&#39;s new scene in part 3 of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War showcases an anime-original battle against Squad Zero&#39;s Senjumaru Shutara.   Since the scene in which Senjumaru used her Bankai against Uryu in part 2 was not in the manga, it was clear that the story would diverge to explain later scenes.   Uryu&#39;s new fight scene may offer a chance for him to show off his new Schrift ability, The Antithesis, and give more insight into Senjumaru&#39;s Bankai.

Summary

  Uryu&#39;s new scene in part 3 of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War showcases an anime-original battle against Squad Zero&#39;s Senjumaru Shutara.   Since the scene in which Senjumaru used her Bankai against Uryu in part 2 was not in the manga, it was clear that the story would diverge to explain later scenes.   Uryu&#39;s new fight scene may offer a chance for him to show off his new Schrift ability, The Antithesis, and give more insight into Senjumaru&#39;s Bankai.  







A new trailer for Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War part 3 was revealed at Jump Festa this weekend, and some of the included scenes showcase an anime-original battle for Uryu. Uryu&#39;s new scene sees him going up against Squad Zero&#39;s Senjumaru Shutara, who used her never-before-seen Bankai against Uryu in the climactic moments of part 2.

At the end of part 2, Senjumaru used her Bankai against Yhwach&#39;s elite guard (and Uryu), creating pocket dimensions where each would receive a bespoke punishment for their crimes of invading the Soul King&#39;s Palace. This scene itself never occurred in the manga, so it was already clear that the story would have to diverge somewhat to explain later scenes.

          

Uryu in particular, due to his status as a &#34;traitor&#34; to Ichigo and the Soul Society, had much more story ahead, so fans with knowledge of the manga were left wondering how he would manage to escape Senjumaru&#39;s Bankai.





 Uryu&#39;s New Scene May Display His Ultimate Power 

 

Thus, a new fight scene between Uryu and Senjumaru seemed very likely, and the trailer has confirmed this by showing Uryu in the Bankai&#39;s pocket dimension, fighting back in a way that he didn&#39;t get to in part 2. Due to the overwhelming power of Senjumaru&#39;s Bankai, many fans immediately began to speculate as to what Uryu might be able to do in order to escape. In the anime, Uryu hasn&#39;t really had a chance to show off his new Schrift ability, The Antithesis, very much, having basically only used it to free Yhwach from Squad Zero&#39;s trap. This new fight may give Uryu a chance to really show off what The Antithesis can do.

Despite being an important character to this plot as a Quincy, Uryu has somewhat fallen by the wayside so far, with few scenes focused on him, so fans of the character are sure to rejoice at the idea of Uryu being the focus of new scenes. Such a scene might reveal not only more of his power, but could offer a little more insight into Senjumaru&#39;s Bankai as well. Aside from this fight, the trailer also teases the appearance of some long-awaited characters, like Grimmjow, as well as Ichigo and his friends&#39; arrival at the Soul King&#39;s Palace.




Part 3 of Thousand-Year Blood War is said to have quite a few new anime-original scenes like this, so some significant divergence from the manga&#39;s plotline may be in store. Given that the end of Thousand-Year Blood War in the manga was poorly received, this is likely to be a very good thing, especially since the studio has been working with series creator Tite Kubo directly for the added material. The pacing may slow down a bit to incorporate this new content, which would also likely be for the best, as Thousand-Year Blood War&#39;s anime has been moving at an incredible pace. Unfortunately, the trailer didn&#39;t provide a date for Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War&#39;s return, so fans will just have to wait for more information on when this battle will be seen.
