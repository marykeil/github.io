## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #8 is beginning a new arc for the anime, which will likely take Cid to a new part of the world.




After finishing its latest arc in episode #7, The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #8 will introduce the anime&#39;s next storyline. Given how chaotic its great hero Cid is, it is hard to predict where the series will go next, especially now that it is over halfway through its season. However, episode #7 gave some subtle hints as to what Cid and Shadow Garden will be doing in the near future.

It will be simulcast on HIDIVE on November 22 at 11:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12:30 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened In The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #7? 
          




Episode #7 began by showing how dire the credit crisis had gotten for Mitsugoshi and Shadow Garden. Alpha was also still reeling from Shadow&#39;s apparent betrayal. However, that all changed when Beta revealed that the coded message Shadow had given her actually pointed to where the gold gained from the crisis was, allowing Shadow Garden to stabilize their funds and ride out the economic panic. Shadow, upon seeing his money was gone, assumed Gettan was responsible and thus easily defeated him in a fight. This endeared him to Yukime, who officially joined Shadow Garden afterward.



It is unclear exactly what Yukime&#39;s position in Shadow Garden will be.






 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #8 Will Begin A New Arc 
          




With the counterfeit bill plot finished and the Major Corporate Alliance dismantled, the series is primed to begin another exciting arc. It is hard to tell what exactly this arc will entail given there aren&#39;t many pressing plot threads left from the last set of episodes. However, since he thinks that Shadow Garden is mad at him Cid said at the end of episode #7 that he is planning on traveling away from the city for a while. This could expose viewers to a new part of The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s isekai world. In addition, Delta found a mysterious box at the end of episode #7 that could occupy Shadow Garden&#39;s attention during this arc.

Part of what makes The Eminence in Shadow a great isekai is the chaotic way it flows from one story arc to another, constantly keeping fans on their toes. There is probably only one arc left in the season, which means that it will probably be pretty climactic. The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #8 will give fans their first indication of what that closing storyline will actually entail.




Don&#39;t miss The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #8 when it airs on HIDIVE on November 22, 2023.
