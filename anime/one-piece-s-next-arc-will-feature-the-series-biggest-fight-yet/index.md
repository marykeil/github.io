## Literature Review

Even after more than 1000 chapters and some of the best fights, One Piece&#39;s upcoming chapter will feature one of the greatest duel yet.




If there&#39;s one thing One Piece does better than most anime out there, it&#39;s the fights. The sheer scale of their battles is one to behold, making the series one of the best shonen anime and a dream for action fans. From Zoro&#39;s epic clash with King to Luffy&#39;s upset win over Kaido, there&#39;s no shortage of quality fights in the series.




Although the bar is very high when it comes to fights, Eichiiro Oda, the creator of the iconic adventure series, hinted at an even better fight between the two most unexpected characters.


 

It is not known exactly who the fighters will be, but fans are already theorizing. Although there are many choices and characters that fans want to see take each other on, the most popular choice is between Blackbeard and Shanks.

                  &#39;That Island?&#39;: One Piece&#39;s Creator Just Teased A Long-Awaited Adventure For The Straw Hats   One Piece&#39;s creator hinted at the next adventure for the Straw Hat crew during Jump Festa, and it could be the land of the Giants.   


 One Piece&#39;s Most Exciting Fight Coming Soon 
Created by Eichiiro Oda

 




The letter from Eichiro Oda was read aloud to fans and viewers all around the world by the lovely voice actor of Luffy, Mayumi Tanaka during Jump Festa 2024. Before announcing the highly shocking and anticipated One Piece remake, the next adventure for the Straw Hat Pirates was teased, and then the upcoming big fight. Besides hinting at an unexpected matchup, Oda also said that the outcome would also be a surprising one.

Last year, Oda also teased many epic fights, and true enough, 2023 featured some of the most hyped battles in the series. Garp took on the Blackbeard Pirates, Luffy went up against Admiral Borsalino Kizaru, Shanks made a fool out of Kid and Zoro fought the awakened Lucci. Next year, when the Elbaf arc starts, a huge fight will break out. The most anticipated duels are between Akainu and Luffy, Zoro and Mihawk, and Shanks versus Blackbeard, with the final one having the highest probability of finally happening. Of course, Oda might throw a curveball and surprise fans, but for now, speculation points in the aforementioned direction.




          

With Shanks finally gearing up to look for the titular One Piece, he will have to face Blackbeard and the rest of the Emperors to achieve this goal â€“ including Luffy. There is also some tension between the two given the fact that Blackbeard has caused great suffering for Shank&#39;s friend Luffy, and this might be an opportunity to get him back. If the fight turns out to be between the two, Blackbeard might win, given that the author said the outcome will be shocking, and there&#39;s nothing more surprising than Red Hair being taken down. Whatever path Oda decides to take, it will surely be monumental as One Piece approaches its final war.
