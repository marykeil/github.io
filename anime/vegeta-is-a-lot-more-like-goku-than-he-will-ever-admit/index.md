# Vegeta Is A Lot More Like Goku Than He Will Ever Admit


## SUMMARY 



  Vegeta&#39;s rivalry with Goku is fueled by his desire to be separate and superior, but deep down he is more similar to Goku than he realizes.   Vegeta&#39;s training methods, including comparing himself to Goku, have kept him perpetually behind in power.   Both Vegeta and Goku have failed to master the destructive technique Hakai because they have become more compassionate and pure-hearted over time.

## Literature Review

Despite the fact that Vegeta and Goku are famous rivals in Dragon Ball canon, the Saiyan Prince is way more like Kakarot than he would like to admit. 




Vegeta and Goku are two of the most iconic rivals in anime history, and while it’s true that their rivalry has become one of respect, brotherhood, and mutually-assured progression, it’s still a rivalry nonetheless. Vegeta craves his own glory and significance apart from Goku, despite spending much of his time in Dragon Ball canon standing in Goku’s seemingly ever-present shadow. However, as essentially confirmed in Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta’s actually a lot more like Goku than he will ever admit.




The two Saiyan warriors first crossed paths in the earliest days of Dragon Ball Z, back when Vegeta was still evil and wanted to kill all life on Planet Earth. After Vegeta found redemption by aligning himself with the Z-Fighters against Frieza, he started to use Goku as someone he could compare himself to while he trained solo. While this method yielded amazing results - including Vegeta unlocking a state beyond Super Saiyan before Goku - he found that training this way kept him perpetually behind Goku. So, after Vegeta’s existential freak-out in the form of becoming Majin Vegeta during the Majin Buu Saga, he accepted his role as Goku’s training partner. However, Vegeta never lost that edge that makes him crave superiority over Goku, and to be more than just a carbon-copy of his Saiyan rival. Unfortunately, it’s for this reason that Vegeta would assuredly find it upsetting that he is - in fact - very similar to Goku, and in more ways than just their power levels.


 Vegeta &amp; Goku Can’t Master Hakai For The Same Reason 
          




In Dragon Ball Super chapter 76 by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou, Vegeta admits that he failed to perfect Hakai (otherwise known as Destruction) because he couldn’t be the callous, unfeeling, power-hungry man he was at the start of his Dragon Ball career. In using Hakai, one essentially wills something out of existence, destroying every aspect of it entirely. Therefore, one must be unwavering in the mindset of total destruction, especially in terms of whatever person or object they want to destroy. To have that mindset, one has to be pretty callous, and Vegeta found that he’s just not anymore - and Goku discovered something similar a few chapters earlier.

          

In Dragon Ball Super chapter 25, Goku tried to use Hakai against Zamasu, as he figured that was the only way to eliminate this beyond-god-tier villain. However, because Goku is pure of heart, the attack had little effect. While it’s true that Zamasu mounted a number of defenses against anything these Saiyans could have thrown at him (which is why it took Zeno to finally put him down), the line of logic created with Vegeta’s explanation of his shortcoming can be backtracked to Goku’s failure in using Hakai as well. This means that throughout all that time during Dragon Ball Z while Vegeta was watching Goku and trying to attain his level of power, he picked up something from the Saiyan hero that he didn’t mean to: goodness.




Vegeta went from being a literal destroyer of worlds - someone who would kill those closest to him like it was nothing - to a cosmic fighter of evil and protector of the very planet he once threatened. No longer was he this unfeeling agent of evil, but instead - like Goku - is someone who’s relatively pure of heart. While his actions in later DBZ and throughout Dragon Ball Super confirm this alone, there’s no better side-by-side comparison than Goku and Vegeta’s respective failures in utilizing Hakai, as that proved Vegeta is more like Goku than he’ll ever admit.
