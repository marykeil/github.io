## Literature Review

Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans: Urðr-Hunt is getting a standalone release, releasing it from its ties to Bandai-Namco&#39;s online game.




A new anime has been announced for the Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans series, subtitled Urðr-Hunt. To be more precise, Urðr-Hunt is a long-running animation attached to an Iron-Blooded Orphans phone game, Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans G. Its impending closure might be part of the reason Urðr-Hunt is being turned into a standalone series.




News broke via the Iron-Blooded Orphans&#39; official X account, which revealed the Urðr-Hunt anime with a teaser announcement. While Urðr-Hunt incorporates traditional animation, many story sequences use narrative elements common to mobile phone games, like static character art and 3D game assets.


 

A new anime, therefore, would need to fill in the gaps with new animated sequences to make a seamless viewing experience.

The Urðr-Hunt spin-off follows a new cast and focuses on the space colonies surrounding Venus, which is considered a backwater that lost the developmental race that eventually turned Mars into humanity&#39;s second home in Iron-Blooded Orphans. The series garnered a small and devoted fanbase who wanted more of the original 2015 anime; Urðr-Hunt vieweres appreciated that it provided canonical designs for the unused Gundam Frames that were left unseen in the TV anime. While Urðr-Hunt&#39;s story uses mixed media, it is currently divided into 24 &#34;episodes&#34;, before reaching an abrupt ending due to the game&#39;s cancelation.

Urðr-Hunt is currently locked inside the Iron-Blooded Orphans G phone game, which itself is only available in Japanese. In November, its developer, Bandai-Namco, announced that the game would be ending service next year, January 2024. Given the circumstances, it&#39;s logical that the company would try to cut its losses by using the animation and story already created as the foundation of a new work. Hence, the upcoming project sits in an odd situation where it is the anime adaptation of the animated cutscenes for a video game that will be long shut down by the time the new show airs.




                  Gundam Walks Back On Major LGBTQ&#43; Milestone, Bandai Namco Releases Controversial Apology   Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury served as a major milestone for LGBTQ&#43; representation in animation, but the series just walked back on it.   

There are a lot of questions in the air as to how the Urðr-Hunt anime will handle its new existence - whether it will receive a new ending, have its story divided into the same 24-episode structure, and more. The most one can be assured of is that while this is a salvage project, a new anime would require fresh work; there should be no fear that Urðr-Hunt will be a montage of game clips, at least if Bandai-Namco wants to keep its reputation. All fans of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans may benefit from the game&#39;s closure, as a result.

Both seasons of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans are available on Crunchyroll.
