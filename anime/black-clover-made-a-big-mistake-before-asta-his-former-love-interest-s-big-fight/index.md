# Black Clover Made a Big Mistake Before Asta &amp; His Former Love Interest s Big fight


## SUMMARY 



  Asta&#39;s opponent&#39;s magic changed after being attacked, suggesting that Sister Lily&#39;s abilities as a Paladin won&#39;t be her true power.   Fans want to see Sister Lily fight using her authentic magic, not something given to her as a Paladin.   Asta stopped the flow of magic in his opponent, indicating that Sister Lily&#39;s magic is augmented by her Paladin powers.

## Literature Review

Chapter 348 of Black Clover made a disappointing implication about the type of magic that Sister Lily will wield when she fights Asta.




One of Black Clover&#39;s most heartbreaking battles on the horizon is the much-anticipated fight between Asta and his former love interest Sister Lily. Though the battle has a great deal of potential if it happens, one big opportunity the reveal more of Lily&#39;s character during it has already been missed.




In Black Clover chapter 348 by Yuki Tabata, two onlookers of Asta&#39;s fight against the Paladin Yrul realize that Yrul&#39;s magic changed or reverted after Asta apparently slashed the Paladin&#39;s magic instead of Yrul himself. This creates the impression that the magic that the &#34;Paladinized&#34; Sister Lily will wield against Asta won&#39;t be Lily&#39;s true magical power in Black Clover, and that&#39;s a major mistake.


 Lily&#39;s Paladin Abilities Don&#39;t Truly Reflect Her in Black Clover 
          

When the villain Lucius Zogratis used his Soul Manipulation magic to transform Lily into a so-called Paladin, there was speculation that the Spatial Magic she cast on Asta, which transported him to Hino Country, wasn&#39;t her own, and that she received that type of power from Lucius. In a much earlier chapter, Lily used Water Magic, implying that she could only wield that type of magical ability. But then it was revealed that her two Paladin companions only possessed one type of magic, unlike her, which made it easier to assume that Sister Lily was always a dual magic user and that becoming a Paladin didn&#39;t actually affect the original mage&#39;s powers. In other words, Sister Lily would fight Asta using her actual magic and not something given to her.




This is important since Black Clover hasn&#39;t really shown Sister Lily&#39;s true power except that one time long ago when she only cast one spell. Her opponent had been so impressed he mused that Sister Lily had to be a noble. Since it&#39;s unlikely that Sister Lily will resort to violence again once she is restored to her normal self, her battles as a Paladin are the only real opportunity for the series to develop her powers with greater depth.



 Black Clover is Missing a Big Opportunity With Lily&#39;s Powers 
          

Asta&#39;s latest fight against the Paladin Yrul proves that the magic he was using against Asta was some augmented version of his normal powers. As Asta&#39;s two companions note, Yrul&#39;s magic power changed or reverted after Asta attacked Yrul&#39;s magical abilities directly rather than Yrul himself. This creates the impression that Asta stopped the flow of Paladin magic in Yrul, allowing Yrul&#39;s magic to revert to how it was before Lucius Zogratis transformed him into a Paladin like Sister Lily.




All of this hints that Sister Lily&#39;s magic is augmented by her Paladin powers, so her spells aren&#39;t an authentic representation of her true magical abilities in her battle against Asta. Magical abilities and powers are an opportunity to reveal character, so Black Clover implying Lily&#39;s abilities are more from Lucius ruins a chance to develop Lily further. Hopefully, once Asta&#39;s former love interest Sister Lily is restored in Black Clover, she will have to battle once more, allowing readers to see her true undiluted magical powers.
