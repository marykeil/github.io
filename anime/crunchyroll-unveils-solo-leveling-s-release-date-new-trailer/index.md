## Literature Review

Crunchyroll finally reveals the official premiere date for the anime adaptation of the best-selling Solo Leveling, along with a hot new trailer.




Just in time for the new year, Crunchyroll has released the official debut date for the anime adaptation of the hit Korean manhwa Solo Leveling. Fortunately, fans won&#39;t have long to wait to see the adventures of Sung Jinwoo as he tries to level up his strength and abilities in his quest to become the greatest Hunter of all time.




According to a press release from Crunchyroll, the debut of Solo Leveling&#39;s inaugural season is now scheduled for January 6, 2024. Moreover, the premiere will be a global debut, with fans in over 200 territories across the world will have simultaneous access to the series&#39; first episode.


 

The production of the anime brings together A-1 Studios and Crunchyroll - two stalwarts in the anime industry. The series will be broadcast exclusively on Crunchyroll&#39;s streaming service. According to Crunchyroll&#39;s Chief Content Officer Asa Suehira:



Solo Leveling is a groundbreaking series that has captured the imagination of fans globally, and we are thrilled to be part of the journey to bring this extraordinary manhwa to life as an anime. Our collaboration with Aniplex symbolizes our commitment to delivering high-quality, diverse content that resonates with our viewers.







                  Solo Leveling Reveals First Opening Song And Worldwide Premieres&#39; Dates   The first opening of the highly anticipated Solo Leveling has been revealed, and it&#39;s a collaboration between top Japanese and Korean artists.   


 Solo Leveling Brings The World&#39;s Most Famous Manhwa To Screens Worldwide 
          

The anime series Solo Leveling is adapted from the best-selling Korean web novel written by Chugong, which was later adapted into a webtoon and manhwa in 2018, with illustrations by DUBU. The story revolves around the trials and tribulations of the world&#39;s weakest Hunter, Sung Jinwoo. Hunters are humans who have supernatural abilities that awoke the day that mysterious dungeons appeared on Earth. Sung is frustratingly weak, but one day, after almost dying in a dungeon, he encounters an AI known as the &#34;System&#34; which bestows upon him the ability to level up, which all other Hunters lack.




          

Since its initial webtoon release in 2018, Solo Leveling has been one of the hottest Korean manhwa titles of the last several years. Despite the standard storyline of its hero finding ways to &#34;power up&#34; to defeat ever-stronger foes, fans have been drawn to its iconic action style. Indeed, some have described the way that Solo Leveling&#39;s Jinwoo powers through lower-level opponents getting to the &#34;boss&#34; as not unlike the dazzle and intensity one finds in a single-player video game. Indeed, if action is what a person craves, Solo Leveling is there to provide it. Naturally, the hope is that the anime will be able to replicate that vibe.


 




The Crunchyroll press release also revealed the Japanese and English voice-acting cast for the series: Sung Jinwoo is voiced by Aleks Le, Yoo Jinho is voiced by Justin Briner, Sung Jinah is voiced by Rebecca Wang, and Cha Hae-in is voiced by Michelle Rojas. Initially, Crunchyroll dropped the news of the anime production way back in the summer of 2022. Further details about the anime have been sparse up until this most recent announcement. Sadly, DUBU, the artist of the series passed away shortly after the announcement of the anime in 2022 as the result of complications from a long-term illness.

The series is directed by Shunsuke Nakashige (Sword Art Online). Additional staff credits include music by Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan) and TOMORROW X TOGETHER (K-pop band), character design by Tomoko Sudo, and monster design by Hirotaka Tokuda. With such stellar production values and one of the hottest source materials around, Solo Leveling is poised to be the hottest anime of 2024, but it will have to live up to incredibly high expectations.




Don&#39;t miss Solo Leveling&#39;s premiere when it debuts on January 6, 2024, only on Crunchyroll.
