## Literature Review

One Piece has consistently been releasing movies for over 20 years, and here&#39;s a breakdown of how to watch them in chronological order.





There are few anime with as many films as One Piece.. It should be noted that at the time of writing, most of the films on this list have never been released outside of Japan, so there are no legal means of viewing most of them in the West. However, every One Piece movie from 2007 onward, save for two movies in particular, can either be purchased from various websites or streamed on Crunchyroll and Netflix, so there are at least some films that can be viewed through completely legal means.
 : The Best One Piece Films Released (As of 2022)









 








 17  One Piece: Defeat The Pirate Ganzack! (1998) 
        

The first One Piece movie was the 1998 OVA One Piece: Defeat the Pirate Ganzack!, and as the title implies, it revolved around Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates fighting an anime-original pirate named Ganzack. The movie was made by Production I.G a year before One Piece was picked up by Toei Animation, so in addition to having a different art style, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami all had different voice actors from the anime. In another bit of trivia, the movie was the directorial debut of Goro Taniguchi of Code Geass fame, and decades later, he would return to direct the franchise&#39;s latest film, One Piece Film: Red.





 16  One Piece: The Movie (2000) 
        

The first One Piece film to be made by Toei Animation was released in 2000, and it was appropriately titled One Piece: The Movie. This was nebulously set sometime after Usopp joined the crew, with Sanji only being referenced in the end credits of the film, and its plot revolved around the Straw Hats racing against the pirate Eldoraggo to find the hidden treasure of the legendary Woonan. This was the only One Piece production by Toei Animation to use hand-drawn cel animation, as every other production both before and after the film would use digital techniques.





 15  Clockwork Island Adventure (2001) 
        

The second One Piece film to be produced by Toei Animation was 2001’s Clockwork Island Adventure. The Going Merry is stolen while the Straw Hat Pirates are relaxing on the beach, and when their attempts to find it lead to Nami being kidnapped, the Straw Hats team up with a pair of thieves and travel to Clockwork Island to defeat her kidnappers, the Trump Pirates, and free the inhabitants of the island from their tyranny. Clockwork Island Adventure grossed approximately ¥3 billion at the box office, and before One Piece Film: Strong World, it was the highest-grossing film in the franchise.





 14  Chopper’s Kingdom On The Island Of Strange Animals (2002) 
        

By 2002, Chopper had solidified himself as the franchise’s mascot, and going right along with that, he received his own movie in the same year titled Chopper’s Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals. The movie centers around Chopper being stranded on an island of talking animals who mistakenly believe he was chosen to be their king, and while Chopper initially wanted no part of that, he ultimately steps up to stop Count Battler from stealing the island’s golden horns. This was the first One Piece movie to be explicitly non-canon due to Vivi’s absence, even though she appeared before Chopper and the Baroque Works saga hadn’t ended yet.





 13  One Piece The Movie: Dead End Adventure (2003) 
        

One Piece The Movie: Dead End Adventure was released in 2003, and it was the first film to be a full theatrical film instead of a double feature. The film centered around the Straw Hat Pirates entering the Dead End Race, a pirate boat race with an obscenely large cash prize, but they soon find themselves wrapped up in the conflict between the cheating pirate Gasparde and the bounty hunter trying to kill him, Shuraiya. Interestingly, this and the next movie are the only ones to be referenced in the anime, as Drake, who appeared in both movies, recounted meeting the Straw Hats twice in the G-8 filler arc.





 12  One Piece: The Cursed Holy Sword (2004) 
        

The next One Piece movie to be released was 2004’s One Piece: The Cursed Holy Sword. In the movie, Zoro suddenly betrays the Straw Hat Pirates to work for Saga, his childhood friend who wields the titular cursed holy sword, so Luffy and everyone have to work together to both stop Saga from unleashing the full power of his sword and figure out the reason behind Zoro’s betrayal. Interestingly, One Piece: The Cursed Holy Sword features some of the most graphic animation in all of One Piece with how detailed and brutal Saga’s slaughter of pirates in the opening of the film is.





 11  One Piece: Baron Omatsuri And The Secret Island (2005) 
        

One Piece: Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island was released in 2005, and it’s easily one of the more famous of the bunch. In addition to having a completely different art style thanks to being directed by Mamoru Hosoda of Belle and Digimon Adventure: Our War Game! fame, the story of the Straw Hats going to a mysterious island for a vacation slowly unravels into a horrific tale that serves to deconstruct all of One Piece’s typical conventions. Baron Omatsuri is one of the darkest and most unique stories in the franchise, and it’s still held in high regard by fans and critics alike almost twenty years later.





 10  One Piece: The Giant Mecha Soldier of Karakuri Castle (2006) 
        

The seventh One Piece movie made by Toei Animation was 2006’s One Piece The Movie: The Giant Mechanical Soldier of Karakuri Castle. The Straw Hat Pirates go to Mecha Island, an island filled with robots and other mechanical contraptions, in search of treasure, and doing so puts them in conflict with its tyrannical manchild of a leader, Ratchet. Due to Chopper’s voice actress Ikue Otani being on maternity leave at the time, Karakuri Castle is the only movie to feature Chopper but not Otani, with Chopper instead being voiced by Kazue Ikura, who’s best known for voicing City Hunter’s Kaori Makimura.

 9  One Piece Movie: The Desert Princess And The Pirates: Adventures In Alabasta (2007) 
        

2007 saw the release of One Piece Movie: The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta, and it’s one of the more notable films in the catalog. The film is just a compilation film abridging the Alabasta arc of the story, so it has much less to offer than other films in terms of story. However, Adventures in Alabasta was the first One Piece project to be dubbed by Funimation after 4Kids Entertainment lost the rights to the series, so it was the first chance for Western fans to hear what a more proper dub of the anime would sound like, going forward.





 8  One Piece The Movie: Episode Of Chopper Plus: The Miracle Winter Cherry Blossom (2008) 
        

Toei Animation’s next One Piece movie was 2008’s One Piece The Movie: Episode of Chopper Plus: The Miracle Winter Cherry Blossom. Episode of Chopper was another compilation film, this time chronicling Chopper’s debut, but rather than simply recount the original story, it added a variety of original elements such as giving Wapol a brother named Musshuru and including Robin, Franky, and the Thousand Sunny. In 2014, a special edition of the movie was released to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the anime with new scenes, most notably a new ending that rationalized the changes by making it all a dream Chopper was having.





 7  One Piece: Romance Dawn Story (2008) 
        

The second One Piece film to be released in 2008 was the OVA One Piece: Romance Dawn Story. As the title would imply, the OVA was an adaptation of Romance Dawn, the original pilot story for One Piece, although the story was reworked to take place after the Thriller Bark arc instead of at the beginning of Luffy’s journey, and as such, it featured the entirety of the Straw Hat Pirates. Notably, this is one of only two movies from 2007 onward that can’t be watched or streamed outside of Japan, thus making it unable to be watched through any legal means.





 6  One Piece Film: Strong World (2009) 
        

2009 was the 10th anniversary of the One Piece anime, and in celebration of that, it saw the release of One Piece Film: Strong World. Strong World was the biggest One Piece movie at the time of release, with its plot centered around Luffy and the Straw Hats fighting Shiki, an old rival of Roger’s, as he attempted to carry out a plot to destroy the entire East Blue. One Piece Film: Strong World was also the first of the “modern” movies in that it had Eiichiro Oda involved in the production, personally writing the script. Oda even made Shiki a canon character in the series.





 5  One Piece 3D: Straw Hat Chase (2011) 
        

One Piece Film: Strong World was the end of One Piece having annual releases for its films, and its next film would be 2011’s One Piece 3D: Straw Hat Chase. Straw Hat Chase was a short film about the adventure that unfolds after a bird steals Luffy’s straw hat, and to date, it’s the only One Piece film to be entirely in CGI. The film is also the second film from 2007 onward to not be available on physical or digital media outside of Japan, although in 2021, it was included alongside the Western theatrical release of One Piece Film: Strong World.





 4  One Piece Film: Z (2012) 
        

A year after One Piece 3D: Straw Hat Chase would see the return of full-length theatrical films for the franchise with 2012’s One Piece Film: Z. The titular Z is a former Marine admiral who lost all hope for the world after suffering one tragedy after another, and the Straw Hats end up having to work together to stop him and his Neo Marines from destroying the world. With a box office gross of $85 million, Z is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise, and it also features covers of Nickelback&#39;s “How You Remind Me” and Joan Jett&#39;s “Bad Reputation” by Avril Lavigne at Eiichiro Oda’s personal request.





 3  One Piece Film: Gold (2016) 
        

After One Piece Film: Z, there wouldn’t be another movie until 2016 with the release of One Piece Film: Gold. While partying at a massive casino called the Gran Tesoro, the Straw Hat Pirates are tricked into falling into debt and Zoro is taken as collateral, so the Straw Hats, with help from an old associate of Nami’s, plan out an elaborate heist to both save Zoro and take down the casino’s owner, Gild Tesoro. Gold was the first One Piece film to have a theatrical release in the United States, and at 119 minutes, it currently has the longest runtime of all One Piece films.





 2  One Piece: Stampede (2019) 
        

2019 was the 20th anniversary of the One Piece anime, and that fact was celebrated with the release of One Piece: Stampede. Stampede saw nearly every named character in the franchise be brought together to compete for a lost treasure of Roger’s at the Pirates Festival, but Luffy ends up having to defend his entire generation of pirates from Douglas Bullet, a deadly pirate said to be Roger’s heir aiming to destroy everyone in the world to declare himself the strongest. Stampede is notable for revealing that the final island was meant to be translated as Laugh Tale, not Raftel, four months before that would be confirmed in the manga.

 1  One Piece Film: Red (2022) 
        

The most recent One Piece film to be released was 2022’s One Piece Film: Red in celebration of the franchise’s 25th anniversary. A concert reunited Luffy with his childhood friend Uta, a world-famous diva who also happens to be Shanks’ daughter, but it turns out that she has dubious plans for the world that force the two of them to come into conflict with each other. Red featured a cameo appearance from Gear 5 over a year before its appearance in the anime, and with a box office gross of $246.5 million, it’s both the highest-grossing film in the franchise and the sixth highest-grossing Japanese film of all time.
One Piece boasts an impressive catalog of 17 films, going as far back as before the anime started. With such a large amount of movies, there’s naturally a lot to go through, but each film offers a unique take on One Piece, and for the most part, they each have something that makes them worth watching. All in all, One Piece having such a large collection is the perfect representation of how long it’s gone on as a franchise, and with any luck, there will be plenty more One Piecefilms to watch in the future.
