## Literature Review

One Piece just revealed the connection betwen the drums of liberation and one of the series most poular melodies which could prove a major fan theory.





In chapter 1095, Kuma&#39;s father expands on the legend of Nika that has been passed down among the Buccaneer race. Kuma&#39;s father also thumps his chest to the rhythm of Nika&#39;s drums, giving readers a clear picture of the exact rhythm of Nika&#39;s drums of liberation. This march-like rhythm is strongly reminiscent of Binks&#39; Sake, which suggests the song may be connected to Nika given the popular belief that the song actually tells the tale of Joyboy&#39;s adventures and his treasure.




                  One Piece Drops Huge Nika Clue That Changes Everything About Him   One Piece chapter 1073 ended with a big reveal about one of its characters, and what makes it even bigger is how it might tie into Nika.   


 Nika May Have Sung Binks&#39; Sake While Playing the Drums of Liberation 
The rhythm Nika&#39;s drums of liberation as replicated by Kuma&#39;s father in chapter 1095 fits almost perfectly with the intonation of Binks&#39; Sake, that is, the unique way in which the lyrics are stressed when sung suggesting the song may have been sung by Nika or made up by the people he rescued to the beat of his unique heartbeat. This similarity is most clear in the yodle that forms the chorus of the song. The connection between the two especially makes sense from a thematic point of view given the lighthearted tone of the song, making it the perfect accompaniment to the joy-bringing drums of liberation.

          




The connection between Binks&#39; Sake and the drums of liberation also lends further credibility to the popular theory most prominently proposed by Youtuber Artur which speculates that the final treasure may in fact be the sake the song references. The theory suggests that Binks&#39; Sake may actually tell the tale of the Void Century and Joyboy&#39;s many adventures on the sea which would make perfect sense if the song originated from people singing of Joyboy or Nika&#39;s adventures after he liberated them.

Moreover, the connection between the popular shanty and the drums of liberation might explain why the song is so well known despite many not knowing the truth behind it just like the mysterious &#39;D.&#39; initial whose meaning has also been lost to time. Nevertheless, Eiichiro Oda does like to leave behind subtle instances of foreshadowing and though this theory remains in the realm of speculation at present, a connection between Nika and one of the most iconic melodies in One Piece would certainly make for an interesting reveal.
