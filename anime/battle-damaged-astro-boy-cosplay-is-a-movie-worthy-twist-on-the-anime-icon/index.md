## Literature Review

Mighty Atom from Astro Boy got a fantastic reinterpretation that depicts the inner workings of the boy robot after receiving some battle scars.





The cosplay, originally captured by Jen Yates&#39;s Instagram account, is credited to the cosplayer known as &#34;Molotov Baily&#34; / &#34;Doctor Molotov&#34;. Molotov&#39;s Facebook account describes the costume maker as an artist. According to image uploads, their other work includes costumes and puppets inspired by other media like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Labyrinth.





 

Atom&#39;s design in the cosplay is an incredible piece of work, highlighting the traditionally innocent hero&#39;s potential to look much more grim. The cosplay is undeniably creepy, showing the true machinery behind Atom&#39;s normal appearance.

  

                  Netflix&#39;s Dark Take on a Beloved Manga Franchise Could Be The Year&#39;s Best Anime   Netflix continues its expansion into the world of anime with the adaptation of a manga masterpiece that looks to be an instant classic.   


 Battle-damaged Atom is a Unique Look at Classic Designs 

 




According to Molotov Baily, the design for the Atom cosplay was inspired by the 12&#39;&#39; figure of the character produced by the company Blitzway. The figure includes removable panels that expose the boy robot&#39;s inner works, including a chest section that depicts a hinged panel that exposes Atom&#39;s mechanical heart. The decision to portray a battle-damaged Atom is a bold choice: while he&#39;s been involved in some serious battles, Tezuka&#39;s manga and its various adaptations never dared to show graphic injuries on their hero. This wrecked envisioning of him lends itself to a different kind of realism not seen before.

Other adaptations have tried to take the 1952 manga in new directions: the 2009 American movie tried for more realistic lighting and shading while shucking on some clothes, while Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Pluto chose to imagine Atom&#39;s advanced nature as being as near human as possible. Molotov Bailey&#39;s cosplay hearkens back to the classic design while making Atom&#39;s internal machinery a reality, rather than Tezuka&#39;s suggestions to his readers. This sort of realism - taking a concept at face value and filling out its gaps - is welcome, compared to the other takes, which instead choose to literally cover up Atom&#39;s original design.




The cosplay of the original design by such a talented artist, and shaped in such a unique way, only goes to show the enduring popularity of the manga even when its presence in public consciousness is minimal. While the upcoming Netflix adaptation of Pluto is Atom&#39;s next big showing, the last all-audience adaption came out a decade ago, in 2003. Tezuka&#39;s characters have otherwise been relegated to being part of near-unnoticed shows aimed at preschoolers, while plans for a live-action movie remain in the air. Despite that, Molotov&#39;s stunning costume design shows that despite all that, Astro Boy remains unforgettable.
