## Literature Review

In Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission, Goku&#39;s brother Raditz finally makes his return after decades and debuts his Super Saiyan 3 form.




A long-running internet joke became a reality in the Dragon Ball franchise when Goku&#39;s brother Raditz finally achieved Super Saiyan 3 form in the spin-off manga Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission. In the decades that Dragon Ball has existed, fans have created many jokes and memes concerning various characters undergoing hilarious transformations. Examples of this include transformations like Super Saiyan Nappa, whose mustache grows over his eyes, or Super Saiyan 6 Goku with golden fur.




First debuting in Dragon Ball chapter 195, titled “The Mysterious Warrior From Space,” Raditz quickly shocked fans across the world with the revelation that he was Goku’s alien brother from another planet. His design was striking, as he possessed armor unlike anything seen before in the series. His long black hair also provided an immediate connection to Goku and eventually became a defining trait of Saiyans. A few years later Super Saiyan 3 would be introduced in the Majin Buu arc, with extremely long hair going well past the user’s waist. Fans of the series immediately began speculating about a hypothetical Super Saiyan 3 form for Raditz that featured his already uniquely long hair growing to completely ridiculous proportions. Decades later, their dream has finally come true.


 Raditz Achieved Super Saiyan 3 
          




In Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission chapter 3, a Raditz from an as-yet undisclosed timeline makes an appearance in the Super Space-Time Tournament. There, he finds the power-hungry Turles and the two of them quickly clash. Raditz wastes no time unleashing his newfound Super Saiyan 3 form, and it’s just as ridiculous as fans would expect. There is quite literally not a single panel in the entire fight that manages to show where Raditz’ hair as a Super Saiyan 3 ends. This transformation is honestly fan service at its best, playing up a joke readers have been thinking of for years.

Raditz’ Super Saiyan 3 form also has several wild implications upon taking a deeper look at the character’s design. Most strikingly, Raditz still has his tail. Now, Raditz being able to access Super Saiyan 3 would logically mean he has the ability to use the previous transformations, Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2. This means that Raditz meets pretty much every requirement necessary to become a Super Saiyan 4 under the right conditions. He can still transform into a Great Ape, and has awakened the power of Super Saiyan necessary to become a Golden Great Ape. Though he loses his battle with Turles in a pretty embarrassing fashion, it&#39;s not unlikely Raditz will crop up again, and possibly with the power of Super Saiyan 4.






 How Does Raditz&#39; Super Saiyan 3 Stack Up to Goku&#39;s? 
          

Given how rapidly Raditz was defeated by Turles, the odds are that his Super Saiyan 3 wouldn&#39;t even hold a candle to Goku&#39;s. Goku was able to go toe-to-toe with Buu in his Super Saiyan 3 state, and Buu was a much deadlier opponent than Turles ever was. While Goku doesn&#39;t use Super Saiyan 3 much, as the state is well known for its drawbacks when it comes to speed and power consumption, it seems like an easy call as to which one would be stronger. For that matter, even Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks could likely deal with Raditz with ease, and they&#39;re still just children.

Raditz has been the butt of a long-running joke for the better part of two decades now. He is, in essence, the Yamcha of the Saiyans. His epithet is even Raditz “the Runt.” His return as a Super Saiyan 3 in Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission keeps playing into that idea with Raditz&#39; ridiculous transformation and swift defeat at the hands of another Saiyan. With more timelines being introduced every chapter, however, this unruly Saiyan may be coming back sooner than Dragon Ball fans think.
