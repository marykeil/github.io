  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The My Hero Academia anime has several memorable and catchy opening songs and animations, but how do they stack up against each other?</p>
<p>My Hero Academia is a critically successful anime that is complemented by some truly memorable openings. The opening theme of an anime is often the first thing a viewer sees when starting a new series. Between the songs and animations, the introduction greatly affects whether someone continues watching the show. First impressions are important, and some anime openings just do not hit the mark.
The openings for My Hero Academia do not suffer from this issue, however. Every opening from Uverworld&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Future&rdquo; to Eve&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bokurano&rdquo; has features that make them memorable anime openings. MHA provides consistent openings, and every fan will likely have a different rank for each one depending on personal preference.
My Hero Academia Openings in Release Order    Song   Artist    &ldquo;The Day&rdquo;   Porno Graffitti    &ldquo;Peace Sign&rdquo;   Kenshi Yonezu    &ldquo;Sora ni Utaeba&rdquo;   Amazarashi    &ldquo;Odd Future&rdquo;   Uverworld    &ldquo;Make My Story&rdquo;   Lenny Code Fiction    &ldquo;Polaris&rdquo;   Blue Encount    &ldquo;Starmaker&rdquo;   KANA-BOON    &ldquo;No. 1&rdquo;   DISH//    &ldquo;Merry-Go-Round&rdquo;   MAN WITH A MISSION    &ldquo;Hitamuki&rdquo;   SUPER BEAVER    &ldquo;Bokurano&rdquo;   Eve</p>
<p>11  Opening 7 - Starmaker
KANA-BOON</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starmaker&rdquo; is an opening that appears in a more lighthearted segment of the show where the heroes have recently overcome great adversity and are getting some downtime before the next challenge appears. The music has a very upbeat and almost carefree feel to it, which many fans love for its change of pace from the more serious themes that action anime tends to have. KANA-BOON does a great job capturing the vibe of the show at this point, which is a great feat that many openings do not accomplish.
The animation for this opening compliments the music very well with its fun nature and vibrant colors. The images of the heroes participating in more casual tasks are a nice touch that stands out due to most openings showing more action-based sequences. Seeing the heroes wearing everyday clothing and the ending frame showing them with instruments highlights the main event of this section of the story beautifully.</p>
<p>10  Opening 5 - Make My Story
Lenny Code Fiction</p>
<p>If there was an opening song title that completely encapsulates what My Hero Academia is all about, &ldquo;Make My Story&rdquo; has to be it. The rock and roll tone of the song fits perfectly with the intense battles that take place in many of the episodes that this opening leads into. This theme checks all the boxes when it comes to being catchy, memorable, and fun while staying relevant to the current story of the show.
Any time an opening showcases new characters, it immediately becomes much more interesting. Seeing all the heroes from the other hero schools in the My Hero Academia universe in this way helps to expand the world the moment the viewer watches this intro and makes viewers want to learn more about these new faces. The fast-paced changes from moment to moment in the animation match the fast-paced nature of the Provisional License Exam, which is where the plot is focused during this portion of the show.</p>
<p>9  Opening 2 - Peace Sign
Kenshi Yonezu</p>
<p>This fan-favorite opening stays in the memories of many fans of My Hero Academia because it serves as the theme for the tournament arch of the show; a trope that most fans of action anime love every time it comes up. The fast-paced rhythm of the drums helps drive the energy necessary for this opening theme to truly represent this pivotal moment in the series. The use of the verses to swell into a big chorus serves as a nod to each character training until the big tournament arrives, where the chorus kicks in to represent the active conflict taking place.
The scenes showing a typical training montage during the verses of the song help to hone in on the intent of the music to build up to the chorus, where the animation shows more fast-paced fight scenes unfolding. As the song begins to wrap up, images flash through of several of the protagonists, specifically those who have the most growth during the tournament. Then the iconic still frame of all the Class 1-A students as the song&rsquo;s outro plays puts a nice bow on this masterpiece of anime openings.</p>
<p>8  Opening 6 - Polaris
Blue Encount</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polaris&rdquo; is an anime opening that does a fantastic job highlighting the growth of each of the characters from My Hero Academia through the song and animation alone. This intro comes at a time when the hero students are undergoing intense work studies as the next step in their journey to becoming full-fledged heroes. The song highlights this with the change in pace between the verses, bridge, and chorus, which helps symbolize growth, reflection, and application of everything they have been training for.
The animation for &ldquo;Polaris&rdquo; might be some of the best out of all the MHA openings to date. During the verses, the hero students are shown with their new work-study mentors, indicating an aspect of growth that pairs well with the pacing of the song. The animation during the bridge shows All Might reflecting on his past with his mentor and former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, matching perfectly with the change in tone of the song. With the chorus being highlighted by the more action-packed scenes and the ending showing an emotional scene of Deku trying to reach Eri, it is no wonder this opening captured the hearts of many.</p>
<p>7  Opening 3 - Sora Ni Utaeba
Amazarashi</p>
<p>By the point &ldquo;Sora Ni Utaeba&rdquo; makes its appearance midway through season 2, most viewers have become truly invested in My Hero Academia, and this opening makes it hard not to be. The music is intense throughout and its driving energy is enough to make someone feel like they could &ldquo;Detroit Smash&rdquo; through a steel wall. A nice touch that easily catches listeners&rsquo; attention is the change from tenor vocals to alto vocals during the chorus when the title of the song is sung.
It is easy to see how much thought went into the animation for this opening, as it almost serves as a timeline for season 2 so that viewers have a good indication of where things are going simply by watching the intro. The first portion is spent showing the hero students working during their internships, which leads into the fight against Stain in Hosu, followed by the two-on-one battles of the UA students against their teachers to close out the season. Beyond this well-thought-out timeline, the scenes representing the fight with Stain followed by the images of the League of Villains help to foreshadow a link between the two that fans get to learn more about throughout the show.</p>
<p>6  Opening 11 - Bokurano
Eve</p>
<p>The latest opening from the second half of season 6 of MHA is one that shows a drastic change in the tone of the show moving forward. After the tragic events that occurred in the first half, the music almost has a more solemn tone to it at the beginning, which could also be used to reflect the emotions of Deku and his friends after he left them to protect them from the next conflict that would inevitably occur between him and Shigaraki/All For One. The chorus does bring the pace up some after showing some signs of Midoriya reuniting with his classmates, but for the most part, &ldquo;Bokurano&rdquo; helps viewers prepare for the events to come. <br>
It is easy for most people to see that the overall animation has been dulled down quite a bit to indicate a darker theme. This is also the first glimpse that viewers get of &ldquo;Dark Deku&rdquo; since leaving his classmates, and the almost emotionless expression on his face and the torn hero uniform he wears help show the burden he carries and the strain it has had on him over time. One part that stands out is the ripping away of Shigaraki&rsquo;s modern form to show his inner child, highlighting the part of him that Deku believes is crying out to be saved.</p>
<p>5  Opening 8 - No. 1
DISH//</p>
<p>Moving to a more light-hearted opening, &ldquo;No. 1&rdquo; comes after the U.A. School Festival, putting the hero students back in their hero outfits and taking on their next challenge on the road to finishing their first year. The overall direction of the music inspires thoughts of fun, camaraderie, and maybe even a little excitement about what is to come. The syncopated piano rhythms and fast-paced drums build plenty of energy in the song and set the tone for this part of the show.
The animation for opening 8 focuses on highlighting each of the characters that will be involved in the next test, highlighting each member of class 1-A and then 1-B as a group, with a sneak peek at the reappearance of Hitoshi Shinso. Each student can be seen casually preparing for the test, conversing with each other, and in an overall more relaxed mood before the chorus kicks in, which naturally shows them in more combat-oriented scenes. The bow on top of the animation is the inclusion of the scenes of the instructors smiling and showing a degree of excitement about what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>4  Opening 10 - Hitamuki
SUPER BEAVER</p>
<p>Opening 10 is one that many fans of MHA recall with ease due to it serving as the intro for, arguably, the most intense part of the anime to date. It is during this time that the heroes and villains are essentially in an all-out war between good and evil that has stakes that are higher than ever: the Paranormal Liberation War. The music highlights this with the harder rock style that persists throughout the song, and the high level of energy throughout.
One of the more interesting aspects of this opening is the drastic change in animation style in comparison to each of the previous openings. Though it seems simplistic, the use of manga-style artwork and panels with written sound effects is something that has not been seen a lot in anime openings, and it adds a truly unique feel to the overall animation of &ldquo;Hitamuki&rdquo;. The shift into an art style that is more similar to that of the anime kicks in around the chorus of the song, making for a natural transition that works extremely well for an opening like this.</p>
<p>3  Opening 1 - The Day
Porno Graffitti</p>
<p>When someone begins watching an anime, it is always difficult to forget the very first opening, and &ldquo;The Day&rdquo; is no exception to this. The music is catchy, fast-paced, and has several transitions throughout, making it easy for fans to fall in love with it. The four-on-the-floor bass drum drives this song and does a good job of not only making it hard not to jam with the music, but it also captures the sense of urgency that the show seems to always have. The first opening&rsquo;s animation is arguably the most important that an anime will ever have, as it is truly the first overall impression of a show that people will have, and My Hero Academia does not disappoint.
From the beginning, fans are immediately able to get a sense of the type of character Izuku Midoriya is as he walks around with thoughts of his hero notes and can be seen in the first frame basking in the glow of his favorite hero, All Might. The animation is also designed in such a way that viewers can get an introduction of every single character that is introduced in the first season and are even given a glimpse of what type of power they have. This may seem like a common occurrence in anime, but the fact is that few anime introduce so many key characters as early on as MHA does, and the opening covers each one of them beautifully.</p>
<p>2  Opening 9 - Merry-Go-Round
MAN WITH A MISSION</p>
<p>Every fan of My Hero Academia who has made it to the second half of season 5 has had the pleasure of being introduced to one of the catchiest openings in modern anime. &ldquo;Merry-Go-Round&rdquo; is quite the ride from the beginning with isolated vocals, transitions from English to Japanese, and dramatic changes in musical style throughout the song. There are so many parts that stand out from the &ldquo;Hey brother listen&rdquo; at the beginning to &ldquo;The carousel goes up and goes down&rdquo; at the bridge that make it easy to play this song on repeat.
The scenes in this opening focus highly on two groups of interest; Deku, Bakugo, and Todoroki, who have all been recognized by the show&rsquo;s characters and fans to be the strongest students in class 1-A, followed by the League of Villains. During this time, the students have experienced several encounters with the League of Villains and have an understanding that they need to grow to defend the things they care about, and the animation truly reflects this with the scenes of them resting as the sun sets and the ones of them &ldquo;chasing&rdquo; after the new number one hero, Endeavor.</p>
<p>1  Opening 4 - Odd Future
Uverworld</p>
<p>Finally, the penultimate opening from My Hero Academia, &ldquo;Odd Future&rdquo;. This opening has been in the hearts, minds, and playlists of not only MHA fans but fans of anime music in general. When an opening song transcends its fanbase, that is a true indication of just how good it is. The catchy rhythms provided by the synthesizer, the multiple changes in tone, and the intense vocals all come together to make this musical masterpiece.
The only thing that is better than the music of opening 4 is the animation. There are so many scenes that stand out, and they play so well into the song. Deku&rsquo;s reflection on his journey at the beginning is powerful because fans are all too aware of how far he has come in his journey to mastering One For All. However, the most powerful scene in this opening, and potentially in every MHA opening, takes place as soon as the chorus kicks in where All Might is seen powering up in traditional anime fashion. This is emotional, iconic, and exhilarating for nearly every fan of the show, making &ldquo;Odd Future&rdquo; stand out from the other My Hero Academia openings.

My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &ldquo;One-For-All&rdquo; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
