The manga currently focuses on an expedition to the Dark Continent, which has been the series&rsquo; biggest mystery since its existence was revealed.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Despite its excellent storytelling, Hunter x Hunter has left fans puzzled with some unanswered questions over the years.</p>
<p>Since its release over 25 years ago, Hunter x Hunter has been delighting fans with its unconventional storytelling, but the series also has plenty of mysteries that it needs to answer before its ending. Hunter x Hunter uses a diverse cast of characters to illustrate the different sides of humanity in a fantasy world, leading to many surprises along the way. Throughout its run, the series has also subverted many of the common tropes associated with Shōnen manga.
Despite having some of the best world-building in anime, the story has left some areas unexplored. This has led to some lengthy discussions and fascinating theories over the years. While the creator, Yoshihiro Togashi, has been known to revisit concepts from time to time, the current hiatus has fans wondering if Hunter x Hunter&rsquo;s biggest mysteries will ever be solved.</p>
<p>10  Sonata of Darkness
The Mysterious Sheet Music Gave Melody Her Supernatural Hearing</p>
<p>The Sonata of Darkness is a piece so cursed that it&rsquo;s said to be composed by the Devil himself. Melody tells Kurapika that her appearance was altered by listening to the flute solo and that her friend who played it died. While the chain user is initially skeptical of her story, she shows him her arm, which was deformed from the incident. Despite the legend, the piece&rsquo;s true origins and the nature of its curse are a mystery. Unfortunately, the Sonata of Darkness is never mentioned again, and its whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
<p>9  Gon&rsquo;s Nen
Gon Almost Dies While Trying to Avenge Kite</p>
<p>While fighting Neferpitou, Gon makes a condition where he trades all his Nen potential for an instant surge of power. However, this comes at the cost of his life, and he&rsquo;s left in critical condition until Nanika heals him. According to his father, Gon still has Nen in his body, but he can&rsquo;t use it since he is back to &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; If this theory is correct, Gon will have to reopen his aura nodes and train to regain his powers. The spiky-haired Enhancer is currently recuperating on Whale Island, so it&rsquo;s unknown whether his Nen will ever return.</p>
<p>8  Gyro&rsquo;s Role in the Story
The Former King Still Has the Loyalty of His Former Subjects</p>
<p>Gyro is introduced in a flashback as the king of the Neo-Green Life (NGL) Autonomous Region. After killing his abusive father, he creates a dangerous drug and releases it as part of his plan to spread evil throughout the world. While his current whereabouts are a mystery, it&rsquo;s said that he became a Chimera Ant and left the NGL to continue pursuing his goals. Despite the chilling origin story, Gyro has yet to officially appear in the story. This raises questions about his role in the series, with many speculating that he may appear in the future as a greater threat.</p>
<p>Hunter X Hunter Just Changed Everything We Know About Nen
The already ultra-complicated Nen power system in Hunter x Hunter got even more complex after the release of a lot of shocking new information.</p>
<p>7  The Kurta Clan
The Details Surrounding The Clan&rsquo;s Origin and Downfall Are a Mystery</p>
<p>The Nomadic Kurta Clan was known by flesh collectors for their Scarlet Eyes, which are said to be one of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful colors. Five years before the Hunter Exam, the clan&rsquo;s members were massacred by the Phantom Troupe. Kurapika, who was traveling at the time, became the tragedy&rsquo;s only survivor and swore to avenge his people. It&rsquo;s unclear how the bandits knew of the clan&rsquo;s location, or why they killed them in the first place. The Kurta&rsquo;s origins are also enshrouded in mystery, and very little is known about them other than what has already been revealed.</p>
<p>6  Pariston Hill&rsquo;s True Goal
The Former Chairman Has An Overwhelming Influence Over the Hunter Association</p>
<p>A Triple-Star-Hunter and former Vice Chairman of the Hunter Association, Pariston Hill is a sly, manipulative individual. During the three years of his tenure, a total of 18 Hunters went missing, and it&rsquo;s been implied that he has ties to the underworld. Pariston openly says he enjoys being hated, so he frequently tests the patience of his colleagues. Despite his intelligence and power, his actions are unpredictable, and his true motives remain unclear. This puts everyone around him on edge, since he is potentially one of the most dangerous characters in the series.</p>
<p>5  Ging&rsquo;s Nen Ability
Gon Freecss&rsquo; Father is Introduced As an Exceptional Nen User</p>
<p>A famous archaeologist and Ruins Hunter, Ging Freecss is set up as an enigma from the beginning of the story. He constantly evades Gon&rsquo;s attempts to find him and only appears when he is summoned for a meeting with his colleagues. Several characters have praised Ging, with Netero even calling him one of the top five Nen users in the world. Despite this, he is rarely shown using his abilities, so the true extent of his power remains unknown. Ging is also implied to be extremely intelligent and is considered by many to be one of the series&rsquo; smartest characters.</p>
<p>4  Gon&rsquo;s Mother
The Enhancer&rsquo;s Parentage Has Captivated Fans From the Very Beginning</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Gon&rsquo;s mother is unimportant to the story, but this hasn&rsquo;t stopped fans from coming up with wild theories. When Gon returns to Whale Island after learning Nen, he learns that Ging left a message for him in a tape recording. When it gets to the topic of his mother, Gon immediately turns off the cassette player and says that Mito is his mother. The story never returns to the subject, but Ging&rsquo;s intriguing message has left a mark on the anime community, with many wondering about the identity of the protagonist&rsquo;s other parent.</p>
<p>3  Don Freecss and The Journey to the New World
The Author Shares His Last Name With Ging and Gon</p>
<p>Three hundred years ago, a man named Don Freecss traveled to the Dark Continent and explored the shores of Lake Mobius. He compiled his travels in a journal called &ldquo;Journey to the New World,&rdquo; but only the East Edition has been found. According to Ging, there are three possible reasons why the West Edition is missing. The first is that it hasn&rsquo;t been found yet, and the second is that it was never written. However, the third, and eeriest reason is that the author is still writing it. This raises many questions about Don Freecss&rsquo; identity and the Dark Continent.</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter&rsquo;s Story Would Be Completely Different If The Author Had His Way
Hunter X Hunter would have started in a much different manner had Togashi had more creative freedom.</p>
<p>2  Hisoka&rsquo;s Past
The Magician&rsquo;s Origins Could Explain His Unique Personality</p>
<p>A talented Nen user and flamboyant individual, Hisoka quickly established himself as a fan-favorite character. His unique personality and trademark Bungee Gum ability have led to many speculations about his past, especially since the man himself is uninterested in discussing it. Various characters have alluded to the magician&rsquo;s past exploits, particularly through his battles and murderous tendencies, but very little is known about him apart from this. In 2016, Sui Ishida, the author of Tokyo Ghoul, published a one-shot with his take on Hisoka&rsquo;s backstory. Unfortunately, this work is most likely non-canon to the main story.</p>
<p>1  The Dark Continent
The Existence of &ldquo;Another World&rdquo; Shows That Hunter x Hunter&rsquo;s Story is Just Beginning</p>
<p>The manga&rsquo;s current story arc focuses on an expedition to the Dark Continent that&rsquo;s being led by the Hunter Association. Cheadle Yorkshire, the new Chairman, reveals that the Chimera Ants are only B-level threats and that what lies in the new land is much more dangerous. As there are many civilians on board, including the Kakin Royal Family, the ship will drop them off at the New Continent, which is an island close to the waters of the actual destination. The Dark Continent surrounds the enormous Lake Mobius which houses the Known World in its center, showing that the world seen until now in the series is only a small fraction of the real world.
While there have been 149 recorded voyages to the Dark Continent, only five were ever successful and resulted in the few survivors bringing back one of the Five Threats. If this isn&rsquo;t terrifying enough, all voyagers must first land on the New Continent and be granted passage by a mysterious being called the Gatekeeper. The existence of a &ldquo;true world&rdquo; is the most shocking twist in the story, but it could address some of the biggest questions in the series. With the many legends surrounding it, the Dark Continent continues to be the most intriguing mystery from Hunter x Hunter.
The Hunter x Hunter manga is available from MANGA Plus and Viz Media. The anime is available on Crunchyroll.
