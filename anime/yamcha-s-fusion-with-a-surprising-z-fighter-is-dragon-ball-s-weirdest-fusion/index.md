# Yamcha s Fusion With a Surprising Z Fighter Is Dragon Ball s Weirdest Fusion


## SUMMARY 



  Yamcha and Chiaotzu&#39;s fusion in &#34;That Time I Got Reincarnated As Yamcha&#34; is undoubtedly Dragon Ball&#39;s weirdest fusion.   The fusion between Yamcha and Chiaotzu was made possible through special rings created by Bulma.   Despite their attempt at fusion, Yamcha and Chiaotzu ultimately decide not to battle in their fused form due to their ridiculous appearance.

## Literature Review

Fans often joke about silly fusions in Dragon Ball Z, but one side manga actually took a goofy fusion pairing and ran with it, to incredible results.




The concept of fusion is a favorite among Dragon Ball fans, with an endless number of possible combinations between characters, but one of the least likely actually appeared in official Dragon Ball media. That, of course, was the pairing of Yamcha and Chiaotzu in That Time I Got Reincarnated As Yamcha.




That Time I Got Reincarnated As Yamcha by Dragongarow LEE is a spinoff manga that was officially released through Shonen Jump&#39;s online service, running from late 2016 to 2017. It tells the story of a kid who&#39;s seemingly from the real world being reincarnated as Yamcha, Isekai style, into the Dragon Ball universe. The new Yamcha uses his encyclopedic knowledge of Dragon Ball to acquire all kinds of power-ups that Yamcha never received, and one of those involved learning the Fusion Dance.

          

Discovering someone else who was reincarnated into this universe as Chiaotzu, they eventually fuse to combine their powers in a mini-chapter bonus scene that seems to only be available in the collected volume, entitled &#34;The Reincarnated Ones&#39; Special Plan.&#34;





 Yamcha and Chiaotzu&#39;s Fusion is Undoubtedly Dragon Ball&#39;s Weirdest 
          

The fused Yamcha and Chiaotzu, which never gets a proper name (either Yamzu or Chiaochu), is created right before the Cell Games begin, with the intention of using their new fused power to battle Cell. Normally, fusion would require two fighters at comparable power levels and of similar size, but Yamcha and Chiaotzu are able to use special rings made by Bulma that facilitate fusions between those of dissimilar status. However, when the combined being gets a glimpse of what they look like together, the pair find themselves too ridiculous to battle in this condition, and ultimately defuse.

Of course, in the main series, neither Yamcha nor Chiaotzu ever participate in a fusion, and if the result here is any indication, they&#39;re right not to try. By the time fusion is first used in Dragon Ball Z, Yamcha and Chiaotzu have fallen too far behind every other character to even consider it with anyone else. It&#39;s this fear of falling behind that prompts them to attempt fusion in the first place, but the fact of the matter is that after all the power-ups he&#39;s already accumulated, this reincarnated Yamcha is already near his maximum power level. Even with every advantage in his favor, Yamcha will never be able to keep up with Goku, and fusion won&#39;t change that.






 The Yamcha Isekai Is An Entertaining Story For Dragon Ball Fans 
          

That Time I Got Reincarnated as Yamcha obviously capitalized on the recent isekai trend, but it is still a great read for dedicated Dragon Ball fans, taking the fact that fans make fun of Yamcha and running with it to create a fun and entertaining story. The fusion is one of the weirdest and most noteworthy, but there are plenty more, like Yamcha traveling to Planet Namek to have his potential unlocked by Guru. Yamcha may be derided as one of the most useless characters in the main canon of Dragon Ball, but this spinoff manga helps vindicate the maligned hero, all with the right dose of comedy, highlighted by the weirdest fusion in the series.
