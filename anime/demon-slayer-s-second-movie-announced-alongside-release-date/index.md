As typical of Ufotable and anime movies, this upcoming Demon Slayer will feature world-class animation which should be further enhanced by the 4K and IMAX experience. The tickets will be available to buy starting December 22, 2023, with three types to choose from. The hype is unreal for this upcoming arc, and although it will be short, the arcs after, such as the Infinite Castle arc, are one of the most anticipated ones of the entire series.

Demon Slayer movies are almost always successful, with the Mugen Train film shattering records in Japan and all over the world. This is only possible due to the breathtaking animation that the series is lauded for, and is usually hailed as having the best animation ever. From people who are trying out anime for the first time to veterans who have been watching the medium for years, Demon Slayer is a hit for everyone and is one of the best representations of shonen anime seen in a very long time.
