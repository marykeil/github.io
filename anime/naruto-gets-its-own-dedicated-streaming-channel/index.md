## Literature Review

Naruto now has its own dedicated channel on PlutoTV, increasing the streaming service&#39;s anime offerings. The hit show joins Sailor Moon and Yu-Gi-Oh!




After previously offering a dedicated Sailor Moon channel, PlutoTV has added one for Naruto. Available in two different streaming options, as well as in Spanish, now is the best time for anime fans to revisit or experience the hit anime for the first time. One of its spin-offs has also been made available.




PlutoTV is a free service that uses ads to support the many series it offers either on-demand or as watchable channels. These channels air episodes continuously, but the streamer also offers films to watch. Some of its current offerings include Sailor Moon, Naruto, Lupin the Third, One Piece, and Yu-Gi-Oh! amongst others.

          

It also features anime films including Ghost in the Shell, Millennium Actress, The Professional Golgo 13, and Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Movie. PlutoTV is proving to be a major player within the streaming arena. While Spanish offerings are slightly more limited, it still includes hit series like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Naruto, and Shaman King. 


 Naruto Joins PlutoTV With Multiple Viewing Options 
          




There are currently two options for fans to watch the first series of Naruto. The first four seasons are available as a channel that plays continuously, as well as on demand. This means fans familiar with it can turn on the channel and let it run wherever it is, revisiting it as they would have when it aired. Anime viewers new to the series can use the on-demand option to start at the beginning and keep track of their progress through it at their convenience. As a result, fans now have easier access to hit anime series than ever before.

                  Naruto Was Supposed to Return With 4 New Episodes... So Where is it?   With so little information about the new 4-episode Naruto anime special, theories &amp; speculation on why it&#39;s taking extra time to develop are growing.   

At present, neither of the sequel series, Naruto: Shippuden nor Boruto: Naruto Next Generations are available to stream on PlutoTV. However, Naruto Spin-Off: Rock Lee &amp; His Ninja Pals is also available on demand, featuring fifty-one episodes, which adapts Kenji Taira&#39;s spin-off manga. This series adds even more options for Naruto fans to watch their favorite characters in very humorous situations. Given PlutoTV&#39;s current success and new additions to the service, hopefully it will add Naruto: Shippuden in the future so viewers can continue watching the titular hero improve his ninja skills and battle increasingly dangerous foes.






 How Many Hours of Naruto Are Now Available? 
          

Currently, all 220 episodes of the first series are available on PlutoTV. At approximately 23 minutes per episode, there are around 84 hours of Naruto to watch. Naruto Spin-off: Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals adds another 20 hours of viewing, giving fans over one hundred hours for this franchise. As a result, a complete binge of these offerings will take a while! Nonetheless, the new Naruto channel on Pluto TV is the perfect time to watch the shinobi of the Hidden Leaf Village grow from kids to exceptional ninjas capable of taking on deadly enemies and protecting their home.
