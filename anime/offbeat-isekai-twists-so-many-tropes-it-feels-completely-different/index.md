## Literature Review

Behind The Battle Of The Hero And The Demon King shares traits with the villainess isekai genre â€“ but pushes its themes to their limits.




The title of the isekai series Behind The Battle Of The Hero And The Demon King might sound incredibly generic, but the actual story and setup couldn&#39;t be more offbeat. Part of this derives from the fact that the manga contorts so many well-known tropes into something completely unrecognizable even though it&#39;s from a highly formulaic genre. However, this manga deviates much more from the rest than that.




Created by Suzuki Yuuki and artist Ashio Ranteira, Behind The Battle Of The Hero And The Demon King can be defined as a villainess gaming isekai whose protagonist is not only a man, but who doesn&#39;t have any relationship with the hero in the game&#39;s world. This, in and of itself, is a major upset, since the villainess naturally has a very combative relationship with the &#34;protagonist&#34;.

          

Instead, the protagonist is a no-name character named Verna who, like the stereotypical villainess, is destined to die, but that is the least of his troubles because he already accomplishes this in the series&#39; summarized prequel setup.

Verna&#39;s true mission is to protect the series&#39; hero, Mazell, at all costs, and therein lies half of the story&#39;s unique premise that separates it from most isekai. The story follows the deeply complex relationship between Verna and Mazell, and it&#39;s a positive one at that, as opposed to the fraught rivalry between the stereotypical villain and hero. From Verna&#39;s perspective, he initially didn&#39;t want to upset the flow of the game besides saving his own life, so he steered clear of Mazell. Obviously, this started out easily enough for Verna. He had been isekai&#39;d into a side character as opposed to a regular rival whose entire life is inherently intertwined in the heroine&#39;s existence, which is nearly impossible to deviate from when considering the laws of most gaming worlds. However, this becomes impossible even for Verna once he comes into contact with Mazell, who automatically feels drawn to him. Despite Mazell&#39;s status as a hero, he is quite a hopeless character, and as Verna continually comes to his aid, Verna can&#39;t help but change his initial plan by inevitably devoting his whole life to ensuring Mazell&#39;s safety.




Although the general blueprint is there, Behind The Battle Of The Hero And The Demon King&#39;s overall tone and direction completely dispels any of the normal feelings usually associated with an isekai. Mazell, the &#34;hero&#34;, doesn&#39;t despise the &#34;villain&#34; because of some major misunderstanding, and the &#34;villainess&#34; in this equation, or Verna, doesn&#39;t disdain the hero&#39;s unprecedented good luck. Some might point to I&#39;m in Love with the Villainess from Crunchyroll as something similar, but the tone and direction couldn&#39;t be more different. Even though I&#39;m in Love with the Villainess gets unexpectedly deep, the majority of the series follows the inappropriate fawning of the isekai&#39;d heroine Rae Taylor over a typical tsundere and the eponymous villainess who can&#39;t stand her. Other than the mutual respect between Mazell and Verna, there is also nothing to suggest that Mazell and Verna have deeper feelings for each other.

          




In addition to Behind The Battle Of The Hero And The Demon King&#39;s shift in tone and overall mangling of established tropes, the stunning artwork of artist Ashio Ranteira helps give the series a distinctive flavor that further separates it from other Isekai. Some might even compare it to the unique renderings of mangaka Mapollo 3, the creator behind Shonen Jump&#39;s PPPPPP. it helps elevate Behind The Battle Of The Hero And The Demon King beyond the competition as the writings of Suzuki Yuuki transport readers into a completely different world unlike any other isekai.
