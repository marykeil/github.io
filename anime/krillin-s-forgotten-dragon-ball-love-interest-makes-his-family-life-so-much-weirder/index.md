# Krillin s Forgotten Dragon Ball Love Interest Makes His Family-Life so Much Weirder


## SUMMARY 



  Krillin&#39;s ex-girlfriend Maron and his daughter Marron have oddly similar names, both referencing Krillin&#39;s own name.   Maron&#39;s brief appearance in Krillin&#39;s life and her resemblance to Bulma made for an interesting footnote in Krillin&#39;s family dynamics.   Krillin&#39;s choice to name his daughter Marron, despite the similarities to his ex&#39;s name, adds an extra layer of weirdness to his past relationships.

## Literature Review

Krillin had an ex named Maron who disappeared from Dragon Ball lore rather quickly, with his relationship with her making things weird for his family.




In the anime world of Dragon Ball, the Z-Fighter known as Krillin has been a staple hero in a series that has seen many, and is a character who has been at Goku’s side since the beginning. Often getting just as much story content and character development as the main Z-Warriors, Krillin once dated a woman named Maron and then, much later, fathered a child named Marron, with the eyebrow-raising similarities in their names turning his family life into something far weirder than expected.




Making her exclusive debut in the Dragon Ball Z anime, Maron was a girlfriend of Krillin’s who looked strangely familiar to Bulma, complete with similar light blue/teal hair color and hairstyle. Eventually running off with other admirers despite her proclaiming her love for Krillin, Maron hasn’t been a factor in Krillin’s life for a while now.

          

Years later, between the time Cell was defeated and the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, Krillin and Android 18 had a daughter named Marron, a character who takes after her father’s short stature and non-nosed look, as well as her mother’s flowing blonde hair. And it’s here where the odd parallels between Maron and Marron’s name get awkward.

                  Dragon Ball Super Finally Makes Krillin And 18 The Best Fighter Couple   Krillin and Android 18&#39;s unique relationship has just proven that they are the best couple in Dragon Ball Super when they&#39;re on the battlefield.    





 Krillin&#39;s Daughter Has The Same Name As His Ex-Girlfriend 
          

Called Kuririn in Japanese, the kuri or kurumi part of Kuririn/Krillin’s name stems from the word “chestnut,” with the “rin” meaning “shaolin” — a sort of joke by Dragon Ball’s creator Akira Toriyama about how Krillin has no hair. To complement that naming convention as Krillin’s on-again-off-again fling, Maron (written with one less “r”) is the French word for “chestnut,” with Krillin’s eventual child, Marron, having the same name translation, making Krillin’s forgotten love interest a weird footnote in his current family life, something that might eventually lead to an interesting conversation with his daughter somewhere down the line about where her name originated from.




Of course, the real reason both Maron and Marron have similar names makes total sense and is actually quite simple: both are puns on Krillin’s name, the Dragon Ball character they are most closely associated with. And regardless of the amusing reason for both characters having near identical names, Krillin giving his daughter one that has more than a passing semblance to an ex who was only in the picture for a brief moment is decidedly more weird than is probably necessary. Furthermore, Maron is at one point referenced in Dragon Ball Super when Android 18 threatens to kill Android 17 for pronouncing Marron&#39;s name like the original’s, a subtle difference that clearly isn’t lost on Krillin’s wife.



 Maron Shares A Name With Marron Making Things Weird For Krillin 
          

So while Krillin’s short-lived romance with a girl that has the exact same translated name as him doesn’t seem all that weird at first, Krillin going on to name his kid in an eerily similar way only spelled differently makes things a whole lot weirder, especially considering Android 18 knows more than she lets on about Krillin’s past relationships. Luckily, Maron hasn’t been seen in Dragon Ball lore for decades now and probably won’t be seen again, so it’s safe to say that Krillin’s love for the name can officially be passed on to the one “chestnut” he cares about most, his daughter, Marron.
