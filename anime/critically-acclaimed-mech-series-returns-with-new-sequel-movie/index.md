## Literature Review

Code Geass will receive yet another film scheduled in 2024 that will follow a different story to that of the original anime.




The beloved anime series Code Geass is returning for yet another movie after many years of radio silence. Hailed as one of the best anime ever and an icon of the mech genre, the war-filled series will receive another film that continues the previous one&#39;s story.




The project was announced back in December 2020, and fans had to wait for more than 2 years before any other information was released. As the days led up to December 20, 2023, it was announced that news regarding the project would be announced, breaking the long drought.


 

A trailer was released alongside a key visual and a list of the staff and cast. Titled Code Geass: Rozé of the Recapture, the movie will be released in May 2024.

Although one of the main reasons that fans fell in love with the series was because of the anti-hero main character Lelouch, it seems the movie will be focusing on two other characters, siblings Rozé and Ashe. The trailer perfectly displays how animation technology has advanced in recent years, with the animation being much more fluid and vibrant compared to the original anime. The movie will also not be shying away from Code Geass&#39; display of gore, with the trailer being as bloody as it can get.

From the makers of Inuyasha, Gundam, and Gintama, Studio Sunrise will continue animating the series and will bring aboard Takahiro Kimura who was the chief animation director of the Code Geass anime. Assisting him will be Hidekazu Shimamura, the director of YuYu Hakusho and animation director of two of the Code Geass movies. Kazuhiro Obata (My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising) will be the art director and the sound design is sure to be masterful given that the sound director of Fire Force, Horimiya, and Re: Zero Jin Aketagawa has been recruited. The staff is stacked, to say the least, with the studio throwing all its resources at the movie to make it a success.




The movie is confirmed to be released in Japan, and although it is not known when the international release will be, it can be estimated that it will be a few months later based on other popular anime movies. Although Lelouch doesn&#39;t appear in the trailer, there is a chance he might return as this movie follows the story of the movies, in which Lelouch regained his memories in the 2019 Code Geass movie and went on an adventure with C2. Nonetheless, the new characters look amazing and are more than enough by themselves. With such a cult following, Code Geass&#39; upcoming movie is sure to be a theatrical success.
