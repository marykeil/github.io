## Literature Review

A new character in 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You puts a dark twist on the popular Komi Can&#39;t Communicate.





Despite what Komi’s had to go through in life, Komi Can’t Communicate has always been a relatively lighthearted series, but The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You has a much darker take on its premise. Episode #3 introduced Rentaro’s third girlfriend, Shizuka Yoshimoto, and just like Komi, she’s a cute girl who’s so shy that she can only talk to others through text.




          

Shizuka and Komi follow the same archetype of shy anime girls, but 100 Girlfriends takes that idea far more seriously, and that says a lot about what it’s trying to do with its story.

                  Crunchyroll&#39;s New Romcom Anime Fixes One Of The Biggest Anime Cliches   The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You has finally premiered, and it fixes one of the biggest anime clichés.   


 100 Girlfriends Shows What Would Happen If Komi Can’t Communicate Wasn’t A Comedy 
          

Shizuka Yoshimoto from The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You essentially shows what would happen if Komi Can’t Communicate wasn’t a comedy. Unlike Komi, whose inability to speak never truly stopped people from liking her, Shizuka has been shown to have been bullied in the past because of her communication disorder, with even her own mother physically abusing her because she can’t speak normally. It’s a darker and more realistic depiction of what a character like Komi might have to live through, and it appropriately adds a lot of tragedy to Shizuka’s character.




                  Komi Can&#39;t Communicate Could Be A Bright Spot for Autistic Representation   The hero&#39;s difficulty speaking in the manga Komi Can&#39;t Communicate might be an example of positive representation of neurodivergent people.   

If there’s anything to take from The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You’s dark take on Komi Can’t Communicate, it’s that there will be more to its story than simple parody. While a big part of 100 Girlfriends’ premise is that each of Rentaro’s girlfriends is an exaggeration of a specific anime trope, Shizuka shows that it won’t always be played for laughs and that sometimes those tropes will be deconstructed to add some realism to the story. That doesn’t mean that Komi Can’t Communicate is bad for keeping things largely lighthearted, but it does do a lot to separate the writing styles of both anime.



 100 Girlfriends Episode #3 Shows That There’s More To It Than Just Parody 
          




That style of writing, in turn, adds a lot to 100 Girlfriends’ overall quality. It would have been easy enough to keep things at simple parody like Komi Can’t Communicate often does, but by showing that there will be moments of seriousness and genuine sincerity with Shizuka, people can expect a much more well-rounded series that isn’t afraid to put a pause on jokes for the sake of good character writing. There’s far more to look forward to in The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You than its ridiculous premise, and it will be great to see more of that in the upcoming weeks on Crunchyroll.

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You releases new episodes Sundays on Crunchyroll.
