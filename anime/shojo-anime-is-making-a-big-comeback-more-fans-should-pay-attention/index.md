## Literature Review

With the imminent return of the Kimi ni Todoko and the A Sign of Affection anime,, the scene is set for the triumphant return of shojo anime.





While shonen fans are spoiled for choice when it comes to anime adaptations, shojo titles have needed more love for years. Indeed, some of the most well-known manga titles ever, such as Sailor Moon, Fruit Basket, and Maid Sama, are all shojo. However, after enjoying an extended period of increased popularity during the first decade of the century, less shojo manga were being picked up for anime adaptations. Naturally, there are a number of reasons for this, but one of the more cogent explanations is that shonen series like Kaguya-Sama: Love is War and Don&#39;t Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro co-opted fundamental shojo elements into shonen-based stories.

 Shojo&#39;s Current Success Will Lead to More Opportunities 
          

This resurgence of interest in shojo anime and manga signals a return to the demographic&#39;s glory days. The more shojo shows that find success will naturally lead to increased opportunities for more series to be released in the future. Besides the two aforementioned upcoming titles, 2023 has seen the releases of some of the most currently popular titles in the demographic, including My Happy Marriage, My Love Story With Yamada-kun at Lv.999, and Sugar Apple Fairy Tale. Ultimately, shojo&#39;s comeback is a win for fans of the demographic, and for anime fans as a whole.

Moreover, the wealth of diversity in the new shojo anime series means that the demographic as a whole has been able to extend past or outside its traditional customs. Netflix Anime&#39;s Kimi ni Todoke is illustrative of this point. One of the common shojo tropes in shojo is the awkward girl&#39;s support of the equally awkward guy. That is, she plays the role of his psychological muse. However, in Kimi ni Todoke the role is reversed. While the main character - Sawako Kuronuma, gives plenty of emotional support to her boyfriend - Shota Kazehaya; it is Shota who provides Sawako with the lion&#39;s share of support. He even dutifully waits for her return after she goes off to college.






 The Future Of Shojo Anime 
          

This resurgence of shojo anime portends a deeper exploration of issues affecting young women. While many have long believed shojo anime to exclusively be romance stories or magical girl series, more anime and manga within this demographic have begun discussing topics outside the stereotypes that have plagued the demographic. Shows like Netflix&#39;s Kimi ni Todoke is helping to increase the shojo content available to enjoy while at the same time extending access out to communities that may have never thought anime had anything good to offer them.
