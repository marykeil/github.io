## Literature Review

Kodansha&#39;s December giveaway campaign is the perfect chance for manga fans to check out some hot series from Shueisha&#39;s main competitor.




Just in time for the holiday season, Kodansha Publishing is gifting free manga to anyone who puts in a timely request for its month-long giveaway campaign. It&#39;s the perfect year-end effort to get a leg up on the competition while promoting some of the best available manga content available from Shonen Jump&#39;s main competitor.




As announced by the Kodansha USA website, from December 1 to December 31, 2023, the &#34;Kodansha Countdown Giveaway&#34; will offer a free digital volume of one of its manga series every day for the month. The selected daily title will be available for the whole day that they are offered. They will not be available once the 24-hour mark tolls and a new daily title have been selected.


 

Currently, giveaways for Kodansha classics Don&#39;t Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro, Parasyte, BECK, and Matcha Made in Heaven have already been completed, but that leaves 27 more days, and 27 more titles – such as Blue Lock and Shangri-La Frontier still waiting to be given away.


 Kodansha Free Giveaway Is A Great Attempt To Put The Spotlight On Its Great Manga 
          




Kodansha&#39;s &#34;Countdown Giveaway&#34; is more than just fan service. It&#39;s an awesome move to claim market space from its rivals, especially its age-old competitor Shueisha, the publisher of Shōnen Jump. While the Kodansha-Shueisha competition is on a more equal footing in Japan, that&#39;s not the case internationally. Outside Japan, Shōnen Jump manga and anime dominate the industry. Their dominance, however, is not due to issues of quality. Kodansha has a cache of titles including Attack on Titan, Vinland Saga, and Ghost in The Shell, which are widely deemed some of the best manga and anime ever created.

The issue for Kodansha is promotion. Shueisha&#39;s Shōnen Jump was quicker to see the potential of the international market for manga and anime. Accordingly, they moved with alacrity to establish a presence abroad that could push its content. As such, Kodansha has been playing catch-up in creating an effective marketing campaign outside of Japan for its titles. In recent years, Kodansha&#39;s manga has managed to shrink the gap, and their Blue Lock claimed the spot for best-selling manga of 2023.






To have access to the free volumes, a reader must first sign up for Kodansha&#39;s free reader account. The account also gives users access to future giveaway campaigns.






 Kodansha Is Trying To   the Gap With Shueisha 
          

In 2023, Kodansha also launched its digital manga reading app K-Manga, in another effort to bridge the gap with Shueisha, which has seen incredible international success with MANGA Plus. The Countdown Giveaway is another campaign that aggressively moves to overcome Shueisha&#39;s market mastery by seeding the public fan base with free copies of its most popular titles. As they have correctly foreseen, few fans will turn down an offer for a free first volume. At the very least, it effectively gets Kodansha content out and in front of manga fans&#39; eyeballs. There&#39;s no doubt that it will turn more than a few to choose Kodansha as their &#34;go-to&#34; source of manga and anime.




For the first time in a long time, a Kodansha manga has beaten Shonen Jump for the title of best-selling manga of the year. Add to that the popularity of Attack on Titan&#39;s final season as well as the accolades received for titles such as Heavenly Delusion, Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch of Mercury, and Tokyo Revengers, and it&#39;s clear that Kodansha has had a banner year. Only time will tell how well this translates in comparison to Shōnen Jump, but for now, Kodansha is doing a great job in bridging the gap.
