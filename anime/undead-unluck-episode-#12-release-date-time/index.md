 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode #11? 
          




Undead Unluck episode #11, “Rio de Janeiro”, picked up where episode #10 left off with the members of The Union planning to infiltrate a black market auction of Negators and UMAs to find Unrepair. While shopping for proper disguises, Fuuko remembered how Juiz said that her Unluck might be the key to killing God and saving the world, so she asked Fuuko to try and fall in love with Andy to bring out its full potential. While Fuuko still had reservations about the idea, she still reassured him that she would always be there to bring him back if Victor took over again, thus solidifying the closeness of their bond.

At the yacht hosting the black market auction, Fuuko and Andy got to talking about how lonely the Negator being auctioned off must feel, which led to them talking about how much they’ve helped give each other something to fight for and further develop their relationship. At the same time, Tatiana alerted everyone to Unrepair and three other people infiltrating the yacht, with Juiz identifying them as Negator Hunters, the unofficial name of a group of people who kidnap Negators and kill anyone who isn’t useful to them.






 Undead Unluck Continues Moving Its Romance In A Positive Direction 
          

One of the biggest takeaways from Undead Unluck episode #11 is the positive direction in which Fuuko and Andy’s relationship is progressing. Continuing from what the Spoil arc did for their relationship, episode #11 has Fuuko and Andy talking earnestly about their feelings and how much being around each other has changed them, a far cry from the largely uncomfortable way their relationship is often depicted in the series, even at an early point in the same episode. Seeing Fuuko and Andy’s relationship develop more healthily is great, and hopefully, Undead Unluck will keep that development going.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #12 when it releases on December 22.
