## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #20 will show the aftermath of Nobara&#39;s brutal death and feature more intense fighting against the sadistic Mahito.




After a harrowing episode #19, Jujutsu Kaisen fans are anxiously awaiting Season 2 episode #20 to see the aftermath of Nobara&#39;s apparent death. Each of the last two episodes has delivered an absolutely brutal tragedy, which means that episode #20 could as well. However, the suffering that Jujutsu Kaisen inflicts upon both its characters and its fans makes it unique among many Shonen series.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #20 Releases 
          

If it isn&#39;t delayed, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #20 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, December 7. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on December 7 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #19? 
          




Episode #19 continued the two-fronted battle against Mahito and his clone. While Yuji battled the more powerful version below ground, Nobara fought the duplicate in the streets. In doing so, she realized that her Resonance cursed technique was especially effective against Mahito, which made her a major threat to the curse. As such, the clone fled the fight while Yuji delivered an incredibly cathartic beatdown on the temporarily weakened main body. However, eventually, Mahito was able to escape this pummeling and meet up with his fleeing clone, where he was able to touch Nobara&#39;s face, causing it to explode and seemingly kill her.



The episode also featured a flashback to Nobara&#39;s childhood before she died.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #20 Will Unleash Yuji&#39;s Rage 
          




Yuji was already furious at Mahito for all the disturbing villainous acts he commited as well as the brutal murders of Junpei and Nanami. This is what caused him to deliver such a brutal beatdown on the curse over the course of the last two episodes. Given Nobara was one of his best friends, the emotions he feels at her death will likely eclipse those he felt previously and drive him to fight with even more ferocity. Of course it could also have the opposite effect and completely break him, leaving him at Mahito&#39;s mercy. But if this happens, someone else would likely have to step in and take over the fight against Mahito, which would potentially be underwhelming.

Given the behind the scenes problems at Studio MAPPA, it is unclear what level of quality the remaining episodes of the season will be. However, the recent episodes have featured some truly great animation, giving fans hope that the coming episodes will also include some hype moments. If Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #20 matches the heights of the series’ best fights then it will be another great installment in the Shibuya Incident arc.
