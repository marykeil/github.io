# Dragon Ball Super &amp; Daima Could Be Connected Through One Big Event - Theory


## SUMMARY 



  Whis&#39;s comment about &#34;throwing off the time axis&#34; in Dragon Ball Super suggests a connection to Dragon Ball DAIMA&#39;s premise of reversing time to make the main characters younger.   If not full foreshadowing, Whis&#39;s warning could be something that Toriyama recovered and used as the premise for DAIMA.   The possibility of a conspiracy linked to the time axis being thrown off could explain why characters in DAIMA revert to children.

## Literature Review

The Angel Whis from Dragon Ball Super could be the connection that explains the premise of the upcoming Dragon Ball DAIMA.




Not much is known about Akira Toriyama&#39;s upcoming all-new adventure Dragon Ball Daima except that Goku and the main characters have reverted to children, but a minor comment from the angel Whis in Dragon Ball Super suggests how the two series could be connected.




Fans first learned about Dragon Ball DAIMA with an official trailer shown at New York Comic-Con 2023. It is still unknown if this new series will take place in the main Dragon Ball timeline, at what point, and what could be its connection, if any, with the ongoing Dragon Ball Super. Although Akira Toriyama himself revealed that Goku and his friends turn small &#34;due to a conspiracy,&#34; some scrupulous fans may have also remembered something that Whis said in Dragon Ball Super chapter #14 by Toriyama and artist Toyotarou.

          

Whis revealed that the three-second reset he performed during the events of Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#39;F&#39; couldn&#39;t be performed so soon because it would &#34;throw off the time axis.&#34; As fans recall, Frieza had successfully destroyed the Earth right before Vegeta was about to kill him in &#39;F&#39;. Since Whis can&#39;t change the past or get involved in fights, his solution was to reset everything to moments before the Earth was destroyed. And, of course, Goku saves the day instead of Vegeta.





 Reversing Time and Dragon Ball DAIMA&#39;s Premise Are Naturally Connected 
          

Critics of this theory will undoubtedly point to the fact that Whis&#39; comment happened a long before DAIMA was announced, and it was likely just Toriyama&#39;s way of addressing the potential plot hole where Whis could just reset everything every time Goku and his friends ever lost. This is similar to how Toriyama reintroduced zenkai boosts in Super but made sure they would not have a detrimental influence on the plot. However, it would still be possible that this whole concept of reversing time was, if not straight-up foreshadowing, something that Toriyama recovered and used as the premise for Dragon Ball DAIMA.

What &#34;throwing off the time axis&#34; could entail is endless, and obviously reversing time, as Whis did in Resurrection of F, could also be used to revert adults&#39; bodies to an earlier point in time, as it happens in Dragon Ball DAIMA. Of course, Toriyama mentioned that these characters turn small because of a conspiracy. For this theory to work, the conspiracy would have to be somehow linked to the time axis being thrown off, which Super already made a possibility. This is entirely plausible since the supposed villains who appear in the trailer share a resemblance to angelic and godlike entities like Whis and even Grand Zeno, the Omni-King.






 Dragon Ball Has Already Linked Two Separate Series Together 
          

Past precedent dictates that Akira Toriyama could link the events of a new spin-off series like DAIMA to Dragon Ball. For example, Super brings back Dragon Ball&#39;s most famous villain, Frieza, and it even made Broly, a character from the Dragon Ball Z movies, canon. The Red Ribbon Army and a version of Cell come back in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero and its manga adaptation. Thus, it&#39;s a concrete possibility that Dragon Ball DAIMA will not be a completely separate spinoff but have at least some connection with Dragon Ball Super, and Whis&#39;s warning about messing with the time axis could explain it.

Dragon Ball Daima will debut in 2024.
