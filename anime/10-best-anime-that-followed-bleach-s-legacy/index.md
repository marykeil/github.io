## Literature Review

As a member of the &#34;Big 3&#34; of anime, Bleach has created an incredible legacy, and there are 10 anime that do the best job of following it.




Along with the other “Big 3” shonen anime and manga, One Piece and Naruto, Bleach has left an undeniable impact on the medium. Its stylized art and action, combined with more serious writing compared to some of its contemporaries, made it one of the biggest anime of its time, and seeing it return with Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has done wonders to revitalize the franchise.
It’s hard to see Bleach as anything other than one of the biggest anime franchises of all time, and it’s served as inspiration for its fair share of stories, that followed. Some anime utilize action, storytelling, and character designs that are clearly reminiscent of Bleach, and that’s especially true for any show with the basic premise of characters with spiritual powers fighting demonic creatures of some sort.
        

For some anime, the inspiration isn’t even accidental, as Bleach has been explicitly mentioned as an inspiration for many high-profile anime, and overall, it’s interesting to note just how big of an impact Bleach has managed to have on its industry.
            
 
 Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 Announced Alongside Release Window 
Right after the dramatic finale of the second season of Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War, part 3 has been announced.












 








 10  Fire Force Captures The Core Of Bleach’s Aesthetic 
Produced by David Production, based on the manga by Atsushi Okubo.
        

  Release Year   2019    Number Of Episodes   48    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
The first notable anime to follow Bleach’s legacy is Atsushi Ohkubo’s Fire Force. In addition to being another anime about people with supernatural powers fighting against demonic creatures, Fire Force’s stylish action and character designs are highly reminiscent of Bleach’s signature style, and the fact that that could be seen as far back as Soul Eater helps sell that point even better. The collected volumes of the manga even use Bleach’s gimmick of characters against a white background with the volume title spread across the entire cover, and it all comes together to make a series that greatly follows Bleach, intentional or otherwise.

 9  Noragami Adds A New Twist To Bleach’s Premise 
Produced by Studio Bones, based on the manga by Adachitoka.
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   25    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
Another anime that excels at utilizing Bleach’s aesthetic is Adachitoka’s Noragami. Noragami has the same basic premise as Bleach with characters using their spiritual powers to help the innocent, but in a unique twist, Noragami expands on and incorporates Japanese culture and mythology to a far greater degree than Bleach did. It also inverts Bleach’s gender roles by making the female protagonist the human with spiritual powers and the male protagonist the spiritual being in need of help, and with the story having a romance develop between them, it does a lot to stand out as its own thing while still managing to build on what made Bleach work.

 8  Durarara!! Modernizes Bleach’s Storytelling Strengths 
Produced by Brains&#39; Base &amp; Shuka, based on the light novels by Ryōgo Narita and Suzuhito Yasuda.


 







  Release Year   2010    Number Of Episodes   60    Where To Watch It   Funimation, Hulu    
Oftentimes, it’s the specific way in which a story is written that leaves the biggest impression, and when it comes to Bleach, that definitely happened with Ryogo Narita’s Durarara!! Durarara!!’s focus on character-driven stories within a supernatural world captures the core of Bleach’s strength, and the fact that it sticks to an urban fantasy setting, which is what Bleach started as, makes that comparison all the more palpable. Narita has even written two official Bleach novels, Spirits Are Forever With You and Can’t Fear Your Own World, so it&#39;s clear that he’s a writer who does a great job of emulating Bleach’s style both in and out of Durarara!!

 7  Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku Takes Bleach’s Dark Action Even Further 
Produced by Studio MAPPA, based on the manga by Yuji Kaku.
        

  Release Year   2023    Number Of Episodes   13    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll    
One of the trademarks of Bleach has always been its penchant for dark action and imagery, and an anime that does a great job of keeping to that idea is Yuji Kaku’s Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku. The dark and often gruesome imagery in Hell’s Paradise, whether it’s through gore or the grotesque designs of the villains, is highly reminiscent of Bleach’s art style, and it’s easy enough to see it as a natural evolution of Tite Kubo’s work. Add in the stylish action and simple, yet engaging, power system, and Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku does a great job of following the darker aspects of Bleach’s story.

 6  Dark Gathering’s Horror Elements Make Bleach Look Tame 
Produced by OLM, based on the manga by Kenichi Kondo.


 







  Release Year   2023    Number Of Episodes   24    Where To Watch It   HIDIVE    
Another anime that does a great job of emulating Bleach’s penchant for dark imagery is Kenichi Kondo’s Dark Gathering. Dark Gathering is another story of a character with spiritual powers battling demonic creatures, and the horrific imagery that accompanies every battle is some of the most gruesome and unsettling to ever be featured in a shonen series, and that, in turn, takes Bleach’s dark aesthetic to heights the original series could only dream of. Add in the creativity of said battles, and Dark Gathering does a great job of living up to Bleach’s legacy as a dark action series, despite how relatively new it is.

 5  Chainsaw Man Elevates Bleach’s Premise To New Heights 
Produced by Studio MAPPA, based on the manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto.
        

  Release Year   2022    Number Of Episodes   12    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Another anime that greatly follows Bleach’s legacy, despite how relatively new it might be, is Tatsuki Fujimoto’s Chainsaw Man. Like Bleach, Chainsaw Man’s basic premise is that of a boy being gifted supernatural powers to fight demonic creatures, and that’s used to create action scenes with a level of gravitas and stylistic flair that are reminiscent of Bleach in the best of ways. More than that, however, the character writing and use of quiet moments to build tension or calm is the exact sort of writing Bleach is known for, so it’s easy to see how the two could end up overlapping with one another.

 4  Blue Exorcist Puts A Modern Spin On Bleach’s World 
Produced by A-1 Pictures, based on the manga by Kazue Kato.
        

  Release Year   2011    Number Of Episodes   37    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Bleach became popular partly because of how it stood out from other shonen anime, but a series that does a great job of modernizing its basic concept is Kazue Kato’s Blue Exorcist. Blue Exorcist follows Bleach’s premise of people with spiritual powers having to protect the world from demonic creatures, but it also adds in some of the more modern staples of shonen anime like a school and more typical archetypes of the cast. That allows for Bleach’s work to be viewed through something of a modern lens, and after almost 15 years, Blue Exorcist has done wonders to show how that would work.

 3  Black Clover Takes Bleach’s Aesthetic And Mixes It With Dragon Ball Z 
Produced by Studio Pierrot, based on the manga by Yuki Tabata.
        

  Release Year   2017    Number Of Episodes   170    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
There are some anime where Bleach has been explicitly stated to be an influence, and an anime that perfectly lives up to that is Yuki Tabata’s Black Clover. Tabata has spoken about Bleach being an influence in the past, and it’s easy to see that with how much Asta takes after Ichigo with his demonic powers and giant sword, even adopting a dual-wielding fighting style just like Ichigo does. All of that is mixed in with action and character writing that takes heavy cues from Dragon Ball, and the result is a series that uses Bleach’s foundations to craft a story that more than lives up to its inspirations.

 2  Demon Slayer Takes Bleach’s Influence To Incredible Heights 
Produced by Ufotable, based on the manga by Koyoharu Gotouge.
        

  Release Year   2019    Number Of Episodes   55    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix    
Koyoharu Gotouge’s Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is another anime explicitly stated to be inspired by Bleach, and it shows that in tremendous fashion. Not only is Demon Slayer’s sword-based fighting against demons highly reminiscent of Bleach’s Soul Reapers fighting Hollows, with Demon Slayer even matching Bleach in visual flair, but Muzan and the Kizuki have an overall aesthetic that appears to be greatly inspired by Aizen and the Espada. Bleach’s influence on Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is hard to deny, and the fact that it’s gone on to become one of the biggest anime of all time speaks wonders to how effectively it was able to use that.

 1  Jujutsu Kaisen Is Bleach’s Truest Successor 
Produced by Studio MAPPA, based on the manga by Akutami Gege.


 







  Release Year   2020    Number Of Episodes   47    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Funimation    
The last anime to follow Bleach’s legacy, and probably the one to do so the most effectively, is Gege Akutami’s Jujutsu Kaisen. Like Black Clover and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen was explicitly stated to be inspired by Bleach, and with how much overlap characters like Yuji, Gojo, and Kenjaku have with Ichigo, Urahara, and Aizen, that’s more than easy to see. Add in how effectively the series utilizes dark action and stylish character designs, and Jujutsu Kaisen is likely the anime that does the best job of living up to Bleach’s storied legacy as one of the biggest anime of all time.
