 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

For Pokémon Horizons, new episodes are currently airing only in Japan, on the network TVTokyo. New episodes debut on Fridays at 6:55 PM JST, which converts to 2:55 AM Western Time and 5:55 AM Eastern Time, a time that&#39;s highly inconvenient for most would-be American viewers. The episodes, being intended for a Japanese audience, are also presented without subtitles, so knowledge of the Japanese Language would be essential to understanding the dialog. Pokémon Horizons will be receiving an English dub, currently set to debut in late 2023, but with no more specific date available at this time.



 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #26? 
          




Episode #26 of Pokémon Horizons was a bit of a breather episode, following on from the climactic confrontation between the Explorers and the Rising Volt Tacklers in episode #25. It focused on Liko getting to know Terapagos, as the Pokémon proved to be very curious about the world around it. Terapagos nearly got into trouble, climbing out onto a dangerous part of the ship and forcing Liko to retrieve it. Liko nearly fell, but her grandmother saved her and Terapagos. Liko&#39;s grandmother shared a few new details from Lucius&#39;s journal as well, showing Liko a picture of Terapagos&#39; other form.



 Pokémon Horizons Episode #27 Visits Galar&#39;s Wild Area 
          

Now on a mission to find the other members of the Six Heroes, Lucius&#39;s Pokémon, the team has decided to start with Black Rayquaza, which was last spotted in the Galar region. It seems the entire team will be disembarking from the airship for a solid lunch of curry, a very popular food in the Galar region. This looks to be another breather episode, focused more on the day-to-day life for the Rising Volt Tacklers and getting acquainted still with Terapagos. From the preview, it also seems that the story will be checking back in with the Explorers after their failed attempt to steal Terapagos, giving a clue as to their next move.




These slice-of-life style episodes may be different from the more plot-focused episodes, but they&#39;re still being presented with a solid level of quality that Pokémon Horizons has continued to demonstrate. They&#39;re akin to the sort of adventures that Ash would get up to between gyms, so there&#39;s a warm familiarity to them that should satisfy fans of the classic Pokémon anime. With the villains potentially on the move again, though, this peaceful period may not last for too long. Pokémon Horizons has struck a good balance between its story and plot and the slower-paced slice-of-life episodes, and it seems that trend will only be continuing into episode #27.
