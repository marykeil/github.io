 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 6? 
          




In Undead Unluck episode #6, “Spoil”, Fuko, Andy, and Shen traveled to America after narrowing down Spoil’s location to Longing, a Western town whose inhabitants have all been turned into zombies by Spoil. Despite how scared she feels about having to deal with zombies, Fuko is nonetheless determined to complete the quest because it will help them find the Negator with Unrepair, and assuming that they can create unfixable wounds, they could be the key to letting Andy die. Shen, however, is only interested in one thing: getting a chance to meet another side of Andy called Victhor, the God of victory.

                  Shonen Jump&#39;s Most Underrated Manga Completely Reinvents Power Systems   Chapter 152 of Undead Unluck adds a whole other dynamic to an already innovative power system that leaves many others like it in the dust.   

After arriving in Longing, Fuko and Shen encounter a group of children who have been living in hiding from the zombies, and despite the risk it imposed, Fuko tenderly embraced one of the children and put herself in the range for the zombification process to begin and show the children that she’s on their side. Meanwhile, Andy, now in a partially zombified state, followed a zombie who said she could bring him to Spoil if he married her. Andy went along with her, and after she asked Andy to put them all out of their misery, Andy began fighting Spoil with all the zombies in Longing rallied behind him.






 Undead Unluck Introduces The Anime’s Main Villains 
          

With Undead Unluck episode #6, the series has now established its main villains: the UMAs. While the Negators use their powers to negate the rules of the world, the UMAs are the living embodiment of those rules, thus making them the natural enemies of Fuko, Andy, and the other Negators of the Union. By fighting against UMAs, every fight directly brings out the idea of the characters having to fight against the arbitrary and dangerous rules God imposes on the world, and it will be great to see how far Undead Unluck episode #7 and beyond decide to go with that idea.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #7 when it releases on November 17.
