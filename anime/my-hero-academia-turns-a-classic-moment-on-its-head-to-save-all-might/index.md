## Literature Review

My Hero Academia flips one of its most iconic scenes in order for the students to save All Might from a very grisly death.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia, Chapter #404With All Might&#39;s fate on the line, My Hero Academia lays it all on the shoulders of Bakugo, who proceeds with an epic rescue plan that&#39;s a perfect echo of one of the series&#39; most exciting moments. Better still, the scene hearkens back to a different era of Bakugo to really show how far he&#39;s come.




Chapter #404 of My Hero Academia sees Bakugo return properly after the reveal that he was back up in last week&#39;s chapter. Recognizing the danger that All Might is in, Bakugo begins rocketing towards Deku, who takes his hand and makes use of the Second One for All User&#39;s Quirk, Gear Shift, to alter his momentum in midair and launch him in the direction of All Might.

          

Bakugo snatches All Might from All for One&#39;s hands, ripping his arms off in the process, and bolts away with a stunned All Might in tow. The sequence of events might sound a little familiar to fans, as that&#39;s almost exactly how Bakugo himself was saved during the Hideout Raid arc.


 Bakugo&#39;s Rescue of All Might Mirrors His Own 
          




Way back in chapter 90, when Bakugo was being held by the League of Villains, some of the other students, including Deku, formed a plan to rescue Bakugo and get him out of the way of All Might and All for One&#39;s battle. Todoroki created a ramp of ice, while Ida launched them into the air. Midoriya knew Bakugo wouldn&#39;t accept his help, and instead they had Kirishima reach out. Bakugo took his hand, and the kids dragged him out of danger as they flew off at high speeds. The midair rescue bears more than a passing resemblance to All Might&#39;s rescue here, with one key difference.

While at the time, Bakugo might have refused help from Deku, here, he turns to Deku for help first, reaching out for his hand in exactly the same way that he had reached for Kirishima&#39;s. It proves how far Bakugo has come that he&#39;s willing to work together with Deku like this, and that now their connection is so strong that no words need be said for them to be on the same page. Bakugo and Deku are able to perform some truly incredible feats when they work together, and here, the power of their shared desire to save All Might is even enough to overcome Sir Nighteye&#39;s vision of the future, and change All Might&#39;s fate.






 Bakugo&#39;s Ultimate Moment Makes Him a Hero in His Own Eyes 
          

Bakugo, who has long felt his kidnapping and rescue that night was the reason All Might lost his powers for good, is finally able to repay All Might, saving him from All for One in a similar manner. With that debt repaid, there&#39;s actually a weight lifted from Bakugo&#39;s shoulders, a burden he&#39;s been carrying for over 300 chapters now. While they still need to get All Might to a place of relative safety, he&#39;s out of immediate danger, and All for One has suffered another blow that will cause him to de-age even further. Bakugo&#39;s return to My Hero Academia has been a rousing success, and it makes for the perfect mirror to his lowest moment, finally redeeming him, if only to himself.
