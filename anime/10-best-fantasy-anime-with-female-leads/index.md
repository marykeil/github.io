## Literature Review

From iconic series to underrated cult classics that deserve more attention, here are the ten most unmissable female-led fantasy anime.





Here, then, are 10 female-led fantasy anime that any fan looking for more representation needs to seek out. The list includes some all-time classics and some hidden gems, hopefully offering a new recommendation whether you&#39;re a newcomer to fantasy anime or a longtime fan.









 








 10  Frieren 
        

Frieren takes place in the aftermath of a Lord of the Rings-like epic, in which a group of warriors spent ten years battling the Demon King and saving the world by each other&#39;s sides. However, decades later, the mortal members of the party have aged, while the titular elf hasn&#39;t. The anime explores Frieren&#39;s unique understanding of time, mortality, and knowledge, all from the perspective of an ageless being who only really experiences the passage of time by how it changes the world around her. While only a few episodes in, the anime is adapted from a solid manga, and Frieren is a fascinating character, through whose eyes fantasy tropes take on an entirely new meaning.





 9  Little Witch Academia 
        

While not a Magical Girl anime in terms of genre, this story does literally follow a group of magic girls. Little Witch Academia sees eager but magically inept Akko enroll at the witch school Luna Nova to follow in the footsteps of her idol, the famous witch Shiny Chariot. As Akko learns magic, she makes up for her abject lack of ability with sheer determination and sincerity in her love of magic. While there is an overarching storyline with the fate of the entire magical world at stake, Little Witch Academia is primarily a comedic look at everyday life in a magical setting. With the exception of a few male supporting characters, the entire cast is female, consisting mainly of the girls attending Luna Nova. Standout characters include a fish in a witch&#39;s hat who serves as Luna Nova&#39;s professor of Philosophy.





 8  Miss Kobayashi&#39;s Dragon Maid 
        

The story of Miss Kobayashi&#39;s Dragon Maid begins with a dramatic Reverse Isekai twist. The Dragon Tohru arrives on the doorstep of unassuming office worker Kobayashi and adopts human form. After a hungover Kobayashi invites the Dragon to stay with her, she finds her painfully mundane existence upended by a grateful Tohru proclaiming herself Kobayashi&#39;s new maid. The humor of the series is driven by the everyday banality of Kobayashi&#39;s life being contrasted with the fantastical nature of the Dragon characters. The cast is almost entirely female, and their interactions are the main appeal of the series.





 7  Don&#39;t Hurt Me, My Healer 
        

The title of the fantasy parody series is a request from the series&#39; male lead, the bumbling novice adventurer Alvin, to the female lead, the Dark Elf healer Carla. Carla is the more prominent of the two, not least because the curse she accidentally puts on Alvin will kill him if he&#39;s ever too far away from her. The two make a hapless pair, as Alvin proves himself inept at adventuring and constantly needs Carla&#39;s help - only to be plunged into even deeper trouble. The series&#39; deadpan humor is perfectly preserved in the English dub - a notable accomplishment, given it&#39;s where much of the joy of the anime comes from.
            
 
 20 Great Anime Featuring Strong Female Protagonists 
From classics like Ghost In The Shell to the more recent Fate or Violet Evergarden, these anime are all about the strong female leads. 








 6  Yashahime: Princess-Half Demon 
        

A sequel series to the beloved and iconic Inuyahsa, Yashahime picks up about fifteen years after the original series to follow the adventures of Towa and Setsuna, the daughters of Sesshomaru, and their cousin Moroha. Although original author Rumiko Takahashi had minimal involvement with the sequel series, Yashahime captures the tone and visual style of the original Inuyasha. The general consensus is that it&#39;s not as good as the original, though many fans were actually soured by story revelations bridging the gap between this and Inuyahsa. Taken by itself, Yashahime is compelling enough to stand on its own merits.





 5  The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated 
        

With the fall of the Dark Realm at the hands of a crusading Magical Girl character, demonic second-in-command Jahy has been banished to Earth. And without Mana Crystals to maintain her power, she&#39;s stuck in a childlike form and forced to work as a waitress to pay the bills incurred by mundane life in the real world. Ostensibly, Jahy is committed to taking over the world and restoring the Dark Realm. Most of the time, though, she&#39;s too busy trying to pay rent and put food on the table. Jahy&#39;s supervillain personality is hilariously out of place in such a mundane setting, but the series tells a relatable story of working a dead-end job to make ends meet. Although Jahy never really renounces evil, she does get plenty of growth as she warms up to the two sisters Boss and Landlord, her former minion from the Dark Realm, and the little girl from the neighborhood who helps her look for Mana Crystals.





 4  Slayers 
        

Existing at the midway point between parody and a sincere fantasy story with a clear Dungeons &amp; Dragons influence, Slayers is a comedy series telling the story of the sorceress Lina Inverse and her companions. Slayers is a fantasy romp with a cast full of ridiculous characters who are nevertheless capable of saving the world. There are moments of genuine tension, but for the most part it&#39;s a lighthearted, self-aware comedy. Lina is indisputably the main character, and the original light novels that are the basis of the anime series were recently translated into English for the first time.





 3  Claymore 
        

Claymore echoes Attack on Titan with its premise - a fantasy-medieval society attempts to survive on an island populated by cannibalistic monsters, with only a cadre of highly trained warriors (the Claymores of the title) to protect them. Packed with (literally) empowered female heroes, Claymore has a controversial ending, but it spends its time digging deep into the perspectives of its half-monster heroines, and serves up peerless action that&#39;s often treated as the sole province of male heroes. It also engages with the idea of personal versus social power - the Claymores may be deadly warriors, but they fight in service of a society run by men.
            
 
 12 Best Female Anime Characters of All Time, Ranked 
Anime is filled with a plethora of great female characters, but the following 12 are some of the best-written women in all anime history.








 2  The Vision of Escaflowne 
        

Something of a cult classic, due in part to never airing in its entirety in the United States when it was first localized into English, The Vision of Escaflowne is one of the best anime of the 1990s. Fundamentally an Isekai romance story, The Vision of Escaflowne sees high school student Hitomi transported to the world of Gaea, where she meets Van, the prince of the fallen kingdom of Fanelia and pilot of Escaflowne, a transforming mecha powered by the heart of a dragon. Despite being a romance story at its core, Escaflowne features intense mecha combat fight scenes with graphic human casualties, which played a major factor in the series being pulled from the air in the United States.





 1  Sailor Moon 
        

The most iconic and influential Magical Girl series of all time, Sailor Moon is the iconic model for female-led fantasy anime. Sailor Moon has been consistently popular for decades and the Sailor Guardians are among the most recognizable teams of heroes not just in anime, but pop culture in general. The Sailors are an all-female team who work together, support each other in a crisis, and bring out the best in one another, while showcasing an awesome power fantasy that&#39;s been oft-repeated, but never bettered.
Fans may have to search out female-led fantasy anime, but once they do, there&#39;s a treasure trove of awesome stories just waiting to be found, often built around the strong relationships and impressive agency of women and girls.
