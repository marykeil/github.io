## Literature Review

Streaming breathes new life into a cult classic of supernatural mysteries with the perfect companion series to watch after Demon Slayer.





Mononoke shouldn&#39;t be confused with Studio Ghibli classic Princess Mononoke – for context, &#34;mononoke&#34; is a catch-all term for a supernatural being or spirit. The series first aired in Japan in 2007. It was never officially released in North America, but earlier in 2023, it was given a Blu-ray release, including an all-new English dub by Discotek Media and is currently available on Netflix. Additionally, a feature-length Mononoke film is scheduled to release in Japan in 2023. This is the perfect opportunity to experience this masterpiece of the bizarre and beautiful. Mononoke perfectly blends horror, mystery, and historical fiction into a must-see series that both sets itself apart from, but also nicely compliments Demon Slayer with its different approach to its historical setting.





 Mononoke Is a Beautiful Nightmare 
        Mononoke/Netflix   

The tone of Mononoke is set in the very first scene, and it is clear that both Mononoke and Demon Slayer have put great care into their art direction, and both take cues from traditional Japanese visual art and theater. Mononoke begins with a traditional Japanese sliding door opening to reveal a rainy night drawn to look like a moving painting. The strangely dressed Medicine Seller follows a lone woman into an inn. As the night passes, the spirits haunting the inn make themselves known and the Medicine Seller slowly unveils the dark history of the inn. In order to exorcise the mononoke, the Medicine Seller must reveal their Shape, Truth, and Reason: their physical form, their goals, and the cause of their manifestation as evil spirits.

As a horror series, Mononoke is rarely overtly scary. Instead of relying on jump scares, the series builds up the psychological horror by creating a constant sense of slowly simmering tension and genuine dread. Although beautiful, the art is so thoroughly stylized ad unrelentingly bizarre that everything looks off: dizzying, constantly moving colors and patterns, constant jarring camera cuts, background characters reduced to literally faceless crowds, main characters drawn and animated in a deliberately uncanny manner. Perhaps most horrifying of all, every mononoke in the series is ultimately created of negative human emotions – in the end, humanity is the real evil.




Depsite its short runtime, Mononoke demands both an attentive eye while watching. The beautiful animation is deliberately confusing and there is no real way to tell if the viewers and the characters are even seeing the same things. Certain foreshadowing is only apparent with the benefit of hindsight, but even with that hindsight and even with multiple watches of the series, some of the mysteries don&#39;t get answers. The Medicine Seller himself remains a mystery, clearly more than human despite his frequent claims to be no more than a simple merchant.

Undeniably a masterpiece of art direction and psychological horror, Mononoke is now easier than ever to watch thanks to its Netflix release. The series sets itself apart from other mystery series with its historical setting, while standing out from other historical fiction with its atmosphere of supernatural horror. Through the strength of both its similarities and differences, Mononoke is the perfect watch to compliment Demon Slayer.

Mononoke is available to stream on Netflix.
