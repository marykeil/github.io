## Literature Review

One major criticism of The Rising of the Shield Hero has been the handling of Raphtalia&#39;s character, but season 3 is trying to fix it.





Raphtalia has definitely gotten the short end of the stick in terms of development, but The Rising of the Shield Hero season 3, episode #2 provides a perfect chance to fix that. Episode #2, &#34;Nadia&#34;, saw Naofumi, Raphtalia, and Filo being matched against Nadia, and through their fight, there are revelations about Nadia that tie heavily into Raphtalia&#39;s character in a way that&#39;s independent of her relationship with Naofumi.




          

By building off that, Shield Hero can develop Raphtalia in a way that doesn&#39;t focus on her relationship with Naofumi, and both Raphtalia and the overall narrative of the series would be stronger because of it.

                  &#34;A Return To Form&#34;: Rising of the Shield Hero Season 3 Fixes Season 2&#39;s Disappointment   The Rising of the Shield Hero season 2 was met with largely negative reception, but season 3 episode #1 appears to be putting things back on track.   


 Rising of the Shield Hero&#39;s New Character Can Bring Raphtalia Back To Her Roots 
          

The reason why Nadia can be so important for Raphtalia&#39;s development in The Rising of the Shield Hero season 3 is because of how she can bring Raphtalia back to her roots. Episode #2 revealed that Nadia&#39;s true identity is Sadeena, a demihuman from Raphtalia&#39;s village whom Raphtalia saw as a sister, so their dynamic can return focus back to tragedies Raphtalia had to endure and how much she and the other villagers have changed because of them. Something like that could offer some well-needed introspection for Raphtalia&#39;s character, and since it wouldn&#39;t automatically have to go back to Naofumi, it would be even better, as a result.

 Why Naofumi &amp; Raphtalia&#39;s Relationship Is A Problem 
          

Sadeena&#39;s presence can do a lot to fix how Raphtalia has been handled in her relationship with Naofumi, and that begs the question of why it&#39;s an issue to begin with. While the fact that Raphtalia is technically Naofumi&#39;s &#34;slave&#34; - bound to him by a magical contract - is controversial to begin with, the real problem is that too much of Raphtalia&#39;s character is focused on her feelings for Naofumi, something that became especially true after she got revenge against her previous master in season 1 and was left without an arc for the rest of the season. It made one of the more interesting characters in The Rising of the Shield Hero boring to watch, and very little was done to justify it.




                  15 Best Isekai Anime You Should Watch Right Now   Even with the oversaturation of the genre, there are still plenty of excellent isekai anime shows worth streaming in the summer of 2023.   

That sort of issue is unfortunately common in not just anime and manga, but fiction in general, as stories will often struggle to give certain characters any meaningful parts to play beyond being the love interest of the protagonist. It&#39;s hardly a universal occurrence, of course, and by using Raphtalia&#39;s relationship with Sadeena to develop her in a way independent of Naofumi, The Rising of the Shield Hero season 3 can do a lot to bring Raphtalia away from that clichÃ©. There&#39;s still no way to know if that&#39;s going to happen, but the series would certainly be all the better for it if it did.

The Rising of the Shield Hero Season 3 releases new episodes Fridays on Crunchyroll.
