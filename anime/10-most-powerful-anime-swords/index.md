## Literature Review

Legendary swords that stand out above other fictional weapons and have earned their place as the iconic weapons of iconic heroes.





Samurai stories have had a major influence on anime, leading many anime heroes fight with a katana just like historical samurai. However, thanks to the large number of iconic fantasy anime, many other iconic anime swords are based on European-style swords or are purely works of the creator&#39;s imagination. Regardless of their exact form, the most powerful anime swords are instantly recognizable and featured in some of the most iconic anime sword fights of all time.









 








 10  Zantetsuken - Lupin III 
        

A descendant of the ninja who has gone down in history as Japan&#39;s Robin Hood, Goemon Ishikawa XIII is one of Lupin&#39;s major allies. Goemon plays a very crucial role in Lupin&#39;s gang. As he has boasted many, many times throughout the long-running Lupin III series, his sword Zantetsuken is capable of cutting through virtually anything, serving a very niche but very valuable role in Lupin&#39;s heists. Notably, Goemon very rarely actually hurts anyone with Zantetsuken despite its impressive cutting power, mainly cutting through inanimate obstacles to the gang&#39;s heists or subduing enemies by destroying their weapons or clothes to defeat them through sheer embarrassment.





 9  Zoro&#39;s Three Swords - One Piece 
        

Although the only sword Zoro is depicted with throughout the entire series is the white-hilted Wado Ichimonji, a weapon of immense sentimental importance to him, his fighting style revolves around using three swords at once. Zoro&#39;s three-sword style was introduced early in the series and is a perfect demonstration of One Piece&#39;s unique visual style and endless variation of memorable and diverse abilities of its characters. Using this style to decisively dispatch his opponents, Zoro himself quickly established himself as one of the strongest characters in the series and he, alongside the swords he wields, only grows stronger throughout One Piece.





 8  The Dragon Slayer - Berserk 
        

Introduced all the way back in 1989, Guts&#39;s enormous sword the Dragon Slayer has become an iconic part of his character. Over the decades, Guts has used the Dragon Slayer to destroy monsters, demons, Apostles, and even malevolent gods in spectacular fashion. In a recent fight scene in the Berserk manga, Guts used the Dragon Slayer to cut one hair from the godlike Griffith&#39;s head. While this is a minor thing, it proves that Griffith isn&#39;t quite as invincible as he seems and that Guts may have the means to finally defeat him. Unlike many of the other strongest anime swords that require finesse and technique, the Dragon Slayer&#39;s strength as a blade is almost entirely due to its massive size.





 7  Van&#39;s Sword - Gun x Sword 
        

In battle, Van&#39;s sword is able to switch between a flexible, whip-like form and a standard cutting blade when exposed to an electrical current. Van uses his sword in several novel ways, using its flexible form like a grappling hook to travel distances quickly and spinning the blade fast enough to deflect oncoming bullets. The real potential of Van&#39;s sword, however, is unlocked when it is used to summon and control the powerful and awe-inspiring mech Dann, one of the seven strongest mechs on the planet of Endless Illusion. Fittingly, Dann enters battle being dropped from orbit in the shape of a giant sword.





 6  Tanjiro&#39;s Nichirin Sword - Demon Slayer 
        

The Nichirin Swords are the signature weapons of the Demon Slayer corps. A newly forged Nichirn blade changes color when drawn for the first time by its wielder, reflecting that Demon Slayer&#39;s particular aptitudes and abilities. In particular, a Nichirin Sword&#39;s color reflects an affinity with a particular Breathing Style. Although Tanjiro&#39;s black Nichirin Sword is initially considered unlucky, this is a superstition based on both the rarity of black Nichirin Swords and their exact nature being poorly understood. In fact, Tanjiro&#39;s Nichirin Sword turning black actually reflects that it is a very powerful sword. The Black Nichirin swords are associated with Sun Breathing, the powerful Breathing Style that was the first to be developed and from which all other Breathing Styles are derived.





 5  Teacher - Reincarnated as Sword 
        

 The identity of the human reincarnated into the sword in his new life as an isekai protagonist has never been revealed, so the sentient&#39;s sword only name is Teacher, given by Fran, the aspiring adventurer that the sword mentors. Before meeting Fran, Teacher was able to travel and level up on his own, like a typical RPG character. Before even meeting Fran, Teacher was able to gain levels and unlock several powerful techniques. In addition to his impressive RPG abilities, Teacher retains his human intellect, allowing him to aid Fran with both powerful techniques and helpful tactical guidance.





 4  The Sword of Salvation - Mononoke 
        

Mononoke&#39;s Sword of Salvation lives up to its name, with the mysterious Medicine Vendor of underrated horror classic Mononoke using the Sword to exorcise the malevolent spirits that give the series its title. In order to draw the sword, the Medicine Seller must discern the mononoke&#39;s Shape, Truth, and Reason: what it is, what it wants, and what caused it to become a mononoke. Mononoke is more a series about investigating evil spirits than fighting them. Once the Medicine Vendor is able to draw the Sword of Salvation, what follows can hardly be considered fights. Changing into a powerful second form, the Medicine Vendor rarely needs more than a single swing of the sword to exorcise the mononoke.





 3  The Sword of Light - Slayers 
        

The Sword of Light is established to be one of the most powerful weapons in the world of Slayers. Throughout the course of the series, the Sword of Light lives up to its reputation, cutting down powerful monsters with one blow. Of course, Slayers is a comedy series, so the twist of the premise of an immensely powerful holy weapon is that it&#39;s in the hands of the least competent character in the cast. Although Gourry is a capable swordsman, his naivety and general lack of intelligence is the source of much the series&#39; humor. This, combined with memorable female lead Lina Inverse&#39;s constant attempts to buy the Sword of Light from Gourry means that the sword is both one of the series&#39; most powerful important weapons and funniest running gags.





 2  Zangetsu - Bleach 
        

One of the defining aspects of the Bleach Universe is the Soul Reaper&#39;s Zanpakutō, sentient swords inhabited by spirits and possessing diverse impressive powers. Ichigo&#39;s Zanpakuto stands out as particularly noteworthy for a number of reasons. As a seemingly normal human, why Ichigo is even able to wield a Zanpakuto in the first place is an ongoing mystery and Ichigo&#39;s growth in power to unlock more of his weapon&#39;s powers and to better master the tempestuous spirit inhabiting the weapon drives much of Ichigo&#39;s character development. As Ichigo becomes increasingly able to rein in Zangetsu&#39;s full power and unlock its potential, he becomes consistently one of the strongest individual characters in Bleach.





 1  Tessaiga &amp; Tenseiga - Inuyasha 
        

The two swords bestowed by the Dog Demon Toga to his sons Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, Tessaiga &amp; Tenseiga are two of the most powerful objects in the series making them two of the most powerful swords in anime history, just like the Inuyasha series itself has become a beloved icon of anime. While Tessaiga allows Inuyasha to unlock more and more powerful combat techniques, Tenseiga itself drives much of Sesshomaru&#39;s character development. Although initially contemptuous of his father&#39;s gift and envious of his brother&#39;s seemingly much more powerful weapon, as Sesshomaru learns more about the healing powers of Tenseiga and learns to wield them, Sesshomaru develops more empathy and compassion, gradually shifting from a complete villain to a more heroic character who may never be entirely virtuous, but at least comes to care fiercely for his loved ones.
For as long as stories have existed, swords have become synonymous with fictional heroes, and many anime characters over the years have used swords. Of all the swords ever wielded by anime heroes, a handful clearly stand out above all the others thanks to their memorable visual design and sheer strength. These legendary blades have created some iconic moments. The most powerful swords in anime history are all incredible weapons that are complete game changers when wielded.
