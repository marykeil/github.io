## Literature Review

Under is the main group of Negators opposing the Union in Undead Unluck, and this is a breakdown of all of their powers and abilities in the series.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Undead Unluck!!The superpowers in Undead Unluck primarily revolve around the living manifestations of Rules and the Negators who negate their abilities. Many of the Negators in Undead Unluck are members of the Union, a secret organization that routinely takes on quests from the Artifact Apocalypse to gradually build up enough power to defeat God and free the world from his arbitrary Rules.
One of the main forces opposing Undead Unluck&#39;s Union, however, is the organization known as Under, originally known as Negator Hunters. While the Union works to protect the world, the members of Under fight largely for selfish reasons, many of them not even caring about God, and prioritize the well-being of Negators over regular humans, and even then, they have no qualms with killing Negators whom they deem worthless.
        

Under was the source of a lot of Undead Unluck’s conflict for a large part of the series, and their members appropriately have a lot of different abilities to discuss, Negator abilities or otherwise.

Chapter 152 of Undead Unluck adds a whole other dynamic to an already innovative power system that leaves many others like it in the dust.












 








 11  Billy Alfred 
The Union&#39;s Kindhearted Traitor


 







The Number One Negator in Under is Billy Alfred, who founded the organization while with the Union so his friends wouldn&#39;t have to die fighting God. While Billy’s Negator ability was initially believed to be Unbelievable, which allowed him to ricochet bullets at an inhuman level, Billy&#39;s true Negator ability is Unfair, which lets him copy the Negator ability of any Negator who hates him. In the 101st loop, however, the conditions for Billy&#39;s Unfair change so that he can copy someone&#39;s Negator ability by simply acknowledging their strength, and this leads to Billy fully committing himself to Fuuko&#39;s Union without starting Under in the 101st loop.

 10  Rip Tristan 
The Man Who Couldn&#39;t Become A Hero


 







The second-most prominent member of Under after Billy, who is considered Number Four Negator in the organization, is Rip Tristan. Rip&#39;s Negator ability, Unrepair, makes any injury he inflicts on someone impossible to heal so long as he&#39;s alive, and his legs have been replaced with the Artifact Blade Runner, a pair of mechanical legs capable of flight and shooting blades as projectiles. While Rip acts like a villain, he only does so for the sake of his goal of stealing the Ark to go back in time and stop himself from accidentally killing his fiancé, Leila, an accident Fuuko worked to prevent in the 101st loop.





 9  Latla Mirah 
Under&#39;s Failed Fortune Teller


 







After Billy and Rip, the next prominent member of Under is Latla Mirah, the Number Nine Negator of Under and one of Rip&#39;s two wives alongside her sister, Leila, in the 101st loop. While Latla&#39;s Negator ability was unnamed for a large portion of the series, the 101st loop revealed Latla&#39;s Negator ability to be Untrust, which warps reality so that the exact opposite of whatever prediction she makes is what ends up coming true. Additionally, while Latla was initially in a supporting role, in the 101st loop, she splits Blade Runner with Rip to join him as a fighter in the Union.





 8  Tella 
Billy&#39;s Second-In-Comand
        

Tella is the Number Two Negator of Under and Billy’s former partner from when they were in the mercenary group Horizon Balance. Tella&#39;s Negator ability is Untell, which prevents Tella from physical communication in any way, shape, or form, with Tella ironically gaining it as he tried to alert his allies to an ambush, but he&#39;s able to circumvent that restriction with special technology to project his thoughts through a speaker. Tella can also use Untell to create sound barriers to block attacks, with that ability stemming from how the kanji used to write Untell can also be read as things like &#34;stop&#34;, &#34;suspend&#34;, &#34;obstruct&#34;, or &#34;do not pass&#34;.





 7  Creed Deckard 
Under&#39;s Unflappable Lieutenant
        

Creed Deckard is the Number 3 Negator of Under and, just like Billy and Tella, was a former member of the mercenary group Horizon Balance. Creed&#39;s Negator ability is Undecrease, which prevents him from ever running out of ammunition for his weapons so long as he has ownership over them, whether it be a gun or something more esoteric like a bomb or a grenade. Naturally, Creed can’t fire his weapons indefinitely if the weapon, itself, is incapable of functioning properly, and if something happens to prevent his ammunition from being used up, then Undecrease won&#39;t be able to provide him with more until the problem is resolved.





 6  Yusai 
Andy&#39;s Swordsmanship Master
        

The Number Five Negator of Under is Yusai, an elderly swordswoman who was both Andy&#39;s former master and his former lover. Yusai&#39;s Negator ability is Undraw, which prevents her and anyone she targets with her ability from withdrawing things, although that drawback does little to damper her swordsmanship. When Yusai is recruited into Fuuko&#39;s Union in the 101st loop, she’s much younger than she was in the 100th loop, and not only has she never fallen in love with Andy due to the various changes in history, but due to her age, she has less control over Undraw than her older self in the previous loop did.





 5  Feng Kowloon 
The Strongest In All Creation
        

The Number Six Negator of Under is Feng Kowloon, Shen&#39;s master, adoptive father, and sworn enemy. In addition to being a master of the Shin Hakkyoku fighting style, Feng’s Negator ability, Unfade, prevents him from aging, although he didn&#39;t obtain it until after becoming an old man. In the 101st loop, however, Feng obtained Unfade while still young, and through a combination of his rivalry with Fuuko and being forced to have a more active part in raising Shen and Mei, Feng loses much of his bloodlust and becomes a nicer person and genuine ally to the Union in the 101st loop.





 4  Enjin Banba 
The Hardboiled Ramen Chef
        

The Number Seven Negator of Under is Enjin Banba, a hardboiled ramen chef who&#39;s mastered his craft with training from all around the world. Enjin&#39;s Negator ability is Unburn which, as the name implies, allows Enjin to negate burning and combustion, something that made him a vital player in the final fight against God, the living embodiment of the sun. Enjin didn&#39;t have a large part in the story during the 100th loop, but the 101st loop delved more into his character and had him be the key to letting the Union get into contact with Andy as he forms a living sunspot to hinder the Master Rules.





 3  Sadako Kurusu (Kururu) 
Under&#39;s Former Idol
        

The Number Eight Negator of Under is Sadako Kurusu, a former idol better known by her stage name Kururu. Kururu’s Negator ability is Unchaste, which makes anyone fall in love with her when she strikes a specific pose, but her ability doesn&#39;t work on anyone who either doesn&#39;t understand love or is already in love with someone else. Of all the members of Under, Kururu received the least amount of screentime and development in the 100th loop, and she was even the only one not involved in the fight with God, but the current arc is bound to flesh out her character.





 2  Backs (Bunny) 
Under&#39;s Most Enigmatic Member
        

The Number Ten Negator of Under is Backs, a little girl in a bunny suit who, very appropriately, is primarily referred to as Bunny. Bunny&#39;s Negator ability is Unback, which allows her to trap objects and people inside her suit, although that doesn&#39;t prevent her victims from attacking her, as shown when she tried to trap God with her ability. The finer details of Unback haven&#39;t been explored, and Bunny doesn&#39;t fully understand how it works, either.





 1  Sean Datz 
The Resident Side Character
        

The final Negator of Under is Sean Datz, a former actor turned gang member who was forced into Under by Rip. Sean&#39;s Negator ability is Unseen, which turns Sean invisible while his eyes are closed, and in the 101st loop, not only does he learn to extend that invisibility to other people he touches, but he becomes able to make his weight and body heat invisible to anything that could detect them, as well. Sean&#39;s character was never truly explored until the latter half of Undead Unluck, and with how effortlessly his character has been developed, other characters are bound to receive the same treatment as the story goes on.
