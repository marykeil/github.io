## Literature Review

2024 is already looking like a great year for anime, but Square Enix has added a new show to the list for fans of comedy-style anime.




Mai Tanaka&#39;s popular manga A Terrified Teacher at Ghoul School! was announced to be receiving an anime adaptation at some point in 2024, produced by Square Enix, which also publishes the manga series.




The news comes from a message from the author on the official website for the manga. This comedy story was made popular in Japan through its publishing in Square Enix&#39;s Monthly G Fantasy magazine. It was later made into individual Japanese manga volumes by Yen Press, who will also be creating the English version.


 A Terrified Teacher at Ghoul School! Is A Hit Supernatural Comedy 
          

                  Crunchyroll Debuts 2024&#39;s First Must-See Anime With New Romance Series   Crunchyroll is kicking off 2024 with a new romance anime, and it has potential to be one of their best as it becomes the year&#39;s first must-see series.   

A Terrified Teacher at Ghoul School! is a comedy manga that revolves around the events of a human teacher who ends up being assigned to teach at a school for ghouls. A human being surrounded by supernatural beings is not necessarily new, but the comedic value still holds up in modern storytelling. The official page to purchase the manga on Yen Press summarizes it as follows:





&#34;Rookie teacher Haruaki Abe is as cowardly as they come. It&#39;s hard enough for him to handle human students without whimpering-and now he&#39;s going to be teaching at a school full of monsters?! It&#39;s a classroom of horrors for Haruaki, as his mischievous students use every means at their disposal to prank him! Will this poor teacher be able to get his group of ghouls under control, or is this class destined for failure?&#34;


The premise of the manga and show is one that will appeal to fans of awkward comedy and main characters that are easily scared. While there will always be more action-based anime, it is nice to see other genres getting some much-deserved attention as well. It is uncertain where the anime adaptation of A Terrified Teacher at Ghoul School! will be available for viewing, but the show is bound to be a hit for comedy anime fans once it releases.
