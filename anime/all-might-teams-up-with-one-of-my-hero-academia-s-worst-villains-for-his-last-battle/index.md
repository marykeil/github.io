## Literature Review

Chapter 400 of My Hero Academia has All Might finding a new ally, although it&#39;s probably the last person he ever expected to fight alongside.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia, Chapter #400My Hero Academia returned to All Might&#39;s final battle, only to reveal that the former number one hero wasn&#39;t alone. Coming to his aid was none other than the Hero Killer, Stain, at a critical moment.




Chapter #400 of My Hero Academia showed All Might pinning down All for One with a massive blast of energy, desperate to keep the villain in place and continuously shot. It even seemed to be working well, as All for One has been reduced to a young child by his overpowered regeneration, inching him closer and closer to nonexistence. However, All Might&#39;s suit is beginning to malfunction from the damage and overuse, and techniques he was using to hold All for One in place were no longer an option. As All for One began to make his move, he suddenly found himself paralyzed, as Stain appeared, having slashed the villain and activated his Quirk.


 All Might and Stain Vs. All for One 
          

Stain&#39;s Quirk happened to be exactly what All Might needed, and now that All for One is unable to move, it should be significantly easier to defeat him. All for One has many tricks up his sleeve, though, and Stain&#39;s Quirk does have a time limit, which varies based on blood type. All for One may be able to overpower the paralysis, or use some combination of Quirks to free himself. Even in that event, though, it&#39;s now a two-versus-one fight, giving All for One something else to worry about besides All Might&#39;s attack. And best of all, Stain is only involved because of All for One&#39;s machinations to start with, making it a case of being hoist by his own petard.




All Might and Stain have a very interesting relationship; despite being the Hero Killer, Stain legitimately believes All Might to be a hero, and he would never want to see All Might fall to evil. Stain also has a very contentious relationship with the League of Villains, as they used him and discarded him once he was arrested. For Stain, this may well be the dream experience he&#39;s always longed for--battling alongside All Might to defeat those who are truly evil. All Might, for his part, at least knows that Stain fully understands his idea of being the Symbol of Peace, and even convinced All Might not to give up back when he was at his lowest.

While fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the Hero Killer certainly wasn&#39;t high on All Might&#39;s list, he really couldn&#39;t ask for a more steadfast and fanatically loyal ally in this battle, and he needs all the help he can get. Many fans have been waiting for Stain to make his appearance in the final war arc, as he was one of the few noteworthy characters who hadn&#39;t yet appeared. My Hero Academia saved his dramatic return for the perfect moment, and the Hero Killer has come through when no one else could.
