## Literature Review

There are many animated Pokémon movies which have been released over the franchise&#39;s 25 year run. Here&#39;s the proper order to watch them.





Unfortunately, the majority of these movies aren&#39;t easily available via subscription streaming services, except for the two most recent films. Instead, they&#39;ll have to be rented or purchased digitally if modern fans want to check out the movies. On the other hand, the films are largely available on most big digital media marketplaces, making them fairly easy to find for those who really want to check them out. Whether it&#39;s for nostalgia&#39;s sake or simply that Pokémon desire to see them all, here&#39;s how fans can track down and find all the various Pokémon movies that have been released over the years.

Suddenly, a break in the dimensions appears, and a battle breaks out between the Time Pokémon Dialga and the Space Pokémon Palkia, trapping the town in a pocket dimension.

  Release Year:   2008    How to Watch:   Available for rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play.    Runtime:   96 Minutes    
Giratina and the Sky Warrior is an interesting Pokémon film because it&#39;s something of a direct sequel to the previous film, Rise of Darkrai. Normally, Pokémon films are stand-alone stories, but these two (and the following film) form a trilogy. When Giratina&#39;s home, the Reverse World, is threatened, it seeks out vengeance on those it believes to be responsible: Dialga and Palkia. However, it happens to encounter Shaymin, the eponymous Sky Warrior, and thinks it might be involved as well.

  Release Year:   2009    How to Watch:   Available for rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play.    Runtime:   94 Minutes    
The third entry in the Diamond &amp; Pearl trilogy, Arceus and the Jewel of Life also involves Dialga and Palkia, as well as Giratina. Peace is finally brokered between the three raging Legendary Pokémon, but that&#39;s when Arceus, the &#34;God&#34; of all Pokémon, appears, swearing vengeance. Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina are no match for Arceus, even together, so Ash and his friends must go back in time to change the course of history and prevent Arceus from wreaking havoc. If they fail, the heroes may well be erased from history altogether, making the stakes some of the highest in any Pokémon film.





 Pokémon: Zoroark—Master of Illusions 
        

  Release Year:   2010    How to Watch:   Available for rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play.    Runtime:   95 Minutes

Different Pokémon appear in each version of the film, but the plots are otherwise identical. The movie revolves around a town where the People of the Vale live, where a battle between Zekrom and Reshiram took place 1,000 years ago, trapping Victini inside a barrier.

Still, as both Genesect and Mewtwo have been modified by humans, it attempts to reach out to the Red Genesect which leads the army, trying to convince it to go somewhere it can live peacefully. Their mistrust leads to further confrontation, however, until the entire city might be at risk. It&#39;s up to Ash to help Mewtwo stop the Genesect Army and protect the city.
