# Pokémon Made Superheroes Work in Anime Long Before My Hero Academia


## SUMMARY 



  The Pokémon anime features a variety of costumed superheroes and villains, who rely on their Pokémon to fight crime and save the day.   Some notable Pokémon-themed superheroes include Gligarman and Gligirl, Accelguard, and Blaziken Mask.   These heroes and villains add a unique twist to the Pokémon anime, combining elements of powered heroes and gadget-reliant fighters.

## Literature Review

Costumed supervillains and superheroes are surprisingly commonplace in the Pokémon world, giving them an anime presence well before My Hero Academia.




When one thinks of anime superheroes, the Pokémon anime probably isn&#39;t what comes to mind first, but in its 25-year run, the series saw plenty of costumed heroes (and villains) make an appearance. These heroes usually didn&#39;t have much power themselves, but with a Pokémon at their side, they may as well be super.




The first costumed superhero to appear in the Pokémon anime was &#34;Gligarman,&#34; a parody of Batman who is first introduced stopping Team Rocket in the episode &#34;The Superhero Secret.&#34; Gligarman keeps his secret identity (as &#34;Mr. Parker&#34; the toymaker) while performing vigilante activities with his own Gligar. Later in the episode, he&#39;s joined by &#34;Gligirl,&#34; who is actually his daughter who figured out his identity.

          

Entrusting the safety of the town to his daughter, Gligarman would hang up the cape by episode&#39;s end. Gligarman and Gligirl are far from the only Pokémon-themed superheroes, however.

An episode of Black &amp; White, &#34;The Mighty Accelguard to the Rescue!&#34; sees the eponymous superhero, Accelguard and his Pokémon Accelgor, going up against the criminal Cryogonal Man. Accelguard is a Kamen Rider-style hero located in Driftveil City of the Unova region, which is modeled on real-life New York City, the home of a great many superheroes in fiction. Cryogonal Man is a typical &#34;take over the world&#34; villain, with hare-brained schemes to boot. Accelguard teams up with Ash and the gang to help defeat him, and even ends up revealing his secret identity to them.

The most important superhero in Pokémon, however, is definitely Blaziken Mask. In Pokémon XY, Blaziken Mask makes his dramatic debut, saving Ash from what would surely be a fall to his death, using the power of his Mega Blaziken to move fast enough to help. Blaziken Mask ends up being a recurring character throughout XY, and is soon revealed to be the secret identity of Clemont and Bonnie&#39;s father, Meyer, an otherwise unassuming appliance store owner. Since Clemont and Bonnie are traveling with Ash, Blaziken Mask crosses their path almost any time they&#39;re in Lumiose City, even battling against the evil Team Flare alongside them.




The history of superheroes and villains in Pokémon goes back a long way, as is proven in &#34;Spinarak Attack,&#34; where a superthief known as the Black Arachnid had a legendary crime spree around a hundred years ago. Team Rocket even got in on the act, taking on the identity of Black Arachnid II in &#34;A Lean Mean Team Rocket Machine,&#34; even bringing the concept of a legacy character over. While Pokémon&#39;s superheroes and villains are a bit incidental to the main story, it&#39;s interesting that people would take on costumed identities in order to fight crime with no powers other than their Pokémon. It makes these heroes into a unique mix between powered heroes and those who rely on gadgets, giving the Pokémon anime a one-of-a-kind take on superheroes.

Pokémon XY can be streamed on Hulu.

Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers.
