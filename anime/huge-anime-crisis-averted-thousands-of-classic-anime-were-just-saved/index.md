## Literature Review

TOHO has announced a new archive company that will oversee the thousands of anime masters Tokyo Laboratory left after it shut down.




In an early Christmas present for proponents of media preservation, Tokyo Laboratory announced its thousands of anime master shots would be preserved. Despite fears of their destruction in light of the company&#39;s impending shutdown, it was announced that the newly formed TOHO Archive would now manage the material. This should be a relief for fans who saw the worrisome announcement months back.




Tokyo Laboratory was a subsidiary of TOHO that closed its doors at the end of November. One of its many responsibilities was the archiving of the many anime that passed through its doors. According to X user Nao Arakawa, Toho is securing all unclaimed anime that were previously held by Tokyo Laboratory;



&#34;This is an excerpt from the announcement from Tokyo Photo Studio that was released earlier.


[Notice of closure of all operations] Due to the closure of all operations of our company on November 30th (Thursday), we have ended the process of returning film originals from our company. Please note that original film copies whose rights holders cannot be confirmed will be managed by TOHO Archive Co., Ltd.&#34;





 

While the fate of these master reels was in question, TOHO&#39;s announcement of a dedicated archival department puts this lingering issue to rest.

 New TOHO Archive Will Keep Protecting Unclaimed Anime Masters 

 

The news broke in September that Tokyo Laboratory&#39;s closure put its repository of anime at risk of destruction. The film editing and development company managed thousands of physical reels unclaimed by other companies. In the wake of a restructuring aimed at transitioning towards digital film, Tokyo Labtoratory&#39;s duties were split up between new departments, but nothing was said regarding its archive, leading to many fearing the worst. If TOHO was unwilling to foot the bill and keep preserving the reels even when it switched over to digital, countless anime would be destroyed, never to see the light of day again.

The panic regarding the masters&#39; preservation even led to a post by politician Zenko Kurishita on his X account promising to intervene in the matter, assuring netizens that everyone was &#34;aware of the historical value of the film masters&#34;. Thankfully, news sources like AnimeNewsNetwork report that TOHO has created the TOHO Archive. This new company will take over the management of the unclaimed masters in the wake of Tokyo Laboratory&#39;s closure, showing that their destruction is clearly not on the table as far as the film giant is concerned. Questions still remain about what TOHO will ultimately do with these media, but at least they&#39;ll be preserved.




A cynical interpretation is that the can has only been kicked down the road, since nothing promises that TOHO Archive itself won&#39;t go the way of Tokyo Laboratory. The unclaimed masters ultimately are a monetary sink the company is holding onto on behalf of other parties. Still, given it was formed just this year, it is unlikely that TOHO will give up on media preservation tomorrow. For now, these anime will not be erased from history. This marks a victory for anime fans now that Tokyo Laboratory is confirmed to have closed gracefully, with all its issues neatly tied up.
