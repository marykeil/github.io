## Literature Review

Blurring the lines between Science Fiction and Fantasy, the Steampunk genre allows for some incredible creative possibilities in anime.





Like other kinds of sci-fi and fantasy, steampunk stories in pop culture can vary in the details of their world-building. However, steampunk worlds do have several elements in common. In general, the world of a steampunk story resembles the real world between the late 19th and early 20th century. Technology in these worlds may surpass the real world, though it will be analog rather than digital or electronic, and steam-powered. Industrialization and its consequences on both individuals and society in general are common steampunk themes.









 








 11  Drifting Dragons 
Steampunk Technology Faces Off Against Dragons
        

     Release Year   2020    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Netflix    
Easy to miss among the many popular anime series that came out in 2020, Drifting Dragons feels like a kinder, gentler Moby-Dick. The sky is an ocean and dragons are whales. For all intents and purposes, the crew of the airship Quin Zaza are steampunk whalers.
The exact English spelling of the ship&#39;s name varies depending on the source, but this is the spelling used by Netlfix, the series&#39; international distributor. 

Given the real-life reputation of whaling, that concept may be controversial or disturbing to some viewers. Still, despite the potentially uncomfortable aspects of the premise, it is an undeniably unique one. Drifting Dragons&#39;s blend of steampunk and fantasy tropes helps it stand out and there aren&#39;t really many other anime series it can be easily compared to. The series&#39; art direction also has a unique visual profile that helps complement the novel premise.





 10  Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress 
Steampunk Technology and Zombies Collide
        

     Release Year   2016    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Amazon Prime Video    
Zombie apocalypses are getting played out as a premise, so it&#39;s becoming increasingly necessary to put a novel spin on that premise to stand out as a zombie story. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress does a very good job at setting itself apart from other zombie anime thanks to an imaginative spin on a zombie story and stylish art and direction. Set in an alternate history Japan devastated by zombies called kabane, the human characters have been driven into fortified train stations and travel between them in giant armored trains. The kabane themselves are horrifying, the action is intense and brutal, the whole series has a really cool steam-powered samurai aesthetic that creates a one-of-a-kind atmosphere and allows for some unique plot beats with the premise.





 9  D.Gray-man 
A Steampunk Take on the Supernatural
        

     Release Year   2006    Number of Episodes   116    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Funimation, Tubi    
The opening scene of the first episode of D.Gray-man helpfully establishes the series to be set in &#34;The End of Fictional 19th Century.&#34; Technically, that makes D.Gra-man a historical anime series. All in all, however, thanks in no small part to the presence of magic, the exact level of technology is wildly inconsistent and the series leans fully into the more fantastical aspects of its premise.
Series lead Allen Walker is a professional exorcist, doing battle with an adversary called the Millennium Earl, who creates minions out of captured souls forced into bodies of living metal. Despite fully embracing the supernatural in its story, D.Gray-man nevertheless remains grounded in the aesthetics of the 19th century to establish its visual identity and the prominence of dark, gloomy London-esque streets creates a lot of atmosphere throughout the series.





 8  Steamboy 
Akira&#39;s Creator Makes the Most Expensive Steampunk Anime Movie Ever
        

     Release Year   2004    Runtime   126 Minutes    Where to Stream it   Roku, Tubi, Pluto TV    
Before the release of Ghibli&#39;s The Tale of Princess Kaguya, Steamboy was the most expensive anime film ever produced. From Katsuhiro Otomo, creator and director of legendary 80s anime movie Akira, Steamboy is set in an alternate history 1863 where the development of steam-powered technology has far outpaced the real world. The central conflict of the plot is driven by the various factions trying to get control of three devices called Steam Balls, which are believed to be able to provide a limitless supply of steam power and greatly progress technological development. Steamboy is making the most of its high budget. The character design and animation are great, and the alternate-history Victorian England setting allows for some beautiful setpieces and backgrounds.





 7  Samurai 7 
Samurais Get a Steampunk Redesign
        

     Release Year   2004    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Funimation    
Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai is regarded as not only one of the best samurai movies ever, but a contender for one of the best movies ever, period. Given how popular and influential Kurosawa&#39;s movies have been over the years, it&#39;s not surprising that the general concept of &#34;seven warriors hired to protect a village&#34; has been borrowed so frequently in pop culture. One of the most interesting takes on the premise is Samurai 7.
On the one hand, it&#39;s a fairly direct adaptation of the original movie to the point that all the samurai have the same names and general personality as the corresponding character in the original, and Akira Kurosawa is credited as one of the series&#39; creators. On the other hand, it greatly expands the story to fit a 26-episode runtime and introduces steampunk elements like airships, robots, and cybernetic samurai. Despite these unabashedly stylish flourishes, for the most part, Samurai 7 retains the gravitas and emotional weight of the original Kurosawa movie.





 6  Castle in the Sky 
Miyazaki&#39;s Best Steampunk Movie


 







     Release Year   1986    Runtime   124 Minutes    Where to Stream it   Max    
While several other Ghibli movies can be considered steampunk stories, and even Princess Mononoke grapples with a lot of the questions of industrialization common in the genre, Castle in the Sky is probably Ghibli&#39;s best example of steampunk anime. With the exception of advanced flying machines and airships, the world of Castle in the Sky greatly resembles the industrialized early 1900s and the plot is driven by the hunt for the lost ancient city of the title. When Sheeta, the film&#39;s heroine, accidentally awakens one of the lost city&#39;s robotic guardians, the terrifying destructive power of the city&#39;s lost technology becomes clear and Sheeta and Pazu set out to prevent the power of that technology from falling into the hands of the evil Colonel Muska.
Like many other Miyazaki movies, Castle in the Sky delivers a powerful pacifist message and environmental themes. Muska&#39;s ambition to harness the powers of the lost techology as weapons is portrayed as unambiguously evil and the giant tree growing at the center of the lost city plays both a powerful symbolic role and becomes plot-relevant by the end.





 5  Princess Principal 
Steampunk With Spies





 4   
     Release Year   2017    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Amazon Prime Video, HIDIVE    
Princess Principal&#39;s opening wouldn&#39;t sound out of place on the Persona 5 soundtrack and there are actually a surprising amount of parallels to be drawn between the two. Granted, the heroines of Princess Principal are spies rather than thieves, but they&#39;re at least broadly involved in the same sort of stealthy escapades and their spy costumes wouldn&#39;t look out of place among the Phantom Thieves. Despite the stylistic similarities, Princess Principal establishes a distinct identity for itself. Steampunk Victorian Britain is a novel setting for a spy story and that the main characters are all female further helps the series to set itself apart.
In light of the series&#39; setting, the English dub of Princess Principal, done by Sentai Filmworks, uses an all-British cast. 






 3  The Case Study of Vanitas 
Steampunk Vampires Reign Supreme
        

     Release Year   2021    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
The Case Study of Vanitas quickly establishes a few stylistic choices that help set it apart from other popular Vampire anime series. The opening scene of the very first episode narrates the history of Vanitas like a storybook or fairy tale with a unique ink-and-paper animation style resembling illustrations in a book. Fittingly, the actual Book of Vanitas, a powerful book of magic, plays a major role in the events of the plot.
Although the series&#39; version of late 1800s Paris contains many steampunk artistic flourishes, up to and including giant airships shaped like buildings, it is nevertheless a recognizable recreation of the real Paris, with many of the city&#39;s famous landmarks identifiable. Although The Case Study of Vanitas has a very idiosyncratic and established sense of humor, the series blends that with emotional depth and the horror aspects to be expected of a Vampire story.





 2  Last Exile 
A Steampunk Take on Space Opera
        

     Release Year   2003    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation    
Last Exile follows air couriers Claus and Lavie as they find themselves tasked with delivering a girl named Alvis to the crew of the pirate ship Silvana. While the military aspects of the series are reminiscent of live-action historical dramas like Sharpe and Master and Commander, but taking place in the sky rather than at sea, many of the plot beats come across as a steampunk version of classic Space Opera anime. The crew of the Silvana, pirates rebelling against an oppressive government regime, owe a clear debt to cult classic Sci-Fi anime hero Captain Harlock and his crew.
Last Exile is a pretty CGI-heavy series and, unfortunately, the 3D effects for the battleships and some of the environments haven&#39;t held up well. That&#39;s not because they&#39;re poorly done, it&#39;s simply the result of CGI technology coming a long way since Last Exile debuted in 2003. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a jaunty Celtic style that wouldn&#39;t be out of place in a pirate story. It&#39;s fitting, given that Last Exile basically treats the sky like an ocean.





 1  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 
The Undisputed King of Steampunk Anime


 







     Release Year   2009    Number of Episodes   64    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
Thanks to its engaging cast of characters and compelling plot, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has gone done as one of the most popular anime series of all time. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist is a serious contender among fans for best anime of all time. The world-building in the series is particularly impressive. With a setting based on early 20th-century Germany, Fullmetal Alchemist has a design aesthetic that really sets it apart from other Fantasy and steampunk series. The details of the fictional world are quite impressive. Creator Hiromu Arakawa put a lot of thought into her world-building and magic systems. Notably, the way Alchemy works in the series is grounded in real historical understandings of alchemy, magic, and chemistry.
The steampunk genre is inherently creative and imaginative. Thanks to the broad definition of what steampunk is, creators can take their stories and worlds in unique new directions. Although steampunk stories are united by an established set of tropes, the storytelling possibilities are virtually endless. This is demonstrated by the novel and fascinating approaches to the genre taken by the best steampunk anime of all time.
