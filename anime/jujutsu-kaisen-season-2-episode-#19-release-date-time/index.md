  The future of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 is uncertain due to production issues, but if episode #19 maintains the quality, it will still be great.   Episode #19 will feature simultaneous fights against Mahito, with dynamic and entertaining battles that will challenge Itadori and Nobara.

## Literature Review

After Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #18 started two fights with Mahito, episode #19 will continue those fights with more great choreography.




While the drama behind the scenes of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2&#39;s production makes the future of the show relatively uncertain, if episode #19 maintains the level of quality of the anime as a whole it will still be great. This is especially true if it lives up to the premise teased at the end of episode #18, and shows two simultaneous fights against Mahito. The cursed spirit&#39;s powers can make for some incredibly dynamic and entertaining fights that will push Itadori and Nobara to their limits.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #19 Releases 
          

If it isn&#39;t delayed, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #19 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, November 30. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 30 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #18? 
          




After regaining control of his body, Yuji wandered around Shibuya almost in a daze, still processing the massive amounts of people Sukuna killed. Eventually he stumbled onto Nanami, who after being half burned to death by Jogo was still fighting on against a mass of transfigured humans. Unfortunately, Mahito had found Nanami first and brutally killed him in front of Yuji. This led to an exciting fight between Mahito and an extremely angry Yuji. At the same time Nobara encountered a clone of Mahito on the surface and began her own battle against him. While this Shibuya Incident fight wasn&#39;t perfect, it was still incredibly good and left the series on an exciting note.



Yuji&#39;s fight against Mahito added some anime-original choreography not found in the manga.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #19 Will Feature More Fighting Against Mahito 
          




Given the battle against Mahito is now being waged on two fronts, the majority of episode #19 will likely focus on showing Yuji and Nobara fight him. This is bound to be an important fight and if it receives the same level of focus as the fights with Sukuna it may even be one of the best in the series. Also given his history with Mahito and the recent events in Shibuya, the fight is incredibly important for Yuji&#39;s character arc. If he and Nibara can beat Mahito here it would also allow them to get revenge for Nanami while simultaneously dealing with an incredibly strong enemy.

Given how important the next episode seems to be, hopefully the behind the scenes problems at Studio MAPPA won&#39;t cause its quality to be diminished. While episode #18 was great it definitely wasn&#39;t on the same level as the Sukuna fights, which may have potentially been because of the brutal schedule that the animators have been subjected to. Hopefully, the upcoming Mahito fights in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #19 will reach the same heights as the earlier battles in the Shibuya Incident.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #19 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 30, 2023.
