## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1087 will show more of the new status quo of the world after Wano, likely focusing on both Koby and the former Warlord Hancock.




After revealing how the Straw Hats are now viewed by the world at large, One Piece episode #1087 is primed to explore even more of the series’ new status quo. This will also build nicely on the revelations episode #1086 presented about the new pirate organization Cross Guild. It will also hopefully help establish what the next arc of the anime will be about.

 What Happened in Episode #1086 of One Piece? 
          




Episode #1086 showed the Straw Hats reacting to the news of their post-Wano bounties. This led to some hilarious character moments such as Zoro and Sanji&#39;s rivalry flaring up and Chopper still being annoyed at how low his bounty is. The episode also explored how Buggy became a Yonko with Crocodile and Mihawk working under him. It was all a misunderstanding from when Mihawk and Crocodile hunted down Buggy to collect a debt he owed them. While he didn&#39;t have the money to repay them, he offered them the services of his large crew which they accepted. Given Buggy&#39;s crew&#39;s devotion to him, however, this led to the advertising for the Cross Guild seemingly portraying Buggy as the organization&#39;s leader.



 One Piece Episode #1087 Will Show More of What Happened in the World 
          

Based on the title of the next episode, episode #1087 will likely show fans what Koby has been doing during Wano as well as showing how Boa Hancock and the Amazons are doing after the Marines turned on them. The title implies that these two plot threads are likely connected. Both storylines should be interesting, as Koby will likely continue to grow to keep up with Luffy and Boa&#39;s nation will now have to deal with being in conflict with the World Government. The show may also add some great new scenes unique to the One Piece anime like it did in Wano.




Given these plots won&#39;t likely directly involve the Straw Hats, episode #1087 probably won&#39;t show where Luffy and his friends will arrive next. However, given how deep the lore of the series is, it will likely still be incredibly exciting. So either way, One Piece episode #1087 will still be an exciting watch for long-time fans of the series.

Catch One Piece episode #1087 when it releases on Crunchyroll on December 9, 2023.
