 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 4 
          




Undead Unluck episode #4, “Do You Love the Change in Me?”, saw Fuko and Andy fight against Gena to secure a second seat on the Roundtable. While Fuko and Andy were initially unable to do anything about Gena’s invisible attacks and invisible barrier, they gained an edge after figuring out that Gena’s Negator ability was Unchange, the ability to fix non-living things in place. From there, Fuko realized there had to be an air hole in Gena’s barrier. After discerning its location, Fuko threw Andy’s head into the barrier to hit Gena with Unluck, taking the form of a laser blast from the Union’s malfunctioning UFO.

With Gena finally defeated and on the verge of death, she revealed that contrary to what she had said before, she hated that she couldn’t change anything in her life by working with the Union and accepted that change isn’t all bad. As Gena lay dying, the makeup she had fixed into place to hide her age started breaking apart, but Andy, in a final act of kindness, embraced her and said that she was beautiful even in her old age. Gena died after the two shared a kiss, and the episode ended on the tragic note of Gena’s pitiable state.

 Undead Unluck Will Be A Story Of Tragedy 
          

If there’s anything to take away from Undead Unluck episode #4, it’s that the anime will be a story of tragedy. As much as the first few episodes painted the series as a comedic action romp, Gena’s death emphasizes how cruel the world the characters inhabit is and how hard it is for Negators to get a happy ending, if not downright impossible. Undead Unluck is sure to be an anime that deals with one sad story after another, and as episode #5 is set to introduce the rest of the Union, that’s bound to become even more apparent, going forward.




Be sure to watch Undead Unluck  episode #5 when it airs on November 3.
