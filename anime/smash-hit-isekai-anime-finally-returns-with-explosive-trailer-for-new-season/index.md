## Literature Review

The long-awaited season 3 of Konosuba finally has a release window and an exciting new trailer showcasing why the series is so popular.




One of the most popular isekai anime of all time, Konosuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World!, has finally revealed the release window of its long-awaited season 3, along with an explosive trailer showcasing all the action and shenanigans fans expect from the franchise.




Season 3 of Konosuba was announced in September 2023 during the Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko 35th Anniversary Festival. However, fans did not get much besides a teaser trailer and a general release date of 2024, until now.


 

Now, the official accounts of Kadokawa and of the Konosuba anime have shared the first trailer for season 3, which also includes a release window. Fans can expect season 3 of Konosuba to drop in April 2024.


 Konosuba Made Its Fans Wait For Years To Get A New Season 
          

The Konusuba anime is based on the light novels of the same novel by Kurone Mishima and Natsume Akatsuki, which serialized from 2013 to 2020, with 17 volumes in total. The light novel was very popular, receiving an anime adaptation for season 1 back in 2016. This proved to be incredibly successful, contributing to the growth of the isekai genre in recent years. An equally acclaimed season 2 aired in 2017, but since then fans only got a movie in 2019 and a short spin-off in 2023.




Konosuba&#39;s popularity comes in great part from its incredible comedy, as the series flawlessly mixes humor and action. It also tried to subvert some established isekai and fantasy tropes, as all members of the party, the masochistic crusader Darkness, the explosion-obsessed Megumin, the absent-minded Aqua, and the reincarnated hikikomori Kazuma, are all essentially useless from an RPG perspective. Still, their personalities excellently play off each other, making sure that Konosuba stood out in the saturated field of isekai.


 

The first two seasons were animated by Studio Deen, and Studio Drive will take over for season 3, which is expected to be available on Crunchyroll just like the first two, even if no official announcement has been made. Considering how long fans had to wait for season 3 of Konosuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World! and the hype and excitement surrounding it, the series is already set to leave a mark in the packed 2024 anime season.
