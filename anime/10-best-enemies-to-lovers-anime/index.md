## Literature Review

Many of anime&#39;s best couples start out as bitter enemies before eventually becoming fiercely devoted lovers.




The best enemies to lovers anime excel at portraying one of the most beloved tropes among audiences. Not all couples begin with love at first sight – any of them feel nothing but anger toward their future partner at first, until becoming closer makes them both realize that they’re more than what they appear.
Enemies to lovers stories, more than anything, adore love that&#39;s based on intense and passionate feelings and, eventually, fully cemented by deep trust and understanding. In some cases, the couples overcome years of bad blood to be with one another. Sometimes, no one knows you more intimately than your closest enemy.









 








 10  Nisekoi Turns Fake Love Into Real Love 
Based on the manga by Naoshi Kami
        

Raku and Chitoge’s fathers are gang leaders on the verge of an all-out war. The only thing keeping the war at bay is the fact that their heirs are hopelessly in love. The catch, though, is that Raku and Chitoge actually can&#39;t stand each other, and are faking their relationship to trick their dads.
Nisekoi combines the fake dating trope with the enemies to lovers trope perfectly. Despite being one of the best anime about the mafia, it stays lighthearted and fun throughout. Raku and Chitoge go from constantly bickering to realizing that they&#39;ve genuinely come to enjoy being around one another all the time.

Based on the light novels by Satoshi Wagahara
        

The Devil King and the Hero of Justice are enemies by nature. The Hero, Emilia, follows Sadao Maou through an interdimensional portal he escaped through intending on vanquishing him for real.

 7  Space Patrol Luluco Is All About Dysfunction 
Original anime by Studio Trigger


Space Patrol Luluco is all about high-energy space shenanigans. Perhaps naturally, not one, but two of the central relationships of the show are enemies to lovers. These include Luluco&#39;s parents, Keiji and Lalaco, and Luluco&#39;s romance with her beau, Nova.
Part of Luluco&#39;s exposition in the first episode is how Lalaco ran out on them after a fight with Keiji and stole all their stuff, and it&#39;s still unclear where any kind of settled family life fit into the passions of a space cop and space pirate. However, they will chase each other all over the galaxy out of love. Similarly, it&#39;s Luluco&#39;s love that gives the Nothingling Nova emotions, and when he is lost, Luluco swears to search forever until she finds him, despite how he has betrayed her in the past.

 5  Whisper Of The Heart Tells A Heartfelt Love Story 
Original anime movie by Studio Ghibli


 







Whisper of the Heart was directed by animator Yoshifumi Kondo: his sole directorial credit before his passing in 1998. 

Shizuku Tsukishima and Seiji Amasawa are one of the best Studio Ghibli couples, and also one of the few that are explicitly romantic. However, it takes them the full movie to admit it. After reading Seiji’s name in the check-out cards of all her library books, Shizuku has a romantic fantasy of who he is, which is promptly shattered when they actually meet.
Seiji and Shizuku have a knack for getting on each other’s nerves. But the more time they spend together, the clearer it becomes that they are also one another&#39;s greatest support. Their deepening love and admiration gives them the courage they need to take risks and pursue their dreams, no matter how frightening or difficult the journey is.

Written by Reiko Yoshida and based on the play by William Shakespeare

After Lord Montague usurped the throne in a bloody coup, Juliet was left as the sole survivor of the royal family. Now, she&#39;s determined to end the oppression of Neo Verona.
One of the best anime based on classic literature – quite loosely, in this case – centers around the most famous star-crossed lovers in history. In this production, both clans are more explicitly antagonistic, with the Montagues massacring the Capulets and Juliet attacking them in disguise for revenge. Nevertheless, Juliet finds herself falling for Romeo Montague, her sworn enemy, and the polar opposite of his father.
