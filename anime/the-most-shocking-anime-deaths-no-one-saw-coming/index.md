## Literature Review

Anime is no stranger to sudden and shocking deaths, and there are some that stood out, making fans jump out of their seats.




Anime, as is the case with any medium, is no stranger to killing off characters in unexpected and often brutal ways. When handled right, a good death can help set the tone for how a story will progress, and if it happens at the end of a story, it can either force the characters to grow through tragedy or show how it’s almost impossible for victory to come without sacrifices.
        

Killing off characters is almost always a big deal, and when a character’s death comes seemingly out of nowhere, perhaps because they’re not the kind of character anyone would expect to die, the suddenness of it all makes the impact of the death in question even greater and takes the story to even greater heights. Those kinds of deaths, when executed properly, are always great to see, and several anime, in particular, have very noteworthy examples of them.
            
 
 10 Saddest Anime Deaths, Ranked 
The deaths of well-loved anime characters remain etched in viewers&#39; minds, whether they are shocking, tear-jerking, or a combination of both.












 








 10  Maes Hughes Showed That No One Was Safe In Fullmetal Alchemist 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Episode #10
        

In both the original anime and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Maes Hughes had developed into a great ally and form of support for Edward, Mustang, and many others, so it came off as an incredible shock when Hughes was killed by Envy early on in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood when he managed to figure out what the Homunculi were planning for Amestris.
aceHughes’ death made it clear that no one was safe in the series, and the incident served as a major motivation for Mustang up until the very end of the story.





 9  Kite Returned To Hunter X Hunter Just To Die 
Hunter X Hunter Episode #85
        

Kite made a surprise return to Hunter X Hunter when Gon and Killua ended up finding him instead of Ging after the Greed Island arc, and while he was set up as another mentor character for the two, Kite was quickly killed off at the beginning of the Chimera Ant arc when he was forced to defend Gon and Killua from Neferpitou.
Granted, Kite was later revealed to have reincarnated as Meruem’s female twin, but that doesn’t make his death any less sudden nor any less impactful on the story, as a whole. Kite&#39;s death was a huge motivation for all the pain and growth Gon underwent during the Chimera Ant arc too.

 8  Rengoku’s Death Didn’t Diminish His Heroism In Demon Slayer 
Demon Slayer: Mugen Train


 







For fairly recent anime, a death that came off as incredibly shocking was Kyojuro Rengoku’s in Demon Slayer: Mugen Train. Rengoku was very quick to establish himself as a charismatic and noble figure everyone couldn’t help but admire, and that made it all the more surprising when Rengoku, despite essentially debuting in Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, died at the end of his grueling battle with Akaza.
Rengoku’s death was especially impactful due to how long of a gap there was between season 1 and the film, but as tragic as it was, it only served to emphasize how heroic a person he was, even with relatively little screentime.
            
 
 20 Saddest Demon Slayer Deaths, Ranked

 7  Jonathan Joestar Showed That No One Was Safe From Tragedy In JoJo 
JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Episode #9
        

In JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood. Jonathan had just spent the entire series ridding himself and the world of Dio and had more than earned his happy ending with Erina, but just when fans were enjoying that conclusion, tragedy struck.
In the final episode of Phantom Blood, Dio, still alive as a head, attacked Jonathan in an attempt to take his body, and Jonathan died while embracing Dio as the two of them were engulfed in flames. Jonathan’s tragic death made it clear that no one was safe in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and that idea has been maintained in all the decades to follow.

 6  Goku’s Second Death Helped Set Dragon Ball On A New Path 
Dragon Ball Z Episode #188


 







Goku’s first death set up the stage for the grandness that was Dragon Ball Z. His second death, instead, happened right when the Android saga seemed to have reached its climax, with Gohan unlocking Super Saiyan 2 and being on the verge of victory against Cell. However, Gohan’s cockiness gave Cell a chance to turn himself into a bomb to destroy the Earth, forcing Goku to sacrifice his life to protect everyone.
Even with Gohan’s sudden growth, it was utterly unexpected to see Goku die again, but it did help Gohan develop into his own person for the following, and originally final, story of Dragon Ball. Akira Toriyama&#39;s original intention was to use this to set up Gohan as the new protagonist, but negative reaction from fans caused Goku to come back again soon later.

 5  Light More Than Deserved His Demise In Death Note 
Death Note Episode #37
        

Villainous characters can also be victims of shocking deaths, and a perfect example of that is Light Yagami’s death in Death Note. Death Note had finally reached the point when Light was outsmarted by Near and exposed as Kira. Despite Light’s attempts to either talk his way out of trouble or kill more of his enemies, he’s ultimately left with no options.
Light ends up being killed by Ryuk writing his name in his Death Note, a very cathartic ending for the story. Even if Light was the villain, it was still surprising to see him lose at the very end, especially in the manga where, unlike the anime, his death wasn’t dignified in the slightest.

 4  Lelouch’s Death Brought Code Geass To A Perfect Conclusion 
Code Geass R2 Episode 25
        

Another shocking death from a villainous character in an anime was Lelouch vi Britannia’s death in Code Geass. After making himself the most hated person in the world, Code Geass’ finale revealed that all of Lelouch’s recent actions were to unite the world against a common enemy, and the final step in ushering in a new era of peace was, surprisingly, for Lelouch to be killed by Zero.
After everything that had happened in Code Geass, seeing it end with Lelouch dead was nothing but surprising, but with everything it led to, there was no better way for Lelouch’s story and the anime, as a whole, to end.

 3  Ace’s Death Broke One Of The Biggest Traditions In One Piece 
One Piece Episode #483


 







Deaths are an easy way of setting the tone for a story going forward, and a perfect example of that was Ace’s death in One Piece. One Piece was infamous for never killing anyone outside of flashbacks, so it was nothing but surprising when Ace ended up being the first One Piece character to explicitly die. 
This was even more shocking for fans because it happened right after Luffy managed to apparently save Ace from execution. There was no reason to expect Ace to die at that point, but the suddenness of it all served to emphasize how big a deal it was and how much of a darker story One Piece would evolve into.

 2  Mami’s Death Showed Just What Kind Of Story Madoka Magica Would Be 
Puella Magi Madoka Magica Episode #3
        

Another shocking death that helped to set the tone of its story going forward was Mami Tomoe’s death in Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Madoka Magica initially seemed to be a standard magical girl anime, albeit with surreal animation and a few dark story elements, but all of that changed in episode #3.
Mami was abruptly killed off just as she had started receiving a semblance of character development. Mami’s death showed that Puella Magi Madoka Magica would be anything but a standard magical girl anime and would instead lean heavily into dark storytelling, and the franchise has kept to that idea ever since.

 1  Kamina’s Death In Gurren Lagann Is One Of The Most Iconic In All Of Anime 
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Episode #8
        

One of the most iconic deaths in anime must be Kamina’s death in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Kamina had been established as the heart of Gurren Lagann from the moment he first appeared, so it was nothing but a shock to see him die as early as episode #8, leaving Simon as the sole protagonist of the anime.
Kamina’s death, as sudden as it was, helped to push Gurren Lagann into becoming as great a story as it is, and the anime’s success, in turn, has served to make it one of the most shocking deaths in all of anime.
