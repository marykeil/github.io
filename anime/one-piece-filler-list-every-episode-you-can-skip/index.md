# One Piece Filler List Every Episode You Can Skip


## SUMMARY 



  One Piece has surprisingly low filler episodes compared to other popular anime like Naruto and Bleach, with only 9% of episodes being filler.   Some filler episodes in One Piece are worth watching as they add to the legitimate manga material, but others are completely fabricated and have no value.   One standout filler arc in One Piece is the G-8 arc (episodes 196-208), which provides comedic moments and showcases the Straw Hat crew&#39;s individual skills while telling a compelling story.

## Literature Review

As with any anime series, One Piece comes with a selection of filler episodes. Which adventures aren&#39;t canon, and which One Piece arcs can you skip?




Here are all the filler episodes in One Piece and the story arcs fans can safely sail over without missing anything important. Adapting the long-running manga series by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece takes place in a world where piracy reigns supreme on the seas, and Monkey D. Luffy is just one of hundreds seeking the legendary treasure known as One Piece. When it comes to weekly anime series, however, filler episodes are an unfortunate fact of life. Defined as anything not found within the original manga, filler episodes are usually lighter, inconsequential stories written by the animation company to avoid catching up with the manga.




Compared to the likes of Naruto, Bleach, and Dragon Ball Z, the One Piece anime is surprisingly light on filler. Despite clocking in at over 1,000 episodes, the TV show doesn&#39;t stray into non-canon territory often, and One Piece filler also isn&#39;t as bad as fans might&#39;ve seen in other anime series. No Luffy and Zoro learning to drive here.



All episodes of One Piece are streaming on Crunchyroll &amp; Funimation.




Plenty of One Piece episodes embellish legitimate manga material with scenes filler - an extended fight scene here, some additional dialogue there - and these are definitely worth watching, but others are fabricated entirely and contain nothing of value.

 One Piece Filler Episodes That Are A Secret Treasure 
         

While One Piece&#39;s later episodes involve a lot of large-scale situations, twisted class wars, and disgustingly evil villains, the series didn&#39;t start with its stakes so high. One common complaint with later One Piece content is that viewers don&#39;t get much time to watch the Straw Hat crew interacting with one another, which they often did in filler episodes during the first half of the series. Many filler episodes contain light-hearted scenes filled with comedy and time for the Straw Hat crew&#39;s iconic cast to show off their character&#39;s quirks in a way intense canon stories don&#39;t always have time for. However, one particular filler arc after Skypiea exceeded all expectations and even surpassed some of One Piece&#39;s arcs.

Episodes 196 - 208 feature an arc entirely missing from Eiichiro Oda&#39;s manga, where the Straw Hats land the heavily damaged Going Merry in the middle of the impenetrable G-8 Marine base. The ship is captured, and many of the Straw Hats must go undercover as Marines to find a means of escape. The filler arc is filled with moments for each crewmate to shine, including Sanji&#39;s infectious cooking, Robin&#39;s infiltration skills, Usopp&#39;s effective lying, and Luffy&#39;s lack of subtlety, creating some of the biggest laughs of the series while telling and compelling story of cat and mouse as the Straw Hat&#39;s avoid total capture. Even One Piece manga purists will find much to love in the G-8 filler arc.




                  One Piece NEEDS A Filler Arc After Wano, And Here&#39;s Why   The conclusion of the Wano Arc in One Piece marks the perfect time for the series to do something it hasn&#39;t done in years: a filler arc.   



 How One Piece&#39;s Filler Content Compares to Other Shonen Anime 
          

As of the time of writing, One Piece has 94 filler episodes accounting for just under 9% of all episodes. That 9% is actually pretty impressive considering many other huge shonen anime produced in its era. Naruto&#39;s anime was made up of around 40% filler while Bleach clocked in at roughly 45% filler. Though One Piece&#39;s 9% filler is considered low even compared to Dragon Ball&#39;s 13% filler, it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to many modern shonen anime as My Hero Academia has only 3% while even more recent hits like Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen actually have no filler at all.




Still though, for an anime that&#39;s been running weekly for more than two decades, only having to resort to anime original stories 9% of the time is an impressive feat. Considering One Piece&#39;s manga is among the longest-running comics by a singular creator though, it&#39;s no wonder the anime adaptation doesn&#39;t often run into gaps where it don&#39;t have enough material to adapt. This ultimately comes down to the series&#39; animation studio, Toei, being smart about what scenes from the manga warrant expansion. One Piece&#39;s filler list truly is a testament to the series&#39; impressive length and scope.
