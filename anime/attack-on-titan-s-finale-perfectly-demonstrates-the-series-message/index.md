## Literature Review

From the beginning, Attack on Titan was always about the futility of war. In the end, MAPPA managed to deliver a finale that justified its message.




Warning: This Article Contains Spoilers for Attack on Titan!




Attack on Titan&#39;s decade-long journey has finally come to an end, with its final 85-minute episode that perfectly laid out its ultimately pacifist message. One part dieselpunk action-thriller, one part fantasy-horror, Attack on Titan will go down as a white-knuckle &#34;hack &#39;n slash&#34; that always managed to consistently hit at least one highbrow bar in its run: the realities of war violence.

Attack on Titan&#39;s finale focused almost entirely on the surviving Survey Corps members&#39; battle against their onetime friend Eren Yeager and his army of resurrected super Titans. The prevailing air throughout the episode is one of palpable desperation, as Eren&#39;s impossibly-powered Founding Titan form threatens to lay waste to the last vestiges of humanity.


 




What rises to the surface amid this veritable symphony of carnage and destruction, quite appropriately, is the sense of vulnerability the remaining protagonists embody. It is no mistake that, with few other characters able to take the role, Mikasa Ackerman comes to the fore as a symbol of heroism, albeit one whose life is irreparably stained by the violence the series&#39; message stands against.

                  Attack on Titan&#39;s True Meaning Explains All of its Best Twists   Known for its blend of horror and action, Attack on Titan’s true meaning blows every other twist of the series out of the water.

Though certainly a whirlwind of top-notch action, by showcasing one last, incredibly well-constructed signature battle sequence, Attack on Titan&#39;s finale stayed very much in line with its no-nonsense, non-glorification of the horrors of combat. Rather than eliciting moments of celebration, the brief reprieves in tension often find the characters in tears of exhaustion and grief. Likewise, the narrative focuses heavily on the psychological stress the heroes undergo during battle.




Jean, who earlier in the series was often relegated to the role of Eren&#39;s doubting rival and bully, is forced to detonate a belt of explosives around Eren&#39;s neck, tears streaming down his cheeks as he calls Eren one last childish, cruel name. Reiner breaks down in tears as he sees his friends and family transformed into Titans by the Source of All Life, crying out for their torment to end. Finally, Mikasa manages to infiltrate Eren&#39;s skull and decapitate him, only to end the violent foray by tenderly kissing him, as the ghost of Ymir smiles softly in the background. A twisted scene, but one which underscores the cost of such horrors in the world.

From the outset of the series, the Titans represented an overwhelming threat to peace and stability, a chaotic force of the unknown which at any moment could lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. As Eren himself came to represent this threat in the final episodes, initiating the apocalyptic Rumbling with an army of Colossal Titans, so too did his former allies themselves come to be defined by their own vulnerability in the face of his destructive power. While the final battle is successful in warding off the apocalypse, the end credit scenes of the episode hint that, unfortunately, war will once again rage across the world, as technology advances and weapons of mass destruction proliferate among nations.




                  Attack On Titan&#39;s Finale Fixes One Of The Manga&#39;s Biggest Problems   Attack on Titan&#39;s final chapter became incredibly divisive for a variety of reasons, and the anime adaptation has fixed one of its biggest issues.   

This lack of a satisfying conclusion, rather than going against the overall message of the series, actually goes a long way towards explaining what the point of this story is. Violence and reprisals of violence must be met with peace and understanding lest it eventually engulf the world. In its own dark and twisted way, Mikasa&#39;s love for Eren is emblematic of this theme: a love and dedication so total, despite Eren&#39;s undeniably evil actions, that she would fight through an army of monsters in order to kill him and end his pain motivated only by that love. A pure love perhaps, but one coming from a person tragically broken by violence and war. A final philosophical quandary of great value from Attack on Titan.
