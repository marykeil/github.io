## Literature Review

The student is now the master, as Shigaraki proves he has outgrown All for One with a single, decisive sentence that shut the villain&#39;s plans down.





All for One has been struggling in recent chapters, his age reverting younger and younger with each near-fatal attack he takes--and there&#39;s been a lot of them from All Might. All for One now has the appearance of a young boy, meaning there&#39;s not much room for him to grow younger, lest he be reverted to an actual baby and rendered completely helpless. All for One&#39;s plan meant for him to reunite with Shigaraki, conferring an ultimate power upon him, but All for One&#39;s attempts at doing so were cut short when he actually got blocked for the very first time from enacting his plan.





 Shigaraki is More Powerful than All for One Now 
          

It seems his body isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s been growing weaker, though, as All for One attempted to use the Gloop Warp on Shigaraki to draw him over to him, only for Shigaraki to stop the warp mid-attempt, telling him &#34;don&#39;t butt in.&#34; It&#39;s the first time anyone has ever stopped All for One from using a Quirk on them, something even Shigaraki wasn&#39;t able to do not too long ago. While Shigaraki has grown phenomenally more powerful over the course of the final battle, All for One has been getting weaker and weaker with each de-aging, and it&#39;s finally hit the point where Shigaraki&#39;s power apparently exceeds what All for One has left.

Ironically, what All for One intended to be his greatest victory has turned out to be his greatest embarrassment. Not only has he been beaten up by an All Might who&#39;s utterly Quirkless, but now even his successor has rejected him in favor of fighting on his own. All for One is left on the brink of defeat, if not already defeated by All Might&#39;s final attack; it&#39;s a particularly humiliating fate for the wannabe demon lord, whose plans have almost completely failed at this point. Of course, there&#39;s still plenty of damage that Shigaraki can do, and the other consciousness of All for One lurking within Shigaraki could always resurface.




Shigaraki&#39;s power is undoubtedly beyond the level of All for One&#39;s now, which means that the biggest threat is still on the board for the villains. Deku is currently facing off with Shigaraki, and seems to have some awareness of what&#39;s going on via the vestige of All Might within One for All. With most of the other conflicts resolved, the time is coming for Deku and Shigaraki to finally have their long-awaited showdown. My Hero Academia&#39;s most anticipated battle is on its way, and there&#39;s nothing that All for One can do to influence it now that Shigaraki has him outclassed.
