  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Anime villains often rely on their intelligence and manipulative personalities rather than brute power to be major threats.
These villains understand what makes other people tick, manipulating them to act in their favor.
They utilize tactics such as creating cult-like followings, employing illusions, and exploiting insecurities to achieve their goals.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The best anime villains manipulate, deceive, and control the heroes and everyone around them to get their way, as seen in Monster and Chainsaw Man.</p>
<p>Some of anime&rsquo;s most manipulative villains don&rsquo;t need power to be major threats. Many of them get by on their smarts and their ruthless personalities. Whether working in the background or deceiving everyone right under the heroes’ noses, they are running the show and influencing everyone to act in their favor.
The best of these characters make viewers understand very clearly why they have gotten their way for so long: sometimes longer than the heroes have been alive! They are not only smart, but charismatic and convincing, understanding exactly what makes other people tick. Often, they are older than the rest of the cast and have a better understanding of the world they live in, which they use to their advantage.</p>
<p>12  Toichiro Suzuki Ran a Cult
Series: Mob Psycho 100 (2016 - 2022)​​​</p>
<p>Claw boss Toichiro was framed as Mob Psycho 100&rsquo;s true big villain for most of the first two seasons, and given some of his actions, it&rsquo;s not difficult to see why. Playing off people&rsquo;s innate need to feel special, Toichiro developed a cult-like following of espers and esper-wannabes with the goal of taking over the world. Just like any good cult leader, Toichiro uses his sheer force of will and determination to bowl people over and bend them to his will. A particularly notable example of this is the ever-anxious Serizawa. Toichiro used Serizawa&rsquo;s anxiety to manipulate him into joining his quest for world domination. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Mob knocking some sense into him, Toichiro might well have conquered the world with his raw power and manipulative cunning.

<p>11  Sousuke Aizen is a Master of Perfect Illusions
Series: Bleach (2004 - 2012; 2022 - present)</p>
<p>Aizen is introduced as a kind and noble hero of Soul Society, who is murdered trying to investigate corruption in the organization. The reveal that he engineered both that corruption and his faked death for his own ends is just the beginning of all the ways he jerks his former comrades around. Even outside his skills in battle, Aizen has an unfortunate talent for giving speeches that enrage or demoralize his opponents too much to fight.</p>
<p>Huge Bleach Twist Confirms Aizen&rsquo;s Role in Ichigo&rsquo;s Past
Ichigo and the series&rsquo; biggest villain, Sosuke Aizen, have a lot of history together, but it turns out that history goes farther back than expected.</p>
<p>Naturally, his zanpakuto’s powers of illusion are perfectly suited for manipulation, and they make him an enormous pain to fight. Favorite tactics of his include tricking his opponents into attacking their allies, thinking they’re him, and letting them believe they’ve landed a fatal blow so they’ll let their guards down. Aizen’s intelligence and arrogance might be his eventual downfall, but they go a long way to getting him what he wants first.

<p>10  Naraku is Vindictive and Vicious
Series: Inuyasha (2000 - 2004; 2009 - 2010)</p>
<p>Befitting his motif of a massive spider hanging back in a web, Naraku is the type of villain who rarely faces the heroes head-on. He usually prefers to send his minions out after them, and even in actual battle, is better at misdirection than swordplay. However, this doesn’t mean he doesn’t have ways of breaking his enemies.
All bonds of love and trust suddenly become endangered when Naraku opens his mouth. Rather than make him compassionate, Naraku&rsquo;s intricate understanding of human relationships only makes him more skilled at corrupting the good and turning friends against each other. Naraku doesn’t even know what he’ll do when he secures the Shikon Jewel he’s been causing all this chaos for, only that he’s having a lot of fun doing it.

<p>9  Black Zetsu Hides in the Shadows
Series: Naruto (2002 - 2017)</p>
<p>Naruto has no shortage of extremely intelligent villains. Often, they can be found trying to one-up each other in the diabolical machinations department. But in the final arcs, a surprising dark horse appears to reveal that all the events of the show have happened by his design — Black Zetsu!</p>
<p>Naruto&rsquo;s Most Popular Characters Reunite in New Art From Series Creator
The creator of Naruto has released his first original artwork in years, showcasing the series&rsquo; most popular characters like never before.</p>
<p>Zetsu has been in the background for the entirety of Shippuden, his true origins and intentions unclear. He’s smart enough to pretend to be other villains’ mindless servant until the very last second, when the time is right to backstab them all and kick off his actual plan. Zetsu has been manipulating events since the days of the Sage of Six Paths to ensure the revival of his true master, Kaguya, by turning the Sage’s sons against each other to keep the enmity between their descendants alive.

<p>8  Izaya Orihara Gathers Information for His Own Ends
Series: Durarara!! (2010 - 2016)</p>
<p>Izaya is Ikebukuro’s top information broker, and he loves what he does. The knowledge Izaya gathers about all the district’s most colorful and corrupt figures allows him to pit them against each other to his liking. He almost never gets involved in the action himself: despite his ruthlessness, he is far from the strongest fighter in the show and is highly vulnerable to knives and flying trash cans.
Outside of his actual schemes, Izaya’s manipulative personality is most clearly shown in the board game he plays in the episode “Out of Your Control.” It’s a game of his own invention played with pieces from several different games on a chessboard, the rules of which are comprehensible only to him. The goal isn’t even to win: at the end of the game, Izaya sets the entire board on fire.

<p>7  Kyubey Manipulates Girls to their Doom
Series: Puella Magi Madoka Magica (2011)</p>
<p>As an alien, Kyubey has a very different view on what counts as manipulation, deceit, and even right and wrong than humans do. However, as humans, fans of Madoka are horrified by the way Kyubey promises girls a bright future, only to take advantage of them to the point where they all inevitably die young. His true intentions make Madoka a must-watch darker take on the magical girl genre.
Kyubey has a face that is impossible to read, a perpetually calm voice, and a soft, small feline form: all factors enticing his targets to trust him. He plays on the teenagers’ deepest insecurities and desires to get them to accept his deal and become magical girls. When he’s accused of deliberately withholding the actual consequences of that deal, he simply claims it’s their own fault for not asking something he gave them no indication they ought to ask.

<p>6  Ren Gyokuen is a Shadowy Body-Stealing Minister
Series: Magi: The Labyrinth Of Magic (2012 - 2014)</p>
<p>Gyokuen installed herself in the upper echelons of the militaristic country of Kou centuries ago, knowing exactly where to go to sow chaos throughout the world. Gyokuen stayed alive by swapping out her soul into her children’s bodies every few decades, eventually making her way onto the throne and using Kou’s army alongside her own cult of magicians to further her plans for the apocalypse.
She doesn’t need to control every person in the empire to get what she wants: just the royal family. To stay in power, she murders her husband and oldest sons, putting her nephews in a position where they could not depose her without harming the empire. Gyokuen’s one mistake is underestimating the determination that her surviving son, Hakuryuu, and her kidnapped Magi, Judal, have to make her pay for what she did in one of anime’s best revenge plots.

<p>5  Johan Liebert is the Perfect Manipulative Criminal
Series: Monster (2004 - 2005)</p>
<p>It’s up in the air exactly how Johan manages to make everybody who comes in contact with him dance to his tune. Whether it was the experimentation performed on him and his sister Nina as children or a sinister aspect of Johan’s own nature, it’s chillingly effective. All Johan needs to do is open his mouth, and he gets exactly what he wants from everyone he encounters.
Being one of anime&rsquo;s most evil siblings is only the tip of the iceberg with this guy. Johan commands a cult following around himself without trying, influences children to die for him just by speaking to them, and talks a recovered alcoholic back into his addiction for his own amusement. His inhuman qualities allow him to escape detection from even genius investigators and pass blame for his crimes into innocent people.

<p>4  Makima Uses Authority To Control
Series: Chainsaw Man (2022)</p>
<p>One of the most recent additions to the ranks of manipulative villains, Makima doesn’t waste an ounce of the power her position with the Public Safety Devil Hunters Bureau gives her. The minute she meets Denji, she immediately understands how easy it will be to command his loyalty. Denji craves not just food and safety, but human connection and comfort as well, and Makima uses these desires to keep him on a short leash.
Denji is far from the only person she exploits, however. Makima detests having anything outside of her control and goes to great lengths to keep everyone she can under her thumb. She’s not given to outright lying, but prefers deception through giving very limited information or vague answers to direct questions.

<p>3  Father is a Selfish Warmonger
Series: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2009 - 2010)</p>
<p>Father existed long before Amestris did — was in fact instrumental in shaping the country — and has long controlled every move its government made. Father schemes from the shadows while sending out his Homunculi offspring to do his will, from acting as puppet dictators to committing murders that spark genocidal wars. Even Amestrian alchemy is nothing but a tool in his hands: not only did he give it to Amestris in hopes of creating sacrifices, but because it came from him, he can turn it off if it’s ever used against him.</p>
<p>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood Dethroned: New Anime At Top of My Anime List
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has been dethroned as the king of MyAnimeList&rsquo;s top anime list by Oshi no Ko&rsquo;s exceptional first episode.</p>
<p>His origins also center around his manipulating Van Hohenheim, then a nameless slave of the kingdom of Xerxes, into freeing him from his flask. He uses this friendship to get all the way to the ear of Xerxes’ king, managing to dupe him into annihilating the entire country so he can obtain a human body. Doing the same to Amestris is his attempt to achieve true godhood.

<p>2  Dio Brando is a Sociopath with Delusions of Grandeur
Series: JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure (2012 - 2015)</p>
<p>Dio is so iconic that he&rsquo;s arguably more recognizable than any of the actual stars of JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure, barring perhaps Jotaro. That icon status is well-earned too, as Dio exudes evil in every single appearance he&rsquo;s made. It&rsquo;s a testament to Dio&rsquo;s charisma and ability to manipulate others that he was even able to become such a powerful man in the first place. Gaining access to the Stone Mask to become a vampire, surviving decapitation, and then forming a new cult-like following after being away for a century only drives home just how determined Dio is to gain power. The fact that Dio&rsquo;s actions in Part 3 still have large implications for the series all the way up to Part 6 just goes to prove that Dio is among the upper echelon of Anime villains.

<p>1  Light Yagami is Anime&rsquo;s Most Manipulative Villain
Series: Death Note (2006 - 2007)</p>
<p>Light certainly wouldn’t consider himself a villain, but he checks off all the same boxes as other villains of his type. He has worked all his life to perfect the image of a model student and citizen he presents, in order to hide his intense god complex and resentment for a world he deems corrupt and inferior to himself. Light knows what people expect of him, and he is scarily good at predicting what others will do.
L proves very quickly that he is more than a match for Light, and fairly manipulative himself. But Light still manages to keep his head above water as he infiltrates the investigation team hunting him. He’s even willing to put himself at a disadvantage to divert suspicion from himself, trusting that he’s got Misa and their Shinigami wrapped around his finger enough that they will do what he needs even while he’s lost his memories. Anime&rsquo;s most manipulative villainsare all living proof that in the contest between brains versus brawn, brains tend to win out more often than not.
