## Literature Review

Aniplex&#39;s teased projects &#34;O&#34; and &#34;M&#34; have been revealed to be new Monogatari anime to be produced by  SHAFT, a tradition by this point.




A secret project teased by Aniplex was revealed as the return of the supernatural light novel series Monogatari with two new SHAFT anime adaptations for Off Season and Monster Season. This marks a sudden uptick in activity after the franchise went relatively dormant in 2019. While the novels are still being published, it appears SHAFT is ready to pick up the slack with these two new projects, which are currently in production.




While the new Kizumonogatari compilation movie only just released in January, it was clearly just a prelude to a new barrage of adaptations of NisiOisin&#39;s supernatural novels. While it has been almost 5 years since the last Monogatari anime project, it appears all the staff responsible for SHAFT&#39;s previous works have reunited, ensuring that the anime remains as quirky as ever.


 

Both &#34;seasons&#34; pick up at different points in the original Monogatari storyline. Aniplex, which unveiled the new trailer, teased the new anime with websites announcing projects codenamed &#34;O&#34; and &#34;M&#34;, which can be taken to mean &#34;Off Season&#34; and &#34;Monster Season&#34;.

                  New Anime Movie Makes Japanese History With Longest Commercial Ever   The new Koyomi Vamp movie made history with Japan&#39;s longest commercial, and fans can see it for themselves now that it has been put online.   





 Monogatari Continues With Short Stories &amp; Brand New Content 
Produced by SHAFT, based on the original light novels by Nisio Isin
         

According to Anime News Network, various SHAFT creatives are returning for this next Monogatari production, including Akiyuki Simbo as chief director, Midori Yoshizawa as director, Akio Watanabe as character designer and chief animation director, with Simbo and Fuyashi Tou overseeing scripts. The last anime in the franchise the team worked on together was Zoku Owarimonogatari, which aired in 2019. This marked the end of the original storyline, beginning with Bakemonogatari.

The &#34;Season&#34; series of novels were originally written by Nisio Isin in 2015, with the latest releasing in 2021. The &#34;Off Season&#34; novels tell various short stories that occur at different points throughout the original series of events, while &#34;Monster Season&#34; is a continuation that follows the cast into college. SHAFT, therefore, is responsible for two very different groups of stories. At the moment, it has not been clarified how the adaptations will be organized, but fans can expect two new seasons of the anime in the future, be it this year or later on.




          

Monogatari fans will be happy to see SHAFT back in the saddle after so long. While the new Kizumonogatari movie has already been released, a compilation film is a far cry from fresh material. Thankfully, Nisio Isin&#39;s continued efforts have provided SHAFT with more than enough material to give anime fans not just one, but two projects after the lengthy hiatus. All that remains to be seen is exactly what form Off Season and Monster Season will take, given they are nebulously just &#34;in production&#34;. Still, little can deter fans&#39; excitement about seeing more Monogatari and SHAFT&#39;s idiosyncratic visuals.
