## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons Episode #32 sees the crew dealing with the Lapras that once belonged to the legendary adventurer, Lucius. Here&#39;s how to watch.




After Pokémon Horizons&#39; crew made contact with Lucius&#39;s Lapras, they discovered that the creature spoken of in legend wasn&#39;t exactly what they had expected, and that getting it to cooperate might be a challenge in episode #32. Here&#39;s how to tune in to the latest episode of Pokémon and find out what happens next.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

New episodes of Pokémon Horizons currently premiere at 6:55 PM JST each Friday on the Japanese network TVTokyo. Episode #32 will air Friday, December 8, 2023, at 6:55 PM JST. That time translates to 4:55 Eastern Time, and 1:55 Western Time, an inconvenient time for most potential American viewers. These broadcasts, being intended for Japanese audiences, also do without subtitles, so some knowledge of Japanese may be necessary to follow the plot. Pokémon Horizons&#39; English dub has already begun debuting on BBC in the UK, while the American release is now set for February 23, 2024.



The US home for Pokémon Horizons will be Netflix.









 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #31? 
          

Pokémon Horizons episode #31 showcased the Lapras which once belonged to the Ancient Adventurer, Lucius. It was first shown escorting ships through heavy mist, giving the impression of it as a mythical savior. However, as Friede and the airship crew set down in the waters near where Lapras was last reported, Liko and Roy find that the ship comes under attack by land-based Pokémon while in the deep fog. Friede goes through the mist again, this time with cargo boxes on the deck, which lures the Pokémon out. When the fog is dispersed, the team catch these Pokémon Pirates red-handed, apparently pulling a scam with Lapras&#39;s help, shocking everyone with Lapras&#39;s true nature.



 Pokémon Horizons Episode #32 Attempts to Reason with Lapras 
          




Lapras has turned out to be very different from how Liko and Roy expected it to be, but it&#39;s still one of the Ancient Adventurer&#39;s Pokémon, and they need its help. Lapras has its team of Pokémon Pirates at the ready to defend against the airship, however, so getting it to listen won&#39;t be easy. With the aid of Terapagos, Liko and Roy will attempt to get through to Lapras and remind it of its former companions, Lucius&#39;s other Pokémon. Terapagos is shown gathering energy in the preview, with the Ancient Poké Balls glowing in resonance with it, suggesting it may take on its true form in the anime for the first time.

Lucius&#39;s Lapras&#39;s behavior proves that not all Pokémon of a species are alike; most Lapras have a reputation for being kind, gentle creatures, but this Lapras is huge, scarred, and seems quite vicious. It&#39;s definitely an unexpected twist coming from the Pokémon anime, portraying a Pokémon in such a different way than usual. Lapras likely has its reasons for resorting to such scams, however, so it&#39;s worth hearing it out and learning why it got involved in all this. Pokémon Horizons has proved the dangers of making assumptions with this Lapras, so hopefully Liko and Roy can appreciate Lapras for what it is once they know the truth.
