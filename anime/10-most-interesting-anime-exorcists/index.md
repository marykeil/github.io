## Literature Review

Anime exorcists are used to dealing with the obscure forces of the world, and they are unfazed by them, no matter if it&#39;s spirits, ghosts, or demons.




The most interesting anime exorcists tend to stand out in a number of ways, either through their identity or situation. After all, exorcism, as a concept, lends itself to a variety of stories, as it facilitates encounters with different spirits and mysterious creatures that affect humanity in some way or another.
Typically, exorcists are defined by their activities, as they set out to clear the world of evil spirits who threaten humanity. Moreover, the spirits themselves tend to be similar in origin, as they most commonly represent the manifestation of negative human emotions. Regardless of the methods they adopt, exorcists always seek harmony and peace above all.

Blue Exorcist’s Rin Okumura is a truly unique exorcist, as he harbors a deep connection to the species he’s actively fighting against.

Although he lacks the extensive formal training that some of his exorcist peers have, Rin’s heritage gives him unique abilities such as his iconic blue flames, as well as virtually unmatched potential, making him a force to be reckoned with.

Mononoke, produced by Toei Animation
        

  Release Year   2007    Number of Episodes   12    Where To Stream It   Netflix, Crunchyroll    
The Medicine Seller, the protagonist of Mononoke, is an exorcist unlike any other, who differentiates himself through his distinct exorcism process. His technique, inspired by Japanese Buddhism, doesn’t allow him to simply confront the spirit directly without any preparation. Instead, he must first perform investigative work and carefully analyze his targets, learning about their Form, Truth, and Reason, before he can finally understand and defeat them. Although his process may be more complicated and involved than most, the extent of his efforts also tends to translate into a higher potential, as even the mightiest of malevolent spirits present no challenge to him.

While his ability to see Mushi could be considered a gift, it also comes with the unfortunate effect of constantly inevitably drawing Mushi to him, which is why he and others like him are always on the move, wandering around and rarely visiting the same places twice. Unlike most other exorcists, Ginko doesn’t perceive the Mushi as an evil to be destroyed; instead, he wants to help humans live in harmony with them.

The exorcists of Jujutsu Kaisen are known as Jujutsu Sorcerers, whom the Japanese government secretly trains to protect the population from cursed spirits. Not too dissimilar from the evil supernatural beings of other stories, curses are formed out of the negative emotions of normal humans, which build up over time and take form, resulting in a serious threat to humanity. Megumi Fushiguro is one of the sorcerers exorcising these spirits, coming from a long lineage of noble and powerful sorcerers. His combat style relies on shikigami, cursed spirits that he can summon after defeating them in battle. The shikigami&#39;s various abilities and strengths allow Megumi to be an extremely versatile and adaptable fighter, not to mention his remarkable tactical talent.
