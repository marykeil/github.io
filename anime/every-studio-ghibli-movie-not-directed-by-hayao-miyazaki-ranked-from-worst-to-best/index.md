## Literature Review

While Hayao Miyazaki is the biggest name from Studio Ghibli, he&#39;s far from their only director, and this is how all their other directors&#39; films rank.




While Hayao Miyazaki might be the biggest name associated with Studio Ghibli, he’s not the only director they’ve ever had. Ever since its founding, Studio Ghibli has produced films featuring a wide variety of directors, and even when Miyazaki isn’t involved, they usually end up staying true to the spirit of what makes Studio Ghibli so great.
Since its founding, Studio Ghibli has produced a total of 14 films not directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and there’s a definite hierarchy to their quality.
        

Some do a great job of maintaining the level of quality that’s associated with Studio Ghibli and are even able to surpass some of Miyazaki’s work on occasion, but others end up falling notably short in terms of story, characters, and even animation, at least by Studio Ghibli’s usual standards. Whatever the case, even the movies that didn’t work still show that Miyazaki isn’t responsible for everything at Studio Ghibli, and that fact adds even more depth to an already major name like theirs.

 14  Tales From Earthsea Might Be Studio Ghibli&#39;s Worst Movie Ever 
Goro Miyazaki&#39;s Tales From Earthsea
        

  Release Date   July 29, 2006    Director   Goro Miyazaki    Cast   Timothy Dalton, Matt Levin, Blaire Restaneo, Mariska Hargitay, Willem Dafoe    Runtime   115 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Goro Miyazaki’s Tales from Earthsea has an infamous reputation for being the worst Studio Ghibli film, and that reputation is unfrotunately highly warranted. The characters are completely void of depth, the film doesn&#39;t establish any stakes until over halfway through its run, and what few conflicts end up resolved are done so in utterly contrived ways that don’t make sense in the slightest. With all the fantasy action that tries to cover up a terrible script, Tales from Earthsea often feels like a parody of Studio Ghibli rather than a legitimate work, and that makes it hard to see it as anything other than one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s worst films.

 13  Earwig And The Witch Is Another Failure From Studio Ghibli 
Goro Miyazaki&#39;s Earwig And The Witch
        

  Release Date   December 30, 2020    Director   Goro Miyazaki    Cast   Taylor Paige Henderson, Vanessa Marshall, Richard E. Grant, Dan Stevens, Kacey Musgraves, JB Blanc    Runtime   82 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Equally infamous, and equally bad as Tales from Earthsea is Goro Miyazaki&#39;s Earwig and the Witch. The fact that Studio Ghibli would make a CGI film was odd on its own, but it never does anything interesting with its animation style, so it makes the change in animation style feel completely pointless. Worse still is how there&#39;s no semblance of a plot from start to finish, and not only does no one go through any growth over the ocurse of the film, but everyone is unlikable and impossible to root for. The only thing that puts Earwig and the Witch above Tales from Earthsea is its shorter runtime, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less painful to watch.

 12  Ocean Waves Completely Fails At Human Drama 
Tomomi Mochizuki&#39;s Ocean Waves
        

  Release Date   May 5, 1993    Director   Tomomi Mochizuki    Cast   Nobuo Tobita, Toshihiko Seki, Yoko Sakamoto    Runtime   72 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Tomomi Mochizuki&#39;s Ocean Waves was designed to give younger staff members at Studio Ghibli something to work on, and thatshows in its tragic lack of quality. Ocean Waves is supposed to be a romance story between Taku and Rikako, but they have little to no chemistry with each other, and have zero moments where they genuinely get along, something unintentionally emphasized in a tone-deaf montage at the end consisting entirely of moments of Rikako treating Taku poorly. The two of them are utterly insufferable as a couple and as individuals, especially Rikako, and it makes for one of the worst grounded stories in any Studio Ghibli film to date.

 11  The Secret World Of Arrietty Tells A Boring Story In A Fascinating World 
Hiromasa Yonebayashi&#39;s The Secret World Of Arrietty
        

  Release Date   July 17, 2010    Director   Hiromasa Yonebayashi    Cast   Bridgit Mendler, David Henrie, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Carol Burnett    Runtime   95 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Hiromasa Yonebayashi&#39;s The Secret World of Arrietty is one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s most visually interesting films, but its charming aesthetic is all it has going for it. Seeing all the ways that the Borrowers build their tiny world and interact with everything giant to them is always fun to watch, but the story is shallow, with very little plot and the characters have no significant development, with Arrietty being one of the least interesting protagonists in a Studio Ghibli film. Add the boring and incompetent villain in the film, and The Secret World of Arrietty ends up being a film with a lot of wasted potential.

 10  From Up On Poppy Hill Is A Fun Watch Until It Sabotages Its Story 
Goro Miyazaki&#39;s From Up On Poppy Hill
        

  Release Date   July 16, 2011    Director   Goro Miyazaki    Cast   Sarah Bolger, Anton Yelchin, Edie Mirman, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Noth    Runtime   92 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Goro Miyazaki’s From Up on Poppy Hill is another Studio Ghibli film that could have been much better than it ended up being. The first half of the film is a cute romcom between the leads with great writing, music, and animation, and there&#39;s very little to complain about. However, the second half suddenly introduces an odd plotline about the leads thinking they might be brother and sister, and it greatly detracts from what should have been a simple romance in favor of drama the film could have easily done without. From Up on Poppy Hill is Goro Miyazaki&#39;s best film to date, but unfortunately, doesn’t amount to much.

 9  Only Yesterday Doesn’t Live Up To Isao Takahata&#39;s Better Hits 
Isao Takahata&#39;s Only Yesterday
        

  Release Date   July 20, 1991    Director   Isao Takahata    Cast   Alison Fernandez, Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, Stephanie Sheh, Matthew Yang King    Runtime   118 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata is behind some of the studio&#39;s best films, but Isao Takahata&#39;s Only Yesterday unfortunately isn’t one of them. The parts of the film where Taeko is a child are always fun to watch and embody a lot of Takahata&#39;s innate charm as a director, but when Taeko is an adult, the film loses energy in both its story and its animation, and those sections always bring the film down. Studio Ghibli has made plenty of slice-of-life films, but Only Yesterday is nowhere near as engaging as its contemporaries, and it ends up being one of Takahata&#39;s weakest films as a result.

 8  The Cat Returns Fails To Honor The Beautiful Film It Spun Off From 
Hiroyuki Morita&#39;s The Cat Returns
        

  Release Date   July 20, 2002    Director   Hiroyuki Morita    Cast   Anne Hathaway, Cary Elwes, Peter Boyle, Tim Curry, Judy Greer    Runtime   75 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Hiroyuki Morita&#39;s The Cat Returns is a spinoff of Yoshifumi Kondo&#39;s Whisper of the Heart, but it unfortunately doesn&#39;t do a great job of living up to it. The film&#39;s unique art style helps it stand out against other Studio Ghibli films, as does the stellar fight choreography, but the story moves far too fast for any of the plot points to land, and it only ever moves forward from people, most notably Haru, doing nonsensical things for no reason, whatsoever. Even without comparing it to Whisper of a Heart, The Cat Returns simply doesn&#39;t have a lot going on with it, so it&#39;s hard to rank it that highly.

 7  My Neighbors the Yamadas Is Studio Ghibli&#39;s Weirdest Film &amp; One Of Their Best 
Isao Takahata&#39;s My Neighbors The Yamadas


 







  Release Date   July 17, 1999    Director   Isao Takahata    Cast   Jim Belushi, Molly Shannon, Daryl Sabara, Liliana Mumy, Tress MacNeille    Runtime   104 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Isao Takahata&#39;s My Neighbors the Yamadas is structured very differently from the rest of Studio Ghibli’s catalog, but it has a lot to offer. While the anthology format does make it harder to engage with the film compared to others, that does give it a uniqueness that helps it stand out, and it also helps that the titular Yamadas are all entertaining characters, regardless. Add in the unique art and animation style, and My Neighbors the Yamadas stands out as a Studio Ghibli film not directed by Hayao Miyazaki that gives the legendary director a run for his money.

 6  Pom Poko Is A Fun, Lighthearted Take On Studio Ghibli&#39;s Environmental Messages 
Isao Takahata&#39;s Pom Poko
        

  Release Date   July 16, 1994    Director   Isao Takahata    Cast   Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Clancy Brown, J.K. Simmons, Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche    Runtime   119 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
A common plot thread in Studio Ghibli films is an emphasis on the need to protect the environment, and Isao Takahata&#39;s Pom Poko has an excellent handling of that. The tanukis&#39; shapeshifting powers and likable personalities make every scene in the film fun to watch, and the pseudo-documentary format adds a bit of levity to the film in its efforts to discuss themes that could easily come off as overdone or melodramatic. The script doesn&#39;t have as tight a narrative as other Studio Ghibli films, but it&#39;s still a very fun movie to watch, and it warrants plenty of praise after so many years.

 5  The Red Turtle Is One Of Studio Ghibli&#39;s Most Inventive Films To Date 
Michaël Dudok de Wit&#39;s The Red Turtle
        

  Release Date   June 29, 2016    Director   Michaël Dudok de Wit    Runtime   80 Minutes    Where To Watch It   STARZ, Apple TV    
Michaël Dudok de Wit&#39;s The Red Turtle was Studio Ghibli&#39;s first co-production with Western studios, but that did nothing to keep it from being a great film. While the art and animation aren’t in Studio Ghibli&#39;s usual style, they&#39;re still plenty gorgeous, and the decision to have the story be told without any dialogue made for a truly unique experience that did nothing to detract from the overall tragedy of the story. The Red Turtle is a perfect example of how inventive animation can be with its storytelling, and it&#39;s a film that easily stands on par with some of Studio Ghibli&#39;s best.

 4  The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya Is A Masterclass In Animation &amp; Storytelling 
Isao Takahata&#39;s The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya


 







  Release Date   November 23, 2013    Director   Isao Takahata    Cast   Chloë Grace Moretz, Darren Criss, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Daniel Dae Kim    Runtime   137 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
Isao Takahata&#39;s The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was Takahata&#39;s last film before his passing in 2018, and it&#39;s easily one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s best. Takahata did an amazing job of using storybook-like art to create incredibly vivid animation, the scene of Kaguya running to the countryside being a particular standout, and even though the story is ultimately a tragedy, the stellar character writing does such an amazing job of selling the audience on the characters that it doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest. Princess Kaguya is easily one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s most stunning films to date, and it ended up being Takahata&#39;s perfect swan song.

 3  Grave Of The Fireflies Is One Of The Darkest Stories In Animation 
Isao Takahata&#39;s Grave Of The Fireflies
        

  Release Date   April 16, 1988    Director   Isao Takahata    Cast   Adam Gibbs, Emily Neves    Runtime   89 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Apple TV, Vudu    
Conversely, Isao Takahata&#39;s Grave of the Fireflies was his first film with Studio Ghibli, and its overwhelming quality is impossible to deny. The very first scene makes it clear that there won’t be a happy ending for the two leads, and the story of how that plays out is appropriately tragic, but just like with The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, the stellar writing and direction makes all of that bearable and doesn&#39;t detract from a great story that’s withstood the test of time. Grave of the Fireflies easily stands as Takahata&#39;s magnum opus, and it&#39;s easy to see it as one of the greatest anime films of all time.

 2  When Marnie Was There Perfectly Captures Studio Ghibli&#39;s Emotional Storytelling 
Hiromasa Yonebayashi&#39;s When Marnie Was There
        

  Release Date   July 19, 2014    Director   Hiromasa Yonebayashi    Cast   Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Autumn Bertman, John C. Reilly, Ellen Burstyn    Runtime   103 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
While The Secret World of Arrietty was largely forgettable, Hiromasa Yonebayashi&#39;s When Marnie Was There is anything but. In addition to having some of the best music and animation in any Studio Ghibli film, When Marnie Was There is a masterclass in character writing with how perfectly it depicts Anna&#39;s struggles with self-worth and how much her relationship with Marnie helps her learn to love herself. That sort of emotional writing is at the core of what makes Studio Ghibli films work, and When Marnie Was There&#39;s execution of it easily makes it one of their best films in years.

 1  Whisper Of The Heart Is Studio Ghibli&#39;s Underrated Masterpiece 
Yoshifumi Kondo&#39;s Whisper Of The Heart


 







  Release Date   July 15, 1995    Director   Yoshifumi Kondo    Cast   Brittany Snow, David Gallagher, Jean Smart, Cary Elwes    Runtime   111 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max    
The last Studio Ghibli film not directed by Hayao Miyazaki to discuss, and easily the best one, is Yoshifumi Kondo&#39;s Whisper of the Heart. In addition to having a story with far more emotional maturity than its contemporaries, Kondo’s stellar direction allows for some of the best shot composition and musical cues in any Studio Ghibli film to date. Add in the typically amazing animation of Studio Ghibli, and despite its lack of popularity, it ends up being one of their best films and perfect proof that Hayao Miyazaki isn’t the only one capable of making great films for Studio Ghibli.
