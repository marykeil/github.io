## Literature Review

Goku&#39;s mighty Super Saiyan 4 and Ultra Instinct Forms unlocked strength far beyond what was in Dragon Ball Z, but now fans know which one is stronger.





Storylines from the Super Dragon Ball Heroes series can be described as eccentric at best. Time travel, multiverses, and universe-threatening gods were all featured in Dragon Ball Super, but SDBH uses those plot devices to have fan-favorite characters from almost every DB franchise fight, even if the plot doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. The latest chapter, shared by SupaChronicles on X, ends with Goku&#39;s white haired Mastered Ultra Instinct from DBS overpowering Dragon Ball GT&#39;s Super Saiyan 4.





 Goku&#39;s Mastered Ultra Instinct Form Beats Super Saiyan 4 

 

After defeating the Demon Realm&#39;s Dark King Demigra, Xeno Goku (from DBGT&#39;s canon) and Goku (from DBS&#39;s canon) decided to have a friendly match between themselves. Chapter #20 sees the two begin with their Super Saiyan forms, then SS3, and they seem evenly matched until Goku raises to his red-haired Super Saiyan God form, forcing Xeno Goku to transform into SS4 in order to keep up. The two continue to match each other blow for blow until each launches their strongest Kamehameha attack toward the other, causing a humongous explosion.

The ultimate fight finally reaches its conclusion after SS4 Xeno Goku uses his Full Power Kamehameha Times Ten against Goku&#39;s Ultimate Instinct Kamehameha. After the explosion settles, SS4 rushes UI Goku, who then triggers his ultimate white-haired form, which punches Super Saiyan 4 once in the face, causing him to power down and admit defeat. Xeno Goku likely used too much energy in his Kamehameha attack, weakening him. At the same time, Goku&#39;s Ultra Instinct usually triggers after he&#39;s exhausted his energy once, which likely played a significant role in the results of the battle fans have wondered about for years.




          

Both of Dragon Ball Z&#39;s sequel series saw Goku unlocking powerful new forms whose strengths heavily outweighed anything that was seen in the popular 90s anime. Now, Goku fans know how Dragon Ball GT&#39;s primal SS4 form stacks up against Dragon Ball Super&#39;s godly form. While the events of Super Dragon Ball Heroes have no bearing on the active storyline of Dragon Ball Super, it&#39;s most likely the closest fans will get to finding out which of Goku&#39;s forms is the most powerful.
