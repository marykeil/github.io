## Literature Review

The isekai anime boom doesn&#39;t seem to stop, and Crunchyroll is the place to watch some of the genre&#39;s best series, both old classics and new gems.





The isekai boom seems neverending, and there are new series coming out each season, sometimes pushing the boundaries of the genre, sometimes just repeating the tropes that viewers are now very familiar with. There&#39;s something for all sorts of tastes when it comes to isekai stories, and here are the best ten series that can be watched on Crunchyroll.









 








 10  Sword Art Online 
        

Although the long-running Sword Art Online isn&#39;t the first isekai series, the anime&#39;s popularity and influence played a major role in starting the genre&#39;s boom in the mid-2010s. Conceptually, Sword Art Online is like a Fantasy version of The Matrix. The characters are trapped in a full-immersion virtual reality MMO by the game&#39;s creator and forced to reach the top floor of the in-game dungeon to escape. Dying in the game means dying in real life, so the stakes for the characters couldn&#39;t possibly be higher. It&#39;s an interesting twist on what is superficially a fairly standard Fantasy isekai setting.





 9  Fushigi Yugi 
        

Fushigi Yugi is worth watching for several reasons. Most notably, the series&#39; setting based on Ancient China is markedly different from the typical European-inspired settings of most isekai anime. The retro series is also a fascinating time capsule of mid-90s anime. The 90s art style and animation may feel a little dated three decades after the fact, but there&#39;s an undeniable charm to them. Following the high-schoolers Miaka and Yui as they are transported into the mythical world contained in a magic book, the plot rises to the level of a sprawling, epic war story with a huge cast of characters. Fushigi Yugi has won enough fans that is considered one of the best Isekai series of all time. It&#39;s a great anime series in its own right, but it&#39;s an especially good watch for anime fans nostalgic for the 90s and for younger fans who may be curious about classic anime.





 8  Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon 
        

An increasing number of isekai anime are making themselves stand out by putting new spins on the reincarnation premise. Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon easily stands out as one of the weirdest. The series is aware of how strange its premise is and fully commits to it. In the darkly humorous opening moments of the series, an anonymous vending machine aficionado is crushed to death in a tragic vending machine-related accident, and promptly finds himself reincarnated as a vending machine, the one piece of modern real-world technology in a standard Fantasy world. Much of the humor, especially in the early episodes, revolves around the Fantasy-genre characters being constantly bewildered by how exactly a vending machine works and gradually figuring it out through trial and error.





 7  So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? 
        

In a way, So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? is fundamentally a Slice of Life series. An explosion at a high school leads to a group of students being reincarnated in a Fantasy world. While most of these students are reincarnated as heroic adventurers, but the main character of the series is reincarnated as a low-level spider monster in one of the world&#39;s major dungeons. The early episodes of the series follow the protagonist, unofficially given the name Kumoko, as she struggles to survive daily life in a high-level dungeon where both the other monsters and the questing adventurers are constantly trying to kill her. The plot gets gradually darker and more intense as Kumoko levels up and gets stronger thanks to the numerous fierce battles she survives, going from a minor monster to a power boss-level character.





 6  Overlord 
        

Video game worlds are fairly common settings for isekai anime. More than a few Isekai protagonists have ended up inhabiting video games. In that regard, Overlord treads pretty familiar ground. In terms of its actual concept, however, Overlord turns the isekai genre on its head, by following the villains rather than the heroes. The main character Ainz is notable for being an intelligent and effective villain and is ruthless to his human enemies. On the other hand, he manages to remain a sympathetic main character due to genuinely caring about his minions. It&#39;s an interesting and quite compelling approach to the standard Fantasy Dark Lord archetype.





 5  Magic Knight Rayearth 
        

Roughly contemporary with Sailor Moon, Magic Knight Rayearth shares many similarities with the famous magical girl series, but it&#39;s set on a Fantasy world rather than on Earth. Like the heroines of Sailor Moon, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu are a team of transforming magical girls with elemental powers they use to fight evil. The twist for the three heroines of Magic Knight Rayearth is that they&#39;ve been transported to a Fantasy world called Cephiro. Like Sailor Moon, Magic Knight Rayearth has a few shockingly dark moments while maintaining an overall fairly whimsical tone and sense of humor. The isekai premise allows Magic Knight Rayearth to establish a unique identity compared to other magical girl series, giving the series more of an adventure aspect than other well-known Magical Girl series.





 4  The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated! 
        

The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated! is easily one of the best reverse isekai series in recent years. Most of the series&#39; fantastic sense of humor comes from seeing a stereotypical, over-the-top Fantasy villain like Jahy doing everyday things like hunting down deals on groceries or arguing about her rent and paychecks, while at the same time treating those mundane things, as well as her ongoing mission to restore the Dark Realm, with all the self-seriousness of an epic quest. For a series with a Dark Lord-type character as its main lead, it&#39;s incredibly relatable and surprisingly heartfelt. Jahy&#39;s cast of friends, most notably her Boss, are some of the nicest characters in anime and are an unwavering source of support through the many frustrations and vexations in Jahy&#39;s everyday life.





 3  The Rising of the Shield Hero 
        

The Rising of the Shield Hero&#39;s greatest strength is the unique tonal identity it has established for itself. Dark Fantasy is nothing new in itself when it comes to anime, but isekai series are fairly light-hearted adventure stories with comedic elements or outright parodies of the Fantasy genre. As a Dark Fantasy series, The Rising of Shield Hero is a welcome change of pace in the genre. While the dark and cynical tone may turn off some fans from the series, The Rising of Shield Hero is undeniably a clever spin on the isekai premise. After having his reputation unfairly ruined, Naofumi chooses to deliberately cultivate the image of an unscrupulous anti-hero for himself, making him much darker than the typical Fantasy hero.





 2  That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime 
        

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is probably the best example of an isekai series that balances seriousness and humor. For the most part, Rimuru&#39;s adventures and interactions with the other characters remain comedic, though there are some incredibly dark moments along the way and a fairly unflinching depiction of both Fantasy and real-world violence. Notably, one of the characters was reincarnated from the real world in the Fantasy world of the series due to being killed in the firebombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the bombing is unflinchingly depicted on-screen. These dark moments are uncommon and never feel gratuitous thanks to being immediately and importantly relevant to the plot and characters&#39; backstories.That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime takes itself exactly seriously enough without lapsing into either being too dark for its own good or becoming a parody of itself.





 1  KonoSuba 

        

KonoSuba has become one of the most beloved anime isekai series and it&#39;s not hard to see why. KonoSuba isn&#39;t just one of the funniest isekai anime, it&#39;s one of the funniest anime series overall. KonoSuba is a relentless parody of Fantasy RPG logic, using all the established tropes of the genre as the basis for jokes. The series&#39; sense of humor is phenomenal, the comedic timing is excellent, the contrast between the main cast&#39;s completely over-the-top personalities and the rest of the world taking itself seriously is fantastic, and even simple jokes like quick visual gags are executed brilliantly. It&#39;s a hilarious series, but the main characters still get their moments to shine, overcoming their superficially bad RPG stats by utilizing clever lateral thinking to win some impressive victories. With the long-awaited third season of KonoSuba scheduled to air in 2024, this is the best time to start or re-watch the series.
Crunchyroll&#39;s huge library will keep isekai fans busy for a long time. There are many excellent isekai series on offer, from nostalgic 90s classics to the most popular series currently airing. There are a lot of different sub-genres to choose from, so fans who are looking for a light-hearted escapist adventure or a dark and gritty world will both find them among the great isekai anime streaming on Crunchyroll.
