 What Time One Piece #1077 Releases 
          




One Piece episode #1077, titled &#34;The Curtain Falls! The Winner, Straw Hat Luffy!&#34; will air on Sunday, September 24 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on September 23 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, September 24 at 3:00 a.m. British Summer Time (BST) for One Piece fans in the UK. Fans of the English dub will have to wait for that version to premiere on Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Episode #1076 of One Piece? 
          

The biggest thing that happened in Episode #1076 was the epic conclusion of Luffy and Kaido&#39;s insanely long battle on the roof of Onigashima. Before Kaido was beaten by Luffy however, he had a flashback that revealed much of the enigmatic warlord&#39;s past. Disappointingly this backstory didn&#39;t dive too deep into many details fans have been waiting eagerly to see such as his time with the strong and enigmatic Rocks Pirates, but it still gave some great insight into Kaido&#39;s motivation and goals. In addition, the episode also featured Momo finally being able to create flame clouds to guide Onigashima away from the capital.






 One Piece Episode #1077 Will Give the Straw Hats a Much-Needed Break 
          

After the nonstop fighting that the Straw Hats have been doing for the entire Raid on Onigashima, they deserve a break from action for a while. Luckily the people of Wano will likely want to celebrate the defeat of their oppressors so the next episode will probably feature the Straw Hats joining in on the festivities. This will be especially good for Straw Hats like Zoro who were greatly injured in the battle and need time to recuperate. On a more serious note, with Orochi now having finally met his final fate, Momonosuke will likely step forward to claim his rightful place as the leader of Wano.

Beyond Wano itself, news of Kaido and Big Mom&#39;s defeat will probably receive some very dramatic reactions. This episode #1077 may also show how major figures like the 5 Elders, Akainu, and the other Yonko will respond to this major upheaval of the world&#39;s status quo. All of this promises to make One Piece episode #1077 a very exciting episode, even if it likely won&#39;t feature much fighting.




Catch One Piece episode #1077 when it releases on Crunchyroll on September 24, 2023.
