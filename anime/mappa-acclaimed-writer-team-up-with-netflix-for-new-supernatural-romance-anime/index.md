## Literature Review

Maboroshi is the latest directorial work by Mari Okada; between her and MAPPA&#39;s animation, Netflix seems to have another winner locked in for January.




Streaming service Netflix revealed that it will premiere Maboroshi, an animated film that is directed by acclaimed creative Mari Okada and animated by MAPPA. Both are already big names in the anime industry, so it goes without saying that audiences will be rushing to watch the result of this dream team. The wait won&#39;t be long, either, with the movie arriving on January 15.




Mari Okada is a very prolific writer and director, so it makes sense that Netflix would want to get something exclusive from her work. The idea of a supernaturally forbidden love story might not be the most groundbreaking idea, but between Okada&#39;s experience and MAPPA&#39;s expertise, there is no doubt that Maboroshi will be worth checking out.


 

It seems that 2024 will continue to be packed with ever more high-profile anime, as Maboroshi will join other hot series announced, such as Dandadan, Solo Leveling, and season 2 of Oshi no Ko.

Netflix&#39;s trailer comes with a synopsis in its description, which lays down the premise of the movie:


Fourteen-year-old Masamune lives in a town where the flow of time has stopped after an explosion at a steel factory seals off all avenues of escape. In hopes that everything will someday return to normal, the town makes a rule that nothing must be changed, and Masamune spends his days in depression. One day, his intriguing and enigmatic classmate Mutsumi leads him into a blast furnace at the steel factory. There, he finds Itsumi, a girl who cannot speak and acts like a wild wolf. Masamune&#39;s encounter with these two girls begins eroding the balance of the world. What future awaits the unstoppable urge to fall in love?


Romances in anime films are pretty popular these days, especially since Makoto Shinkai&#39;s Your Name and Weathering With You created an expectation for sumptuous visuals that can complement the emotional stakes a couple might have, ones that conveniently have apocalyptic consequences. The same can be said here, with MAPPA just making the imagery a little more obvious, as glowing cracks in the environment - and on victims - show the threat the town lives in the shadow of. There is no doubt that even with the familiar formula, Mari Okada will be more than familiar with how to twist a viewer&#39;s heartstrings.




Mari Okada&#39;s made a name for herself since her debut work, DT Eightron, in 1998. Since then, she&#39;s written for a wide variety of anime, ranging from Basilisk to Rozen Maiden to A Whisker Away, many of which have gone on to be held in high regard by critics. Maboroshi will be the second film she&#39;s directed, with her first being Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms in 2018. Despite her prolific writing, the five-year difference between directorial roles makes Maboroshi noteworthy. Netflix will easily get an audience from those just wanting to see how Okada handles her second movie.

Supernaturally isolated locations and romances with mysterious girls are time-honored plot devices. Netflix even released Bubble in 2022, which broadly echoes Maboroshi&#39;s setup, though its themes skewed far more towards science fiction, and the scenes are more focused on action. Netflix&#39;s trailer for Maboroshi, which focuses much more on drama and emotion, shows that even between the movies there are enough differences in intent, even if it is treading familiar ground. Audiences will likely be more than ready to receive Maboroshi when it makes its debut on Netflix on January 15, 2024.
