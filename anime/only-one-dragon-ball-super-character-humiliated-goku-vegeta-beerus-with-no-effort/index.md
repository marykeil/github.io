# Only One Dragon Ball Super Character Humiliated Goku, Vegeta, &amp; Beerus With No Effort


## SUMMARY 



  Arale, a character from a previous work by Akira Toriyama, is the most powerful character in Dragon Ball Super.   Arale defeats Goku and Vegeta with ease, displaying absurd power and abilities.   Despite Arale&#39;s immense strength, she is considered a joke character and is not taken seriously by Vegeta or Goku.

## Literature Review

One episode of Dragon Ball Super featured a character who easily showed up the series&#39; most powerful figures, and it&#39;s someone you&#39;d least expect.




When fans think of the most powerful characters in Dragon Ball Super, their mind is likely to go to Goku, or Vegeta, or literal god Beerus, but there&#39;s one character in the anime adaptation who successfully dunked on all of them. This character happens to be from one of Akira Toriyama&#39;s previous works: Arale of Dr. Slump.




In the Dragon Ball Super episode entitled &#34;Goku vs. Arale! An Off-the-Wall Battle Spells the End of the Earth?&#34;, the character of Arale makes an appearance. Despite looking like a fairly ordinary little girl, Arale is in fact a super-powered android with some phenomenal abilities at her disposal. Arale is generally the good-natured sort, however, so despite her power, she&#39;s not much of a risk to the Earth.

          

In the episode, she is slipped a drug which increases their desire &#34;to play&#34; by a hundred-fold, making her far more destructive than she usually is. That&#39;s when Vegeta has to step in to calm her down... or at least, try to.

Arale immediately throws Vegeta through a wall, shocking Goku who was relaxing on the other side. Vegeta complains that she&#39;s a &#34;gag character&#34; with absurd power at her disposal. When Vegeta powers up and does land a hit, he hits Arale hard enough that she flies around the world in just a few seconds and hits him from behind, leaving her unharmed. Vegeta even manages to knock her head off, but even that doesn&#39;t slow her down for long. She takes out Vegeta with a headbutt, then turns her attention to Goku. Goku doesn&#39;t fair much better, despite ascending to Super Saiyan Blue and attempting to pull off a God Kamehameha, which she effortlessly deflects.

However, rough-housing with Goku starts to go too far, as Arale prepares an attack 100 times as powerful as the previous; they attempt to call Beerus in for help, and he eventually shows up, only to get a stomach ache and be forced to retreat. Goku and friends never actually defeat Arale, but rather the drug wears off, and she returns to normal. Obviously, as Vegeta noted, Arale is a joke character who operates based on what would be funniest, and seeing Goku and Vegeta get wrecked by this little girl is definitely amusing. Vegeta is especially disgusted with the whole ordeal, swearing never to battle a character from an 80s gag manga ever again.






 Arale is Earth&#39;s Most Powerful? 
          

Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball have crossed over before, so Arale was an established part of Dragon Ball lore prior to this episode, which is only present in the anime. It does raise some questions as to why they&#39;ve never tried to get Arale&#39;s help defeating villains before, but in the end Arale isn&#39;t a fighter, so it doesn&#39;t make much sense to call her out against opponents like Frieza. Still, none of that changes the fact that she was capable of going a hundred times beyond the level of Super Saiyan Blue, making her indisputably the strongest non-divine character in Dragon Ball Super--but only if it&#39;s funny.
