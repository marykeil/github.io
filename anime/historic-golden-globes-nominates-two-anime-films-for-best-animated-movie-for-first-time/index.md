The award ceremony is a day to honor the biggest and best movies, series, and people involved in a gathering that sees the most important people in the entertainment industry all in one place.




Although anime has become huge globally, the Golden Globes nominations haven&#39;t reflected that with many masterpieces being passed up and snubbed for an award. Only two movies, namely Masaaki Yuasa&#39;s Inu Oh and Mamoru Hosada&#39;s Mirai, were ever nominated for the Best Animated Film award prior to 2023.


 

Now, the Golden Globes&#39; official X account confirmed that Makoto Shinkai&#39;s Suzume and Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s The Boy and The Heron have both been nominated for Golden Globe&#39;s Best Animated Film in a historical moment that recognizes anime&#39;s appeal and its potential.

This is the first time in the award&#39;s history that 2 anime were nominated in a year, showing just how big of a stride the medium has made on its way to global popularity.

These two movies are, surprisingly, one of the most successful works for both directors, highlighting how progressively accepted anime has been internationally in the course of their careers.




         

The competition is stiff, with other animated movies like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse which are masterpieces in their own right, being nominated. Nonetheless, this is still great news, and it is heightened by the fact that both movies have a great shot of winning the award. Regardless of how much weight one gives The Golden Globes&#39; nominations, the gripping stories and fantastic art styles of Suzume and The Boy and the Heron make them fantastic pieces of art.
