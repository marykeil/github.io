## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s latest chapter reveals a shocking twist that could permanently alter the very fundamentals of its most important power system.





Summary

  Devil fruits can potentially grant their powers without the need for direct consumption, raising questions about One Piece&#39;s original power system.   Bonney&#39;s powers were given to her by Saturn, who fed her extracts of the fruit when she was an infant.   The workings of devil fruits may be more intricate than presumed, as seen with Vegapunk&#39;s experiments and characters like Blackbeard and Big Mom.  







One Piece just possibly changed its most important power system, devil fruits, and this could be the key to several of the series&#39; biggest mysteries. As one of the simpler anime power systems, One Piece&#39;s devil fruits work within set rules, thus remaining somewhat consistent over time despite new additions to the lore. That said, the latest chapter of One Piece could end up permanently altering the understanding of devil fruits forever.

Chapter #1103 of One Piece reveals Saturn gave Bonney her devil fruit when she was an infant. The chapter reveals that Bonney never directly ate her devil fruit herself but was given extracts of the fruit before she could even chew, as part of a cruel experiment. 

          

These unique circumstances under which Bonney received her powers suggest fans could be completely mistaken about the conditions needed to obtain devil fruit powers, raising interesting questions about the very fundamentals of the power system. The most significant question raised is whether one needs to consume the fruit to acquire the power at all, which ties in with many of One Piece&#39;s other dubiously acquired devil fruits.




                  One Piece Reveals The Deadly Potential Of A Mysterious Devil Fruit   One Piece contains several Devil Fruits powers that can devastate foes with a single touch, but Jewelry Bonney&#39;s just got a lot more brutal.   


 Devil Fruits Need Not Be Directly Eaten 
          

Seeing as Bonney never directly ate her powerful devil fruit, it seems it might be possible to gain a devil fruit&#39;s power without directly eating the fruit itself. That is, as long as its essence enters the body in some form or another. That said, the chapter does not explain why the devil fruit ability didn&#39;t manifest in Bonney until over five years later. All that is clear is that the mysterious Sapphire Scale disease that took away Ginny&#39;s life and nearly stole Bonney&#39;s was a side effect of this cruel experimentation.




Having said that, Bonney&#39;s case is hardly the first of its kind, a prime example being Big Mom, who also mysteriously acquired her powers without a fruit in sight, spawning countless theories on the subject, especially centered around cannibalism. Blackbeard also stole Whitebeard&#39;s devil fruit through mysterious means, which could be connected to this revelation. Seeing as Vegapunk has managed to feed devil fruits to inanimate objects and even replicate countless devil fruit powers using the user&#39;s lineage factor, the workings of devil fruits may be far more intricate than presumed.

          

Either way, it appears that One Piece&#39;s power system may be changing for good as the Final Saga approaches. With many major characters making their move at long last and the introduction of some of the strongest devil fruits to date, it is likely that devil fruits will only continue to grow in prominence as One Piece moves forward, becoming all the more elaborate in the process.
