# Dragon Ball Z s Highest Recorded Power-Level Could Be Daima s Secret Villain


## SUMMARY 



  Dragon Ball DAIMA will feature familiar characters like Goku and the rest of the cast, who have been turned into children.   The trailer suggests a connection between the new villain and the Buu Saga, possibly indicating the return of Dabura, the King of the Demon Realm, who had the highest power level officially recorded in Dragon Ball Z.   There may be a link between the new villain and Babidi, indicating a potential back-up plan or a new relative of Babidi being involved in the storyline.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Daima&#39;s big villain may turn out to be a familiar yet powerful face from the Buu Saga, one who remains the highest power level recorded.




The upcoming series Dragon Ball DAIMA hasn&#39;t revealed too many details about its story yet, but there&#39;s a solid chance that fans have already met the villain of the new series, and he&#39;s a familiar face who holds the title of highest recorded power level in the entire franchise: Dabura, the King of the Demon Realm.




Dragon Ball DAIMA is the recently announced new series in the franchise that will star Goku and the rest of the cast, who have been reverted to children. It&#39;s not clear yet exactly what has caused Goku and friends to become children again, but it is obvious that this will be the catalyst for the plot of DAIMA, and that it&#39;s not going to be resolved easily.

          

The trailer for Daima also features images of what appears to be a castle in a hellish realm, and some footage from the Buu Saga being played on a screen by a new character (who looks quite villainous). That raises a big question of what may be the connection between this new villain and the characters from the Buu Saga.


 Dragon Ball DAIMA&#39;s New Big Villain Could Be Dabura 
          




As it turns out, there&#39;s a character closely associated with Hell who had a fairly large role to play in the beginning of the Buu Saga: Dabura. Dabura is the King of the Demon Realm, and boasts the highest recorded power level in the series. Demons in Dragon Ball use a separate power level system called Kili. According to Shonen Jump, 1 Kili = 50,000 Power Levels. Dabura&#39;s Kili is 4000, meaning his power level is a whopping 200 Million. While other villains like Buu himself or Jiren certainly would score higher, they&#39;ve never actually had their power levels revealed. As a demon king, Dabura is a master of magic, like the kind that might be needed to turn Goku and friends into children. There&#39;s even a shot of a being who resembles (or may be) Babidi, Dabura&#39;s former master, in the DAIMA trailer.

Dabura was defeated by Buu, and thus never really got a full-strength showdown with Goku or the other Z-Fighters. In anime filler episodes, Dabura was shown to have repented in Heaven and even helped Chi Chi, Bulma, and Videl search for Gohan, but these filler episodes are generally not considered to be canon, so they don&#39;t prohibit Dabura from showing up again as an evil villain. Dabura likely wouldn&#39;t be interested in avenging Babidi or attempting to use Majin Buu again, but there could be all kinds of other reasons why he would return, and other Dragon Ball media, such as games, have brought Dabura back before.






 Dabura Is An Interesting But Undedeveloped Villain 
          

While Dabura has this interesting record of having the highest power level officially recorded in Dragon Ball Z, he was quickly outclassed by the other villains and heroes. Still, he was an interesting character who could be developed more, especially considering his ties to the still-mysterious Demon Realm. At the very least, there seems to be some connection between the new villain seen in Daima&#39;s trailer and Babidi, given the latter&#39;s otherwise unexplained presence in the trailer, and Dabura could be that missing link. Dragon Ball DAIMA seems to have some strong connection to the Buu saga, and bringing back Dabura, who never got a proper fight (besides a brief bout with Gohan), might be a great way to tie in the new series with what came before.




               Dragon Ball   Summary:   From the creative mind of Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is a mega multimedia franchise that spans back to the 1980s. Dragon Ball expanded quickly, starting as a serialized manga for Weekly Shonen Jump in Japan. It made its way overseas via manga and an anime adaptation that is enjoyed worldwide. Dragon Ball was the initial starting animated series that followed the adventures of the young Son Goku as he sought after the Dragon Balls. These mystical orbs would grant the wish of any who gathered them together. Then, the series would branch off into the immensely popular Dragon Ball Z, which followed Goku as an adult and featured high-intensity battles and Goku&#39;s never-ending search to be the strongest. The series has also enjoyed several popular video game adaptations and continues to release several new animated series and theatrical films up to the recent popular Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.
