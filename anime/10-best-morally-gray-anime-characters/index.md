# 10 Best Morally Gray Anime Characters


## SUMMARY

 Some of theme morally ambiguous characters are driven to a specific goal, but their methods are questionable as they won&#39;t stop at nothing to achieve it.

## Literature Review

Rather than going down some predetermined path of pure evil or boundless kindness, these characters stick to their own rules and make their own paths.




The best morally gray anime characters remind viewers that the world is not always black and white. While most characters are justice-driven symbols of peace, acting heroically to save the world, or evil villains seeking nothing but to cause as much destruction as possible, the most memorable anime characters stand between those two extremes.
Perhaps they adhere to a strict set of morals that simply doesn’t match up with what others would expect from a hero or a villain, or they lack any principles whatsoever, acting purely out of pleasure and seeking self-gratification above all else. Either way, their vague nature typically makes them more interesting, as opposed to the ones who are absolutely good or evil.

Black Lagoon’s female protagonist, Revy, is a polarizing and compelling character. Having been raised in a tough environment, wherein she suffered both physical and sexual abuse, she grew to hate her own powerlessness. She also values money above all else, as she is aware of just how difficult and unfair life can be for the underprivileged. This is what set her down the path of a mercenary. As a member of the Lagoon Company, Revy is known as the competitive, loud, and impatient one, often resorting to violence with no hesitation. However, she can also be kind and protective towards those she cares about, such as Rock.

Based on the Manga By Kagiji Kumanomata


 







  Release Year   2020    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   Funimation, Crunchyroll    
As a laid-back slice-of-life anime, Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle doesn’t involve the scale or gravitas of some other stories. However, that doesn’t exclude Princess Syalis from her rightful description as a morally ambiguous character. Abducted by the Demon Lord, most would spend their days terrified and impatient to be saved, but Syalis is different. Instead, she sees this as an opportunity to rest, and she makes it her single goal to ensure her sleep is as comfortable as possible. To this end, she will slaughter and steal from any of the castle’s inhabitants, but she also manages to help and befriend some of them eventually.





 7  Menou (The Executioner and Her Way of Life) 
Based on the Light Novel By Mato Satou &amp; Nilitsu
        

  Release Year   2022    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   HIDIVE    
In most isekai titles, characters who are summoned to another world end up receiving benefits and powers that they would otherwise never be privy to, enjoying their lives in magical kingdoms full of new possibilities. Completely subverting this trope, in The Executioner and Her Way of Life, such otherworlders are branded as “Lost Ones” and doomed to be executed, as they pose too great a risk to be left alone. The protagonist Menou is simultaneously a compassionate priestess as well as a ruthless assassin tasked with preventing another great catastrophe. She may not derive any pleasure from her mission, but she’s aware of its importance nonetheless.

  Release Year   2017    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream It   Netflix, Funimation, Crunchyroll    
Classroom Of The Elite’s Kiyotaka Ayanokoji is an inconspicuous character who typically blends in with the crowd, unwilling to stand out or attract unnecessary attention. To this end, he chooses to remain in the D-class, despite having the necessary intelligence and aptitudes to join the A-class, which is reserved for only the most gifted of students. This conflicting nature further reflects in his behavior and attitude towards other people. On certain occasions, he appears to be genuinely friendly and willing to help others, but most of the time, he is not above lying, deceiving, and manipulating people if it benefits him in any way.





 5  Elaina (Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina) 
Based on the Light Novel By Jougi Shiraishi &amp; Azure


 







  Release Year   2020    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   Netflix, Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina’s titular protagonist Elaina is a genuinely selfish and conceited character who refuses to interfere with most other people’s fates, even when she’s aware of what grim situations they are to endure without her help. As she travels from place to place, she comes across a variety of situations, always remaining passive to anything that happens. As she neither assists nor directly harms anyone, she could be considered the quintessential neutral character. Refusing to become either a hero or a villain, she pays no mind to others, as she values nothing but her own enjoyment in life.





 4  Decim (Death Parade) 
Original Anime Created By Yuzuru Tachikawa
        

  Release Year   2015    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   Netflix, Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu    
As the titular bartender of Quindecim and the protagonist of Death Parade, Decim was designed to be morally ambiguous. His bar is where two people who have died at the same time go, waiting for their fates to be judged, and he is the arbiter who decides whether their souls are to be reincarnated or lost to the Void forever. Committed to his role as an arbiter, Decim always does his best to understand and care for his guests, even though he lacks an understanding of human emotions. However, he does not take upon himself the duty of either saving or dooming anyone, but merely passes down judgment as he sees fit.





 3  Ken Kaneki (Tokyo Ghoul) 
Based on the Manga By Sui Ishida

Tokyo Ghoul’s Ken Kaneki is a complex and controversial character whose personality and attitude evolve drastically throughout the runtime of the series. Initially, he appears to be a gentle and reserved person, who would go to any length to protect those dear to him, even if it meant he had to be punished for actions that he didn’t commit. Even after becoming a half-ghoul, he maintained his compassionate and self-sacrificing nature. However, his attitude started to change after he was captured and tortured. He remained equally kind to his friends, but became crueler and more violent toward his enemies, eventually losing sight of who he wanted to be.

 2  Koko Hekmatyar (Jormungand) 
Based on the Manga By Keitarou Takahashi
        

  Release Year   2012    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu    
As the protagonist of Jormungand, Koko Hekmatyar is a character whose noble goal is only obscured by her immoral plan. The titular “Jormungand” is a secret project that she developed along with her best friend Minami Amada, aiming to end war and arms trade completely. While this may sound positive on paper, the issue is that her methods involve the use of a complex network of satellites and quantum computers that would completely prevent air travel, and eventually sea and land travel as well if needed. Even while knowing that 700.000 people may die upon Jormungand’s activation, Koko considers these casualties insignificant when compared to what she hopes to achieve, world peace.





 1  Lady Eboshi (Princess Mononoke) 
Original Anime Created By Hayao Miyazaki
        

  Release Year   1997    Number of Episodes   1 movie    Where to Stream It   Netflix    
Some characters are considered to be morally ambiguous because they cannot be viewed as either a hero or a villain. Lady Eboshi is different in that regard, as she falls under both categories at the same time, with the only deciding variable being one’s perspective. To the people of Irontown, she is a strong and respectable leader who saved them, gave them freedom, and allowed them to live fulfilling lives. But to the spirits of nature and those aligned with it, such as Princess Mononoke herself, San, she is a villain threatening the peace and natural order of the world, whose actions cause great suffering. Ultimately, it&#39;s up to the viewer to decide how to judge Lady Eboshi&#39;s actions.
These characters may be considered morally gray only due to the worlds they live in, wherein they manage to find favor with certain factions only to be detested by others. In other cases, it’s simply their undecided nature that qualifies them for such a description, as they are too self-absorbed or uninterested in others to concern themselves with what their peers consider good or bad. Whether their goals or methods are questionable, or it’s their personality that doesn’t fit into certain expectations, the best morally gray anime characters are certainly some of the most complex and memorable ones as well.
