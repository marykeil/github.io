# Jujutsu Kaisen Ruined Its Coolest Death With One Big Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  Yuki&#39;s death in Jujutsu Kaisen was disappointing because her sacrifice ultimately had no effect.   Yuki had the potential to be one of the best characters in the series due to her power, cool cursed technique, and connections to other characters, but her death squandered that potential.   The dissonance between the visually impressive black hole moment and the lack of significance and emotional resonance in Yuki&#39;s death makes it even more disappointing and ruins its impact.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen is no stranger to brutally killing off its characters in awesome ways, but the manga just squandered the potential of its latest death.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Chapters 208 and 236!Many fans have been disappointed with some of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s latest deaths, but none can compare to the one that should have been the series&#39; coolest, but instead was its most disappointing. Series author Gege Akutami has never been afraid of killing off his characters, but normally their deaths are emotionally resonant or serve some greater purpose in the story. Yuki Tsukumo&#39;s death could have easily been this way as well, but unfortunately, it was the opposite.




In Chapter 208, Yuki&#39;s fight with Kenjaku comes to an end in a spectacular fashion. Already on the verge of death from a devastating wound Kenjaku inflicted on her before, Yuki decides to sacrifice herself to take the evil sorcerer down. She grabs onto him and then uses her cursed technique to increase her mass to such magnitudes that she becomes a black hole, annihilating everything around her. While this is visually very impressive, it ultimately is surprisingly ineffective as Kenjaku just uses his antigravity technique to avoid the black hole&#39;s effects. This makes Yuki&#39;s sacrifice ultimately pointless, which is a shame as she was criminally underutilized for how potentially cool she could have been.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Finally Reveals the Abilities of Its Last Great Sorcerer   After establishing the strength of its top fighters, Jujutsu Kaisen finally reveals the abilities of its last Special Grade Sorcerers Yuki Tsukumo.   


 Yuki&#39;s Death Was Ruined by How Pointless It Was 
          




Yuki Tsukumo was one of the few sorcerers in Jujutsu Kaisen to earn the rank of Special Grade, which means that she is powerful enough to single-handedly overthrow a country. She also had close ties to various other characters in the series, being Gojo and Geto&#39;s friend as well as being Todo&#39;s mentor. Her cursed technique, which was only revealed a few chapters before her death, was also incredibly cool, enabling her to manipulate the mass of both herself and her cursed tool Garuda. All this coupled with her extreme personality made Yuki have the potential to be one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s best characters, but her pointless death squandered that.

Given how little readers got to see Yuki before she died, her death lacks the emotional resonance that other major deaths like Nobara&#39;s had. And given that Kenjaku managed to survive her last desperate attack, her death doesn&#39;t even have any real significance for the plot. At the same time, her black hole was one of the coolest-looking moments of the series, taking up a full two pages of devastation and warping even the manga’s speech bubbles. This dissonance between how cool it looked and how pointless it was makes it even more disappointing, utterly ruining any impact it could have otherwise had on the reader.






 Has Jujutsu Kaisen Improved In Depicting Deaths? 
          

The most controversial recent death in the series is Gojo&#39;s demise at the hands of Sukuna, which many fans found disappointing. However, the fight leading up to that death was incredibly satisfying and while the outcome may have been a shock, it was also based on techniques fans already knew Sukuna had access to. It also took a real toll on Sukuna, which will affect him for the rest of the fight. These factors make Gojo&#39;s death much better than Yuki&#39;s unfortunate end and is hopefully a sign that Gege has learned from their past mistakes ahead of the many deaths that will likely occur before Sukuna is defeated.

The one good thing about Yuki&#39;s death is that it shows how incredibly powerful Kenjaku is in Jujutsu Kaisen while eliminating a potential threat to him. But as the end of Hakari’s fight with Kashimo proves, a character doesn’t need to die to reduce their power level. Hopefully, Jujutsu Kaisen will take its remaining powerful characters in more interesting directions as the series nears its conclusion and avoid any more flashy but ultimately pointless deaths.




Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 208 is available to read from Viz Media.
