## Literature Review

As some of anime&#39;s most iconic titles, high-stakes survival games always serve to show the worst of what humanity has to offer when desperate.





As the name implies, the one commonality of these shows is how they all revolve around dangerous, high-stakes games of survival. Most participants are also brought into these environments unwillingly, sometimes even serving as entertainment for others. Regardless of their circumstances, motivations, or views on violence though, no one can stand idle when their safety and survival are put on the line.

 10  Btooom! 
        

Btooom! is the namesake of a fictional video game recreated in the real world, with the unwilling participants being stranded on a remote island where their only apparent key to escape is taking each other out with bombs and winning the game. As the rules and items are mostly the same as in the videogame, top player Ryouta Sakamoto should have an advantage, but he quickly finds out that real life is far less convenient than what he is used to. Luckily, he is not alone, as he soon meets and teams up with Himiko, with the goal of escaping the island together.





 9  Deadman Wonderland 
        

The titular Deadman Wonderland is a prison where the most dangerous of convicts are forced to fight each other to the death, all for the amusement of onlookers. As the sole survivor of a massacre of his entire classroom, Ganta Igarashi is framed for the carnage and sentenced to die. This is but the beginning of a series of strange incidents and mysteries, as he soon comes across an enigmatic girl named Shiro, who seems to know him, and eventually learns that he has the ability to control his own blood. Determined to find the true culprit and clear his name, Ganta has no choice but to struggle to survive.

 8  Death Parade 
        

What comes after death is a question that many have asked, and though its answer may remain forever out of reach, Death Parade presents viewers with an interesting possibility. Here, two people who die at the same time are sent neither to hell nor to heaven, but rather to a mysterious place where they are forced to participate in a high-stakes game. The winners are said to be reincarnated, while the souls of the losers are lost forever. However, the truth is that arbiters such as Decim make their decisions based on criteria other than the apparent rules of the games they present.





 7  Tomodachi Game 
        

While it may not be categorized as a death game per se, given that sudden death is never the outcome or consequence of the games, the stakes in Tomodachi Game are just as high as those of any other entry on this list, making it more of a reinvention of the theme. Here, a mysterious host known as Manabu-kun presents psychological games that test the trust and friendship of different friend groups, repeatedly testing just how much they know about each other and how much they value their interpersonal bonds. No one is ever killed, but the psychological scars they are left with are enough to ruin their lives or drive them to desperation.





 6  Danganronpa: The Animation 
        

The events of Danganronpa: The Animation take place in a prestigious high school where not only graduation, but even survival is far from guaranteed. Fifteen elite students find themselves trapped in the academy, with their mysterious teddy bear principal Monokuma telling them that the only way to escape is to kill a classmate without being caught. A series of assassinations and investigations ensues, with each student making use of their special skills and knowledge to seek victory at all costs. This is truly a high-stakes game, where no one can be trusted and no information should be taken at face value.





 5  Magical Girl Raising Project 
        

Magical Girl Raising Project is a social game that allows a small percentage of its players to achieve their dreams of becoming real magical girls. When Koyuki Himekawa receives a notification telling her she has been selected to become a magical girl, her luck seems to change for the better. However, all of that changes when she receives yet another notification, according to which the number of magical girls in her district must be halved. She and the other girls are now forced to participate in a dangerous survival game, whose rules and consequences become increasingly more twisted and horrifying as the game goes on.

 4  Darwin&#39;s Game 
        

While it may seem like an ordinary mobile application at first glance, everyone who downloads and opens Darwin&#39;s Game involuntarily signs up to participate in a brutal death game, forced to risk their lives and hunt other players down. Moreover, every player receives a sigil, a randomized unique ability that they may use during the game, ranging from stealth and teleportation to telekinesis and even seeing the future. The outcome of battles determines whether points are gained or lost, with the winners being able to convert their points into significant sums of money, and those who lose all their points dying.





 3  Fate/Zero 
        

Fate/Zero revolves around the Holy Grail War, a brutal death battle whose winner is said to be able to make any wish come true. However, these wars are so cruel that no one was left standing in the past, though that won&#39;t stop other participants from pursuing their own goals. The current game of survival involves seven players, each fighting alongside a powerful familiar inspired by ancient legends and mythology. One such player is Kiritsugu Emiya, who joins as part of a contract with the Einzbern family, summoning Saber and controlling her to take out other servants and defeat anyone standing in their way.





 2  Future Diary 
        

Perhaps the single most popular show of its type, Future Diary may as well be synonymous with the death game theme in anime. The title revolves around a mysterious battle royale, wherein 12 players are granted specific Future Diaries, which give them information about the past, present, and future of other participants, typically with the aim of using this information to take others out while defending themselves from any assailants. After finding himself caught up in this survival game at the whims of a deity, Yukiteru Amano has no choice but to team up with Yuno Gasai and ensure his survival at any cost.





 1  Gantz 
        

In the world of Gantz, death is not an end, but rather a beginning. People who die, like Kei Kurono, unexpectedly find themselves brought back to life in perfectly healthy bodies, forced to participate in arbitrary missions and take out aliens. Though they may already have died once, that doesn&#39;t mean that the worst has passed; unspeakable fates await those who participate in such games, with their skills and morals constantly being tested. Gore and violence may be common in such high-stakes games, but Gantz takes that to a different level, boldly emphasizing the cruel and ruthless potential of humanity.
These types of shows may seem to have obscure cult followings at best, but the truth is that such high-stakes games often have a lot of unique characteristics beyond their morbid premise. When characters who are used to safe and comfortable lives suddenly have to face their own potential demise, the worst of humanity is put on display. There is no longer any room for fake emotions and feigned innocence in these environments, because no one can be trusted and any mistake can be fatal. This is what makes the best death game anime particularly enjoyable.
