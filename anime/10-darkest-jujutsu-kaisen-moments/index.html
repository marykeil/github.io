<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Jujutsu Kaisen might be known as a dark fantasy, but some scenes are so disturbingly dark, that they will shock even the most jaded of its fans.</p>
<p>In a series like Jujutsu Kaisen, which blends fantasy with the macabre, and the supernatural with horror, darkness is fundamental. However, even in a story where darkness is the rule, there are some moments where the depravity of the characters stands out as significantly greater than the baseline macabre content that fans have come to expect.
While there are plenty of happy, funny, and joyous moments in the series, from the very start of the story, mangaka Gege Akutami made it clear that he would never shy away from taking the characters to the most grim and sinister places. While many of these bleak situations might have been called for as part of the storyline, they were nevertheless hard to see. Moreover, in perfect Gege fashion, more than a few of these dark moments happened unexpectedly, catching the fans completely off their guard, and making the effect of the moment even more horrible.</p>
<p>10  Ogi Zenin Fights His Daughters Maki and Mai, And Leaves Them For Dead
Chapter 149: &ldquo;Perfect Preparation, Part 2&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clans in Jujutsu Kaisen are not necessarily the familial source of support they should be. Most clans in the story suffer from some form of dysfunction – and nowhere is this more evident than in the Zenin Clan. As one of the three most powerful families, clan rules and traditions can be harsh, as they were for Maki and Mai – twins, which split the cursed energy between them, which made them both less powerful than if they were a single person. It also made the twins an object of revulsion to other clan members, including their parents. When a conflict within the clan gave senior members a chance to kill them off, Ogi Zenin, Maki and Mai’s father, jumped at the chance. With neither able to draw on the full force of their powers, Ogi brutally between them and left them to die in pools of their own blood.</p>
<p>9  The Death Of Yorozu
Chapter 219: &ldquo;Bath, Part 4&rdquo;</p>
<p>It’s clear that if Sukuna learned anything from sharing an existence with Yuji, it was that having a vessel with a strong will makes it difficult to gain complete control of his mind, body, and abilities. After taking possession of Megumi, Sukuna set out to break his will quickly and completely. Fortunately, he had the one thing Megumi was vulnerable to – his sister Tsumiki, who, during the Culling Game, was taken possession of by the ancient sorcerer Yorozu, who has been obsessed with Sukuna for centuries. Rather than keep her captive and taunt Megumi into submission. Sukuna went for the complete demolition of his spirit. Not only did he kill her, he used Megumi&rsquo;s own innate technique – the Mahoraga – to do it. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough evidence of Sukuna&rsquo;s wickedness, there&rsquo;s also the fact that in killing Tsumiki, he also killed Yorozu – who only person who loved him.</p>
<p>8  Yuta&rsquo;s Spiritual Enslavement of Rika
Chapter 0.4: &ldquo;A Bright Darkness&rdquo;, Jujutsu Kaisen 0</p>
<p>One of the reasons Yuta Okkutsu became such a Jujutsu Kaisen fan favorite was his sad but endearing origin story. The story of a sad, timid boy who can&rsquo;t make friends on account of the jealous spirit of his childhood best friend is enough to make anyone feel for him. Naturally, this made him nervous to make friends with others on the chance that, like Rika, would haunt him. But the reality was that it wasn’t Rika&rsquo;s feelings of loss at the moment of dying that caused her to become a curse. Rather, it was Yuta&rsquo;s sadness, shock, and fear after witnessing her death that blocked Rika from entering the afterlife and caused her to become a cursed spirit. Moreover, it was Yuta’s feelings, rather than her own, which led her to believe that her new place as a curse was to protect Yuta at all costs. That is, Yuta&rsquo;s inability and unwillingness to bring closure to her passing forced her – against her will – to become the evil spirit she never wanted to be.</p>
<p>7  Kenjaku&rsquo;s Betrayal of Mahito
Chapter 133: &ldquo;The Shibuya Incident, Part 50&rdquo;, Season 2, Episode 22: &ldquo;Metamorphosis, Part 2&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mahito might be one of the more despicable villains in the story, but few could deny that even he was wronged by Kenjaku. In classic Kenjaku fashion, Mahito was led to believe that he and his group of cursed spirits had his support and friendship. Another ally in Mahito&rsquo;s effort to eliminate humankind. However, just when he needs Kenjaku’s help the most – with Yuji stepping away from exorcising him, Kenjaku pulls the ultimate betrayal. Instead of helping him defeat Yuji, Kenjaku absorbed Mahito using Cursed Spirit Manipulation. Before he does, he admits that he&rsquo;s been using Mahito all along, and that he was no longer needed. The fact that Mahito had an idea of Kenjaku&rsquo;s treachery doesn&rsquo;t lessen the ffects of him backstabbing Mahito.</p>
<p>6  Riko Amanai&rsquo;s Assassination
Chapter 71: &ldquo;Hidden Inventory, Part 8&rdquo;, Season 2, Episode 3: &ldquo;Hidden Inventory 3&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite her buoyant personality, Riko Amanai had a tragic young life. Her parents were killed when she was a toddler, and with nearly no friends but her guardian, Misato, Riko grew up incredibly lonely. When she learned that she was a match for Master Tengen who needed a human vessel to possess or else he would lose his form, and Riko agreed. To her, there wasn&rsquo;t much more for her to do in her current life. However, after meeting Gojo and Geto, who were tasked with bringing her to Master Tengen, she had a change of heart. Their mini-adventure together awoke in her a joy of life that she&rsquo;d never experienced before. As a result, she began to regret her decision. After Geto explained to her that she could revoke her decision, Riko decided that she would. However, as soon as she decided not to merge with Master Tengen and enjoy a normal life, Toji Fushiguro shot her; tragically ending a life full of tragedy that was just about to turn the page for the better.</p>
<p>5  Nobara&rsquo;s Untimely Demise
Chapter 124: &ldquo;The Shibuya Incident, Part 42&rdquo;, Season 2, Episode 19: &ldquo;Right and Wrong, Part 2&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Gojo might be the face of the story in its earlier parts, Nobara Kugisaki is the star. As a country girl in the big city, she brought a refreshing balance to the gloomy Megumi and always-hyped Yuji. Moreover, she had wickedly cool innate technique. Despite knowing that one character was safe from a Gege decision to eliminate them, nobody saw Nobara&rsquo;s death coming. Not only was it shocking in its suddenness, but it was also incredibly grim. Firstly, there&rsquo;s the almost casual caress of her face by Mahito&rsquo;s hand, followed by the abrupt explosion after. Even for Jujutsu Kaisen, this was truly one of the more upsetting deaths. It&rsquo;s also one that makes clear that the war against evil curses like Mohito is just that -–a war where oftentimes even the best die too young.</p>
<p>4  Kenjaku&rsquo;s Sons
Chapter 60: &ldquo;The Origin of Obedience, Part 6&rdquo;, Season 1, Episode 24: &ldquo;Accomplices&rdquo;</p>
<p>As human-curse hybrids, Choso, and his brothers Kechizu, and Eso were something never encountered before or after in the Jujutsu sorcerer community. Long before Kenjaku possessed the corpse of Suguru Geto, he was known as Noritoshi Kamo. At some point during his life as Noritoshi, he came across a woman who could conceive human-curse children. Interested in her potential, Noritoshi imprisoned her, and forced her to parent the Cursed Womb Death Paintings which include Choso, Kechizu, and Eso with him. This situation is made even darker by the fact that the woman originally sought refuge with Noritoshi because her family had shunned her for not being able to conceive normal human children.</p>
<p>3  Sukuna Takes Possession of Megumi
Chapter 212: &ldquo;The Ripening, Part 2&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s darkest moments are also its saddest – and it doesn&rsquo;t get more upsetting than Sukuna&rsquo;s possession of Megumi. Catching Megumi off guard just as he&rsquo;s trying to process the fact that his sister – whom he has just rescued – had been possessed by another sorcerer, Sukuna shoved one of Yuji&rsquo;s fingers that he ripped off his own hand down Megumi&rsquo;s throat. While Sukuna coveted Megumi&rsquo;s innate technique, he also knew he had a vulnerable personality; he wasn&rsquo;t as mentally tough as Yuji. Accordingly, Sukuna knew he&rsquo;d be able to mentally batter him into submission and mental enslavement.</p>
<p>2  Maki Slaughters the Entire Zenin Clan
Chapters 150-152: &ldquo;Perfect Preparation, Epilogue&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since her birth, there wasn&rsquo;t a familial bond between Maki Zenin and her clan. Born with almost no innate sorcerer abilities in one of the three Great Sorcerer Clans, she was deemed worthless by the senior clan leaders – which included her father. Nevertheless, Maki set out to prove she&rsquo;s worthy of her clan’s prestige by focusing on her superhero-like physical abilities. Her abilities were a result of the splitting of her sorcerer abilities with her twin sister, who received the majority of the family&rsquo;s innate abilities. However, after her sister Mai&rsquo;s sacrifice that was necessary for her to be Jujutsu Kaizen&rsquo;s new Toji, she decided to get revenge on the family and the clan that treated her poorly. She did it in the most brutal way possible - by brutalizing every member of the clan, including her mother.</p>
<p>1  Gojo&rsquo;s Death to Sukuna
Chapter 236: &ldquo;Heading South&rdquo;</p>
<p>The death of Gojo at the hands of Sukuna might just be the darkest of dark moments for Jujutsu Kaisen, but it&rsquo;s not simply based on the brutality of Sukuna’s killing method. Instead, the lion&rsquo;s share of this moment&rsquo;s darkness arises from the shadow it casts over the rest of an already grim existence in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. As long as he was alive, Gojo kept operating the idea and the hope that evil sorcerers and malignant curses could be defeated. Indeed, Kenjaku was so afraid of the threat that Gojo posed to his plans that he went to incredible lengths to sideline him. While Gojo might have matured enough to believe that his presence was no longer necessary, a frightfully few others believe that the world is a better place with his passing. Rather, there is palpable fear in the Jujutsu sorcerer community that Sukuna&rsquo;s victory marks the start of the darkest era ever.
