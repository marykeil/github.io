## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen may finally be on the path to redeeming its protagonist by giving Yuji a much-needed boost in power in the latest chapter.





Following Gojo&#39;s shocking defeat and death at Shinjuku, the battle against Sukuna seems all but one-sided with even the bout against Kashimo nearing a standstill. Sensing this, more of the onlooking sorcerers on standby have entered the fray, including Hakari, Higuruma, and Yuji. Uphill as the battle may seem, Yuji&#39;s new mysterious power could end up shifting the tide in the sorcerers&#39; favor.




                  Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Fans Can Say Farewell To Another Popular Hero   Sukunaâ€™s return to his original form does not bode well for his opponents, and it suggests that fans&#39; worst fears about another popular hero are true.   


 Yuji Has Awakened a Cursed Technique or Is Using A Cursed Tool 
          

In Chapter #238, Yuji can be spotted with a pair of mysterious blade-like objects sticking out from his forearms that he appears to be tightening as he descends on Sukuna with Higuruma. While it isn&#39;t clear what exactly these could be, the most likely explanation is a Cursed Tool similar to the one Yuta sported in Chapter #178. Yuji also seems to have grown sharp claws much like Sukuna&#39;s which has led to speculation that he may have finally awakened either Sukuna&#39;s Cursed Technique, one of his own, or even eaten Sukuna&#39;s last missing finger.




That said, despite the similarities, it seems unlikely that Yuji would manifest Sukuna&#39;s Cursed Technique after the latter has switched vessels. While it is possible that Sukuna&#39;s final finger (which was assumed to be in Gojo&#39;s possession) could have played a part in this process, it would be pointless for Yuji to go up against a fully reincarnated Sukuna with the power of just one finger without a boost in his own capabilities as well.

In that regard, another popularly held belief among fans is that Yuji may have awakened his own Cursed Technique. However, such a development would have been monumental and to have no mention of it by any other character so far or any sort of build-up leading up to it seems odd to say the least, though the upcoming chapters may provide some exposition on that matter.

Nevertheless, regardless of the nature of this power-up, Jujutsu Kaisen has finally set the stage for Yuji&#39;s destined battle against Sukuna and also given him the chance to take center stage once more as the main character. Though Sukuna seems all but undefeatable at the moment, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s battle of Shinjuku is nearing its climax and only time will tell if Yuji&#39;s power-up will make him the last one standing.




Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Viz Media.
