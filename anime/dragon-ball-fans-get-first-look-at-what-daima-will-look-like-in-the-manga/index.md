## SUMMARY 



  Dragon Ball DAIMA will feature Goku and Vegeta as kids, and a recent illustration by Toyotarou gives fans a glimpse of their new look in the manga.   The upcoming anime is set to debut in Fall 2024 and may eventually have a manga adaptation, following the franchise&#39;s trend of crossing over media platforms.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball fans get a glimpse of what the main characters of the upcoming anime DAIMA would look like in the manga thanks to Toyotarou.




Fans who are still reeling from the announcement of the new anime Dragon Ball DAIMA just got a glimpse at what the main characters from the series, Goku and Vegeta rejuvenated into kids, would look like in the manga thanks to Dragon Ball Super artist Toyotarou.




A new illustration from Toyotarou was recently shared online by the @DbsHype X account. The drawing features Goku and Vegeta, who will be turned back into kids along with the other members of the series cast as the premise of the new show.


 

Dragon Ball DAIMA is an anime that will be produced by Toei Animation, debuting in Fall 2024, but if Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero has taught anything to fans is that the franchise is not afraid to cross its media, and the story of DAIMA could end up in a manga at some point.


 Toyotarou&#39;s Dragon Ball DAIMA Illustration Scared Some Fans 
          

This is not the first time that Toyotarou shared an homage to the upcoming new series. The artist produced an illustration of young Goku as part of his monthly drawing series, and he now picks up the pace by adding an adorable Kid Vegeta, who is portrayed at the moment before he fires off his trademark Galick Gun. The words in the drawing congratulate the franchise&#39;s expansion in 2024.




What&#39;s quite interesting about this illustration is that many fans online took it as an announcement that an upcoming arc of the Dragon Ball Super would be an adaptation of DAIMA&#39;s story, and the reactions were not positive. This builds off the controversy caused by the most recent part of the Dragon Ball Super manga, the Super Hero Arc, which was a faithful adaptation of the Super Hero movie that many fans did not appreciate.

          

Luckily, this illustration is simply a little homage made by Toyotarou to the upcoming new anime. Fans of Dragon Ball Super can look forward to its next chapter where, according to a tease from V-Jump&#39;s editor, a brand-new story arc will start. Meanwhile, the hype and anticipation around Dragon Ball DAIMA will keep building until the series makes its expected debut in the Fall of 2024.
