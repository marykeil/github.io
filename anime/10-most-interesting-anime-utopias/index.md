## Literature Review

These anime show that even in the most idealistic depictions of society, perfection can never be achieved and everything comes at a cost.





Utopian fiction is always mesmerizing because it seeks to portray genuinely perfect worlds. However, as the existence of such worlds is simply not possible, there will always be flaws and weaknesses hiding right below the surface, waiting to disrupt the image that is typically only alluring on the surface level. As these great anime utopias prove, even in the most ideal of situations, objective and absolute perfection will never be achievable.









 








 10  Harmony 
        

Harmony is a movie that seeks to portray a situation where the safety and happiness of society are taken to an unhealthy extreme, leading to unintended side effects in the process. After humanity was nearly wiped out by a cataclysmic event, the World Health Organization focused all of their efforts on developing medical nanotechnology and leading social welfare, resulting in a society where people are not only granted eternal life, but also guaranteed to be happier. However, this is done through a totalitarian surveillance system, which many see as a restriction of their personal freedom, suggesting that such excessive kindness can prove to be almost dehumanizing instead.





 9  Carole &amp; Tuesday 
        

As a brilliant musical anime first and foremost, the emphasis of Carole &amp; Tuesday may not necessarily lie on the wonders of the world that it is set in, but the world-building is certainly developed enough to create a place that most viewers find rather alluring. Decades after humankind began to migrate to the now terraformed Mars, people are generally able to live peaceful and comfortable lives, thanks to the advancements of technology, particularly in the realm of AI. Naturally, discrepancies exist, even between the titular protagonists Carole and Tuesday, the latter of whom is born into a wealthy family, but even the underprivileged live generally pleasant lives.





 8  Psycho-Pass 
        

In a near-future version of Japan, society is defined by the SIbyl System, a supposedly objective system meant to assess the latent criminal potential of people, in an attempt to prevent and minimize crime. Additionally, it can also determine the ideal profession of every citizen, setting them on the appropriate path to guaranteed success. The world of Psycho-Pass is far from a perfect one, as indicated by the leading characters&#39; encounters with various criminals, as well as their attempt to reveal the truth behind the secretly corrupt system, but its efficiency can hardly be disregarded, as citizens do genuinely experience increased levels of perceived safety and happiness.





 7  Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet 
        

In a world where humanity managed to leave their original planet and explore the depths of outer space, the best place to live still turns out to be their very own home, Earth. In Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet, an organization known as &#34;The Galactic Alliance of Humankind&#34; seeks to ensure the prosperity of humanity through continued exploration, but their mission is impeded by their perpetual war with Hideauze, a powerful alien race. Away from the war and troubles of pioneering humans, the ocean-covered Earth has become the residence of fleets of giant ships, where people live peacefully and survive by salvaging relics of the past.

 6  No. 6 
        

As No. 6 depicts both utopias and dystopias, its classification is rather subjective. As a consequence of tragic world wars, humanity decided to take shelter in 6 different city-states, finally living in peace and comfort. However, unbeknownst to most of the privileged elite residing here, there is more to the world beyond their walls, with many other humans being forced to live in the slums and wastelands, struggling to survive every day. Yet, to the blissfully ignorant, life may seem just perfect; they lack for nothing, as everything they could possibly desire is always within reach, truly living in the utopias they were promised.





 5  No Game No Life 
        

No Game No Life is a utopia more specific than others, as the main appeal of its world lies in the emphasis on games. The story revolves around the sibling duo of Shiro and Sora, also known as &#34;Blank&#34;, a username they use to dominate various online games together. After a god named Tet takes an interest in them and invites them to Disboard, they find themselves stuck in a magical world much unlike their own, where everything is decided through games. Naturally, to super-geniuses who were just getting bored with the games they were used to, this makes for an exciting opportunity to test their skills in new challenges.





 4  Cross Ange: Rondo of Angel and Dragon 
        

The world of Cross Ange: Rondo of Angel and Dragon is not one without flaws, especially for the ones who are unable to wield Mana and perform magic. This includes the protagonist, Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi, who, despite being a princess, is revealed to also be a Norma, which is why she is treated as an outcast and exiled to a cruel and ruthless place. However, to everyone other than the Norma, the kingdom is a kind and safe place, thanks to the Mana&#39;s revolutionary power reducing the threats of wars and pollution. This world may be built on lies, but those unaware of the truth are able to enjoy truly blessed lives.





 3  Kyousougiga 
        

Kyousougiga is a vibrant, avant-garde title, whose story is set in a genuine utopia for any fans of creative and imaginative unique anime art styles. After a monk&#39;s power to bring any painting to life was deemed too powerful and troublesome to be ignored, Myoue and his wife, Koto, decided to escape into one of his own painting worlds, the Looking Glass City. This world is more colorful and beautiful than reality ever could be, with its residents living genuinely enviable, idyllic lives. Things aren&#39;t always perfect, however, especially when Myoue and Koto disappear, but everything is solved eventually, with the world returning to its natural state.





 2  Expelled from Paradise 
        

As a consequence of a massive disaster turning Earth into a wasteland, most of humanity chose to abandon their physical bodies and have their minds digitized and processed into a virtual reality environment on DEVA, an advanced space station orbiting their former home. Renouncing their former bodies leads to a much different existence, one where no one can experience death or hunger, instead living in relative peace and quiet, without being ailed by too many issues and concerns. However, the weaknesses of such a system begin to show when a skilled hacker infiltrates and interferes with it, prompting Angela Balzac, a law enforcer, to search for him.





 1  Aria The Animation 
        

Despite being set in the far future, the world of Aria the Animation is not one defined by advanced technology and volatile innovations. Even though humans were able to colonize Mars, now known as Aqua, they chose to maintain and build upon its natural beauty. The story is set in the city of Neo Venezia, a city inspired by Earth&#39;s Venice, where transportation is mainly conducted through gondolas. These gondolas are also used by companies, such as the titular Aria Company, to provide guided tours that emphasize the city&#39;s rich history and rustic tranquility. By going against the grain, this title manages to stand out and become uniquely memorable.
Often, when it comes to utopia, it is present alongside dystopia, suggesting that the prosperity of a group can only be sustained through the exploitation of another, visualizing the idea that life may be a zero-sum game. At other times, the focus is on slowly but surely revealing all the inconsistencies and weaknesses of an overly idealistic idea, proving that perfection will always be out of reach for humanity. Whether it&#39;s subtle or obvious, the complexity and depth of such titles is what makes the most interesting anime utopias well worth watching.
