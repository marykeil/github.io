## Literature Review

Netflix&#39;s wide catalog includes shonen from all corners of the genre, from hidden gems to the old classics. 




The best shonen anime on Netflix include classic and newer entries to the industry that were borderline impossible to find before Netflix brought them to the forefront of streaming. As the modern spearhead of streaming services, Netflix has put more emphasis on anime in the past few years, resulting in a wide, but frequently changing catalog of shows.
However, many of the shonen series on Netflix have stayed from the beginning of the platform&#39;s entry into the industry, bringing long-time audiences back for nostalgia. There are also shonen series that have higher turnover, which enjoy quick but bright spotlights for the time they are available. Pulling from both of these types of series, the comprehensive list of the best shonen series currently carried by Netflix includes a splash of all corners of the demographic.
            
 
 10 Most Iconic Shonen Anime Scenes Ever 
Shonen anime is known for outrageous sequences that combine huge emotions with outrageous spectacle - here are the 10 greatest of all time.












 








 10  Naruto Is the Flagship Ninja Series 
Based on the manga by Kishimoto Masashi


 







Although Naruto is considered one of the &#34;Big Three&#34; shonen anime, along with Bleach and One Piece, that status refers to Naruto as a franchise, while Netflix only carries the original 2002 series and a few Naruto: Shippuden movies. As a result, Naruto on Netflix is not at its best due to the lack of the comprehensive nature of the entire franchise.
However, there is much to appreciate in the story that follows the ostracized and aspiring ninja, Naruto. Each episode produces high-octane battles and plot movement, but unfortunately, it is undermined by excessive filler and incomprehensible character development.

 9  Saiki K Tops Gag Shonen 
Based on the manga by Asou Shuuichi
        

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K isn&#39;t a title that typically comes to mind when discussing shonen anime, mainly because it lacks the plot points and complex battles that are usually present. However, although the shonen genre is dominated by battle shonen, there is much more to explore, Saiki K&#39;s gag humor included.
The story follows Saiki Kusuo, an overpowered psychic, who only wishes to live a normal life. However, interactions with friends and the world around him prove that to be a near impossibility. Through hilarious hijinks and a well-thought-out cast of characters, Saiki K blends the best of both worlds of comedy and shonen.

 8  Kuroko&#39;s Basketball Is Netflix&#39;s Best Sports Shonen 
Based on the manga by Fujimaki Tadatoshi
        

Much like the gag comedy subgenre of shonen, the sports genre is overlooked more often than not, and the existence of Kuroko&#39;s Basketball on Netflix proves that. The anime is an endearing story of a practically invisible high school boy named Kuroko, who was known as the legendary sixth man of his championship dominating middle school team, due to his passing and misdirection skills.
Now in high school, Kuroko embarks on a new journey of developing his own personal basketball game and not relying on prodigy teammates as he had in middle school, growing into a team of his own founded on new camaraderie.

 7  Tiger &amp; Bunny Is the Embodiment of Rejuvenation 
Original series directed by Satou Keiichi


 







Tiger &amp; Bunny first aired in 2011, and revolutionized the concept of shonen anime. While most shonen follow young, male protagonists (shonen means young boy in Japanese), Tiger &amp; Bunny boasts a cast of young adults instead, and follows washed-up superhero Kotetsu. Under the name of Wild Tiger, Kotetsu pairs up with up-and-coming superstar Barnaby Brooks Jr., sparking contentious arguments and perhaps the best duo of all time.
Although Wild Tiger is introduced as a relic on the verge of retirement, the story of Tiger &amp; Bunny shows, through one touching moment at a time, that even in middle age, limitless potential can still be unearthed.

 6  One Piece Is Ever Present 
Based on the manga by Oda Eiichiro


 







Discussing One Piece is inescapable when considering the best shonen on any platform, as the 1999 anime is one of the currently longest-running anime, and has always been synonymous with the phrase successful shonen. The story of One Piece follows a goofy, high-energy young man called Luffy, who is on a journey to find the Pirate King&#39;s legacy, the One Piece. Along the way, Luffy collects a crew of like-minded friends, as they all develop and contribute to Luffy’s cause in their own ways.
The deep world-building and character crafting makes One Piece one of the best stories of all time, but the anime has suffered in the past from inconsistent animation quality. Interestingly, Netflix seems to be attempting a monopoly on One Piece, based on the success of the live-action series and the announcement of an anime remake that will be streaming on the platform.

 5  Demon Slayer Is a Modern Masterpiece 
Based on the manga by Gotouge Koyoharu
        

Having first aired in 2019, Demon Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba, exploded in popularity and anticipation even before the first episode was released. The series did not fail to meet expectations, capturing the hearts of many fans through its relatable cast and its wonderfully compelling animation quality.
The story of Demon Slayer follows protagonists Kamado Tanjirou and Kamado Nezuko as they journey to avenge their families and slay the demons that bring misfortune to the world. Although the premise is quite straightforward, there is a twist in that Nezuko herself has been turned into a demon. As a result, the stakes are even higher for this sibling duo.

 4  Vinland Saga Is a Lot More than a Great Shonen 
Based on the manga by Yukimura Makoto
        

Vinland Saga is a unique shonen anime in the way it incorporates historical details with personalized narrative movement, all the while perfectly encapsulating the image of traditional Vikings. The series follows main character Thorfinn as he roams the chaotic lands of war as a mercenary. Among the political turmoil in the world of Vinland Saga, the Vikings live only for battle and bloodshed.
The story of Thorfinn is a complex, but brutally poignant depiction of war and the diversity of personal agendas, as Thorfinn’s ultimate goal is to avenge his father by killing Askeladd under the veil of the fighting chaos. From the second season, however, Thorfinn&#39;s journey becomes one of redemption as he seeks to navigate his violent world as a pacifist.

 3  Death Note Is a Portal Into the Shonen Macabre 
Based on the manga by Obata Takeshi and Ohba Tsugumi


 







Death Note is psychological horror, mystery, and fantasy all wrapped into the guise of shonen anime. The premise of Death Note, a magical black book that can deliver death to any name written on its pages, caused a revolutionary wave of fanaticism in the anime community, as small, black notebooks rapidly circulated among merchandise.
However, all the series popularity was not due to its premise alone. The story weaves a complex web of dramatic irony as a cast of genius characters engage in psychological warfare, all while moral deliberations fall to the wayside. All of Death Note’s shining qualities build it up to be a thriller of a shonen series.

 2  Hunter x Hunter Masters the Usage of the Arc 
Based on the manga by Togashi Yoshihiro
        

The 2011 Hunter x Hunter anime is a remake of the 1999 adaptation of the same name, and it more than satiated the clambering fans of the original series. The story follows a young boy named Gon who embarks on becoming a Hunter in order to find his father, who exited his life when he was only a baby.
Instead of despising his father, Gon is captivated by what is so interesting about being a Hunter that made his father leave him behind.Hunter x Hunter takes this sentiment and expertly crafts an adventure story like no other, organizing Gon’s journeys into a perfect flow of story arcs. Known for its ultra-complex power system, cerebral fights, and unique characters, Hunter X Hunter is still a shonen juggernaut today.

 1  Evangelion Is An Uncrowned Shonen King 
Original series directed by Anno Hideaki
        

The 1995 Neon Genesis Evangelion series is a classic anime with a multiplicity of aspects, but greatly goes underappreciated as a shonen. While many consider Evangelion a seinen (young adult) anime due to its mature themes, the original series can be easily seen as a shonen too. Not only crafts unforgettable characters and an unforgiving world of EVAs and Angels, it is also the precursor to the many movies that follow, creating almost a multiverse of continuations and alternate interpretations of the original series.
Evangelion follows the main character, Ikari Shinji, as he is thrown into a position of responsibility for the entire human race. The narrative begins as a typical shonen, but quickly diverges into internal moral battles, psychological renderings, convoluted relationships, and much more, cementing it as the number one shonen on Netflix.
