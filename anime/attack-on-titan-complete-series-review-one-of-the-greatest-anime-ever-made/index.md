## Literature Review

Attack on Titan is an incredible series that ended on a high point, firmly establishing the series as one of the greatest anime ever made.




Attack On Titan is finally over, and the ending cements it as one of the greatest anime series ever made. Offering something for almost every type of anime fan, Attack On Titan is an undisputed masterpiece, and Hajime Isayama&#39;s legacy will forever be remembered because of it.




The anime adaptation of Isayama&#39;s dark action shonen manga originally began airing in 2013, and has been at the forefront of the medium&#39;s rise in popularity in the West. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, Attack On Titan doesn&#39;t have a unique setting. Many anime and shows deal with a fight for survival, but as the series continued, fans grew to understand what set Attack on Titan&#39;s world apart from the rest.

 Attack On Titan&#39;s Plot Twists Make the Series What It Is 
Created by WIT Studio and Mappa, based on the original manga by Hajime Isayama
         

No other anime does plot twists quite like Attack On Titan. Nothing in Attack on Titan is sudden or pointless, and the series always leaves viewers with little hints at twists to come. One of the biggest twists in Attack on Titan was the reveal that Reiner and Bertholdt were villains. The two were integral members of the Scouts and were like family to Eren and the rest of the cast. What made their betrayal even more astonishing was the timing. The Scouts were celebrating, and out of the blue, Reiner revealed himself as a traitor. Even Eren was beyond shocked, and thought Reiner was going crazy. This moment wasn&#39;t just a plot twist – it was series-defining.




Season 4 had a similarly wild plot twist. Zeke and Eren were going through memories, in hopes that Eren would agree with Zeke&#39;s plans. Memory after memory, it seemed like Zeke was in control, but that all changed when Grisha Yeager&#39;s darkest moment was finally revealed. Eren influenced the past by using the Paths and convinced his father to kill the Royal Fritz family. Zeke had been convinced that Eren was brainwashed by Grisha just like he was, but finding out that it was the other way around broke him. Eren was the villain all along, not his father. What made it more excruciating for Zeke was that Grisha could feel his presence and apologized for everything he did.

It should&#39;ve been obvious that Isayama was a master at taking fans by surprise when Eren was devoured by a Titan at the beginning of the series. That scene shocked viewers to their core, but the series proved time and time again that it could do better. From Annie&#39;s reveal as the Female Titan, Titans being inside the wall, to the discovery of life outside the walls – there were many bombshells that no one could&#39;ve theorized or seen coming. The masterful writing by the author made suspense the most prevalent emotion invoked when viewing the anime.






 There Were Always Subtle Hints 
Attack on Titan&#39;s expert foreshadowing
          

Foreshadowing is one of Hajime Isayama&#39;s many talents. Only after a big reveal happened could fans realize that a small detail in that one chapter served a larger purpose. In season 3, Eren is kidnapped by Rod Reiss who wishes to reclaim the power of the Founding Titan. Eren is chained to a crystal cliff, and he says that the cave was familiar after he woke up. Much later, it was revealed that he was indeed there when his future self convinced Grisha to kill the royal family in that very cave. These hints are brilliantly sneaked into scenes where a viewer&#39;s attention is focused on something much larger happening.

Throughout the show, there were quite a few moments that didn&#39;t make immediate sense to viewers, such as Reiner surviving the Female Titan&#39;s attack after taking down his hood and lunging at her. That extremely minuscule detail explained a lot that puzzled viewers. Since the Female Titan was killing the Scouts, Reiner wanted her to know it was him and to not kill him. This worked, and he secretly sliced Eren&#39;s location into her hand. It seems that everything is there for a reason, and no single scene is wasted.






 Breathtaking Animation &amp; Visuals That Entrance Viewers 
Attack on Titan&#39;s production value was always flawless

 

Attack on Titan&#39;s animation quality is unmatched. Every scene possesses extreme detail, and it&#39;s easy to tell that a lot of effort was put into it. The first 3 seasons were animated by WIT Studio, which propelled the studio and helped them acquire animation rights for series such as Vinland Saga and Suicide Squad Isekai. The character movements are smooth, the fights are dynamic, the art style is gorgeous, and the visuals are aesthetically pleasing. Fans were distraught when it was announced that Mappa would take over production, but season 4 proved to be just as good.

The show is elevated to an even higher status because of the music and sound design that perfectly complements the animation. Each theme song is carefully placed so that it matches whatever emotion the scene will invoke. What made the betrayal of Reiner even better is the majestic soundtrack that is hailed as the best OST in anime. Mappa then recruited the incredibly talented composer, Kohta Yamamoto, who produced the incredible hype &#34;Ashes On The Fire&#34; that makes fans want to scream Shinzo Wa Sasageyo!!. The opening and ending songs are unforgettable, matching the ominous storyline of the series.








The anime &#34;Attack on Titan&#34; is finally heading toward its finale. These last four years, I faced this project every single day going, &#34;Fight... Fight...&#34;


We put everything I could possibly think of into this, and I believe the final footage is just a compilation of all of our passion.


A new script from Isayama-sensei, the actors&#39; soul-filled performances,


the absolute perfect pieces of music.


Please experience all of this!

 An Incredible Ensemble of Characters 
          




While Eren is the protagonist, there are many instances where the spotlight is stolen from him by different characters. Attack On Titan is the only anime where side characters are fighting for screen time, and it&#39;s actually received positively. The show makes sure everyone has their time to shine: Historia asserting herself as dependable, Mikasa brutally taking down dozens of Titans, and Levi coming to the rescue on more than one occasion. Each character is as deep as the other, and everyone has their unique role. In fact, Levi is set to receive his own spin-off Attack on Titan chapter.

Attack on Titan also does the writing of female characters very well. The common damsel-in-distress trope is non-existent in the series. The women in the series are very powerful and play key roles throughout the story. Annie, Mikasa, Historia, Ymir, Hange, and more are all great examples of female characters. There is also no sexualization in the series either, which usually stunts their character development and causes them to not be taken seriously.




Like anything else, Attack on Titan does have its flaws. The controversial ending is the biggest gripe fans have. As good as the show is, it&#39;s not immune to criticism. However, the amount of stuff it gets right far outnumbers its pitfalls. From the dedicated staff to its creator, there are many people to thank, and Attack on Titan will surely inspire the next generation of anime and manga for decades to come.





It’s been 10 years since the TV anime started. Thank you very much for sticking with us through all that time. The climax scene that happens in the last half of the final season was very hard to draw in the original manga, as well, so I couldn’t help but think, “This is going to be rough for MAPPA. MAPPA is probably thinking, ‘Please stop&#39;. I’m sorry, MAPPA. I’m really sorry.” Even then, I’m very excited to see how it’ll turn out in the anime.
