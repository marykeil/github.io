## Literature Review

I&#39;m in Love with the Villainess&#39; main Yuri premise and shtick might pander to unfortunate tropes, but the series quickly offers a healthy balance.




Warning: Spoilers for I&#39;m In Love With The Villainess episode #8An ongoing new Yuri anime called I&#39;m in Love with the Villainess that unfortunately portrays the lesbian protagonist in the most unflattering light luckily gives her more depth later on during its debut season. The Crunchyroll series is also one of many isekai anime about a character who gets transported into a romance game or novel, either as the female hero or villain.






I&#39;m In Love With The Villainess is an adaptation of the light novel series written by Inori and illustrated by Hanagata.




Although there are many serious Yuri series, a few pander to an unfortunate stereotype where the &#34;token&#34; lesbian obsesses over her crush to an uncomfortable degree, usually terrifying and/or annoying the object of their desires while coming across as an uncontrollable and inappropriate lecher.

          

The isekai&#39;d hero, Rae Taylor, definitely fits this characterization in how she treats the eponymous villainess, Claire FranÃ§ois.


 I&#39;m In Love With The Villainess Explores Orientation Prejudices and True Feelings 
          




Of course, Rae Taylor&#39;s advances are humorous and sometimes even charming. Moreover, Claire is actually a pretty unattractive type of character herself, which partly justifies Rae&#39;s antics. Claire is a spoiled noble who enjoys ridiculing commoners, and since Rae is a commoner, the fact she enjoys the constant mistreatment undermines Claire&#39;s maliciousness. And yet, there are moments sprinkled throughout its current eight episodes that humanize Rae while adding some much-needed context to her actions.

One of the most important first moments takes place at the end of episode #3 when Rae is asked important questions about her feelings and gender identity. In addition to opening the conversation to straight and lesbian prejudices, this allows Rae to provide insights into her preferences that extend beyond just lust. Moreover, the conversation wades into a very real subject when Rae explains the difficulties associated with &#34;forbidden&#34; love. Viewers learn about how her situation has forced her to adopt an unfortunate mindset that requires her to prioritize others&#39; feelings. So even though Rae harasses Claire after episode #3, there&#39;s an underlying sense of loss that gives them more meaning.






 I&#39;m In Love With The Villains Manipulates Otome Isekai Tropes To Underscore Kindness 
          

Claire is also humanized when Rae showcases affection since Claire can&#39;t help but be kind in return. Of course, the hope is that Claire&#39;s actions are driven more by romantic desires than friendship. Ironically, the greatest example of this plays off one of the series&#39; many borrowed tropes in episode #7. Since I&#39;m In Love With The Villainess is a formulaic series that draws from the otome/romantic novel isekai genre, Rae abides by many of the genre&#39;s storylines.

Rae was originally an avid player of the otome game she got isekai&#39;d into and uses her knowledge to manipulate others to get what she wants. However, her infatuation with Claire creates problems as the game&#39;s goal is to get one of the male princes to fall in love with her. Since she is doing everything in her power to get them to ignore her, she finds herself in difficult situations that would only work out in her favor if one of the princes liked her. In one instance where one of the princes is supposed to save her, Claire comes to her rescue instead because of Rae&#39;s love for her.




So while I&#39;m in Love with the Villainess does diminish the legitimate feelings of its lesbian protagonist while indulging in isekai cliches, it&#39;s how masterfully the series navigates within the genre&#39;s strict rule book that makes this anime a much better Yuri series.
