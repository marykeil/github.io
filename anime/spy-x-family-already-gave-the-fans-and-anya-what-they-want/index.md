## Literature Review

While Loid and Yor’s relationship began as a contractual arrangement, their marriage has already shown signs that they’ve actually fallen in love.




Contrary to popular belief, in Spy x Family&#39;s Forger household has already shown signs that Loid and Yor are falling for each other. As Loid, Yor, and Anya have faced existential situations that threaten to unwind their faked family, one reality is becoming increasingly apparent – Loid and Yor are falling for each other.




Fans have been waiting for the real spark of attraction to take over the two leads for some time now. The signs of Loid and Yor&#39;s growing romantic feelings for one another have been around from the very beginning. More recently, however, the signs are becoming increasingly hard to ignore.

          

In chapter #80 of Spy x Family, Yor and Loid have an argument over gripes in their relationship. Yor wants to have gripes with Loid because she believes that&#39;s a sign of a meaningful marriage. On the other hand, Loid is nervous that Yor&#39;s gripes are real. He wants to do everything he can to find out what they are so that he can take the steps to resolve them.


 Spy x Family Hints Loid &amp; Yor Are Falling for Each Other 
          




Chapter #80 of Spy x Family is one of first times both Loid and Yor truly seem eager to &#34;make up&#34; before any bad feelings settle in – just like a normal couple. While the scene has a decidedly humorous tone, the romantic sentiment between the two is obvious as each struggles to find a way to show their interest in one another. Regardless of how they feel though, the blossoming romance between Loid and Yor has one guaranteed fan – Anya.

                  Spy x Family&#39;s Loid Vs Yor Fight Would Have One Deciding Factor   While all eyes would be on Yor and Loid’s skills if they were to ever fight, the true deciding factor has nothing to do with fighting techniques.   

For Anya, having Loid and Yor fall in love increases the possibility that they&#39;ll all stay together, which is one of her deepest desires. Moreover, once she senses their feelings for one another, Anya can try to speed things along. Anya&#39;s assistance might not be necessary, as both Loid and Yor seem to be coming to terms with their feelings. Nowhere is this more obvious than in chapter 86. Yor admits to wanting to &#34;take care&#34; of Loid. Then, Loid&#39;s admits that the reason he&#39;s been so &#34;off&#34; on the job might be his feelings for Yor.






 Loid &amp; Yor&#39;s Feelings for Eachother Will Only Grow in Spy x Family 
          

Both of the Forger parents fight the urge to completely give in to their emotions, but with Loid&#39;s mission far from over, and Yor&#39;s need to maintain a suitable cover for her own job, they&#39;ll continue to be put in situations where proximity and affection are required. As anyone who&#39;s ever been in love knows, the challenges of controlling one&#39;s feelings are real, especially when the object of desire is as close as Loid and Yor are in Spy x Family.
