## Literature Review

Blue Box has been the poster romance manga of Weekly Shonen Jump for over two years, and it&#39;s set to finally receive an anime adaptation.




It&#39;s safe to say that Blue Box is the biggest romance manga to be serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump in years. The series has repeatedly been met with praise from fans and critics alike, and the simple fact that it&#39;s survived in Weekly Shonen Jump for over two years is proof of how much staying power it&#39;s managed to develop during its run.




Blue Box has certainly made a name for itself in Weekly Shonen Jump, and it&#39;s now set to receive an anime adaptation. As revealed at Jump Festa 2024, Blue Box&#39;s anime will be produced by Telecom Animation Film and UNLIMITED PRODUCE by TMS and will star Shoya Chiba as Taiki Inomata, Reina Ueda as Chinatu Kano, and Akari Kito as Hina Chono.

          

Details are still sparse, especially information regarding the anime&#39;s release date, but more information can be expected to be revealed in the coming months, and regardless, the fact that Blue Box is getting an anime at all is still great to see.

 When Will Blue Box&#39;s Anime Be Released? 
While there is no official release date, plenty of new information was revealed

 

The biggest question about Blue Box&#39;s anime that needs to be addressed is when the anime can be expected to air. While it&#39;s highly likely that the anime will start in 2024, anime adaptations don&#39;t necessarily start in a relatively recent timeframe from their announcement; a relevant example of this is how another Weekly Shonen Jump manga, Mission: Yozakura Family, was announced to be receiving an anime in 2022, but it won’t be airing until spring 2024. With no confirmed release date, there&#39;s no way of knowing how long it will take for Blue Box&#39;s anime to come out, but ideally, that information will come out sooner rather than later.



 Why Blue Box Is Such A Big Hit In Weekly Shonen Jump 
          




Another topic that merits discussion is how Blue Box has managed to find so much success in Weekly Shonen Jump. While Blue Box is primarily a romance story, it&#39;s also a sports story, with Taiki playing badminton and Chinatsu being a basketball player. Whenever the manga focuses on the pair&#39;s respective sports, it perfectly executes all the typical hallmarks of the genre, such as willpower and intense rivalries. Despite their differences, the sports and romance themes that Blue Box manages to balance make up for any of their respective shortcomings, and that&#39;s allowed Blue Box to stand out from its contemporaries in both genres and become a mainstay in Weekly Shonen Jump.

Of course, the biggest draw to Blue Box is how its romance is handled. Unlike a lot of shonen romance manga, Blue Box has no harem elements, nor does it dwell on any love triangles, and Taiki and Chinatsu confess their feelings after only two years, so the story has room to explore them as a couple. Blue Box flies in the face of the typical clichés of romance manga, making it a perfect hallmark of how the genre has evolved and a perfect addition to modern Weekly Shonen Jump, and once the anime comes out, its strengths are sure to reach an even wider audience.
