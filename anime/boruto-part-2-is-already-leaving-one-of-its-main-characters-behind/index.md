## Literature Review

Kawaki became the main villain at the end of Boruto but he seems to have already lost all his relevance in Two Blue Vortex, where he shows no growth.





After reality was rewritten at the end of Boruto Part 1 and Kawaki took Boruto&#39;s place in the new world, the opening chapters of Two Blue Vortex examine the consequences of Kawaki&#39;s actions, while letting fans catch up with the main cast after three years. In Chapter #2, Konoha is attacked by Code&#39;s Claw Grimes. Kawaki participates in the fight, but he surely does not shine. He rushes into the fight without any real plan, gets overpowered by one of the Claw Grimes, and has to be rescued by the other ninjas. Meanwhile, the new version of Boruto single-handedly dispatches at least six of the Claw Grimes with minimal effort and boldly proclaims he is now a lot stronger than Code.





 Kawaki Doesn&#39;t Seem To Fit In The New Boruto World 
          

Ironically, even though Kawaki is the one responsible for reality being rewritten thanks to his wish that utilized Eida&#39;s Omnipotence, he is the character the least affected by the new reality. Sarada still remembers the old world and is on a mission to restore the old world. Boruto is a renegade exile with a new, colder personality and the protagonist attitude Boruto fans always wanted him to have. Even Code seems more focused on Boruto as an opponent than Kawaki. Although Kawaki may have taken Boruto&#39;s place as a Konoha&#39;s hero, he is the one who seems left in the dust in these initial chapters of the sequel.

          




While everyone else seems involved in bigger things, Kawaki looks like a secondary character. He defends Konoha because it&#39;s attacked, but he does not have the authority, charisma, or commitment that one would expect. It looks like his whole driving purpose was to get rid of Boruto, and after he accomplished it, he has nothing left going on for him as a character. This is mostly affirmed by the fact that Kawaki doesn&#39;t show any growth in this chapter, in terms of personality and power. He rushes in yelling &#34;outta my way!&#34; to his allies, gets surprised by a Claw Grime, and has to be saved by Shikadai. This is a stark contrast with Boruto, who showed up in the sequel with a totally new attitude and (it seems) impressive new powers.



 Kawaki Cannot Replace Boruto 
          

This portrayal of Kawaki as inept and bland is potentially deliberate and makes a thematic statement about the nature of Kawaki&#39;s character and his inherently tragic storyline. Although Kawaki wished to take Boruto&#39;s place, this presentation in the early chapters of Two Blue Vortex seems to establish that Kawaki is unworthy of replacing Boruto. Kawaki may have changed reality, but he can only do so much to change himself and Boruto at their most fundamental level. Even in a rewritten reality, Kawaki seems destined to be outclassed and surpassed by Boruto. It remains a distinct possibility that Kawaki himself realizing this fact will finally drive some character development in future chapters of Two Blue Vortex.
