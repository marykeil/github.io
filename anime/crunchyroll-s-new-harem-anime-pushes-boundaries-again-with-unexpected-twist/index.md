## Literature Review

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You has always been absurd, and it&#39;s now pushing its boundaries even further.




Warning: Spoilers for The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You episode #10.One of the biggest selling points of the new Crunchyroll anime The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You has always been its willingness to push boundaries. The fact that it actually follows through on its harem element is one thing, but it’s always going to absurd lengths with its humor and overall storytelling, and that’s helped make it a standout hit of the fall 2023 season.




The 100 Girlfriends has pushed the boundaries of anime from day one, and the latest episode has taken that idea even further. Episode #10, “Love Mission: Impossible”, has Rentaro and his girlfriends try to free Hakari from the grasp of her mother, Hahari, before she’s forcibly separated from them, but Rentaro ultimately fails to save her.

          

What’s especially notable about episode #10, however, is the ending, as not only does it take things in an absurd direction for the anime and its genre, but it also sets up the exact sort of storytelling people can expect from the series, going forward.

                  What&#39;s New On Crunchyroll In Fall 2023   The Fall 2023 season of anime is about to start, and here are all the new anime people can expect to watch on Crunchyroll throughout the season.   





 100 Girlfriends Adds An Adult To Its Harem In The Most Ridiculous Way 
Rentaro&#39;s 6th Girlfriend, Hahari Hanazono
          

The way that The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You episode #10 continues to push boundaries is with the latest addition to Rentaro’s harem. As Rentaro and Hahari debated what was best for Hakari, Rentaro finally locked eyes with Hahari and triggered the anime’s trademark “zing”, making Hahari one of his soulmates. The fact that the anime is seriously adding an adult to Rentaro’s harem is one thing, as harem anime usually keep all realistic options in the same age group as the protagonist, but making her the mother of one of Rentaro’s other girlfriends is absolutely absurd and completely on-brand for the anime.



 100 Girlfriends’ New Harem Member Shows How Far The Anime Can Go 
The Rentaro Family Will Get Even Crazier
          




Another noteworthy detail about Hahari joining the harem in The 100 Girlfriends is that it shows just how few limits the anime has with its premise. As absurd as the anime had been in previous episodes, it still seemed to limit its harem to quirky girls in Rentaro’s age group, but Hahari changes that. Definitively adding an adult to the harem, and one who’s the mother of another member, shows that there are no limits to the types of girls who will join Rentaro’s harem, and that leaves plenty of room for future episodes to be as ridiculous as possible.

The promotional poster for the anime also leans into the idea of the harem getting increasingly absurd, teasing a lot more girlfriends for Rentaro, with some dressed as maids, one dressed as a bard, and one wielding a sword, so it’s clear that Hahari being an adult in Rentaro’s harem is just the start of how crazy the girls will get. There’s a lot of promise for The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You to get even more absurd and over-the-top than it already is, and with any luck, it’ll have the chance to show off all of that on Crunchyroll in the future.
