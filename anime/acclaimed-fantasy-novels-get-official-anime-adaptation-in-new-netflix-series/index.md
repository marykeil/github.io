## Literature Review

A new trailer has revealed that Baku Yumemakura&#39;s Onmyoji stories will be coming soon to Netflix in its first-ever animated adaptation.





The new anime likely faces some difficulty with international recognition, as it shares many similarities with an unrelated videogame of the same name. Studio Marvy Jack will also be under scrutiny for its first standalone production, which hopefully will be up to fans&#39; standards.





 

Nonetheless, the Heian era of Japan is an uncommon setting for anime, which ought to make it stand out enough among a sea of other fantasy tales.

                  Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&#39;s Voice Cast Shines in Hilarious New Clip From Netflix   A new clip from the much-anticipated anime Scott Pilgrim Takes Off has arrived and gives the cast from the 2010 film a chance to shine in their roles.   


 Onmyoji Brings Heian-era Japan Back To TV 
          

The official synopsis of the series is the following:


In prosperous ancient Kyoto, court musician Minamoto Hiromasa, grandson of Emperor Daigo, visits the residence of the official onmyoji — the yin-yang diviners — in hopes of unraveling the mysteries of the demons that disturb the city. While there, he is introduced to a man perfectly suited for untangling these enigmas: the great onmyoji Abe Seimei, a man cloaked in an otherworldly aura. Hiromasa is vexed by Seimei’s lack of interest in the mundane world and his reluctance to help, but the two of them confront the demons at the cause of the incidents. They eventually find the onmyoji Ashiya Doman, who lurks in the shadows of the demons. Seimei and Hiromasa are joined by Hiromasa’s flute teacher Imperial Prince Atsumi, the emperor’s onmyoji Kamo Yasunori, and Lady Tsuyuko, who comes to accompany them as a result of a particular case. As their emotions intertwine like threads, will Seimei and Hiromasa be able to restore peace to the capital?





Abe Seimei is a popular figure in Japanese fiction as a pseudo-historical sorcerer, in the same way Aleister Crowley is often name-dropped as a &#34;real life&#34; wizard in Western media. Seimei has appeared in all sorts of historical fantasies, including Baku Yumemakura&#39;s short stories that the new anime is adapting. Onmyoji has existed since 1986, with Yumemakura also penning a trio of full-length novels between 2000 and 2008. While the franchise is popular enough to have all manner of live-action adaptations and even a manga, it hadn&#39;t received an anime till now. While Onmyoji is well known in Japan, Netflix is betting big on international attention.

The oddest issue is that Onmyoji shares its name with a mobile phone game from 2016 with the same title and setup, which has also turned into its own franchise about Abe Seimei. There is a strong possibility of confusion for viewers expecting another show. Marvy Jack is also betting big on this series. While the studio has operated since 2003, they have only served as a support studio that provides background art and key animation. Still, judging from the trailer, the animation and artwork are of a high standard, and the show seems to have all the elements that appeal to anime fans, including great action sequences and a cast of quirky and memorable characters.




Onmyoji faces many unknowns, both with an uncertain audience and an untested studio. Nonetheless, the trailer shows promise, with its flashy supernatural battles and exorcisms. If Marvy Jack succeeds, it will certainly get clout as the first one to turn the popular novel series into an anime. The Heian era doesn&#39;t receive much attention, with most anime choosing to focus on modern-day Japan. Visiting such a period is a return to classic fantasy, which in itself feels rare these days. Onmyoji hits Netflix on November 28, and viewers should keep an eye out if they want a truly one-of-a-kind anime.
