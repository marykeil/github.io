## Literature Review

My Hero Academia re-establishes just how menacing its final antagonist All for One truly is with his terrifyingly dark backstory.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #407 of My Hero Academia. My Hero Academia has finally uncovered the terrifying origins of its diabolical antagonist All For One and it is darker than anything fans could have ever imagined. The series finally explores All For One&#39;s birth and early childhood and may be a harbinger of the darker tone the series may adopt going forward.




Chapter #407 of My Hero Academia reveals that All For One and his brother Yoichi were orphaned as infants as their mother passed away soon after giving birth to them, leaving the two to fend for themselves. The chapter is uncharacteristically graphic and gory as it goes on to discuss how both the mother&#39;s corpse and the twins were almost gnawed on by rats, adding to Yoichi and All For One&#39;s tragic origin story.

          

While My Hero Academia has no shortage of tragic backstories and dark villain origin stories, the tragic circumstances accompanied by the eerily hyper-realistic art style of the chapter help his backstory stand out as one with a distinct tone, the likes of which the series has never displayed before.

  2:09                       My Hero Academia&#39;s Massive Reveal Changes The Series&#39; Lore Forever   My Hero Academia has just revealed the origins of quirks as well as the first ever quirk user, and it isn&#39;t the luminescent baby.   





 My Hero Academia Makes Its Final Antagonist More Terrifying Than Ever 
          

All For One&#39;s backstory is a true villain origin story in every sense of the word, which only gets all the more terrifying as the chapter progresses, as readers see kid AFO use the Quirk he stole from his mother to violently slaughter several soldiers. The incident takes place when All For One appears to be about three to four years old, suggesting he may be the youngest villain in the history of My Hero Academia.

Admittedly, many of My Hero Academia&#39;s villains are relatively young, but not nearly as young as All For One was, who essentially started displaying demonic tendencies at birth. It is difficult to imagine that a mere child could be capable of such malice and cold-blooded violence, which makes the incident all the more chilling. Moreover, the stunning, evocative art of the chapter paints a terrifying picture of All For One like never before as readers gaze into his cold, piercing eyes.




          

While villains like Touya, Toga, and even Shigaraki can still be dismissed as victims of their circumstances, it is difficult to say the same of All For One despite his similarly tragic beginnings. Yoichi&#39;s presence serves as the perfect sounding board to evaluate All For One&#39;s choices and mentality even as a child. All For One simply seems to be one of those antagonists born to be evil, and his malice comes across as very much a conscious choice.

                  My Hero Academia&#39;s Real Reason Toga Has No Villain Name is Incredibly Tragic   In My Hero Academia chapter #393, Himiko Toga explains why she doesn&#39;t want a super villain name, but knowing her past makes her answer even sadder.   

The chapter also shows the exact moment when All For One decided to become the &#34;Demon Lord&#34;, as he was inspired by the same superhero comics that his brother was reading, even if they had the opposite effect on Yoichi, making him into a hero who started the legacy of One For All. All the same, My Hero Academia has certainly taken on a much darker tone with the latest chapter, and as nightmarish as it may be, the change is certainly as refreshing as it is surprising. More importantly, My Hero Academia has done an excellent job of re-establishing All For One&#39;s influence and malicious presence as an antagonist, perfectly setting the stage for the epic final battle of the series.
