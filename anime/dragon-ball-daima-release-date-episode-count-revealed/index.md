## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Daima&#39;s release date and number of episodes was just unofficially revealed in an interview with a Toei Animation executive.




In a surprising unofficial announcement from a high-ranking executive in Toei Animation, Dragon Ball DAIMA&#39;s release date has been confirmed alongside its episode count. Dragon Ball DAIMA was announced on October 12, 2023, at New York Comic-Con. Fans will have to wait for an official confirmation, but the source is reputable, so the news is most likely accurate.




In an interview with Produ, Daniel Castaneda, Toei Animation Latin America’s Licensing Director, revealed that Dragon Ball DAIMA will air in October 2024. Although the exact release date isn&#39;t known, it is more specific than the previously announced release date of Fall 2024.


 

Furthermore, he revealed that Dragon Ball DAIMA will be slated to have 20 episodes. He also revealed very exciting information about the production and dubbing of the show.

 Dragon Ball DAIMA Releases In October 2024 With 20 Episodes 

 




Daniel Castaneda said that Dragon Ball DAIMA will break the long-standing tradition of releasing the dubbed version of an anime months after its airing. This time, there will be a worldwide release of the series in multiple languages such as English, Spanish, and more. This is incredible news as this move ensures that no fan will have to wait for the series to be released in their preferred language while others will be enjoying it in the Japanese subtitled version. The Dragon Ball franchise is extremely popular in Latin America and contributed greatly to its global popularity, so this decision ensures that Spanish-speaking viewers will be one of the first to watch.

Castaneda also said that production of the series is already underway, and he expects it to conclude in May 2024. With plenty of time to spare before the anticipated release date, Dragon Ball DAIMA can be revised as many times as needed to ensure that it exceeds expectations and avoids the pitfalls of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s occasionally lackluster animation. With more than usual supervision from the creator of the Dragon Ball franchise Akira Toriyama, fans can rest easy that the displayed quality seen in the trailer will be present in the 20 episode long show.





“Usually all the productions we have are first released in Japan and about six months later we release them internationally because we wait until we have 26 chapters to start dubbing and so on; and we can now release them in other territories. This is the first time we are going to launch a worldwide series at the same time. Production is already underway and I estimate that we will have it finished around May of next year.


Dragon Ball DAIMA is a completely original series that returns to its roots. With Goku and his gang turned into children by a wish from unknown villains, they go on an exciting adventure to not only find the perpetrators but also turn themselves back to normal. With Goku&#39;s new look that was last seen in 1984, the series promises to silence all critics who wanted the return of Dragon Ball Super instead. As we wait for official confirmation from Toei Animation, it has been more or less confirmed that Dragon Ball DAIMA will be released in October 2024 and will have 20 episodes.
