## Literature Review

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is here, and it has all the fights fans have come to love from the franchise. Here&#39;s the ranking of every fight in the anime.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off!Netflix&#39;s new hit anime Scott Pilgrim Takes Off features some of the most epic fights in the whole franchise. When it first premiered, the anime was hit with a bit of controversy as it strayed away from what fans expected. Rather than a direct adaptation of the graphic novels, the series ended up being something completely new as it reinvented the story completely. The direction was divisive among audiences, but one thing everyone could agree on was the anime delivered on the fights.
Before the anime officially hit Netflix, producers for Takes Off were hyping up the fights as epic in scale that would &#34;cost more than Avatar&#34; if filmed in live-action. Now that the series is here, it&#39;s easy to see what they mean. The use of animation mixed with careful choreography helped bring the style of Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley&#39;s iconic elements from the original graphic novels to life in new ways. Some turned out better than others, but the overall execution of these battles gave fans some of the franchise&#39;s best action scenes. Without further ado, here&#39;s how every fight in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off ranks against each other.









 








 7  Julie Powers vs. Lucas Lee &amp; Gideon Graves 
From Episode 6: WHODIDIT
        

The unfortunate thing about this fight is that it ends before it&#39;s able to really start. It&#39;s simply a quick joke thrown in to show just how angry Julie is after discovering that Gideon Graves and Lucas Lee have completely trashed her house. Ramona actually tells her that it would be best to stop the fighting and settle matters like adults, which shows her growth over the course of the series. Julie is a character that barely gets featured in most Scott Pilgrim media, but Takes Off actually managed to give her a bigger presence in the story. It would have been fun to see her finally throw a punch and get into a fight of her own, but the fact that she never gets to participate in any fighting is a bit disappointing.





 6  Wallace Wells vs. Envy Adams 
From Episode 5: Lights. Camera. Sparks?!
        

 The fight between Wallace and Envy is actually a pretty genius way to pit the two against each other. When Envy learns that her boyfriend, Todd Ingram, has been having an affair with Wallace while shooting the in-universe Scott Pilgrim movie, the two challenge each other to a fight. However, rather than throw fists at one another, they get their stunt doubles to do it for them, one of which being Ramona Flowers. It&#39;s a hilarious way to go about the concept, since they&#39;re not the types to fistfight. However, the overall execution of the battle is a bit lacking. Compared to other fights in the series, it feels just like a normal challenge without any real gimmicks to set it apart. It&#39;s amusing, but it could have included way more of the ridiculous scenarios that the Scott Pilgrim series is known for to give a fight between Envy and Wallace the perfect execution.





 5  Scott Pilgrim vs. Matthew Patel 
From Episode 1: Scott Pilgrim&#39;s Precious Little Life
        

This is the fight that&#39;s the absolute closest to any that happened in the original comics and the 2010 film. Very little is changed, save for a few small details, as Matthew and Scott battle each other for the first time in the Rockit. However, the thing that makes this fight stand out more than others is the twist it has in store for fans of the franchise. Rather than Scott easily defeating Patel, the latter instead defeats him in a shocking subversion of expectations. Even the characters can&#39;t believe what they see as Matthew Patel looks around and realizes that he actually won the battle. It may be a simple fight that calls back to a lot of what came before, but the moment the rug is pulled out from under the audience is what will live on for most fans as the moment that changed everything for the Scott Pilgrim franchise.





 4  Lucas Lee vs. the Paparazzi 
From Episode 4: Whatever


 







This fight takes full advantage of featuring not just one but two of Lucas Lee&#39;s biggest interests in the same sequence: skateboarding and filmmaking. It&#39;s a beautifully orchestrated chase sequence that doubles as a fight as Lucas Lee fends off a band of ninja paparazzi with his skateboard. However, it doesn&#39;t end there. Iconic film characters such as the Xenomorph from Alien and Bruce the Shark from Jaws make cameo appearances as they hunt down Lee in a large-scale battle. The amount of Easter Eggs mixed in with the insane amount of enemies Lucas has to fight off make this one of Takes Off&#39;s most epic battles, as well as one of the coolest fight scenes in any Scott Pilgrim story.

 3  Gideon Graves vs. Matthew Patel 
From Episode 2: A League of Their Own
        

Fresh off of his victory against Scott Pilgrim, this fight between Matthew Patel and Gideon Graves was the first major step the series made in showing that the story would be different from how fans perceived it would be. When he discovers that the whole League under Gideon is a lie as he uses the Exes to get to Ramona himself, Patel challenges Graves to the ultimate duel in which the winner will take ownership of everything Gideon owns. What follows is a battle that&#39;s as epic as it is chaotic. It&#39;s an interesting combination of tech vs. magic, with Gideon launching every weapon he has at his foe. However, Matthew Patel manages to show off a moveset that he never got to use in his brief appearances from the comics and film. He uses his Demon Hipster Chicks more, and actually forms a second set of arms to overthrow Gideon and become the new leader of the League of Evil Exes. It&#39;s an epic fight that works on every level, giving Matthew Patel a moment to shine while also sending Gideon to his lowest point, which opens him up to deeper character development.





 2  Even Older Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone 
From Episode 8: The World vs. Scott Pilgrim


 







The final fight in the anime ends the show with a bang. This epic confrontation pits everyone in Scott and Ramona&#39;s life up against his future self as he attempts to put an end to his relationship with Ramona once and for all, allowing everyone to show off their powers. Whether it&#39;s one of the Evil Exes using their abilities or Knives Chau jumping at Even Older Scott one-on-one, it&#39;s a brawl that&#39;s as beautiful as it is unforgettable as every returning character and their movie cast counterpart gets a chance to duel. Plus, there are some clever little nods for fans of the franchise if they know where to look during the fight, including Knives getting the highlights punched out of her hair like Todd Ingram did to her in the original story.





 1  Roxie Richter vs. Ramona Flowers 
From Episode 3: Ramona Rents a Video
        

Out of all the fights throughout the anime, none have come as close to perfection as episode 3&#39;s battle between Ramona and her ex-girlfriend Roxie. It uses the animated medium to its fullest potential by plunging them into countless old school movies as they fight in a video store. Whether they&#39;re in the Wild West or on a crashing plane in a war film, the constant changes in scenery make for some incredible set pieces as the two battle it out. What stands out the most about it though, is the climax of the fight, as Ramona realizes the emotional weight she placed on Roxie when she left her. It gives some much-needed background on their relationship in college through brief flashbacks, setting up the direction the show would head in later episodes as she confronts her exes and the pain they felt after their break-up. This one moment perfectly sums up what Scott Pilgrim Takes Off does best, and it&#39;s easily the best fight in the whole anime.
