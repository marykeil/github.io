## Literature Review

Sports anime are some of the most compelling in the medium, but only a few are great enough to be called the best (and have major impacts on sports).





The best sports anime series deliver compelling character histories, challenges, and victories. They also deliver on important themes like friendship, loss, family, and dedication. If all of that wasn&#39;t enough, the top ranks of sports anime have also captured enough acclaim and devotion to not only be recognized as the best of their subgenre... but be seen among the top anime of all time.









 








 10  The Prince of Tennis 


 







Although reactions to The Prince of Tennis may not be as universally positive as others, it remains a perfect sports anime for newcomers. Beginning as a manga which was serialized from 1999 to 2008, the series follows young tennis player Ryoma Echizen as he excels beyond his competition, quickly becoming a certified tennis ace. At the same time, following his school&#39;s efforts to win a team championship.
The plot is very straightforward, and while the cast of characters may not be as fleshed out as other sports anime, The Prince of Tennis still manages to be one of the best-selling manga series and most popular sports anime series of all time. Long-time fans of the genre might find it less nuanced, but for viewers new to sports anime, it&#39;s a great introduction.





 9  Initial D 
        

Perfect for fans of the Fast and Furious series (particularly before it shifted from street racing to secret agent superheroics), Initial D centers on the same Japanese street racing the film series emulated for Tokyo Drift. Beginning as a manga in 1995 from Shuichi Shigeno, the series exploded into numerous anime stories, divided into &#34;Stages.&#34;
Though many viewers were introduced to the series through its popularity as meme fodder online, the tale of Takumi Fujiwara on his mission to become a respected racer is hard to beat in its genre. With incredible driving sequences and an upbeat soundtrack, Initial D is a thrilling and underrated anime, sticking to its lane every step of the way.
            
 
 Naruto&#39;s Creator Confirms the Surprising Inspiration For The Most Iconic Jutsu 
Naruto&#39;s creator, Masashi Kishimoto, revealed in an interview that his most iconic jutsu was inspired by Yoshihiro Togashi&#39;s first hit manga.








 8  Yuri on Ice 


 







Yuri on Ice debuted in 2016 to a warm welcome, following its hero Yuri Katsuki, a figure skater trying to decide what his future in competition will hold. During his journey he rediscovers his passion for skating, as well as love. While not as old as some other iconiuc sports anime, the series enraptured not just the usual anime crowd, but also professional skaters, too (gaining popularity when its choreography and soundtracks made the leap into real-world figure skating). The heart, struggles, and emotion of the show, as well as its uncommon sport of focus, guarantee it will remain a must-watch for years to come.





 7  Yowamushi Pedal 
        

Yowamushi Pedal first aired in 2013, but had already garnered fans due to its success as a manga series still being serialized after its 2008 debut. Spanning 84 volumes and airing five seasons, the series follows Sakamichi Onoda, who joins a bicycle racing club. The award-winning series from TMS Entertainment has stood out not only for focusing on cycling, but also the appeal of the otaku protagonist. With plenty of humor and heart, Yowamushi Pedal is a series that anime watchers should take a chance on (if they aren&#39;t hooked already).





 6  Kuroko&#39;s Basketball 


 







Created first as a manga by Tadatoshi Fujimaki in 2008, Kuroko&#39;s Basketball is a stand-out series for breaking typical sports manga conventions. It follows the titular character, Tetsuya Kuroko, as he joins up with a basketball team hoping to become the top contender at the high school level. While initially seeming typical, the series blends magical action with sports tropes and plot beats. The players each seem to have their own superpowers, allowing the games to feel extra suspenseful and intriguing. The broad cast of characters are also motivated in compelling ways, while the main hero is an unexpected and very quiet star. Kuroko&#39;s Basketball is a must-see anime that blends traditional sports anime with fantasy-esque elements.





 5  Ace of Diamond 
        

Ace of Diamond is another series that began as a manga (2006 - 2015) before being adapted into an anime by Madhouse and Production I.G., first airing in 2013 (and spawning multiple sequel series and manga since). The hero of the story is Eijun Sawada, who wants to be a star pitcher, or an &#39;ace&#39; on the baseball diamond. The series provides personal competition as teammates compete to become an ace, as well as the usual ups and downs of a season of league baseball. With a cast of characters outfitted with big dreams and engrossing baseball action, Ace of Diamond needs to be on the watchlists of any baseball fan, and anime fan besides.





 4  Haikyu!! 


 







Haikyu!! is one of the best known sports manga and anime of the modern era - and it&#39;s no wonder why. Another Production I.G series, this manga turned anime follows Shoyo Hinata, whose determination and team-building throughout the series make the tale a stand-out (despite how young it is relative to other hit sports anime). Haikyu!! has won several awards, and though it has concluded, it is worth jumping into sooner than later. Hinata&#39;s perseverance and struggles, as well as the camaraderie that builds into success, makes this a must-watch sports anime.





 3  Major 
        

While less widely known or cited than some other modern sports anime, Major deserves a spot on this list. First launching as a manga by Takuya Mitsuda and serialized from 1994 to 2010, followed by an anime airing in 2004, this baseball anime follows Goro Honda, who strives to be a professional pitcher like his father. What makes it unique is the length of the story, taking Goro from his early years playing the sport all the way to the major leagues.
While demonstrating a progression far beyond one championship or season, Major has all the hallmarks sports fans love, but also enjoys a fan base including all-star MLB pitcher and hitter, Shohei Ohtani. The major league player has mentioned his love for the series in interviews, proving it isn&#39;t just a compelling story, but an inspiring one for aspiring athletes of all ages.





 2  Hajime no Ippo 


 







Created by George Morikawa as a manga in 1989, Hajime no Ippo has often been compared to Rocky. This underdog hero is Ippo Makunouchi, who enters the world of boxing when a professional boxer interrupts one of many instances of bullying in the young man&#39;s life. After Ippo learns how to box, the heart of the story comes from rivalries, character interactions, and the growth that Ippo undergoes as a result.
Like the titular hero of Rocky or The Karate Kid, the hero in this anime is an underdog in a combat sport, who learns about himself and others the stronger he gets. Fans of either film should give Hajime no Ippo a chance, as the series has proven it can resonate long-term with audiences.





 1  Slam Dunk 
        

In 1990, mangaka Takehiko Inoue debuted what would become one of the most beloved sports manga, and eventually anime, in the world. Beginning with Toei Animation in 1993, the most recent film of the series The First Slam Dunk was still a box office hit. Slam Dunk is credited with increasing basketball&#39;s popularity in Japan, making it one of the most influential sports stories in manga and anime... if not the most influential of all-time.
The series follows Hanamichi Sakuragi, an intimidating, trouble-making gang leader who hopes to impress a girl by learning how to play basketball. His journey to becoming an accomplished player and leader of his championship team is already etched in anime history, so if any anime fan has yet to see it, it&#39;s a wrong to right sooner than later.
