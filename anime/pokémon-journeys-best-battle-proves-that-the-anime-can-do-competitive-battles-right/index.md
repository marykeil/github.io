## Literature Review

One battle in Pokémon Journeys captured almost every element of competitive battling perfectly, showcasing how a battle should look in the anime.




The Pokémon anime often has its own unique take on Pokémon battles, but there&#39;s one battle in Pokémon Journeys that is an almost perfect recreation of the games, and it&#39;s one of the most compelling fights in the series. It&#39;s not some important battle for badges, however, but just one of Ash&#39;s many matches on his way to the top of the World Coronation Series.




In the episode &#34;Ultra Exciting from the Shocking Start!&#34;, Ash meets up with Volkner, a gym leader in Sinnoh region, but more importantly, is currently the rank 27 trainer in the World Coronation Series.

          

Ash and Volkner have met before when Ash had battled him for a gym badge, but it&#39;s been a long time since then, and Ash has grown greatly as a trainer. Volkner is no slouch either, however, and he has picked up quite a few new tricks since the first time they battled.


 Ash and Volkner&#39;s Battle Uses A Wide Array of Pokémon Techniques 
          

As an Electric-type gym leader, Volkner&#39;s team does pose something of a challenge to Ash, who can&#39;t rely quite so heavily on Pikachu as usual. Volkner opens with a Luxray using Electric Terrain, an ability that boosts the power of Electric-type moves and prevents Pokémon from falling asleep for several turns. He then follows that up with Rising Voltage, a move that is twice as powerful when used on Electric Terrain. Both Ash and Volkner aren&#39;t afraid to switch out Pokémon, meaning that the match-ups are constantly changing. Ash swaps his Lucario for Gengar, prompting Volkner to switch for his Fan Rotom.




With Rotom, Volkner attempts to use the combo of paralysis plus Hex (a Ghost move that deals extra damage to Pokémon who are under a status condition) against Gengar, knocking it out. Ash uses Pikachu, but Volkner swaps for Electivire, which uses its ability to absorb Pikachu&#39;s electricity, growing faster without taking damage. Volkner&#39;s strategy is working very well at this point, and he&#39;s made use of Terrain, abilities, and status conditions, something that&#39;s rarely seen in one single battle. The battle comes down to Pikachu vs. Electivire, and Pikachu uses a Z-move to finish the job, winning Ash the match.



 The Pokémon Anime Can Have Real Competitive Battles Too 
          

​​​​​​​

The battle really feels like a match between two top-ranked trainers, with such a wealth of different powers and abilities on display. Volkner&#39;s strategy was a solid one that would&#39;ve worked well against many other trainers, but Ash was here specifically to challenge Electric vs. Electric, always having planned to end the match with Pikachu&#39;s Z-move. The battle makes for a compelling watch, and the episode doesn&#39;t have any irrelevant subplots dragging it down; it&#39;s just one fantastic match-up between skilled trainers that looks like the games brought to life.




The Volkner battle set the stage for many of Ash&#39;s later match-ups against top-ranked trainers, and was something of a blueprint for the battles seen in the Masters Eight tournament at the series&#39; end. Pokémon Journeys managed to bring a game-tier battle to life in the anime, proving it&#39;s possible for anime battles to mirror their video game origins.
