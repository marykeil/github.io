## Literature Review

Dorohedoro has been announced to receive a new season, more than 4 years after its successful first installment.




Netflix&#39;s Dorohedoro has been confirmed to return for a second season after more than 4 years on hiatus. This dark and gritty anime has been praised for its excellent and innovative use of CGI and for its bizarre tones and characters.




The first season aired from January 12, 2020, to March 13, 2020, with a total episode count of 13, and it was exclusively on Netflix. Adapting the brilliant manga by Q Hayashida, the anime was successful but didn&#39;t get a second season until 4 years later.


 

A second season of Dorohedoro has been confirmed to be in production by the official website of the anime. Even if there is no other information available at the moment, this was still a great announcement for fans of the series who have been waiting for many years for any information regarding the project.

                  Netflix&#39;s Dorohedoro Needs a Second Season To Answer its Biggest Mystery   The odd afflictions of its main character Caiman and the amnesia that befalls all crucial players demand a follow up to Dorohedoro season one.    





 Dorehodoro Returns For Another Bloody And Weird Adventure 
Based on the manga by Q Hayashida, produced by MAPPA
          

Animated by MAPPA Studios, the team behind Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, Vinland Saga, and more, this series is about Caiman, a human whose head has been turned into that of a lizard, who goes on the hunt for the sorcerer responsible. With the help of his friend Nikaido, a chef and owner of The Hungry Bug, he journeys all over Hole, a ruthless megacity with no laws, to kill the sorcerer and undo his magic. Their adventure is filled with injustice, deaths, and plot twists. Dorohedoro&#39;s gritty and bizarre setting made it truly stand out, along with the bloody and brutal action.

          




A message from the creator of the series was also released. She confirmed that the anime was in the works for some time, meaning that fans might see the adventures of Nikaido and Caiman sooner than they thought. As one of the darkest and most violent manga ever, the anime did a great job of bringing to life the essence of the series with its unique and visually appealing use of 3-D and CGI that perfectly balanced the traditional 2-D art style.



I couldn’t be happier to have the continuation of the “Dorohedoro” anime made! I would like to thank everyone involved in this project. The production has been in progress for quite some time now, and I have been looking forward to watching it. I know it’s been a while since the first season, but I hope you will come back to the world of “Dorohedoro” anime.


- Q Ayashida, author of Dorehodoro




MAPPA working on Dorohedoro might mean that other series will take a backseat. The studio recently announced a third season of Jujutsu Kaisen and a Chainsaw Man movie, while fans of Vinland Saga are still waiting for a season 3 announcement. Hopefully, this doesn&#39;t mean that the studio continues to take on more work than it can handle, as highlighted by the recent Jujutsu Kaisen animators crisis. Regardless, this is a terrific development as Dorohedoro is an icon in the seinen genre and fans of the series will finally be rewarded after four years of patience.
