## Literature Review

Tsundere, or harsh characters with a secret soft side, are some of the most beloved and recognizable character types in anime.





Much like popular bishounen anime heroes, a typical anime ensemble cast often features a tsundere character, though fans may not even know it. For example, the cast member who is frequently scowling or sitting in a corner, but gets flustered the moment their crush speaks to them, is almost certainly a tsundere. There are so many delightful examples of this character type to discover, for anime newcomers and seasoned fans alike.









 








 10  Kurogane 
Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle
        

Tsubasa&#39;s hardened ninja Kurogane is every inch the tsundere. In service to Princess Tomoyo, he only agrees to assist Syaoran&#39;s crew on their journey because she wishes it. He has a secret soft spot for his ragtag group, and often goes out of his way to protect its younger members. Most notable is his relationship with the enigmatic wizard Fai: though they often butt heads, Kurogane cares about him deeply and wants Fai to confront his troubled past. In one of Tsubasa&#39;s most climactic scenes, Kurogane cuts off his entire arm to save Fai&#39;s life. Of course, Kurogane shrugs this sacrifice off like it&#39;s nothing, ever true to his tsundere nature.





 9  Shintaro Midorima 
Kuroko&#39;s Basketball
        

Shutoku High School&#39;s Midorima is one of the strongest characters in Kuroko&#39;s Basketball, and with his neurotic training regimen, it&#39;s no wonder. In fact, he&#39;s so devoted to perfecting his technique that one would hardly think he has time to care about his teammates. Surprisingly, he does soften around point guard Kazunari Takao, whose carefree demeanor perfectly offsets Midorima&#39;s quirks. Takao is one of the few people who have seen Midorima&#39;s less composed side, and even referred to him as a &#34;dangerous wild beast&#34; during a game. Fans of Sk8 the Infinity will notice plenty of overlap between Cherry Blossom and Midorima, from his unruffled outer self to the fire he keeps under wraps.





 8  Damian Desmond 
Spy x Family
        

The son of Eden Academy&#39;s chairman, Damian is used to getting what he wants thanks to his family&#39;s wealth. Even so, his father shows little interest in him and his loneliness is palpable. He and Anya Forger have exchanged plenty of harsh words (and even a few punches), but fans suspect the two may ultimately bond and become friends. After all, they both have reasons to dislike Desmond, Sr. -- Anya due to her parents&#39; mission, and Damian because of his father&#39;s neglect. Season 2 of the hit series launched early this October, and Damian&#39;s complicated dynamic with Anya is one of the many reasons fans keep returning to the Spy x Family franchise.





 7  Syaoran Li 
Cardcaptor Sakura
        

CLAMP&#39;s Cardcaptor Sakura is beloved for many reasons, and the cold but socially awkward Syaoran is one of them. Not only is he Sakura&#39;s rival for the Clow Cards, he is also interested in her crush, Yukito Tsukishiro. Besides being a groundbreaking representation for LGBTQ&#43; anime characters, Syaoran&#39;s embarrassment around Yuki demonstrates peak tsundere behavior. Eventually, Syaoran begins falling for Sakura and pursues her instead, but his shyness around her is just as sweetly evident as it was with Yuki. For a tsundere with one of the most adorable narrative arcs, Cardpcator Sakura is a must-watch.





 6  Yuri Plisetsky 
Yuri!!! On Ice
        

Competitive figure skater Yuri Plisetsky has been called ethereal on the ice, but in person he is a cantankerous picture of teen angst. It&#39;s revealed throughout the series that Yuri desperately wants the attention of Viktor Nikiforov, who seems far more interested in Yuri Katsuki (the &#34;other&#34; Yuri). For all his ferocity, Yuri is quite sweet and loving towards his grandfather, Nikolai, who has always been his greatest supporter. In fact, his short program is centered around his love for Nikolai, though anyone on the wrong end of this tsundere&#39;s foul mouth would hardly believe it.





 5  Rei Hino / Sailor Mars 
Sailor Moon
        

The second Sailor Guardian to be discovered, Rei&#39;s hotheaded demeanor aligns with her fire powers perfectly. Rei is completely different in the manga, but her stubborn personality in the anime makes for plenty of entertainingly petty arguments with Usagi Tsukino. In spite of this, Rei is an unwaveringly loyal member of the Sailor Scouts, and her insults are, in a roundabout way, a means of showing affection. It&#39;s clear that this popular tsundere views Usagi like a sister -- someone to boss around on occasion, but also to protect to the ends of the earth.





 4  Kurisu Makise 
Steins;Gate
        

A genius and member of Okabe&#39;s Future Gadget Lab, Kurisu is typically calm and collected, but her demeanor shifts drastically depending on how others treat her. She can be shy, friendly, or deeply sarcastic based on the context -- most notably, when she is directing a snarky comeback at Daru for a creepy remark. Hilariously, whenever Okabe or Daru call her a tsundere, her reaction only proves their point, from blushing madly or declaring outright, &#34;I am not a tsundere!&#34; Whatever she may claim, Kurisu cares deeply about her team of scientists, and has even confessed her love for Okabe while drunk.





 3  Inuyasha 
Inuyasha
        

Half-dog demon Inuyasha is a textbook tsundere. His love interest, Kagome, can be just as stubborn as he is, further complicating what is already a strange dynamic (she&#39;s the reincarnation of his past love, Kikyo). He is also at odds with his aloof half-brother, Sesshomaru, and the waters of jealousy and resentment between these two run deep. Over the course of nearly 200 episodes, Inuyasha&#39;s relationship with both characters does soften a bit -- his love for Kagome even goes on to become one of the best romances in shonen anime. At the end of the day, he&#39;s still the prideful tsundere that legions of fans know and love.





 2  Asuka Langley Soryu 
Neon Genesis Evangelion
        

The headstrong pilot of the Evangelion Unit-02, Asuka&#39;s personality sharply contrasts with her soft-spoken teammate, Shinji. However, her temper is a front for deep insecurity, which viewers get to witness in both her dreams and internal monologue. In spite of the mental walls Asuka has built up, she and Shinji seem to be attracted to each other. In a classic tsundere move, she gives Shinji a kiss out of &#34;boredom,&#34; though audiences most certainly know better. Asuka&#39;s emotional complexity goes a long way towards making her a fan favorite and one of the best characters in the Evangelion franchise.





 1  Kyo Sohma 
Fruits Basket
        

As the cursed cat in the Sohma family zodiac, Kyo has been ostracized his whole life and has built up plenty of walls in response. From his tooth-and-nail fights with the rat of the zodiac, Yuki, to snapping at Tohru Honda and immediately feeling guilty, Kyo is the definitive anime tsundere. As he slowly heals from the sad things that happened to him, Kyo eventually learns to let others in, but at heart he&#39;s still a cat with claws to match. It&#39;s what makes his wholesome relationship with his mentor, Kazuma, and his blooming romantic interest in Tohru, such healing experiences for him and fans alike.
Tsundere are a prime example of why audiences are drawn to anime in the first place. In the real world, it&#39;s not always possible to understand what&#39;s going on below the surface of someone with a hot temper, or to see their more compassionate side. Thankfully, in fiction, it&#39;s almost guaranteed that viewers will gain more understanding of a well-written character, especially if they fit the tsundere mold. There&#39;s a lot to love about the best tsundere anime characters, and though they&#39;ll keep people at arm&#39;s length for a while, watching them welcome others in is the greatest reward.
