## Literature Review

There are many different Breathing Styles used in Demon Slayer, but some have greater power than others. Which Breathing Style is the best?




Warning! Spoilers for the Demon Slayer manga series below.The Breathing Styles in Demon Slayer are a big part of the series&#39; appeal, especially in the anime, where they&#39;ve been beautifully brought to life. Prospective Demon Slayers must train in at least one style in order to be recognized officially, and it&#39;s possible for a Slayer to use two or more styles. Each style is unique, and there are quite a few of themâ€“14, to be exact. Many of these styles are only utilized by a single character in the entire series, making those signature styles almost part of the character.
In considering the strength of a style, it&#39;s important to think of its users&#39; success in battle, as well as versatility, which is most easily measured by the number of forms a style is known to have. The difficulty of their use also plays a role, with simpler styles not quite as impressive as those which proved more difficult to master. Here are all 14 Demon Slayer Breathing Styles, ranked.









 








 14  Flower Breathing 
        

Flower Breathing is a style that was practiced by Kanae Kocho, the former Flower Hashira and Shinobu&#39;s sister, as well as Shinobu&#39;s adoptive sister and pupil, Kanao Tsuyuri. Unfortunately, since Kanae is dead before the series begins, not much Flower Breathing is seen in the series, which is partially responsible for its low rank. Flower Breathing is said to be derived from Water Breathing, and shares certain traits in common with it. While the numbering of the forms for this style indicates there should be at least seven, only five are used in the series, and the final form can cause blindness for the user. Kanao doesn&#39;t get a lot of focus, and as a result Flower Breathing comes across as underpowered.





 13  Insect Breathing 
        

Insect Breathing is a unique style, derived from Flower Breathing, which is practiced only by Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho. Because Shinobu isn&#39;t physically capable of decapitating most demons due to her size, this style relies heavily on poisons, mostly created from the wisteria that demons hate. Insect Breathing only has four known forms as well, limiting the options she has during battle. Shinobu&#39;s track record in battle with it is mixed, to say the least, so it seems like this style has drawbacks when fighting anyone who&#39;s aware of its poisons.





 12  Water Breathing 
        

Water Breathing is one of the five basic elemental styles, and is practiced by many characters in the series, most notably Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka and Tanjiro himself. It&#39;s considered the easiest style to learn, although &#34;easy&#34; is a very relative term. The style is based around the flow of water currents, and consists of 10 known forms, plus a special one created by Tomioka that only he knows how to use. Water Breathing definitely seems to be versatile, but it&#39;s lacking in the power department.





 11  Beast Breathing 
        

Beast Breathing is a bizarre style that was invented by the boar-headed Inosuke Hashibira, and as such is only practiced by him. It&#39;s an unusual style in that Inosuke uses two Nichirin Swords, which most demon slayers don&#39;t have access to. It has 10 forms, but given that they&#39;re all developed by Inosuke with minimal training, it&#39;s arguable whether they formally count. Beast Breathing surprisingly does have some non-combat applications, most notably his seventh form, Spatial Awareness, which lets him sense movement even miles away. It&#39;s not a sophisticated style, to be sure, but it does have raw power.





 10  Flame Breathing 
        

Another basic elemental style, Flame Breathing is most notably practiced by the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku. Flame Breathing involves emulating the flickering, burning nature of fire, and has at least nine forms, although only six are seen, and the ninth is allegedly exclusive to Kyojuro&#39;s family. As a style, it definitely has some powerful attacks, but doesn&#39;t seem particularly versatile, with none of the forms having use outside of battle. Unfortunately, Flame Breathing practitioners have a rough record on screen, pulling down what might otherwise be a very high ranking.





 9  Love Breathing 
        

Love Breathing is a style practiced exclusively by Mitsuri Kanroji, and she created it from Flame Breathing. Love Breathing has the look of elegant, graceful dance, complete with a lot of acrobatics. It has six forms, with only five shown, with one defensive and four offensive techniques. This style is designed for someone with Mitsuri&#39;s unnaturally strong body, and makes use of a whip-like sword, making it unlikely that anyone else even could learn it. Mitsuri fairs pretty well in battle over most of the series, which helps showcase her style&#39;s power.





 8  Serpent Breathing 
        

Serpent Breathing is another style practiced by one person, in this case Obanai Iguro, and descended from Water Breathing. The style is meant to copy the slithering and coiling movements of a snake. Serpent Breathing has five forms, all offensive. The fifth form stands out, however, as it&#39;s capable of generating enough power to decapitate multiple demons with a single swipe. Obanai also uses a very unusual sword, as his has a wavy blade that resembles a slithering snake. Obanai definitely proved himself to be strong, and presumably his Breathing Style is responsible for this power.





 7  Thunder Breathing 
        

Thunder Breathing is one of the basic elemental styles, practiced most notably by Zenitsu Agatsuma and his former fellow student, Kaigaku. This Breathing Style emulates the speed of a lightning strike, allowing for rapid movement. Zenitsu only knows one form, but there are actually at least six, plus an original one Zenitsu created. The sheer speed of Thunder Breathing is one of its biggest assets, and Zenitsu has proven it&#39;s possible to push that speed to the limit, getting in a dozen or more attacks in one movement. It&#39;s difficult to defend against, making it one of the more powerful styles.





 6  Wind Breathing 
        

Wind Breathing is another basic elemental style, with its main practitioner being the Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa. It uses swirling and rotating motions, like those of a cyclone, adding extra power and speed to attacks. It has nine forms, with most offensive in nature, although at least one has defensive applications. It&#39;s a surprisingly aggressive style, which is befitting of a battle-crazed slayer like Sanemi. As a Breathing Style designed around taking opponents out quickly, it&#39;s fantastically powerful when used by an expert.





 5  Sound Breathing 
        

Sound Breathing is a derivative of Thunder Breathing, used exclusively by Tengen Uzui. It does make use of loud sounds, as the name suggests, which can help break an opponent&#39;s concentration. Only three forms of Sound Breathing are known, with only one having defensive use. This style also makes use of Tengen&#39;s unusual Nichirin, which is made up of two smaller, knife-like blades joined together by a chain. He also uses literal bombs as part of this style, which is definitely one way to increase its power.





 4  Mist Breathing 
        

Mist Breathing, derived from Wind Breathing, is practiced exclusively by Muichiro Tokito. The style revolves around the obfuscating power of mist or fog, concealing one&#39;s movements to confuse the enemy. Mist Breathing has seven forms, with one of those original to Tokito himself. Tokito was able to use Mist Breathing to singlehandedly defeat an Upper Rank demon, an impressive feat if ever there was one. Mist Breathing&#39;s ability to confound foes is an extremely valuable one when fighting alone, which is often the case for Demon Slayers.





 3  Stone Breathing 
        

Stone Breathing is the last of the basic elemental styles, practiced by Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima. It&#39;s inspired by the stability of earth and stone, with many attacks using the ground in some way. Stone Breathing has five known forms, which cover both offense and defense, making it the most balanced of all. Since Gyomei uses an odd axe chained to a mace as his Nichirin blade, the techniques are pretty unusual. Gyomei is known as the strongest Hashira, and his Stone Breathing forms are a big part of why.





 2  Moon Breathing 
        

The five elemental styles all derived from one original style, but as it turns out, there&#39;s one more style derived from the original: Moon Breathing. Moon Breathing is a style practiced exclusively by the Upper One demon Kokushibo, who was once a Demon Slayer before discarding his humanity in exchange for a longer life. As such, Kokushibo never taught this technique to anyone else. Since he&#39;s had hundreds of years to train, Moon Breathing has at least 16 different forms, and quite possibly more that he never used. It&#39;s a power befitting the top-level demon, and it easily explains how Kokushibo managed to rise up and become Muzan&#39;s right-hand man.





 1  Sun Breathing 
        

Originally, there was one Breathing Style for demon slaying, known as Sun Breathing. It was developed by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, but proved too difficult for his apprentices to master. He helped them to learn and create their own styles, which became the various elemental styles. However, each of these elemental styles is only a small part of the whole that is Sun Breathing. Tanjiro&#39;s Hinokami Kagura is a type of Sun Breathing as well, and fans have certainly seen how powerful that technique can be. As the &#34;true&#34; Breathing Style, its power and utility are almost beyond questioning, making Sun Breathing an easy choice for the strongest.
Despite the rankings, most Breathing Styles seen in Demon Slayer are still extremely powerful techniques, and many of the lower-ranked abilities suffer from getting little attention more than anything else. It&#39;s also important to remember that these are just the Breathing Styles themselves, and that individual practitioners may be stronger than those who practice a &#34;better&#34; style. At the end of the day, Demon Slayer&#39;s Breathing Styles are all cool additions to the series which helped to make it what it is, regardless of how powerful they are.
