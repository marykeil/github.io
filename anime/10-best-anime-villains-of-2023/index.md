## Literature Review

The 2023 anime villains were captivating and sinister, capturing the attention of many demographics through their uniqueness. 




Every anime is significantly shaped by its villains and the shows from 2023 aren&#39;t an exception. The motivation and actions of these characters impact the entire world and, along the way, the heroes and protagonists of the anime. Some villains are sinister while others aren&#39;t so straightforward and have a more complex role.
The growth of a protagonist depends on the depth and strength of the counterpart, the villain. Enemies have different characteristics that make them unique such as Kaido&#39;s strength, Eren&#39;s moral dilemma, and Garou&#39;s determination. The villains present mental, physical, and psychological challenges to the heroes, but also provide a mirror-like experience of perils that could push the heroes into the wrong path. These often misunderstood characters are a great way for any reader to understand anime storytelling and come to a deeper understanding of iconic characters.









 








 10  Kaido Beat Luffy Three Times 
One Piece
        

Kaido is the main villain of the Wano Country Arc in One Piece. The series, created by Eiichiro Oda, has been going on since 1999 and has more than 1000 chapters and episodes. The Wano Country arc is the culmination of the Four Yonko saga that started when the Straw Hats entered the New World in episode #523. Kaido, the main villain of the arc and one of the Emperors of the Seas, was Luffy&#39;s main opponent who defeated him three times.
This was unprecedented for a shonen hero, but it led to Luffy unlocking his most iconic power-up, Gear 5. Despite his loss, Kaido will always be remembered as one of the most intimidating and powerful villains in the genre, which is a testament to how well he was built up by the author.

 9  Orochi Sold Out His Own People For Revenge 
One Piece
        

Orochi Kurozmi was the shogun of the Wano Country. He schemed his way to the top and ended by poisoning the country&#39;s former shogun and inviting Kaido to Wano. Orochi turned a once flourishing country into a cesspool that was slowly poisoning the inhabitants. The countless weapons factories made the water undrinkable and the people of the country didn&#39;t have enough food to eat. The starving population was fed with failed SMILE fruits that didn&#39;t allow people who ate them to express any emotion besides laughter.
Even worse, the sinister shogun did this only to enact a twisted revenge against the Kozuki clan, which had actually always treated him with kindness. Orochi functions as the perfect complement to Kaido in the Wano Arc, showing that evil can take different forms and motivations, some more twisted and subtle than others.

 2  Yhwach Brought Disaster to the Soul Society 
Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War
        

Yhwach is the main antagonist of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War. After the Quincy lost their first war against the Soul Society, it took Yhwach 900 years to regenerate his heart, 90 years to recover his intellect, and 9 years to recover his strength and restart the conflict. The invasion of the Soul Society decimated the Gotei 13 and brought with it a lot of casualties, including the supposedly undefeatable Head Captain Genryusai Yamamoto.
Yhwach was a little underdeveloped in the manga, because this final arc of Bleach was rushed to its conclusion due to the author&#39;s poor health conditions. However, the anime does a much better job of fleshing out Yhwach and his motivations, making him a villain worthy of concluding one of the most popular manga and anime series of all time.
