## Literature Review

Steven Blum is a legendary voice actor with decades of experience, but which of his anime roles are his very best?




Steve Blum is a legendary voice actor with decades of experience in the industry, and many of his most noteworthy roles have been anime characters. Fans in the West are also likely to recognize him as the voice of Toonami&#39;s host TOM, where he brought many classic anime series to the masses, giving many fans their first anime experiences.
Steve Blum has taken a variety of roles over the years, from serious, no-nonsense types to goofy comedic leads. He&#39;s played major characters who carry their series as well as fan-favorite side characters. No matter what kind of role, Steve Blum is sure to bring his best, and fans often rejoice when his casting is announced. Here are 10 of Steve Blum&#39;s best performances in anime over the years.









 








 10  Eikichi Onizuka is a Tough Guy Who Ended Up As A Teacher 
Series: Great Teacher Onizuka
        

Steve Blum plays the lead character of Great Teacher Onizuka, a comedic series about a former delinquent who ends up teaching high school kids. As Onizuka, Blum brought an intensity to the role befitting the hot-blooded character. The series does get serious and dramatic at times, however, and in those instances, Blum is able to turn on a dime, perfectly shifting the role while remaining in character. As the lead, Blum&#39;s performance sets the tone for the series, and it&#39;s a great fit.

 9  Guilmon is a Loyal Companion 
Series: Digimon Tamers
        

At the other end of the spectrum is Guilmon, one of the main Digimon in the series&#39; third incarnation, Digimon Tamers. Blum helps to bring the loveable dinosaur-like creature to life, and creates a believable dynamic with his human partner, Takato Matsuki. While it&#39;s quite different from many of his other roles, Guilmon is still a great performance that helps to elevate the anime. Blum also provided the voice for a few other Digimon characters over the years, but Guilmon (and its Digivolutions) is by far the most notable.

 8  Kazuma is a Hot-headed Renegade Hero 
Series: s-CRY-ed
        

In the obscure series s-CRY-ed, Blum plays the protagonist Kazuma Torisuna, user of a special ability known as an Alter which provides unique powers to each person who possesses it. Kazuma is hot-headed, rebellious, and stubborn, but is always willing to put his life on the line to help others. Blum once again brings an appropriately intense presence to the role, bringing the classic character archetype to new highs in what&#39;s otherwise a rather run-of-the-mill shonen series.

 7  Orochimaru Brings Evil to a New Level 
Series: Naruto 


 







Orochimaru is a classical villain through and through, one that would be easy to go over-the-top and reduce to a cartoon caricature. Fortunately, Steve Blum&#39;s performance as the villain is able to bring some nuance to the role, ensuring that Orochimaru remains a terrifying force within the series. In Naruto&#39;s follow-up series, Boruto, Orochimaru even gets some level of redemption, allowing Blum to bring a new side to the role which was previously all evil. Every scene with Orochimaru is tense, and it&#39;s all thanks to Blum&#39;s performance. Honorable mention to Blum&#39;s performance as Zabuza as well.

 6  Kyogai Can Make You Cry for a Demon 
Series: Demon Slayer
        

One of the first major demons encountered in Demon Slayer is the drum demon, Kyogai. Kyogai obviously starts off as an evil villain, but Demon Slayer is fantastic at providing its villains with tragic backstories that can really make a viewer feel for them. That means the actors portraying them need to be able to bring some depth to the role, and Steve Blum was perfect casting for Kyogai. His final scenes with Tanjiro are quite moving, as he finally feels appreciated as an artist in his dying moments. Blum&#39;s performance helped to make Kyogai a memorable character despite his short time in the series.

 5  Leeron Brings Sassy Style to Giant Robots 
Series: Gurren Lagann
        

In Gainax&#39;s Gurren Lagann, Blum portrays the supporting character, Leeron Littner, a mechanic who works on the series&#39; mecha. Leeron&#39;s expertise is essential to the protagonists&#39; goals of reclaiming the surface, so he&#39;s got a fairly significant role. Leeron is known for being rather flamboyant, and that&#39;s something that could easily have gone awry in the hands of a less-experienced voice actor. Blum manages to balance the silly and serious sides of Leeron to create a complex character that helps to exemplify Gurren Lagann&#39;s themes.

 4  Kyohei is a Cool and Collected Hero 
Series: Durarara
        

Blum&#39;s character in Durarara is the memorable Kyohei Kadota, a member of the &#34;gang&#34; known as the Dollars, a mysterious group in Ikebukuro. Kyohei is a calm-natured high schooler who has a distaste for rules and has plenty of fighting experience under his belt. Blum manages to bring some nuance to the character with his performance, avoiding the pitfalls that can cause calm characters to become dull characters. Kyohei&#39;s heroic streak helps him to stand out as well.

 3  Mugen is a Loveable Scoundrel 
Series: Samurai Champloo


 







Sister series to Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, mixes hiphop and ancient Japan to create a unique experience, and part of that is down to its iconic characters. Mugen is a rogue samurai who fights only for himself, at least until he gets tied up with Fuu, a young girl searching for her father. Mugen has a rude and vulgar attitude which Blum was able to capture exceptionally well. Especially important is his contrast with fellow lead character Jin, the colder, quieter samurai who also accompanies Fuu. Blum manages to play off of Kirk Thornton&#39;s Jin fantastically well, and their dynamic is key to the series&#39; success.

 2  Roger Smith Investigates a Forgotten City&#39;s Mysteries 
Series: The Big O
        

The Big O is a mecha series that&#39;s heavily influenced by Batman. Its wealthy protagonist with a secret identity, Roger Smith, is voiced by Blum, who controls the giant robot known as Big O, using it to fight monsters and other robots that threaten the amnesiac Paradigm City. Blum brings a stern and serious energy to the role, accompanied by a bit of that Bruce Wayne-esque playboy behavior. Roger&#39;s banter with his android partner, Dorothy, is one of the series&#39; highlights, and Blum manages it exceptionally well given Dorothy&#39;s flat and robotic personality.





 1  Spike Spiegel is The Ultimate Space Cowboy 
Series: Cowboy Bebop


 







By far, Blum&#39;s most iconic role is that of Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. It&#39;s a rare circumstance where the English dub is almost universally agreed to be the superior version, and a lot of that is thanks to the excellent casting, especially for series protagonist Spike. Spike is a complicated character--a tough guy who occasionally cracks jokes with a dark and mysterious past. That gives Blum a lot to work with in the role, and in each scene, he manages to nail the character perfectly. Over 20 years later, Cowboy Bebop is still hailed as a masterpiece of anime, and Blum played a big part in that achievement.
