## Literature Review

Pokémon Concierge&#39;s new trailer includes its release date as well as footage of its charming, stop-motion animation that helps it stand out.




Netflix gave audiences a brand new look at Pokémon Concierge, an animated series that will be releasing in December. The trailer shows off the series&#39; stop-motion animation, which gives the show a unique identity and the promise of a cozy, relaxing experience within the Pokémon world. While not a typical Pokémon anime, it looks to be another welcome addition that caters to all audiences.




The trailer, available on Netflix&#39;s YouTube channel, shows the original tropical resort setting the show will be set in, as well as the dynamic duo of the eponymous concierge and an adorable Psyduck. While the show might not be &#34;in season&#34; in most countries when it arrives on December 28, its relaxing atmosphere may be the perfect way to end 2023.


 

                  Pokémon Is Responsible For Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2&#39;s Most Controversial Scene   Some scenes in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Season 2 have sparked a lot of controversy among fans, but the blame should fall on the Pokémon anime.   


 Pokémon Concierge Is Animated By Stop-Motion Masters 
The show is produced by The Pokémon Company and dwarf studios.
         




Netflix&#39;s synopsis of the series states:



This delightful stop-motion animation tells the story of a concierge named Haru, who works at a resort just for Pokémon, and the guests who come to visit.


The brevity of the description makes it clear that this series is angled to be a lax, slice-of-life-style story, likely with self-contained episodes. Some audiences might find the stop-motion work to be familiar, with good reason: dwarf studios is also responsible for 

Rilakkuma and Kaoru, 
another Netflix series. More importantly, the staff is more than familiar with how to convincingly animate their subjects; as the trailer shows, the human puppets and Pokémon move smoothly, making the stop-motion feel all the more charming.


 If dwarf studios&#39; last work is of any indication, 

Pokémon Concierge 
might have a short runtime – 

Rilakkuma&#39;s 
two seasons had 13-minute and 15-minute long episodes, respectively, so it&#39;s not out of the question to expect the same from this project. The show&#39;s theme song is performed by Mariya Takeuchi, best known for performing the legendary city pop classic, &#34;Plastic Love&#34;. As one of the biggest names in the genre, having her lend her voice to 




Pokémon Concierge
 is a pretty clear sign that the show is easy-going.While December 28 is certainly an unusual time to release such a warm-weather show, seeing the year off with any sort of festivity is always welcome. The show should be able to attract the attention of multiple different audiences - besides 

Pokémon 
fans eager for more, those who enjoyed dwarf studios&#39; last work will be able to watch their unique stop-motion work yet again, and even the unexpected link to City Pop ought to turn some heads. The popularity of all and any of these works ought to assure Netflix that 

Pokémon Concierge
 will be a hit during the post-Christmas lull.
