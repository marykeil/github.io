## Literature Review

Berserk of Gluttony&#39;s relationship between the hero Fate Graphite and the sword Greed is not only dark but intricate and shrouded in mystery.




Warning: Spoilers for Berserk of Gluttony episode #5




A dark interpretation of the usually light-hearted magic sword trope in Crunchyroll&#39;s Berserk of Gluttony helps the new anime stand out from other similar and more established series. The close relationship between the hero Fate Graphite and his sword Greed also naturally begs many questions that provide an exciting air of mystery that the most popular anime benefit from. This effective subversion comes as Berserk of Gluttony&#39;s dark spin on another popular trope is already putting the series on everyone&#39;s watchlists.

Similar to the heroic host trope, some heroes stumble upon weapons that can communicate with only them, usually providing the wielder with critical information that will help them succeed in their epic quest. Additionally, these swords usually possess an unprecedented amount of power that separates their new masters from other heroes and foes on the battlefield.

          




This formula is followed almost too perfectly in Berserk of Gluttony, an adaptation of the light novel series Berserk of Gluttony: The One That Exceeds the Concept of Levels by writer Ichika Isshiki and illustrator fame. The difference is that the manner in which Greed comes into Fate&#39;s possession and the similarity in their powers add some extra dynamic to their relationship.


 Greed and Gluttony Steal Powers At The Detriment of Others in Berserk of Gluttony 
         

In a random and uncharacteristic show of bravery, Fate&#39;s own fate changes forever when he learns the true potential of his skill, Gluttony, which forces him to continually feast on power to avoid dying of starvation or harming those around him. Then a sword that transforms into unparalleled weapons in return for greedily stealing the stats of his owner just so happens to talk Fate into purchasing him. As the descriptions of their powers make apparent, the sword and master are one and the same, as they both greedily devour either skills or stats like gluttons at the detriment of others.




Although amusing and even friendly at times, Greed is clearly shrouded in mystery and has a tendency to withhold critical information until it&#39;s too late. For example, in episode #3, Greed fails to inform his owner that to fully benefit from his powers, Fate has to relinquish some of his stats so that his sword can transform into more powerful weapons. This, of course, happens after Fate has already gotten a taste of true power thanks to Greed, making it more difficult for him to refuse. There&#39;s also the question as to why Greed was so emphatic that Fate purchased him despite their obvious similarities.


 

The shared powers and bond between Fate and Greed were preceded by a more compelling parallel that Fate first makes when Greed&#39;s beat-up state causes him to compare it to himself. Originally just a transaction for Greed to evolve, Fate later views Greed&#39;s absorption of his newly acquired skills as a cleansing when he steals the abilities of a powerful enemy who once tormented him at the beginning of the series. Fate and Greed&#39;s symbiotic relationship and metaphorical powers are only expected to grow further as Crunchyroll continues to air Berserk of Gluttony this fall.
