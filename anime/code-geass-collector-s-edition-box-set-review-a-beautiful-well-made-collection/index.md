 Code Geass: Collector&#39;s Edition Justifies its Hefty Price Tag With Quality 
         




Though the impressive price tag might be a tall hill for some fans to climb, the collection will be more than worth it for any fan of the series with a bit of cash to throw around. The Blu-rays included do a good job of capturing the essential Code Geass experience and even come with bonus features like interviews and commentaries. However, the real appeal of Code Geass: Collector&#39;s Edition is found in more than just the Blu-rays.

The real star of the show is undoubtedly the display box itself. Prominently decorated with art of Lelouch and Suzaku, the display box&#39;s artwork is high quality and represents the series well. The artwork underneath the top of the box depicting Lelouch in white and Suzaki in black is a particularly standout piece, accurately reflecting the series&#39; grandiosity. In addition to the appealing artwork, the display box also feels sturdy. The Code Geass: Collector&#39;s Edition isn&#39;t exactly going to make it through a disaster, so a certain amount of care is cautioned when handling, but it should survive more than a few moves without issue.




                  Why Pizza Hut Is Everywhere In Code Geass   Code Geass is a popular anime series where Pizza Hut is an ever-present entity; here&#39;s why the restaurant chain is so prominent on the show.   

Beyond the display box, the included trinkets are fun items for fans of the series. The chess set in particular is a standout inclusion, as the pieces and the board all have a certain quality feel to them that shows genuine care was put into the production of the collector&#39;s edition. Similar things could be said of the sterling silver necklace, which appears well-crafted.

All in all, the Code Geass: Collector&#39;s Edition lives up to its title. While casual fans may scoff at the price tag, any mega-fan of the franchise who can afford it should be delighted by the set. The production quality of everything involved is high, and the display box itself looks gorgeous on a shelf. Code Geass: Collector&#39;s Edition might not be for everyone, but those who have been devoted to the franchise since its premiere in 2006 won&#39;t be disappointed.
