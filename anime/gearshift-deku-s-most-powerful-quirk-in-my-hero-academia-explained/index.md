# Gearshift Deku s Most Powerful Quirk In My Hero Academia Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Deku&#39;s most powerful Quirk in My Hero Academia is Gearshift, which allows him to manipulate the speed and trajectory of objects he touches.   Gearshift goes beyond ordinary super-speed Quirks, as it can bend the laws of physics and inertia, allowing Deku to move at supersonic speeds.   However, using Gearshift comes with consequences, such as immobilization and a time limit of five minutes, making it a last resort for Deku.

## Literature Review

My Hero Academia has finally revealed all of Deku&#39;s Quirks, including the Quirk of the second user called Gearshift. Here&#39;s how it works.




With the final battle against Shigaraki looming, My Hero Academia has unveiled every Quirk in Deku&#39;s arsenal, including what may be his most powerful, Gearshift. The latest chapters of My Hero Academia have finally shed light on the identity of the second user of One For All and his Quirk, which has the potential to be a game-changer in the Final War.




First officially introduced in chapter #369, Gearshift originally belonged to the second user of One For All, who has since been revealed to be Kudo. At its core, Gearshift allows Deku to alter the speed and trajectory of anything he touches, including himself. 

          

What sets it apart from an ordinary super-speed Quirk is that Gearshift allows Deku to bend the laws of physics and inertia and manipulate objects to move at supersonic, reality-bending speeds. However, while there is virtually no limit to the speeds Gearshift can achieve, the power does come with its limitations.


 Deku Uses Gearshift in the Form of Two Techniques 
Transmission and Overdrive
          




Deku&#39;s use of Gearshift primarily takes the form of two techniques—Transmission and Overdrive, which effectively enhance many of his existing attacks. Transmission allows Deku to increase the speed of his punches in levels with every successive punch. This increase in speed takes place in levels called Gears, particularly Low Gear, Second Gear, Third Gear, and Top Gear, each of which allows Deku to move faster than sound itself.

                  My Hero Academia&#39;s Deku Just Stole Luffy&#39;s Strongest Move   My Hero Academia’s Deku just stole One Piece’s Luffy trademark move, as the young hero debuts One for All’s final power: switching gears!   

Meanwhile, Overdrive uses Gearshift in conjunction with Fa Jin to thrust Deku forward at high speeds, giving him an immense boost in both speed and power. The use of Gearshift in such a way has birthed many of Deku&#39;s strongest attacks in My Hero Academia to date, such as the &#34;Quintuple Detroit Smash.&#34;



 Gearshift Comes With Heavy Consequences 
          




As powerful as Gearshift may be, it does come with a heavy risk. The recoil from moving at such high speeds can leave Deku immobilized afterward, as pointed out in chapter #406. Moreover, at present, Deku can only use Gearshift for a maximum of five minutes. These consequences of using Gearshift without exercising caution, together with the limited amount of time Deku can use it, have relegated Gearshift to a final resort.

                  My Hero Academia Brings Deku Back Full Circle With One Tragic Twist   Deku&#39;s final fight against Shigaraki in My Hero Academia brings the young hero back to his roots, before he became incredibly powerful.   

Regardless, Deku has managed to draw out the true potential of Gearshift, which has grown exponentially since fusing with One For All. Even though Gearshift started as an ineffective Quirk limited to shooting tiny objects like bullets when in Kudo&#39;s possession, it has since become the most powerful Quirk at Deku&#39;s disposal and will surely play a major role in the finale of My Hero Academia.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
