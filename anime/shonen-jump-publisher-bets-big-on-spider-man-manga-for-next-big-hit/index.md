## Literature Review

Shueisha and Marvel Comics continue to deepen their collaboration with a new series thatâ€™s sure to draw the attention of the manga and comics crowd.





As reported in Anime News Network, this month&#39;s issue of Shueisha&#39;s Saikyo Jump will feature the debut of Spider-Man: Kizuna - a brand-new ongoing manga following the adventures of a Japanese elementary student who becomes Spider-Man. While further details of the storyline were not announced before its publication, judging from the prior work of its creators, the story will likely include a fair share of high adventure mixed with humorous hijinks. The news title dropped in the October 4, 2023, issue of Saikyo Jump, which will continue to be its publishing platform thereafter.





 Shueisha Puts a Fresh Spin on Spider-Man in Exciting New Manga 

 

Spider-Man: Kizuna is based on Setta Kobayashi and Hachi Mizuno&#39;s one-shot of the same name. That story, which was published in September 2022, also appeared In Saikyo Jump. At the time Kobayashi posted a note to his X (formerly Twitter) account stating how excited he was to have the opportunity to work on a manga starring Spider-Man and how he hoped its readers would convince Shueisha or Marvel to serialize the title. While it took a few years, fan support for the Spider-Man: Kizuna one shot must have convinced Shueisha that the story deserved its own dedicated title and continuing series. More recently, Kobayashi went on to state that his aim in creating Spider-Man: Kizuna is to establish a new Japanese version of Spider-Man.



 Shueisha And Marvel Have a Long History of Successful Collaborations 
          




This is not the first time Shueisha and Marvel have collaborated. Last summer the two companies announced a manga spinoff to the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse called Spider-Man: Octopus Girl. That story follows the misadventures of Doctor Octopus who, after falling into a coma during another fight with Spider-Man, wakes up to find that he inhabits the mind and body of a Japanese middle school student. Even earlier, in 2019, the two comic publishing giants inked a deal in which a series of one-shot manga stories involving Marvel characters were produced and published on Shueisha&#39;s premier manga website Shonen Jump&#43;. That collaboration resulted in the generation of some notable titles including Sanshiro Kasama and Hikaru Uesugi&#39;s Deadpool Samurai, and Secret Reverse by Yu-Gi-Oh! author Kazuki Takahashi.

Interestingly, the 2019 Shueisha - Marvel collaboration also included a work by Mizuno entitled Avengers: Gag Reel which uses a traditional gag/prank manga style to poke fun at the usually super serious Avengers. Kobayashi is also not new to the parody scene. In 2018, he created Asta&#39;s Journey to Wizard King, a &#34;gag manga spinoff&#34; to Yuki Tabata&#39;s Black Clover. While Spider-Man is one of the most wisecracking heroes in Marvel, it certainly would be interesting to see him in an environment where everything could be a joke. If that&#39;s what Kobayashi and Mizuno are setting up Spider-Man: Kizuna as, it will definitely be a fresh new take on Marvel&#39;s classic hero from Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha.
