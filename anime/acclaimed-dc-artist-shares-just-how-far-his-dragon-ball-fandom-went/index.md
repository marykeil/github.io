## Literature Review

 DC artist Bruno Redondo did something incredible as a kid as a result of his passion for the iconic Dragon Ball manga.





Bruno Redondo is best known for his work on various DC Comics titles, including Injustice, Injustice: Gods Among Us, Nightwing, and Human Target, as well as many others. He and his work have been nominated for several Eisner awards, including three in 2023 in the categories of which he won Best Continuing Series and Best Cover Artist for Nightwing. His work with Tom King has produced a fan-favorite series with stunning artistic feats during its run. When he was a kid, Dragon Ball was actually not distributed where Redondo lived, but that did not stop him or his peers.





 Redondo&#39;s Love For Dragon Ball Created A Fascinating Personal Artifact 

 

On X, Bruno Redondo shared a copy of Dragon Ball that he and his friends made. As the comic was hard to get in his area, when some rare copy turned out, the kids would photocopy it, turn it into a book with some craft skills, and circulate it. The images shared show a photocopied version of Dragon Ball volume, with a cover hand-colored and some lettering made by pen on the inside.

It isn&#39;t unusual for kids to copy their favorite stories, comics, or art in order to share and appreciate their favorite characters more often than they would normally be able to. Given how limited copies were, this proves how resourceful Redondo&#39;s community of young comic readers&#39; was. In this case, it is also very interesting to see how well this particular &#34;homemade&#34; copy has held up. The spine appears rough, but the pages copied are still very crisp and clear, making it easy to read the Spanish text inside. There is no doubt that Redondo was truly a big fan of Dragon Ball growing up.






 Reduced Comic Accessibility Forced Kids To Crafty 
          

While copyright laws would dictate this wouldn&#39;t qualify as the best practice, it shows how much young readers in Redondo&#39;s community wanted access to the series. Today, things are much easier thanks to digitization and digital sales or subscriptions. Kids don&#39;t necessarily have to wait for a comic to be delivered physically to their location provided they have internet access and the money to purchase digital editions or manga subscriptions that are available in their geographical area. Comic accessibility has long been a major discussion among the industry and connectivity is continually improving with each passing year. Still, it&#39;s inspiring to see that Bruno Redondo went from photocopying and hand coloring Dragon Ball to becoming one of the most acclaimed comic book artists of today.
