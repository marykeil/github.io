SHY episode #4 will see the protagonist&#39;s true first challenge as she goes against fellow hero and Britain&#39;s representative, Stardust.





 What Time SHY Episode #4 Releases 
          




As with previous episodes, SHY streams exclusively on Crunchyroll, which can be accessed on their website and through their app. Episode #4 should premiere on Crunchyroll on Monday, October 23, at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (PST) and 12:00 PM Eastern (EST) in the United States and at 5:00 PM British Summer Time (BST) in the United Kingdom.

                  Crunchyroll&#39;s New Superhero Anime Fixes One Of My Hero Academia&#39;s Biggest Problems   SHY is a brand-new superhero anime airing on Crunchyroll, and it&#39;s already avoiding a big problem with its major contemporary, My Hero Academia.   



 What Happened In SHY Episode #3? 
          

SHY episode #3, “Conversation at the Dinner Table”, began with Teru and Iko hanging out at the mall and solidifying their friendship after the events of episode #2, but their hangout was soon interrupted by the arrival of Spirit. As per Unilord’s request, Spirit brought Teru to the space station so they could discuss the incident with Stigma, and since Iko was Stigma’s latest victim, she was to come to the space station, as well. Upon arriving there, Teru and Iko also met Britain’s hero Stardust, a major celebrity in the world whom Spirit paradoxically described as a psychopath.




                  What&#39;s New On Crunchyroll In Fall 2023   The Fall 2023 season of anime is about to start, and here are all the new anime people can expect to watch on Crunchyroll throughout the season.   

Once the meeting was underway, Stardust revealed that Stigma forced the same sort of monstrous transformation Iko underwent onto a friend of his, but rather than try to empathize with him as Shy did with Iko, Stardust solved the problem by cutting off his friend’s finger. Shy and Iko were startled by his ruthlessness, and to make matters worse, Unilord revealed that the other purpose of their gathering was to have Shy and Stardust fight as a test to see if Shy could handle the upcoming battle. Despite her obvious trepidation, Shy agreed to the fight, and she even agreed to quit being a hero if she couldn’t defeat Stardust.

 SHY Episode #4 Will Be Its Hero’s First True Test 
          

The biggest takeaway from the setup for SHY episode #4 is that it will be Shy’s first true test as both a hero and the protagonist. Naturally, Stardust will challenge Shy on a physical level, but he’s also been characterized as someone who foregoes mercy and compassion, something antithetical to Shy’s character, so the fight will also serve as a test of how well Shy can defend her ideologies. Something like that can do a great job of solidifying Shy’s character and the overall tone of the anime, so it will be great to see how SHY episode #4 decides to handle it.

Be sure to watch SHY episode #4 when it releases on Monday, October 23, on Crunchyroll.
