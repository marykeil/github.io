 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 3? 
          

Undead Unluck episode #3, “How to Use My Unluck”, continued where episode #2 left off with Fuko and Andy heading to Russia to kill another Negator to open up seats for the both of them on the roundtable. On the way there, they’re attacked by more Union agents, and thanks to Andy, Fuko discovers that her Unluck can be controlled insofar as she can control what happens depending on how much Unluck she’s built up. With that in mind, Fuko triggers an underwater volcano after Andy gives her CPR, and the two were able to use that to escape and make their way to Lake Baikal.




                  Shonen Jump&#39;s Most Underrated Manga Completely Reinvents Power Systems   Chapter 152 of Undead Unluck adds a whole other dynamic to an already innovative power system that leaves many others like it in the dust.   

After arriving at Lake Baikal, Andy goes to meet with his old war buddies so Fuko can go sightseeing, but her lack of life experience almost immediately leaves her feeling overwhelmed. While trying to avoid the tourists, Fuko met an energetic girl with whom she quickly struck a rapport, and the two bonded while painting the scenery of Lake Baikal and talking about change. Everything quickly took a turn for the dramatic, however, when the girl was revealed to be Gena, the Negator Shen sent them after who defeated Andy 50 years ago and was stated to be the worst Negator they could run into.



 Undead Unluck Sets Up A Bizarre World For Its Story 
          




Aside from the upcoming fight with Gena, the most noteworthy thing about Undead Unluck episode #3 is the bizarre world it’s setting up. Episode #3 had Fuko and Gena casually say that there’s nothing in space besides the moon and sun, meaning that the setting of Undead Unluck isn’t just the normal world but with supernatural beings, but one where the entire universe functions completely differently, and Fuko and Gena’s tone implies that this has always been how things are. Something like that adds a lot to Undead Unluck’s setting, and it will be great to see how the weirdness of its world is further explored going forward.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #4 when it releases on Friday, October 27.
