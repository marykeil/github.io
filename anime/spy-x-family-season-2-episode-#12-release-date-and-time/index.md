Spy x Family season 2, episode #11 follows Anya&#39;s friend Becky as she vows to finally steal Loid from Yor after being inspired by a steamy episode of her favorite TV show, Berlint in Love. Becky visits Anya intending to see Loid, who takes the opportunity to gather intel on Becky&#39;s family, which Becky mistakes for Loid taking an interest in her. Just then, Yor returns home and Becky pulls out her final card, pretending to be drunk from the tea served to her.

Unfortunately, Yor simple-mindedly believes her, and worrying that she may have accidentally served Becky alcohol, grabs her, and begins dashing to the nearest doctor. Becky admits to lying to get Loid&#39;s attention and learns that Loid likes Yor because of her strength. Failing to compete with Yor in that regard, Becky asks Yor to train her. Meanwhile, fans get to see a glimpse of Loid&#39;s fellow secret agent Nightfall, and her activities while Loid was on vacation. Nightfall takes on Loid&#39;s missions while he is away and vows to complete them to perfection to impress Loid while training hard to beat Yor. Loid gives Nightfall a souvenir from the trip which she giddily accepts.
