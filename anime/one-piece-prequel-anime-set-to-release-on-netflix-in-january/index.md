As per the official X account of Netflix Anime, Eichiro Oda&#39;s Monsters will be released in January 2024 exclusively on Netflix for international viewers, and Prime Video and Netflix for Japanese fans. The news comes with some exciting character designs and the reveal of some incredible names that will be working on the anime.

                  One Piece&#39;s Creator&#39;s First Manga Gets Anime Adaptation   While famous for creating One Piece, Eiichiro Oda wrote several short stories before One Piece, and one of his earliest works is receiving an anime.   


 The Tale Of The Greatest Swordsman Is Coming Soon 
         




This upcoming anime has fans very excited, not only because it will explore the legend of One Piece&#39;s strongest swordsman of the past, but also because of the people who will be bringing it to life. The director of Jujutsu Kaisen season 1 and animator on One Piece: Z, Park Sung Hoo, will be taking charge of the series with his new studio, E&amp;H Production. This will be the first anime his studio takes on, so Monsters will be his way of signaling to the anime industry that there is a new player to look out for. The character designer will be Takashi Kojima, the director of the celebrated episode #1015 of One Piece. From the art to the music, experienced veterans have been brought aboard to make this anime as good as One Piece.

          

The anime will explore the life of Shimotsuki Ryuma, the man known as the Sword God and the most legendary swordsman in One Piece&#39;s history. It was the first ever story by Eichiro Oda, who was 19 then. Titled Monsters: 103 Mercies Dragon Damnation, it will focus on Ryuma&#39;s most prominent achievement; his legendary slaying of a dragon. The tales of Ryuma will be set in the country of Wano, thus making the connection between Monsters and One Piece official.






103 Mercies Dragon Damnation is also Zoro&#39;s most powerful technique, the one he used to defeat King.




Ryuma&#39;s status in the world of One Piece is a bit complex. After a character named Ryuma appeared in the Thriller Bark arc - as a zombie reanimated by Gecko Moria - Eiichiro Oda confirmed that this was indeed the same Ryuma who appeared in Monsters. However, there are still some differences between the two, but the announcement that Monster takes place in Wano officially makes this story and its protagonist a part of One Piece&#39;s lore.

Of course, fans are well aware that Ryuma is also one of Zoro&#39;s ancestors, making the connection between Monsters and One Piece even more important. Coincidentally, One Piece&#39;s new Egghead Arc will begin airing in January 2024, giving fans of Oda&#39;s work even more reasons to be excited.

Monsters will be available to stream on Netflix in January 2024.
