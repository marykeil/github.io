## Literature Review

With Attack on Titan coming to a close, fans experienced some of the greatest openings in anime history, and this is where they rank.




Attack on Titan has established its presence among the greatest anime of all time in every aspect, and its openings are a pivotal reason. Anime series are notorious for leaving Easter eggs within their openings, all to hype fans up for the upcoming trials the main characters will encounter while utilizing catching, stylish, and captivating instrumentals and lyrics. However, no series has revealed the entirety of its plot through ethereal and breathtaking openings the way Attack on Titan has.
With the heavy stakes of humanity battling for survival against man-eating titans, it seems appropriate to amplify the situation&#39;s intensity with an ensemble of heavy orchestra instrumentals, chorus harmonization with a prominent aura to wage war until dawn, and visuals that leave fans intrigued and yearning for more. Attack on Titan&#39;s openings are nothing less than goosebumps-inducing masterpieces that tell a story beyond their visuals. None of the openings focus on what was happening that season, but rather the entirety of Attack on Titan&#39;s message, and this is their ranking based on how astonishing that message was conveyed.









 








 8  Season 4, Part 1: Shinsei Kamattechan - My War 
Opening 6


Attack on Titan kicks off the series&#39; final season with Boku no Senso (My War) by Shinsei Kamattechan. As the 6th opening in the series, there is no question that it repeats the similar high stakes and intensity of all the previous openings, and if its name was not enlightening enough, the visuals of opening 6 show a war of detrimental proportion.
As magnificent hues of saturation envelop the monochrome animation, the beauty of destruction brings My War to life. This song sounds more like a war cry than any regular opening, making it fit so well with the franchise. The opening&#39;s unique mash-up of female vocals, eerie piano, and hypnotic violin strings are as alluring as they are revealing. Scenes of a spine can be seen that foreshadow Eren Yager as the Founding Titan.





 7  Season 3, Part 1:YOSHIKI feat. HYDE - Red Swan 
Opening 3


Red Swan by YOSHIKI feat. HYDE is a sigh of relief compared to the other Attack on Titan openings. With its melodic tune and soothing vocals that move along with dazzling visuals that insinuate promise, intrigue, and sorrow, Attack on Titan Opening 3 is as sensational as it is rewarding. Scenes of Eren blissfully soaring through Shiganshina where he meets with Mikasa and Armin are followed by pastel images of the three friends together during much simpler times, followed by images of a young Levi Ackerman and his late uncle Kenny. Showing that this opening would have to do with the past and how it applies to the future.
With lyrics describing how it is okay to be afraid, it&#39;s okay to lie, because people are flawed like a fallen angel whose wings are drenched in blood and will make it to happiness if they stay on their path. This opening captures the beauty of youth, which is unfortunately tainted by circumstance.





 6  Season 1, Part 2: Linked Horizon - Jiyuu no Tsubasa Flugel der freiheit (The Wings of Freedom) 
Opening 2


The opening that unifies a military national anthem, angelic choir, and heavy metal into an ensemble of glorious proportions can only be found in Flugel der Freiheit (The Wings of Freedom) or Jiyuu no Tsubasa by Linked Horizon. Expectations were high following Attack on Titan&#39;s first opening, and Opening 2 did not disappoint. From start to finish, singer and songwriter Revo pours out his heart and soul with lyrics as freeing as they are relevant to the animations that focus on the protagonists joining the Scout Regiment and utilizing their ODM gear for the first time to fly across blue skies with their wings of freedom.
With the surfacing of intelligent titans, the stakes and lyrics of this opening reveal that the scouts will not waiver in the face of the enemy, and they will fight to ensure the deaths of their comrades are not in vain.





 5  Season 3, Part 2: Linked Horizon - Shoukei to Shikabane no Michi (Path of Aspirations and Corpses) 
Opening 5


Shoukei to Shikabane no Michi (Path of Aspirations and Corpses) by Linked Horizon is the epitome of the build-up to an insurmountable conclusion. A melody that highlights risk where the only reward is the ability to live to fight another day, Opening 5 harbors Scout Regiment&#39;s desperation to end the unyielding siege of pain and destruction brought by the titans. With lyrics that facilitate moving forward no matter what the heart feels, no matter how uncertain the future is, or how unforgiving the future could be.
These lyrics guide the animation of the Scouts plunging directly into Hell. Charging the enemy head first when they are outmatched in a way that is both reckless and inspirational. Hints at The Rumbling that is soon to come, only further emphasize the determination to end their war. The emotional toll of desperation is enough to bring a tear to the eye.





 4  Season 4, Part 3: SiM - Under The Tree 
Opening 8


The masterminds behind Attack on Titan&#39;s most menacing opening ended the series with yet another musical enchantment about righteous retribution and the pain of victory. Under The Tree by SiM is the culmination of every aspect of Attack on Titan. It brings together the visceral fear and internal conflict of the Scouts in their last attempt to save the world from Eren, who is hell-bent on destroying it, no matter the cost.
With many scenes being composed of yearning for or running to something that is far beyond reach, the end goal and lyrics of treading beyond the walls and seeking freedom become even more imminent. Opening 8 utilizes Attack on Titan&#39;s dark tone of intense electric instruments and vocals, backed by an impeccable choir, to create a visual collage of saturated images of past events that have led everything to this final moment.





 3  Season 1, Part 1: Linked Horizon - Guren no Yumiya (Feuerroter Pfeli und Bogen) 
Opening 1


The opening that set the tone for Attack on Titan showcased that it would be nothing less than a thrilling, heart-stopping, and breathtaking experience that would shake the world of anime forever. Opening 1 utilized chains to convey the fact that the citizens of Shiganshina are not living peacefully within the walls, they are trapped, wishing to be set free, like birds in a cage. Lead singer Revo pulled out all the stops with Guren no Yumiya (Fuerroter Pfeli und Bogen) by Linked Horizon, giving fans a song that reflects the trauma and turmoil the protagonists will endure.
The lyrics translate to, &#34;The humiliation of being caged is what triggers us to fight back. We hunters slaughter prey beyond the castle walls!&#34; The nostalgic chills from this opening are riveting. With animations of manga panels and future events, followed by the intense crescendo of the ensemble and the climax of the choir, Opening 1 will forever be known as the opening that perfectly started it all.





 2  Season 4, Part 2: SiM - The Rumbling 
Opening 7


A menacingly powerful and dominant force, The Rumbling by SiM is as captivating as it is terrifying. The end of the world is near, and what better way to pardon all who perished during the apocalypse than with this heavy metal anthem? The introduction to Opening 7 is an inevitably imposing tyrant that only begs the question of what happens when there&#39;s nothing left to give. Scenes from The 9 Titans flash showing their conviction and past, which lead to their connection to Ymir Fritz and The Paths.
Eren Yeager ominously walks atop Wall Maria where The Rumbling will commence, the Earth will quake, and 80 percent of the population will be decimated. The lyrics describe how Eren never wanted to be the king and how he never wanted to be a killer. Although he is remorseful, apologetic, and depressed, stillâ€¦ he still keeps moving forward against all that tried to take away his freedom. This opening mourningfully represents the fall of the hero and the rise of Eren as Attack on Titan&#39;s true villain.





 1  Season 2, Part 1: Linked Horizon - Shinzou Wa Sasageyo 
Opening 3


The peak of Attack on Titan was not the beginning or the end, it was during the second season and became apparent the moment the eternal flames of Shinzou wa Sasageyo by Linked Horizon burst into life. The pleasant key playing of the piano to the maniacal orchestra tearing through the screen showcasing the title intro. Attack on Titan Opening 3 from the start proved to have promise, given to fans by repeat offenders of alluring greatness, Linked Horizon. It&#39;s no wonder that this opening treads far beyond perfection.
The animation shows the titans that have terrorized Shiganshina returning without end, the scouts preparing for battle, and lyrics that translate to &#34;What must we do to surpass the strength of devils? We&#39;ve no desire to protect our lives or our souls. Offer up! Offer up! Offer up your hearts!&#34; This, by any means necessary, opening climaxes with the Scouts charging into battle, and Eren transforming to battle the Armored Titan. Opening 3 is exciting, catchy, stylish, and cinematic, making it Attack on Titan&#39;s best opening of all time.
