## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1091 will reveal more about the woman claiming to be Vegapunk and show more of the futuristic Egghead Island as well.




Episode #1091 of One Piece will finally let fans get acquainted with a character who was first teased hundreds of episodes ago. The Egghead Island arc has started off on a very strong note with exciting action and important lore reveals. If episode #1091 can maintain this level of quality then it will be one that fans won’t want to miss.

 What Happened in Episode #1090 of One Piece? 
          

Episode #1090 picked up where the previous episode left off as the Straw Hats had to escape from the jaws of a giant mechanical shark. In the chaos of the fight, Luffy, Chopper, and Jinbe were separated from the rest of the crew as they attempted to save a young child who turned out to be Jewelry Bonney, another member of the Worst Generation. Luckily, Jinbe was able to get this group to safety, finding shelter on the nearby Egghead Island, which is the home of the famous scientist Dr. Vegapunk. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew was saved by a woman in a giant robot who claimed to be this mysterious doctor.






The episode also featured Helmeppo trying to rally help to rescue Koby from Blackbeard.






 One Piece Episode #1091 Will Show More of Vegapunk and Egghead 
          

Given how important and mysterious Vegapunk is, with their official introduction at the end of the last installment, episode #1091 will surely delve more into their character. The woman claiming to be Dr. Vegapunk is a bit suspicious since the scientist had previously been described as an old man. However, with the advanced level of technology on display so far in this arc, there likely is a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy. In addition, Luffy’s group will be able to explore more of Egghead Island for themselves and perhaps find out why Bonney wants to track him down. Bonney hasn’t been featured much yet so learning more about her will be nice.




While the arc is only just beginning, the Vegapunk reveal at the end of episode #1090 promises that it will be an arc filled with important lore reveals and world-building. These are the qualities of some of One Piece’s best arcs, so hopefully Egghead Island will fall into that category as well. In order to see how the Egghead Island arc shapes up for themselves, fans will need to catch One Piece episode #1091 when it airs on Crunchyroll on January 20.
