# One-Punch Man Confirms Saitama s Greatest Pupil, &amp; It Isn t Genos


## SUMMARY 



  Sonic&#39;s repeated attacks on Saitama have paid off, as he displays his improved abilities in Chapter #197 of One-Punch Man.   Sonic compares his opponents to Saitama and realizes they can&#39;t even compare, motivating him to aim to surpass Saitama in strength.   While Genos&#39; growth depends on his cyborg upgrades, Sonic has only improved through his attacks on Saitama, proving he is actually a better &#34;disciple&#34;.

## Literature Review

One villain&#39;s repeated attempts to challenge Saitama have led to him becoming phenomenally stronger as a result, and Saitama may not even know it.




Warning: Spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter #197 (JP)/#195(EN)One-Punch Man chapter #197 puts recurring villain Speed-o&#39;-Sound Sonic in the spotlight, but it turns out that Sonic has improved a lot throughout the series, and surprisingly, it&#39;s all thanks to Saitama. In fact, based on his growth on display in this chapter, it&#39;s fair to say that Sonic has been a more successful student to Saitama than even Genos.




Chapter #197 sees Sonic meeting Flashy Flash at a designated spot for what was intended to be a battle to the death. The two haven&#39;t really seen each other since they were children at the Ninja Village together, and thus Flashy Flash has no idea of Sonic&#39;s abilities in the present. As it turns out, neither do fans, as Sonic&#39;s abilities are actually a match for Flashy Flash, who is a top-tier, S-Class hero.

          

Flashy Flash is impressed, and wonders if together their strength might be enough to defeat the Ninja Village&#39;s leader. At that moment, however, a large group of ninja from the village appear, intending to kill Flashy Flash themselves.



The English version of One-Punch Man, published by Viz, has a different numbering due to the authors adding or re-doing chapters in the original Japanese version.








 Sonic&#39;s Desire to Defeat Saitama Has Driven Him to Greater Heights 
          

When faced with the mob of highly-trained, elite ninja, Sonic stands up to them, claiming his duel with Flashy Flash supersedes theirs and threatens to fight them as well. They&#39;re shocked at his audacity, but then it&#39;s revealed that Sonic is comparing their strength with Saitama&#39;s, and it doesn&#39;t even begin to measure up. Saitama has set a new bar for what true strength is to Sonic, a bar that he intends to aim for and surpass. Flashy Flash notes that Sonic must have done a lot of training, and it&#39;s clear in the context that this was training to take down Saitama.

Even Sonic&#39;s most casual defeats at Saitama&#39;s hands seem to have led to him learning about his deficiencies and training to overcome them. Since Saitama won&#39;t kill Sonic, he can try again and again, improving in some way each time while discovering new weaknesses that he needs to patch. In a way, Saitama is behaving almost like an old master, with Sonic as his pupil, even though he doesn&#39;t realize it. Sonic has grown up in the harsh Ninja Village and is particularly used to this kind of training. If Sonic&#39;s abilities are now on par with an S-Class hero, then he&#39;s already improved substantially from his first appearances.






 Genos Has Not Gained Much Power From Being Around Saitama 
          

Compared to Sonic&#39;s progress, Saitama&#39;s self-appointed disciple, Genos, seems to be lagging. Recently, Genos even had a sad realization about Saitama, concluding that their relationship was one-sided. In fact, Genos&#39; progress in terms of power depends on his cyborg upgrades, so there is not much he can learn from Saitama. While both have actually benefitted from each other&#39;s presence in emotional terms, from a strength perspective it was Sonic who gained most from Saitama. Given Sonic&#39;s progress, he can definitely claim that he, and not Genos, is Saitama&#39;s most successful &#34;disciple&#34; in One-Punch Man.
