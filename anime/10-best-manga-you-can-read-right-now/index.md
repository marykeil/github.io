## Literature Review

Given manga&#39;s variety, it may be difficult to decide which titles are actually worthwhile, but no one can go wrong when choosing one of these.




Objectively naming the best manga is no easy task, as the medium&#39;s incredible variety and diversity make it difficult to compare and contrast works across genres, themes, and time periods. Regardless, some titles stand clearly above others in terms of popularity and reception, having made a name for themselves as some of the best experiences that readers could possibly have.
Unfortunately, not every manga is easily accessible to readers worldwide, with many of the best manga still not having official English translations, but that is not the case for the entries on this list, all of which are generally easy to find and start reading, whether digitally or in print. Their genres, themes, and target audiences vary greatly, but all of them are equally worthy of praise for being able to stand out in such a crowded industry.









 








 10  Vinland Saga 
The Best Historical Fiction Manga
        

  Release Year   2005    Publisher   Kodansha    Where to Read Online   K Manga    Creator   Makoto Yukimura    
While historical titles may be common in the medium, very few choose to portray the complicated life of Vikings, which allows Vinland Saga to stand out from its very premise. However, it certainly has a lot more aspects worthy of recommendation beyond the unique theme, such as the complex characters, intricate yet brutal story, and incredibly detailed art style. The events revolve around Thorfinn, whose life is redefined by the death of his father, a great Viking warrior. Joining the mercenary crew of the ones who killed his family, he initially seeks nothing but power and revenge, though his motivations and goals change as he grows up into one of the best pacifist characters in the medium.





 9  One Piece 
The Undisputed King Of Shonen Manga


 







  Release Year   1997    Publisher   Viz Media    Where to Read Online   Viz, Manga Plus    Creator   Eiichiro Oda    
One Piece is the first of Shounen Jump&#39;s Big Three, as well as the series that gave birth to various ideas that would become common tropes in the genre. Following the journey of Monkey D. Luffy and his eclectic crew of pirates as they search for the titular legendary treasure, One Piece tells an epic saga defined by unique and unforgettable adventures, as well as iconic and complex characters with intricate backstories and developments. While there are various ways to enjoy this story, including a live-action adaptation whose continuation has been confirmed, the original is hard to beat.





 8  Land Of The Lustrous 
A Triumph In Fantasy Action
        

  Release Year   2012    Publisher   Kodansha    Where to Read Online   K Manga    Creator   Haruko Ichikawa    
Land of the Lustrous is a truly peerless title, telling a unique story set in a world unlike any other. The central characters are anthropomorphized gems known as the Lustruous, who, under the guidance of the mysterious yet powerful Kongou-sensei, have to defend themselves from the countless assaults of the Lunarians, a species of moon inhabitants who seek to use their crystalline bodies as weapons and decorations. Though it may initially appear to be an innocent story relying on the creativity of its premise, it slowly but surely reveals itself to be much darker and more impactful than any reader could possibly expect.





 7  Kaguya-sama: Love Is War 
The Manga That Redefines Romcoms
        

  Release Year   2015    Publisher   Viz Media    Where to Read Online   Viz    Creator   Aka Akasaka    
While Kaguya-sama: Love Is War is well-known in the anime world, with the title&#39;s anime adaptation being immensely popular and spanning multiple seasons, the original manga is still extremely enjoyable even without the catchy soundtrack. The narrative follows the titular Kaguya, as well as Miyuki, two top students at an elite high school who, despite being in love with each other, are too proud to admit it, instead attempting to convince the other to confess first. Moreover, thanks to a well-paced story written by Aka Akasaka, who later wrote Oshi No Ko, this is one experience that no reader will regret giving a chance.





 6  Real 
Takehiko Inoue&#39;s Darker Take On Basketball Manga
        

  Release Year   1999    Publisher   Viz Media    Where to Read Online   Unavailable    Creator   Takehiko Inoue    
Created by Takehiko Inoue, the genius behind famous titles such as Slam Dunk and Vagabond, Takehiko Inoue&#39;s Real is a title that, while it may not have received as much attention or critical acclaim as its older siblings, should not be overlooked either. The story follows three main characters, all of whom are struggling with their own personal issues. One of them is a former star athlete who ended up disabled due to a disease, and another one also has his life redefined after becoming paralyzed due to a traffic accident. Considered by some to be the author&#39;s best and most mature work, this story is profound and genuinely impactful.





 5  Yotsuba&amp;! 
The Peak Of Slice-Of-Life Manga
        

  Release Year   2003    Publisher   Yen Press    Where to Read Online   Unavailable    Creator   Kiyohiko Azuma    
As a slow-paced work with a gentle atmosphere typical of iyashikei titles, Yotsuba&amp;! may not have a particularly intricate setting or story, but that hasn&#39;t stopped it from being one of the medium&#39;s best comedy titles. Revolving around the titular Yotsuba Koiwai, this manga is an honest and nostalgic exploration of the curious minds of innocent children who see every unknown as a new opportunity to have fun. Given that Yotsuba has recently moved to a new place, her world is full of new things to discover, taking readers along on her journey and reminding them of simpler times, that many may have forgotten due to their fast-paced environments.





 4  20th Century Boys 
Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Incredible Sci-Fi Hit
        

  Release Year   1999    Publisher   Viz Media    Where to Read Online   Unavailable    Creator   Naoki Urasawa    
Created by Naoki Urasawa, an author whose mastery over the drama/mystery genre was proven through Monster, Naoki Urasawa&#39;s 20th Century Boys is another attempt at exploring this combination of genres, this time with a sci-fi twist. The story follows Kenji Endo who, following the sudden suicide of one of his childhood friends, seeks to reunite with more of his old friends, discovering a mysterious cult in the process and getting caught up in more than he bargained for. While the grandiose theme of saving the world is a staple of the medium, this take on the idea is certainly one of the best and most memorable ones.





 3  Vagabond 
Takehiko Inoue&#39;s Greatest Manga


 







  Release Year   1998    Publisher   Viz Media    Where to Read Online   Unavailable    Creator   Takehiko Inoue    
Vagabond is an award-winning title that is often counted among the best manga without an anime adaptation. Inspired by the real life of the renowned &#34;Sword Saint&#34; Miyamoto Musashi, Vagabond aims to retell his story from a new angle. The events revolve around the man who, before being reborn as the legendary samurai, was but an aggressive, ordinary man, named Shinmen Takezou, who enlisted in the army in search of glory and fame, only to return to his village and become a wanted criminal after losing the battle. Thanks to strong willpower and a couple of unlikely friends, he turned his fate around, becoming the icon he is today.





 2  Goodnight Punpun 
The Darkest Coming-Of-Age Story In Manga
        

  Release Year   2007    Publisher   Viz Media    Where to Read Online   Viz    Creator   Inio Asano    
While coming-of-age stories may not be uncommon, there is nothing quite like Goodnight Punpun, which takes the classic formula and innovates upon it by boldly incorporating elements that others would shy away from, telling a grim, yet realistic story. Punpun is but a normal boy experiencing the various trials of growing up, including but not limited to his perspective of his parents, love, and himself, trials which are displayed and explored in an honest and powerful manner. Known for its depiction of human relationships and the complexities of life, often visualized in surreal ways, this is one of the most original and memorable titles in the medium.





 1  Berserk 
The Greatest Manga of All Time


 







  Release Year   1989    Publisher   Dark Horse    Where to Read Online   Unavailable    Creator   Kentaro Miura    
Originally created by Kentaro Miura and then taken over by his childhood friend, Kouji Mori, following the author&#39;s death, Berserk is an award-winning title that garnered a lot of attention with its dark themes and shocking twists. The story revolves around protagonist Guts, a former mercenary known as the &#34;Black Swordsman&#34; now marked for death, who struggles to live and protect what he cares for in spite of his cruel and merciless fate. Between the gorgeous artwork and the moving plot, there&#39;s no doubt that Berserk is the greatest manga ever made.
Though it has received multiple anime adaptations as well, they vary significantly in terms of quality, and anime-only watchers have missed plenty of memorable Berserk scenes that are yet to be adapted. 

From slow-paced, relaxing, and grounded stories, to intricate, dark, and fantastical ones, the manga medium is complex and wide enough to cater to any reader&#39;s needs, as long as one is willing to explore their options. Unfortunately, the sheer variety of options may make it difficult to decide on which specific journey to embark on, as reading manga can prove to be quite a commitment in terms of time and money. Regardless of what one is looking for, these are some of the best manga to read, providing drastically different unforgettable, and unique experiences.
