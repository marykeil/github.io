## Literature Review

Crunchyroll confirms the second season of Tower Of God, exciting fans of the famous manhwa who have been waiting for more of the anime.




Tower of God, the highly acclaimed anime series, has officially been greenlit for a second season, expected to hit the screens in 2024. The first season, which debuted in April 2020, received widespread appreciation from fans and critics alike. Despite having only 13 episodes, it was able to captivate the audience, leaving them hungry for more.




This year&#39;s Anime NYC is expected to have many anime announcements, and Tower Of God was one of the more surprising ones. Based on the digital comic Tower of God published by WEBTOON, the anime series proved to be a big hit when it was released in 2020. It has been 3 years since the anime&#39;s first season ended, and barely any news was shared regarding the second season. Fans of the anime and WEBTOON are ecstatic knowing that Tower Of God season 2 will be released in July 2024.


 

Crunchyroll, a popular streaming service for anime and manga, unveiled the teaser and key visual for their upcoming project during the Anime NYC event. This annual event serves as a platform for major announcements and updates in the anime and manga industry.

                  10 Best Manhwa on Webtoon   Webtoon has a little of something for everyone with well over a million titles to choose from. Here are 10 of the best manhwa on the platform.   





 Tower Of God Makes Its Return In Summer 2024 

 

The teaser doesn&#39;t contain anything from the anime but is instead a manhwa teaser. According to the teaser, the anime will adapt the Return Of The Prince arc and Workshop Battle Arc. This suggests that Tower of God season 2 will be split into 2 cours. A new character, Ja Wangnan, will be introduced in the first part, which is set 6 years after Bam is betrayed by Rachel and is thrown to the bottom of the Wine Glass, and presumed dead.

The Tower of God anime is an adaptation of the highly popular WEBTOON with the same name, which was created by the talented SIU. The WEBTOON has been running since 2010 and is still ongoing. Despite its huge popularity, the author often takes extended breaks, with one break lasting almost a year. The story follows Bam, a boy who has lived in a cave his whole life but ventures into a massive tower after the only person he has known, Rachel, leaves him to go there. The tower promises to grant anyone who reaches the top any wish, and only people who are known as Regulars are allowed into it. However, despite Bam not being destined to enter the tower, he still enters, making him a type of anomaly known as an Irregular.




Tower of God set a great precedent for Korean manhwa being adapted into anime, with anime like Solo Leveling following suit. WEBTOONs have always been popular among anime and manga fans, so it&#39;s great to see their exposure increasing through anime adaptations. Although summer 2024 doesn&#39;t have many anticipated anime yet, Tower of God season 2 is definitely a promising addition to anime&#39;s Summer 2024 lineup.

Look for Tower of God season 2 when it releases in July 2024 and read the digital comic now on WEBTOON.
