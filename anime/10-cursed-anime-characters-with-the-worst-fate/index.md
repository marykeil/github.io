## Literature Review

Whether they are doomed to certain death or simply forced to live in unenviable conditions, these characters truly get the short end of the stick.




Cursed anime characters tend to suffer terrible fates, which in turn means that they need to learn to be stronger and more resilient to survive. This is why those who grapple with the effects of various curses also tend to be the ones to stand out thanks to their impressive adaptability.
Curses can affect their victims in a plethora of ways, including transforming the cursed ones, condemning them to certain death, or, on the contrary, to immortality, which is rarely as pleasant as it seems. Some learn to accept their fates, while others struggle to overcome them, but no one who ends up in such a situation is enviable in any way.

As one-half of Undead Unluck’s pair of protagonists, Fuuko Izumo possesses the titular Unluck ability. Much like other Negators, who are able to negate certain worldly rules, the awakening of her ability also causes a series of tragedies in her life. By negating the luck of those who touch her, Fuuko unwittingly causes the deaths of her beloved parents and other relatives, which consequently results in her depression. Although she is a determined and kind person, her cursed luck restricts her from getting close to anyone, as she always concerns herself with the well-being of others, living a lonely and isolated life.

However, the one who suffers from a worse curse, though not as dreadful as those of other titles, is Ryoga Hibiki, Ranma’s rival.

In the world of The Ancient Magus&#39; Bride, a fantastic cottagecore anime title, the term Sleigh Beggy refers to humans who are born with the ability to generate and attract magical energy, in exchange for a shorter lifespan. Often, their affinity for the supernatural draws them towards sorcerers and faes, resulting in their misfortune and untimely ends. In addition to her condition as a Sleigh Beggy, Chise Hatori also ends up a victim of the Dragon’s Curse, which transforms her arm and guarantees her death within one year. However, she later ends up being granted the Curse of Immortality, which leaves her remaining lifespan uncertain, though even immortality is rarely as appealing as it sounds.

It’s no secret just how mysterious this place is, but the extent of its darkness is what eventually proves genuinely shocking about it. The Curse of the Abyss affects everyone ascending within it, and the worst one is that of the sixth layer, which causes loss of humanity or even certain death, almost as if to trap everyone who makes it to that level.

Once Hyakkimaru realizes that there is a way to regain what he lost, he sets out to slay all the demons who stole from him.
