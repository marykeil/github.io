The series is more than just an action anime. Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most interesting characters are sure to make fans fall in love, which might be unfortunate for some as the series also boasts an impressive count of dead characters. The series is hilarious when there&#39;s nobody dying, and there are small hints of romance too. If there is a show action anime fans should definitely watch, it is for sure Jujutsu Kaisen.
After watching a heart-throbbing romance or complex series, fans just want an anime that is all about the action. The best action anime provide a great refresher for when fans are in the mood to see quality and intense fights. Although it&#39;s easy to replace many of these with hits like Fire Force or Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, these series have earned their spots as the best action anime of all time.
