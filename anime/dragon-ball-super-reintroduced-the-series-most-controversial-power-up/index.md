## Literature Review

The Saiyans&#39; signature ability to come back stronger from defeat has always been a controversial one, but its return in Super came with some caveats.


Summary

  The Saiyan trademark ability known as &#34;zenkai boost&#34; (aka Saiyan Power) allows them to come back stronger after near-death experiences.   The ability became controversial in Dragon Ball Z as it made battles predictable and stale, giving the heroes a power boost whenever they were in trouble.   Despite Toriyama&#39;s claims that the ability was written out due to its problematic impact on the story, zenkai boosts returned in Dragon Ball Super, but now they have clear limits.  





Every Dragon Ball fan is familiar with the idea of the Saiyan Power, sometimes referred to by fans as &#34;zenkai boosts&#34; which allows a Saiyan to come back from the brink of death stronger than ever. While the ability played a big role in Dragon Ball Z, its use waned over time and it was completely discontinued by the end of the series. However, Dragon Ball Super reintroduced it, but it is now more subtle.




Saiyan Power has played a role in a huge number of the series&#39; most memorable battles, and is far more potent when combined with Senzu Beans, which can heal someone instantly back to a healthy state. The ability became controversial because any time Goku or another Saiyan hero was on the ropes, the Saiyan Power would kick in and give them a power boost, which ultimately had the effect of making battles predictable and even a bit stale.

          

Just like Vegeta does on Namek, having Krillin almost kill him to then get healed by Dende, all the Saiyan characters in the story could have abused this power to get stronger easily and repeatedly. In the Dragon Ball databook Daizenshuu 7, Toriyama himself implied that the ability was effectively written out of the story by making the power boosts it provided so small as to be negligible.





 Saiyan Power Boosts Make A Comeback In Dragon Ball Super 
          

Despite this statement, though, the Saiyan Power boosts came back in Dragon Ball Super and they continue to play a role in the story - just not to help Goku or Vegeta. In chapter #20 of Dragon Ball Super, during the Future Trunks arc, Goku Black employs the Saiyan Power ability in combination with his god Ki to achieve untold levels of power, which is how he unlocks Super Saiyan Rosé in the first place. He was able to do this by abusing Zamasu&#39;s healing ability, and by fighting at a low enough power level that incoming attacks could trigger the boost. Giving the enemy this ability that has been so essential to Goku was a rather brilliant twist, and it definitely ramped up the tension of the battle.

This isn&#39;t the only instance of the ability appearing in Super, however. During a flashback seen in the Granolah the Survivor Saga, Goku&#39;s father Bardock is seen making use of the Saiyan Power. In chapter #83, Bardock gains a mysterious power boost while battling with Gas. The aura visible around him and the circumstances make it likely that this was a Saiyan Power boost. This power boost was enough to allow Bardock to overcome Gas&#39;s unleashed state without Super Saiyan, suggesting it made him substantially more powerful. Bardock is victorious, but without special healing, he is left quite beaten afterward.






 Dragon Ball Super Fixed The Problematic &#34;Saiyan Power&#34; Boosts 
          

It&#39;s clear that the &#34;zenkai&#34; Saiyan Power is still a factor within Dragon Ball Super, despite Toriyama&#39;s claims. This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, so long as the ability continues to be kept under check. In chapter #20 of Super, in fact, Trunks says that Goku and Vegeta can no longer abuse that ability because they’ve already hit their limit. After all, this is a native power to the Saiyans, and it only makes sense that it would still be on display by other Saiyans even if the heroes have used it to its full potential. Finding a way to continue having the ability show up without using it to trivialize what should be major fights seems like the best possible outcome. It will be interesting to see how the Saiyan Power, or zenkai boost, continues to be used in Dragon Ball Super as the story moves forward.
