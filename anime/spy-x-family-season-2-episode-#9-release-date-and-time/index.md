 What Happened In Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #8? 
          

Spy x Family season 2, episode #8 takes off with Yor and her clients attempting to reach the cargo room in order to get a hold of an emergency ship. Unfortunately, Yor senses assassins blocking the path and decides to use the service corridors to make it to the deck. One of the assassins who&#39;d earlier picked up their scents manages to pinpoint them, and the battle royale begins as soon as Yor and her clients make it to where the firework show has begun.




Yor quickly finds herself surrounded by assassins, but fortunately, the Director swoops in to take out a sniper, pointing out a hatch nearby as he does so. With the clients safely hidden in the hatch, Yor begins taking on the countless assassins along with the Director in a bloody battle. Elsewhere, Anya enjoys the fireworks with Loid and the other passengers aboard the ship, hinting at the developing bond between the Forger family.

          

Only three assassins remain, who Yor quickly finds are much stronger than the ones she&#39;s faced so far. The swordsman quickly corners Yor as she feels the exhaustion of the battle catching up to her. Wanting to continue protecting Yuri, Loid, and Anya, Yor overpowers the swordsman, snapping his blade with her bare hand and making for one of Yor&#39;s most badass moments in the series thus far.




Meanwhile, Yuri collapses from the exhaustion of a cold while chasing a suspect. While resting, he thinks back to how Yor took care of him when he was sick when they were younger, going as far as to fight boars while gathering ingredients to make him herbal tea. Despite the tea tasting weird, Yuri finds himself still craving Yor&#39;s tea even as an adult.



 Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #9 Will Likely Conclude Yor&#39;s Ship Battle 
          

Season 2 episode #9 of Spy x Family is titled &#34;The Hand That Connects to the Future&#34; and will likely conclude Yor&#39;s fight against the remaining assassins, including the swordsman. That said, Yor&#39;s clients and the ship as a whole may not be out of danger just yet as the informant is yet to be apprehended and seems to still have more tricks up his sleeve.

The preview hints that Yor and her allies at Garden may have to deal with a hidden bomb aboard the ship. Lucky for them, Anya&#39;s psychic powers would be perfect in such a situation, so perhaps fans will get to see Anya discreetly lend Yor a helping hand as well. Nonetheless, the upcoming episode of Spy x Family is sure to be just as exciting and hilarious as previous outings.




Don&#39;t miss Spy x Family season 2 episode #9 when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 2, 2023.
