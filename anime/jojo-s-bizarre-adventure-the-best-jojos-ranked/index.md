## Literature Review

Over the decades, JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure has featured many unique heroes in both the anime and manga, but who are the fan favorites?




All the protagonists of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure are beloved by fans for a variety of reasons, as they face enemies and challenges across the generations. Mangaka Hirohiko Araki’s tastes in style and character have varied wildly since he first started to write and draw JoJo in the 1980s, resulting in an eclectic collection of heroes, from the honorable gentleman Jonathan to the hot-blooded delinquent Jolyne. However, some versions stand out to fans more than others.
With all the JoJos being so different though, no one thing defines what makes a good Joestar. While Jonathan&#39;s nobility makes him admirable, Jodio&#39;s dedication to committing crime gives him a solid character arc. Ultimately, the only ways to rank all of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventures&#39; JoJos is by how likable they are, how compelling their development is, and their impact on the series at large.









 








 9  Jonathan Joestar is a Shining Hero 
Debut Series: Phantom Blood
        

While Jonathan isn’t technically the first of the Joestar line, he is the first of the family to be more than a wealthy gentleman, as he ascends to the level of a noble hero. The good half of one of anime’s best sibling rivalries, he fights with everything he’s got to become strong and defeat his evil adoptive brother, Dio Brando. Many fans find Jonathan bland because his pure goodness isn’t as complex or interesting as most of the other JoJos&#39; personalities. However, he maintains a small but dedicated fan base simply because his kindness and nobility, especially through the short and tragic life he leads, are so pleasant to watch.





 8  Josuke Higashikata is a Pragmatic Warrior 
Debut Series: Jojolion
        

While technically a counterpart of Part 4&#39;s Josuke, Jojolion&#39;s Josuke is really an entirely separate character. Affectionately referred to by fans as &#34;Gappy&#34; for the gap in his front teeth, Josuke is an amnesiac found by Yasuho and taken in by the Higashikata family. Unlike Diamond Is Unbreakable’s Josuke, who is willing to be friends with just about anyone, JoJolion’s Josuke is in constant conflict with other characters, who are after him for reasons he can’t understand until he figures out his own identity. Josuke is ruthless and brutally logical, having no qualms about killing his opponents in cold blood.





 7  Jodio Joestar is a Criminal Jojo 
Debut Series: The JoJoLands
        

The still-fresh protagonist of part 9, The JoJoLands, Jodio is the latest Joestar, and the third to appear in the alternate timeline of parts 7 and 8. Jodio is very different from most other JoJos, as Jodio&#39;s introduced as an absolute delinquent and drug dealer who readily agrees to a burglary in the first few chapters. That&#39;s not to say Jodio is without redeeming qualities; he loves and protects his sibling Dragona Joestar, and while he longs for riches, he mostly seems to want to help his mother. Jodio&#39;s Stand ability, November Rain, is one of the most unique yet, with a non-humanoid form and the ability to rain down drops of liquid that can hit with incredible force, if desired.





 6  Giorno Giovanna Crusades Against Crime 
Debut Series: Golden Wind
        

Giorno may be one of the least popular JoJos due to his calm and reserved personality, but like Jotaro, just because he’s quiet doesn’t mean there’s nothing interesting about him. Being the product of both the Brando and Joestar bloodlines, Giorno possesses the most notable qualities of both. Having survived a childhood full of abuse and neglect and latching onto the Italian mafia as a source of power, Giorno is devoted to his dream of taking over the organization and using that power to eliminate the drug trade and child abuse in the country. Wielding one of the scariest Stands in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure for good, Giorno pursues justice, but is utterly ruthless in doing so.





 5  Jolyne Cujoh Fights for Her Friends 
Debut Series: Stone Ocean


 







Jolyne is the first and (to date) only female JoJo in the series. Though she has a past as a delinquent stemming from her resentment towards her father Jotaro for never being around, she has been sheltered from their family’s enemies and is shocked to be thrown into the fight against Dio&#39;s follower Pucci. She relies on her sheer determination to overcome everything he throws at her. Through her experiences in Green Dolphin Street Prison, Jolyne not only realizes that her father does deeply care about her, but grows stronger, gains loyal friends, and starts fighting to protect the world. Despite being hot-blooded, sharp-tongued, and proud, Jolyne avoids killing whenever she can, and in combat, she makes extremely clever use of her string-based Stand ability, Stone Ocean.





 4  Johnny Joestar Has the Best Character Growth 
Debut Series: Steel Ball Run
        

Johnny is the hero of Steel Ball Run, the seventh part of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, which is set in a brand-new timeline. Paralyzed in a horseback riding accident, he teams up with Gyro Zeppeli to complete the titular marathon and try to find a way to heal his legs, but the two quickly find that they’ve been drawn into a nationwide conspiracy. By his own admission, Steel Ball Run is Johnny’s journey from being a selfish, bitter teenager to a confident and compassionate adult who can finally connect with other people. This steady development makes him a favorite among manga fans, who prefer him over some of the more static protagonists of the rest of the series.





 3  Josuke Higashikata is a Brash and Mischievous Hero 
Debut Series: Diamond is Unbreakable


 







Appearing only in Diamond is Unbreakable, Josuke nevertheless made a huge impression on fans. The illegitimate son of Joseph, Josuke inherited his father’s penchant for dramatics and his whole family’s intense desire to do good. The healing abilities of his Stand, Crazy Diamond, are incredibly powerful and pair well with its incredible speed and destructive power. Josuke is upbeat and friendly wherever he goes, and is very quick to turn strangers and even enemies into friends. He does, however, have a powerful well of rage to tap into when his very few buttons are pressed: anyone who hurts the innocent or insults his carefully groomed hair will meet a terrible fate.





 2  Jotaro Kujo is a Protective Son and Father 
Debut Series: Stardust Crusaders
        

Like his grandfather Joseph, Jotaro is one of the strongest characters in anime, whose long career of heroism spans multiple parts of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure. First introduced in part 3, Stardust Crusaders, he journeys across the globe with his companions to save his mother and the world from DIO. Jotaro then teams up with Josuke to rid Morioh of a serial killer in part 4, and finally steps in to protect his daughter Jolyne from DIO’s surviving followers in part 6. While he can come across as callous and rude, as Jotaro matures, it becomes clearer and clearer that he has the same noble Joestar heart as the rest of his family. Though he doesn’t often show his emotions openly (unlike his Stand, Star Platinum, which is very expressive) Jotaro always uses his great strength for good, and would never hurt the innocent.





 1  Joseph Joestar is a Lovable Rogue 
Debut Series: Battle Tendency


 







Joseph is the other JoJo who appears most often throughout the series, showing up in parts 2, 3, and 4. Joseph is the polar opposite of his grandfather Jonathan, being brash, crude and disrespectful, and utterly lacking in shame for anything he does. Despite his personality, Joseph is a genius fighter, which is why he’s enjoyed such a long and successful life. He can analyze an opponent’s strategy and anticipate their next moves at lightning speed, and though he’ll show respect to worthy opponents like the Pillar Men, he still takes great joy in outwitting them and defeating them with underhanded tactics. His inextinguishable confidence endears him to tens of thousands of fans.
No matter the series, era, or universe, JoJo fans can be sure that there are some wild adventures to be had with each of them. The Joestar family line is overflowing with heroic figures, and while some may be more popular than others, they all still hold a place close to every JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure fan&#39;s heart.
