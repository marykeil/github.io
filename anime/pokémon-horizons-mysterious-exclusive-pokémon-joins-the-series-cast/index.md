# Pokémon Horizons  Mysterious Exclusive Pokémon Joins The Series  Cast


## SUMMARY 



  Liko&#39;s pendant, which is actually a mysterious Pokémon, has become a central focus of the plot in Pokémon Horizons. It has protected Liko and even projected images that had a calming effect on powerful Pokémon like Titan Arboliva and Galarian Moltres.   Unlike previous instances, the pendant did not transform back into a pendant after its encounter with Galarian Moltres. This raises concerns as the crew tries to hide the large Pokémon from others, potentially making it harder to protect.   The next episode may provide new information about the Pokémon and its connection to something called &#34;Rakua.&#34; Fans speculate that this Pokémon could be a form of Terapagos, a Legendary Pokémon in the series. Regardless, this Pokémon&#39;s presence poses challenges and opportunities for the heroes in their journey.

## Literature Review

The mysterious, crystalline turtle Pokémon that has only appeared in the anime thus far seems to be set for a more permanent presence on the show.




Warning: Spoilers for Pokémon Horizons, episode #23Fans of Pokémon Horizons are already well aware that Liko&#39;s pendant isn&#39;t some ordinary piece of jewelry, but is in fact a never-before-seen Pokémon, but it seems this mystery Pokémon is set to take on a bigger role, joining the cast aboard the airship as a Pokémon.




Liko&#39;s pendant is a major focus of Pokémon Horizons&#39; plot; it&#39;s what the bad guys are after, and their attempt to steal it is what set Liko on course for adventure in the first place. In the second episode, the pendant transformed into a mysterious Pokémon, putting up a barrier which protected Liko from an incoming attack. Later, when up against the Titan Arboliva, the pendant transformed in front of the crew, and projected an image of the Ancient Adventurer, Lucius, which seemingly calmed Arboliva and brought it around, ultimately entrusting itself to Liko&#39;s care. Now, up against another of the Ancient Adventurer&#39;s Pokémon, a Galarian Moltres, it&#39;s happened again, and it&#39;s looking a little more permanent this time.

While on previous occasions, the mysterious turtle Pokémon returned to being a pendant after accomplishing its task, for whatever reason, it didn&#39;t do so after communicating with Galarian Moltres. Friede was forced to wrap the Pokémon in a towel and sneak it out of the mines to prevent anyone from becoming aware of its existence, and thus possibly putting another target on the Rising Volt Tacklers&#39; back. The episode preview for #24 shows that this mystery Pokémon will still be out and about in the next episode, with no indication that it will return to being a pendant.

Next episode also sees the crew making contact with Liko&#39;s grandmother, the one who gave the pendant to Liko in the first place, so it&#39;s likely some new information about this Pokémon will be revealed. In the vision which this Pokémon showed to Moltres, something called a &#34;Rakua&#34; was mentioned, as something in need of protection. While it&#39;s not clear what Rakua is yet, it&#39;s obviously something important, and may be tied to the pendant Pokémon. Many fans have speculated that this turtle Pokémon is in fact a form of Terapagos, the Legendary Pokémon featuring in Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. That theory could finally be confirmed, at last giving this mystery Pokémon a definitive name.




Regardless of what is learned about this Pokémon, the fact that it&#39;s now a Pokémon and no longer a pendant could be a big problem for the series&#39; heroes. The pendant was easily concealed and transported, but this Pokémon is about the size of a dog, and much harder to hide. That may make it harder to protect from the Explorers, and catching it in a Poké Ball may not be an option. Still, this situation offers a chance to get to know the mystery Pokémon&#39;s personality, and it may well become a key player in Pokémon Horizons&#39; story now that it&#39;s here, and seemingly for good.
