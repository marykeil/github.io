## Literature Review

The complete first season of Ranking of Kings is now available to purchase from Crunchyroll, with some major improvements from the first half.




The second part of the first season of the hit anime Ranking of Kings has been released by Crunchyroll on Blu-ray. The concluding half of the series comes in two variations: standard and limited edition. With the series being a heartwarming, yet high-stakes adventure, fans can&#39;t go wrong with either.




The anime adaptation of Ranking of Kings debuted in 2021 and concluded in 2022. It was adapted from the manga created by Sōsuke Tōka that began serializing in 2017. It currently spans seventeen volumes but has been on hiatus since early 2023. It additionally had a spin-off series, Ranking of Kings: The Treasure Chest of Courage, which has not been collected into a physical edition, as of yet.

Season 1 Part 2 of Ranking of Kings features twelve episodes. It continues the journey of Prince Bojji, the mute and deaf son of a giant king. The series has shared the young hero&#39;s quest to become stronger despite many discounting his abilities and overall potential. The set collecting this portion of the series features two Blu-ray discs and two DVDs, allowing viewers to choose their preferred format or use multiple viewing locations based on their available media player. The primary difference between the standard edition and the limited edition is a few bonus items and a hard case that can hold both parts of the first season (Season 1 Part 1 is sold separately).




The limited edition set features an artbook for the series, detailing character designs, settings, and featuring key art from each episode of Ranking of Kings Season 1. It also includes an embroidered patch of Kage and four art cards. The special features include versions of the opening and closing songs without the text credits, as well as the web previews for each episode. The additional materials for this set (which up the value by about twenty dollars) will be of most interest to big fans of the series, as well as anime collectors who enjoy art cards and customizing their own fandom apparel.

          

Most notable about the Ranking of Kings Season 1 Part 2 Blu-ray set - outside of the incredibly heartwarming story - is the addition of accessibility features. The first part did not include captions, which is a major disservice in that Ranking of Kings is a series about a deaf and mute hero. This prevented fans with similar disabilities from having a proper way to view it outside of streaming. This has been remedied with Season 1 Part 2, which does have an option for English subtitles - granting it far more accessibility than its predecessor. Ranking of Kings fans can now own season 1 completely via Crunchyroll and experience the unconventionally thrilling story of Prince Bojji and the Kingdom of Bosse.




Ranking of Kings Season 1 Part 2 is available now on Crunchyroll for $67.49!
