Throughout the series, there have been many memorable story arcs that have left a lasting impression on viewers. Some are universally praised while others, understandably so, receive a substantial amount of criticism. Though some Naruto arcs have notable flaws, Naruto&#39;s best story arcs balance action, drama, and character development like no other shonen before or since.









 








 10  The Fourth Great Shinobi War 
Chapters 484 - 639 &amp; Episodes 215 - 375 of Shippuden


 







The Fourth Great Shinobi War was undoubtedly one of the most highly anticipated arcs in Naruto history. Never before had the stage been set so precisely, with moving pieces placed all over the ninja world. The return of many once-prominent ninjas and the unification of the world&#39;s great armies was a sight to behold as the arc unfolded. Highlights of this action-packed arc include Kakashi&#39;s bitter fight against Obito in the Kamui realm, the return of big Naruto villains Madara and Itachi, and Might Guy&#39;s Gate of Death. Unfortunately, the arc was also bogged down with just as many fights that lacked significance, such as Kankuro&#39;s Special Ops team battling Sasori and Deidara. While the arc was full of amazing moments, it really needed to narrow down its focus to ensure that every battle was relevant to the plot at hand.
Naruto&#39;s Fourth Shinobi World War arc is actually three arcs consisting of Countdown, Confrontation, and Climax. Given that all the arcs center around one event though, it makes sense to consider them all apart of one mega-arc. 






 9  The Kazekage Rescue Mission 
Chapters 248 - 281 &amp; Episodes 1 - 32 of Shippuden
        

The Kazekage Rescue Mission arc saw Naruto and his friends travel to the Hidden Sand Village in order to rescue Gaara, who had recently become the Kazekage. This arc begins with a great tactical battle between Gaara and Deidara. This arc serves as a great reintroduction to Naruto and Sakura after the timeskip and containts Sakura&#39;s most memorable battle in Naruto history. This is also the first time fans were introduced to Kakashi&#39;s Mangekyo Sharingan in the hunt for Deidara. While this arc develops sympathy for new additions to the cast like Sasori and Granny Chiyo, other characters that should have been prominent were left to the wayside, like Kankuro and Temari.

 8  The Five Kage Summit 
Chapters 453 - 483 &amp; Episodes 197 - 214 of Shippuden
        

Can any fan of Naruto say they weren&#39;t hoping for Danzo to get exactly what he deserved in this arc? The Five Kage Summit is one of the most intense arcs in Naruto, raising the stakes to global levels. The Five Kage Summit also has some of Naruto&#39;s most memorable scenes, with Sasuke standing on the ceiling, looking down at every single Kage at the summit after cutting their banners down. The utter contempt Sasuke displays in this arc is so raw that one can&#39;t help but stand in awe of how far he&#39;s willing to go after learning the truth about Itachi. The emergence of his Susanoo during the battle against the Raikage and Gaara was also incredible. That being said, there are, again, characters that feel as though they should be important in these scenarios and just aren&#39;t. Mei, the Mizukage, notoriously gets little time to do anything relevant in her introductory arc, and the Konoha 11 banding together to stop Sasuke ultimately amounts to nothing.

 7  The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant 
Chapters 363 - 383 &amp; Episodes 127 - 133 of Shippuden
        

The tale of Jiraiya is hands down one of Naruto&#39;s most emotional arcs. The dilapidated setting of the war-torn Hidden Rain Village makes for a backdrop that perfectly encapsulates this arc&#39;s tone. Jiraiya&#39;s valiant battle against Pain is heartbreaking; watching the fight draw longer and longer as the situation only grows increasingly dire had fans waiting for each development with bated breath. The reveal of Pain&#39;s abilities in this arc are also handled well, even more so than in the Pain Arc itself. He feels almost unstoppable in the battle against Jiraiya, even when Incomplete Sage Mode is used. On that note, one of the few downsides to this lengthy battle is how Jiraiya so easily loses against the Six Paths of Pain. While it certainly plays up the danger of Pain, Jiraiya himself more or less goes out with a whimper, taking away from a lot of the weight that was once attached to the title &#34;Sannin.&#34;





 6  The Konoha Crush Arc 
Chapters 116 - 138 &amp; Episodes 68 - 80 of Naruto
        

The Konoha Crush arc deals with the aftermath of the Chunin Exams and Orochimaru&#39;s plan to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village. The alliance between Sound and Sand villages had been teased ever since the beginning of the Chunin Exams and seeing it come to fruition was truly a spectacle. Orochimaru&#39;s relentless plotting to seek revenge against the Third Hokage is also a highlight, and the temporary resurrection of the First and Second Hokages brings the threat level of this arc into a league of its own. Moreover, this arc treated fans to the giant kaiju battle between Gamabunta and Shukaku. This arc does still fall flat in a few areas, however, as it has to compete with some of the much more interesting fights that preceded it in the Chunin Exam arc.





 5  The Chunin Exams 
Chapters 34 -115 &amp; Episodes 20 - 67 of Naruto


 







Unsurprisingly, the Chunin Exams are often included in lists of Naruto&#39;s best story arcs- and for good reason. One of Naruto&#39;s biggest draws early on was the fact that every ninja had different abilities and talents, creating a diverse landscape of abilities. The Chunin Exams capitalized on this by shifting focus to side characters. The most memorable fight from this Naruto arc has to be Rock Lee vs Gaara, a fight that features none of the main protagonists. This story arc is set up similar to a tournament arc, only with more intricate rules and dangers, showing clear growth from the rudimentary foundations of the genre set by industry giants like Dragon Ball.

 4  The Fated Battle Between Brothers 
Chapters 384 - 412 &amp; Episodes 134 - 143 of Shippuden
        

The Fated Battle Between Brothers arc is a standout moment in Naruto, showcasing the intense turmoil and complex emotions between Sasuke and Itachi. This arc is a gripping examination of the bond between siblings and the lengths they will go to protect one another. The battle scenes are visually stunning, and the emotional weight of the story is palpable. This is the moment in Naruto when most fans fell in love with the character of Itachi- the truth of his tragic fate as a tool of war is unsettling to say the least. This arc also introduces fans to some of the flashiest abilities in the series - such as the Susanoo and Sasuke&#39;s signature Kirin. The aftermath of this arc ultimately defines the rest of the series going forwards.





 3  Pain&#39;s Assault 
Chapters 413 - 453 &amp; Episodes 152 - 175 of Shippuden


 







This arc is notable for its high stakes and the sense of danger that permeates every moment. Prominent characters seem to drop like flies as Pain decimates the Leaf Village without anyone to stop his path of carnage. Naruto&#39;s entrance during this arc is one of the most memorable in the entire series, destroying one of Pain&#39;s bodies instantly just as it seemed the Leaf Village had run out of hope. The character development in this arc is also notable, with Naruto confronting his ideals and grappling with the harsh realities of the world presented to him by Nagato. In retrospect, though, while the Pain arc is the apex of Naruto for many, it still underserves many characters like Hinata who is reduced to a plot device. Additionally, Naruto&#39;s promise of bringing peace to the Rain Village is never fulfilled, causing his final speech to ring hollow.





 2  The Land of Waves 
Chapters 1 - 33 &amp; Episodes 1 - 19 of Naruto
        

The Land of Waves arc is Naruto&#39;s first real foray into serious storytelling, and it sets the tone for the rest of the series. The arc introduces readers to the harsh realities of the ninja world and the complex relationships that exist between ninja, their comrades, and their clients. The story is brought to life through the tragic relationship between Zabuza and Haku, which is heart-wrenching. It is all too easy to forget that Naruto is essentially a story about child soldiers and the devastation of war, but this arc pulls no punches when putting the disgusting reality of the ninja world on display.





 1  The Sasuke Retrieval Arc 
Chapters 172 - 238 &amp; Episodes 107 - 135 of Naruto
        

For many fans, the Sasuke Retrieval Arc is the definitive Naruto story, encapsulating everything that makes the series great. This arc sees Naruto and his friends going on a dangerous mission to rescue Sasuke from the clutches of the Sound Four. The stakes are high, the action is intense, and the emotional payoff is huge. The Sasuke Retrieval Arc also manages to balance having the spotlight on multiple characters outside the main protagonists in intense and complex battles that don&#39;t take away from the plot&#39;s progression. This arc is a culmination of everything that has come before it, and it sets the stage for the rest of the series. It is a testament to Naruto&#39;s ability to tell complex, emotionally resonant stories, and it remains one of the best arcs in shonen history.

From the emotional depth of the Land of Waves arc to the intense action of the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Naruto has consistently demonstrated its ability to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact. It&#39;s no wonder that Naruto remains one of the most beloved anime franchises of all time, and these arcs are certainly a testament to its enduring popularity.
