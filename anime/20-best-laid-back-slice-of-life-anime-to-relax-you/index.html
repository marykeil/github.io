  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Whether they take place in the Japanese countryside or otherworldly magical settings, these best laid-back slice-of-life anime are a relaxing watch.</p>
<p>While slice-of-life is its own genre, it is certainly a diverse one. Slice-of-life anime can be about school life, city life, rural life, and can even have a slightly mystical twist. More than just simple though, all these series can almost be healing as their more peaceful nature shines through. The best laid-back slice-of-life anime are peaceful enough to make fans forget the world and their problems for a little while, and sometimes, that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>20  Silver Spoon</p>
<p>Year Released   2013    Episodes   22    Where to Stream it   Funimation <br>
Based on the manga of the same name by Fullmetal Alchemist creator Hiromu Arakawa, Silver Spoon is a slice-of-life anime about a young man named Yuugo Hachiken who moves from the city to a rural town after failing his high school entrance exams. Far from the action and intrigue of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa pulled on her own background growing up on a farm for Silver Spoon. What this series does share with Fullmetal Alchemist is Arakwa&rsquo;s keen eye for character as the series&rsquo; cast is endlessly entertaining.</p>
<p>19  Natsume&rsquo;s Book of Friends</p>
<p>Year Released   2008    Episodes   74    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation <br>
Natsume&rsquo;s Book of Friends is about the titular Natsume, a young man who can talk to spirits called yokai. After the death of his grandmother, Natsume is given an incredibly valuable book containing the names of more than a hundred Yokai who were previously in the service of Natsume&rsquo;s grandmother. Natsume makes it his mission to nullify the contracts of each spirit in the book so that they can move on to the afterlife. While Natsume&rsquo;s Book of Friends does feature more than a few evil yokai that require a bit more effort to confront, the series is quite calming with its focus on nature and healing. As strange as it sounds, an anime about ghosts and spirits can still be one of the best laid-back slice-of-life-anime.</p>
<p>18  Komi Can&rsquo;t Communicate</p>
<p>Year Released   2021    Episodes   24    Where to Stream it   Netflix <br>
Komi Can&rsquo;t Communicate focuses on a girl named Komi who becomes popular in high school due to her seemingly stoic beauty. Despite the attention she gets though, Komi&rsquo;s apparent stoicism is actually due to difficulties in communicating with others. Together with an average-appearing boy named Hitohito Tadano, Komi makes it her goal to break out of the shell of anxiety and make 100 friends. Though the series does deal with Komi&rsquo;s anxiety and inability to communicate, the series is overall quite positive and affirming as viewers watch Komi grow more and more comfortable around others.</p>

<p>Year Released   2011    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation <br>
More on the silly end of slice-of-life, Nichijou is a hilarious series where the stakes are small and the jokes are big. This slice-of-life classic follows a group of girls as they navigate life in a small town. What makes Nichijou so remarkable is how well it uses animation to tell its jokes. Instead of just relying on funny dialogue or situations, the series truly gets the most out of being an anime by including plenty of visual gags that are an absolute riot. When looking for slice-of-life comedies, anime fans really can&rsquo;t go wrong with Nichijou.</p>
