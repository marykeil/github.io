Far from the action and intrigue of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa pulled on her own background growing up on a farm for Silver Spoon.

While Natsume&#39;s Book of Friends does feature more than a few evil yokai that require a bit more effort to confront, the series is quite calming with its focus on nature and healing.
