## Literature Review

One Piece voice actor Ado takes fans by surprise with her unexpected cover of Tokyo&#39;s Ghoul&#39;s infamous anime opening, Unravel, executed to perfection.




The voice of Uta from One Piece&#39;s latest hit movie Film: Red, Ado, recently released a cover of Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s infamous opening theme, Unravel, and the result is absolutely stunning. As far as anime openings go, Unravel is easily among the most widely known anime soundtracks, and though the original is incomparable, Ado reinvents the infamous opening theme in a truly mesmerizing way that&#39;s hard to ignore.




Released on 13 December 2023 as part of her latest compilation album titled, Ado&#39;s Utattemita Album, Ado&#39;s take on Unravel puts a subtle yet refreshing spin on the opening theme by leaning more into the alternative, heavy metal aspects of the original. The cover is an absolute treat to the ears, with the Film: Red star proving not only her versatility but also her crisp vocal technique, which catapulted her into global mainstream popularity following her role as Uta.


 

Moreover, Ado&#39;s voice perfectly fits the unique tone of Unravel, and it isn&#39;t difficult to imagine Uta herself singing the song, given the dark undertones of her character which align perfectly with those of Tokyo Ghoul and its infamous anime opening.

                  Spy x Family Season 2&#39;s New Trailer Showcases Opening Theme From One Piece&#39;s Ado   The second season of the popular anime Spy X Family is almost here with a trailer that showcases the opening sung by Ado of One Piece Film: Red fame.   





 Ado&#39;s Versatility Shines in New Unravel Cover 
          

Ado&#39;s latest cover is yet another reminder of her sheer versatility and jaw-dropping vocal technique, which first took fans by storm in Film: Red. The singer&#39;s talent is apparent from the very first lines of the opening theme, New Genesis, and shines similarly through her newest cover of Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s Unravel.

The cover showcases her ability to adapt her voice to a variety of genres, which is no easy feat. Ado effortlessly transitions between the iconic whisper-like tone of the opening and intense vocal growls which take first-time listeners by surprise. While it is difficult to imagine Ado&#39;s otherwise crystal clear voice being capable of such well-executed vocal fry, Ado executes the cover to perfection, so much so that it is hard to believe her version isn&#39;t the original.




                  One Piece&#39;s Reboot Has The Perfect Chance To Make One Character Truly Canon   The One Piece is set to be a full-fledged remake of the anime, and with that, it has the chance to fully establish one beloved character as canon.   



 Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s Infamous Opening Fits Uta&#39;s Character Perfectly 
          

Other than being well-executed, Ado&#39;s choice to cover Unravel also fits Uta&#39;s character surprisingly well. While Tokyo Ghoul couldn&#39;t be more different from One Piece&#39;s lighthearted pirate adventure, Uta&#39;s character holds a lot of darkness behind her bright colorful exterior. In fact, the angst explored in Unravel through its lyrics can seemingly be applied just as well to Uta as Kaneki.

Much like Kaneki, Uta too finds herself falling over to the dark side, taken over by a monster (which is the Tot Musica in her case), making it easy for fans to imagine Uta singing Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s intense opening. Moreover, Unravel would fit right in with some of Uta&#39;s more hardcore performances in Film: Red such as Backlight and Tot Musica.




          

Nonetheless, Ado&#39;s role as Uta has certainly left a favorable impression on many, and given Film: Red&#39;s widespread success, she will likely continue to grow in popularity in the coming years. Either way, fans of One Piece can only hope to see Uta&#39;s voice actor featured more prominently in anime going forward.
