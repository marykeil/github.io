## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #4 will begin a new arc of the series and follow up on the post-credits scene with Yukime in episode #3.




Since episode #3 resolved the first arc of the season, The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #4 will begin a new adventure for Cid and his friends. Despite this, there are some hints as to what the new arc may entail, especially given episode #3&#39;s post-credits scene. However, in a show as unpredictable as The Eminence in Shadow, it is never certain where the plot will go.

 What Happened in The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #3? 
          




After Cid left the roof, Claire and Mary soon arrived and Elizabeth used Claire&#39;s blood to revive herself. The vampire queen then became an incredibly powerful final boss, even giving Beta and her Shadow Garden followers a tough time. However, Elizabeth&#39;s vampirism interacted strangely with Claire&#39;s possession, enabling the Witch of Calamity Aurora to briefly possess Cid&#39;s sister until her body gave out. Luckily, at that point Cid appeared and fought Elizabeth, ending the battle with an atomic healing attack that cured the ghouls and vampires of their bloodlust. Afterward, Cid and Claire left the Lawless City and Shadow met up with the tyrant of the White Tower Yukime in a post-credits scene.



 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #4 Will Show More of the White Queen 
          

Based on the post-credits scene, episode #4 will likely begin with Shadow and Yukime discussing the aftermath of the events in the Lawless City. Given the interest Yukime showed in Shadow during the last arc, she will likely try to ally herself with him and Shadow Garden. It is unclear what the ultimate purpose of this alliance would be, but given the shadiness of Yukime&#39;s operations, it likely won&#39;t be altruistic. Although given the chaotic nature of The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s hero, this may not be an issue. Alternatively, Yukime&#39;s interest in Shadow may have been as a potential rival, which would make her similar to the tyrant of the Black Tower Juggernaut, who wanted to fight Shadow Garden again after they saved the Lawless City.




Episode #4 will likely clear up this uncertainty of Yukime&#39;s intentions and in doing so introduce the main conflict of the next arc. Whatever that next arc is will likely be as chaotic and fun as the beginning of the season. If it is, then Season 2 episode #4 may live up to The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s stellar premiere.

Don&#39;t miss The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #4 when it airs on HIDIVE on October 25, 2023.
