# Saitama s New Power In One-Punch Man Literally Breaks Reality


## SUMMARY 



  Saitama breaking the fourth wall in One-Punch Man #194 has fans questioning its significance and what it means for the story.   Breaking the fourth wall suggests that Saitama is aware he is in a story, but it could just be a one-off gag and not a major aspect of his character.   Another subtle fourth wall break earlier in the chapter hints at Saitama&#39;s awareness and may imply more to his fourth-wall understanding. Future chapters will reveal the truth.

## Literature Review

Chapter 194 sees Saitama do something that he&#39;s never before done in One-Punch Man&#39;s story: smash his way through the fourth wall.




Warning: Spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter #194 (Japanese Release)One-Punch Man&#39;s Saitama has had some pretty crazy abilities over the years, from obliterating monsters to sneezing away Jupiter, but his latest feat in chapter #194 saw Saitama busting his way through the fourth wall. While it might seem like a simple joke, the scene has had fans very worked up since its release because of what it may represent.




In the chapter, Saitama is growing frustrated with Flashy Flash, Genos, and Speed-o&#39;-Sound Sonic, and calls King to hang out. While they&#39;re spending time together, Saitama shows King a picture of Manako (Oculette in the Viz translation), the monster who helped him and Flashy Flash in the Monster Association HQ. They quickly set up a trap and catch Manako, with Saitama reporting back to Flashy Flash that they did it &#34;in about three panels.&#34;

          

Despite some gags that &#34;lean&#34; on the fourth wall, Saitama himself has never directly broken the fourth wall within the story of One-Punch Man before. The question remains, though: just how significant is this break?


 Saitama&#39;s Fourth Wall Break May Be Important 
          




When a character breaks the fourth wall, it suggests that the character themselves is aware that they are in a story, and that the world in which they live isn&#39;t the real world. A well-known example from Western comics would be Marvel&#39;s Deadpool, who regularly breaks the fourth wall by referencing the fact he&#39;s in a comic book. Breaking the fourth wall is a big part of Deadpool&#39;s character, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a major aspect of a character. It could also simply be a one-off gag, as seems to be the case here, and shouldn&#39;t be read into too much.

On the other hand, while this is the most direct fourth wall break in the chapter, there&#39;s actually another one slightly earlier that&#39;s more subtle. When Flashy Flash begins his duel with Saitama at the start of the chapter, Saitama moves very quickly, suddenly appearing close to Flash. So suddenly, in fact, that the image of Saitama wasn&#39;t redrawn, but rather was blown up and copied, as if he moved too fast to be drawn in higher detail. This also qualifies as a fourth-wall break, as the character&#39;s abilities in the story are dictating how the comic itself is drawn. That, in combination with the found Manako in &#34;three panels&#34; comment, suggests that there may be a little more to Saitama&#39;s fourth-wall awareness.




While it&#39;s not clear yet what significance, if any, Saitama&#39;s fourth-wall break has, it&#39;s certainly a moment that has caught the attention of fans. A character being aware of their own nature as a fictional creation can be a very powerful thing, allowing them to surpass the limits of someone who still believes themselves to be real by acknowledging that their limits are as fictional as they are. It may even be that being aware of the fourth wall is the true secret to Saitama&#39;s power in One-Punch Man, but that&#39;s something that only future chapters will be able to prove for certain.
