                  What&#39;s New On Crunchyroll In Fall 2023   The Fall 2023 season of anime is about to start, and here are all the new anime people can expect to watch on Crunchyroll throughout the season.   



 What Happened In SHY Episode #2 
          




SHY episode #2, “With All of My Heart”, continued episode #1’s cliffhanger of Teru reuniting with Iko Koishikawa, the girl she failed to save as Shy properly. After learning that Iko didn’t hate Shy for causing her to get hurt, a mysterious boy named Stigma appeared and placed a ring around Iko’s finger that caused her to transform into a monster. The transformation also heightened Iko’s negative emotions, causing her to reveal that she has survivor’s guilt over her parents dying in a fire, and after blaming herself for how much people started harassing Shy, Iko’s self-hatred grew to the point that she tried to kill herself.

                  10 Best New Anime to Stream in Fall 2023   Fall 2023 is filled with many incredible anime to stream, from sequels in beloved franchises to completely new shows in various genres.   

Teru, refusing to allow that, transformed into Shy to fight Iko and calm her down. After telling Iko to release her hatred onto her, Shy, who also had to deal with losing a loved one at a young age, reached out to Iko’s heart and canceled her monstrous transformation. Shy then imparted to Iko the importance of forming connections with others and how the best way to alleviate her guilt would be to keep being kind to others, and on that note, Iko finally thanked Shy for saving her life.






 SHY Is Far More Of A Magical Girl Anime Than A Superhero Anime 
          

The biggest takeaway from SHY episode #2 is that despite how it’s been framed, this is much more of a magical girl anime than a superhero anime. Between Shy’s transformation sequences, the various superpowers being fueled by emotion, and how the conflict with Iko was resolved by Shy appealing to her emotions instead of fighting her, the series appears to have more in common with magical girl anime than superhero anime, as those elements are very common trademarks of the genre. Of course, it’s all still framed as a superhero story, but episode #2 clarifies that labeling it as just that would be far too simple.

                  New Superhero Anime is the Biggest Refresh the Genre&#39;s Had In Years   A new trailer for Eightbit&#39;s upcoming adaptation of SHY has come out, along with a confirmed premiere date set for Fall 2023   




SHY leaning more towards magical girl anime, of course, does wonders to help give it its own identity. Over the past decade or so, there has been an overabundance of superhero shows and movies coming out that often cover similar themes and stories. SHY invites obvious comparisons to My Hero Academia, so taking such clear inspiration from magical girl anime gives it a unique hook that can help it stand out from its contemporaries in both the East and the West. The series has only just started, but nonetheless, it will be great to see how Shy develops that identity in the upcoming weeks.

Watch SHY episode #3 when it airs on Monday, October 16, on Crunchyroll.
