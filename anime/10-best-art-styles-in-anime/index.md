## Literature Review

While every anime has its own style, there are some that stand out from the crowd with their distinct artwork and unique visuals.




An anime&#39;s art style is one of the first things to stand out to viewers. Unlike manga, which uses stationary, black-and-white artwork, anime has more freedom in how it uses its visuals to attract an audience. Some anime, like Devilman Crybaby, are appealing for their unique, but not necessarily attractive, art styles. This is different from many of the other series that use colorful visuals to attract attention.
It&#39;s important to draw a distinction between art style and animation. Art style refers to how the anime looks in still frames, and includes character and background designs, color palettes, and overall esthetics. Animation, on the other hand, refers to the actual movement of objects, and is characterized by the visual dynamics and fluidity of motions. The art styles in these anime have contributed to making them standout hits among viewers and fandom.

Based on the Lupin III manga by Monkey Punch
        

  Number of Episodes   13    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll, HIDIVE, Pluto TV    
This title is the first in the Lupin III franchise to feature someone other than Arsene Lupin III as the protagonist. It tells the origin story of Fujiko Mine, a professional criminal, as she goes on adventures and meets the rest of the characters for the first time. Unlike the adaptations released prior, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine follows the manga&#39;s more mature themes, and uses shading and darker colors to complement it. The series received acclaim for its visuals, which are reminiscent of the classic esthetics from the 1960s and 70s. Even though doesn&#39;t feature thrilling heists like other Lupin III adaptations, this anime is worth watching for its artwork alone.

Based on the manga by Hirohiko Araki

Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure has a distinct art style that makes it one of the most recognizable anime of all time. It chronicles the adventures of the Joestar family throughout generations, and focuses on a different protagonist, or &#34;JoJo&#34; in every part. While the series&#39; artwork has changed over the years, it maintains the flamboyant fashions and unique styles of JoJo&#39;s characters and the shading techniques characteristic of Hiroiko Araki&#39;s style.
Every season is visually appealing, but part 5, also known as Golden Wind, stands out with its detailed character designs and more realistic proportions. It emphasizes many of Jojo&#39;s trademark features, like excessive posing and bold color use, and is the most similar to the manga in terms of artwork. Moreover, it does an excellent job of showcasing Italy&#39;s picturesque landscapes.

Original series produced by Sunrise
        

  Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll, Tubi    
While the series is known for its philosophical themes and mix of genres, Cowboy Bebop has a distinct art style that sets it apart. Set in the year 2071, it tells the story of a group of bounty hunters who chase criminals across the solar system. The show&#39;s creator, Shinichiro Watanabe, drew inspiration from different sources, including classic sci-fi and film-noir movies, to create his own style.
While the series doesn&#39;t have the crystal clear visuals of today&#39;s anime, its gritty esthetics do an excellent job of creating a mood befitting its ideas of loneliness and existentialism. The show is often credited with creating a new genre and style, paving the way for more mature storytelling and Western influences in anime.

An underrated gem on Netflix, Great Pretender is the story of Makoto Edamura, a small-time con artist from Japan. After he meets Laurent Thierry, Makoto joins him and his associates on a series of international heists. While the character designs are great, the anime&#39;s expressive backgrounds make the artwork stand by giving the impression of a watercolor painting. 
The scenery blends colors and creates gradients that make its visuals pop. It&#39;s worth noting how it uses bright imagery to make bustling real-life locations, like Singapore and Los Angeles, look even more vibrant.

 6  Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&#39; Retro Art Style Makes It One of the Best Video Game Adaptations 
Original series produced by Studio Trigger


 







  Number of Episodes   10    Where to Stream   Netflix    
If Studio Trigger is known for anything, it&#39;s their trademark style of using vivid color schemes and bold visuals. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners incorporates these features into its artwork, whose stunning visuals make it a worthy successor to the studio&#39;s most esthetic release, Promare. Acting as a prequel for the video game Cyberpunk 2077, it tells the story of David Martinez, who becomes a lawless mercenary, or &#34;edgerunner,&#34; in Night City.
The art style uses intense neons and contrasting techniques to create a hallucinatory world that is both intrusive and appealing to the eye. Staying true to its origins, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners borrows inspiration from retro art styles, and effectively conveys the &#34;high-tech, low life&#34; feeling characteristic of its genre.

 5  Studio Ghibli&#39;s Movies Shows How Children See the World 
Original films produced by Studio Ghibli
        

  Number of Episodes   23 movies    Where to Stream   Netflix    
Studio Ghibli&#39;s classic art style is one of the most recognizable in the anime community. One of its key features is magic realism, which blends fantastical and realistic elements. This leads to the gorgeous visuals, notably those found in Spirited Away, Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, and Princess Mononoke, all of which incorporate fantasy elements, such as witches and wizards, into an otherwise ordinary setting.
The studio combines this with soft, vivid tones to show how the world looks through the eyes of a child, evoking a sense of nostalgia for many people. The films include scenes showing their characters in a highly detailed, natural environment. This is one of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s signature esthetics, and it seeks to illustrate humanity&#39;s connection with nature.

 4  Mononoke Has a Style Inspired By Traditional Japanese Art 
Original anime produced by Toei Animation
        

  Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream   Netflix, Crunchyroll    
Mononoke tells the story of the &#34;Medicine Seller,&#34; as he wanders around Japan and exorcises &#34;mononoke,&#34; which are spirits born from negative human emotions. While most horror stories use a dark atmosphere to invoke feelings of dread, Mononoke uses bright colors and surrealist animation.
The avant-garde art style is heavily influenced by traditional Japanese art, particularly the woodblock prints and paintings of Ukiyo-e, from which it borrows its &#34;flat,&#34; two-dimensional appearance, detailed textures, and bold linework. The anime is considered a different kind of horror that uses its otherworldly feel and fever-dream esthetic to cause psychological discomfort.

This visually striking anime combines steampunk with vampires in an unusual way. Instead of the darker color palettes associated with these elements, The Case Study of Vanitas uses vibrant shades in its artwork and makes the story feel more like a fairy tale. The story is set in a fictional version of 19th century Paris and follows Noé Archiviste, as he works with a doctor named Vanitas to find a cure for depraved vampires.

  Number of Episodes   13 &#43; OVA    Where to Stream   Netflix

The story follows Violet Evergarden, who reintegrates into society after the war and, through her interactions with the people around her, discovers what it means to live.
The anime&#39;s esthetic compliments the story&#39;s emotional nature through its use of cooler colors, which bring a sense of both calmness and melancholy. The use of lighting in the background is breathtaking, especially for scenes involving water, and look like they came straight out of a painting.

 1  Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo Blends Two Art Styles to Create Unique Visuals 
Original series produced by Gonzo


 







  Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll    
Gankutsuou is an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas&#39; 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, and follows much of the original story aside from a few differences. It&#39;s an avant-garde piece that combines Japanese Ukiyo-e with Western Impressionism, particularly the works of Gustav Klimt. The series employs color palettes befitting its aristocratic setting and uses textures on every visible surface.
It&#39;s worth noting that the patterns stay in place even when the object moves, creating a psychedelic effect that contrasts with the characters&#39; softer outlines. The art is purely experimental and highly unusual, but is one of the most innovative styles in anime. The unique visuals enhance the story and immerse the viewer into the world, making Gankutsuou&#39;s art style the best in anime.
