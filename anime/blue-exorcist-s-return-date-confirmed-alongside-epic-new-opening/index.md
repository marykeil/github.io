## Literature Review

The release date for Blue Exorcist season 3 has just been confirmed in a promotional video that features the opening song.




The official website of Blue Exorcist has just released a promotional video that features the opening song. This comes about a month after confirming that season 3 is slated for winter 2023. As the year approaches the end, Blue Exorcist&#39;s return after more than 6 years makes it a front-runner for one of the most hype anime of 2024.




Inspired from the 2005 movie Brothers Grimm, Blue Exorcist is scheduled to air in January 2024. The new season will adapt the Shimane Illuminati Arc.


 

There has already been a great reception for the opening song, and despite it being short it sounds great and really in tune with the series. Blue Exorcist is often an example of music done right, and this theme song is growing its portfolio of hit anime songs.

Season 3 Will Start Airing In January

 

The opening song will be performed by UVERworld and will be titled &#34;Eye’s Sentry&#34;. They are one of the most popular bands in the anime community and have worked on various high-profile anime such as My Hero Academia, Bleach, The Promised Neverland, and The Seven Deadly Sins, and were behind Blue Exorcist&#39;s first opening song which is one of the most popular ever. Their return brings great nostalgia to fans of the series, as their song was one of the highlights of the show. Truly, UVERworld being chosen for this role was a great decision.




UVERworld isn&#39;t the only returning feature. Nobuhiko Okamoto will once again voice the main character Rin Okumura, and Jun Fukuyama will voice Rin&#39;s brother Yukio Okumura. The voice actors will largely remain the same, but the staff will have some big changes. Studio VOLN will take over the animation from A-1 Pictures and Daisuke Yoshida will direct the season. The most interesting addition to the team is Kohta Yamamoto who was behind the sound design of Attack On Titan season 4.

January 2024 is jam-packed with anime such as Classroom Of The Elite, Solo Leveling, Metallic Rouge, and many others. Blue Exorcist is just the latest addition to this winter&#39;s lineup and is one fans are looking forward to. For half a decade people have been waiting patiently for the return of this popular series, and considering that season 3 will adapt a fan-favorite arc, Blue Exorcist&#39;s return will be welcome with open arms, and will hopefully exceed expectations.
