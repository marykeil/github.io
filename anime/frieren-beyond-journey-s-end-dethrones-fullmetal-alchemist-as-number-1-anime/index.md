## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End has maintained its n. 1 spot on MyAnimeList for more than a week, a feat that few other anime were able to achieve.




Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End is one of the biggest anime of 2023, and it’s officially dethroned Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood on MyAnimeList. MyAnimeList is one of the most popular social networking platforms for anime, and for years, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has been the #1 anime according to its users. Brotherhood is often regarded as one of the best anime ever made, so its ranking on MyAnimeList is another sign of its esteemed pedigree.






While it&#39;s not unheard of for an anime to briefly surpass Fullmetal Alchemist on MyAnimeList, Frieren maintained its spot for more than a week, which is unusual and makes this feat a lot more impressive.




Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has more than earned its placement as the top anime on MyAnimeList, but it’s just lost that status to 2023’s Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End. Frieren has been one of the most talked about anime of both the fall 2023 season and 2023, as a whole, and as of late November 2023, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End officially surpassed Fullmetal Alchemist as the top anime on MyAnimeList.

          

It’s very likely that Frieren won’t be able to maintain that status forever, but with how great of an anime Frieren has been, it’s easy to see how it was able to achieve such a feat in the first place.

 Frieren Isn’t The First Anime To Beat Fullmetal Alchemist On MyAnimeList 
          

As great as it is to see Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End surpass Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood on MyAnimeList, it’s not the first anime to do so. While Brotherhood has continually reigned as the top anime on MyAnimeList, there have been times when it’s been surpassed by other anime like Attack on Titan and Fruits Basket, and more recently, Oshi no Ko. It’s happened numerous times only for Brotherhood to eventually regain the top spot, and it’s likely that Frieren will also lose its position at the top of MyAnimeList before long.

As for why other anime aren’t able to stay ahead of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood on MyAnimeList, there isn’t an exact answer. In previous cases of the series being usurped, there have been accusations of fans of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood review bombing other anime to keep it at the top, but it’s unknown if that’s the sole reason or if genuine negative opinions on the other shows also played a part in it to any degree. Whatever the case, Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End likely won’t be at the top of MyAnimeList for as long as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was, but it’s still a great sign of its overall quality, regardless.






 How Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End Earned The #1 Spot On MyAnimeList 
          

Even if it might not be permanent, it makes plenty of sense why Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End was able to surpass Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood on MyAnimeList. With its expertly crafted, melancholic story brilliantly brought to life by the stellar direction of Keiichiro Saito and the fantastical score of Evan Call, Frieren immediately became a hit with fans and critics alike, and it’s already being seen by many as the best anime of 2023. Every episode has been nothing but a visual and narrative spectacle, so even if it doesn’t last, Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End has more than earned its place above Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood on MyAnimeList.
