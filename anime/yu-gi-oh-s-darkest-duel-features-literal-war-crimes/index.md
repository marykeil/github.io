## Literature Review

Many fans of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! anime especially enjoy its darker moments, but they may have missed the actual darkest duel in the franchise.





Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc V is arguably the darkest series in the franchise thus far. The plot of Arc V centers around a multidimensional war raging between different dimensions that represent the past Yu-Gi-Oh! series. The main instigator of this war is the Fusion Dimension, which invaded the Xyz dimension first and oppressed its people. This led some duelists of this dimension to start a revolution, which brought some of them to the Standard dimension where Arc V&#39;s protagonist Yuya lives. However, the Fusion dimension also sent agents to track down Yuya and learn the secret of his new summoning technique.





 Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc V Darkest Duel Includes A War Criminal 
          

The conflict between these two groups comes to a head when Shun, an Xyz revolutionary, battles Sora, a Fusion agent, in the Arc League Championship. Their duel takes place in a holographic reconstruction of Shun&#39;s home city, reminding him of what it was once like. As the duel continues, Sora reveals his true sadistic colors as he starts to reminisce about hunting Xyz dimension citizens like animals. As Sora nostalgically recollects his war crimes, their battle begins to destroy the holographic city, making it resemble the warzone it would become after the Fusion invasion. This turns the duel into a powerful visual metaphor for the cruelty of war.

Given its dark subject, this is easily the darkest duel in the franchise. It is also one of the best duels in any Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, both because of how dark it gets and because of how Shun responds to Sora&#39;s sadism. Despite Sora bringing out a variety of powerful monsters, Shun is able to ultimately win the game by bringing out seemingly weak monsters that turn that power against its wielder. This makes Shun&#39;s victory one of the most satisfying underdog stories in the franchise and proves that even in the bleakest of circumstances hope can still prevail.






 Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc V Missed A Lot Of Its Potential 
          

Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc V would eventually squander much of the potential of its multidimensional war, leading many fans to view the series as a whole as a mixed bag. However, its Shun vs. Sora duel still stands out as a high point of not just the series but the franchise as a whole, proving that duels could be a powerful vessel for storytelling. Thus, even if fans of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! anime never watched or cared about any of its spinoffs, they owe it to themselves to watch Shun&#39;s game against Sora and see how dark and powerful duels can get.
