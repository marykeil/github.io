## Literature Review

After a successful second season, Jujutsu Kaisen has been announced to receive season 3 which will adapt the Culling Games arc.





With the finale of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s successful second season, the official website of the anime has confirmed a third season that will adapt the Culling Games arc. The Shibuya Incident arc has been completed, receiving rave reviews for its amazing animation and faithfulness to the source material.




The twenty-third and final episode of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season prompted the renewal of the series, to no one&#39;s surprise, considering how popular the anime is. To celebrate the completion of season two and to confirm season 3, Toho Animation released a teaser trailer for season 3 showcasing some manga panels from the upcoming Culling Game arc.


 

The new season will adapt the Culling Games arc, an arc that possibly has more epic fights than the Shibuya Incident arc. Although no other information besides the confirmation of the season and a teaser trailer was made available, fans are beyond ecstatic that Gege Akutami&#39;s hit manga will receive yet another season.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Creator Confirms the Manga Will End in 2024   Gege Akutami has confirmed during the latest Jump Festa that Jujutsu Kaisen will most likely end in 2024.   





 Jujutsu Kaisen Heads To Another Violent Arc 
          

As per the official X account of Jujutsu Kaisen, the third season has been greenlit. Garnering millions of views within hours, the post went viral showing just how much the anime is dominating the industry. The teaser trailer shows the new main villain, Kamo Noritoshi, Choso, Itadori, Megumi, and Yuta, with the description of the plot revealing that there will be one-on-one death battles involved. With Yuta Okkotsu and Yuji Itadori seemingly facing off, the Culling Games arc should feature battles between foes and allies alike, in a brutal tournament that should feature some of the most hype battles in the series.


 




There is no current release date, but it is easy to predict. Considering how the second season was released 2 years after the first, the third season will probably follow the same timeline at a minimum. Furthermore, Mappa is currently working on the Chainsaw Man movie, the second season of Hell&#39;s Paradise, and probably season 3 of Vinland Saga, which might push back the release date even further. There is some good news, however. Since Jujutsu Kaisen is their biggest anime, production could start soon or even immediately, and the third season might be given priority over Mappa&#39;s other series.

                  Every Jujutsu Kaisen Arc Ranked From Worst to Best   After being serialized for over 5 years Jujutsu Kaisen has a variety of arcs, all of which are great but some of which are better than others.   

More information such as a trailer, cast and staff, and release date will be revealed in due time. Despite being controversial in the Jujutsu Kaisen fandom and considered a filler arc, the Culling Games arc will surely be a hit considering the intense fights that will be heightened by Mappa&#39;s incredible animation. The finale of Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 might sadden a lot, but they can rejoice now that the anime is returning for season 3 with The Culling Game.
