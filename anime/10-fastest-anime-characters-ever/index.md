## Literature Review

These blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-them speedsters are the fastest anime characters of all time.





Speedsters are some of the most valuable members of their team. They’re confident show-offs who delight in pushing themselves to the limit and dazzling people with their power. Though sometimes that confidence can come back to bite them, most often their speed propels them easily to the top. Here are ten of the fastest characters who ever graced an anime screen, ranked in no particular order.









 








 10  Sonic The Hedgehog 
Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie - Sonic X
        

Sonic is proud to call himself the fastest thing alive, and he’s always eager to prove it wherever he appears. Anime productions such as the 1996 OVA Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie and the 2003 series Sonic X are no exception. While it might take some prodding to get him to fight when he’d rather chill, when he does get serious nothing can stop him.
While a concrete top speed for Sonic has never been confirmed, he has been clocked at up to 362 miles per hour and, as his name implies, should be able to reach the speed of sound: 767 miles per hour! Moving at hypersonic speeds, he makes short work of every robot and rival his enemies throw at him. Many speedy characters are glaringly fragile as a result of their speed and agility, but Sonic is as tough and strong as he is fast.





 9  Minato Namikaze 
Naruto
        

Speed is essential to being a great shinobi. While his son Naruto eventually becomes the fastest ninja alive, it’s Minato who always had a reputation for it. Known as the Leaf Village’s Yellow Flash, he was so feared by enemy forces in his prime that flee-on-sight orders were issued for when he came on the scene.
In flashbacks and when he is resurrected by Edo Tensei, Minato proves that he more than lives up to his nickname. His Flying Thunder God technique, invented by Tobirama Senju and perfected by Minato, is more of a teleportation jutsu than one enhancing the actual speed of his body. However, the effect is the same, with Minato’s opponents horrified to see him appear out of nowhere and eliminate entire squadrons in seconds.





 8  Sloth 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
        

Nobody in-universe or out expected Sloth to be the member of Fullmetal Alchemist’s extensive cast to claim the title of “fastest character.” It’s in his name: most of the time, he’s slow and apathetic, barely bothering to even move if he isn’t forced to do something. Then, after centuries of menial labor, he’s presented with a real fight.
Much to the Armstrong siblings’ shock, Sloth might be lazy, but he isn’t weak: he’s just saving energy for when he needs it. He moves so fast he can’t be seen, let alone hit, and even then most things can’t harm him anyway. Unlike most other speedsters, Sloth is only able to charge straight forward instead of zoom all over the place: he’s too lazy to practice any type of skill or finesse that would put his speed to truly effective use.





 7  Killua Zoldyck 
Hunter X Hunter


Despite being as quick as a wild animal himself, Gon focuses much of his training on getting stronger. Being a former assassin, Killua is plenty strong, but it’s his speed that’s truly impressive. Even in the early seasons, his ability to dart around without detection and deliver lethal attacks before anyone can see him, let alone react, terrifies fighters with decades of experience on him.
Killua’s most powerful Nen technique, Godspeed, naturally increases his speed exponentially. It incorporates lightning into his whole body, allowing him to sprint tirelessly for long distances and increasing his reflexes in battle. Though it drains him considerably, the techniques Godspeed unlocks are excellent for both attack and escape.





 6  Notorious B.I.G. 
JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure
        

While fans of JoJo may argue that Jotaro or Dio&#39;s time-stopping abilities make them faster, it&#39;s easy to be quick while no one else around you is moving. The actual fastest creature in the entire weird world of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure can’t even appreciate how impressive it is. Unfortunately for everyone around it, the autonomous Stand Notorious B.I.G. has only two things in its mind: pouncing and eating. Trapped on a plane with the thing, Team Bucciarati can’t make any sudden moves to attract it: they won’t be able to dodge if it attacks.
Being born after its user&#39;s death, Notorious B.I.G. is so overpowered that the heroes can’t even destroy it. While Notorious B.I.G is blind, it can detect movement around itself, and then it automatically attacks the fastest moving object within its range. After detecting the object moving the fastest, it accelerates itself to whatever speeds it needs to catch its target, even becoming fast enough to catch up with a plane flying at 800 kph.





 5  Regieleki 
Pokémon
        

In Pokémon competitions from battles to contests, Speed is one of the six essential stats a Trainer hones in their team. A Trainer building a team focused on speed has hundreds of Pokémon to choose from, but if they want the best of the best, there’s only one real choice. With a base speed of 200, Regieleki the Electron Pokémon is the fastest Pokémon ever.
Regieleki more than earns its place among the legendary Regi group. Made of pure electric energy, its speed far outstrips its other stats and allows it to attack first and dodge anything thrown at it in turn. It’s a testament to Goh’s skill as a Trainer that they’re able to catch one.





 4  Hawks 
My Hero Academia
        

There’s considerable competition in the race to be the fastest hero in the world, from Ingenium (whichever Iida brother has donned the helm) to Deku, who at 100% power is one of the fastest heroes in the world. However, the Number Two Pro Hero handily wins all on his own. A hero with a past more tragic than any villain, Hawks was a child prodigy snatched up by the Hero Public Safety Commission the instant they saw how quickly he worked, and he only ever improved with training.
Like his namesake, Hawks soars and dives through the sky at incredible speeds. And he doesn’t just fly fast; he can launch each sharp feather at blinding speed wherever he wants. He even describes himself as too fast for his own good: in his world, somebody like him could only ever have been an endlessly toiling hero, never resting in his duty.





 3  Speed Racer 
Speed Racer
        

Speed isn&#39;t very fast on foot, but as the theme song says, he’s a demon on wheels. Driving the Mach 5, the top-of-the-line race car crafted by his father, he dominates the global racing scene and is famed as one of the greatest drivers in the world at only eighteen.
In comparison to his kinder manga counterpart and his justice-driven film counterpart, anime Speed Racer is driven to win to almost alarming levels. Not even threats to his life or loved ones — in a world where countless people meet horrible ends on the racetrack — can keep him out of the driver’s seat, and when he’s attacked or sabotaged he’s just as quick to shoot back. Due to the extremely rushed English dub, he talks almost as fast as he drives.





 2  Korosensei 
Assassination Classroom
        

Korosensei’s nigh-invincibility is only half of the challenge of killing him. The budding assassins in his class are supplied with plenty of Anti-Sensei blades and bullets; the hard part is getting fast enough to actually connect with his body. Every day, he dodges and parries relentless assassination attempts without missing a beat in the lessons he’s giving, often moving fast enough to help multiple students at once.
Shady experiments boosted Korosensei’s already legendary skills to superhuman levels. He now moves at Mach 20, about five times faster than a speeding bullet. Luckily for Class 3-E, their teacher is just as ready to jump in front of the attacks of anyone threatening his beloved students as he is to dodge their attacks on him.





 1  Speed O’ Sound Sonic (No, Really, It&#39;s Saitama) 
One Punch Man
        

This deadly ninja is so proud of his speed that he chose a villain name only to brag about it. Sonic does in fact live up to his name, rushing at his enemies so far he’s just a dark blur. As a ninja assassin, he is fast enough to take out his targets and any heroes with the nerve to try and stop him.
Almost any heroes, that is. Saitama isn’t fazed one bit by all of Sonic’s zooming around, and is in fact much faster than him, besides, of course, being impossibly strong. Fuming over Saitama’s complete lack of hoots to give about him, Sonic is determined to defeat him no matter the cost, proving he&#39;s the fastest creature alive.
The fastest characters in anime are often the most fun in the show. Whether they use their talents for competition or for all-out battle, they are always impressive. Willing to put on a show even as they end a bout in the blink of an eye, these fastest anime characters are beloved by fans and a big part of what makes their shows so entertaining.
