  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While shonen romance anime may not be nearly as popular as their shojo counterparts, fans have no excuse to overlook these beautiful love stories.</p>
<p>While the romance genre is typically associated with shōjo titles, fans of love stories looking for new experiences shouldn&rsquo;t ignore the best shōnen romance anime either. As a result of their different target audience and associated anime landscape, these stories often end up approaching the idea of love from new, unexpected angles, while blending this fan-favorite genre with other unexpected genres that range from comedy to horror.
Shōnen romance anime provide a variety of different experiences, some of which are truly heartwarming and uplifting, while others may end on a tragic note. Regardless of how the central relationship develops and what form it finally takes, however, the best romance anime always share one particular attribute, that of featuring interesting and realistic characters that are easy to relate to and fall in love with.</p>
<p>10 Nisekoi: False Love (2014)
Produced by Shaft and based on the manga by Naoshi Komi</p>
<p>Despite being the heir of a powerful yakuza group, Raku Ichijo wants nothing to do with the gang, instead hoping to live a normal high school life. Much to his dismay, to reduce hostility and maintain peace, he is forced into a relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the daughter of a rival gang leader. The two may feel nothing but hatred for each other, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from having to play pretend. Moreover, Raku made a promise to his childhood sweetheart, with nothing but a lock pendant to remember it, and Chitoge seems to hold the key.
Nisekoi: False Love is a romance title that stands out thanks to its execution, more so than its premise. All the tropes typically found in rom-com anime are present here, but they serve only to add to the experience, rather than detract from it, as everything about this title is so innocent and sweet that viewers can&rsquo;t help but fall in love with the characters, even when they&rsquo;re not particularly original. Moreover, perfectly illustrating a classic romance anime trope, this series also features one of the best childhood friend romances.
Although they have not received anime adaptations, Naoshi Komi also authored a number of interesting short stories, ranging from the underrated Koi no Kamisama to the highly appreciated Tokidoki.</p>

<p>9 Tsuredure Children (2017)
Produced by Studio Gokumi and based on the manga by Toshiya Wakabayashi</p>
<p>Youth is often a precious yet difficult time, defined by attempts at self-discovery and struggles with identity and newfound feelings. As one begins to experience feelings of love, perhaps even without fully realizing what exactly it is that seems to mysteriously draw them to someone who had previously been nothing but a friend, or even a stranger, their life becomes that much more confusing. Yet no matter how troublesome it may be, love can&rsquo;t simply be ignored.
Tsuredure Children presents various fragments of multiple high school couples and students struggling with romance. As the episodes are rather short, and the focus constantly switches from one character to another, no one receives the chance to be fully developed or show any signs of meaningful growth, but the depictions of young and inexperienced love, along with all of its inherent highs and lows, make this a perfect title for fans who are already familiar with anime romance stories.

<p>8 The Quintessential Quintuplets (2019)
Produced by Tezuka Productions and based on the manga by Negi Haruba</p>
<p>Fuutarou Uesugi is a brilliant high school student, but his home life leaves much to be desired, as his family struggles with debt. When he receives the offer of tutoring the daughter of a wealthy family, it might seem like the perfect opportunity. Still, he soon learns that he got more than he bargained for, as he is to tutor not one, but five quintuplets, all of whom are equally uninterested in academics and despise the idea of having a tutor, despite the looming threat of failure.
Rom-com anime with harem settings might seem like a dime a dozen, but The Quintessential Quintuplets manages to stand out thanks to its interesting and well-developed characters. Although the girls all have unique personalities, they are not defined by a single attribute, instead being given the chance to show their complex thoughts and lives. Moreover, the male protagonist is also much unlike other typical harem protagonists, as he is neither excessively oblivious nor irrationally appealing to his peers.
Much to fans&rsquo; delight, The Quintessential Quintuplets franchise includes multiple seasons, TV specials, and even a movie, all of which add to the depth of the story and characters.</p>

<p>7 Dusk Maiden of Amnesia (2012)
Produced by SILVER LINK. and based on the manga by Maybe</p>
<p>Seikyou Private Academy has been haunted for 60 years by the ghost of Yuuko, a young girl who tragically and mysteriously died, without even being able to recall the reason for her death, thus proving unable to move on. Now, Yuuko meets Teiichi Niiya, a student who can strangely see her even as no one else can. Recruiting Teiichi and other unsuspecting members to the &ldquo;Paranormal Investigations&rdquo; club, the group begins to investigate the school&rsquo;s legendary mysteries.
Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is a unique title that effortlessly blends two seemingly opposite genres, horror and romance, while also adding a welcome dose of comedy to the mix. Teiichi may only approach Yuuko out of curiosity at first, but the way their relationship develops, as well as witnessing the effect their presence, or lack thereof, has on each other, is simply beautiful. Moreover, as the title follows the unlikely relationship of a human and a ghost, it also makes for one of the best supernatural romance anime.

<p>6 Romantic Killer (2022)
Produced by domerica and based on the manga by Wataru Momose</p>
<p>Anzu Hoshino has only three passions in life - playing video games, eating chocolate, and spending time with her dear pet cat. However, these passions prove to be her weaknesses, when the wizard Riri suddenly shows up before her and announces that she will be denied everything she loves until she finds true love. This marks the beginning of Anzu&rsquo;s new life, transitioning into one found only in otome games, full of potential love interests and planned events meant to expose Anzu to a new world.
Romantic Killer is an entertaining parody title that provides as much joy to romance fans as it does to comedy anime fans. Having a protagonist with no interest in love whatsoever being forced into various situations by a wizard with no understanding of human emotions proves surprisingly fun. Moreover, while the characters do have generic traits, that doesn&rsquo;t stop viewers from finding them easy to appreciate and connect with, making this a charming and captivating experience.</p>

<p>5 TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You (2020)
Produced by Seven Arcs and based on the manga by Kenjirou Hata</p>
<p>Nasa Yuzaki is a determined boy with clear goals, aiming for a renowned high school and a successful life. However, on the day of his entrance exams, he ends up in an unfortunate accident, forcing him to delay his plans. Despite his critical condition, Nasa is saved by Tsukasa, the beautiful girl whose mesmerizing sight blinded him from the oncoming truck in the first place. Convinced that she is his true soulmate, Nasa quickly confesses his feelings, to which Tsukasa responds positively, but adding her own condition - that of marriage.
TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You is a refreshing title whose unique premise allows for previously unexplored ideas to come to life. Contrary to tsundere anime characters, whose hostile facade often prevents them from admitting their true feelings and forming a deep connection, Nasa confesses his admiration immediately, and his relationship with Tsukasa starts with marriage. Yet, despite being married, they are still inexperienced in love, making their story as wholesome as it is enchanting.
Kenjirou Hata, the original creator of TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, also authored Hayate the Combat Butler, a parody title with multiple seasons that blends romance with comedy, while focusing on the latter.</p>

<p>4 Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches (2015)
Produced by LIDENFILMS and based on the manga by Miki Yoshikawa</p>
<p>Ryuu Yamada is a high school student who has no interest in academics, always sleeping in class and getting bad grades. Urara Shiraishi, on the other hand, is one of the school&rsquo;s top students, admired by classmates and teachers alike. When the two accidentally kiss, they learn of their strange ability to switch bodies. Soon, they join the Supernatural Studies Club, seeking to unravel the mystery of the legendary Seven Witches, who are said to have different kiss-activated powers.
While it may be presented as a typical harem anime, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches primarily follows the development of one captivating central relationship, whose growth is surprisingly realistic despite involving the use of magic. Still, the other characters also receive a fair amount of love and attention, proving to be neither forgettable nor one-dimensional, but rather sweet and memorable. This title is as simple as it is endearing, providing an experience that any romance fan is sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>3 The Dangers in My Heart (2023)
Produced by Shin-Ei Animation and based on the manga by Norio Sakurai</p>
<p>Kyoutarou Ichikawa is a gloomy, lonely boy with a penchant for the macabre, secretly dreaming of murdering his classmates. As he gets closer to Anna Yamada, a popular yet absent-minded girl known for her beauty and bright personality, Kyoutarou begins to change as well, moved by Anna&rsquo;s infectious positivity, and drawn to her helpless nature. Rather than seeing her as yet another target to dispose of, he recognizes her as someone to protect and care for.
The Dangers in My Heart is a refreshingly realistic and surprisingly wholesome approach to romance. Its premise might make it seem like more of a comedy title, emphasizing the supposedly murderous nature of Kyoutarou contrasted by Anna&rsquo;s innocence, but that is simply another trope that this series successfully subverts, as it does with gender roles. The central relationship progresses at a realistic pace and does not rely on any worn-out clichés, providing a remarkably wholesome experience.

<p>2 Horimiya (2021)
Produced by CloverWorks and based on the manga by HERO &amp; Daisuke Hagiwara</p>
<p>Hori is a popular girl, whose academic abilities and beauty have earned her everyone&rsquo;s admiration. Meanwhile, Miyamura couldn&rsquo;t be more different, keeping his distance from his classmates and thus being branded as a strange and gloomy boy. Secretly, they are both hiding their real selves from the world, as Hori is a painfully direct and awkward person, while Miyamura has hidden piercings and tattoos. After accidentally having their secrets revealed, the two quickly open up to each other.
Horimiya shines because it excels in the most important department - characters. No matter how a couple comes together or how their story develops, no fan will be able to connect with uninteresting characters. However, Hori and Miyamura are not only refreshingly original and enchanting in and of themselves, but their relationship also allows them to grow further, becoming even more alluring, and providing viewers with a heartwarming experience. Furthermore, the supporting cast is no less charming, further enhancing an already delightful story.

<p>1 Your Lie in April (2014)
Produced by A-1 Pictures and based on the manga by Naoshi Arakawa</p>
<p>Kousei Arima once stood at the peak of the piano world, earning the envy and admiration of all child musicians, and leaving judges in awe of his precision. But along with losing his mother, who also acted as his instructor, he lost the ability to play the piano too, unable to hear his own sound anymore. Years later, a kind, cheerful, and free-spirited girl, Kaori Miyazono, enters his life, reigniting his passion for music.
Your Lie in April is a sincere exploration of the incredible power of love. Kousei falls in love not only with Kaori and her unique musical performances, but also with life itself, as this experience reminds him how beautiful the world can be. This title may infamously tell one of the anime medium&rsquo;s most tragic romance stories, but its inevitable emotional impact does nothing but to prove how viewers always connect with heartfelt stories and complex characters. Beyond its many other strengths, this series can safely be counted among the best shōnen romance anime.
