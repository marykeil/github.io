## Literature Review

A new trailer and visual means the next season of the Blue Exorcist anime is on its way. Here&#39;s what fans can expect to see in The Illuminati Saga. 





Fans have been eagerly anticipating news regarding the future of Blue Exorcist&#39;s anime adaptation for a while especially with the previous reveal of the visual shown below back in December 2022.





 

The new information provides an expected air date for the new season in January 2024 and confirms with its trailer and title what fans can look forward to. Blue Exorcist: Shimane Keimei Society will pick up where the previous season left off and features returning voice actors Nobuhiko Okamoto (Rin Okumura), Jun Fukuyama (Yukio Okumura), Aya Takagaki (Kuro), and more.


 


 The Anticipated Blue Exorcist Illuminati Saga is On Its Way 
          




The previous season saw Rin and his friends traveling to Kyoto in order to assist with stopping the revival of the dreaded Impure King, where they meet Suguro Ryuji&#39;s family and a sect of exorcists called The Myōō Dharani. The Exwires had recently learned of Rin Okumura&#39;s status as Satan&#39;s son and spent the season contending with the reveal while on assignment. However, everyone&#39;s emotions and concerns come to a head when the Right Eye of the Impure King is stolen, becoming a race to control the increasingly treacherous situation of the Impure King&#39;s revival. All the while, Rin learned more about managing his abilities, why he couldn&#39;t unsheathe his sword, and his friends coming to terms with Rin&#39;s origins.

This new season promises to explore more of Kamiki Izumo&#39;s backstory after she is unexpectedly taken by Renzo Shima, under the orders of an organization called The Illuminati. The Illuminati is a powerful organization of individuals who are seeking to blend together the worlds of Assiah, where humans reside, and Gehenna, where demons live. Their recent capture of Izumo reveals that they are intending to transfer the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Fox from her mother&#39;s body to hers, as her mother is declared useless for further experimentation. Rin and his friends struggle their way to Izumo&#39;s side, but when the Illuminati enact this process, Izumo soon finds herself overwhelmed by the Nine-Tailed Fox&#39;s power.




With the new announcement, fans of the original manga can look forward to seeing this story come to life in the upcoming installment of the anime adaptation. The previous season of Blue Exorcist was successful in translating the events of the well-known Kyoto Impure King Arc, so fans are likely to expect the same level of attention dedicated to the latest season and saga of the story.

Blue Exorcist&#39;s Shimane Illuminati Saga will be airing in January 2024.
