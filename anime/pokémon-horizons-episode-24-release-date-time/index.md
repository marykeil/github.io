 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

New episodes of Pokémon Horizons currently only air on the Japanese network TVTokyo, where new episodes air at 6:55 PM JST each Friday. 6:55 PM JST is equivalent to 2:55 AM on the West Coast of the US, and 5:55 AM on the East Coast of the US, making it a rather difficult time to tune in for fans outside Japan. Episodes are also aired in Japanese without subtitles, naturally, so watching the series will require some knowledge of the Japanese language. Pokémon Horizons is confirmed for an English dub set to debut in late 2023, but no more specific date is available at this time.



 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #23? 
          




Episode #23 of Pokémon Horizons revealed that Friede narrowly escaped the collapsing tunnels, and the team regrouped at the local Pokémon Center. They decided to head back in and attempt to deal with the Galarian Moltres, which Dot was able to identify, since it was holding onto one of the Ancient Poké Balls. Moltres was still very aggressive, so Liko faced an uphill battle trying to convince it that they meant no harm. Liko&#39;s pendant once again transformed into the mysterious turtle Pokémon, which showed Moltres the image of the ancient adventurer Lucius, who mentioned something called &#34;Rakua.&#34; That, combined with its fellow Ancient Pokémon Arboliva, finally convinced it to return to its Poké Ball--leaving Liko in possession of a Legendary Pokémon.

Ever since leaving Paldea, the Rising Volt Tacklers&#39; goal has been to find Liko&#39;s grandmother, and it seems that episode #24 will finally introduce her. Liko&#39;s pendant was given to her by her grandmother, and Liko&#39;s mother suggested she would know more about it. With the pendant having now, seemingly permanently, taken on the form of the crystal turtle Pokémon, it&#39;s more important than ever that the team find out exactly what this thing is and what all it&#39;s capable of. Hopefully they don&#39;t end up leading Amethio and the Explorers to Liko&#39;s grandmother along the way...

The prospect of finally learning something about this mysterious Pokémon, which has reoccurred in the series since the second episode, is an exciting one for fans, as even its name remains unknown at the moment. Many fans believe it to be related to Terapagos, another crystalline turtle Pokémon from the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC, so information on this Pokémon could provide some tantalizing hints at the DLC&#39;s content as well. Pokémon Horizons now has its first chance to be the face of a new Pokémon, and hopefully it delivers some insight into the mysteries it&#39;s been building up until now.
