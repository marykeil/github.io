## Literature Review

Ash&#39;s Froakie had a special technique that it used with great regularity, but if that technique was in the games, Froakie would be unstoppable.





Froakie&#39;s Frubbles are established to be extremely sticky from Froakie&#39;s first appearance, causing any person or Pokémon unfortunate enough to be hit with them to become stuck in one spot, unable to move. The Frubbles are actually the white substance that can be seen around Froakie&#39;s neck area, a part of the Pokémon&#39;s design. However, Ash&#39;s Froakie is apparently able to grab a handful of these Frubbles and throw them at opponents. He first uses this against Team Rocket&#39;s Wobbuffet, which was using the move Mirror Coat to reflect all attacks; however, since Frubbles aren&#39;t a real Pokémon move, Mirror Coat is unable to reflect them, and Wobbuffet is trapped.

 Froakie&#39;s Frubbles Render Opponents Helpless 
          

After seeing how well the Frubbles did against Wobbuffet, Ash made them a regular part of Froakie&#39;s repertoire, using them to later stop a rampaging Garchomp by holding it in place. It continues using Frubbles even after evolving into Frogadier, which still has the same white substance around its neck. Frubbles are also used to create a protective mask to avoid airborne particles such as Poison Powder, to blind opponents, and in training as a way to simulate the Bug-type move Sticky Web. Frubbles are a highly versatile ability, it seems, and often form the basis of Ash&#39;s Froakie strategies.

While the bubbles are mentioned in Froakie&#39;s Pokédex entry in the games, the term &#34;Frubbles&#34; is never used, and it doesn&#39;t appear as a move that can be used in battle, in Froakie&#39;s Pokémon X/Y debut or in later games. This is probably for the best, as Froakie&#39;s Frubbles&#39; ability to completely prevent an enemy Pokémon from moving would be extremely overpowered, removing their capacity to dodge attacks entirely. The Pokédex does, however, state that the bubbles play a role in protecting Froakie from attacks, softening incoming blows, which is yet another handy ability that these Frubbles possess.






 Ash&#39;s Froakie Special Move Foreshadows His Evolution 
          

Aesthetically, the Frubbles make a lot of sense in the anime, as Froakie throws them as if they are ninja shuriken, foreshadowing the Water Shuriken move that Greninja gets when it finally evolves. It also fits in with the kind of tricks that ninjas were known to use, making it very on-brand for the frog ninja Pokémon. While the way Ash uses them might be too powerful for the games, the Frubbles are the perfect tool for the anime, which often has out-of-combat problems that the Frubbles are able to solve. Ash does eventually share the usefulness of Frubbles when Goh later catches his own Froakie, making Frubbles an important tool almost all the way to the end of the Pokémon anime.
