## Literature Review

Evangelion has all kinds of spin-offs, but the most mysterious of them is easily the Anima novels, which are coming Westward as audiobooks.




The light novel continuation series Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima, will be receiving English audiobooks courtesy of Seven Seas Entertainment. Tiffany Grant, better known as the voice actor for Asuka in the original English dub, will be providing narration for the books. The first volume will be arriving on December 14. Anima is one of the more mysterious spin-offs in the Evangelion franchise, which makes it a surprise it will have another resurgence in the West.




While Rebuild of Evangelion is the most well-known alternate take on the story, Anima&#39;s existence has also fascinated fans who know of it. Its mecha designs, character art, and premise of a world that continues past the original TV series and movies are only matched by their obscurity. The audiobooks, however, may grant them a new lease on life, years after the conclusion of their publication.

Seven Seas Entertainment&#39;s synopsis for the novels are as follows:


What if reluctant hero Ikari Shinji had saved the world? Now, at seventeen years old, he is the de facto leader of the EVA team. Under the leadership of Commander Katsuragi Misato, the Evangelion suits have been updated with advanced designs and abilities in preparation for the possible return of the monstrous Angels. Four copies of Ayanami Rei are tasked with operating a global anti-Angel search-and-destroy program. But when one of these clones goes rogue, only Shinji can stop her.





Anima is credited to Ikuto Yamashita, the mechanical designer involved in every Evangelion release thus far. As the synopsis says, Anima follows an alternative series of events following the End of Evangelion movie, which leaves Nerv intact three years later. The resulting story is much more action-packed, with the older pilots controlling the more advanced Evangelions, courtesy of Yamashita, who provides plenty of art depicting the iconic mecha in more elaborate armor and armed with more unique weaponry. It is, in essence, a more straightforward series than Hideaki Anno&#39;s famous vision, which was more interested in psychology and mental trauma.

While Evangelion has several spin-offs, Anima has been particularly intriguing to fans, providing both art of the older characters and the newer machines, but little in the way of reading the novels. Anima was first serialized in Kadokawa&#39;s Dengeki Hobby Magazine in 2008, making it an odd sibling to Rebuild of Evangelion. For a good decade, all fans could glean from the material were scans from the internet. Kadokawa itself only published the novel&#39;s last volume in 2019, with Seven Seas Entertainment providing translations around the same time. Even then, it seems they aren&#39;t widely known, despite their newfound accessibility.




Getting Tiffany Grant, Asuka&#39;s voice actor, to provide narration for the new audiobooks may be just what Anima needs to remind the fans that it exists. With Rebuild of Evangelion finished, it is the perfect time to see - or listen to - Yamashita&#39;s take on the franchise, which depicts the pilots growing up, and takes greater advantage of underused plot threads like Rei&#39;s clones. Whether one reads the novels or waits for the audiobook that release in a week, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima is a fascinating continuation of the franchise that should be worth checking out after a decade of obscurity.
