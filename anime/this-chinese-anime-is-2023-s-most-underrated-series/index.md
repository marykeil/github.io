# This Chinese Anime Is 2023 s Most Underrated Series


## SUMMARY 



  Guardians of the Universe showcases the excellence of Chinese anime with its stunning animation and vibrant colors.   The series combines standard superhero stories with compelling character development, offering a balance between external threats and internal struggles.   The lack of recognition for Guardians of the Universe highlights the industry&#39;s tendency to focus on Japan, ignoring the quality of anime produced outside of Japan, particularly in China.

## Literature Review

China&#39;s Guardians of the Universe is one of the best anime series that most fans have never heard of from 2023.




As the year winds down and the focus turns to the best anime of the year, one underrated Chinese anime that should be included in the conversation is Guardians of the Universe. On the one hand, it represents everything good about the global anime industry. On the other hand, it reiterates some of the systemic weaknesses that continue to hamper the anime industry&#39;s continued development.




Developed and produced by Perfect World Animation (完美鲲鹏) Studio in Beijing, China, Guardians of the Universe (宇宙护卫队) follows the adventures of Storm the Tiger – team leader and strongman, Rainbow the Rabbit – tech and intel expert, Flash the Monkey – aerial support and comic relief, Meteor the Pig – ops specialist, and Raindrop – AI support, as they navigate a world full of danger and respond to the most dangerous events.

          

The focus of the team&#39;s adventures runs the gamut of typical superhero situations. They are called on to respond to potential macro dangers such as those threatening the Earth and civilization - such as cataclysmic natural disasters. They are also called on to deal with more evil-based situations, such as a villain&#39;s attempt to take over the world. In that sense, though only four members strong, they are their universe&#39;s version of Marvel&#39;s Avengers or DC&#39;s Justice League.

While the series is targeted at tweeners with its sometimes heavy-handed &#34;mission statements&#34; emphasizing such ideals as the value of family, friendship, and teamwork, that does not take away from its excellence as anime, which is achieved on several fronts. First, there&#39;s the animation. There are few anime in 2023 that can beat the visual dazzle level achieved in the Guardians of the Universe. The shots are clean, and the details – such as the flickering of Rainbow&#39;s rabbit fur in the wind, are as near real-life as can be. The series should be in consideration for best anime of the year for just the animation alone. Second, there are the colors which just pop off the screen.




Outside the animation, there&#39;s the more important element of story and character development. While the stories are standard superhero fare, they are told in an interesting manner. That is, they tend to have two &#34;battles&#34; per episode. One involves an outside threat that must be resolved. The other involves an internal problem like a team member&#39;s journey to overcome a personal issue that is hampering their ability to be effective or tensions between team members. Winning in one battle naturally led to success in the other. The missions not only illustrate how the team works together but also serve as a platform to explain the background and powers of each character.

 The Lack Of Recognition For Guardians Of The Universe Reveals A Weakness In The Industry 
          




The excellence of Guardian of the Universe is a testament to how far the global anime community has grown, developed, and diversified. Less than a decade ago, China was not considered an anime powerhouse – but today, it should be. Quality anime is being made all over the world. However, the lack of recognition that Guardian of the Universe has received is all illustrative of the fact that the industry focuses on Japan more often than not, and ignores or shuns great anime made outside of Japan. This is especially the case with China. China&#39;s domestic anime industry rivals that of Japan&#39;s very own. Hopefully, for anime fans, there will come a time when access to well-made anime like Guardians of the Universe will be just as easy as watching One Piece or Jujutsu Kaisen is now.
