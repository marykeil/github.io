<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While not everyone in Jujutsu Kaisen cursed energy, the strongest characters have dangerous techniques and high levels of cursed energy.</p>
<p>More so than most other shonen series, Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s most powerful characters are a diverse bunch. Cursed-energy sorcerers, cursed spirits, and people without special abilities can all go head-to-head without anyone group inherently having a significant advantage over the other. This is part of what makes the series so interesting as the diverse group of Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s strongest characters make fights a test of will and smarts as much as raw strength.</p>
<p>20  Maki Zenin</p>
<p>Maki Zenin has been an outcast from her own clan as she was born as a non-sorcerer. Despite that, Maki trained hard in order to prove to her family that she can expertly wield her incredible physical prowess, so much so that she can face off against high-grade sorcerers. It would be a grave mistake to undermine Maki’s non-sorcerer status as her strength and fighting capability is made so much more powerful by the cursed weapons she uses. In fact, she was even able to thwart the powerful cursed spirit Hanami, who has well held his own against other jujutsu sorcerers.</p>
<p>19  Noritoshi Kamo</p>
<p>One of the students that the Jujutsu High students faced during the Kyoto Goodwill Events is Noritoshi Kamo. A member of the Kamo clan, Noritoshi has a special cursed technique that allows him to fully manipulate and control his blood.
He can coat the head of arrows in his own blood in order to precisely aim at a target. He can also compress and condense his blood at will, turning it into various offensive objects such as sharp projectiles and wide nets. In a nutshell, Noritoshi’s technique is blood-curdling, and he’s a formidable sorcerer that will give one hell of a battle.</p>
<p>18  Mechamaru</p>
<p>Born with a Heavenly Restriction that greatly limits his physical capabilities, Kokichi Muta has created a cursed corpse so that he can also attend Jujutsu High. His proxy is called Ultimate Mechamaru and is brought to life using Kokichi’s puppet manipulation jujutsu technique.
As Ultimate Mechamaru, Kokichi can produce incredibly powerful offensive skills. This includes shooting energy beams, using arms as blades, and producing a cannon barrel from the inside of his mouth. Kokichi hasn’t shown his full potential as Ultimate Mechamaru in the anime yet, although fans can’t wait to see more of him as they’d like to know more about Kokichi’s confusing but powerful cursed technique.</p>
<p>17  Panda</p>
<p>Another supporting character in Jujutsu Kaisen that has thoroughly confused viewers is Panda. While he may look like a full-grown panda, Panda is actually a cursed corpse created by the school’s principal Masamichi Yaga.
He also attends Jujutsu High and is currently categorized as a grade 2 sorcerer. Because of his innate affinity for jujutsu, Panda can also exorcise curses and has an extremely durable body. He can also switch cores that allow him to harness powerful jujutsu techniques based on other animals like gorilla, triceratops, and rhino. This makes him a terrifying enemy to face on the battlefield.</p>
<p>16  Toge Inumaki</p>
<p>In the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, some sorcerers are handed down special abilities that only exist within their clan. An example of this is the Inumaki clan’s cursed speech technique, which has been exhibited by the semi-grade 1 sorcerer Toge Inumaki.
All sorcerers fear Toge’s cursed speech technique as it allows him to command people around him and obey him. He can even use devices such as cellphones and megaphones to widen his skill’s coverage. However, the commands do take a toll on Toge’s physique, especially if it’s somewhat difficult and demanding. Because of his air of mystique and silent charm, Toge is one of Jujutsu Kaisen’s most loved characters.</p>
<p>15  Nobara Kugisaki</p>
<p>What makes Nobara so powerful is not necessarily her technique, but her fearlessness in battle. She is always calm under pressure, and never allows herself to panic or slip into despair. During the Goodwill event, she handily defeated the grade 2 sorcerer, Momo Nishimiya, despite only being ranked as a grade 3 sorcerer at the time.
Later, when she and Yuji fought Kechizu and Eso, Nobara managed to keep her cool, even when she was poisoned by their Rot Technique: Decay. Nobara&rsquo;s Straw Doll Technique has the potential to flip any fight in her favor, and she is dangerous not only at close distance but also at long range. Her power level is worthy of a grade 1 sorcerer, and she certainly has more room to grow.</p>
<p>14  Megumi Fushiguro</p>
<p>Megumi inherited the rare and powerful Ten Shadows Technique from the Zenin family, which on its own makes him a powerful soldier. In addition to his natural talent, Megumi is also a skilled martial artist who can hold his own in a straight-up brawl. His greatest weakness has been his lack of drive and creativity, something that Satoru has often criticized him for during their training sessions.
Once Megumi lets go of his mental restraints, he becomes a truly powerful sorcerer. In his fight against the Finger Bearer under Yasohachi Bridge, Megumi was able to unleash his Domain Expansion: Shadow Garden for the first time, even though he was heavily damaged and defeated a powerful Curse that should have been way above his level.</p>
<p>13  Yuji Itadori</p>
<p>Prior to becoming Sukuna&rsquo;s vessel, Yuji was already a physical freak of nature. Yuji has a brave heart and is naturally strong, agile, and fast, as seen by his ability to fight a high-level Curse in the first episode, despite not having any cursed energy at the time. After he learns to harness cursed energy after training with Satoru, Yuji&rsquo;s power level increases even further.
His Divergent Fist Technique packs a serious punch, but his ultimate technique is Black Flash. Black Flash is 2.5 times more powerful than a normal hit and capable of damaging even innately powerful special grade curses, like Hanami. Currently, Yuji cannot use Black Flash at will, but if he learns how to do so, his power ceiling is immeasurable.</p>
<p>12  Aoi Todo</p>
<p>Based on his physical figure alone, it&rsquo;s obvious that Aoi is fantastically strong. His muscles are covered in muscles, and with a single punch, he sent Yuji flying dozens of feet and through a fully-grown tree. He admits that he managed to defeat five grade 1 Curses and one special grade Curse during a single night, yet he is not overly confident or cocky.
Aoi is not only physically strong but also incredibly intelligent, and he is able to analyze and predict his opponent&rsquo;s moves within seconds. While his Boogie Woogie technique does not have any innate offensive or defensive capabilities, his skill allows him to use the technique to completely take over a battle and use the environment to his advantage.</p>
<p>11  Yoshinobu Gakuganji</p>
<p>The principal of Jujutsu High hasn&rsquo;t had too many opportunities to show his true power, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not one of Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s strongest characters. A fun twist on the classic old man character archetype popularized by characters like Master Roshi, the Third Hokage, and Chairman Netero, Gakuganji&rsquo;s special ability is to amplify sound through his electric guitar. Decked out in a metal shirt, Gakuganji&rsquo;s shredding can absolutely obliterate cursed spirits, making the principal of Jujutsu High a dangerous threat.</p>
<p>10  Kento Nanami</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to look at Kento and assume that he is just a mild-mannered salaryman, but looks can be deceiving. Behind his neat appearance and monotone voice is a cold-blooded fighter with years of experience underneath his belt. He has great control over his cursed energy, and his two Binding Vows, Overtime and Revealing One&rsquo;s Hand, allow him to access even more power, so much that he is able to coat his entire body in cursed energy.
Before Yuji, Kento held the record for the most consecutive uses of Black Flash, but that is not even his go-to technique. His Ratio Technique is his signature move and allows him to exploit a weak point anywhere he chooses on his opponent&rsquo;s body. With so many tricks up his sleeve, Kento is a truly powerful sorcerer.</p>
<p>9  Choso</p>
<p>One of the few Special Grade curses, Choso more than earns it with his power and capability in combat. More than almost any other fighter in Jujutsu Kaisen, Choso&rsquo;s real strength lies in his intelligence. Able to predict attacks and adjust on the fly, it can be difficult to even get a hit in on him as he tends to be a few steps ahead of his opponents. Even if he is hit though, Choso&rsquo;s control over blood and his body make him an opponent who can easily go toe-to-toe with foes who should theoretically be much stronger than he is.</p>
<p>8  Hanami</p>
<p>Even though Hanami does not possess as much cursed energy as Jogo or Mahito, Satoru claims Hanami is the more threatening Curse. Hanami is unbelievably durable and able to brush off most attacks from weapons and techniques with ease. Additionally, Hanami&rsquo;s ability to suck the lifeforce from the surrounding environment means she can sustain damage that would disable most sorcerers or Curses.
On several occasions, Hanami has taken Satoru by surprise, indicating that she is able to mask her presence. Also, Hanami&rsquo;s Disaster Plants Technique is amazingly versatile and can be used to alter the environment, distract and weaken opponents, and boost her movement speed.</p>
<p>7  Mahito</p>
<p>Although Mahito is a relatively young Curse, he is already terrifyingly powerful. In addition to being quick on his feet, he is also exceedingly cunning and creative. He managed to get the better of Kento during their one-on-one duel in the sewers, and he likely would have defeated Yuji and Kento during their later fight, if not for the intervention of Sukuna.
His Idle Transfiguration Technique gives him the ability to reshape souls. In addition to being hideous, it&rsquo;s also extremely powerful and has limitless possibilities, as he can use it to reshape his body at will, heal himself, or disfigure his opponents. While he has yet to master his Domain Expansion: Self-Embodiment of Perfection, once he does, he will become even more dangerous.</p>
<p>6  Jogo</p>
<p>Despite not being able to defeat Satoru, Jogo is no slouch. He possesses as much cursed energy as eight to nine of Sukuna&rsquo;s fingers, which alone makes him an incredibly powerful Curse. Jogo has an arsenal of fire and lava attacks at his disposal that are capable of incinerating people within seconds.
His Disaster Flames Technique creates small volcanoes that erupt and destroy anything they touch, while his Ember Insects grant him the ability to attack his opponent accurately from long range. Any average sorcerer trapped inside his Domain Expansion: Coffin of the Iron Mountain would be instantly engulfed in flames, and while it didn&rsquo;t work on Satoru, Jogo should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>5  Suguru Geto</p>
<p>A former hero turned villain, Geto is one of four special-grade sorcerers recognized by Jujutsu High. The former hero&rsquo;s true claim to fame is his unreasonable reserve of cursed energy which lets him manipulate and control thousands of powerful cursed spirits without much effort. Geto can than combine those curses into the unreasonably powerful Maximum Uzumaki attack. Even if he didn&rsquo;t have an abundant supply of cursed energy, Geto&rsquo;s mastery of hand-to-hand combat puts him among Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s strongest martial artists. It&rsquo;s a testament to the absurd power levels reached by some of Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s strongest characters that Geto isn&rsquo;t the series&rsquo; most powerful character.</p>
<p>4  Toji Fushiguro</p>
<p>One of the few non-curse users among Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s strongest characters, Megumi&rsquo;s father is an absolutely monstrous fighter who should not be underestimated. Taking on a jujutsu sorcerer like Geto and winning without much hassle is a tall order. Effortlessly beating Gojo should basically be impossible. What makes Fushiguro so intimidating is his raw strength and his in-depth knowledge of the sorcerer community. His bloodlust and ability to take on even the strongest sorcerers rightly earned him the title Sorcerer Killer. Though a handful of sorcerers have surpassed Toji since his time, in his prime, he was close to unstoppable.</p>
<p>3  Yuta Okkotsu</p>
<p>The hero of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Yuta Okkotsu might be young, but he easily earns a high rank among Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s strongest characters. His initial strength comes from the raw power of the cursed spirit of his dead best friend, Rika, who jealously watches over him. Though he isn&rsquo;t sure how to control Rika&rsquo;s power at first, once the two get in synch, they&rsquo;re strong enough to take on and beat the special-grade sorcerer Geto. Though fans of the anime haven&rsquo;t seen much of Yuta since he went on a training mission at the end of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, his return could very well herald the next sorcerer on Gojo&rsquo;s level.</p>
<p>2  Ryōmen Sukuna</p>
<p>The undisputed King of Curses, Sukuna is so powerful that a single one of his fingers is enough to create a special grade Curse. He easily defeated the Finger Bearer in the juvenile detention center, and can literally tear opponents apart with his Dismantle Technique, such as when he slashed Mahito after the Curse tried too many times to touch Sukuna&rsquo;s soul.
His Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine, allows him to attack anything within 200 meters at will, and if that&rsquo;s not enough, he is incredibly cunning and patient. Sukuna is willing to wait for the perfect chance to strike, and once he does, he hardly ever misses.</p>
<p>1  Satoru Gojo</p>
<p>Satoru believes he is the strongest person in existence, and he is most likely correct. He confidently states that he could defeat Sukuna even if he regained all his fingers, and that is not just an empty boast. He has an immense amount of cursed energy, and never seems to get tired. His Limitless Technique is completely overpowered, as it not only allows him to essentially avoid all damage, but also allows him to create powerful singularities that can destroy anything they touch.
During his fight with Jogo, Satoru never once seemed concerned and ended the fight with ease after trapping Jogo in his Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void. Later, he almost killed Hanami with his Limitless: Hollow Purple Technique, and likely would have killed the Curse if he had landed a direct hit. Satoru is easily the most powerful character in the series, and arguably one of the strongest in any anime.
Part of Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s appeal is its focus on incredibly powerful characters. Watching powerful heroes like Yuta battle powerful villains like Geto provides a thrill that&rsquo;s difficult to match. What makes the series&rsquo; powerful cast even more impressive is how varied it is. Even a non-cursed user like Toji Fushiguro can be a major threat to characters who should be more powerful than him. Jujutsu Kaisen&rsquo;s most powerful characters are all part of what makes the series so interesting.</p>
