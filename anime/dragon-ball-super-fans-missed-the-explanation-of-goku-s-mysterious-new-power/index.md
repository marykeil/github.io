# Dragon Ball Super Fans Missed The Explanation Of Goku s Mysterious New Power


## SUMMARY 



  Goku&#39;s latest power-up in Dragon Ball Super surpasses Ultra Instinct and takes the form of a giant Goku-shaped aura avatar.   The Granolah arc&#39;s antagonist, Gas, has a power that allows him to materialize physical limbs and weapons, shedding light on Goku&#39;s newfound form.   Goku&#39;s True Ultra Instinct form allows him to manifest energy outside of his body, similar to the Uchiha clan&#39;s Susanoo technique in Naruto.

## Literature Review

The Dragon Ball Super manga has given Goku a massive power-up that surpasses Ultra Instinct and the limitations of the Saiyan&#39;s physical body.




Goku&#39;s most recent Dragon Ball Super power-up surpasses Ultra Instinct, yet many readers still don&#39;t understand the Saiyan&#39;s &#34;Susanoo-like&#34; form. Throughout Dragon Ball Super&#39;s storyline, Goku and Vegeta have unlocked new powerful forms that have helped them contend with beings as strong as the Gods of Destruction. The two Saiyans continued that trend in the manga&#39;s two post-anime arcs, including Goku&#39;s further evolution of Ultra Instinct, which has puzzled fans with its giant avatar ability.




During the Galactic Patrol Prisoner arc, Goku received special training from a trainee angel who happened to be the Galactic Patrol&#39;s strongest member. The fruits of that training presented themselves during the epic final battle against Planet-Eater Moro, which saw Goku attain a Perfected Ultra Instinct form that manifested a giant Goku-shaped aura avatar. 

          

The ability would appear again in the following story, the Granolah the Survivor Arc, except Goku isn&#39;t the only fighter to unlock such a technique. A wish granted to make the Granolah arc&#39;s antagonist, Gas of the Heeter family, the strongest in Dragon Ball&#39;s universe, gave the fighting prodigy incredible levels of strength. However, in chapter #86, Gas&#39;s immense energy materialized physical limbs beyond his body and helped shed some light on Goku&#39;s newfound form.





 Gas&#39;s Powers Help Explain Goku&#39;s Ultra Instinct Form 
          

During the battle, Gas was able to materialize his own weapons out of thin air and even create large ethereal limbs that caused significant damage to Goku. &#34;My power has been liberated from my flesh,&#34; gloated Gas as he pummeled Goku to the point of unconsciousness in chapter #86 of the manga. While Gas was only able to manifest fists and feet, it&#39;s possible to make a connection with Goku&#39;s Perfected Ultra Instinct form that has been able to replicate the Saiyan&#39;s entire body in energy form.

It seems that once a warrior reaches the supreme stage of their growth, their “power”, intended as their energy or ki, is no longer confined inside their body (from where it can only be discharged through explosive blasts) but is free to materialize and move. Gas used it after becoming the &#34;strongest in the universe&#34;, while Goku did it in two instances where he reached his maximum growth (at the time). Against Moro, Goku used Perfected Ultra Instinct like he was never able to do before, boosted by Uub’s divine ki. Against Gas, Goku had just achieved True Ultra Instinct, where he gets in touch with his “true self” and unleashes the true form of his power. In fact, before using the full energy avatar, Goku shows he can project energy from his leg in the form of an explosive kick too.






 Goku&#39;s Trained Ultra Instinct To Surpass His Body&#39;s Physical Limitations 
          

Like the Naruto series&#39; Uchiha clan Susanoo technique, Goku&#39;s manifestation of energy can now take form outside the confines of his body. The form&#39;s incredible power and defense proved vital in saving the day on the two occasions it manifested against Moro and Gas. This unusual power puzzled fans, but the series already gave it an explanation through Gas&#39; abilities. Fans are eager to see more of Goku&#39;s new Ultra Instinct power, but they will probably have to wait for the next, much-anticipated arc of the Dragon Ball Super manga.

Dragon Ball Super is available from Viz Media and Manga Plus.
