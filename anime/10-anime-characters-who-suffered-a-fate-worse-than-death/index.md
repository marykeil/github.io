## Literature Review

While death is never desired, it is certainly preferable to what these characters experience, as their punishments extend far beyond a quick demise.




Whether deserved or otherwise, it is not uncommon for anime characters to experience tragic events or suffer cruel deaths, either as a form of retribution or simply to establish their backstories. However, in a medium as creative as this, the worst possible punishment is seldom limited to simply dying. Instead, the anime characters who suffer a fate worse than death have to experience more unorthodox and horrific situations.
While death is seldom desired, its one redeeming aspect is that it&#39;s quick and definitive, which is exactly what separates it from these fates. Rather than being granted a proper ending, these characters are typically forced to experience repeated, sometimes even eternal, punishments, that range from reliving their moment of death to being forced to cause and witness the end of many others&#39; lives. Some end up in this situation as a result of their own malicious acts, while others are simply born unlucky.









 








 10  Rika Furude (Higurashi: When They Cry) 
Produced by Studio Deen and Based on the Visual Novel by 07th Expansion


 







Initially, Higurashi: When They Cry is presented as a story about protagonist Keiichi Maebara moving to the idyllic village of Hinamizawa and exploring it with his newfound friends and schoolmates, a group of cheerful local girls. However, upon learning about a series of murders that seem to be connected to the village&#39;s mysterious annual festival, the story shifts drastically, with Rika Furude taking the spotlight instead. It is eventually revealed that Rika has lived through multiple parallel words, experiencing various traumatic memories and brutal deaths and retaining her memories of each, seemingly fated to die tragically no matter what. Moreover, her death always triggers the aptly named Great Hinamizawa Disaster.

Elder Toguro is one such corrupted and sadistic demon, who Team Urameshi fights during the Dark Tournament arc. After finally defeating him, Kurama, an ally of Yusuke, decides not to kill Toguro due to his regenerative powers. Instead, Kurama uses the Sinning Tree to keep Toguro in constant, eternal pain, hallucinating about his worst nightmares.
