## Literature Review

Even before Ghibli, the Castle of Cagliostro has gone down as a masterpiece and helped to establish Hayao Miyazaki as an icon of anime.





Lupin III is one of the longest-running and most consistently popular anime and manga franchises in Japan. Originating in 1967 with the manga by artist Monkey Punch, the franchise has grown to include eight anime series, 11 theatrical films, a TV special every year from 1989-2013, plus several more since then, and all of the merchandise that comes with a franchise that has been popular for almost 60 years. The Castle of Cagliostro is the second full-length Lupin III movie, but has become the best-known in the franchise and helped to shape the later tone of the franchise and its characters.





 Miyazaki&#39;s Lupin III Castle of Cagliostro is a Classic 
          

The eponymous character, Arsène Lupin III, is the grandson of the literary master thief of Pulp magazines Arsène Lupin, the same character that inspired both the protagonist&#39;s persona in Persona 5 and the live-action Netflix show Lupin. Like his grandfather, Lupin III is a gentleman thief, though in the original manga, he&#39;s much more cold-hearted and amoral. The Castle of Cagliostro played a major role in softening his image and establishing him as a charming scoundrel rather than a cold-hearted criminal. In fact, this marked change in the tone of the original manga is part of the reason The Castle of Cagliostro was not initially popular in Japan. Fittingly for a story about a master thief, the movie begins with a heist.

Upon discovering that the money they&#39;ve stolen from a casino is counterfeit, Lupin and his triggerman Jigen follow the counterfeit cash to its source in the Grand Duchy of Cagliostro. Along the way, they encounter Princess Clarisse, fleeing from the Count&#39;s attempts to force her to marry him to reunite and two branches of the royal family of Cagliostro and unlock the secret of Duchy&#39;s ancient treasure. Lupin&#39;s heist changes from trying to steal the Count&#39;s wealth to trying to rescue Princess Clarisse. Meanwhile, the other recurring Lupin III characters get involved with their own competing schemes: Lupin&#39;s associate the master samurai Goemon, INTERPOL agent Zenigata, wildcard femme fatale Fujiko. All these schemes and counter-schemes culminate in a showdown between Lupin and the Count on the moving hands of the castle&#39;s clock tower.






 All of Miyazaki&#39;s Trademarks in in Castle of Cagliostro 
          

There&#39;s a longstanding rumor that Steven Spielberg was inspired by the chase scenes in The Castle of Cagliostro. The truth of these rumors is unclear, though the climactic clock tower scene has received obvious homages from later animated films, so its influence, in general, is undeniable, even if the rumors about Spielberg are just a myth. Despite the initially lukewarm reaction, the sheer mastery of the medium on display in The Castle of Cagliostro slowly but surely won over audiences in Japan, earning The Castle of Cagliostro its rightful place as an anime masterpiece. All of the later Ghibli hallmarks are present. Most importantly, for a movie that&#39;s almost 60 years old, the animation still looks phenomenal. The Castle of Cagliostro stands as one of the most impressive directorial debuts of all time.




While the future of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s directorial career remains unclear at this point, he has cemented his status as an icon. Even before the establishment of Studio Ghibli and Ghibli&#39;s run of masterpieces, he was establishing himself as one of the greatest of all time from the very beginning with The Castle of Cagliostro. Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s legendary career that began with The Castle of Cagliostro has spanned decades to continue with The Boy and the Heron.
