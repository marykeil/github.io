## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen used an innovative technique to double the amount of hype moments in its latest season, which may influence Shonen anime in the future.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2!




There are plenty of insanely hype moments in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident arc that fans were eagerly looking forward to, but the anime surpassed expectations, giving these fans more than they could have hoped for. This falls in line with the general standard of quality that Studio MAPPA has introduced to the show in the second season. This may set a new standard for other adaptations of Shonen arcs.

The first hint of this was the beginning of Season 2&#39;s seventh episode, which shows Mechamaru&#39;s giant robot break through the ground and surprise Mahito. This same scene was shown at the ending of the sixth episode, but instead of just completely reusing the animation for it, MAPPA actually reanimated it, showing it from a different perspective. 

          




This was the second time MAPPA has done this, having previous shown Riko&#39;s tragic murder at the hands of Toji from two different angles, but this was the first time it did this in the Shibuya Incident Arc. This became a continuing trend in the Shibuya Incident arc, which similarly presented many of the hype moments in that storyline in two different ways.


 Jujutsu Kaisen Repeated Its Best Moments In The Best Way 
          

This is incredibly innovative, especially given how other anime often handle scenes like this. Often in order to save time and money, an anime will repeat the same scene exactly as it was animated at the start of a new episode. This also has the added benefit of helping to orient the viewers to what is happening in the show, as many may have forgotten in the week-long break between episodes. However, if a show relies too much on this crutch and other reused footage, it can run into pacing issues or make its fans bored. The One Piece anime is a perfect example of this, as even with the hype debut of Luffy&#39;s Gear 5, the show&#39;s repetition of footage has diminished its hype a little.




The way MAPPA dealt with this issue gives Jujutsu Kaisen fans the best of both worlds. They can both be reminded about the latest hype moments that have happened in the series if they somehow forgot, and they can also still be entertained by it if they remember it as they&#39;ll get to see it in a different way. This technique also takes advantage of a quirk unique to television shows. With a weekly manga series, there isn&#39;t enough space to actually show audiences what happened at the end of the previous chapter, and even if there was, many fans would view it as a waste of time given how quick it is to reread part of a prior installment. Television is different, with the episodes generally being longer and harder to isolate individual scenes from. This lets MAPPA use its medium to arguably improve its source material once again.



 Hopefully Jujutsu Kaisen Influences Other Anime Repetition As Well 
          




With the popularity of the Shibuya Incident Arc, it will likely influence a lot of future Shonen series. Part of this influence may extend beyond the specific plot of the arc and instead concern the way the anime adapted it. This would potentially cause Jujutsu Kaisen to change the way anime use repetition in the future.
