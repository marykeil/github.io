## Literature Review

While they may not have solved nearly as many cases as the legendary Conan, these detectives can uncover the truth behind any mystery.





Great detectives are always admired across all media, with notable examples being the timeless Sherlock Holmes, and anime is no different, particularly thanks to the popularity of Case  d&#39;s Conan. Proving themselves to possess deduction and analytical skills far superior to their peers, these characters are shown to be some of the most brilliant detectives the medium has to offer, solving even the toughest cases with ease.









 








 10  Keith Kazama Flick (B: The Beginning) 
        

B: The Beginning&#39;s protagonist Keith Kazama Flick is a legendary investigator affiliated with the Royal Police Service, who aims to uncover the identity of the notorious Killer B. Though he retired from being an investigator when his sister was murdered, suffering profound trauma as a result, he ended up taking the case at the behest of an old friend. His appearance and behavior often cause people to assume he is lazy, but the truth is that he is a genius when it comes to math and calculations, using his knowledge to accurately predict his target&#39;s next moves, and then acting accordingly to ensure he has the upper hand.





 9  Akihito Narihisago (Id:Invaded) 
        

The events of Id:Invaded take place in a world where something known as the Mizuhanome System exists, allowing people to explore human minds by entering abstract psychological planes that depict their unconscious thoughts. However, only those who have killed others are able to enter these id wells. Akihito Narihisago is one such detective-turned-criminal, who ended up in police custody after taking revenge on his daughter&#39;s murderer. Still possessing a profound hatred towards serial killers, as well as his remarkable skills and experience as a detective, he now solves murder cases by using the Mizuhanome System and investigating id wells, getting to know criminals better than they know themselves.





 8  Houtarou Oreki (Hyouka) 
        

While not a detective per se, given that Houtarou Oreki is still in school, he could easily become one of the best, should he make up his mind to expend the necessary energy. Hyouka follows Houtarou as he uses his exceptional deduction skills to solve mysteries, prompted by the ever-curious Eru Chitanda, whom he has feelings for. He is generally passive and apathetic, living by the idea that he should only do what is necessary, but whenever Eru comes up to him with something she wants to find out the truth behind, he proves that he is significantly smarter than his grades would have one believe, displaying unexpected skills.





 7  Sakurako Kujou (Beautiful Bones -Sakurako&#39;s Investigation-) 
        

Beautiful Bones -Sakurako&#39;s Investigation-&#39;s titular protagonist is Sakurako Kujou, a trained osteologist with a genuine passion for bones and skeletons. Moreover, she was also mentored by a renowned forensic scientist, further increasing her repertoire of skills. Using her rich knowledge and expertise, she often acts as a forensic consultant for the local prefectural police, assisting them in solving murder cases that would otherwise seem impossible. While the scope of the cases she solves may not be particularly large, Sakurako would certainly be able to figure out any mystery involving bones, as no bone can keep any secrets from her and her investigative skills.





 6  Shinya Kougami (Psycho-Pass) 
        

Initially affiliated with the Public Safety Bureau, working for the Criminal Investigation Department&#39;s Division 01, Shinya Kougami is a brilliant detective who would go to any lengths to uncover the truth behind any mystery, no matter what there is to lose in the process. At first, he is an Inspector, but after one of his colleagues becomes victim to the murderer they were investigating together, Shinya&#39;s feelings intensify and his crime coefficient goes up, after which he is demoted to being an Enforcer. Psycho-Pass&#39; first protagonist combines his knowledge, experience, and instincts with an unparalleled fearlessness, to deal with cases in a way no one else possibly could.

Exclusive: ahead of the long-awaited premiere of PSYCHO-PASS: Providence, Crunchyroll offers fans an exclusive recap video of the entire franchise.








 5  Victorique de Blois (Gosick) 
        

While Gosick&#39;s protagonist, Victorique de Blois, was already born with seemingly superhuman intelligence, her knowledge was further honed during her childhood, as she was forced to live in the dungeon of the de Blois Mansion, constantly reading books that most adults couldn&#39;t even begin to comprehend. She was later sent to Saint Marguerite Academy, where was supposed to remain mostly isolated from her peers. Victorique may just be one of the smartest anime characters ever, shown to not only read and absorb knowledge at tremendous speeds, but also possess unparalleled skills in terms of observation, analysis, investigation, and logic, nearly being able to predict the future perfectly.





 4  Daisuke Kanbe (The Millionaire Detective – Balance: UNLIMITED) 
        

While The Millionaire Detective – Balance: UNLIMITED follows a pair of detectives, Daisuke Kanbe is certainly the more interesting of the two. As the titular millionaire detective, Daisuke seems to hold the belief that everything can and should be solved through money, which, as the scion of a billionaire family, he possesses in abundance. Typically solving mysteries in a somewhat aggressive manner, in ways that involve bribery, cutting-edge technology, and showy connections, he always gets to the bottom of a case, no matter how much money it takes. While his methods may be unconventional and occasionally morally ambiguous, their effectiveness is undeniable, proving that his belief about money is correct.





 3  Shinjuurou Yuuki (Un-Go) 
        

Set in a dystopian future, Un-Go follows Shinjuurou Yuuki and his associate Inga, as they solve various cases together. While Inga also plays a role in pinning down the truth, thanks to their ability to force a subject to truthfully answer a single question, it is Shinjuurou who can investigate the details and find the perfect question to ask. Some people refer to him as &#34;The Defeated Detective&#34;, because he was once proven to incorrectly assess a situation, but he seems to have resolved himself not to repeat that mistake since, as he continues to use his extraordinary intelligence and analytical skills to solve case after case.





 2  Yakumo Saitou (Psychic Detective Yakumo) 
        

Psychic Detective Yakumo&#39;s titular protagonist Yakumo Saitou is a seemingly normal college student who has the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Somehow getting dragged into various cases, he always manages to solve the case before anyone else does, including the police, and not just because of his special ability. He is shown to be not only extremely intelligent, observant, and logical, but also absolutely willing to resort to tricks and traps if they allow him to get what he wants. While being able to see ghosts does occasionally help, it has in fact caused him more hardships than fortune in life, which is why he typically hides his crimson-red eye with colored contacts.





 1  L (Death Note) 
        

Death Note&#39;s L is perhaps the medium&#39;s most famous detective, known for his attempt to discover the identity of the mass murderer known as Kira. Found and taken to an orphanage for gifted children by Watari, who would later become his assistant, L displayed incredible intelligence early on, becoming a reputable detective at a young age. Though his disheveled appearance may cause people to doubt his credibility, he is known as the world&#39;s greatest detective for a reason. His analytical and deductive skills are second to none, and he&#39;s not afraid to lure suspects into a false sense of security to ensure his success, whether that requires deception or subterfuge.
Even though not all of these characters may be proper detectives, with some working as independent consultants and others merely solving mysteries on a whim, prompted by circumstances, they all prove to have the necessary intelligence and deduction skills to excel in the field. Perhaps, if they put their mind to it, they could even solve some of anime&#39;s biggest mysteries. Whether they aim to identify the culprits behind cruel homicidal cases, or simply seek to explore local mysteries, all of these characters are worthy of being known as the best anime detectives ever.
