## Literature Review

Due to the popularity of the isekai theme, many great stories that fall under this category never get the chance to be in the spotlight.





Even beyond the commonly well-liked titles lies a vast trove of diverse stories waiting to be discovered. Some may indeed be uninspired, merely trying to join the trend without adding anything of value, but some take the concept and use it as a way to take their viewers on a genuinely entertaining journey that leverages its premise flawlessly.









 








 10  Farming Life in Another World 
        

After dying of a terminal illness that left him bedridden in the final years of his life, protagonist Hiraku Machio meets a benevolent god who gives him the chance to choose his next reincarnation, to which he expresses his dream of being a farmer. Then, with a healthy body and a magical farming tool that can transform into anything he needs, his Farming Life in Another World ensues. Though there is much he has to learn about his new fantasy world, watching Hiraku&#39;s journey, of turning a plot of land in a dangerous forest into a thriving community full of interesting characters, makes for a truly relaxing and heartwarming experience.





 9  Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion 
        

Most isekai stories revolve around completely unfamiliar fantasy worlds, but some transport their protagonists into existing fictional worlds instead. Unlike other similar titles, the titular Raeliana is neither a heroine nor a villainess, but rather an unimportant supporting character who is fated to die at the hands of her fiancée. Desperate to avoid this tragic ending, the reincarnated protagonist seeks to escape her fate by getting engaged to someone else. As one of the better manhwa adaptations out there, Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion presents a truly refreshing romance story whose intriguing and ingenious characters are sure to appeal to fans of the genre.





 8  Campfire Cooking in Another World With My Absurd Skill 
        

After accidentally being summoned as a hero to a different world, Tsuyoshi Mukouda receives the seemingly useless &#34;Online Grocery&#34; skill. Deemed unfit to be a hero, Tsuyoshi sets out to live a peaceful life, with the help of his unique skill that lets him order modern cooking tools and food from Japan at a cheap price. His cooking skills and access to exotic ingredients even appeal to the mythical wolf Fenrir, who becomes his familiar in exchange for meals. Thanks to its slow pace and charming characters, Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill makes for a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing experience perfect for any food-loving anime fan.





 7  The Vision of Escaflowne 
        

The Vision of Escaflowne follows 15-year-old Hitomi Kanzaki, an ordinary schoolgirl with a penchant for tarot. After unexpectedly meeting a young prince known as Van Fanel and helping him slay a dragon, Hitomi finds herself transported to his world, Gaea, and caught up in his mission to fight against the Zaibach empire. Although the anime adaptation suffered from budget cuts, this isekai show, released long before the isekai trend came about, remains one of the most entertaining and epic sagas out there, combining fantasy and mecha elements to tell an original and captivating story that is sure to leave a lasting impression on viewers.





 6  Parallel World Pharmacy 
        

While isekai shows feature a variety of themes, Parallel World Pharmacy is unique in its focus on the medical field, which remains largely unexplored by the anime industry. The story follows a renowned pharmacologist and medical researcher who, after overworking himself to death, receives a new chance at life in a different world. Reincarnated as Falma de Médicis and armed with vast knowledge as well as divine abilities that let him create and destroy matter, he is determined to continue making medicine and treating people justly, regardless of the social class system in place. From the original premise to the wholesome moments, there is plenty to like about this show.





 5  Kakuriyo: Bed and Breakfast for Spirits 
        

Aoi Tsubaki is a college student who can see dangerous human-eating spirits from the hidden realm. After her grandfather, who raised her, passes away, she is burdened with his debt, which she&#39;s supposed to pay off by marrying Oodanna, the ogre innkeeper. Promptly refusing this idea, she chooses to work at the inn instead, cooking for any spirits who visit. While Kakuriyo: Bed and Breakfast for Spirits might resemble other titles at a glance, it is truly a unique story, that takes great care to accurately depict Japanese culture, including its folklore and traditional foods, with a particular emphasis on the importance of food and the pleasure of cooking for others.





 4  The Twelve Kingdoms 
        

The Twelve Kingdoms follows protagonist Youko Nakajima, a seemingly ordinary student who only stands out due to her unnatural red hair. Her simple life is suddenly interrupted when a mysterious man named Keiki shows up before her at school, swearing allegiance and transporting her and two of her classmates into a parallel world, where immortal, divine beings and fearsome demons exist. Unlike other parallel worlds though, this one is not kind to strangers. Unfortunately, the anime show was cut short, leaving fans wishing for more, but it still remains an impactful and unforgettable experience that has captured many fans&#39; hearts with its intricate, immersive world-building and impressive character development.





 3  Handyman Saitou in Another World 
        

The titular protagonist Saitou is an undervalued handyman whose varied skill set doesn&#39;t get him far in his world. However, when he is hit by a truck and transported into a different world, he finds a party that understands just how valuable he is. Although the powerful warrior, cleric, and mage he teams up with are more than capable in combat, they are in dire need of help when it comes to organization, maintaining items, and picking locks. Handyman Saitou in Another World is a fresh take on the isekai theme, which stands out not only through its protagonist but also through the way it blends comedy scenes with dark moments.





 2  The Magical Revolution Of The Reincarnated Princess And The Genius Young Lady 
        

The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady makes its premise clear from the title, as the story revolves around a reincarnated princess, named Anisphia Wynn Palletia, who, in spite of her noble status and profound admiration for magic, is unable to control magic normally. Instead, with the aid of Euphyllia Magenta, who is blessed by the spirits, she develops a new theory named &#34;magicology&#34; and creates her own form of magic. Featuring a surprising story that subverts genre expectations, one of the best LGBTQ&#43; romances in anime, and a great art style to boot, this show provides a woefully underrated experience.





 1  Sonny Boy 
        

Although it is technically an isekai show, as it features protagonists who are literally sent to different worlds, Sonny Boy shares little in common with the majority of titles that fall under this category. The story follows 36 students who keep drifting between alternate dimensions, each with their own rules. Moreover, some of the students develop strange powers, which lead to new conflicts and rivalries. Featuring a distinctive art style, a large cast of varied relatable characters, and an impactful yet vague story that is largely up to interpretation, Sonny Boy is not only a special isekai story, but also one of the most unique anime titles to date.
From stories that trap their protagonists in familiar fictional worlds, to those that transport them into new fantasy worlds, whether with or without any unique skills, this list proves just how varied the isekai theme can be. Whether one is particularly interested in laid-back, relaxing stories, or instead prefers epic tales with twists and turns, this theme can lend itself to anything. With some isekai anime shows playing into their tropes, and others subverting expectations, there truly is something for everyone, especially when considering the lesser-known titles.
