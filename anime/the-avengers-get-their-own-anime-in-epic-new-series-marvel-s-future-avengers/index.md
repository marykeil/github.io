On Marvel.com, the company announced that Marvel&#39;s Future Avengers has begun airing on its YouTube channel, Marvel HQ. The channel has featured numerous full episodes of various series, including LEGO Marvel Avengers: Climate Conundrum, I am Groot, and Kang vs. the Avengers, among others. Now, Marvel&#39;s Future Avengers will join the channel&#39;s offerings in commemoration of the Avengers&#39; 60th anniversary. A new episode will &#34;air&#34; every Tuesday, which will occur from now through Summer 2024 until all thirty-nine episodes have been uploaded. The series will receive new merchandise beginning this Holiday season and stretching into 2024. This will include apparel, accessories, toys, and home goods, though specific products have not been revealed as of yet.




Marvel&#39;s Future Avengers introduces three new heroes to the Marvel Universe. Thanks to Hydra, all three have superhuman abilities. They begin to use these powers for good after escaping the iconic villain organization and encountering the Avengers. Throughout the series, they battle several classic foes and team-up with a plethora of Marvel heroes, including Green Goblin, Kang the Conqueror, Red Skull, Iron Fist, Deadpool, and Ms. Marvel. The anime also features numerous locations, including Avengers Tower, the Raft, Wakanda, and many others. This new generation of heroes has a bright future ahead of them, particularly with Marvel&#39;s new approach to the team.

The decision to upload Marvel&#39;s Future Avengers to Marvel HQ is one that will get the anime in front of new viewers very easily. While Disney&#43; has many enjoyable Marvel offerings, it is great that some series are having the chance to diverge from the service to be more accessible to audiences. Its main heroes debuted in Marvel Comics, within Future Fight Firsts. The series was produced by Madhouse, Inc. in partnership with Disney Japan. The animation studio is known for One Punch Man (Season 1), Cardcaptor Sakura, Beyblade, and Death Note. The first episode of the anime series, Marvel&#39;s Future Avengers, is currently available to watch on Marvel HQ.
