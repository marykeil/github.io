# Dragon Ball Super 100 Teases Black Frieza s Shocking Real Power Level


## SUMMARY 



  According to the latest issue of V Jump, Black Frieza&#39;s power level approaches that of a God of Destruction, which explains how he was able to humiliate Goku and Vegeta.   Frieza achieved his newfound power by actually training for the first time in his life, using a Room of Spirit and Time.   It is uncertain if Black Frieza is now the strongest person in the universe, but he is definitely closer to a God of Destruction than Goku and Vegeta.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Super teases that the true power of Black Frieza may be even higher than what fans believe after his impressive debut.




Frieza&#39;s return in Dragon Ball Super created a shockwave due to the impressive power displayed by his new Black Frieza form, and now the franchise is teasing that his actual strength may be already near that of a God of Destruction such as Beerus.




In a post to X, formerly Twitter, Dragon Ball news reporter @DbsHype provides a description of Black Frieza that was translated from this month&#39;s V Jump magazine, where Dragon Ball Super is serialized.


 

As the post teases, Black Frieza&#39;s new power level approaches that of a God of Destruction. As some of the mightiest beings in the twelve known universes, the Gods of Destruction can erase lifeforms and planets with the snap of a finger. If Black Frieza possesses just a portion of their powers, this explains how he was able to humiliate both Goku and Vegeta during his last appearance.


 Frieza Followed Goku&#39;s Example To Become The Strongest 
          




Black Frieza first appears in Dragon Ball Super Chapter #87, and to everyone&#39;s surprise, obliterates Gas in one blow. Up until that moment, Gas was clearly the strongest warrior in the universe, even in his decaying state, due to his wish to the Dragon Balls. Frieza had been absent from the story for some time, during which he did something that he never did before: actually train. The Black Frieza form was the fruit of his efforts.

Considering their own inability to take down Gas, Goku and Vegeta were completely dumbfounded by Frieza&#39;s gigantic increase in abilities. Frieza explained that he borrowed a trick from his enemies&#39; book: he found a Room of Spirit and Time and spent the equivalent of ten years training inside that. This is significant because Frieza, as a naturally born genius warrior, never spent a day of his life training before meeting Goku. Even his first power up in Dragon Ball Super, Golden Frieza, was the result of just four months of regular training.



 Black Frieza Might Be The Strongest Person In The Universe 
          




Considering the huge boost that Frieza got in just four months, it was the natural consequence that, if he trained as much as the Saiyans do, he would easily surpass them. However, while it is obvious that Black Frieza was stronger than both Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta, it was impossible to determine just how spowerful he got. Even Whis could not determine if he was now the strongest person in the universe or if there was someone else even stronger.

This little tease from V Jump seems to imply that, at least, Frieza is closer to the level of a God of Destruction than Goku and Vegeta. Considering that it&#39;s plausible that he will be the villain of the long-anticipated new arc of Dragon Ball Super, if Black Frieza is truly close to a God of Destruction like Beerus&#39; level, the training that Goku and Vegeta have been doing to fight him will have to really pay off if the hope to stand a chance.
