## Literature Review

While the hype surrounding Shonen Jumpâ€™s hot new manga Kagurabachi has focused on its likeness to Jujutsu Kaisen, it has a plan to go its own way.





Over the last few weeks, Takeru Hokazono&#39;s Kagurabachi has been the talk of the manga world, and much of the attention has been focused on its plot. The story follows teenager Chihiro Rokuhira and his quest to avenge his master swordsmith father&#39;s murder by a band of mysterious sorcerers known as the Hishaku, who slaughtered him to steal his enchanted swords. The presence of a society of sorcerers has obviously triggered comparisons to Jujutsu Kaisen. Whether purposefully or not, Hokazono has helped facilitate this by including several in-story nods to Gege Akutami&#39;s best-selling manga, such as the use of barrier techniques or Chihiro&#39;s mentor being a wise-cracking, super chill man who physically resembles Satoru Gojo.




                  Kagurabachi Review: Shonen Jump&#39;s Jujutsu Kaisen &amp; Demon Slayer Fusion Is Missing An X Factor   Shonen Jump&#39;s new battle manga feels like a mix of other hit series and will need to prove it has something of its own if it wants to last long-term.   


 Kagurabachi Does Not Need To Hide The Supernatural Like Jujutsu Kaisen Does 
          

Outside all the Jujutsu Kaisen comparison hype, or maybe because of it, Hokazono includes a line in the second chapter that suggests despite the similarities, Kagurabachi will not be just another Jujutsu Kaisen copy, and will instead develop its own memorable storyline and plot that will be just as interesting. Chihiro&#39;s mentor, Mr. Shiba, points out that most sorcerers operate in big cities, meaning that people who live in the countryside are mostly unfamiliar with sorcery. As Jujutsu Kaisen fans will know, almost all the story&#39;s action takes place in Tokyo and Kyoto, the site of the only two Jujutsu Kaisen training academies. Still, the majority of the population of Japan is unaware of the existence of Cursed Spirits and Cursed Energy, and the Jujutsu sorcerers operate like a secret cabal.




So, while Jujutsu Kaisen is built on a common premise that the supernatural elements in the story are unknown or invisible to the majority of people, Kagurabachi takes a different path. The &#34;common&#34; people are indeed aware of the existence of sorcerers, but as these congregate only in big cities, most of the citizens outside of those will never come in contact with the supernatural. This allows the series to develop a different style of worldbuilding, where realism (highlighted by the pseudo-historical setting of early 1900s Japan) coexists with the fantastical or supernatural element.



 Kagurabachi Takes A Different Approach To Realism 
          

More importantly, this framework of parallel coexistence means that when Kagurabachi will show all-out supernatural battles, it won&#39;t have to rely on plot devices such as illusions or barriers to explain how common people go on with their lives while superhuman sorcerers fight next to them. By chapter #3, the action has moved to Tokyo, so this setup will be put to the test. It&#39;s obvious that Kagurabachi is borrowing heavily from famous predecessors such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen, and there is nothing wrong with that, as long as the series continues to show its originality and carve its own path in the shonen manga world.
