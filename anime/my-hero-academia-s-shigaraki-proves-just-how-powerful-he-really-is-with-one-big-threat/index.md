## Literature Review

Shigaraki has already had some incredible displays of power within the series, but his latest threat puts him on a completely different level.





Summary

  Shigaraki&#39;s next target in My Hero Academia is Mt. Fuji, and his power has the potential to cause a catastrophic volcanic eruption.   Destroying Mt. Fuji would have a huge psychological impact, as it is a symbol of Japan and its people.   Despite facing an uphill battle, Deku and the heroes are determined to prove that Shigaraki is not invincible.  







My Hero Academia&#39;s Shigaraki has caused some massive devastation, both in the final war itself and earlier in the story, using his enhanced Decay ability. His next target, however, may be his most impressive attempt to date, as Shigaraki sets his sights on a symbol of incredible importance: Mt. Fuji.

The battle between Shigaraki and Deku hasn&#39;t been going great for the young hero, who, in chapter #411, had one of One for All&#39;s Quirks stolen away, costing him greatly while empowering Shigaraki further. The loss of Deku&#39;s Danger Sense makes the fight that much more dangerous, as Shigaraki was able to lead him into the area of Mt. Fuji, where his destructive power has the potential for real calamity.

          

As Shigaraki gloats about his desire to level the horizon until nothing stands, the vestiges within One for All realize that Shigaraki&#39;s Decay could very well destroy critical parts of the mountain, triggering a volcanic eruption like Japan has never seen.





 Destroying Mt. Fuji Puts Shigaraki Leagues Ahead of Deku 
          

The fact that Shigaraki even thinks he has the power to destroy a mountain is concerning enough, but there&#39;s a very real chance that he could pull it off, especially if he did manage to trigger a volcanic eruption. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Shigaraki did destroy several square miles of cities, including massive skyscrapers, all without leaving a trace. His power has grown exponentially since then, so taking out an entire mountain the size of Mt. Fuji could be within his abilities at the moment. It&#39;s a level of power that even All fo One couldn&#39;t hope to compete with, as proven by his recent defeat at the hands of Bakugo.

Tactically, destroying Mt. Fuji would force Deku to get distracted by the damage caused by the eruption, but there would also be a huge psychological toll from its loss. My Hero Academia has a focus on the power of symbols, with All Might as the &#34;Symbol of Peace&#34; and All for One as the &#34;Symbol of Fear.&#34; Mt. Fuji itself is something of a symbol as well, representing Japan and its people as a whole, so Mt. Fuji being destroyed would be a tremendous morale blow to everyone fighting against the villains to restore Japan to the way it was. Shigaraki is definitely counting on this demoralizing effect, giving them a show of power that can make battling against him feel hopeless.






 Shigaraki Wants To Destroy The Ground Heroes Stand Upon 
          

Shigaraki announced his intention of destroying Japan physically, letting his Decay spread to the ground and sinking the entire archipelago. Deku is definitely facing an uphill battle, but his ability to adapt to the changing conditions on the battlefield has proven that he&#39;s not out of the fight yet. Shigaraki&#39;s power may seem limitless at this point, but even All for One had limitations that finally caught up with him. Deku has been pushed to his own limits, but now it&#39;s time for My Hero Academia to turn the tables and prove to Shigaraki that he isn&#39;t omnipotent.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
