## Literature Review

Bullbuster is a mecha show with a sense of comedy. Despite the cast&#39;s task to battle fearsome beasts, their real enemy is their budget.





A trailer posted on the Kadokawa Anime Channel on YouTube provided plenty of footage for the upcoming anime. While its emphasis on office and company drama isn&#39;t typical for the genre, it brings to mind other cult classics that tried similar ideas. Either way, Bullbuster looks to shake up genre norms with its parody elements.

According to the (translated) synopsis on its official website, Bullbuster has a unique premise:


&#34;A young engineer, Tetsurou Okino, is transferred to a vermin extermination company called Hato Industries with the new robot Bullbuster that he developed himself. There, Hato Industries, a small company with little money, and its president Tajima are against a mysterious creature. There are fuel costs for robots, labor costs for pilots, and of course, wasting even a single bullet is unacceptable. Between their ideals of extermination and the reality of budgets, what does the future hold for Hato?&#34;


The trailer shows what to expect when the hot-headed mecha pilot is cajoled by an accountant, stating, &#34;You&#39;re using too much ammo. We&#39;re clearly over budget!&#34; Bullbuster&#39;s true interest seems to be putting various clashing personalities in one room as the cast struggles with fighting a monster infestation and also making money back on the venture. While Okina and the other pilots would love to just have an old-fashioned mech battle, accountant Kintaro and put-upon office lady Miyuki balance out the setting by showing how the titular Bullbuster needs to get its funding and weapons from somewhere.




The tone is markedly different from even the most practical Real Robot shows that assume that all the bullets and repairs will be paid for by the military, or at least some arms company that lingers in the background. If anything, Bullbuster reminds one of cult mecha shows like Patlabor and DaiGard. The former depicted a Japan where giant robots were common to the point of banality, and police officers were nagged about wasting money when firing a single bullet. DaiGard, meanwhile, echoes Bullbuster in depicting a corporate robot that&#39;s equal parts savior of humanity and bureaucratic nightmare.

With the last Patlabor movie coming out in 2002, and DaiGard having its brief limelight in 2000, Bullbuster is a well-timed successor to more grounded mech shows. Studio Nut is handling the adaptation; known best for bringing Youjo Senki to screens, meaning Bullbuster will have no shortage of spectacle. As the trailers attest, it won&#39;t all be pencil-pushing, as Okina&#39;s robot tangles with the mysterious monster with on no-holds-barred battles. With a premiere date of October 4, mech fans shouldn&#39;t miss what Bullbuster has to offer â€“ even if Hato Industries will have to agonize about the costs afterward.
