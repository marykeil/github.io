## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #12 will hopefully be a great finale and wrap up the current plot lines while setting up more for the future.




After the major cliffhanger at the end of episode #11, fans are looking forward to seeing how The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #12 will wrap up the plotlines surrounding Rose and the Oriana kingdom. Based on the cataclysmic scale of the threat wielded by the Cult of Diabolos, it will probably also cause Shadow to go all out. With episode #12 being the season finale, it will likely also bring one of 2023&#39;s best fantasy anime to a great close.

 What Happened In The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #11? 
          




Episode #11 featured more of the buildup to Rose&#39;s wedding, during which time Cid discovered that her mother the queen had betrayed her to have an affair with her betrothed, Doem Ketsuhat. When Cid revealed this to Rose, she was disgusted and after some further encouragement, she resolved to not go through with the marriage. At the ceremony, she confronted Doem, and when she put on the powerful ring she had accidentally received as a great joke from Shadow, it revealed to the kingdom the truth behind the former king&#39;s death. This caused the Cult to make their move and trigger a disastrous event known as the Black Rose.



The Cult also killed Doem and the queen during the wedding.






 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #12 Will Have Shadow Fight 
          




The power of the Black Rose seems incredibly destructive, as it annihilated vast swathes of the capital when it was first unleashed. In addition, it seems the Rose can spawn powerful beings with apocalyptic names like Ragnarok. However, Shadow was able to deal with Ragnarok pretty easily so he may be easily up to the challenge that the Black Rose presents. However, he likely won&#39;t be able to deal with the Black Rose and Mordred simultaneously, meaning Rose and the other members of Shadow Garden will have to defeat him. This would allow all the main characters in this arc a chance to shine.

Everything is set up for this season&#39;s finale to be as epic a fight as the battle between Shadow, Iris and Beatrix in last season&#39;s finale. Given the destructive nature of the battle, in the aftermath the finale will likely establish a new status quo for the kingdom of Oriana if it isn&#39;t demolished in the fighting. This makes The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #12 one of the most important episodes in the series and one that fans shouldn&#39;t miss when it airs on HIDIVE on December 20.
