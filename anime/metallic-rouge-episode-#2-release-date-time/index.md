 What Happened In Metallic Rouge Episode 1? 
          




Metallic Rouge takes place in the future on Mars when humans coexist with androids called Neans, although said coexistence is strained by humans abusing Neans and Neans can’t fight back due to the Asimov Code. Episode #1, “Crimson Is the Sound of Dawn”, explored that through Sarah Fitzgerald, a Nean working as a nightclub singer, and her spacey new assistant, Rouge Redstar, going about their lives the best they can. In reality, however, Rouge is an agent from the government organization Aletheia sent to Mars to kill the Immortal Nine, a group of violent Neans who defy the Asimov Code, and Sarah is secretly a former member named Purgatory Viola.

Another one of the Immortal Nine, Hell Giallon, forced Sarah to try and kill Rouge when Rouge was suspected of being the red Gladiator who killed two other members, a suspicion he’s proven right about. Now dubbing herself Metal Rouge, a Nean who can also defy the Asimov Code, Rouge and Sarah battled it out, and thanks to Rouge’s partner, Naomi Orthmann, analyzing Sarah’s fighting style, Rouge was able to win the fight. Sarah reflected on their relationship with remorse and regret, but Rouge seemed to ignore her and just went to Naomi to ask what their next assignment would be.

 Metallic Rouge Will Be An Anime With A Lot Of Gray Morality 
          

While there isn’t a lot known about Metallic Rouge at this point, something made very clear by episode #1 is that the series is going to have a lot of gray morality in its narrative. While the Immortal Nine might be the villains of the story, the poor treatment of Neans adds a deal of sympathy to them, and the complete lack of sympathy Rouge appears to have toward her fellow Neans, including Sarah, calls into question how heroic the protagonists are meant to be. It all makes for a very interesting sort of conflict, and it will be great to see how Metallic Rouge develops that, going forward.
