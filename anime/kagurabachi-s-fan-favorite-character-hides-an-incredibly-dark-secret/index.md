## Literature Review

Kagurabachi has finally revealed the dark truth behind Char&#39;s adorable smile and her big secret may leave the series more interesting than before.





Chapter #6 of Kagurabachi finally explains the reason for Char&#39;s endless pursuit by sorcerers and assassins despite being only a child. The chapter reveals Char belongs to a clan called the Kyonagi whose flesh is rumored to grant immortality to those who eat it. This rumor led to nearly the entire clan being wiped with the exception of Char, who is the sole remaining survivor.




          

That said, the chapter also suggests there may be some truth behind this rumor and Char may possess an ability that could be a game changer down the line, as she is shown instantly healing from terrible injuries. Not only Char&#39;s entire family was killed because of a rumor, but her powers make her the target of ruthless people who consider her a guinea pig, or worse.


 Char&#39;s Regenerative Abilities Make Her a Valuable Companion 
          

Chapter #6 of Kagurabachi reveals that despite the unverified rumor, Char does possess extreme regeneration capable of reverting any physical damage almost instantly. While Char has yet to display any control over this ability, her potential and the possibility of her learning to extend this ability to others would make her a valuable addition to the main cast, complementing the powers of Chihiro&#39;s katana. More importantly, Chihiro&#39;s opponents are sure to get stronger as the story progresses making Char&#39;s particular skill set especially useful in such a situation. The enchanted blades have already been established as quite disastrous weapons when in the wrong hands and are sure to be just as fearsome as the mysterious Hishaku who seem to be pulling the strings in the shadows.




                  Kagurabachi Already Proved Why It&#39;s Different From Jujutsu Kaisen   While the hype surrounding Shonen Jumpâ€™s hot new manga Kagurabachi has focused on its likeness to Jujutsu Kaisen, it has a plan to go its own way.   

Nonetheless, Char has been consistently developing a bond with Chihiro who likely sympathizes with her given their very similar tragic backstories, and with her secret finally out in the open the two may finally be able to trust each other better. That said, Char will likely continue to be hunted, forcing her to remain with Chihiro for the sake of protection, and though that may make her a liability at the moment, her physical abilities will surely be immensely useful going forward.

In any case, Kagurabachi has been an instant success with fans taking an instant liking to its characters and premise, and Char is no exception. Regardless of her unique powers, Char is undeniably adorable, and her permanent addition to the main cast would add just the right amount of light-heartedness to the rather serious, grim tone of Kagurabachi.
