## Literature Review

Kagurabachi&#39;s instant success and the rising popularity of manga prove the manga industry may be quite literally taking over the world.





Kagurabachi&#39;s success isn&#39;t simply a product of its narrative, action sequence, or the presence of classic shonen tropes, but an indicator of a shift in the manga industry over the last couple of years with increased readership and popularity in the West than before. As the editor of Shueisha, Momiyama puts it in this X post, &#34;We are on the verge of realizing an era in which the series will grow into a popular work all over the world.&#34;




                  New Shonen Jump Series is Already Receiving Massive Hype Even Before Its Release   With the curtains closing on some manga, new players like the upcoming manga series Kagurabachi are generating big hype before release.   


 Kagurabachi Proves Manga&#39;s Success In The West Is Changing The Industry 
          

As Momiyama points out in his post, series like Kagurabachi and Kaiju No. 8 are proof that a series&#39; global popularity no longer depends on its performance in Japan or the subsequent reception of its anime adaptation in the West. In the past years, if a series did well in Japan it would then be picked up for an anime adaptation to drive sales to the volumes and the anime would then draw in international audiences, in turn increasing the demand for translations. However, with the easy online availability of official translations on platforms such as Manga Plus, a series no longer has to go through this long, drawn-out process to reach fans all over the world.




The effect of this simple yet revolutionary change can be best seen in the curious case of series that are much more popular in the West than in Japan. More recent examples of the globalization of manga can be seen in Manga Plus&#39; new billing and subscription plan that has revolutionized the accessibility of manga globally. Kagurabachi&#39;s success is mostly coming from a high number of readers for its first chapters on Manga Plus, and from the huge buzz it created on social media and other online discussion platforms. It&#39;s no indicator that the series will sell well in Japan, but Shueisha&#39;s executives are still taking notice, proving that finally the global success of the medium is starting to have an influence in Japan too.

          

The anime and manga industry has been making its way outside Japan for quite a few years but while series like Dragon Ball, Naruto, and One Piece have taken decades to establish their fan base, the instantaneous success of series like Kagurabachi prove this may not be the case for much longer. The fact that manga industry executives are taking notice of the success of a series overseas, as seen when Kagurabachi surpassed even My Hero Academia and Chainsaw Man in viewership on Manga Plus, means that the industry is set to change forever, with one possible consequence being that in the future less series that are beloved by Western readers will get uncerimoniously canceled.




Kagurabachi is available from Viz Media.
