## Literature Review

Though they are often underappreciated, healers play the important role of allowing wounded anime heroes to recover from even the gravest injuries.





Depending on the setting and world, the power source and method of healers can vary greatly, from elite doctors who can treat even the rarest of conditions, to those who use magic to perform miraculous feats such as undoing the effects of death itself. But only the ones who can make a significant difference in their world can count themselves among the most remarkable, godlike healers.









 








 10  Orihime Inoue (Bleach) 
        

While Bleach&#39;s cast includes multiple accomplished healers, such as Retsu Unohana, no one is quite on the same level as Orihime Inoue. Thanks to her naturally high spiritual power, she is talented in detecting and controlling spiritual energy. Her spirit energy is harbored in the six-petal flower-shaped hairpins she received from her brother, where six different spirits lie. Using her spirits, Orihime can cast incredible techniques such as Sōten Kisshun, which doesn&#39;t technically &#34;heal&#34;, but rather allows her to deny and undo certain events, even going as far as to restore missing limbs and resurrect people. Nothing says &#34;godlike&#34; like bringing back people from the dead.





 9  Akiko Yosano (Bungo Stray Dogs) 
        

As the Armed Detective Agency&#39;s personal physician, Akiko Yosano is a true expert in her field, possessing rich knowledge in terms of human anatomy and physiology. As Bungo Stray Dogs revolves around special abilities though, it&#39;s her rare ability that allows her to differentiate herself from other physicians. Using &#34;Thou Shalt Not Die&#34;, Akiko can instantly heal any and all external wounds, both in and outside of combat, provided the target is nearly dead. The condition may seem limiting, but she has no qualms about injuring others to bring them closer to the necessary stage of being barely alive. Unfortunately, this ability has no effect on internal injuries and illnesses.





 8  Tsunade (Naruto) 
        

As Konohagakure&#39;s Fifth Hokage, Naruto&#39;s Tsunade is not only one of the world&#39;s strongest kunoichi, but also a legendary medical-nin, or ninja specialized in healing techniques. Her abilities as a medical-nin are truly unrivaled, as she has been noted to instantly identify any illness, and also easily treat conditions that most would consider impossible to recover from. She can heal anything from physical to psychological damage, and even solve cases of severe chakra depletion. Tsunade&#39;s strongest technique is her Creation Rebirth, which instantly heals any wounds, making her nearly immortal, but it comes at the cost of shortening her lifespan, which is why she only uses it as a last resort.
            
 
 A Forgotten Boruto Mystery Could Make A Comeback In Two Blue Vortex 
A potential plot tease that was forgotten about almost immediately could end up having major implications for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex going forward.








 7  Josuke Higashikata (JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable) 
        

JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is all about iconic Stand abilities, which vary significantly in terms of both form and power. Diamond is Unbreakable&#39;s main protagonist, Josuke Higashikata, wields the Stand known as Crazy Diamond, which doesn&#39;t strictly heal, but rather restores objects and organisms to a previous state. This way, Josuke can not only repair anything but also heal virtually any injury, as long as it&#39;s not lethal. Thanks to his intelligence and mastery over his Stand, he always finds ways to use this ability creatively, adapting to any situation and making use of his environment. The only downside is that he cannot heal himself, which would require him to be more cautious, but that&#39;s not in Josuke&#39;s personality at all, so he will rush into any dangerous situation without regrets.





 6  Ria Karasuma (Healer Girl) 
        

While music is not uncommon in the anime world, thanks to the popularity of idol anime series, there is nothing quite like Healer Girl, wherein the musical moments are more akin to stage plays or Disney scenes. Its story takes place in a world wherein music is a valid, scientifically proven form of healing, and Ria Karasuma is at the top of the voice medicine world. Not only is she a renowned healer who runs her own clinic and teaches apprentice girls who hope to become like her, but she also conducts research on music healing, actively working towards advancing the field.





 5  Alluka Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter) 
        

Hunter x Hunter&#39;s Alluka Zoldyck is not only a great example of trans representation, but also one of the anime world&#39;s most powerful characters. Truthfully though, despite being born into a family of infamous deadly assassins, Alluka has no exceptional strengths, either physical or Nen-related. Instead, the source of her power is Nanika, a mysterious creature from the Dark Continent who possessed her body. Nanika can grant any wishes, presumably to an infinite extent, after three of Alluka&#39;s requests are fulfilled. In terms of healing, a notable example would be when she healed Gon, whose body was in a critical state, almost dying as a result of a Nen contract.





 4  Wendy Marvell (Fairy Tail) 
        

Fairy Tail&#39;s Wendy Marvell uses Sky Dragon Slayer Magic, whose potential is multifaceted. Not only does it allow her to cast surprisingly powerful offensive and versatile support spells, but it also makes her a fantastic healer, able to cure even the gravest of injuries. Prior to her using this magic, it was believed to be long-lost, which indicates just how rare and significant it is. As one would expect, she can heal various wounds and negate the effects of potent poison, but that&#39;s not the full extent of her power, as she has even been noted to revive people who were in a near-death state.





 3  Tony Tony Chopper (One Piece) 
        

As the Straw Hat Pirates&#39; resident doctor, Tony Tony Chopper&#39;s medical skills aren&#39;t owed to one of One Piece&#39;s many Devil Fruits, but rather to his adoptive parental figures, Hiriluk and Kureha, two doctors who took care of him and taught him everything they knew about medicine. After learning the foundations of the field, he further increased his knowledge in the Torino Kingdom, where he studied books on drugs and herbs that the rest of the world was unfamiliar with. He has continued to learn and evolve as a doctor ever since, proving himself through extraordinary feats such as quickly developing new cures and treating brutal injuries.





 2  Falma de Médicis (Parallel World Pharmacy) 
        

Parallel World Pharmacy follows a world-class medical researcher who overworked himself to death and was reincarnated as Falma de Médicis, the heir of an esteemed family of pharmacologists, in an alternate, less developed world. Combining the knowledge from his previous life with the unique powers he obtained thanks to a deity&#39;s divine blessing, Falma can perform miraculous feats such as creating and destroying any substance whose molecular structure he&#39;s familiar with. Additionally, he also has divine sight, which lets him identify the medical issues of any person he&#39;s looking at. Lastly, unlike other people in his world, there seems to be no limit to his magic powers, making his potential unrivaled.





 1  Elizabeth Liones (The Seven Deadly Sins) 
        

While Elizabeth Liones may not be one of the titular sins, she is still one of The Seven Deadly Sins&#39; most likable characters, as well as a surprisingly powerful one. As the current queen of the Kingdom of Liones and the current incarnation of the Goddess Elizabeth, she possesses immense light-based powers, being able to heal everyone in the kingdom at once in an instant. After learning to control her abilities, she proves herself to be incredibly talented, even more skillful than the best druids, easily healing multiple people who suffered lethal damage, as well as dispelling powerful curses placed by the Demon King&#39;s magic.
While these characters may not be the most memorable of their series, as viewers tend to instead admire the ones defined by their seemingly endless strength, they may very well be the ones who played the most important role. Thanks to their healing powers, they allowed others to shine, often without expecting anything in turn. Some are even powerful enough to resurrect those who underestimated the threats they were facing, allowing fan-favorite characters to keep driving the action. Truly, anime healers deserve far more recognition than they usually receive.
