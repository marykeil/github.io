## Literature Review

Suzume’s ending features time travel and ancient gods but it’s not as complex as that of Your Name, while still stirring viewers&#39; feelings.




Like the other movies by Makoto Shinkai, Suzume has a complex ending that encapsulates all the themes presented in the story and delivers a powerful message. While the ending of Suzume may seem a bit cryptic at first, it&#39;s actually easy to interpret once the movie is put in perspective through the author&#39;s previous works.




Suzume is the latest movie by modern anime maestro Makoto Shinkai, who rose to prominence for Your Name (2016) and Weathering With You (2019). It&#39;s the coming-of-age story for the 17-year-old protagonist, Suzume, set in various disaster-stricken locations across Japan, where she must close the doors causing devastation.


 The Story of Suzume 
          

Suzume’s journey begins in a quiet town in Kyushu (the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan) when she encounters Souta, a young man who travels Japan, searching for mysterious doors located in the ruins of places abandoned by humans. When Suzume finds one of such doors near her hometown, she unwillingly releases a guardian deity, freeing the supernatural force it was guarding, called &#34;the Worm&#34;. After Suzume and Souta seal the first door, more begin to open one after another all across Japan, which must be closed before the Worm can unleash an earthquake in the surrounding area.




                  Suzume Blows Past One Piece, Becomes Fourth Highest-Grossing Anime Film Ever   One Piece Film: Red set an amazing box office record during its theatrical run, but Makoto Shinkai&#39;s Suzume has managed to completely surpass it.   

Unfortunately, Souta is cursed by the guardian deity, Daijin, and transformed into the kid&#39;s chair that Suzume keeps as a memento of her mom, making her task even more difficult. Despite that, she bravely embarks on a journey across Japan, meeting different people and collecting meaningful experiences that help her grow up and overcome her tragic past. Suzume&#39;s only parent, her mother, was killed in the Great Sendai Earthquake that hit Japan on March 11, 2011, which understandably left her emotionally scarred, despite being raised by her loving and caring aunt, Tamaki. Suzume&#39;s journey finally leads her to Tokyo, where Souta makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes the Keystone needed to seal the Worm again.



 What Happens in Suzume&#39;s Ending 
          




Suzume&#39;s story doesn&#39;t end with Souta&#39;s sacrifice, however. Suzume refuses to abandon the young man she has grown to love, and with the help of Tamaki and Souta&#39;s friend, Serizawa, she travels to her hometown and the ruins of the house where she lived with her mother. Souta is trapped in the Ever-After, which is essentially the realm of souls where the mysterious doors lead to, and the only door that Suzume can travel through as a living person is the one that she crossed as a kid, when she got lost while desperately looking for her mother.

In the Ever-After, Daijin has a change of heart and decides to help Suzume in freeing Souta. However, the Worm is raging and trying to escape to the world of the living, where he will cause massive destruction. Daijin turns back into the Keystone and, together with his twin deity, Sadaijin, they let Suzume and Souta use them to seal the Worm in the Ever-After again. After that, Suzume sees her younger self wandering into the spirit realm and goes to comfort her, giving kid Suzume the chair that her mother had built for her before dying, and reassuring her that she will grow up and meet many people who will love her and make her happy. Then, Suzume and Souta return to their world and their lives.

 Suzume&#39;s Ending Explained 
          

To understand the actual meaning of Suzume&#39;s ending, it is important to remember that, like in all the works of Makoto Shinkai, the characters and the story are a vehicle to convey a message to the audience. According to an interview Shinkai did for the Berlin Film Festival, the Great Earthquake of 2011 changed his life (and the life of his compatriots) radically. He realized that he could no longer create entertainment for the sake of it, but his mission had to be to use his art to share that traumatic experience with the world, and perhaps find some meaning in it. This is where Suzume comes from, and what inspired Shikai&#39;s previous movies too.

In the movie, the Worm represents the destructive power of nature, which lays dormant until it&#39;s unleashed on the world. The doors open in abandoned places because, according to Souta, the weight of people&#39;s feelings is what quells the land. Through Suzume&#39;s journey, the movie shows the natural beauty of Japan, but also the tragedies that natural disasters leave behind. The only thing that people can do when faced with them is accept their role as part of something larger and move on, looking at the future with hope. The doors that Suzume and Souta close literally connect the past to the present and the future, thus the gesture of closing them is a metaphor for coming to terms with the past, no matter how tragic it is.




Time is also an important element of Shikai&#39;s works that returns in Suzume&#39;s ending. When she wandered through the door as a kid, Suzume met someone who she believed was her mother, even if the memory faded with time. However, the finale reveals that the person was actually grown-up Suzume herself, something that was possible because, as explained by Souta earlier in the movie, in the Ever-After all time exists simultaneously. Meeting one&#39;s future self is somewhat of an overused cliché, but it worked better than usual in this specific case.



 What Suzume is Really About 
          

Ultimately, Suzume is a movie about the power of memories and feelings to connect people, exemplified by the fact that, to close a door, Suzume and Souta have to think about the people who lived in that place and their feelings. The ending of Suzume may not be as shocking as that of Your Name, or sad as that of Weathering With You, but it&#39;s really effective in transmitting the message that Makoto Shinkai strived to communicate to his audiences.
