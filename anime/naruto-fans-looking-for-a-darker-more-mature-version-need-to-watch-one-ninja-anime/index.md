## Literature Review

The 2005 series Basilisk is a compelling dark and grim take counterpoint to relatively light-hearted shonen ninja series like Naruto.






Basilisk contains intense graphic violence and sensitive content.







Though it is one of the most famous anime ever made, Naruto is hardly the only anime about ninja. Some other ninja series take the genre to a darker, more mature place. Originally a manga that ran from 2003 to 2004 based on a novel from 1958, with an anime adaptation in 2005, Basilisk is the dark and grim counterpart to a relatively light-hearted ninja series like Naruto.

At is most simple, Basilisk is a story in the vein of Romeo and Juliet, though with a cast of super-powered ninja like Naruto: two clans at war, the heirs of those warring clans are in the middle of a doomed love affair. With that premise in mind, it is hardly surprising that the series doesn&#39;t have a happy ending.

          

The relentless darkness and constant character deaths can admittedly be off-putting, but the series is executed with enough style and unique story elements that it is worth at least one watch, especially for ninja fans looking for a more mature take on shinobi action.





 Basilisk is Naruto&#39;s Bleaker &amp; More Mature Counterpart 
          

The story of Basilisk begins towards the end of the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shogun. Ieyasu decides to use the feuding Iga and Kouga clans to settle the dispute over which of his grandsons will succeed him. Each clan fights on behalf of one of Ieyasu&#39;s grandsons and is told to select their ten best ninjas to fight until one clan wipes out the other. Basilisk fully commits to that dark premise, with the brutal violence resulting in a high death count by the series&#39; end.

Basilisk&#39;s visual style is consistently one of the series&#39; greatest strengths. Each of the ninjas has a distinct visual design and slate of powers that make the characters memorable at first glance. Unfortunately, characters are introduced almost as quickly as they&#39;re killed off, with some ninjas getting less than an episode of screen time. This, combined with the fact that there are only a handful of truly sympathetic characters, makes it hard to cheer for either the Iga or the Kouga. The end of the feud doesn&#39;t really bring a sense of relief or satisfaction. If anything, the audience will probably just be exhausted to have witnessed so much brutality and bloodshed for so little benefit.




                  10 Best Anime That Followed Naruto&#39;s Legacy   Given that Naruto is one of Shonen Jump&#39;s famous Big 3, it was always inevitable that newer stories would be influenced by it in some way.   

If anything, that really just highlights the series&#39; inherent tragedy. No matter which clan wins, they both ultimately lose. Before Ieyasu commands the two clans to fight, they were actually at peace. It&#39;s a bleak statement about the politics and social hierarchy of historical Feudal Japan, and the futility of war in general, but it&#39;s also a powerful one. The original series found at least enough of an audience to get two sequel series: The Yagyu Ninja Scrolls and the Ouka Ninja Scrolls, though a certain amount of creativity was required on the part of the sequels&#39; writers to account for the fact that the entire original cast died.

Naruto does have moments of thematic darkness and character death, but at its core, the series is very much a shonen series that never really stops being accessible to audiences of all ages. Basilisk, on the other hand, is indisputably adult and relentlessly dark and bleak. That may not appeal to everyone, but Basilisk&#39;s unique spin on the genre makes it a must-watch for Naruto fans looking for a darker and more adult story.
