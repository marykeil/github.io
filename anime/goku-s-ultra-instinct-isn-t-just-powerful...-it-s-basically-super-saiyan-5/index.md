# Goku s Ultra Instinct isn t Just Powerful... It s Basically Super Saiyan 5


## SUMMARY 



  Super Saiyan 5, a fan-made concept, has similarities to Ultra Instinct in Dragon Ball Super, giving fans a version of what they imagined Super Saiyan 5 would be.   Ultra Instinct gives Goku a power surpassing even gods, similar to the power imagined for Super Saiyan 5, and aesthetically, both forms change the Saiyan&#39;s hair to a white/silver color.   The idea of Super Saiyan 5 was teased in Dragon Ball GT, but the differences between Super Saiyan 5 and Ultra Instinct are enough to make the comparison debatable among fans. However, both forms represent the pinnacle of power in the Dragon Ball universe.

## Literature Review

Even though Super Saiyan 5 was completely fabricated with a now-famous piece of fan art, Dragon Ball basically made it canon and no one even noticed.




While the real-world legend of Super Saiyan 5 disappointingly proved to be non-canonical within the Dragon Ball saga, the seemingly godlike form was basically added to the series with Ultra Instinct. Though Goku&#39;s Ultra Instinct is officially its own line of transformation, a closer look reveals more than a few similarities to fan ideas about a potential Super Saiyan 5.




Super Saiyan 5 originated as fan art drawn by artist David Montiel Franco. When the image made its rounds all over the internet in the late 90s and early 2000s, the current ongoing Dragon Ball anime at the time was Dragon Ball GT, which launched in 1996 in Japan, a series that introduced fans to Super Saiyan 4. Seemingly following the aesthetic of Super Saiyan 4, Super Saiyan 5 depicts the Saiyan (one who was later revealed to be an original character by Franco named Tablos) in a more primal form with long hair and fur covering most of his body. The form also gave the Saiyan white/silver hair.


 Dragon Ball&#39;s Ultra Instinct is Eerily Similar to Franco&#39;s Super Saiyan 5 
          

Even though it is just a fan-made picture linked to a fake Dragon Ball series known as Dragon Ball AF, the Super Saiyan 5 image carries with it the promise of a power unlike anything fans had ever seen before. While Super Saiyan 5 ended up being something of a hoax, fans still basically got a version of the form in the current Dragon Ball storyline, or at least, the version fans imagined they would have gotten with the ‘real’ Super Saiyan 5.




In Dragon Ball Super by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou, Goku and Vegeta have unlocked godlike powers, not just with the incredibly powerful Super Saiyan Blue form, but power levels that only gods and angels have wielded before. Vegeta has reached a power used by Gods of Destruction known as Ultra Ego, but it’s Goku’s achievement that is truly notable, as he basically made Super Saiyan 5 canon through his use of Ultra Instinct.

Like the power Super Saiyan 5 was imagined to have held, Ultra Instinct gives one the power that surpasses that of a god, proven true by Lord Beerus who hasn’t yet unlocked that particular ability himself. Plus, aesthetically, it’s not that far off. Rather than the Super Saiyan 4 style of long hair and fur Super Saiyan 5 is seemingly derived from, Ultra Instinct keeps Goku’s form relatively the same. However, just as Super Saiyan 5 turns a Saiyan’s hair white/silver, Ultra Instinct changes Goku’s hair to a similar color, albeit a bit more shiny/silvery than Super Saiyan 5’s more prominent white.






 Dragon Ball GT Already Teased Super Saiyan 5 
          

Interestingly, in the Dragon Ball GT episode &#34;The Heart of the Prince,&#34; the idea of Super Saiyan 5 is brought up. Bulma has determined that Saiyans must be exposed to something called Blutz Waves in order to obtain the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, and has developed a machine that can apply these waves to Vegeta. Bulma speculates that this intense emitter might even allow him to exceed even Super Saiyan 4, causing Vegeta to wonder with astonishment at the possibility of a Super Saiyan 5. The lines play out a little differently in the dub, with Bulma being the one to mention Super Saiyan 5, but the idea is posited in both versions of the episode, although Vegeta (obviously) never obtains such a transformation.

While there are similarities, the differences between Super Saiyan 5 and Ultra Instinct are enough to keep this comparison from being obvious, and even perhaps make the comparison flat out disagreeable to some fans. However, the essence of Ultra Instinct has proven to be the pinnacle of power, power that even gods struggle to access. When fans saw the Super Saiyan 5 fan art for the first time, the feeling it invoked gave one the impression that this was it, the final and most powerful form a Saiyan could accomplish. While there will assuredly be a power level even greater than Ultra Instinct in the future, as it stands, it is the end-all be-all for how powerful a character can be in the Dragon Ball universe, and that is enough to make it comparable with the fan-made legend of Super Saiyan 5.
