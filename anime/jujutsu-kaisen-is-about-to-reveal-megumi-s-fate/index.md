# Jujutsu Kaisen Is About To Reveal Megumi s Fate


## SUMMARY 



  Megumi&#39;s fate in Jujutsu Kaisen is uncertain, but there are two possible outcomes: he may be alive but incapacitated, or he could already be dead with Sukuna possessing his corpse.   Even if Megumi is still alive, he is likely in poor shape emotionally and mentally. The burden he has carried and the deaths he has witnessed will have taken a toll on him.   Despite his current condition, Megumi still has a role to play in the story. He has the potential to unlock the full power of his technique, which could be crucial in the battle against Sukuna.

Summary

  Megumi&#39;s fate in Jujutsu Kaisen is uncertain, but there are two possible outcomes: he may be alive but incapacitated, or he could already be dead with Sukuna possessing his corpse.   Even if Megumi is still alive, he is likely in poor shape emotionally and mentally. The burden he has carried and the deaths he has witnessed will have taken a toll on him.   Despite his current condition, Megumi still has a role to play in the story. He has the potential to unlock the full power of his technique, which could be crucial in the battle against Sukuna.  







After keeping fans in the dark for chapters on end, Jujutsu Kaisen has finally teased the fate of Sukuna&#39;s new vessel, Megumi, and it could go one of two ways. Megumi&#39;s fate has been uncertain ever since Sukuna forcefully switched vessels, with the recent revelation of Sukuna&#39;s true form only raising further doubt. Fortunately, the latest chapter hints that there may still be hope for Megumi, however slim it may be.

In chapter #244 of Jujutsu Kaisen, Higuruma mentions two possible outcomes for Megumi when discussing the possible crimes Sukuna could be convicted of using his Cursed Technique. According to Higuruma, Megumi may still be alive but incapacitated, or he could already be dead, with Sukuna possessing his corpse. This would allow Higuruma to sue Sukuna for bodily injury or murder and illegal possession of a dead body.

          




Though the chapter does not directly confirm Megumi&#39;s condition, it does present fans with two likely possibilities, hinting there may still be hope for Megumi to make a comeback at some point in the narrative going forward.

               :   Sukuna&#39;s Real Form In Jujutsu Kaisen Is The Final Insult To Gojo   Sukuna has finally been reincarnated in Jujutsu Kaisen, and his true form proves the fight against Gojo may have been decided from the start.   


 Megumi Is Alive But Likely in Poor Shape 
          

Even if Megumi is still alive after Sukuna&#39;s reincarnation, he is likely to be in poor shape both emotionally and mentally from Tsumiki and Gojo&#39;s deaths, as well as the battle against Gojo. Megumi was forced to bear the load of Unlimited Void five times along with the burden of Mahoraga&#39;s adaptation, which has likely left him in a vegetative state for the time being.




Nonetheless, it seems doubtful that Sukuna&#39;s reincarnation killed Megumi&#39;s soul completely, as he hasn&#39;t been given an appropriate ending. While Jujutsu Kaisen has never shied away from killing off major characters or fan favorites and has a long history of ambiguous deaths (look no further than Nobara, whose death has yet to be confirmed since the Shibuya Arc), it seems unlikely that the series would brush over Megumi&#39;s death completely. Moreover, despite being one of Gege Akutami&#39;s personally disliked characters, even Gojo&#39;s death came with some form of closure.

               :   Jujutsu Kaisen Hints A Fan-Favorite Character May Not Be Dead After All   Chapter #236 of Jujutsu Kaisen broke many hearts but also inadvertently raised hope for the return of one of the series&#39; most loved characters.   



 Megumi Still Has a Role To Play in Jujutsu Kaisen 
          




Despite his condition at present, Megumi&#39;s character arc within Jujutsu Kaisen is far from complete. Though he went down without a fight after Tsumiki&#39;s death, it would be interesting to see Megumi eventually fight back against Sukuna and attempt to take his revenge. Moreover, it can be argued Megumi has yet to unlock the full potential of the Ten Shadows Technique. While Yuji may seem the obvious choice for Sukuna&#39;s final opponent, Megumi&#39;s involvement could finally allow him to achieve this potential teased by the series on multiple occasions.

In all, seeing as the battle against Sukuna is quickly nearing a standstill, it might not be too long until Jujutsu Kaisen reveals Megumi&#39;s fate and whether he will play a part in shifting the tides against Sukuna. Hopefully, fans may not have to bid farewell to Megumi just yet.
