## Literature Review

Episode #35 of Pokémon Horizons revealed Captain Pikachu has a weakness, and while a bit silly, it helps to set him apart from his Pika predecessor.




Pokémon Horizons&#39; Captain Pikachu has proven to be a powerful fighter who can stand his ground against even opponents with major size advantages on him. As it turns out, however, Cap isn&#39;t invincible; in fact, his one weakness happens to be absolutely devastating for a Pikachu: he&#39;s allergic to being called &#34;cute.&#34;




In episode #35, Cap and Friede go out on a job to help raise funds for the airship and keep their operations going. They&#39;re accompanied by Liko and Roy, and are tasked with tracking down a missing Pokémon, a Bramblin. Bramblin was caught by the wind and blown away, making it very difficult to track down in a desert full of similar-looking tumbleweeds. The team split up and go around town asking about it, but it doesn&#39;t give them any new leads.

          

However, as they&#39;re asking around, two women notice Captain Pikachu and his hat, and immediately begin cooing about how cute he is. Instantly, Captain Pikachu begins sneezing everywhere, even falling off the fire hydrant he was standing on.


 Captain Pikachu&#39;s Weakness Makes Him Very Different from Ash&#39;s 
          




In the original anime, Ash&#39;s Pikachu never had any problems being called cute, and in fact seemed to enjoy the attention quite a bit. Captain Pikachu&#39;s backstory has already revealed that he was pretty different from other Pikachu, constantly dreaming of flying until he invented his Rising Volt Tackle, but never before has a Pikachu (or any Pokémon, really) had such a strong reaction to mere words. Pikachu are well-known throughout the Pokémon world for their cuteness, so this is likely a pretty big problem for Cap whenever he does decide to leave the airship on missions.

The &#34;allergy&#34; is even so bad that when the villain of the episode calls him cute (with the intention of stealing him), it begins to impact his ability to fight back. Given that Captain Pikachu has been able to conquer so many dangerous and powerful enemies already in the series, it&#39;s a bit nice to finally have such a weakness of his revealed. Cap was definitely at risk of becoming too powerful a force, and while he&#39;s able to overcome this weakness, it remains a problem that he may well have to deal with in the future.




Ash&#39;s Pikachu never really had any sort of comparable long-term problem, so this helps in further differentiating the two Pikachu as characters. The episode also showcased how different Friede and Cap&#39;s relationship is from Ash and his Pikachu&#39;s, as the two are shown arguing and fighting in a way that Ash and Pikachu rarely did. Of course, their relationship remains strong in spite of these squabbles, and Friede trusts Cap to execute a plan that ultimately saves the day.

Fortunately, Captain Pikachu&#39;s &#34;allergy&#34; to being called cute remains a secret to the crew only, ensuring that future Pokémon Horizons villains won&#39;t be able to exploit this weakness so easily.
