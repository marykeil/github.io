## Literature Review

Adventure fantasy is one of the most enduring genres in all of fiction, and some anime series have pushed the genre to unprecedented heights. 




Adventure is one of the most prolific genres in all fiction, and adventure anime are no exception. From the very conception of the medium, there have been countless anime of heroes traveling across the world for their sake and the sake of others, and the dangers they have to deal with and the growth that accompanies it always make for incredible stories that almost always stand the test of time.
Adventure is just as prolific a genre in anime as it is in other mediums, and there are some adventure anime, in particular, that stand out as among the best. Some stand out for how vivid a world they’re able to create for the heroes to either travel through or work to save, and others stand out for how thrilling of an adventure they put the heroes through and the character growth that accompanies that.
        

Whatever the case, there are plenty of adventure anime that do a great job of playing into the conventions of the genre, and each one of them is more than worth watching.









 








 10  Magi: The Labyrinth Of Magic Adds Anime Flair To The Arabian Nights 
Based On Shinobu Ohtaka&#39;s Magi: The Labyrinth Of Magic
        

  Release Year   2012    Number Of Episodes   50    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Funimation    
The first great adventure anime to discuss is A-1 Pictures’ Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. Magi took inspiration from the Arabian Nights to create a world with amazing depth that never failed to bring the heroes to one fantastical location after another, and seeing how the heroes would grow as they saw more and more of the world was always great. Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic always got to the core of what makes an adventure story, and with incredible direction and music from Koji Masunari and Shiro Sagisu, respectively, it’s more than worth watching for any fans of the genre.

 9  Vinland Saga Is A Must-See Historical Epic 
Based On Makoto Yukimura&#39;s Vinland Saga
        

  Release Year   2019    Number Of Episodes   48    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Netflix    
On the opposite end of the spectrum, a great adventure anime rooted in historical fiction is Studio MAPPA’s Vinland Saga. Vinland Saga starts as a blood-filled Viking epic with amazing action in almost every episode, and surprisingly, it gets even better in season 2 when it becomes a contemplative drama about the nature of war and humanity, a story that forces everyone across every corner of the world to try and fully process it. Vinland Saga might be darker than some of its contemporaries, but for anyone looking for an adventure story with a perfect balance between action and drama, no other anime would be better worth watching.

 8  Berserk (1997) Is Dark Fantasy Adventure At Its Finest 
Based On Kentaro Miura&#39;s Berserk
        

  Release Year   1997    Number Of Episodes   25    Where To Watch It   Netflix (selected countries)    
Another dark adventure anime that’s great to watch is OLM, Inc.’s Berserk. The original Berserk anime doesn’t get to the full extent of Kentaro Miura’s Tolkien-esque storytelling, but it still succeeds at creating a horrifying world of monsters where heroes and villains alike go from one battle to the next in search of their respective destinies, and that simple idea is adventure in its truest form. Berserk is unlikely to ever have a definitive anime adaptation, but for anyone looking for an adventure story that pushes boundaries while still telling a beautiful story, the original OLM, Inc. anime is still the best way to go.





 7  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Never Stops Being As Over-The-Top As Possible 
Original Anime By Hiroyuki Imaishi &amp; Kazuki Nakashima
        

  Release Year   2007    Number Of Episodes   27    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
For a more lighthearted adventure anime, a great series to watch is Studio Trigger’s Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. The series takes its cast all across a bizarre, yet frightening world that even sees them making their way into outer space, and not only is that progression made wholly natural, but it’s done in the most bombastic way possible that makes every episode as ridiculous and fun as an anime can be. With its emphasis on willpower and the infinite possibilities of humanity, Gurren Lagann is one of the best adventure anime to watch, and it’s more than upheld that legacy almost 20 years after its premiere.

 6  JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Perfectly Lives Up To Its Name 
Based On Hirohiko Araki&#39;s JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure


 







  Release Year   2012    Number Of Episodes   190    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix    
Another great adventure anime that thrives on being bizarre is David Production’s JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Befitting its name, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure always has the heroes doing battle with strange and gruesome foes, inhuman or otherwise, and having them do so by traveling all around the world across a legacy that spans over a century adds a wholly unique element to the story that’s gone on to be one of its biggest hooks. Every part in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, whether by itself or in contrast to another part, always succeeds at giving people something new to watch, and that serves to make it a great adventure story from start to finish.

 5  Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End Is Already A Modern Classic Among Adventure Anime 
Based On Kanehito Yamada &amp; Tsukasa Abe&#39;s Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End
        

  Release Year   2023    Number Of Episodes   28    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll    
Madhouse’s Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End might be a fairly recent series, but it’s already one of the best adventure anime to watch. Its positioning of being what happens after the heroes already saved the world makes for a premise not usually seen in adventure stories, and that’s used to tell a heartwrenching story about humanity and the need for connections with others that never fails to be emotionally resonant. Add in gorgeous art and animation, the former of which is plenty present in the manga, as well, and Frieren is already on its way to becoming a staple of the adventure genre.

 4  One Piece Is An Enduring Classic Among Adventure Anime 
Based On Eiichiro Oda&#39;s One Piece


 







  Release Year   1999    Number Of Episodes   1086    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix    
Conversely, one of the older and longer adventure anime for someone to watch is undoubtedly Toei Animation’s One Piece. With its fantastical takes on piracy, One Piece fashions itself as a classical romance—the older definition referring to adventure—that never fails to excite the characters and the audience with each new location that’s shown and the absurd lengths the characters have to go to save the day whenever trouble should arise. Every new adventure in One Piece is more exciting than the last, and it’s no wonder that the anime has risen to be the biggest anime franchise of all time.

 3  Hunter X Hunter Never Fails To Show How Excitingly Dangerous The World Can Be 
Based On Yoshihiro Togashi&#39;s Higashi&#39;s Hunter X Hunter
        

  Release Year   2011    Number Of Episodes   148    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix    
The original manga for Madhouse’s Hunter x Hunter is almost as old as One Piece, but it handles its adventure story very differently. Hunter x Hunter never shies away from how unforgiving the world can be, and that unflinching cruelty always makes for a dark and engaging story. At the same time, however, the series also makes a point about how much beauty and excitement there is underneath it all, which is why people would want to become Hunters in the first place, and that level of romanticism helps to make the world of Hunter x Hunter a truly marvelous one that still grabs people’s attention after so many years.

 2  Dragon Quest: The Adventure Of Dai Is Classic Adventure At Its Peak 
Based On Riku Sanjo &amp; Koji Inada&#39;s Dragon Quest: The Adventure Of Dai
        

  Release Year   2020    Number Of Episodes   100    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Toei Animation’s Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai might not be the most inventive adventure anime, but it’s still a great watch, nonetheless. The series plays into all the classic tropes of a fantasy adventure, but the sincerity with which it handles everything makes its story come off as fresh instead of cliché, and watching every fight and the growth they instill in the cast is always a stellar sight to behold. The fact that the anime boasts some of the best animation from the company in years also helps with that, and overall, anyone who’s a fan of adventure stories would be remiss to pass it over.

 1  Dragon Ball Is Still An Amazing Adventure Anime Almost 40 Years Later 
Based On Akira Toriyama&#39;s Dragon Ball


 







  Release Year   1986    Number Of Episodes   508    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
When it comes to great adventure anime, of course, the one series that has to be mentioned is Toei Animation’s Dragon Ball. The series starts as a hilarious anime take on Journey to the West that slowly evolves into a martial arts epic that sees the heroes going around the entire multiverse for every new adventure that comes their way, and the scale of the fights appropriately gets increasingly big and over-the-top along the way. Dragon Ball’s legacy and overall charm can’t be understated, and as such, it’s easy to see why it would stand out as one of the best adventure anime of all time.
