# Dragon Ball Super s Beerus Has a Hilarious Weakness to a Surprising Hero


## SUMMARY 



  Bulma has a secret weapon to stop Beerus - a candy that gives her control over someone&#39;s bowels.   Beerus loves Earth&#39;s food and regularly visits, making him an easy target for Bulma&#39;s candy.   If Bulma forces Beerus to have diarrhea, he will be too preoccupied to destroy Earth, making her the only one who can defeat him.

## Literature Review

While Goku has been able to channel the power of the gods, he is still no match for Lord Beerus, but one Z Fighter can succeed where Goku failed.




While Dragon Ball&#39;s Goku has unlocked god-like powers of his own, he still doesn’t stand a chance against Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction if the two were to ever fight again. There is, however, one classic Dragon Ball hero who actually could fend off Beerus with one ingenious attack. As silly as it might sound, Bulma actually has a better chance of stopping Beerus than Goku ever did.




Lord Beerus made his manga debut in Dragon Ball Super Chapter #1 by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou. In that chapter, Beerus has a vision of someone in his universe rising up and defeating him in battle–a mysterious fighter known as a Super Saiyan God. So, Beerus goes to Earth after tracking down two of the last remaining Saiyans in the universe, Goku and Vegeta. He hopes one of them is the Super Saiyan God who appeared in his vision so that he can crush them and put his anxieties at ease. After Goku unlocks the form of Super Saiyan God, he fights Beerus and is soundly defeated. This eased Beerus’ worries greatly, though it seems he should have been worried about an entirely different, and totally surprising, Dragon Ball hero instead.


 Bulma is The Only Dragon Ball Hero Who Can Stop Beerus 
          

In chapter #7 of the original Dragon Ball, Bulma, Goku, and Oolong are traveling the world searching for the Dragon Balls. While Goku and Bulma began this journey together, the two picked up Oolong along the way, as Bulma believed his shapeshifting would come in handy. However, Oolong was secretly plotting his escape, because he didn’t want to be involved with these two adventurers who so recently ended his villainous reign over a small town. Before Oolong decided to make a run for it, Bulma gave him a piece of candy which Oolong unthinkingly consumed. When Oolong tried to make his escape, Bulma uttered the phrase &#34;Pii Pii,&#34; and Oolong instantly came down with a case of violent diarrhea which stopped him in his tracks.




The candy Bulma gave Oolong was of her own design, and once eaten by someone, basically grants Bulma full control over their bowels for a fairly long period of time. Fans of Dragon Ball Super know that, ever since Beerus first visited Earth to fight Goku, he has continued to return in order to eat the delicious food Bulma prepares for him. While Beerus greatly enjoys his cosmic duty, there is nothing in the cosmos he loves more than food, especially when it’s from Earth. If there ever comes a time when Beerus threatens to destroy the Earth once again, all Bulma would have to do is feed Beerus the candy she gave Oolong, which he would assuredly eat without question. If she says &#34;Pii Pii&#34; this would force Beerus to relieve his bowels and return to his homeworld in a hurry to take care of his embarrassing situation.

While Lord Beerus is a god, his attention span is incredibly short, so if Bulma used her diarrhea-inducing candy to make him flee before he destroyed the Earth, it is likely he wouldn’t remember wanting to destroy it. If Goku tried to fight Beerus again in an effort to save the world, Beerus would destroy him and the Earth without breaking a sweat. However, if he was forced to leave in a hurry as he would if Bulma gave him her special candy, then the Earth would be saved–meaning Bulma, not Goku, is the only Dragon Ball fighter who can beat Beerus.
