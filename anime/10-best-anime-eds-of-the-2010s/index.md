 10  &#34;Climber&#34; by Galileo Galilei - Haikyu!! 


While all the Haikyu!! endings are iconic, the third ending, featuring &#34;Climber&#34; by Galileo Galilei, stands out for several different reasons. For one, this ending is evocative of the highs and lows of the series and how the series does a great job of maintaining tonal symmetry. The imagery throughout the ending continues to remind viewers of the journey that Karasuno is going through and nothing is a more powerful portrayal of their comeback than the final images that lingers at the very end. As always, the metaphors and iconography surroundings crows is beautifully done without being over the top.





 9  &#34;One Step  r&#34; by INTERSECTION - Fruits Basket 


Fruits Basket&#39;s second ending theme is a gorgeous and emotional tune accompanied by lovely stylized depictions of the various zodiac animals. The zodiac animals are set against an unmoving background, but there are moving elements that create even more visual intrigue; such as the panning camera and the movement of snow and rain falling, leaves and petals blowing, etc. The lyrics of the end theme feel as though they&#39;re meant to convey complicated emotions that, when coupled with the beautiful imagery of nature, feel very meditative. Like many of the options on this list, it&#39;s an ending that stirs the viewers&#39; hearts, sometimes in ways they might not be able to identify.





 8  &#34;Sonata&#34; by Clammbon - She and Her Cat -Everything Flows- 


For anime fans with pets, the ending theme for She and Her Cat -Everything Flows- will definitely tug on hearts strings. &#34;Sonata&#34; by Japanese music trio Clammbon is a moving accompaniment to the heartwarming visuals in this ending, which portray Miyu and Daru living their lives together throughout the years. The imagery is done in a style that feels reminiscent of watercolor paintings, which gives the overall appearance of these visuals as warm and fond memories. The lyrics highlight the warmth that Daru and Miyu bring to each other&#39;s lives, which makes this ending an engaging work of art, especially for individuals whose lives were made brighter by their animal companions.





 7  &#34;Yoru no Kuni&#34; by Annabel - Gangsta 


Gangsta&#39;s use of color in its opening and ending is striking and expressive – and one of the many reasons that its ending is worthy of praise. The ending theme, &#34;Yoru no Kuni&#34; by Argentine-Japanese singer Annabel, accompanies somber visuals with splashes of color of Gangsta&#39;s two main character, Nic and Worick. There are several standout moments, including one at the very end of song, which simply shows Nic signing the remaining lyrics as they&#39;re presented. Overall, the ending feels thoughtful and meditative, centering on the relationship between Nic and Worick, which also serves as a foundational component in the anime&#39;s story.





 6  &#34;Uraomote Fortune&#34; by Ari Ozawa - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun 


Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun&#39;s ending theme is the upbeat sounding &#34;Uraomote Fortune&#34; by Ari Ozawa, who also voices the protagonist Chiyo Sakura. Thematically, the lyrics seem to focus on Sakura and Nozaki&#39;s relationship – particularly on her infatuation with Nozaki, and being unaware of his feelings about her. This explains why a lot of the visuals appear more contemplative despite the cheery music. It&#39;s a charming ending that maintains the series&#39; tone and playful humor while focusing on more emotional aspects. It feels aptly shoujo in nature, reminding audiences that, at the end of the day, this series started with, and will continue forward because of, love.





 5  &#34;I Want You&#34; by Savage Garden - Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Part 4 


Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable&#39;s ending continues this list with bright and colorful visuals while being accompanied by &#34;I Want You&#34; by Australian pop duo Savage Garden. This ending takes audiences on a small tour of the season&#39;s setting, the town of Morioh, where more and more residents appear the further in the season viewers watch.
True to Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure as a whole, vibrant color combinations take the stage as viewers are guided through Morioh and iconic locations in the series. Naturally, as the season&#39;s protagonist and staunch protector of Morioh, Josuke makes several appearances throughout. While most of the characters are shown in the layout of Morioh, Josuke almost seems outside of it, like a watchful guardian, with the town and its people always in his heart.





 4  &#34;You Only Live Once&#34; by Wataru Hatano - Yuri On Ice 


 Yuri on Ice&#39;s ending song is &#34;You Only Live Once&#34; by Japanese singer Wataru Hatano and features visuals of the various characters around the world as though they&#39;re Instagram photos. Juxtaposed with this fun format are scenes of Yuri and Victor spending time together, including when they light off some sparklers. Not only is it fun for viewers to see the characters having a good time in the ending, but the scenes with the sparklers create some stunning visuals that follow through to the very end. Every second of the ending is delightful to watch and sure to bring a smile on fans&#39; faces.





 3  &#34;Hoshi wo Tadoreba&#34; by Yuiko Ōhara - Little Witch Academia 


 One of the many wonderful things about Little Witch Academia is its lovely art style, which is of course on full display in the anime&#39;s ending. The ending theme is called &#34;Hoshi wo Tadoreba&#34; by Japanese singer Yuiko Ōhara paired alongside this joyful anthem viewers are treated to pretty pastel colors and images of the Little Witch Academia cast going about their day. These adorable images are laid out before viewers almost as though they&#39;re reading from a storybook and discovering more about the everyday magical life of Akko and her friends. It&#39;s the perfect charming book end to every episode of this endearing series.





 2  &#34;Cause You&#39;re My Hero&#34; by LiSA - My Hero Academia 


 How can an anime ending that combines a popular shonen anime and classic fantasy elements not stand out? The third ending of My Hero Academia is a mini adventure that viewers are sure to enjoy from start to finish. The theme, &#34;Cause You&#39;re My Hero&#34; by LiSA takes viewers on a journey along with several characters from the series through a fantasy world that seems rife with danger and adventure. Watching the heroes team up against a wave of treacherous foes while representing what feels like traditional RPG classes is such a magnificent crossover that fans are unlikely to forget anytime soon.





 1  &#34;Memosepia&#34; by Sajou no Hana - Mob Psycho 100 


Mob Psycho 100&#39;s second ending stands out for the adorable art style and the upbeat tune that work together to create an ending which makes viewers smile. The tune is called &#34;Memosepia&#34; and is performed by Sajou no Hana, and its hopeful lyrics play alongside cute chibi-style animations of Shigeo going about his school life and spending time with friends and family. The ending is heartwarming, showing viewers all the relationships that Shigeo is forging throughout the series, the bonds that he makes which are clearly important to him. It&#39;s a reminder of the joy that viewers experience seeing how a character&#39;s life has changed from the beginning of a series and how much more possibility is out there in the world.
Anime endings feel like an extension of the series, which may share in a variety of qualities that the show itself has. They may remind audiences of the journey the show&#39;s characters have been on, place characters in a new setting, or simply show them living their day-to-day lives. Whether they&#39;re presenting a new chapter in the chronicles of a character&#39;s adventures or even serving as a meaningful synopsis, the best anime endings in the 2010s will stir up emotions within the hearts of fans.
