## Literature Review

The best anime dragons are all awe-inspiring creatures who prove why the dragon remains the world&#39;s most recognizable mythical creature.





With so many anime incorporating dragons in such a wide array of roles, it&#39;s easy to see that anime has expanded the definition of dragon. Anime dragons can act as many things in a story; they may be powerful destroyers, wise mentors on a hero&#39;s journey, or distant godlike beings to fulfill wishes. Their role in the plot is always memorable, and some dragons even rank among the best characters in anime history.









 








 15  Tohru - Miss Kobayashi&#39;s Dragon Maid 
        

Miss Kobayashi&#39;s Dragon Maid sees an overworked office worker named Kobayashi who one day finds herself employing a dragon named Tohru. Transforming herself into a human woman (albeit one with horns and a tail), Tohru offers her services as a maid to Kobayashi. Unfortunately for Kobayashi though, Tohru is often more trouble than she&#39;s worth as her mischievous personality often leads the duo into misadventures. Kobayashi might be one of anime&#39;s most unconventional dragons by most appearances, but she also ranks among the best.





 14  Bahamut - Rage of Bahamut 
        

Adapted from a popular mobile game of the same name, Rage of Bahamut follows three heroes on a quest to prevent the resurrection of the all-powerful Bahamut. Bahamut is a common figure in fantasy, due in large part to the massive dragon&#39;s inclusion in fantasy staples like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Final Fantasy where it is sometimes a force for good. Unfortunately for the world of Mistarcia, Rage of Bahamut&#39;s big dragon is a world-ending threat. In terms of raw power, few anime dragons can match Rage of Bahamut&#39;s titular menace.





 13  Masotan - Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan 
        

Perhaps one of the most unique anime dragons of all time, Dragon Pilot&#39;s Masotan is a combination of fighter jet and adorable dragon. Alongside his pilot Hisone, Masotan serves Japan&#39;s Air Force as an Organic Transformed Flyer, or OTF. Dragon riders are a staple of fantasy, but few riders steer their dragons from the inside like Hisone does. This fun series with a unique premise was criminally underrated when it was released. The dragon designs are all a lot of fun and lean more toward cute than scary. Dragon Pilot&#39;s Masotan might not be the most intimidating dragon, but he certainly ranks among the sweetest.





 12  War Greymon - Digimon Adventure 
        

Though some might associate War Greymon more with dinosaurs due to its evolutionary line, Digimon Adventure&#39;s War Greymon is a dragon through and through. The most iconic version of this digital dragon is easily his partnership with Tai in the original Digimon Adventure series. What makes that iteration of War Greymon so compelling is his growth into a dragon, as fans get to see Agumon grow in power as his bond with Tai grows stronger. War Greymon might lose rank for not being immediately recognizable as a dragon, but he&#39;s still one of anime&#39;s best dragons for his character growth.





 11  Dragonite - Pokémon 
        

Dragonite is a relatively new addition to Ash Ketchum&#39;s team. Yet, the orange goofball has quickly become one of Ash&#39;s strongest Pokémon and a memorable character who steals every scene. Thanks to its warm personality and considerable power, Dragonite cemented its place as a fan favorite. The dragon currently remains undefeated. Dragonite might not be the wisest anime dragon; it doesn&#39;t talk or offer advice to the young Trainer, however, it is one of the smartest dragon-type Pokémon, with many Pokédex entries describing its &#34;human-like intelligence.&#34;





 10  Ryūkotsusei - Inuyasha 
        

Years before the evens of the Inuyasha, Ryūkotsusei was a feared Daiyōkai that terrified the land. Inuyasha&#39;s father, Tōga, fought and defeated the dragon, sealing him in a state of dormancy. Two hundred years later, Inuyasha&#39;s arch-enemy, Naraku, helps Ryūkotsusei come back to life, and the dragon engages in a fierce battle against Inuyasha.
Ryūkotsusei is overconfident, vain, cruel, and ruthless. He only cares about destruction and constantly looks for worthier opponents to fight and entertain himself. He believes himself invincible and considers everyone to be beneath him. As far as anime dragons go, Ryūkotsusei is one of the most memorable, a villain whose imposing and terrifying appearance lives up to its fearsome reputation.





 9  Kaido - One Piece 
        

When Kaido, renowned as One Piece&#39;s Strongest Creature, ate the Fish-Fish Fruit he transformed into a serpentine Azure Dragon. As a human-dragon hybrid, he becomes massive, with thick and durable blue scales covering his entire body. In this new form, Kaido becomes even more dangerous. He breathes fire, creates clouds that allow him to move through the air, releases sharp blades by blowing, and creates lightning with his roar.

Anime dragons can be worthy and imposing enemies, and Kaido is the perfect example. Kaido was already ruthless enough as a human, but he became even more dangerous as a dragon. Over time, he achieves control over his draconic abilities, to the point where he can access them without needing to transform. Kaido&#39;s dragon form is so powerful that he&#39;s beaten Luffy within an inch of his life on more than one occasion.





 8  Hyōrinmaru - Bleach 
        

Hyōrinmaru is the manifested spirit of Tōshirō Hitsugaya Zanpakutō, one of the most likable characters in the Bleach anime. When Hitsugaya was a child, Hyōrinmaru frequently appeared as a serpentine ice dragon in his dreams. During the Thousand-Year Blood War arc, Hitsugaya loses his Bankai and ability to communicate with Hyōrinmaru. Once he recovers it, Hyōrinmaru returns to him. Anime dragons are usually depicted as larger-than-life and imposing, but Hyōrinmaru definitely looks mightier and more menacing than others of its kind. Thanks to its wings, thick legs, and overall muscular frame, Hyōrinmaru blows other anime dragons out of the water.





 7  Igneel - Fairy Tail 
        

Known as the Fire Dragon King, Igneel is the foster father of Natsu Dragneel. He is a loving, protective, and caring father figure, even after leaving his foster child. After Acnologia&#39;s Dragon Slaying Magic leaves him badly wounded, he seals his soul inside Natsu to recuperate. Igneel goes through a complex and compelling journey. He starts as an arrogant dragon, indifferent to human beings and their existence. Through Natsu, he grows to understand and care for humans, to the point where the dragon Metalicana describes Igneel as the dragon who loved humans more than any other. Igneel is thus the perfect example of the ally trope that befalls most anime dragons, acting as a loving mentor and guide to the story&#39;s protagonist.





 6  Blue Dragon - Blue Dragon 
        

Based on the 2066 video game of the same name, Blue Dragon tells the story of Shu, a young boy who received the power to turn his shadow into a monster. As a Shadow Wielder, Shu&#39;s monster is the indomitable Blue Dragon. At first, their relationship is hostile, with the beast unwilling to obey Shu&#39;s commands. He is also quite insulting of the boy, and though they eventually learn to work together, Blue Dragon remains critical of Shu&#39;s actions.
Blue Dragon is arrogant and selfish, cold, and sometimes cruel, although he does care about Shu&#39;s well-being. Some anime dragons assume an overly antagonistic attitude towards the human protagonists, mainly because they consider them lesser beings. Indeed, dragons often have fantastical abilities, which make most humans pale in comparison.





 5  Fredrika - Chaika: The Coffin Princess 
        

Fredrika makes sporadic appearances throughout Chaika: The Coffin Princess. She does not have a consistent form and instead takes several different ones. During the war, she adopted the form of a white-horned dragon and kept bringing it back whenever it was time to fight. Fredrika is intelligent but still very much a predator who enjoys stalking her prey, especially during battle. Anime dragons are mostly fearsome, even when they&#39;re allies. The dragon figure commands respect, so it makes sense that they often act as either brave warriors in battle or fearsome enemies capable of destroying entire armies.





 4  Acnologia - Fairy Tail 
        

Described as a cataclysmically powerful Dragon Slayer, Acnologia is the ruthless antagonist of the Fairy Tail anime. He bathed in the blood of the dragons he killed, allowing him to transform into a dragon at will. Although he begins his story by having a close relationship with dragons, he grows to resent them after one murders his family.

Bloodthirsty and violent, both in human and in dragon form, Acnologia is a terrifying being. He holds nothing but hatred and contempt for humans and dragons alike and won&#39;t stop at anything until he kills every last dragon. As far as anime dragons go, Acnologia might be the evilest and vilest, infamous for his cruelty and bloodlust.





 3  Blue-Eyes White Dragon - Yu-Gi-Oh! 
        

The powerful Blue-Eyes White Dragon is inarguably one of Yu-Gi-Oh&#39;s most iconic monsters, and that&#39;s for good reason. Not only is Blue-Eyes closely tied to fan-favorite character Kaiba, it also plays a pivotal role in more than a few battles throughout the series. More than just a one-trick pony though, Blue-Eyes&#39; ability to iterate and evolve makes it an interesting dragon. From the almighty Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to the visually impressive Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon, few anime dragons have as many incredible variants as Blue-Eyes does, instantly marking it as one of anime&#39;s very best.





 2  Haku - Spirited Away 
        

Widely considered one of the best movies of all time, Spirited Away centers on Chihiro, a ten-year-old girl who enters the world of Kami. When a witch named Yubaba magicks her parents into pigs, Chihiro must find a way to free her parents and return to the human world. One of the most memorable characters in the movie is Haku. First appearing as a young boy, he is actually a lost river spirit in the form of a white dragon. Haku is under Yubaba&#39;s spell and forgets his name, meaning he can&#39;t leave the spirit world. Haku is, without a doubt, one of the most famous anime dragons in history, and with good reason. He is an instantly recognizable figure crucial to the story and perfectly represents almost every archetype of the anime dragon.





 1  Shenron - Dragon Ball 
        

Arguably the most iconic anime dragon, Shenron is the mythical and almighty being summoned by the Dragon Balls. Shenron is a magnificent, serpentine floating green dragon capable of granting three wishes to those who gather all seven Dragon Balls. Shenron might be one of the most intelligent characters in Dragon Ball, but he&#39;s also a truly neutral being, granting any wish within his power without caring if it&#39;s &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad.&#34; Although he maintains his stoic personality during most of his appearances, he does show some degree of desperation, particularly with frivolous wishes. For example, he memorably berates Yamcha for wanting to wish for a necklace.
As long as there are fantastical tales, there will be dragons, and that&#39;s certainly true with anime. Though dragons in anime vary wildly, they&#39;re almost all mighty creatures who demand a certain level of respect and awe. When an anime depicts a dragon correctly, it truly lives up to its mythical status and makes viewers understand why this creature has popped up across so many different societies. The best anime dragons are all emblematic of why this mythological beast has captured the imaginations of so many different people.
