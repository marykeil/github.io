# Jujutsu Kaisen Why The Anime Cut Itadoris Love Interest


## SUMMARY 



  Romance takes a backseat in Jujutsu Kaisen, with Season 1 omitting Yuji Itadori&#39;s love interest, Yuko, to focus on the main plot.   Yuko is introduced as Itadori&#39;s classmate with feelings for him, but her role is small and she doesn&#39;t confess her feelings.   While romance may not play a major role, Jujutsu Kaisen stands out for its action and nuanced portrayal of female characters, challenging genre norms.

## Literature Review

Despite positing Yuji Itadori as a well-fleshed-out protagonist, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 1 cut his sole love interest, Yuko Ozawa. Here&#39;s why. 




Romance isn&#39;t a major element in the action-packed world of Jujutsu Kaisen, especially in the coming-of-age arc of protagonist Yuji Itadori, which is why a particular character was cut from Season 1. As most of the first season is centered upon the plan to postpone Yuji’s death sentence until all of Ryomen Sukuna’s fingers are consumed, the show understandably didn&#39;t touch upon Itadori’s love interest at the same point as the manga.




Much of Itadori’s character development in season 1 centered around him adhering to the philosophy of “the value of life,” one that allows him to gauge his connections with those around him. Yuji is visibly affected by the emotional weight of his grandfather&#39;s final words, which urge him to actively help those around him before it is too late for him to do so.

          

After his enrollment in Tokyo Jujutsu High, Itadori developed a plethora of skills, along with the exceedingly rare ability to contain Sukuna’s soul within his mortal body, which understandably comes at a hefty cost. Hence, due to the nature of the show’, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s first season completely omitted Itadori’s only love interest, Yuko Ozawa.


 Yuko Is a Small But Memorable Character in Jujutsu Kaisen 
          




In the original manga, Yuko was introduced before the Gojo&#39;s Past arc as Itadori&#39;s classmate while they were in junior high school. While Yuko harbored feelings for Yuji, she decided she would not reveal them, though she did muster up the courage to ask to take a photo together on their graduation day. In chapter 64 of the original Jujutsu Kaisen manga, when Itadori and Yuko again meet up, she finally decides to reveal the true nature of her feelings. Ultimately though, she isn&#39;t able to confess. This scene occurs in the anime much later than in the manga.

Despite playing a small role, Yuko’s presence is interesting, as she is posited as Itadori’s only love interest. Apart from bringing intricate characters and breathtaking action sequences to life, Jujutsu Kaisen is well-loved for the nuanced portrayal of its female characters, as epitomized in the Kyoto Goodwill Event Arc, wherein characters such as Maki Zenin emerge as nuanced and powerful in their portrayal as formidable jujutsu sorcerers. Keeping this in mind, it will be interesting to witness the possible ways in which romance can factor into the narrative as a whole, along with whether Itadori’s potential love interest will be fleshed out in a meaningful manner.






 Will Yuko Be Important in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Future? 
          

While the anime did eventually include Yuko in Season 2, her omission from the first season does raise the question of how important Yuko is in Jujutsu Kaisen. Maybe when the series concludes, Yuko will reconnect with Yuji and settle down with him, but given the current intense fighting of the manga&#39;s final arc, it is unlikely she will serve a major role in the story beyond that. Even if she never appears again that would ultimately be fine as her brief scene with Yuji served its purpose beautifully. By establishing a fun calm before the storm of the Shibuya Incident, Jujutsu Kaisen deepened the many tragedies of that arc.

Ultimately, Jujutsu Kaisen is a series focused more on action than romance. This hasn&#39;t stopped other modern Shonen series like Chainsaw Man from exploring that topic a bit, but Akutami has generally avoided the subject. However, irrespective of whether romance is in the cards for Yuji, Jujutsu Kaisen has managed to revolutionize the Shonen genre by challenging and subverting established genre norms and formulas.
