## Literature Review

An exclusive Pokémon only seen in the anime so far has finally had its identity confirmed, tying it to a name familiar to fans of Scarlet and Violet.




Warning: Spoilers for Pokémon Horizons Episode 24The mysterious Pokémon which has only been seen in Pokémon Horizons has finally been given a name: Terapagos. This reveal confirms the crystalline turtle Pokémon&#39;s connection to the series&#39; newest legendary, although the nature of the reveal still leaves a few questions about exactly what the deal is with this version of Terapagos.




The crystalline turtle Pokémon first appeared in the series&#39; second episode, as Liko&#39;s pendant transformed into Terapagos to protect her from an incoming stray attack. Until episode 23, the Pokémon had returned to being a pendant, only coming out once more when the team encountered the Titan Arboliva that once belonged to the Ancient Adventurer Lucius. However, after making contact with Lucius&#39; Galarian Moltres, the turtle Pokémon did not revert to being a pendant, and instead remained as a Pokémon, making it much more difficult to conceal its presence from the Explorers, who are after it for unknown reasons.


 The New Pokémon is Indeed Terapagos 
          

After Liko, Roy, and Friede managed to make it to Liko&#39;s grandmother&#39;s castle, they showed the Pokémon to her, which she immediately recognized by its face as Terapagos. However, Liko&#39;s grandmother notes that this seems to be a different form than the one she&#39;s familiar with, and confirms its connection to Lucius. In a flashback, Liko&#39;s grandmother is shown paging through a diary belonging to Lucius, which has a picture of the form of Terapagos shown in association with Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. That confirms Liko&#39;s grandmother knows what she&#39;s talking about, but there are still some mysteries with this new form.




According to information released in relation to Scarlet and Violet, this is Terapagos&#39; standard state, known as its &#34;normal form,&#34; and the massive, regal-looking version shown in the DLC is a special Terastal form. How these forms are related still isn&#39;t known exactly; the Terastal form may only be active when it Terastallizes, but that would almost certainly mean this form of Terapagos would be locked to Scarlet and Violet forever, as later games are unlike to feature Terastallization. It&#39;s always possible Terapagos could have form changes triggered by items or other conditions, like many other Legendary Pokémon do, which would prevent it from being locked in such a way.



 The Pokémon Anime May Reveal More About Terapagos 
          

Fans have believed that this Pokémon was related to Terapagos since it made its first appearance, but it&#39;s always good to have official confirmation, even if it seems like a sure thing from a fan&#39;s perspective. With the Indigo Disk DLC coming in just a few months, it&#39;s important for the anime to get its information about Terapagos out there ahead of the DLC, lest it somehow spoil events in the anime which have yet to unfold. Now that Terapagos is 100% confirmed as the new Pokémon, perhaps fans can look forward to seeing its elegant Terastal form in the anime soon as well.
