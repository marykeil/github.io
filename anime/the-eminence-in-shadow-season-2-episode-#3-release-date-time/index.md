## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #3 will hopefully escalate the stakes of the current arc after the explosive ending to Episode #2.

It will be simulcast on HIDIVE on October 18 at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:30 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened in The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #2? 
          

Episode #2 featured the most important characters of the arc all entering the vampires&#39; central tower and engaging in various fights against the undead. Mary and Claire received the most focus after they encountered Beta and some other members of Shadow Garden doing research in the tower, leading to an intense conversation. After this, the two encountered the brutal Juggernaut who nearly killed them before Shadow intervened and quickly left to ransack the vampires&#39; treasures. Injured, Mary revealed that she was a vampire fighting to stop the resurrection of her former queen. This resurrection was about to take place at the end of the episode before Cid disrupted the ceremony with an atomic strike.






 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #3 Will Force Cid to Get Creative 
          

Beginning his fight with the final boss was Cid&#39;s ultimate goal in the vampire tower, but his preemptive strike may have ended that battle before it began. Now there are essentially three possibilities for what Cid could do next. The simplest is if the resurrection ritual was already far enough underway to revive the vampire queen, in which case Cid would have to fight a being who was able to be revived even through an atomic attack. If she hasn&#39;t been revived, however, Cid could always complete the ritual himself creating his own final boss to battle. Lastly, he could also decide to focus on eradicating the mob of vampires swarming through the Lawless City instead of facing one singular foe.

Each of these options comes with its pros and cons. Of course, given how unpredictable The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s hero is he could easily do something that no one could expect, defying all fan theories. However, no matter what Cid does, if episode #3 maintains the same level of quality that The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 has displayed thus far, it is sure to deliver on both its action scenes and its humor.
