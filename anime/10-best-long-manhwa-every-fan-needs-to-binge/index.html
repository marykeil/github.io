<p>When magical gates suddenly appeared in the world, allowing dangerous otherworldly beasts to emerge from dungeons, ordinary humans received extraordinary powers to combat this threat and clear the dungeons. Despite being one of the fortunate people to have received such an ability, Jin-U Seong is known as one of the weakest hunters, having no choice but to struggle in low-level gates to support himself and his mother. But after nearly losing his life in a dungeon, Jin-U receives an unexpected quest, becoming the chosen Player of the System.
