 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 2? 
          

Undead Unluck episode #2, “Union”, picked up where the premiere left off with Andy trying to get Fuko to sleep with him to trigger enough Unluck to kill him. Andy dropped it when Fuko revealed that her Unluck was dependent on how much affection she had for someone, so his focus then became on preparing Fuko for the arrival of the Union, a secret organization of Negators—people like Fuko and Andy who negated the rules of the world—who would kill or imprison them to maintain order. Sure enough, two Negators from the Union named Shen and Void soon arrived to apprehend them, forcing Andy to take them both on.




During the fight, Fuko and Andy learned that the Union wouldn’t hurt them if they joined their ranks, and as such, they needed to create two openings on the Union’s roundtable. Andy created one opening by killing Void, but Shen’s Negator ability proved to be too much for Andy to handle. Shen, however, appeared to have grown fond of the two of them, and rather than take them in, he decided to send them to Russia to try and kill another Union member so there would be two spots for both Fuko and Andy.



 Undead Unluck Is Already Showing Off How Great Its Power System Is 
          

Undead Unluck episode #2 provided the first look at the series’ unique power system, and it’s already being shown to be a great one. Andy’s Undead already showed how creative a seemingly simplistic ability like immortality could be utilized, and with Void’s Unavoidable and Shen’s Negator ability, the complexities of its power system and the variety in fight scenes that come from how the characters are forced to act within it can shine even better. Undead Unluck’s Negator power system offers a great deal of variety for its fights, and episode #3 onward will undoubtedly bring that out even further.




Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #3 when it premieres on Friday, October 20.
