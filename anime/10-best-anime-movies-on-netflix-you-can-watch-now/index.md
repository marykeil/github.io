 10  The End Of Evangelion Is Famously Horrifying 
Studio Gainax


 







In an alternate take on Evangelion&#39;s ending, Third Impact begins as SEELE and NERV fight over the fate of the world, but they aren’t the ones who will make the final decision: it’s Shinji Ikari, currently immobilized by the trauma he’s suffered throughout the show. Ultimately, Shinji must either accept life for all that it is and summon the will to move on, or succumb to despair and take all of humanity with him.
This movie serves as the alternate finale to one of the most influential anime of all time, Neon Genesis Evangelion. Many fans consider it the true ending for following through on the character arcs set up throughout the show. Though the show’s finale is notably surreal in its concluding exploration of Evangelion’s psychological themes, End of Evangelion takes this up to eleven in its third act.

 9  Flavors Of Youth Is A Comforting Slice Of Life 
CoMix Wave Films/Haoliners Animation League
        

2018’s Flavors of Youth is a shared production between the Japanese CoMix and Chinese Haoliners. This slice-of-life anime anthology film centers around the basic needs of living beings: namely food, clothing, and shelter. A short and sweet 75 minutes, Flavors of Youth is split into three short films about each need and what they mean to the protagonists.
All three shorts take place across China. Through the centuries, young people step into adulthood the same way, uncertain and fearful. However, they are grounded by the simple loves and pleasures from their childhood — a bowl of noodles from Grandma, the gift of a handmade dress, a cassette tape made by an old friend — and given the confidence to move forward.

 6  The Witcher: Nightmare Of The Wolf Is The Show’s Anime Companion 
Studio Mir, based on The Witcher novels by Andrzej Sapkowski
        

Geralt is an infamously powerful witcher, but even he had to learn from someone. This prequel film tells the story of Geralt’s mentor Vesemir. In his boyhood, Vesemir sought to become a witcher for wealth and glory. But decades later, he discovers that not only does his kingdom detest him for what he is, but that the entire witcher system is irreparably corrupted.
While the television show is live-action, The Witcher’s showrunner, Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, insisted that Nightmare of the Wolf could only be animated. For a standalone story, it was the best way to bring the Witcher’s fantasy and horror to life. Helming the production was director Kwang Il Han, who was an animator on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Legend of Korra, and The Death of Superman. The series is well-animated and might scratch an itch for anime fans in need of a little epic fantasy.

 1  Adam By Eve: A Live In Animation Is Surreal And Beautiful 
Khara


This may be one of the most unique anime movies available on Netflix. The Biblical legend of Adam and Eve — the first humans created by God who lived in paradise but were tricked into disobeying and were forever exiled for this transgression — is told through dialogue-less animation and music. Intriguing and surreal, it is more like a dream than a narrative film.
Clocking in at only 58 minutes long, this short film is directed by Hibiki Yoshizaki and Nobutaka Yoda, the latter of whom also wrote the screenplay. While it isn’t widely known, its fans enjoy it for the musical storytelling, beautiful animation, and the way it skillfully weaves some live-action sequences into the anime. These elements mean Adam By Eve is the best anime movie currently streaming on Netflix.
