## Literature Review

One Piece shows that Dr. Vegapunk may be far from the innocent apple-headed inventor everyone believes him to be, and there is actually evil in him.





Summary

  Vegapunk&#39;s true colors and personality are revealed in Chapter #1099 of One Piece, showing that he may not be as innocent as he appears.   Vegapunk exhibits greed and evilness when he tries to extort payment from Kuma by suggesting the creation of clones using his blood, showcasing his lack of morality and responsibility.   This incident highlights Vegapunk&#39;s lack of accountability for the destructive consequences of his inventions, like the Mother Flame, and suggests that he may be a more complex character than initially portrayed.  







One Piece has just revealed Vegapunk&#39;s true colors and personality, and he may not be as innocent as he seems. The latest chapter reveals a new side to Dr. Vegapunk that has until now gone unnoticed thanks to the existence of his various satellites and his personality traits being split among them. In fact, Vegapunk may truly be every bit the mad scientist he was believed to be before his official introduction on Egghead.

Chapter #1099 of One Piece explores Vegapunk&#39;s devious nature as he tries to extort payment from Kuma in exchange for healing Bonney of her illness. Vegapunk displays characteristics of York and Lilith&#39;s personalities as he suggests that Kuma allow him to create clones using his unique Buccaneer blood as payment instead, well aware that he has no money.

          




Vegapunk&#39;s choice to exploit Kuma&#39;s weakness for his own benefit and for the sake of innovation comes as quite a shock given his holier-than-thou behavior in the present. Having said that, this incident draws attention to Vegapunk&#39;s lack of morality or responsibility when it comes to scientific progress and how his inventions are used.

 Vegapunk Is Evil Because He Takes No Responsibility For His Inventions 
          

Chapter #1099 reveals Saint Saturn was listening in on the conversation between Vegapunk and Kuma and had every intention of turning Kuma&#39;s clones into the weapons of destruction that they later became. Many of Vegapunk&#39;s inventions, like the Seraphim, the Pacifista, and especially the Mother Flame, have wreaked extensive damage on the world of One Piece. However, Vegapunk seems to lack any accountability for the damage done. He seems blissfully unaware that his work is financed by the World Government, and thus his inventions are bound to be exploited for tyrannical purposes.




The Mother Flame alone was able to wipe out the existence of an entire island in mere moments. Although Vegapunk seems to be unaware of the destruction of Lulusia, given his approach to similar ethical concerns in the past, he likely would not bat an eye. Most notably, in Chapter #1067, when Jinbe raises concerns about Punk Records creating clashing ideologies if shared with the entire world, Dr. Vegapunk simply states that science would be unable to advance if held back by those kinds of worries. True to that, he is not worried about the use that the World Government will make of his invincible cyborg soldiers.



 Dr. Vegapunk Personifies The Risks Of Science Without Morals 
          

Thus, Vegapunk is the personification of the risks of &#34;unbound scientific progress&#34;, a common theme in sci-fi literature and a pressing concern in the real world. Overall, while he isn&#39;t entirely the cliché evil scientist, Vegapunk is surely far from innocent, despite his unassuming, grandfatherly appearance. More importantly, this incident with Kuma is further proof that Vegapunk does indeed possess the personality traits of his satellites, including York&#39;s greed and Lilith&#39;s evilness. As such, Vegapunk may be a far more complex character than One Piece initially let on.
