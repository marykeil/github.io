## Literature Review

In DBZ, Majin Buu wielded a power that was absolutely terrifying, but somehow, that ability was topped by a horrifying villain in Dragon Ball GT. 




While Majin Buu is perhaps the most terrifying villain in the entire Dragon Ball mythos given his god-tier strength, his near invulnerability, and his mysterious origin, there is another villain that was introduced in Dragon Ball GT who is arguably even scarier, and it’s all because of one power that is seemingly an upgraded version of Buu’s most terrifying ability.




After Majin Buu became the deadliest creature on Planet Earth during DBZ&#39;s Majin Buu Saga, he forced the hands of Goku and Vegeta to use the Potara Earrings to fuse into Vegito. During the subsequent battle Majin Buu and Vegito, Buu turns Vegito into chocolate, and Vegito shockingly becomes even deadlier. Up until that point in the fight, Vegito could barely land a punch on Majin Buu, but the second he was turned into chocolate, Vegito was like a living bullet, shooting through Buu and inflicting massive amounts of damage while taking none in return.

         

It got so bad, that Buu actually turned Vegito back into a Saiyan again, as he couldn’t take the abuse. This proves that, even though Buu has the horrific ability to turn people into chocolate, they still have a chance to fight back, even in that form - though the same cannot be said for a similar power used by a villain in Dragon Ball GT.




                  Goku Vs Vegeta: Who Won More Of Their Dragon Ball Battles?   Vegeta and Goku have had a total of five serious fights throughout every era of Dragon Ball, and out of those five fights, only one came out on top.    


 Dragon Ball GT&#39;s Lord Luud Has A Scarier Version of Buu&#39;s &#39;Chocolate Power&#39; 
          

In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 11 (written by Masashi Kubota, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), Pan and Gill (the newly-sentient Dragon Radar) find themselves on a strange world run by a villainous cult after following Gill’s signal which indicated there was a Dragon Ball somewhere on the planet.

Once Pan discovers that the Dragon Ball is inside the cult’s temple, Gill refuses to follow her for fear of what was inside the cursed place. However, Pan rushes right into the temple to get the Dragon Ball as she wasn’t afraid of any potential dangers, though Pan quickly realizes she should have been.






 Lord Luud&#39;s Victims Are Truly Helpless, Unlike Majin Buu&#39;s 
          

When Pan enters the temple (which is owned and operated by the Luud Cult) she is zapped by two beams of energy emitted from the eyes of the statue of Lord Luud–the ‘God of Destruction’ these cultists follow. After she is zapped, Pan is suddenly transformed into a powerless doll that falls to the floor, unable to move on her own. What’s even more disturbing is that Pan is totally cognizant the entire time, as her mind is trapped in a useless body with the threat of death looming over her. This power exhibited by Lord Luud is very similar to Buu’s ability to turn people into food, primarily chocolate, though Luud&#39;s victims are much more helpless than those of Majin Buu.

When Lord Luud turns someone into a doll, they have no chance of fighting back at all. As chocolate, Vegito was able to continue his battle against Majin Buu, and even proved to be more effective as chocolate, proving that Dragon Ball GT has a much scarier version of Majin Buu’s most disturbing Dragon Ball power.
