## Literature Review

There&#39;s no need to pay for a streaming service to watch some classic anime. Here are 10 of the best anime you can stream right now for free.





Some of the following series are only available dubbed, while others are only available subbed. The rights for streaming subs and dubs can be different, so often times there&#39;s only one or the other available on these free streaming services. As a result, many of the following series are only available in subtitled form. Still, no matter what dubbing preference one has, there&#39;s free anime out there that can satisfy.









 








 10  Naruto 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV, Tubi
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
The original Naruto anime follows Naruto Uzumaki, a young boy who dreams of becoming the best ninja in the land. Both blessed and cursed with the power of a nine-tailed beast, Naruto has been an outcast for most of his life, but soon is given the chance to prove his worth, teaming up with Sakura and Sasuke in ninja training. Note that this is the original anime, not Naruto Shippuden, but that&#39;s still over 200 episodes worth of content available completely free. One of the big hit series of the 2000s, it&#39;s never too late to check out Naruto, or even just have a look for old time&#39;s sake.





 9  Lupin the Third 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Lupin the Third is a classic anime series that has been running since 1971, all the way to the present day. Lupin the Third follows master thief Lupin and his comrades Jigen and Goemon as they attempt to steal precious objects from around the world, making a spectacle of their magnificent heists, all while avoiding the dogged detective Zenigata. Lupin the Third is separated into several parts, with the first part dating back to 1971 and part 5 having aired in 2018, but it&#39;s not necessary to watch every part to follow what&#39;s going on. Lupin is a cultural phenomenon in Japan thanks to its longevity, so any anime fan worth their salt should have a little familiarity with it.





 8  Yu-Gi-Oh! 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV, RetroCrush, Tubi
Subbed or Dubbed?: Dubbed
Another hit series from the early 2000&#39;s, Yu-Gi-Oh! tells the story of Yugi, a young boy who finds an Egyptian puzzle and solves it, which causes him to take on the alter ego Yami Yugi, or Dark Yugi. The series revolves around a card game known as Duel Monsters, which Yugi happens to be quite talented at playing. When the creator of the card game uses another Egyptian artifact to take Yugi&#39;s grandfather&#39;s soul, Yugi must fight his way through the Duelist Kingdom to free his grandfather. The version available to stream is the original 4Kids dub, making it an excellent blast from the past for anyone who watched the series as a kid.





 7  Sailor Moon 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Sailor Moon is one of the most famous anime of all time, and a classic of the 90s. It follows Usagi Tsukino, a young girl who finds out that she&#39;s got a magical destiny before her as the illustrious Sailor Moon. Usagi later meets up with Sailor Scouts representing other planets throughout the solar system, each with their own special powers and abilities, who come to her aid to battle the villainous Queen Beryl and other villains. The original Japanese version is a bit different from the 90s dub by DIC, and fans who haven&#39;t watched it with subtitles will get a kick out of the various changes. For those looking for a more modern series, PlutoTV also has the recent Sailor Moon Crystal.





 6  Yu Yu Hakusho 
        

Streaming on: Tubi
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Yu Yu Hakusho is an excellent shonen anime from the 90s, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, also known for Hunter X Hunter. It follows Yusuke Yurameshi, a young boy who dies in a car accident and is enlisted as a &#34;spirit detective&#34; in exchange for another shot at life. While it starts off rather small, things escalate quite a lot over the course of the series. Yu Yu Hakusho is well known for its incredible tournament arcs, which feature some very cool battle anime action. Fans of Hunter X Hunter who&#39;ve never checked out Yu Yu Hakusho are in for a real treat, as many of the features which make Hunter so interesting are clearly present in Yu Yu Hakusho.





 5  Galaxy Express 999 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Galaxy Express 999 is a 1978-1981 anime series, making it older than most on this list, but its status as an influential classic can&#39;t be ignored. The series follows a young boy, Tetsuro Hoshino, who lives in poverty on Earth until he gets the chance to board the Galaxy Express and see the stars. He&#39;s accompanied by a woman named Maetel, who looks a lot like his deceased mother, and comes from a planet very far away, at the end of the Galaxy Express line. Despite its looks, the series&#39; storytelling is very mature, and deals with heavy topics that go over the head of its young child protagonist. This is one series that shouldn&#39;t be missed by hardcore anime fans.





 4  Inuyasha 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Inuyasha is yet another classic anime from the turn of the millennium. It tells the story of Kagome Higurashi, a high school girl in Japan who is one day whisked away to the Feudal Era, where she meets the half-demon Inuyasha, who she found bound to a tree in stasis. Circumstances force the pair to work together to reconstruct the Shikon Jewel, which they accidentally destroyed while attempting to prevent it from being stolen. But Inuyasha&#39;s old enemies are also back, and they have plans for the Shikon Jewel as well.





 3  Death Note 
        

Streaming on: Tubi
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Death Note made a splash in the mid-2000s with its edgy premise, and became an instant classic. Light Yagami, a brilliant but otherwise ordinary high school boy, finds a mysterious notebook, which states that writing a name in this book will kill that person in whatever manner is described. After putting it to the test, Light resolves to use the Death Note to create a better world--only to immediately come into conflict with the police and their special detective, L. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game, as Light attempts to cover his trail, while L continually searches for this magical vigilante who believes he is above the law.





 2  Hunter X Hunter 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV, Tubi
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Another series by Yoshihiro Togashi of Yu Yu Hakusho, Hunter X Hunter is an incredibly popular series which received this animated adaptation back in 2011. It follows Gon, a young boy on a quest to find his father and become a Hunter, just like him. Becoming a Hunter is no easy task, though, and Gon makes friends with fellow aspiring hunters Kurapika, Killua, and Leorio, and they must work together to obtain their hunter licenses and achieve their dreams. The series is rather long, at over 150 episodes, and the manga it&#39;s based on still isn&#39;t finished, but Hunter X Hunter is widely regarded as one of the best anime of the 2010s.





 1  Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure 
        

Streaming on: PlutoTV, Tubi
Subbed or Dubbed?: Subbed
Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is a legendary series, with its manga running almost continuously since 1987. The series is unique in that it follows the Joestar family, rather than a single character, and shows their exploits across the centuries, dealing with everything from vampires to ghosts, and of course what the series is most famous for, the Stand, a spiritual manifestation of one&#39;s soul that&#39;s imbued with special powers. Parts 1-5 can be watched on PlutoTV and Tubi for free, but unfortunately part 6 (the most recent part to be animated) is currently exclusive to Netflix. Still, because of the ever-changing protagonists, there&#39;s no need to watch every single part of the story.
There are dozens more high quality anime series out there available to stream for free on these and other platforms, as well as countless anime movies, some of which even belong to these franchises, such as several Lupin the Third movies. Be sure to check out the libraries of content on these services for yourself and see if there&#39;s anything else that strikes your fancy. For those looking to watch some anime on the cheap, though, it&#39;s hard to do better than these 10 free anime series to stream.
