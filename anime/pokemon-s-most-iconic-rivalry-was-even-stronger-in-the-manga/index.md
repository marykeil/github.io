# Pokemon s Most Iconic Rivalry Was Even Stronger In The Manga


## SUMMARY 



  The rivalry between Red and Blue in the Pokémon manga is more compelling than Ash and Gary&#39;s rivalry in the anime early on.   Red and Blue&#39;s relationship is revealed and developed more quickly in the manga, while Ash and Gary&#39;s dynamic is elaborated on later in the series.   Red and Blue focus on their individual goals while still supporting and competing with each other, creating a stronger and more balanced rivalry than Ash and Gary&#39;s early rivalry.

## Literature Review

The Pokemon Adventures manga features a major rivalry between Red and Blue, its lead trainers. This rivalry starts off stronger than Ash &amp; Gary&#39;s. 




Ash and Gary in Pokémon have one of the best-known rivalries in anime. Pokémon Adventures, the franchise&#39;s manga, doesn&#39;t feature either, but instead focuses on their video game counterparts: Red and Blue. While Ash and Gary are great rivals, the manga competition was very different - and somewhat improved.




The first Pokémon game released in Japan in 1996, a year ahead of the manga and anime inspired by it. This game kicked off the successful franchise and set up these iconic rivalries. Both are compelling, but Red and Blue&#39;s rivalry in the manga was wholly based on skill and improvement over childhood competition. This is especially noticeable in Pokémon Adventures Vol. 1, which has the creative team of Hidenori Kusaka and Mato.


 Red &amp; Blue Have Quicker Development Than Ash &amp; Gary 
          

In the anime, Ash and Gary both grew up in Pallet Town. They were always competitive with one another, though their relationship is only elaborated on much later in the series. Its early beginnings and their mutual respect for one another were slow to be revealed. Instead, the show relied on a simple approach to their dynamic. Gary is arrogant and mocks Ash, while Ash is continually told about or compared with Gary and his achievements. The two dig at each other regularly, without truly facing off several times over, leaving fans to wonder who is stronger based solely on a lack of defining power struggles between them. Some of their dynamic isn&#39;t even revealed until Master Quest, the fifth season of the series.




                  Ash Has One Pokémon Rival So Much Crueler Than Gary   Many fans remember Gary&#39;s classic anime behavior and think of him as a jerk, but one of Ash&#39;s rivals went much farther than Gary ever did.   

Contrarily, Red and Blue did not grow up together. Blue is still the grandson of Professor Oak, but he was away at boarding school for some time. Upon his return to the region in the first chapter, he and Red run into each other in the woods as they both hear about a phantom Pokémon, revealed to be Mew. Neither knows the other and Red instantly notes Blue to be a Pokémon trainer. Their encounter with Mew is brief, but revealing as neither has the power to take it down. Blue is shown to be wiser in this situation, but the tables turn in another encounter soon after in chapter 3. Watching his rival battle against a Kangaskhan, Red notes that there is more to the fight than it seems - something Blue fails to realize.

As their journeys continue in the debut volume, both trainers are seeking similar goals. However, they aren&#39;t making fun of each other or basing their rivalry on childlike impulses. Instead, they save each other and look out for each other while still holding onto their competition, particularly in chapter 13, which takes place in Lavender Town. Red saves Blue, while Blue doesn&#39;t hesitate to let Red know the dangers of not paying attention. These two are undoubtedly trying to best each other, but they don&#39;t target each other the way Ash and Gary tend to. They focus on their independent tasks and work with each other or around each other when situations throw them together. Their clear story and mutual growth from the very beginning of the manga make Pokémon&#39;s Red and Blue a stronger rivalry when compared to Ash and Gary.
