# Boruto s Real Teacher During The Time Skip Explains Why He s So Powerful Now


## SUMMARY 



  Boruto has become the most powerful shinobi in the land of the Five Hidden Villages, even surpassing Naruto.   Boruto&#39;s training under Koji Kashin, a clone of Jiraiya, has greatly improved his abilities, including his newfound connection to toads and his use of Sage Mode.   Koji&#39;s influence is also evident in Boruto&#39;s demeanor, as he has become more serious and enigmatic, mirroring Koji himself.

## Literature Review

Boruto’s return to Konoha has shown him to be a much-improved shinobi, and this is due to his work under his father’s trainer - well sort of.




Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex #4While Boruto&#39;s return to Konoha Village was brief, it was enough to show that he is perhaps the most powerful shinobi in Konoha. It&#39;s a surprising upgrade to his abilities, even considering the three-year time skip. After a similar period of training in isolation, his father, Naruto, was greatly improved but not nearly as impressive as his son. The difference in powerups may just come down to mentors.




As detailed in Boruto: Naruto Next Generation Chapter #80, with the identities of Boruto and Kawaki being switched through Eida&#39;s Omnipotence powers - Boruto was labeled a traitor. With no other options, Boruto fled. Fortunately, Sarada Uchiha was not affected by Eida&#39;s charms, and convinced Sasuke of Boruto&#39;s innocence and that he should go along with him.

          

At the time, the idea of Boruto training under Sasuke in isolation seemed like the perfect solution. However, upon further consideration, while Sasuke might be powerful, he has little experience mentoring others, and his wandering ways made it unlikely he&#39;d be able to put the time in to effectively train Boruto. But recent events show a much different mentor had a hand in making Boruto such a powerhouse.





 Two Blue Vortex Implies Jiraiya&#39;s Clone, Koji Kashin, Trained Boruto 
          

The confidence with which Boruto returned to Konoha and the techniques he used to put down Code and his Claw Grimes strongly suggested that, rather than Sasuke, Boruto had been training under Koji Kashin. That idea was given major support in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter # 4. While Koji Kashin&#39;s return in Boruto is surprising, that he would facilitate Boruto&#39;s advancement to such a high degree is not. Koji was, in fact, a clone of Jiraiya. Like Sasuke, Jiraiya was one of the great shinobi of his generation. However, unlike Sasuke, one of his hidden talents was his ability to train others.

Koji&#39;s influence on Boruto is unmistakable. First, there are his newfound abilities. This is most obviously illustrated in the surprise appearance of the toads - a telltale sign of Koji. The use of toads derives from the &#34;blood contract&#34; Jiraiyi made with the toads on Mount Myoboku during his training with them. Koji - having the same blood as Jiraiya - inherited this ability, which he is now presumably using alongside Boruto.






 Koji Taught Boruto Jiraiya&#39;s Sage Mode Technique 
          

Then, there&#39;s evidence of Boruto&#39;s use of Sage Mode - an enhanced state of being that provides a massive power boost. Jiraiya was never able to fully master the mode, but Koji was - which means Boruto has a better chance of mastering it as well. So far, Boruto&#39;s Rasengan Uzuhiko suggests the young ninja has some of the prerequisites for obtaining Sage Mode as it requires the blending of natural energy with his own chakra energy, a key element of Sage Mode.

Koji&#39;s influence is also obvious in Boruto&#39;s demeanor. When readers last saw Boruto at the end of Part I, despite achieving a modicum of maturity, he still exhibited a healthy dollop of the entitled brat demeanor that comes from being the Hokage&#39;s son. Three years later, at the ripe age of 15, the cheeky bravado is gone. Instead, Boruto is noticeably more serious, direct, and solemn. That personality is not due to becoming a teenager. Rather, it mirrors that of Koji - who&#39;s now made Boruto as skilled and enigmatic as he once was.
