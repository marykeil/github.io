 What Happened In One Piece Episode #1082? 
          




Episode #1082 of One Piece starts off with the Straw Hats including Otama and Otoko peacefully enjoying the Fire Festival and trying their hand at the festival games. Meanwhile, the battle against Admiral Rokugyu rages on as Denjiro, Dogstorm, and Kawamatsu try their best against Rokugyu&#39;s overwhelming Logia powers. Even a fire-based attack from Raizo proves to be fruitless against Rokugyu as the latter simply puts out the flames and proceeds to drain the moisture from Raizo&#39;s body, leaving the ninja emaciated.

Elsewhere, Sukiyaki leads Robin and Law down a secret passageway where they discover the old Wano from 800 years ago at the bottom of the sea as well as another Road Poneglyph. The former shogun also reveals that Pluton does lie under Wano and can be accessed only by destroying the walls surrounding Wano.

          




Back on the surface, Momonosuke finally musters an attack against Rokugyu only for him to get back up. Fortunately, Shanks steps in and ends the battle by using his Conqueror&#39;s Haki to intimidate Rokugyu into fleeing. As the Red Hair Pirates depart, Luffy talks about a familiar face popping into his head.
