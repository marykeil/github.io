## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s story has seen Koby grow into a powerful Marine. However, a new untold backstory makes Luffy&#39;s rival more admired than thought possible.




Koby has become one of One Piece&#39;s most beloved characters as he&#39;s developed alongside Luffy, but a newly revealed backstory has made him even easier to love. Author Eiichiro Oda has habitually shared additional fascinating details about the One Piece world and its characters in each manga volume&#39;s Q &amp; A section (aka SBS). The Japanese release of Volume #107 of the One Piece manga reveals an incredible backstory featuring Koby and an epic battle the manga never covered that elevates the fan-favorite character to even greater heights.






Koby&#39;s more prominent role in the One Piece Live Action&#39;s first season has helped make him more popular than ever.




The Future Island arc has featured a surprising amount of stories not taking place on Vegapunk&#39;s Egghead Island. One such section included Garp and SWORD&#39;s dramatic rescue of Koby from Blackbeard&#39;s base on Hachinosu. One SWORD member equipped with a teddy bear and incredible sniper skills named Hibari was adamant about saving Koby, and thanks to the SBS in volume #107, readers now know why.


 

Thanks to a post on X by content creator and One Piece superfan Artur, a question regarding the teddy bear seen in Hibari&#39;s bag during Koby&#39;s rescue attempt has revealed a touching relationship between the two young SWORD members. The backstory explains why she secretly named the bear Koby-senpai, and the reason makes Luffy&#39;s rival more admirable than One Piece&#39;s Admirals.





 Koby&#39;s Actions Won Hibari&#39;s Heart &amp; Respect From One Piece Fans 
          

Each time Koby reappears in One Piece&#39;s story, he dramatically improves his abilities and standing among the Marines. Still, the manga didn&#39;t have time to cover the story of how he risked his life for a teddy bear. SBS #107 revealed that Hibari&#39;s teddy bear, seen during the rescue mission on Hachinosu, was a lucky charm she&#39;d cherished since childhood and that she lost it while being rescued by Koby in the middle of a warzone. After discovering how important the bear was to Hibari, Koby disappeared for a few days and eventually returned heavily injured with the bear in his possession. Since then, Hibari has looked at Koby much differently.

                  Live Action One Piece Confirms The Anime &amp; Manga Needed More Koby   Koby&#39;s prominent role in One Piece&#39;s live action confirms that the manga and anime made a big mistake in not focusing more on him.   




Koby&#39;s actions during the assault on Hachinosu further explored the level of strength he&#39;s gained under Garp&#39;s tutelage and how much the pink-haired Marine means to his fellow SWORD members. Hibari, Helmeppo, and even Vice Admiral Garp risked their lives to rescue Koby from one of the One Piece world&#39;s most dangerous places infested by wildly strong Devil Fruit using Pirates. The newly revealed backstory effectively heightens Koby&#39;s character. It proves that he is a person whose actions inspire those around him, much like Luffy, something that can not be said for the Marine&#39;s current leadership.



 Koby&#39;s Adventures Deserve To Be Animated 
          

It is incredibly rare to find a story whose world is so thoroughly detailed and filled with likable characters that the story itself can not cover due to time constraints. Oda&#39;s answers in One Piece&#39;s manga volumes have ranged from humorous gags to additional lore that further fascinates the series&#39; global fanbase. With the anime beginning to get frighteningly close to the manga&#39;s current content, One Piece could use an engaging filler arc to help Oda&#39;s manga pull ahead. Koby&#39;s quest to rescue Hibari&#39;s teddy bear in a warzone sounds like a filler arc One Piece fans should see.
