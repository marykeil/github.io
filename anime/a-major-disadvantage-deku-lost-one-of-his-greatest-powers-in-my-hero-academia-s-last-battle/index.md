## Literature Review

One quick touch has radically turned the tables in My Hero Academia&#39;s final battle, costing Deku a powerful ability that&#39;s now in Shigaraki&#39;s hands.





Summary

  Shigaraki successfully steals the Fourth User&#39;s Danger Sense, making Deku vulnerable and himself harder to hit.   Losing one Quirk makes it easier for Shigaraki to steal the entire One for All Quirk, putting Deku&#39;s life and the heroes&#39; hopes in danger.   Despite the loss, Deku improvises a new means of defense, but the battle is far from over.  







The unthinkable has occurred in My Hero Academia chapter 411, with Shigaraki successfully stealing his first piece of One for All. Unfortunately for Deku, the first of his powers to go is also one of the most useful: the Fourth User&#39;s Danger Sense, which had been critical to his success in the final battle so far.

While All for One may be gone for good, Shigaraki has still managed to achieve a part of his former master&#39;s dream, even if it&#39;s not a dream that he shared. That&#39;s a big enough moment on its own, but the scene isn&#39;t presented from the outside, but rather from within One for All&#39;s psychic realm, where a manifestation of Shigaraki&#39;s hand comes down and literally snatches one of the vestiges away, taking the Quirk factor with it.

          




Deku instantly loses the ability to sense incoming attacks and threats, and worse still, Shigaraki immediately gains that ability, making him that much harder to hit than he already was.

                  Genius My Hero Academia Twist Changes the Final Battle Completely   My Hero Academia just teased that Deku&#39;s final battle may be completely different than fans anticipated with one simple yet unexpected twist.   


 Losing One Quirk Could Be Just the Beginning 
          

One thing which Deku has relied on heavily is the fact that the combined willpower of the vestiges of previous One for All users has been enough to keep them from being stolen in close calls in the past. However, with one vestige now missing, the sum total of willpower within One for All is now lower than it once was, making it even easier for Shigaraki to try to steal the entire One for All Quirk next time. Even if that&#39;s not enough, he can continue picking off Quirks and vestiges one by one, until it gets to the point where he actually can steal One for All--at which time, the heroes&#39; hopes--and Deku&#39;s life--will come to an end.




Since Danger Sense was the first Quirk to go, it will be a lot easier for Shigaraki to land hits on Deku from here on out, increasing the risk of this nightmare scenario dramatically. Of all the Quirks within One for All, Danger Sense was almost certainly the worst one to lose first for this very reason. At the very least, Shigaraki isn&#39;t as accustomed to using Danger Sense as Deku is, and may not be able to respond to its warnings quite as quickly, but that&#39;s not much of a silver lining. This final battle just got a lot more difficult for Deku, and there&#39;s no reason to think this Quirk loss can be reversed.

Still, the battle between good and evil is far from over, and Deku has managed to improvise a new means of defending himself, albeit one that makes it much harder to retaliate. Shigaraki&#39;s sights also seem to be set on destruction at this point, rather than focusing on the battle itself, as he makes threats about his intention to destroy Mount Fuji next. The My Hero Academia world is more imperiled than it&#39;s ever been, and it&#39;s definitely going to take everything that Deku has in order to turn this fight around.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
