# Solo Leveling Took a Big Risk By Rejecting the Big New Anime Trend


## SUMMARY 



  Solo Leveling did not follow the recent anime trend of combining its first two episodes into one longer premiere to build up anticipation and captivate viewers from the start.   The first episode was slow-paced and mostly worried about setting up the story, while the second episode revealed the true potential of the series.   Episode 2 introduced captivating elements such as intense violence, unique consequences for failure, and a compelling transformation in the main character, making it a standout episode.

## Literature Review

Instead of following in the footsteps of Oshi no Ko and Frieren, Solo Leveling&#39;s prologue is split into one okay debut and one spectacular follow up.




Warning: Spoilers for Solo Leveling episode #2




The highly anticipated anime adaptation of Solo Leveling was able to get away with a slow-paced first episode, even though the following one was much better by comparison. The anime decided to not conform to a new trend, recently championed by hits Oshi no Ko and Frieren, series that have successfully debuted with a 40-minute-plus first episode to give themselves enough time to set up the story.

Sometimes translated as Only I Level Up, this adaptation of Chugong&#39;s South Korean web novel revolves around a weak &#34;hunter&#34;, a human with supernatural powers, named Sung Jinwoo, who gains the unique ability to level up. The first two episodes take place before that happens, which could have justified presenting them in one neat package.

          

The problem with splitting the prologue into two installments is that nothing in the first episode effectively demonstrates that Solo Leveling deserves its hype. It isn&#39;t until the exciting episode #2 of Solo Leveling that viewers finally realize why manhwa and web novel readers have been rightly excited about the adaptation.





 Solo Leveling Lives Up To The Hype Starting From Episode #2 
Produced by A-1 Pictures, based on the web novel by Chugong
          

Episode #1 gave viewers a weak hero wanting to prove himself - a common trope - whose party stumbles into a rare second boss room in a dungeon. That first death in the debut episode isn&#39;t enough to capture the attention of first-time viewers who are not already familiar with the story. The mystery that the premiere creates about the second boss is only fully explored in the following episode. In fact, the terrifying facial expression of the statue in episode #2 truly captivates viewers, especially since it shares the best qualities of Attack on Titan&#39;s iconic giants.

Episode #2 also shows the party suffering unique and brutal ramifications from failing to answer a deadly riddle, as opposed to just being killed. While graphic deaths are intense and frequent, they aren&#39;t even the highlight of the episode. The same can be said of the helplessness and eventual eroding of bravery among Jinwoo&#39;s more experienced party members. While episode #1 ends with everyone terrified, it pales in comparison to the trauma they sustain in episode #2.




          

Jinwoo&#39;s weakness and desire to expose himself to danger to provide for his family, seen in the first episode, is also just another bland retelling of a clichÃ© situation. More interestingly, Jinwoo later adopts an unprecedentedly realistic and understandable mindset in his final moments that shatters his original &#34;good boy&#34; persona. He becomes resentful of his situation and even condemns those who abandoned him. This not only makes Jinwoo a more controversial character, but sets up a desire in the viewer for him to somehow avenge himself.

Clearly, the second episode has many other captivating elements when compared to the series&#39; debut. That ,and the fact that the latest installment ends right when the real story begins, serve as further proof that the two episodes should have perhaps been combined into one truly memorable premiere. Of course, Solo Leveling &#39;s success proves that the series got away with not adhering to the latest anime trend, and that&#39;s what matters.
