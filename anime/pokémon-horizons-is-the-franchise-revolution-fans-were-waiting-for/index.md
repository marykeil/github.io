## Literature Review

With its first arc now complete, 2023&#39;s new series Pokémon Horizons has proven to be a revolutionary new direction for the classic franchise.




The new series Pokémon Horizons marks the first time in the show&#39;s 25-year history that it has focused on a protagonist other than Ash Ketchum, and while it was hard to say goodbye to one of anime&#39;s most iconic characters, the new direction taken by the franchise has reinvigorated the anime in a way that fans had been waiting for a long time.




Announced together with Ash Ketchum&#39;s official departure from the show, Pokémon Horizons represented the first major change in the anime since its inception in 1997. While there have been other anime projects featuring protagonists other than Ash (such as the Mega Evolution Specials, or Pokémon Origins), these had all been short-term miniseries, with the ever-popular Ash remaining safely as the primary protagonist of the main series. After Ash achieved his dream of becoming world champion, though, it seemed it was time for the series to move and finally let a new hero take the reins.


 Pokémon Horizons Proved It Was Different From The First Episode 
         

Pokémon Horizons debuted in Japan in April 2023, and follows two protagonists: Liko, a young girl in possession of a mysterious pendant, and Roy, a young boy with an ancient and intricate Poké Ball that won&#39;t open. The series kicked off with an action-packed premiere, introducing the new villains (known as the Explorers), who were after Liko&#39;s pendant for reasons unknown. Liko is rescued by a group known as the Rising Volt Tacklers, led by the roguish professor Friede and his right-hand Pokémon, Captain Pikachu. By the end of the first two episodes, it was already apparent that this was a very different series from its predecessor.






Pokémon Horizons has announced an English dub for 2023, but it has not yet been released at the time of writing.




The first and most obvious change, aside from the characters themselves, is that this iteration of the Pokémon anime is far more story-driven than it was under Ash. Ash Ketchum tended to wander slowly from town to town, getting into mischief and adventures along the way, hounded by Team Rocket. The only overarching story was Ash&#39;s quest to defeat the local gyms and enter the tournament at the end, which did its job of keeping the series running but was otherwise not very compelling, at least until the tournaments actually started. Pokémon Horizons has at its core a mystery revolving around the ancient adventurer Lucius, and unraveling that mystery is what drives the plot forward, rather than a vague desire to be the best.

Another major change is the way that Pokémon Horizons treats its villains. Team Rocket was the nominal main villain of the series under Ash, but Team Rocket quickly became a joke, and any fan who was paying attention soon realized that they&#39;d never be able to achieve their goal of stealing Pikachu. By completely removing the possibility of the villains succeeding, much of the tension is lost, and Team Rocket is used this way in almost every episode. The Explorers, on the other hand, have been used more sparingly, and the heroes&#39; lack of experience puts them at a major disadvantage against more skilled trainers like Amethio. The Explorers have also been more villainous in general, using Pokémon in nefarious ways to achieve their goals that would make Team Rocket pause.






 Pokémon Horizons&#39; New Heroes Are A Perfect Fit 
          

As protagonists, Liko and Roy still have much of what made Ash so popular. Liko&#39;s kindness and love for all Pokémon is much like Ash&#39;s, while the fiery fighting spirit has instead passed to Roy. Splitting these traits into two characters has given them a sort of yin-and-yang relationship, covering for each other&#39;s flaws and helping each other as needed. Liko has also had to deal with shyness and insecurity in a way that Ash never did, which makes her struggles all the more compelling to follow. Even in just the first arc, Liko has grown to a more confident person, showing a level of character development that would take Ash a hundred episodes or more to develop.

Of course, Pokémon Horizons&#39; greatest asset over the original series with Ash is its extended cast. With the series set primarily aboard an airship, Pokémon Horizons has given Liko and Roy a whole cast of adult characters whom they can rely upon when the going gets tough. These adult characters like Friede have even had some time in the spotlight already, and it turns out that having supporting characters around as regulars is a very positive change for the series. Additionally, having adult characters gives older fans someone to relate to, and adds a new dimension to the series&#39; storytelling.




Pokémon Horizons has also been wise not to do away with adventure-of-the-week stories entirely, even in the face of its new dedication to long-term storytelling. The series often takes a few episodes after major plot points to breathe, offering the kind of slice-of-life adventures that Ash had without significantly slowing the story down. These episodes allow viewers to get to know the characters better, and give Liko and Roy the opportunity to catch new Pokémon just like Ash did. Adventure-of-the-week episodes also tend to introduce elements from the games that fans like to see, such as gym leaders, rivals (Nemona makes an appearance, for example), and even mechanics such as picnics.



 Pokémon Horizons Is A Successor With Its Own Identity 
          

None of this is to say that the anime as it was with Ash was bad. However, Pokémon Horizons has set itself apart by being a very different kind of anime. While many fans have been sad to see Ash go after all these years, those who&#39;ve approached Horizons with an open mind have found the new series to be just as entertaining to watch, if not more so. Fans even still get their weekly dose of Pikachu through Captain Pikachu, who has proven to be a different sort of character from Ash&#39;s Pikachu while retaining his most lovable qualities. The change to a story-driven formula could also win over new fans who weren&#39;t so fond of Ash&#39;s slower-paced style.




As fans patiently wait for an official English release, Pokémon Horizons has made it clear that it managed to revolutionize and anime series that has been going for more than 25 years, while staying true to its roots and remaining the kind of show with a little something for everyone, and the franchise is all the better off for it.
