## Literature Review

Call of the Night became popular with manga fans for mixing romcom writing with vampire action, and the series is now heading towards its conclusion.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Call of the Night chapter #192.Call of the Night is a romcom manga centered around Nazuna Nanakusa, a vampire who lives for the nightlife, and Ko Yamori, a boy who wants to fall in love with Nazuna so he can become a vampire. The series is unique for exploring what it actually means to fall in love, and with its stellar action scenes and character drama, it’s cultivated a sizeable fanbase over the years.




Call of the Night has established itself as a one-of-a-kind romcom anime and manga over the past four years, but now it’s officially coming to an end. With the publication of chapter #192, it was officially announced that Call of the Night would end with chapter #200, meaning that the series should end sometime in January 2024.

          

That only leaves a few chapters for the series to conclude its few remaining plot threads, but with how well Call of the Night handles executing story beats with fast pacing, it’s sure to end its story on an organic and satisfying note.

 Call Of The Night’s Final Story Explained 
          

With Call of the Night coming to an end, that means there are only a few chapters left to close out its final story: the story of Ko and Nazuna officially becoming a couple. After going through one tribulation after another, including the death of Ko’s best friend, Ko and Nazuna finally acknowledge their feelings and become a couple, but that’s not without its issues. Since they now know that a vampire dies if they suck the blood of someone they love, Nazuna can’t turn Ko into a vampire, so there’s only so much time for them to be together as a couple before Ko ultimately grows old and dies.

Ko, for the most part, is fine with not becoming a vampire since he still gets to be with Nazuna, but there are still problems to be had. Nazuna doesn’t want to suck anyone other than Ko’s blood, but since doing so would kill her, she’s forcing herself to go without blood and has become increasingly weak as a result. Noticing this, Haruka, Nazuna’s surrogate brother, decides to kill Ko so Nazuna will move on and suck other people&#39;s blood, and the fight between them, and however it leads to helping Nazuna, is bound to be what the last stage of Call of the Night will be centered around.



 Call Of The Night Still Has To Resolve Its Biggest Mystery 
          

Beyond closing out Ko and Nazuna’s relationship, there’s one other mystery that Call of the Night needs to resolve before it ends: the whereabouts of Nazuna’s mother, Haru Nanakusa. Many of the mysteries in the series have revolved around Haru’s actions, most notably how she was able to give birth to Nazuna and why she disappeared immediately after doing so, but there has yet to be an answer to any of it. With Call of the Night set to end in a few chapters, there’s only so much time left to close the book on Haru Nanakusa, so the story needs to do so as soon as possible.

Conversely, the series can end without resolving anything involving Haru. Nazuna and other characters have progressed to the point where they don’t need Haru to be part of their lives, so while it might be disappointing for the audience, it would make sense for the characters to not try and figure out what happened to her and instead focus on resolving things between Ko and Nazuna. It’s still unknown how things will play out in Call of the Night’s final story, but with any luck, it’ll do so in a way that resolves things in as satisfying a way as possible.
