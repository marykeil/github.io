# Pikachu Proved His True Power In His REAL First Pokémon Gym Battle


## SUMMARY 



  The manga Pokémon Adventures introduces new characters and battles that differ from the anime, including changes to iconic moments.   While in the anime Ash willingly decided to use Pikachu in his first gym battle against Brock, despite the type disadvantage, in the manga Red had no other choice due to limited options, creating a stronger bond between him and Pikachu.   Red and Pikachu showcase determination and the ability to capture victory, surpassing their anime counterparts in terms of bonding and early success.

## Literature Review

Ash has been known to choose type-disadvantaged Pokemon in his battles, starting from his first Gym, but his manga counterpart had an even worse time.




The gym battles in Pokémon are some of the most exciting parts of the franchise, and Pikachu&#39;s battles in the anime have always been particularly exciting. The manga Pokémon Adventures expands on the lore of the fantasy world, adding new characters and battles for fans to enjoy. Particularly noteworthy is how gym leaders and iconic match-ups differ from page to television.




Pokémon Adventures has the creative team of Hidenori Kusaka and Mato. It details the adventures of trainers not seen in the anime, who are inspired by the game. These include Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, sharing their names with some of the video games that kickstarted the franchise. In addition to changing the main character lineup, the manga also changes some of the anime&#39;s most iconic early moments.


 


 Red&#39;s Battle Against Brock Was A Lot Harder Than Ash&#39;s 
Pikachu was the only option Red had for his first gym.
          

In the fourth chapter of Pokémon Adventures, titled &#34;Wanted: Pikachu,&#34; Red enters Pewter City and immediately catches a Pikachu. Having battled it with his Bulbasaur and with his Poliwhirl low on health, the young trainer seeks out the Pokémon Center. However, when he arrives, he finds a notice indicating its temporary closure due to vandalism. When preparing to challenge Brock, the gym leader, he is left with only one option: fighting with his brand-new Pikachu. This is a major change from the well-known anime, which features Pikachu as Ash&#39;s starter Pokémon.




The manga thus shift this scenario from a trainer choosing their strongest Pokémon to battle, in spite of the type disadvantage, to one who only has that option available. It seems like a small change, but it completely alters the trajectory of Red and Pikachu&#39;s friendship, besides showing why the protagonist would make such a bizarre change and battle with a type disadvantage. In the manga, Pewter City&#39;s gym has a specific window that allows for challenges. If the window closes, Red will miss his opportunity to get his badge and keep up with his rival. Contrarily, gyms in the anime are shown to be open whenever a gym leader agrees to a battle, whether it be day or night. Ash had several options to fight Brock, including being offered Misty&#39;s water Pokémon.



 Red And Pikachu Are A Power Duo In Pokémon Adventures 
          




Contrary to what happens in the anime, Pikachu does not need any weird power-up with an electric plant or the water sprinkles to go off in the gym. Red&#39;s Pikachu does emerge victorious and the duo come out of the battle with a much stronger bond. This alternate version of a trainer&#39;s battle against Brock highlights the potential that Red and his team have. When given no alternative, both Pikachu and Red rise to the test and pass it despite their rocky start together. This trainer&#39;s ability to bond with his Pokémon rivals Ash&#39;s, but Pikachu &#39;s performance in Pokémon Adventures puts the anime&#39;s counterpart to shame when it comes to determination and the ability to capture victory.

Pokémon Adventures is available from Viz Media.
