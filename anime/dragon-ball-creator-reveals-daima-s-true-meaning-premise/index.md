## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Daima&#39;s announcement also revealed Akira Toriyama&#39;s close involvement in the new anime, via a personal message from the manga author.





The NYCC panel revealed that Toriyama helped design the characters, plot, and even the settings for the upcoming anime. While Goku being miniaturized has happened before (in Dragon Ball GT), Toriyama&#39;s involvement shows that Daima will be a lot more connected to the original manga and perhaps even its current sequel, Dragon Ball Super. It is appropriate, considering the anime will celebrate the franchise&#39;s 40-year anniversary.





 

Dragon Ball Daima will premiere in 2024. Following a &#34;conspiracy&#34; from a new, mysterious villain, not just Goku but the entire cast of Dragon Ball are turned back into kids. The heroes will then have to travel to another world to solve the crisis, which sounds incredibly exciting.

Akira Toriyama&#39;s message was first displayed on screen at the Dragon Ball Daima reveal at Comic Con, but has since become available on the Toei Animation X account. The message goes into detail about the word &#34;Daima&#34;, noting that it is a made-up Japanese tern that in English would translate as &#34;Evil&#34;. Toriyama also confirms the upcoming anime&#39;s premise, where Goku and others have to go on a quest into a new world to regain their original ages. The message also highlighted the return of Goku&#39;s Nyoibo (Power Pole), which he will have to use to make up for his small size, something that fans have not seen since the original Dragon Ball series.




During the panel, executive producer Akio Iyoku stated that Toriyama was &#34;deeply involved&#34; with Daima, to the point that he &#34;planned entirely new episodes for the storyline&#34;. As an anniversary project, it is no surprise that all hands are on deck to ensure the success of the show. The premise that Goku and the others are reverted to kids, along with the other revealed details, shows how much the new anime wishes to be a callback to the style and story of the first manga, which had far more obvious references to Journey to the West.

          

Toriyama&#39;s involvement is often considered vital to a Dragon Ball installment â€“ GT&#39;s tepid reception is sometimes ascribed to the author&#39;s limited contributions beyond some character designs. Fans clearly have nothing to worry about if the new setting and even some episodes are personally handled by the author. The return of the Power Pole is also a great way to help differentiate a franchise known best for energy blasts and ground-shattering punches. By returning to its roots, Dragon Ball Daima may be perfect to attract new viewers but it will also give older fans the nostalgia feeling they crave.
