## Literature Review

In honor of its 25th anniversary, Google has revealed the most searched anime for the past half decade.




To celebrate its 25th anniversary, Google just revealed the most searched anime since its founding is Naruto as opposed to Dragon Ball or One Piece. The topic of the most popular anime is probably the most discussed one in the anime community, with different fandoms presenting conflicting arguments. And now, Google has officially confirmed that Naruto has won this debate.




Naruto being Google&#39;s most searched anime was revealed in a fun little interactive map put out by Google called Most Searched Playground. Although Google searches aren&#39;t the only metric to measure popularity, it is a good indicator, especially when the sample ranges for over 2 decades. It also backs up other statistics that show that Masashi Kishimoto&#39;s hit series is indeed the most famous anime.


 

The iconic ninja series was always at the center of discussion alongside other members of the Big Three, One Piece, and Bleach, but a confirmation from the giant company puts the series above all others and proves that Naruto is the most popular anime of all time.

                  30 Best Anime Series of All Time, Ranked   Anime has exploded in popularity recently, so it&#39;s natural to wonder what series in the medium&#39;s history rank among the best of the best.

Coupled with other statistics, Naruto is the obvious choice for the most popular anime of all time. According to MangaCodex&#39;s list of manga sales, Naruto is the 5th best-selling manga of all time, with more than 250 million copies in circulation worldwide. The anime is even more popular, with Crunchyroll declaring it as the most watched on the platform from 2010 to 2019. Crunchyroll writer even went so as saying &#34;There’s a phrase we use a lot around the office–“Crunchyroll is the house that Naruto built”&#34; The numbers have always pointed to Naruto being the global icon of anime, and Google&#39;s latest data further confirms it.

With 700 episodes and 700 chapters, Naruto follows the orphaned and ostracized troublemaker Naruto. His goal is to become the Hokage, the most powerful and highest-ranking in the village, and his journey is one of the most inspiring. Besides being an example of shonen done right, what makes Naruto stand out is how gripping the stories of the cast can get. Naruto deals with a lot of tough real-world issues such as genocide, betrayal, and friendships, constantly making the viewer challenge their way of thinking.

Naruto is perhaps the most iconic anime of all time, so it makes sense that it would be the most searched anime series of all time. It managed to beat giants like Attack On Titan, which was the most searched series for the past 3 years, and other genre-defining anime such as My Hero Academia and Slam Dunk. Even more impressive is its victory over massive series that have sold more manga volumes than it, like Dragon Ball and One Piece. This is truly an impressive feat considering the show ended more than 5 years ago, and it is still as popular as it ever was. Naruto is truly a timeless series and has well-earned its spot as Google&#39;s most-searched anime.
