## Literature Review

Whether they are idol groups or otherwise, these anime bands made memorable soundtracks that fans continue to listen to long after the final episode.




The importance of music in anime cannot be understated. From the well-known opening and ending songs that fans immediately associate with their favorite titles, to the soundtracks playing in the background to set the mood just right, music plays a vital role in enhancing one&#39;s experience and enjoyment of a show. However, when it comes to the best anime musical bands, music is not just a tangential concept, but their whole focus.
Anime revolving around musical bands tend to fall into one of two categories. The most obvious would be idol-oriented shows, where the entire story follows the origin, development, and path to stardom of a group of singers aiming to become famous idols, each for their own reasons. As for titles that are completely unrelated to the idea of idols, they typically focus less on the importance of spectacular performances and entertaining fans, and more on the essence of music as a way to express oneself and connect with others.
