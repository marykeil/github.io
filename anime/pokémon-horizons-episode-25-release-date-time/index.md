## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons episode 25 sees a climactic battle with the Explorers break out at Liko&#39;s Grandmother&#39;s castle. Here&#39;s how to tune in and watch.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          




New episodes of Pokémon Horizons air on Fridays at 6:55 PM JST, only on the network TVTokyo. 6:55 PM JST translates to 2:55 AM on the West Coast of the US, and 5:55 AM on the East Coast, an inconvenient timeframe to say the least. Episode #25 is set to air on October 20, 2023. At present, these broadcasts are only intended for Japanese audiences, and as such lack subtitles, making knowledge of Japanese necessary to watch live. Pokémon Horizons will be receiving an English dub, currently set to debut in late 2023, but no more specific date is available at present.



 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #24? 
          

Episode #24 of Pokémon Horizons saw Liko, Roy, and Friede arrive in Hammerlocke, on a quest to track down Liko&#39;s Grandmother, Diana. They find Diana and her castle after being led through a secret passage, and she welcomes them inside. As they explain the situation with the pendant and how it has transformed into a Pokémon, Diana identifies the mysterious Pokémon as Terapagos, although she notes it&#39;s a form she&#39;s not familiar with. Before she can relay more information, however, her castle comes under attack from Amethio of the Explorers, who hopes to get his hands on Terapagos and redeem himself in the eyes of his employers.






 Pokémon Horizons Episode #25 Marks The End Of The First Arc 
          

The battle between Friede and Amethio will commence in episode #25, as the former fights to protect Liko and Terapagos from the latter. Liko and Roy initially flee, but this isn&#39;t a situation that can be solved by running away, so they&#39;ll have to put what they&#39;ve learned from Kabu and others to the test. This episode is rumored to be the last of the &#34;Liko and Roy Set Off&#34; arc, the official name for this introductory arc of Pokémon Horizons. What that will entail isn&#39;t exactly clear, but the story will definitely be moving into a new phase as the team&#39;s goal changes from merely keeping the pendant safe to solving the mysteries that surround it.

With a new arc rapidly approaching, it&#39;s an exciting time for Pokémon Horizons, and the story could go in a variety of different ways from here. Hopefully, the promised battle between Friede and Amethio will be an eventful one, as it seems to be the centerpiece of this coming episode. This is also an opportunity for Liko and Roy to take a step forward as the protagonists of the series, proving that they&#39;re learning and growing as they adventure around the globe with the Rising Volt Tacklers. With such enemies on their tail, it&#39;s important for Pokémon Horizons&#39; heroes to show that they&#39;re capable of handling themselves, no matter what&#39;s thrown at them in the upcoming episodes.
