## Literature Review

The final two episodes of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War&#39;s second cour are coming. Here&#39;s everything a fan needs to know to tune into the finale.




The finale of this batch of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War episodes is here at last, promising an epic confrontation between Squad Zero and Yhwach&#39;s elites. Here&#39;s everything a fan needs to know in order to tune in and watch these episodes at the earliest possible opportunity.





 When Do Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Episodes Release? 
          

In the US, new episodes of Bleach are currently premiering on Hulu, while in much of the rest of the world, these episodes are instead found on Disney Plus. New episodes are uploaded at 7:30 AM Pacific Time/10:30 AM Eastern Time on Saturdays on Hulu. Presumably, both episodes 25 and 26 will go live at the same time, which should be on September 30, 2023. Dubbed episodes also premiere on Saturdays, although the dub is currently about three weeks behind the subtitled release. If you can&#39;t watch the episodes as soon as they go live, that&#39;s perfectly okay, as they will continue to be available to stream indefinitely after the initial release.



 What Happened in Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Episode #24? 
          




The showdown between Yhwach and his elite soldiers and Squad Zero got off to a solid start in episode #24, and featured a fair amount of new material that wasn&#39;t in the manga, as well as some big cuts. The episode opened with a new flashback to negotiations between Squad Zero and Yhwach in the distant past, hinting at Yhwach&#39;s true motives for the first time. Squad Zero&#39;s Senjumaru Shutara battled against Sternritter W, Nianzol Weizol, and defeated him with ease. Squad Zero even deployed a fake Soul King Palace in order to attempt to trap Yhwach, but this failed due to Uryu helping him to escape. Squad Zero is still facing down Yhwach&#39;s elites, though, as Yhwach himself stares down Ichibe Hyosube, Squad Zero&#39;s leader.



 Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Episode #25/#26 Will Put Yhwach to the Test 
          

It&#39;s difficult to say what exactly will be in episodes #25 and #26, as the previous episode made heavy use of new material not from the manga, while also cutting some fights (such as Kirinji&#39;s). Squad Zero will surely be battling against Yhwach&#39;s elite soldiers, who, while trapped, are still plenty dangerous. Ichigo and his friends are likely to arrive at the Soul King&#39;s Palace at some point in there as well, ready to provide back-up to Squad Zero and stop Yhwach in his tracks. Yhwach has only just begun his true plans, though, and he&#39;s not about to be defeated so easily. Will Ichigo&#39;s new powers be enough to end this?




The second cour of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has been an incredible and action packed journey, giving many characters their chance to shine. While it&#39;s known that a third and fourth cour of episodes are on the way, a release window for the next batch has yet to be announced. Based on the pacing of the series thus far, fans can expect the third and fourth cours to contain a significant amount of new content, even moreso than what this second cour provided. For now, though, fans still have Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War&#39;s second two-part finale to enjoy, and it&#39;s bound to feature some incredible fights.
