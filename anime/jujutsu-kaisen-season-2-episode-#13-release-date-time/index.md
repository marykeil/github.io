## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #13 is guaranteed to feature some awesome fights between various sorcerers and curses like Yuji and Choso.




After a lot of fighting, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s latest episode ended on a great cliffhanger and hopefully Season 2 Episode #13 will give it a satisfying resolution. Based on how great the show&#39;s latest fights have been, this is almost guaranteed. In addition, a lot of manga readers have justifiably high expectations of this next fight so that Studio MAPPA may go all out for this next battle.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode #12 Releases 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #13 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, October 19. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 19 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #12? 
          

Episode #12 checked in on various characters present in Shibuya who haven&#39;t yet been given time to shine. Most notable of these is Nanami who begins the episode coming across the bodies of the assistant directors. The episode also focuses on Nobara and Nitta who encounter a disturbed sorcerer who gives them some trouble until Nanami shows up and brutally takes him down. Meanwhile, Mei Mei encounters the main villain of the arc &#34;Geto&#34; who releases a dangerous Smallpox Curse that attacks her. The episode ends leaving that battle unresolved and showing Yuji encountering Choso, who immediately unleashes an attack on him, initiating yet another fight.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #13 Will Accelerate The Pace 
          

Given both Mei Mei and Yuji are now engaged in fights, episode #13 is almost guaranteed to focus on these battles. Both of these clashes will likely push the protagonists to their limit as they each face a special grade curse. In addition to these fights, the popular villain Toji is now back and seems to be itching for fights against Jujutsu sorcerers. This means that he may also engage some of the protagonists in a fight, potentially even clashing with his own son Megumi. All of this isn&#39;t even counting the various disaster Curses who were absent in episode #12 like Mahito and Jogo who are currently scouring Shibuya for Yuji but likely wouldn&#39;t hesitate to fight any other sorcerer who gets in their way.

The rest of the Shibuya Incident seems like it will have a lot of awesome fights based on how episodes #11 and #12 went. If these fights live up to the standard set by something like Gojo vs the Special Grade curses, which happened right before he got sealed, then this nonstop action could make the Shibuya Incident one of the best Shonen arcs of all time. Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #13 will be a good barometer for how well MAPPA will handle the rest of the season and whether the fights will be done as much justice as they deserve.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #13 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 19, 2023.
