## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s Fire Fist Ace swoons fans once again in stunning new fan art with his signature sunny smile that&#39;s worth melting for.




One Piece&#39;s fan-favorite older brother, Ace, has become the ultimate thirst trap in new fan art, reminding fans once again of their old heartbreak. While One Piece has its fair share of attractive characters, both male and female alike, this illustration proves why Ace is among the series&#39; most popular characters.




Shared on X, this fan art posted by @_Dm_0820 features Ace smiling brightly holding up Luffy&#39;s bounty poster. Ace can be seen in his signature hat and beaded necklace from the series, seated at a table with empty bowls stacked up around him. The art captures every aspect of Ace that fans know and love, from his bright sunny smile to the endearing freckles that make up his signature charm.


 

Besides swooning fans with Ace&#39;s well-known good looks, the art also reminds fans of what could have been had Ace survived the war at Marineford and lived to witness Luffy&#39;s journey.

                  One Piece Outdoes Ace&#39;s Death In New Most Tragic Twist   One Piece surpassed the tragic death of Ace with an even more tragic twist shown in Kuma&#39;s traumatic flashback.   





 One Piece&#39;s Ace Swoons Fans In New Fan Art 
          

In this fan art, Ace can be seen holding up Luffy&#39;s bounty poster and smiling proudly while pointing to it. Ace has been known to have followed Luffy&#39;s journey closely from the start, even telling Yamato to keep an eye out for Luffy when in Wano and talking all night about his younger brother. Interestingly, the bounty poster in Ace&#39;s hand features Luffy&#39;s 1.5 billion bounty issued after the events of Whole Cake Island and adds a touch of sadness to the otherwise sunny illustration by reminding fans of how proud Ace would have been to see Luffy take on an Emperor of the sea and later become one himself.

Tragic details aside, this fan art highlights all of Ace&#39;s best features, from his long wavy hair that catches the sunlight to the playful freckles on his nose and cheeks like his mother Rouge. The rendering also captures Ace&#39;s thirst-worthy physique, with his muscular build in clear view, as often seen in the series as well, where Ace often goes shirtless.




                  One Piece Gets Its Own Cart Racer in Ridiculously Fun New Art   One Piece fan art is pitting the Straw Hat Pirates against one another in a friendly cart race, putting the crew in a fiercely fun new battle.   

​​​​



 Ace&#39;s Adventure Was Far from Over 
          

Overall, it would be an understatement to say that Ace died much before his time and would surely have achieved far greater things had he lived. Not only did Ace miss the chance to witness Luffy and the Straw Hats&#39; immense growth, but he also completely missed the chance to reunite with Sabo who only regained his memories after the events of Marineford. Even though Ace&#39;s death was arguably necessary for Luffy&#39;s character development, his death still remains one of the most heartbreaking moments in One Piece and fans can&#39;t help but wish things had gone differently, especially when reminded of Ace through artworks like @_Dm_0820&#39;s.
