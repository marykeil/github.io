## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons has a new villainous team for its heroes to contend with, but they&#39;re shrouded in mystery. Here&#39;s what we know about the Explorers.





The Explorers are first introduced in the first two episodes of Horizons, trying to claim protagonist Liko&#39;s pendant for themselves. The team is shown to be highly competent, executing a complex infiltration at first, then using Liko as leverage when Friede and the Rising Volt Tacklers get involved. The first Explorer that&#39;s introduced is Amethio, a young man with half-black, half-white hair whose partner is the new Paldean Pokémon Ceruledge. He&#39;s also shown to be accompanied by two subordinates, the kind typically referred to in the games as &#34;Grunts,&#34; who are named Zirc and Onia.





 The Explorers Are a New Kind of Pokémon Villain 
          

The first thing to realize about the Explorers is that they are decidedly not like Team Rocket. While Team Rocket appeared in nearly every episode of the original Pokémon anime under Ash, the Explorers have only appeared in a few of the episodes so far, and have sent different agents after Liko, rather than just sending the same team over and over again. They have much more reliable technology at their disposal than Team Rocket ever did, including a submarine which Amethio had been using to follow the Rising Volt Tacklers&#39; airship. In episode #6, Amethio was shown to be just one of many agents of the Explorers, and another of these agents, Spinel, has also gone after Liko.

Spinel was especially devious as a villain: he utilized the commonplace Pokémon Magneton to create electromagnetic interference around the airship, cutting off their transmissions and isolating the crew. When he actually made contact with Liko, Spinel didn&#39;t hesitate to use his Pokémon&#39;s hypnosis ability to mess with Liko&#39;s mind and steal her pendant that way. Spinel also kept to the shadows, battling with Friede remotely via a small transmitter he used to give his Pokémon orders. While Spinel was ultimately defeated, he came incredibly close to succeeding, and there&#39;s no reason his methods wouldn&#39;t be valid again in the future.






 Who Are the Explorers? 
          

The Explorers are led by a man named Gibeon, who has yet to make his appearance in the anime. Like Team Rocket&#39;s Giovanni, he communicates with his followers remotely, and they seem to have an extensive base of operations. His second in command is a man named Hamber, who dresses like he&#39;s Gibeon&#39;s butler. When Amethio failed to obtain the pendant, Gibeon had no problem taking him off the case and assigning Spinel in his place. Aside from Amethio and Spinel, there are three other known &#34;Admins&#34; (to borrow another term from the games): Agate, Onyx (whose name is likely to change in the dub to avoid overlapping with the famous Rock-type Pokémon), and Sango. All members of the Explorers have a name themed around gemstones.

Gibeon and the Explorers have yet to spell out their intentions and motivations, instead doggedly chasing down the airship wherever it goes. They&#39;re primarily after Liko&#39;s pendant, which has been shown to have protective abilities, the capacity to turn into a mysterious Pokémon, and react to the Ancient Poké Balls, like the one Roy had. Their interest in the pendant suggests that they might be after the Pokémon in these Ancient Poké Balls, which are all said to belong to the strongest Pokémon trainer in history, an ancient adventurer named Lucius. When Amethio was removed from pursuing Liko, his new assignment was to track down the Black Rayquaza, which escaped from Roy&#39;s ball.




That said, the organization is not a monolith operating in perfect order. Amethio used Black Rayquaza as an excuse to catch up to the Rising Volt Tacklers, who were also pursuing Rayquaza&#39;s trail, and explicitly went against orders in order to engage with Friede again. Amethio and Spinel also don&#39;t seem to get along very well, akin to the relationship between Jesse and Cassidy. The other admins have yet to feature heavily in the series, but certainly look to be opinionated people who might be difficult to get along with.



 What Lies Ahead for the Explorers? 
          

The Explorers are dead set on obtaining Liko&#39;s pendant, but with Amethio and Spinel having failed, the job will likely be passed to a new admin soon. They&#39;ve also put together that the pendant won&#39;t respond to just anyone, and Liko is the only person who has been able to activate it, so kidnapping Liko along with the pendant has become another goal. To that end, the Rising Volt Tacklers have sworn to protect Liko and the pendant, making the Explorers their enemies.




Many fans have speculated that Amethio, who was introduced before the show&#39;s first airing, may have some sort of redemption arc in the future, and that his failure and subsequent chastising may be the catalyst for this. So far, Amethio has remained loyal to the Explorers, but repeated failures and constantly going against orders may well see him leave the organization, either by force or by choice. Zirc and Onia have proven themselves loyal to Amethio more so than the Explorers, following him when he goes against orders, so in such an event, it&#39;s possible that they might leave as well.

The Explorers remain a very mysterious organization, with many secrets left to be revealed. As the primary antagonists of Pokémon Horizons, they&#39;re sure to continue appearing, at least until this pendant arc draws to a close. It&#39;s been very clear that without the support of experienced adults like Friede and the other Rising Volt Tacklers, Liko and Roy would be in very big trouble, which has made the Explorers into a very dangerous organization, unlike Team Rocket. Hopefully, future episodes of Pokémon Horizons will reveal more about the Explorers and what drives them to pursue the pendant.
