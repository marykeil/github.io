## Literature Review

One Piece contains several Devil Fruits powers that can devastate foes with a single touch, but Jewelry Bonney&#39;s just got a lot more brutal.





Jewelry Bonney&#39;s Devil Fruit has previously shown its victims&#39; ages altered significantly since she was first introduced during the Sabaody Archipelago arc. Marines have been seen turned into toddlers and even frail elderly people, completely removing an entire group of enemies&#39; fighting ability. However, chapter #1094 of One Piece showcases Bonney using her ability like never before. While firing a gun imbued with her powers, she decomposes a soldier into a skeleton before reverting him back to his original age, incapacitating the man by destroying him mentally with an attack called &#34;Near Death Experience&#34;, or NDE.





 Bonney&#39;s &#34;Near Death Experience&#34; Technique Makes Her Devil Fruit Even More Dangerous 
          

Bonney&#39;s aging abilities seemed incredibly useful before, but if she can age people to the point of decomposition in an instant with projectiles, her Devil Fruit could be considered one of the series&#39; most deadly abilities. Each foe hit by one of her projectiles falls to the ground, traumatized by the NDE. It&#39;s currently unclear if Bonney can choose to leave her enemies in a decomposed form or if she is simply giving her target the &#34;experience&#34; of aging to the point of death, thus taking them out with the mere physical and mental toll. This second option seems more likely, otherwise Bonney&#39;s Devil Fruit would simply be too overpowered.

During several intense moments in One Piece&#39;s story, Bonney has demonstrated how versatile and useful her Devil Fruit powers can be. She can control her age to the point of becoming an old woman or a tiny girl to infiltrate the world&#39;s most secure locations. Riches also come easy to her since her abilities can convert the value of her victim&#39;s lost years into jewelry. It was previously thought that the people or objects that Bonney wants to affect with her powers require her hands, but chapter #1094 significantly increases her abilities&#39; range and mental impact.

The Egghead Island arc has given readers many more opportunities to see Bonney&#39;s unnamed Devil Fruit powers in action. A big fan theory about One Piece&#39;s Bonney suggests she is actually a child pretending to be older than she is, thanks to her powers. Still, her abilities have gotten her this far in the story and may be a big help in fighting St. Jaygarcia Saturn. While strong Haki users have been shown to be able to withstand Devil Fruits&#39; abilities, it would be incredibly satisfying to see Bonney take out the man responsible for her father&#39;s misery. Bonney&#39;s Devil Fruit powers will likely be tested further with her thirst for revenge in the upcoming chapters of One Piece.
