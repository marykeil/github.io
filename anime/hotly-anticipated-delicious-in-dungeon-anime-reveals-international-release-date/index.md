## Literature Review

A new trailer for the upcoming Delicious in Dungeon confirms that it will also be appearing on Netflix in January, near the start of the year.




The upcoming anime adaptation of Delicious in Dungeon revealed its international release date on Netflix. The news broke with the latest trailer uploaded online, which gave further production details. International audiences can expect to dive right into the anime almost as soon as 2024 begins, on January 4, at the same time as Japanese audiences.




Delicious in Dungeon is hotly anticipated for several reasons. Besides providing a comedic twist to the fantasy genre, Studio Trigger is handling production, providing high-quality animation while remaining faithful to the manga&#39;s art style, as can be seen in the latest trailer uploaded to Kadokawa&#39;s YouTube Channel.


 

As a bonus for international anime fans, they won&#39;t be left behind waiting for the series to begin streaming in the West, as Delicious in Dungeon will broadcast everywhere on the same day.

The new trailer confirms that the anime will be broadcast simultaneously in Japan and overseas via Netflix on January 4, allowing all audiences to catch the new anime at the same time. While the Netflix deal was revealed prior at Anime Expo, the final premiere date was not. The new footage, besides showing Trigger&#39;s chops at capturing the manga&#39;s artstyle, also revealed the credits song chosen for the show: &#34;Party!!&#34;, performed by Ryoku Oushoku Shakai. Viewers will likely remember her voice if they watch The Apothecary Diaries this season, where she sang for the anime&#39;s opening song, &#34;Become a Flower&#34;.

New cast information also sheds more light on the anime&#39;s secondary cast. Kabru&#39;s adventuring party, in particular, had their voice actors revealed. Wataru Kato voices Kabru, the party&#39;s leader, while Rie Takahashi voices Rinsha, a mage and close confidante of the former. Yuya Hirose and Miyu Tomita voice the other party members. The group provides an amusing counterpart to Laios&#39;s group, showing what &#34;average&#34; dungeon divers are like without the protagonist&#39;s obsession with tasting the monsters. If the anime follows the story long enough, there may even be a chance of seeing their adventures when out of sight of the main protagonists.




          

While simultaneous broadcasts, or simulcasts, are becoming more popular, it&#39;s never a guarantee. Anime movies, at least, often wait several months before appearing online. Even though Netflix announced a January premiere months ago, it is assuring to know that there will be no lag between it and Japan&#39;s broadcast. It does beg whether Netflix will release all episodes at once, or follow a weekly release schedule. January 4, 2024 is only a few weeks away, so Delicious in Dungeon fans need only be patient for a little while longer to find out, and enjoy a great start to the next year.
