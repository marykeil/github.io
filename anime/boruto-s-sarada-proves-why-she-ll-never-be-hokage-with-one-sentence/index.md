## Literature Review

Sarada has got much of what it takes to be a Hokage, but her lack of confidence in herself proves she has a long way to go for her dream to come true.





The sentence, which came towards the beginning of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #2, was simple but spoke volumes about Sarada&#39;s leadership potential. Specifically, as Sarada and Boruto faced off against Code and a squad of his Claw Grime army, Boruto orders Sarada to fall back and worry about the citizens rather than continue a confrontation with Code. Boruto&#39;s statement implies that he believes Sarada is better suited to protecting bystanders and guiding them to safety rather than trading blows with Code. Surprisingly, Sarada not only complies, but as she falls back her only response is a weak: &#34;Boruto, are you sure?&#34;

 Sarada&#39;s Response To Boruto Proves She Is Not Ready To Be Hokage 
          

This is not the first time Boruto has felt Sarada lacks the gravitas of a frontline warrior. Moreover, it&#39;s obvious also he feels he&#39;s more able to handle a major villain on his own without any assistance. Considering how much effort Sarada has put in her dream of becoming a future Hokage, the timidity of her response to Boruto&#39;s command is shocking. Historically, it&#39;s the Hokage who has manned the frontline and taken the enemy head on. Indeed, the Hokage are the alpha shinobi even in a group of otherwise superlative ninjas. By comparison, Sarada&#39;s idol Naruto - who also had a lifelong dream to become Hokage - never met a challenge he would not stand up to. Whether it&#39;s taking on Pain by himself, or going after Sasuke when most people believed he was a lost cause, Naruto faced his challenges directly and at the spear&#39;s tip of a conflict. Even if told to fall back, Naruto would rush forward.




Of course, Boruto could simply be trusting Sarada to rescue the villagers, which is also what an Hokage should prioritize. However, the way the scene is presented doesn&#39;t do a lot of good to Sarada&#39;s character. Even more damning of her leadership capabilities is how quickly she puts her trust in Boruto over her trust in herself. Boruto has not been heard of in three years. It&#39;s possible that Sarada has been getting updates on his progress from her father, but based on Sasuke&#39;s past behaviors, this is unlikely. Nevertheless, despite the obvious fact that she&#39;s been working on improving herself, both physically and mentally, as soon as Boruto arrives, Sarada regresses to her old self and immediately reclaims her old habit of playing second to Boruto&#39;s lead.



 Being Hokage Means Wanting To Take Charge 
          




To become Hokage, one needs to have not just technical mastery of the ninja arts and hardcore battle experience, but also great social skills and, more importantly, the ability to lead and inspire others, which can only come from supreme confidence in oneself. While Sarada checks the boxes for most of the requirements, this chapter proves that she has serious confidence issues in her own abilities. Indeed, after all the criticism moved to Naruto and Boruto for their portrayals of female characters, readers would expect Sarada to be the one telling Boruto to fall back. Instead, Sarada immediately gave up all command authority to Boruto, which is the opposite of what an Hokage would have done, meaning that the Uchiha heir still has a long way to go.

Boruto - Blue Vortex is now available from Viz Media.
