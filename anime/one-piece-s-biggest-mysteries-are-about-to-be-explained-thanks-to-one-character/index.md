## Literature Review

The reason behind Kuma&#39;s inexplicable rampage on the Holy Land as well as several of Egghead&#39;s mysteries has been hiding in plain sight for months.





While the flashy fight between Admiral Kizaru and Luffy takes center stage for the most part in chapter #1092 of One Piece, the chapter also surreptitiously a key bit of information towards the end that could have countless implications. The tidbit in question is a panel of the Iron Giant awakening upon hearing the Drums of Liberation. Other than suggesting a connection to Nika and the Great Kingdom, the Iron Giant&#39;s awakening also suggests that Luffy may have awoken it earlier when he fought against Lucci, which led to Kuma&#39;s rampage on Marijoa. The former Warlord&#39;s actions coincidentally mimics the Iron Giant&#39;s behavior 200 years ago, alluding to the two being inextricably linked.

 Kuma May Possess The Will Of The Iron Giant 
          

Although several fans have noticed the parallels between Kuma and the Iron Giant, Chapter #1092 suggests these may be far more than simple parallels. In fact, Kuma may not be himself at all anymore but rather the Iron Giant. Kuma&#39;s unique Devil Fruit could have easily transferred the intangible will of the ancient robot into himself. Proof of this theory stems from chapter #1066 where Luffy claimed the Iron Giant must move on its own since he did not find a way to get in and control it. Coincidentally, the Iron Giant let out a loud sound when Luffy asked it to move with Kuma dashing towards the Red Line from Kamabakka Kingdom soon after in the very next chapter.

Not only would this theory explain the Kuma&#39;s rampage but also the existence of the cluster of Kuma&#39;s memories Bonney came across in chapter #1072 as well as her odd lack of hostility towards Vegapunk soon after. More importantly, Vegapunk has explicitly mentioned his interest in studying the weight of emotions and Kuma may have very well played a large role in that research. Of course, there is also the possibility that Kuma is simply passing through the Red Line and Marijoa on the way to his destination, which seems to be Egghead. The fact that he is headed for the Iron Giant location, however, would confirm the connection between the two.






 The Iron Giant Could Prove Nika Is Connected to the Eternal Flame 
          

Luffy&#39;s ability to awaken the Iron Giant while using Gear Five all but confirms Sun God Nika&#39;s connection to the Great Kingdom besides also shedding light on the mysterious Eternal Flame mentioned by Lilith in Chapter #1065, which she claimed she could create a &#39;sun&#39; of her own. Moreover, in Chapter #1067, Shaka reveals that the Great Kingdom possessed an unimaginable power source that powered the Iron Giant that even his genius could not recreate. Seeing as the sound of Nika&#39;s heartbeat has caused the Iron Giant to power back up, the Great Kingdom&#39;s power source and the Eternal Flame could very well be one and the same.

All things considered, what spurred the Iron Giant into action 200 years ago remains a mystery. That said, on a brighter note, there may still be a way to save Kuma and help him regain his sense of self after all. While he has not appeared a lot in the story, Kuma&#39;s past is possibly the key that will unlock many of the main mysteries of the story, including Nika and the Great Kingdom. Despite being in its &#34;final arc&#34;, One Piece continues to give its readers mysteries to unravel, but it&#39;s possible that the one connecting Kuma and the Iron Giant will be explained very soon.
