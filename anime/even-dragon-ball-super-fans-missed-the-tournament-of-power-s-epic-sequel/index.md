## Literature Review

The Super Space-Time Tournament features several characters from the main Dragon Ball multiverse including Goku, Jiren, Hit, and even Yamcha.




The Tournament of Power arc was one of the most anticipated sagas in Dragon Ball history. With the promise of dozens of the multiverse&#39;s most powerful warriors fighting in an all-out battle royale, fans were on the edge of their seats as Goku and company fought their way to the finish. Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission decided to emulate that hype and success with the introduction of an even grander tournament: the Super Space-Time Tournament.




Though its name is a bit of a mouthful, the Super Space-Time Tournament has a surprisingly simple premise. There are twelve teams, each with seven team members. The teams are selected from alternate timelines instead of differing universes, which has led several characters from different universes to be on the same team.

          

Most of the Z Warriors are on Team 1, which consists of Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Yamcha, Jiren, and Hit. These familiar faces are just the tip of the iceberg, however, as the Super Space-Time Tournament digs deep into Dragon Ball lore to find its combatants.

Other teams that are part of the Super Space-Time Tournament bring back some forgotten and film-exclusive characters. Even characters who made up the lower ranks of the Red Ribbon Army, such as Ninja Murasaki and General White, are present at this tournament, which must mean that in some strange alternate history, the Red Ribbon Army consisted of the strongest warriors in the universe. Other warriors attending the tournament include the Ginyu Force, the Lord Slug Force, Babidi’s henchmen, and Garlic Jr.&#39;s Spice Boys.

The Super Space-Time Tournament is undoubtedly one of the wildest events in Dragon Ball history. The winner of the tournament was promised &#34;godly prizes,&#34; while losers, like in the Tournament of Power, have their timelines erased. Aside from near-forgotten characters, the combatants also contained a number of alternate timeline versions of the Z Warriors, such as Team 2&#39;s &#34;Xeno&#34; versions. Both Frieza and Mecha Frieza are present on different teams as well, and even GT characters like Super 17 appear. The narrator of the series also expands on Dragon Ball lore by giving an exact number for the main timeline’s place in history, that being History: 76,434,925,761.




The Super Space-Time Tournament dialed everything from the Tournament of Power up a notch and allowed some unexpected pairings between characters with little in common. Most notable are the two-man teams of Jiren and Yamcha, the classic Gohan and Piccolo, and even Universe 6&#39;s Hit and Pan. The tournament wasted no time pitting characters against each other in long-awaited battles, like the hotly anticipated Jiren versus Broly, offering fans the answer to one of the most talked-about match-ups in Dragon Ball history. While the Super Space-Time Tournament is of dubious canonicity, it hardly matters with this degree of time travel at work, and it&#39;s a real treat for Dragon Ball fans of all stripes.

               Dragon Ball Super   Summary:   Dragon Ball Super is a sequel to the original Dragon Ball series as well as the fan-favorite Dragon Ball Z anime.
