## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen has some of the best fights in anime and manga and they have one big secret: teamwork.




As one of the best action manga and anime of all time, Jujutsu Kaisen has incredible fights that have been enchanting viewers since the start of the series. As action-packed as it is, the series has also many interesting characters and a mysterious and at times confusing power system. However, there is one secret ingredient that makes most of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s fights so unique: teamwork.




Most action anime utilize one-on-one fights, and it usually works. There&#39;s no greater feeling for a viewer than to see two characters have an intense, life-or-death fight that is uninterrupted. The best example is the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke. Jujutsu Kaisen also has many one-on-one fights, but the frequency of tag teams and two-on-one fights greatly differentiates this series from other shonen.

          

Since the beginning of Jujutsu Kaisen, the amount of two vs one and sometimes three-on-one fights shown really makes the series stand out in its genre. Some might even consider the fights unfair, but it&#39;s important to remember that the battles in Jujutsu Kaisen are often a matter of life or death.


 Itadori Is Involved In Almost All Of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Team fights 
          




Yuji Itadori has participated in almost all the two-on-one fights in the series. He enhances his teammate&#39;s performance and matches their speed and abilities. This is mostly due to the trust he gives to whoever he fights alongside, which speaks a lot to his innocent nature. He even saved Nanami from certain death when he was trapped in Mahito&#39;s Domain Expansion, forcefully breaking the barrier and rescuing his comrade. However, this doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t fight alone, as he demonstrated several times already.

From the spectacular fight that sees Itadori and Todo take on Hanami to the battle between Panda and Inumaki versus Geto in the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie, the show does not shy away from an &#34;unfair fight&#34;. In a world where curses do not play by the rules and have no morals, the sorcerers have to adapt and throw away any notion of honor to exorcise these evil villains. Curses do not care about the rules or honor, as demonstrated when they concocted a brutal but effective way to limit Gojo&#39;s power by using civilian bystanders.






 The Shibuya Incident Arc Features The Best Teamwork Fights 
          

As the most appreciated arc of Jujutsu Kaisen, it should not come as a surprise that the Shibuya Incident takes this unique aspect of the show and takes it to the next level. This time, however, the curses are also working together to take down an opponent. The fight where Gojo alone takes on Hanami, Jogo, and Choso is by right one of the best in the series. While Jujutsu Kaisen later features more one-on-one battles during the Culling Game arc, teamwork and tag team fights remain one of the best and most unique aspects of the series, one that helps it stand out from other similar products.
