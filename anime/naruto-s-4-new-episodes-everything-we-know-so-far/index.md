## Literature Review

In a pleasant surprise to Naruto And Naruto Shippuden fans across the world, new episodes of the classic ninja anime are currently in the works.




It&#39;s been a while since the last time fans of the hit anime series Naruto could tune in and watch a new episode of Masashi Kishimoto&#39;s legendary ninja classic, but that&#39;s now no longer the case. In celebration of the Naruto anime&#39;s anniversary, a four-episode special was announced to be in production, giving fans the first new episodes (aside from the Boruto series) since the series concluded in 2017. Unfortunately, the episodes were not released when originally planned.




In a March post to the official Naruto website, four new episodes of the Naruto anime were revealed to be in the works. The first was set to air in September 2023 for all fans to see, but the month came and went without the new episodes. Unfortunately, the announcement did not include any details as to what the new episodes would be about or at what point the episodes would take place in the franchise&#39;s timeline.

          

To pump up interest, reruns of the original series began broadcasting in Japan during July. However, a Naruto Production Committee decided to postpone the episodes a few days before the first episode was expected to air. The sudden decision was made in order to &#34;create a work that meets everyone&#39;s expectations.&#34; The post on X from the official Naruto account was made with an apology to fans but no update on when viewers should expect the episodes or what they would be about.

 The Story of Naruto&#39;s 4-Episode Anime Special 
         

The plot details surrounding the new Naruto episodes have so far been a mystery. There has yet to be an announcement or a preview to provide hints into the episodes&#39; story. Artwork released surrounding the anniversary has stylishly depicted effective summaries of each of the series&#39; significant time periods, giving fans hope that the new episodes might explore an unseen adventure before Naruto became the Hokage. There are many potentially incredible moments from the franchise that the manga and anime have not covered that fans would love to see, like Naruto&#39;s life after the Fourth Great Shinobi War and before he became the Seventh Hokage.




Another great story the new Naruto anime episodes could cover is the recently released short manga revolving around Naruto&#39;s mom and dad titled Naruto: The Whorl Within The Spiral. After winning the Naruto worldwide popularity poll, The Fourth Hokage and Father of Naruto, Minato Namikaze, received his own short story written and even illustrated by series author Masashi Kishimoto. The manga was so great that it proved the Naruto series still has great stories to tell, and it would be a fantastic project for the Naruto anime to adapt.



 Naruto&#39;s Anime Return Is Still In The Works 
          

The original anime adaptation of Naruto premiered in October 2002 and ran for 220 episodes. The follow-up series, Naruto: Shippuden, aired shortly after the original series ended in February 2007 and ran until March 2017. While the series generally followed the plot of Kishimoto&#39;s original manga, there were a number of anime-only Naruto story arcs. During their run, Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden grew to become international hits and beloved pillars of anime fandom. The story of a young Naruto bootstrapping his way to success is a story that appeals to a wide range of people and cultures. The diversity and complexity of the Narutoverse also make it easy for fans to see themselves in many of its characters.




The same release detailing Naruto&#39;s new episodes also announced that the first part of the Boruto anime will end on the March 26, 2023 episode and that production has begun on the second part of the anime. With Boruto getting its own Shippuden style part 2 and Naruto&#39;s anime set to return, it&#39;s never been a better time to be a fan of Masashi Kishimoto&#39;s ninja world.
