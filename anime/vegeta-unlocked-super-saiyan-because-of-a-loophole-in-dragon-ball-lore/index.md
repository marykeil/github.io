# Vegeta Unlocked Super Saiyan Because of a Loophole in Dragon Ball Lore


## SUMMARY 



  Vegeta&#39;s ability to go Super Saiyan was originally hindered by his impure and evil heart, but he found a loophole in Dragon Ball lore to achieve the transformation.   Despite being a villain in the past, Vegeta&#39;s training and newfound strength allow him to go Super Saiyan and showcase his power to the shocked Z Fighters.   Vegeta&#39;s realization that being true to oneself and having a calm heart filled with a defining trait, even if it is pure evil, can still lead to unlocking the Super Saiyan transformation.

## Literature Review

While every Dragon Ball fan knows Vegeta can go Super Saiyan, he wasn&#39;t always able to, but he finally unlocked the form because of one loophole. 




While it is well established at this point in Dragon Ball continuity (and for the last few decades) that Vegeta can go Super Saiyan, that wasn’t always the case, and his inability to do so had nothing to do with his power level. However, because of a loophole in established Dragon Ball lore, Vegeta was able to achieve that transformation and wield a level of power he was never supposed to obtain.




Vegeta was introduced in Dragon Ball chapter 204 by Akira Toriyama, and while he may be a heroic Z Fighter now, he was originally a vile villain who nearly wiped out all life on Planet Earth. Vegeta was the leader of the last surviving Saiyans. Their mission was to travel from planet to planet, eliminate the indigenous life there, and then sell the vacant world to the highest bidder. Not only did Vegeta do this without failure, but he truly enjoyed killing those he viewed as weaker than he was.

          

Readers see Vegeta&#39;s villainy in action to its fullest extent when the Saiyan went up against powerless innocents on Planet Namek in search of the Dragon Balls. Just to obtain a single Dragon Ball, Vegeta wiped out an entire village of Namekians without a shred of remorse. This heinous atrocity proved that Vegeta’s heart was filled with pure evil–something that originally held him back from reaching his full potential.





 Vegeta Can Only Go Super Saiyan Because He is Pure Evil 
          

In Dragon Ball chapter 319 by Akira Toriyama, Goku unlocks the Super Saiyan form for the first time after he witnesses the death of Krillin by the hands of Frieza. Goku explains that he was able to accomplish this achievement because he was a Saiyan with a pure heart that was awakened by rage. When Frieza hears this, he laughs to himself as he finally understands why Vegeta was never able to achieve Super Saiyan even after all those years working under him. Vegeta’s heart wasn’t pure, so he could never become a Super Saiyan. That is, until the Saiyan Prince found a loophole that suited him just fine.

In Dragon Ball chapter 343 by Akira Toriyama, Vegeta arrives at the scene of a battle between the Z Fighters and the Androids after training for three years in preparation for the villains’ arrival following the warning he got from Future Trunks. When he gets there, Vegeta wastes no time showing off his newfound strength – including his ability to go Super Saiyan. When the other Z Fighters are shocked by Vegeta’s transformation as they knew the only reason Goku was able to unlock it was just as much due to his pure heart as it was his unparalleled strength, Vegeta replies by saying, “But my heart is calm and pure. Pure evil!”.




The original Dragon Ball lore states that a Saiyan must have a pure heart to become a Super Saiyan, but Vegeta realized that it didn’t matter what type of ‘pure’ his heart was. Essentially, Vegeta figured out that the trick to becoming a Super Saiyan was to just be oneself, no matter how disgustingly vile that self is. So long as a Saiyan knows who they are, and has a calm heart filled with whatever their defining trait happens to be, mixed with the raw power to actually pull the transformation off, then they can go Super Saiyan–proving that Vegeta unlocked the iconic Dragon Ball transformation because of a single loophole in the established lore.
