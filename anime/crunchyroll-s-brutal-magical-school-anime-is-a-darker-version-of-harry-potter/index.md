# Crunchyroll s Brutal Magical School Anime Is A Darker Version Of Harry Potter


## SUMMARY 



  Reign of the Seven Spellblades puts a brutal spin on the magic school trope, with dangers lurking within its version of Hogwarts called Kimberly Magic Academy.   Unlike Hogwarts, Kimberly is essentially entirely off-limits due to its lurking dangers, and its teachers take a hands-off approach, leaving students to face numerous perils on their own.   While there are similarities to Harry Potter, Reign of the Seven Spellblades deviates with darker tones, involving torture and a unique samurai culture, appealing to a more mature viewership.

## Literature Review

Crunchyroll&#39;s Reign of the Seven Spellblades gives Harry Potter a much deadlier and darker theme.




Reign of the Seven Spellblades, streaming on Crunchyroll, is an anime that features young mages learning magic in a castle just like Harry Potter, but the similarities end there. J.K. Rowling&#39;s Wizarding World is nowhere near as dark as this one, and this anime puts a much more brutal spin on the magic school trope.




Much of the story in Reign of the Seven Spellblades is driven by the many dangers within the walls of its version of Hogwarts called Kimberly Magic Academy.

          

In fact, Kimberly&#39;s headmistress has to give her own &#34;most painful death&#34; speech much as Professor Dumbledore did during Harry&#39;s first year. However, unlike Hogwarts&#39; case, which was only in regard to specific sections of Hogwarts, the entirety of Kimberly is essentially out of bounds if students don&#39;t want to die. Moreover, its teachers take a much more hands-off approach, forcing Kimberly&#39;s students to contend with a greater number of perils on their own.



Reign of the Seven Spellblades is an adaptation of the original light novel series by writer Bokuto Uno and illustrator Ruria Miyuki.








 Reign Of The Seven Spellblades Turns Hogwarts Into A Killing Ground 
         

These perils are all directly associated with Kimberly itself, while Hogwarts serves as a safe haven for students. The real horrors inside Hogwarts were the direct result of Voldemort&#39;s influence, mere memory, or actual presence within its nearly impenetrable walls. Kimberly&#39;s many dangers surely nod to things that Harry Potter fans may be familiar with, but the series turns everything up more than a few notches. Kimberly has its own version of Harry Potter&#39;s changing staircases, but it&#39;s a labyrinth deep within the bowels of the school that takes over the school grounds at night, causing many students to get lost. It&#39;s within this maze where students are killed by monsters and even their own upperclassmen.

The similarities abound, and they go to a deeper level. In Harry Potter, Hermione is a staunch defender of elven rights, and in one of the stories in Reign of the Seven Spellblades a girl named Katie shows respect for so-called demi-humans, despite the fact that mages normally treat them like lesser beings. However, the anime goes so far as to involve torture, including magical brain surgery and manipulation. This isn&#39;t the first time that an anime has obviously been inspired by Harry Potter. A most recent and popular example is Mashle: Magic and Muscles, which however takes a comedy route and mixes Potter-esque imagery with common shonen tropes.




          

 Although Reign of the Seven Spellblades is similar to Rowling&#39;s work, it also deviates in many ways, including a type of magical power that transforms the user&#39;s hair and a unique samurai culture where true happiness can only be attained through the killing of a loved one. More importantly, it takes the famous franchise&#39;s magical school setting and it paints it in darker tones, making the best use of anime&#39;s more mature viewership target. Regardless, it&#39;s obvious that a franchise as massively popular as Harry Potter will continue to inspire series like Reign of the Seven Spellblades, for better or worse.
