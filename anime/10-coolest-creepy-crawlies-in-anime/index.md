## Literature Review

The coolest creepy crawlies in anime make good use of the common phobia of bugs, with brilliant visual designs based on real-life insects.




When it comes to compelling characters, few art forms opt to depict creepy crawlies. If characters based on moths, spiders, or mosquitoes appear, it&#39;s usually as gross, one-note monsters who are there to send a shiver up the spine. However, that&#39;s not the case in anime. Anime artists have fully embraced the visual potential of bugs, exploring their creepy aspects for tragic villains and conflicted heroes, and accentuating cute details to make them surprisingly adorable.
Here, then, are the 10 greatest creepy crawly characters in anime, from the heroic to the terrifying to the cute and friendly. The best anime bugs have unique designs while also mining thematic depth from their insectoid or arachnid nature - as these entries prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.









 








 10  Rosine - Berserk 
The Star of One of Berserk&#39;s Most Memorable Fight Scenes


 







Combining a childlike innocence with a monstrous moth-like form, Rosine became one of the most infamous Berserk Apostles by opposing Guts in a genuinely disturbing story arc. The original manga&#39;s nightmarish Lost Children story arc culminates in Guts&#39; lengthy and closely fought battle with Rosine, one of Berserk&#39;s most memorable fight scenes. Despite Rosine&#39;s childlike personality, she proves a tenacious opponent to Guts. While a fairly minor enemy in the overall plot of Berserk, Rosine remains well-known by fans thanks to being such an unsettling character, with the thematic and narrative aspects of her character and backstory being complemented by how well-executed the visual design of her monstrous moth form is.





 9  Kumonga - Godzilla Singular Point 
A Genius Reimagining of the Classic Kaiju
        

Kumonga is one of the most interesting reimaginings of the classic kaiju seen in Singular Point. Combining the design of the spider Kumonga, the drill-handed beetle Megalon, the mantis Kamacuras, and cult classic kaiju Gigan - with each one&#39;s exoskeleton apparently housing a version of the smog monster Hedorah - the Singular Point version of Kumonga is a love letter to some of the lesser-known kaiju of the Godzilla franchise. Like all of the kaiju in Singular Point, Kumonga is depicted as significantly smaller in size than in previous depictions. The heroes&#39; excursion to a webbed-up boathouse overrun by a swarm of Kumonga feels more like something out of a horror movie than a typical kaiju movie, and yet that only makes the creature feel more insectoid and terrifying.





 8  The Spider Family - Demon Slayer 
Incredibly Creepy, But Also Surprisingly Sympathetic


 







The villains of Demon Slayer&#39;s Mount Natagumo Arc, the Spider Family are incredibly uncanny and creepy - none moreso than the spider-headed father. With spider-like markings and razor-wire webbing, the Spider Family are deadly, perfectly evoking their arachnid namesacks while retaining enough human qualities to feel both tragic and sympathetic. After being turned into a demon, the orphan Rui creates a family of demons to replace his human family. Rui&#39;s refusal to be separated from his new family ultimately drives much of the tragedy for the Spider Family, as his controlling personality only causes him to be isolated from the others as the Demon Slayers begin their fateful mission to Mount Natagumo.
            
 
 10 Best Anime Fans of Demon Slayer Need to Watch 
Fans of the hit anime Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba are also likely to enjoy some of these other anime series, many of which feature Japanese demons.








 7  Myoga - Inuyasha 
A Surprisingly Inventive Take on the Mentor Figure
        

Ostensibly a mentor and advisor to Inuyasha, Myoga primarily exists for the sake of slapstick comedy. Despite the overarching plot being an epic historical fantasy adventure, Inuyasha includes numerous funny episodes, and Myoga himself provides a lot of comedic moments. The old flea constantly finds novel new ways to get squashed, not helped by his habit of trying to drink Inuyasha&#39;s blood. However, he does also get moments of relevance to the plot. Myoga often guides Inuyasha and his companions towards their next goal or advises them on people to seek out for help in their pursuit of the shards of the Shikon Jewel. Most significantly, he has saved the lives of the main cast by sucking poison out of their blood.





 6  Shino&#39;s Parasitic Insects - Naruto 
Despite a Wildly Creepy Jutsu, Shino Is a Hero
        

Although the jutsu depicted in Naruto are usually conceptually and visually impressive, Shino Aburame&#39;s stands out for several reasons, the creepiness factor being the most notable. Not only is Shino able to control a swarm of insects that can devour his enemies&#39; chakra, but his entire body serves as the insects&#39; hive. Although Shino even creeps out his allies, he is solidly on the side of good and is consistently depicted as effective and powerful. The Parasitic Insects are an effective method of gathering information, and he puts them to devastating effect. Coupling his powerful jutsu with a brilliant tactical mind, Shino has proven himself one of the most capable ninja in the entire franchise.





 5  Zabuton - Farming Life in Another World 
How Is a Non-Speaking Character This Beloved?
        

A giant spider who arrives unannounced at Hiraku&#39;s farm, Zabuton makes her entrance like she&#39;s setting up a major fight scene. Instead, she immediately proves herself friendly and helpful to Hiraku and his companions. Residing in the farm&#39;s giant tree and primarily eating potatoes, Zabuton establishes herself as the farm&#39;s tailor, creating cloth and turning raw materials provided by the other inhabitants of the farm into clothing. Additionally, Zabuton only communicating non-verbally creates some excellent visual comedy and communicates a wealth of personality.





 4  Kumoko - So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? 
While Technically a Villain, Everyone Loves Kumoko
Officially unnamed in the series, but commonly known as Kumoko - basically Japanese for &#34;Spider Girl&#34; - the heroine of So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? is not the first Isekai character to be reincarnated as a low-level creature, but the series nevertheless takes a novel approach to the concept. Reincarnated as a low-level monster in a high-level dungeon, Kumoko is quickly forced to rely on her natural wits, pluck, and familiarity with fantasy RPG mechanics to survive in a world where everything is trying to kill her. Despite technically being a villain, Kumoko is such an underdog and has such an enjoyable personality that she&#39;s always a sympathetic character.





 3  The Ohmu - Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind 
Ohmu Represents the Natural World&#39;s Power
        

Hayao Miyazaki has long embraced ecological messages in his work, and this idea is embodied in the Ohmu. Based on an original manga written by Miyazaki, Nausicaä champions both pacifism and environmentalism. The natural world of the film is embodied by the Ohmu: giant, armored, bug-like creatures that Nausicaä spends the film trying to keep in harmony with humanity despite their destructive potential. Notably, Nausicaä attempts to keep harmony both between humans and the Ohmu and between the different warring factions of humanity, with these conflicts depicted as being inextricably linked. It&#39;s only after peace is established with the Ohmu that it becomes possible between humans.
Miyazaki&#39;s famous &#39;no cuts&#39; policy towards English translations of his films stems from the original English release of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind mangling the intended message.







 2  Tentomon - Digimon 
Izzy &amp; Tentomon Had One of Digimon&#39;s Best Bonds


 







The partner Digimon of one of the eight DigiDestined, Tentomon is a fitting counterpart to his human partner Izzy. Both are sarcastic and intelligent to the point of being know-it-alls, but are kindhearted and loyal at their cores. Indeed, their compatibility helps sell the initial idea of the Digimon/DigiDestined bond. Together with Izzy, Tentomon explains a lot of what&#39;s happening in the Digital World for the benefit of both the other characters and the audience. Tentomon is also notable for being one of the few Digimon whose Digivolutions remain conceptually consistent. Rather than being a cat or a guinea pig-bat who turns into an angel, or a werewolf who turns into a robot, Tentomon is a beetle who turns into a series of progressively larger, more powerful beetle Digimon.





 1  Butterfree - Pokémon 
Ash&#39;s Second Pokémon Created Some Tear-Jerking Moments


 







The first Pokémon Ash Ketchum ever caught as part of his journey (after being gifted Pikachu), Butterfree is the central Pokémon in one of the anime&#39;s most famous episodes. &#39;Bye Bye Butterfree&#39; established the template of Ash releasing his Pokémon so they could thrive in a different environment, and is still remembered by fans as one of Pokémon&#39;s best episodes and one of the most genuinely tear-jerking storylines in the franchise.
While nowhere near Ash&#39;s most powerful Pokémon, Butterfree was one of the anime&#39;s most stalwart characters, and provided some great moments that helped introduce the entire Pokémon world. Ash learning to catch Pokémon, utilizing status effects, and being confronted with incredibly unhelpful evolutions - like the next-to-useless Metapod - all begin with Butterfree. Years later, Ash and Butterfree would be reunited in a heartwarming episode of Journeys, providing closure and a silver lining to one of the saddest moments in the early episodes of the series.
In most media, bugs are there to be disgusting and little else. However, in the hands of gifted anime creators they can be everything from tragic villains to cute traveling companions to the embodiment of the natural world - a fact that&#39;s perfectly exemplified by these 10 awesome anime creepy crawlies.
