## Literature Review

Mahito might be one of the most powerful curses in Jujutsu Kaisen, but an awesome piece of fan art shows an enraged Yuji made him fear for his life.




While Yuji Itadori is one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s friendliest and most easy-going characters, his potential for fierce determination is showcased in a stunning piece of fan artwork. The piece reminds fans just how hardcore Yuji can be with the right sort of motivation, and how, in rare instances of provocation, he will stop at nothing to defeat the evil that stands in his way.




In the artwork shared on X, artist @whostenri reimagines Yuji&#39;s fight with Mahito at the conclusion of the Shibuya Incident story arc. Although it is just one beautifully drawn art piece, it perfectly summarizes the feelings and emotions of both Yuji and Mahito as their fight nears its end.


 

This is most clearly illustrated by how Tenri portrays the faces of the characters. Yuji&#39;s glaring visage and pupil-less eye perfectly capture the rage he has towards Mahito – who, at that moment, he deems the most evil and vicious curse in existence. As depicted, the face mixes elements of Sukuna&#39;s appearance with Yuji&#39;s, making it unclear to the viewer who is actually in charge – Yuji or Sukuna. Conversely, the look on Mahito&#39;s face flawlessly sums up the utter fear of Yuji he is now feeling.





 Yuji&#39;s Determination To Kill Mahito Marked A Turning Point 
Produced by MAPPA, based on the original manga by Gege Akutami
          

This is a Yuji who is much more dangerous than when they first met. At that time, Mahito saw Yuji as inexperienced and weak. But now, Tenri&#39;s depiction shows Mahito desperately afraid for his life. Stumbling into Shibuya Subway station, Yuji sees Mahito in the process of killing Nanami and immediately charges at him. While Mahito quickly grasps how dangerous Yuji is, he still seems confident he can defeat him. Mahito maintains his confidence even after Nobara Kugisaki joins the fight in support of Yuji. In fact, the two are no match for Mahito, and after killing Nobara, Mahito is just seconds away from doing the same to a broken and battered Yuji.

This leads to the second round of their fight. Having entered the subway station just seconds before Mahito is about to kill Yuji, Aoi Todo uses his Boogie Woogie technique to transport Mahito away from Yuji to another part of the station. This gives Yuji enough time to regain his composure, and, motivated by his self-proclaimed &#34;brother&#34;, find the strength to fight back. Now teamed up with Todo, Yuji plows into battle again with Mahito. While they manage to overcome the powerful curse, Todo is nevertheless incapacitated and loses his cursed technique.






 The End Of Yuji vs. Mahito Is One Of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Best Scenes 

 

As Tenri&#39;s artwork illustrates, Yuji was determined to eliminate Mahito and would spare no effort in doing so. For a character who usually hated killing, this moment marked a huge turning point for Yuji, perfectly recreated in the anime. The moment when Yuji says &#34;I&#39;m just like you&#34; is followed by Mahito running away like a scared child, after causing so much death and terror. That scene will remain in Jujutsu Kaisen fans&#39; minds for a long time, and this piece of fan art is the perfect tribute to that incredible Yuji moment.
