In recent years, Spider-Man has been playing a huge role in Marvel&#39;s multiverse. Over in DC&#39;s multiverse, Batman has a &#34;Spider Society&#34; of his own.





Summary

  Batman has his own version of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Verse concept with the introduction of the Bat Dimension.   In the Bat Dimension, Batman&#39;s subconscious meets with other versions of himself to train and share ideas.   While Batman is not the first superhero to use this concept, it showcases the popularity and appeal of multiple versions of iconic characters.  







It&#39;s no secret that Batman is a beloved character, and he&#39;s just taken an idea from one of Marvel&#39;s most popular concepts: the Spider-Verse. Despite Peter Parker&#39;s unassuming origins, he&#39;s one of the major pillars of Marvel&#39;s Universe, having an entire secret society of Spider-Men in Across the Spider-Verse as well as Marvel&#39;s comics. Now Batman has his version of this idea with his Bat Dimension.

Readers are introduced to the Bat Dimension in Outsiders #3 by Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, and Robert Carey. The Bat Dimension seems to be a dimension where the various subconsciousness of Batmen across the Multiverse can gather to train and come up with ideas to fight crime better.

          

Considering that Batman can solve mysteries in his sleep, the fact that he is apparently training in his sleep as well isn&#39;t too absurd — even if it is in a different dimension. What is surprising is that another character from anotehr publisher has a very similar concept already at play. While Batman sleeps and his subconscious meets with other versions of himself, Spider-Man has an entire society of other versions that he can train with as well.




                  DC Changes Batman Lore Forever With the Introduction of &#34;Dimension Batman&#34;   DC has permanently altered Batman&#39;s mythos forever with the introduction of the mysterious, otherworldly Dimension Batman.    


 DC Comics Officially Reveals Dimension Batman 
          

Batman is one of the most well-trained vigilantes on the planet, and Dimension Batman is just one more reason why that is. While almost everyone knows that Batman has traveled around the world and trained to become the skilled individual he is now, that&#39;s apparently not where it ends. Even while sleeping, Batman continues to train and share ideas with other versions of himself. While asleep, his subconscious mind enters the Dimension Batman, where he then meets other Batmen. In one of the Batmen&#39;s own words, they come here to &#34;share ideas.&#34; Even while sleeping, Batman continues to think and train on how to defeat crime in the most efficient way possible — with help from himself.




While the idea of Batman teaming up with other versions of himself to train is certainly cool, he&#39;s not the first superhero to make use of such a concept. Spider-Man is immensely important to the Marvel Multiverse, and there are infinite versions of Spider-Man throughout the Multiverse. Being Spider-Man is difficult, which is why some of them have banded together to create the Spider-Society. This society exists to help gather and train new Spider-Men, helping them rely on the knowledge of Spider-Men who have already gone through similar tragedies. It&#39;s a fun idea that really makes use of the Multiverse across Marvel&#39;s comics and movies — and now Batman has his own version.



 Batman Comics Take Inspiration from the Spider-Verse 
          

There&#39;s no denying that as far as popular comic book characters go, Batman and Spider-Man are near the top of the list. These two characters have appeared in almost every medium imaginable. It&#39;s no surprise that their respective companies would eventually try to capitalize on that by simply having more versions of them. Marvel figured out how to do this first with Spider-Man&#39;s Spider-Society, and now DC has finally managed to figure out something similar for Batman. While Batman sleeps, his subconscious mind joins up with various Batmen across the multiverse, finally giving Batman his very own Dimension — just like the Spider-Verse.
