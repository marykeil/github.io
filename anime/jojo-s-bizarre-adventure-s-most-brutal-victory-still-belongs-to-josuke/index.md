# JoJo s Bizarre Adventure s Most Brutal Victory Still Belongs To Josuke


## SUMMARY 



  Josuke&#39;s victory over Karaiya in Crazy Diamond&#39;s Demonic Heartbreak is one of the most absurd and violent takedowns in the Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure series.   Karaiya is lifted into the air like a hot air balloon due to the heat from a welding torch, while being burned by the torch&#39;s flame the entire time.   This victory showcases the potential brutal consequences for anyone who tries to harm Josuke or his family, as seen in his previous victories over major criminals.

## Literature Review

Crazy Diamond&#39;s Demonic Heartbreak sees Josuke victorious, but the way he wins may be one of Jojo&#39;s craziest and most brutal victories of all time.




The Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure series has seen some completely brutal takedowns of opponents in its long run, including by Josuke himself. But when it comes to the most unforgettable, one of Josuke&#39;s victories is simultaneously one of the most absurd, and one of the most violent to date.




The spinoff series Crazy Diamond&#39;s Demonic Heartbreak sees Josuke confront the mastermind behind the Stand-wielding parrot Petsounds, Karaiya. After unloading a barrage of &#34;ORA&#34; on him, Karaiya managed to get tangled in the hose of a welding torch, sending him falling off a building into a tarp. But it doesn&#39;t stop there.

          

The tarp quickly opens like a parachute, slowing his descent. But the heat from the activated welding torch also causes the tarped villain to gain lift like a hot air balloon. Thus, Karaiya was kept aloft indefinitely, unable to free himself without falling, while being burned by the torch the entire time he was in the air--right to the face.


 Josuke vs Karaiya is The Most Absurd Victory Yet 
          




Josuke has had some pretty brutal victories before, but never &#34;burn a man&#39;s face off&#34; brutal. Since Crazy Diamond&#39;s Demonic Heartbreak is set before part 4, it means that this takedown of Karaiya, a corrupt police officer, was probably one of his first. Perhaps that shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise, because his first win in Diamond is Unbreakable involves turning a major criminal with a Stand, Angelo, into a stone for the rest of the series. Angelo killed Josuke&#39;s grandfather and tried to attack Josuke&#39;s mother, while Karaiya here nearly killed Josuke himself, so it seems like attacking Josuke or his family really runs the risk of some hefty punishment.

Within the greater Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure franchise, the most brutal victory likely belongs to Joseph, after launching Kars into space and leaving him to float in the endless void for all eternity. While he might not have gone quite that extreme, it&#39;s fitting that Karaiya would be defeated in a similar sort of way, since Karaiya similarly thought of himself as better than humanity (and hoped to become one of the vampires, which Kars created).




While this Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure spinoff may have defeated its main villain in humiliating fashion, Crazy Diamond&#39;s Demonic Heartbreak isn&#39;t a one-note adventure. After seeing what Josuke did to his first opponent, every villain would do well to keep away from Josuke and his family.
