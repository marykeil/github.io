## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident completely changed the series&#39; status quo, both by removing characters from the story and establishing later plots.




The Shibuya Incident changed the status quo of Jujutsu Kaisen forever. The arc is one of the best in Shonen history, so it only makes sense that it would have a major impact on the series as a whole. This also makes it refreshing given how many major franchises can be reticent to shake up their already established characters and world.
There are of course other modern Shonen exceptions to this trend. Chainsaw Man is famous for this, as by the end of its first season it killed many of the Devil hunters fans had met up to that point. Even less subversive series like My Hero Academia have had major status quo shifts, as that series turned its version of Japan into a bit of a dystopia after the Paranormal Liberation War arc. What makes that shift different is that it occurs right before the final arcs and it also doesn&#39;t really affect the composition of the cast. The Shibuya Incident was different, affecting almost every aspect of the series in major ways.









 








 10  New Sorcerers Will Be Added to the Cast 
Occurred in Episode #23
        

At the end of the Shibuya Incident, the sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body uses Mahito&#39;s cursed technique to turn a myriad of people across Japan into new sorcerers. While this may not seem that impactful at the moment, these new sorcerers will become incredibly important in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s next arc. In addition, this has the added benefit of waking Megumi&#39;s sister from her coma, and thrusting her into the main plot of the series. This will have a major impact on Megumi&#39;s motivation and actions going forward.





 9  No More High School Adventures 
Implied by Episode #23
        

The Shibuya Incident killed or maimed most of Jujutsu High&#39;s students and much of its staff. With Principal Yaga also scheduled for execution and Japan as a whole becoming more dystopian, it wouldn&#39;t make sense for the high school to have continued its operations as normal or to have been at the center of the series. This makes it unique from many other Shonen Jump series like My Hero Academia, which hang on to their school setting long past the point where it is reasonable for the students to be there. It also allows Jujutsu Kaisen to focus on its action even more.
This will likely also make the series more serious in general. 






 8  Yuta is Back With a Major Role to Play 
Occurred in Episode #23


 







Yuta’s origin story in Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was a great introduction to the character but since he didn’t appear in the main series many fans were confused as to what Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s first protagonist&#39;s role in the story would be. At the end of the Shibuya Incident, Yuta finally makes his triumphant return, partially laying these questions to rest. While he is reintroduced as Yuji’s executioner, it is clear that as one of the few remaining special grade sorcerers they will serve a major role in the series going forward. Especially given his prominent role in the teaser for the recently announced Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3.
It is unclear how Yuta still has access to Rika at this point in the story. 






 7  Yuji’s Newfound Guilt Will Affect His Character Arc 
Occurred in Episode #17
        

Yuji has always had a contentious relationship with Sukuna, but the Shibuya Incident took that to its breaking point. After gaining control of Yuji’s body, Sukuna callously kills a lot of people, all of which Yuji remembers and feels responsible for. This revelation almost broke Yuji when he first regained control, but he was able to fight through it in order to defeat Mahito. However, with the immediate danger now over, Yuji has time to reflect on the carnage his body caused, which is sure to have a major impact on his character arc. This is yet another reason why Yuji is one of Shonen&#39;s most refreshing heroes.





 6  Yuji is Now Being Hunted By Other Sorcerers 
Occurred in Episode #23
        

The response of Jujutsu society to the massive destruction that Sukuna caused in Shibuya is to issue an execution order for his host Yuji, effectively forcing him to go on the run. This is reminiscent of the general attitude toward Yuji displayed at the very beginning of the series, where the only thing preventing his murder was Gojo stepping in and delaying it. While Gojo was around, Yuji was able to make friends and fight with them easily. Now he will be more isolated than ever and have to operate covertly or else he will be hunted down by powerful sorcerers like Yuta.





 5  Sorcery Isn’t In the Shadows Anymore 
Occurred in Episode #23
        

The impact of curses was never solely restricted to the sorcery world, as most victims that Curses claim are generally civilians. However, these attacks have always been few and far between enough to cover up the true nature of these incidents. However, during the Shibuya Incident Curses unleashed such a large amount of destruction that the general public can’t ignore it anymore. With the sorcerer possessing Geto’s body also increasing the amount of Curses and sorcerers running around the country, Japan must necessarily change into a more terrifying and dangerous place. This could make the series’s setting far more dystopian in later arcs.





 4  Nobara is Gone 
Occured in Episode #19


 







Nobara was one of the three main characters at the beginning of Jujutsu Kaisen, serving as a fun contrast to Yuji and Megumi in terms of personality. She was also refreshing in a genre whose female characters have historically been pretty lacking. After Mahito killed her by blowing up part of her face however, it is extremely unlikely that she will return to the series in any meaningful capacity. This is a devastating loss not just for fans but also for Yuji, who was extremely close to Nobara. With her gone his personality may become a lot more serious and he may have less patience with the enemies he fights.
Other allies of Yuji also died, but Nobara was the most significant. 






 3  Gojo is Gone Too 
Occurred in Episode #10
        

Gojo is one of the most powerful characters in the series and his presence alone was enough to deter many of the stronger curses from doing anything too extreme. However, during the Shibuya Incident, Gojo was sealed in a prison realm, which was then taken by the sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body. This means that the protagonists have lost their strongest ally and thus the villains of the series have been emboldened. The higher ups in Jujutsu society, who were also often stymied by Gojo, have also taken this opportunity to enact policies that he would have stopped if he were around, such as the execution orders on Yuji and Yaga. With these antagonists being emboldened, the main goal of the series has shifted to finding the prison realm and getting Gojo back.





 2  The Disaster Curses are Gone As Well 
Their Deaths Occurred Throughout the Season


 







The Disaster Curses were the main antagonists of the series in its first season. Comprised of Hanami, Dagon, Jogo, and Mahito, this group of powerful villains drove a lot of the plot at the beginning of the series and were directly tied to the character arcs of various protagonists. Mahito especially was extremely important in Yuji&#39;s development, shaping his hatred towards curses and also killing many if his friends. But by the end if Shibuya, these important antagonists are all dead leaving the sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body and Sukuna as the only two villains from the start of the show still around. This means Jujutsu Kaisen will likely introduce some major new villains to replace its old ones.





 1  Pseudo-Geto&#39;s Plan Will Change Everything 
Occurred in Episode #23
        

The sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body or Pseudo-Geto as they are often known, ended the Shibuya Incident by creating new sorcerers across Japan. He did this for the stated purpose of having them fight and kill each other and he implied that he has a system in place to make sure they do just that. As manga readers know, this system is the basis for Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s next arc, the Culling Game. The Culling Game becomes the focus of the series for much of its future and has a profound impact on both the plot and the characters. For that reason, the start of the Culling Game is the biggest way that the Shibuya Incident changed Jujutsu Kaisen forever.
