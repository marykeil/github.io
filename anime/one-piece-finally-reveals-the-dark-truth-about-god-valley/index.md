## Literature Review

After years of secrecy, One Piece has finally revealed the appearance of God Valley as well as what led to the infamous God Valley Incident.





Chapter #1095 of One Piece has kicked the series into high gear with the reveal of Kuma&#39;s backstory and a massive lore drop about the infamous God Valley and its tragic history. The God Valley Incident has been one of One Piece&#39;s best-kept secrets and one of the most intriguing events mentioned in the series, second only to the Void Century. However, the latest chapter has finally revealed not only the appearance of the island but also the events preceding the infamous incident covered up by history and the reveal has left fans shocked, to say the least. While earlier assumed to be a simple clash between the Rocks Pirates and the Government, Chapter #1095 reveals there is much more to the God Valley Incident than fans were led to believe.





 God Valley&#39;s History Reveals the Cruelty of the Celestial Dragons 
          

Chapter #1095 of One Piece reveals God Valley was a non-government-affiliated island with abundant resources that was chosen as the site for the Celestial Dragons&#39; triennial manhunt. This terrible bloodsport is a Celestial Dragons&#39; tradition that involved hunting both the citizens of the island and slaves deemed troublesome like Kuma and Ivankov, complete with prizes for whoever accumulated the most kills. The hunt depicted in the flashback happened in the same year as the infamous God Valley Incident, meaning that it was probably a prelude to the attack of the Rocks Pirates and their fight against Garp and Roger.

The reveal of this cruel manhunt brought to light an all-new, even crueler side to the already despicable Celestial Dragons. It seems God Valley was targeted solely for its audacious name with the word &#39;God&#39; in it that the Celestial Dragons - the self-proclaimed gods of the world - found offensive. Moreover, while the Celestial Dragons have always displayed a disregard for all life, this chapter truly highlighted how they are simply inhuman. What remains to be seen is how the Rocks Pirates will get involved and, perhaps more importantly, why Gol D. Roger sided with Garp in defending the Celestial Dragons from their attack.






 The God Valley Incident Will Explain Many One Piece Mysteries 
         

The God Valley Incident is among the most anticipated flashbacks in One Piece, because it connects to many of the lingering mysteries of the series. Fans can only hope this flashback is a long one and exposes the full truth about the God Valley Incident, including the involvement of Rocks D. Xebec and the long-awaited clash between the Roger Pirates and the Rocks Pirates. Clearly, God Valley plays a key role in the history of One Piece, and fans will only have to wait a little more to learn everything about it.
