## Literature Review

Boruto finally shows how the protagonist got the scar displayed in the flash-forward, and it was the price to pay to save someone very dear to him.




Boruto&#39;s first chapter started with a flash-forward showing the title character with a scar over one eye, naturally leading many fans to wonder what the explanation for the wound was. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that Boruto got his scar from Kawaki, but he did so while trying to save a person very dear to him.




In chapter #78 of Boruto, Kawaki ambushes his former &#34;brother&#34; Boruto, following up on his declared intention of killing him to save Naruto and Konoha from Momoshiki Otsutsuki, who is trying to take over Boruto&#39;s body.

          

Sarada, who has only just learned that Boruto was killed (and then resurrected) by Kawaki during their battle against Code, intervenes to save her friend. However, Kawaki overpowers her and is about to cut her down when Boruto jumps in and pushes Sarada out of the way, getting a nasty scar on his right eye and cheek in the process.

The scar on the protagonist&#39;s eye was first seen in the flash-forward that teased Boruto&#39;s future fight against Kawaki, shown in the first chapter of the manga. Fans have been wondering since then how it happened, especially considering the mystery surrounding Boruto&#39;s right eye, which transforms into a Byakugan when Momoshiki takes over his body, and into a Jogan in the flash-forward. Now it&#39;s clear that the scar is the first shot fired in the much-awaited battle between Boruto and Kawaki, which will be the main focus of the manga going forward.

Boruto and Sarada&#39;s actions in this chapter reinforce the bond between the two, which was sadly overshadowed by other plot lines in the manga. There has been a lot of speculation about a possible romance between Boruto and Sarada but signs of it have been few and far between. Sarada&#39;s determination in trying to save Boruto, and the latter&#39;s sacrifice of an eye in order to save her, however, create the perfect background for their relationship to blossom into something different. This sets the stage perfectly for their relationship to develop further in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex

What makes this development so remarkable is how effortlessly it sets up the series&#39; second part Two Blue Vortex. By having Boruto obtain his scar by protecting Sarada from Kawaki, it advances two relationships that will be key for Boruto&#39;s character arc going forward. Though fans already know Boruto&#39;s conflict with Kawaki will come to a head, what&#39;s less clear is what will happen between the title character and Sarada. The youngest Uchiha has certainly shown her devotion to Boruto after he&#39;s been shunned by Konoha, so it will be interesting to see their relationship develop further.

Regardless of what Boruto&#39;s scar means for the future though, it&#39;s a stark reminder of his character development. The carefree young ninja who only wanted to be different from his dad is completely gone, replaced by someone exiled and hated. The real explanation behind Boruto&#39;s scar is to show how far he&#39;s come and to hint at the lengths he&#39;ll go to in order to protect his possible love interest Sarada.
