# Highly Anticipated Yuri Anime Suffers Unfortunate Delay


## SUMMARY 



  The highly anticipated Whisper Me a Love Song anime adaptation has been delayed by three months, disappointing fans who were looking forward to its release in January 2024.   The delay may be due to technical issues and production problems behind the scenes, including a change in director and a new studio co-producing the series. These changes raise concerns about the visual and technical quality of the anime.   Whisper Me a Love Song is a wholesome Yuri story that is very popular among fans of LGBTQ&#43; manga.

## Literature Review

Whisper Me a Love Song&#39;s anime adaptation has been hotly anticipated by LGBTQ&#43; anime fans, but unfortunately, the series is set to suffer a big delay.




The much-anticipated Whisper Me a Love Song anime adaptation suffers an unfortunate delay, much to fans&#39; dismay. Whisper Me a Love Song centers around high school freshman Himari who, after watching a band perform on the first day of school, tells their vocalist Yori that she fell in love with her voice, but Yori misunderstood it as a confession of love. What follows is a wholesome Yuri story that never spins its wheels with its relationships, and it quickly became a staple among fans of LGBTQ&#43; manga.




The upcoming anime adaptation of Whisper Me a Love Song has drawn even more attention toward the series, but it’s, unfortunately, set to suffer a major delay. While it was initially set to premiere in January 2024, the Whisper Me a Love Song anime has now been delayed three months and won’t air until April 2024.


 

Considering how little promotional material there has been, it makes sense for the series to be delayed, and while that won’t affect the story in any way, some of the more technical issues of the delay unfortunately don’t bode well for how the anime will play out.

                  2023 is Already Anime&#39;s Best Year For LGBTQ&#43; Representation   LGBTQ&#43; representation has gradually been becoming a bigger part of anime, and 2023 has already proven itself to be the best year for it, yet.   





 Whisper Me A Love Song’s Problems Go Beyond A Change In Release Date 
          

Even worse than Whisper Me a Love Song’s delay, however, are the various issues going on with its production. In addition to Akira Mano replacing Xin Ya Cai as director, Cloud Hearts is now co-producing the anime alongside Yokohama Animation Lab instead of animating it on its own. All of that suggests that Whisper Me a Love Song is suffering serious production issues behind the scenes, and the fact that it’s been delayed for an entire season of anime suggests that it’s going to have a lot of problems on a visual and technical level, even with the various staff changes.

                  The 10 Best LGBTQ&#43; Characters From Anime &amp; Manga   There have been countless LGBTQ and queer coded characters in anime and manga over the years. Here are the ten best according to ScreenRant!   




There are some upsides to the various changes in production that have been announced, however. Akira Mano replacing Xin Ya Cai as director, for example, was solely because of health issues that prevented Xin Ya Cai from working on the series, so that might not be an issue. Additionally, Cloud Hearts is a fairly new studio with only two productions before Whisper Me a Love Song, so having another studio co-produce the series can help put less stress on the animators. None of that changes the inherent issues with the staff changes, but it does suggest that Whisper Me a Love Song’s production might not be in entirely bad shape.



 Whisper Me A Love Song’s Delay Is Unfortunately Typical Of The Anime Industry 
          

Whisper Me a Love Song’s delay and overall production issues are certainly unfortunate, and what’s worse is how typical they are of the anime industry. Anime production has become increasingly difficult due to studios overextending themselves and animators being overworked, and 2023, in particular, saw numerous anime like Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead being delayed for weeks and months on end. It’s unknown if Whisper Me a Love Song is having similar issues, but the fact that there are issues at all still adds to the ongoing toxicity of modern anime production, and with any luck, its delay will be the least of its problems.
