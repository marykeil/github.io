## Literature Review

Fan of the hit anime Bocchi the Rock! but can&#39;t get enough? Here are a few great recommendations for those looking for similar titles.





Never having collaborated with other musicians, she must not only learn to socialize and sync her playing up with her new bandmates but also to perform in front of a live audience. As one of the best anime about rock bands with an introverted main character and the entire first season already out, fans are left wondering what to watch next. Some turn to classics such as Kimi ni Todoke, while others search for more eccentric comedies like Welcome To The N.H.K. One thing is certain, these anime will undoubtedly scratch the lingering itch after finishing all 12 episodes of Bocchi the Rock!









 








 Super Cub 
Stream on Funimation
        

Following the mysterious life of high schooler Koguma, a lonesome girl without any friends or family, Super Cub is the wholesome tale of an adolescent gaining a hobby in her used Super Cub motor scooter that leads her to find her people. The anime&#39;s minimalistic approach perfectly highlights Koguma&#39;s mundane life which gains color as she cherishes her scooter and evolving social life.
The title is a great laid-back slice-of-life anime that shares similar themes with Bocchi the Rock!, such as introversion and breaking out of one&#39;s shell to create lasting bonds with people sharing common interests. Instead of tuning a guitar like Bocchi, Koguma looks for ways to improve her Super Cub and travels around her prefecture with her newfound motor-scooter-enthusiast friends, slowly developing her personality along the way.





 Mob Psycho 100 
Stream on Crunchyroll
        

Fourteen-year-old Shigeo &#34;Mob&#34; Kageyama is anything but conventional, and it&#39;s no secret. Gifted with psychic powers that can be difficult to suppress, Mob doesn&#39;t fit in anywhere, deciding to take matters into his own hands and seek out a mentor. Taken under the wing of fake psychic and con artist Reigen Arataka, Mob is continually exploited for money as he gets himself into risky situations, striving to find control and impress a girl.
Able to tap into a geyser of borderline horrifying psychic powers throughout Mob Psycho, certain triggers cause Mob to completely lose control and make him capable of defeating the most heinous spirits on the planet. Mob Psycho 100 exhibits distinct humor and animation that is as impressive as it is hilarious, much like Bocchi the Rock! Mob himself finds it impossible to be normal and is socially awkward, with visible anxiety when interacting with peers, comparable to Bocchi.

 Welcome To The N.H.K. 
Stream On Funimation
        

Satou Tatsuhiro is a college dropout conspiracy theorist who became an expert hikikomori and NEET (Not pursuing Employment, Education, or Training) by shutting himself away from the outside world, only leaving his house life&#39;s absolute necessities.


Wholeheartedly believing that a giant organization called the N.H.K. has the sole job of sabotaging every single aspect of his life and making sure he stays a shut-in, Satou is terrified of what might happen if he tries living a traditional life, but knows he can&#39;t continue along the same path he&#39;s been taking. Welcome to the N.H.K. may not be the darkest anime out there, due to its many humorous moments and unique facial expressions of the main character, making it comparable to Bocchi the Rock!, but it tackles some surprisingly serious subjects in a painfully realistic way.

 The 10 Best Revenge-Driven Characters In Anime 
Revenge is a common theme in anime and many series have characters with revenge-driven motives. Here are the best ones.








 WataMote 
Stream on Crunchyroll
        

Starring one of the creepiest anime kids, Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (better known as WataMote) is about otaku gamer Tomoko Kuroki, a misunderstood teenage girl who thinks her thousands of playthroughs of life and dating simulation games have completely prepared her for high school. Believing that she&#39;s guaranteed to become popular, despite being awkward and introverted, Tomoki faces a rude awakening.
WataMote is often regarded as a more hilariously cringe and unusual version of Bocchi the Rock!, minus the music. However, instead of growing past these obstacles like Bocchi, Tomoki stays relatively the same. Both protagonists eventually make good friends while showcasing telltale signs of crippling social anxiety.





 Komi Can&#39;t Communicate 
Stream on Netflix
        

Tadano Hitohito wants nothing more than to have a normal high school life and avoid controversy. Unbeknownst to him, his seat is assigned next to Komi, the prettiest girl in class. Regarded as one of the best high school anime, Komi Can&#39;t Communicate shows Tadano being targeted by his peers, who would do anything to take his place.
What really makes the anime a lot like Bocchi the Rock! is Komi herself, who has paralyzing anxiety and communication difficulties, making her unable to socialize with her classmates. Communicating through notes and blackboards, Tadano decides to help Komi become more social and achieve her dream of making a hundred friends, starting with him. Bocchi and Komi both work towards similar goals in order to become more socially comfortable, each episode featuring cute yet hilarious reactions from their leading ladies.

 Kimi Ni Todoke 
Stream on Netflix &amp; Crunchyroll
        

An anime that&#39;s perfect for beginners, Kimi ni Todoke focuses on the story of Sawako Kuronuma, an extremely shy high school girl who is misunderstood and outcast by her class for looking like Sadako from The Ring series. Even though she is actually extraordinarily kind, people associate her with the murderous horror antagonist and don&#39;t associate with her, until popular student Shouta Kazehaya gives her the opportunity to turn it all around.
Like Sawako, Bocchi also aspires to be more personable. The innocent Sawako befriends classmates Chizuru and Ayane, much in the way that Bocchi befriends her bandmates. The two are equally relatable to those with corresponding social awkwardness, each slowly but surely transforming into their ideal selves, but still preserving their original charm.





 Hitoribocchi No Marumaru Seikatsu 
Stream On Crunchyroll
        

Even sharing a name with Bocchi, Hitoribocchi No Marumaru Seikatsu presents the life of Hitori Bocchi in one of the best short anime series. As a girl with serious social anxiety transitioning from elementary to middle school and separating from her only friend, Kai, Hitori is promised that if she can befriend all of her classmates, Kai will reconcile with her.
With that, Hitori sets her sights on victory, but it won&#39;t be an easy one. Much like Bocchi the Rock!, this anime portrays the often comical reactions of an adorable girl struggling to overcome her fear of socializing, equipped with reactions like fainting when overwhelmed and feeling nauseous when nervous. Though Hitori doesn&#39;t want to be a musician, she and Bocchi both spend time in their respective anime desperately trying to make friends.

 Kids On The Slope 
Stream on Crunchyroll
        

Kids on the Slope focuses on classic music more than rock, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t similar to Bocchi the Rock! After starting his first year of high school away from his hometown, introverted pianist Kaoru Nishimi has given up on trying to blend in, bracing himself for yet another lonely year.
Suddenly, he runs into delinquent Sentarou Kawabuchi, who encourages the talented pianist to join him in after-school jazz sessions. Through this joint experience, Kaoru discovers what sharing his music with others can bring him, bonding with friends and finding love in the process. Kids on the Slope&#39;s humbling theme of belonging and impressive musical score make it a great follow-up anime to Bocchi the Rock!, given their equal messages. Though it lacks the same humor, this anime makes up for it with a nurturing story and a wonderful ending.





 Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! 
Stream on Netflix &amp; Crunchyroll
        

Arguably the greatest slice-of-life club anime of the year 2020, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! outlines the unique story of Midori Asakusa, an artist who has dedicated her life to illustrating vibrant landscapes from the world around her and her own imagination. When she and her funds-obsessed best friend Kanamori have a chance encounter with a popular model who loves drawing the human form, they create a motion picture club.


Instead of concentrating on music like Bocchi, Midori and friends showcase the key aspects of successful animations that are as moving as they are distinct. Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!&#39;s giggle-inducing facial expressions and awkward yet accurate portrayal of adolescence using the adorably timid main character mirror the same engaging style of Bocchi the Rock!, which differentiates itself from any other club anime thus far, resulting in heartwarming self-acceptance.
