The Shibuya Incident Arc revealed a surprising twist, with the true mastermind behind the plot being an ancient jujutsu sorcerer named Kenjaku who possessed Geto&#39;s body. However, Geto was momentarily able to resist the possession after Gojo&#39;s heartfelt plea.

## Literature Review

Itadori being able to control Sukuna was a huge mystery early in Jujutsu Kaisen, but one scene in the Shibuya Incident Arc hints at an answer.




Jujutsu Kaisen excels at setting up mysteries that keep fans wondering for a long time. The show has many mysteries it hasn&#39;t answered yet, such as why Yuta can still summon Rika or the requirements to attain a Domain Expansion, but one of the most intriguing ones so far is how Yuji Itadori was able to prevent Sukuna from completely taking over his body.




The Shibuya Incident Arc has been incredible so far, with twists and turns that left viewers on the edge of their seats. One of the biggest plot twists in the arc was the reveal of the true mastermind behind the Shibuya plot. It was thought that Geto was spearheading the operation, but it turns out that it was an ancient jujutsu sorcerer, Kenjaku, who possessed Geto&#39;s body after he died.

          

The reveal was very shocking and it was obviously at the center of attention, especially considering it led to Gojo being sealed inside Prison Realm. However, behind the insane reveal is a subtle hint that gives a clue as to why Itadori might have been able to resist Sukuna&#39;s possession earlier in the series.

                  One Jujutsu Kaisen Scene Hints That a Character Is Bigger Than Fans Thought   The second season of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s anime has hinted that a seemingly minor character may actually be much more important than fans think.   





 Geto Resisting Kenjaku&#39;s Control Is Reminiscent Of Sukuna And Itadori 
          

Without spoiling too much on the manga contents for anime-only viewers, Kenjaku has been effortlessly taking over the bodies of many people for hundreds of years. However, when Gojo made a plea to Geto in episode #34, hoping he&#39;d hear him and resist Kenjaku&#39;s control, shockingly, Geto&#39;s hand strangled Kenjaku, leaving the latter puzzled that his host body was able to gain control of even the arm. This scene displays just how close Geto and Gojo were, but Geto fighting for control somehow explains Itadori not succumbing to Sukuna when he ate his finger at the start of the series.

The trigger for Geto&#39;s awakening and gaining partial control was Gojo&#39;s plea. Similarly, when Itadori ate the finger and Sukuna incarnated, his friends were all in danger, and he was desperate to save them. Both Geto and Itadori managed to win control because they were trying to help their friends who were in trouble. An emotion so strong as to save someone else seems to be needed to resist being controlled by potent curses. Although this theory has no proof besides these two instances, a pattern is forming that can&#39;t be ignored.




          

The creator of Jujutsu Kaisen​​​​​​, Gege Akutami, has said quite a few times that he is just making things up as he goes, most notably when it comes to the power system. This could be another instance where he was just freestyling and wasn&#39;t really trying to hint at anything, so it is important to take this theory with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, Gege is brilliant at foreshadowing and is an excellent author, so there is a very real chance that this scene was done on purpose. Hopefully, before Jujutsu Kaisen ends, he can finally explain who exactly Yuji Itadori is and how he was able to suppress Sukuna, the most powerful curse ever.
