## Literature Review

From vampires to shapeshifters to spirits, many anime heroes find themselves in supernatural romances with a fantastical creature.




The best supernatural romance anime explore every facet of what it might be like to fall in love with a magical or even monstrous creature. From vampires and werewolves to celestial beings like gods, romance anime often proves that there is literally someone, or something, for everyone.
Ideally, one lover&#39;s supernatural nature, or the circumstances of the pair&#39;s meeting and falling in love shouldn&#39;t just be set dressing. Supernatural romances, by nature, allow a story to have particularly high stakes and reach heights that fans don&#39;t get from more grounded slice-of-life love stories. The only limits are the creators&#39; imagination.









 








 10  Princess Mononoke 
Created by Studio Ghibli and written by Hayao Miyazaki
        

Like many of the best Studio Ghibli couples, San and Ashitaka meet through supernatural circumstances. In searching for the source of his fatal curse, Ashitaka discovers a brewing war between humans and spirits, and comes into contact with San, the vengeful daughter of the wolf spirits. Fighting for their own ideals, the two soon come to rely on and love one another.
As Ashitaka struggles with the curse stealing his life, San viciously rejects her own humanity at every opportune moment, to varying success as the movie goes on. Ashitaka was enamored by San the moment he laid eyes on her. San takes much longer to let down her guard around a human, but after watching Ashitaka risk his life over and over, she feels safe enough to admit affection for him.

They claim that a mysterious white-haired girl, Angel, is their enemy, but the more Otonashi tries to get to know her, the more he realizes that none of them have any idea what this place really is.

Though they helped make each other&#39;s dreams come true, in life and death, the question hangs in the air of whether their souls will ever find one another again.

 5  Future Diary 
Created by Asread, based on the manga by Sakae Esuno


God is dying, and needs a successor. To this end, he devises a game, selects twelve human players, and informs them that the last survivor inherits his position. Weak and unassuming Yukiteru Amane is terrified, believing he has no chance, but not to worry: Yuki&#39;s greatest weapon is another player, Yuno Gasai, who is madly in love with him.
Whatever Yuki and Yuno have going on isn&#39;t exactly a romance to aspire to, but it&#39;s a love story nonetheless. Yuno is viciously possessive of Yuki and raring to kill anyone who could take him away, and Yuki, in spite of himself, becomes protective of Yuno in turn. The two go from total non-contenders to one of the best battle couples in anime.

 4  Into The Forest Of Fireflies&#39; Light 
Created by Brain Base, based on the manga by Yuki Midorikawa
        

Midorikawa is also the author of another well-known supernatural manga: Natsume Yuujinchou. 

From childhood to adolescence, Hotaru spent her summers in the mountains with a very unusual friend. The mask Gin wears and his family of spirits aren&#39;t even close to the strangest thing about him. The two can never touch each other, because if Gin ever comes into contact with a human, he will disappear forever.
There are many anime based on Japanese mythology and folklore, and Into the Forest of Fireflies&#39; Light is an excellent example. Gin is an abandoned human turned youkai, and as they grow up together, he and Hotaru become each other&#39;s most important people. Even after their visits end, it’s clear that the love Hotaru felt for Gin made her time with him the most special of her life.

 3  Noragami 
Based on the manga by Adachitoka
        

When she risks her own life to push what she thinks is a normal boy out of the way of a speeding bus, Hiyori Iki survives, but is forever changed. The boy she saved was actually the centuries-old god Yato, and her brush with death has given her the ability to leave her body and interact with the spirit world. Now, the pair&#39;s lives are intertwined.
While romance isn&#39;t the core focus of Noragami, much of the story runs on the love growing between Yato and Hiyori. The supernatural world spurns Yato for his many failings as a minor god, but Hiyori never loses faith in him. Yato eventually feels safe enough with her and his weapon partner Yukine to extend them his trust and open up about his tragic background.

 2  Howl’s Moving Castle 
Created by Studio Ghibli, based on the Moving Castle novels by Diane Wynne Jones


 







The other girls in town have told Sophie stories of the mysterious wizard Howl, who seduces beautiful young women and eats their hearts. Shy and insecure, Sophie is sure she&#39;s safe from him, but ends up running into a spiteful witch instead. In an even bigger twist, the infamous wizard steps in to break her new found curse.
Howl&#39;s Moving Castle is a fan-favorite Studio Ghibli movie for many reasons. Chief among them is the thrilling and heartfelt romance between Sophie and Howl. The two complement each other perfectly, from Sophie&#39;s steadfast will and refusal to be pushed around by Howl&#39;s dramatics, to Howl&#39;s bluntness coming in handy when he&#39;s telling Sophie exactly how highly he really thinks of her.

 1  Fruits Basket 
Originally created by Natsuki Takaya


 







Fruits Basket has had two anime adaptations, one in 2001 and a reboot in 2019. 

At first glance, Fruits Basket is a quirky fantasy about a family cursed to turn into animals of the Chinese Zodiac whenever they hug a member of the opposite gender. Scratch the surface even a little, and the darkness underneath becomes clear. The Zodiac curse is representative of the abuse and trauma passed down from one generation of Sohmas to the next, and it&#39;s up to Tohru and the youngest Sohmas to break it for good.
Though Tohru&#39;s budding romance with Kyo, the ostracized Cat of the Zodiac, is the heart of the show, Fruits Basket features several romantic relationships. Between Yuki and Machi, Hatori and Mayuko, and Hatsuharu and Rin, each relationship helps both lovers involved heal from the wounds of their past and become stronger as they take on the future together.
