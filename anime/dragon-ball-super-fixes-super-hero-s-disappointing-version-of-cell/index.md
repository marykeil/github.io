## Literature Review

The Dragon Ball Super manga is trying to flesh out Cell Max&#39;s character after his lackluster appearance in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.





The Dragon Ball Super manga has taken Cell Max and attempted to redeem him by giving him a more logical method to his madness. While he&#39;s still a lumbering beast in the beginning of his battle, he surprises his opponents, spectators, and readers by showing an ability to learn and adapt to the situation, reflecting more of the original Cell.





 Dragon Ball Super Gives Cell Max More Depth 
          

During the first round of the fight, Cell Max doesn&#39;t have a good grasp of how to handle himself or his powers. It&#39;s mentioned that this is likely due to him having just woken up; he&#39;s still getting used to how to move around, rendering him sluggish and clumsy. Goten, Trunks, and the Gammas use this to their advantage and seem to defeat him. But then, Cell Max retaliates. Suddenly, he&#39;s maneuvering behind the heroes and moving too quickly for anyone to get a proper hit on him. He manages to deflect many of their attacks, showing that he&#39;s learning everyone&#39;s fighting styles and adapting his own moves to compensate.

This is what Super Hero&#39;s audiences expected from Cell Max in the movie. The spectator&#39;s comments that Cell Max is &#34;getting used to fighting&#34; and has &#34;changed up his moves&#34; is a callback to the original Cell fans remember, mirroring his ability to adapt and copy his opponents move sets. This gradual adaptation from Cell Max also adds depth to the film&#39;s bland iteration of the character. It gives him a twist - he can do what the original Cell could, but at a slower pace, with more thought and effort needed - helping him stand out as his own character and not just some clone.

Cell Max and his disorganized, sloppy fighting style in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero left him feeling like an anticlimactic villain. The manga seems to be fixing that by adding their own spin on the character. While still retaining some of his imperfections, Cell Max is also showing signs of being more competent and calculated, much like the original Cell. In fact, by playing into his initial clumsiness and having him slowly adapt to his enemies as compared to the original, the manga makes him stand out as his own character. Dragon Ball Super&#39;s version of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&#39;s final villain may breathe new life into Cell&#39;s most disappointing iteration.
