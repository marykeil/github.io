## SUMMARY 



  Jujutsu Kaisen breaks shonen tradition by focusing on a comedic battle between Takaba and Kenjaku, showcasing the author&#39;s unique storytelling style.   The interlude about Japanese stand-up comedy amid the main storyline may seem random, but Akutami makes it worth reading.   This unexpected approach is what made Jujutsu Kaisen popular, revolutionizing the shōnen genre while staying true to its most appreciated tropes.

## Literature Review

After a spellbinding battle between Gojo and Sukuna, to fans’ surprise, Jujutsu Kaisen switches gears completely with a fight revolving around comedy.




Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for Jujutsu Kaisen #241Yhe perfect follow-up to the biggest, most anticipated fight in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s history is not an even bigger, more epic clash, in typical shōnen manga fashion, but rather a battle pitting the saga&#39;s more bizarre characters, Takaba, against the series&#39; true villain - Kenjaku. Switching the focus to this head-scratching sub-plot seems oddly mistaken, that is unless one understands Akutami&#39;s asymmetric creative style and love for spurning shōnen manga traditions.




One of the time-worn traditions of shōnen superhero and battle manga is the &#34;big fight&#34;. Built up over weeks, months, or even years, the big fight is the contest fans most anticipate at any specific point in the story. The fight always leads to a major change or disruption in the story.

         

Indeed, just as common to the big fight is the consequential aftermath. The story of the aftermath can take many forms, but it is almost always connected to or deals with the reverberations of the just-fought battle. At the very least, it certainly does not go off on a seemingly unrelated tangent about Japanese stand-up comedy.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Forces Popular Manga To Go On Hiatus Out Of Shock   The events of Jujutsu Kaisen chapter #236 have left a major mark on fans of the series, and they&#39;ve even caused a popular manga to go on hiatus.   





 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Next Big Fight Is All About Comedy 
          

Gege Akutami flips the script on that tradition in Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter #241. Indeed, after the death of the story&#39;s most popular character, Satoru Gojo, at the hands of Ryomen Sukuna, no one would expect Jujutsu Kaisen to move the focus to a fight between Takaba and Kenjaku, where Takaba promises to make Kenjaku laugh. This goes against the traditions that manga fans have become accustomed to, but it&#39;s nothing new for Jujutsu Kaisen.

Akutami&#39;s history of weird side tales outside the normal flow of the story is well-known to followers of the manga. The Kenjaku - Takaba interlude certainly breaks away from the main storyline, but not in a random, haphazard manner as to be considered filler. Indeed, Akutami either has a deep interest in Japanese comedy because he drops some informative details on the subject through his explanation of Takaba&#39;s background. Moreover, Akutami has an uncannily creative way of weaving these interludes back into the main story.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Creator&#39;s Unique But Frustrating Style Made The Series A Success 
          

This style of storytelling usually leaves Jujutsu Kaisen fans emotionally jilted. Considering the apocalyptic fight between Gojo and Sukuna that just ended, the decision to have Kenjaku fight Takaba, and make comedy the focus of their battle, is one that no one could have anticipated. This brand of creativity, however, is exactly what made Jujutsu Kaisen so popular, allowing the series to revolutionize the shonen genre while remaining faithful to its most appreciated tropes.
