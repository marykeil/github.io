 10  Muichiro and Gyokko&#39;s Showdown Showed Off the Hashira&#39;s Strength 
Demon Slayer Season 4, Episode #9


 







Although season 4 of Demon Slayer didn&#39;t quite live up to the excitement and hype of previous seasons, the fierce battle between Muichiro and Gyokko was one of the best the series has to offer. The extremely gifted and young Muichiro finally made an appearance after Tengen Uzui, one of the strongest Hashira, praised his strength in season 3, and he was able to exceed the expectations set on him. What made this fight even more memorable was that Muichiro had to deal with his amnesia to remember who he truly was, and only then was he able to defeat a centuries-old demon.

 9  Rukia&#39;s fight with As Nodt Gave Her the Chance To Prove Her Worth 
Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War episode #19


Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War&#39;s second part was definitely filled with many highlights: Kenpachi&#39;s toughest battle, Senjumaru&#39;s breathtaking Bankai, and Ichigo&#39;s appearance. However, nothing made fans happier than Rukia finally getting her time to shine and reach the level of a captain. She fought against someone who had defeated her older brother before: As Nodt, the Quincy with an ability to strike fear into an opponent&#39;s heart. While it seemed as though Rukia would lose when As Nodt used his full power, she gained an advantage once Byakuya helped her regain confidence and clarity, proceeding to use the series&#39; most beautiful Bankai.

 8  Mereleona and Princia&#39;s Death Match Made the Black Clover Movie Memorable 
Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King


Black Clover&#39;s hit movie was action-packed from start to finish, which makes sense considering how multiple Wizard Kings were reincarnated as the main villains featured throughout. It is a known fact that anime movies tend to have higher quality animation compared to their seasonal counterparts, but nobody expected the high level of production on Black Clover Sword of the Wizard King. Highlighting two powerful women who love nothing more than fighting, Mereleona&#39;s death match with Princia saw the two facing off in one of the best fights in the franchise.

 7  Kawaki Was the Only One Who Could Face Off Against Momoshiki 
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations episode #292


One thing that the Naruto franchise will always be unmatched in is the intense hand-to-hand combat that is prevalent in the fight scenes. With Boruto being possessed by Momoshiki, the only one who had a shot at stopping him was Kawaki, who had every intention of killing Boruto and Momoshiki. This incredible fight paid homage to the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke, with a few shots being directly from Naruto&#39;s most legendary battle. With an abundance of fluid and dynamic sequences, the intense fight also has dazzling visuals and ninjutsu techniques that all the more serve to heighten the experience before the anime&#39;s ending.

 6  Eren Facing Off Against His Dearest Friends In Attack On Titan&#39;s Finale 
Attack On Titan Final Season: The Final Chapters


With Eren massacring 80 percent of the human population, his friends and enemies chose to join forces to stop the genocidal maniac. The finale of Attack On Titan was a masterpiece, perfectly including everything that made the series one of the best. From the intricate twists and shocking moments to the high-quality animation, the fight between Eren and his former best friends lasted more than 30 minutes, and every second of it was a pleasure to witness. To wrap up more than ten years of a groundbreaking story, Mikasa and Levi take down Eren in a tragic scene, which is ironic considering the two have gone through many life-and-death situations to protect him.

 5  Itadori and Todo Take Revenge On Mahito 
Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episodes #20-21


 







Itadori, distraught over the death of Nanami and Nobara at the hands of Mahito, lost all will to fight and accepted his death. Miraculously, Todo appeared, not only saving Itadori&#39;s life, but also motivating him to stand up and join him to fight. With their incredible chemistry, Todo and Itadori went on to have an even battle against Mahito that resulted in Todo losing his cursed technique, but also Mahito&#39;s demise. What made this fight a game changer is that it signaled a turning point for Itadori&#39;s character arc. The scene of Yuji mercilessly pursuing a pleading Mahito remains one of the best shown in this packed season.

 4  Snake Challenged Thorfinn&#39;s Newly Adopted Philosophy 
Vinland Saga season 2, episode #17


Vinland Saga&#39;s second season was one of the best anime from 2023, despite being the complete opposite of the action-packed and violent first season. Following Thorfinn facing his demons, a series of events leads to a journey of pacifism, swearing never to use violence again. The second half of the season challenged this ideology, and he later realized that he was wrong. His fight against the extremely skilled and vengeful Snake led him to the conclusion that violence should only be used to protect himself and his loved ones, and even then it should not be fatal. For fans who wanted action after a slow-paced season, they got just that, and it showed that Vinland Saga was still one of the best action anime out there.

 3  Luffy and Kaido&#39;s Final Battle Marked a Monumental Moment in One Piece History 
One Piece episode #1074


While each fight between Luffy and Kaido became more exciting as the anime progressed, their final fight in Onigashima was the perfect sendoff for the Wano arc. Luffy, in his iconic Gear 5, finally had a chance to win against Kaido, and although the first episode of Luffy&#39;s transformation was great, it was in episode #1074 that Luffy&#39;s awakened form was finally able to push his abilities to their limit. With the ability to use lightning, deflect almost any attack, and turn anything he touches into rubber, there were no limits to how wild the conclusive fight could be.

 2  Zoro and King&#39;s Battle Has the Best Animation in the Franchise 
One Piece episode #1062


In an anime that saw Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 literally breaking the internet, Zoro&#39;s epic showdown with King still managed to stand out as one of the most memorable moments in the Wano Arc. As the top commanders of their respective crews, their fight was highliy-anticipated and the duel was one of the best-animated battles in One Piece so far. Toei Animation recruited many of the best animators in the industry, such as Vincent Chansard, Weiling Zhan, YenBM, and more. The Wano arc had the best animation in the whole series, but Zoro and King&#39;s fight was taken to a whole other level. The fact that it managed to not get overshadowed by the following battle between Luffy and Kaido is a monumental feat on its own.

 1  Sukuna and Mahoraga Redefined What a Fight Could Be 
Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, episode #17
        

If there&#39;s one fight that perfectly explains just how chaotic the Shibuya Incident arc is, it is the showdown between the King of Curses and the strongest Ten Shadow creature. After almost all his attacks, including a Domain Expansion, proved ineffective against the beast, Sukuna let out the most fiery and intense fire attack that destroyed a huge part of the district. Sukuna concluded the haunting moment by taunting Itadori by showing him what he did and all the damage caused while he controlled his body. From the incredible animation to the majestic and eerie soundtrack, the 20-minute fight between Sukuna and Mahoraga is not just the best fight of 2023, but one of the best anime fights of all time.
