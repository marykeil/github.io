## Literature Review

The most interesting anime villains are not the ones who are 100% evil, but those who exist in shades of gray.




The best morally gray anime villains are some of the most complex characters in fiction. As fun as it can be to watch a cartoonishly evil villain cause mayhem, they often aren&#39;t as true to life as the more dubious ones. Audiences are drawn to anime characters with moral ambiguity because they are ultimately the most human.
Compared to Western mainstream media, anime has historically been more willing to grapple with the uncomfortable and ambiguous sides of a character. These villains challenge the viewer&#39;s notions of right and wrong, and allow audiences to work through their own inner demons in a healthy manner. For well-rounded characters with unique personalities and motivations, don&#39;t miss out on this cast of characters.









 








 10  Moriarty Helps Commoners Get Revenge on the Aristocracy 
Moriarty the Patriot (2020)
        

Crime consultant William James Moriarty uses his remarkable intelligence to turn England&#39;s class system on its head. He helps the lower classes get revenge on the aristocracy, and often flies under the radar due to his refinement and charisma. Having been abused in his past, he is gentle and sympathetic towards those who have suffered similarly. In keeping with the Sherlock Holmes tradition, Moriarty also plays cat-and-mouse with a certain legendary consulting detective. For one of the best anime adaptations of classic literature and a nuanced take on its main villain, Moriarty the Patriot is well worth the watch.

 9  Ugetsu is Moody and Unstable Around Those He Loves 
Given (2019)
        

Ugetsu is an antagonist who does not perceive himself as such. A violin prodigy and quite perceptive of others&#39; feelings, he generally comes across as sleepy and cheerful. Alarmingly, Ugetsu can become unstable under pressure; he often throws and breaks things around him and even physically abuses his boyfriend, Akihiko. Though Ugetsu is more of a side character in the initial 11-episode series, the Given movie provides an in-depth exploration of his and Akihiko&#39;s relationship. While Given is more about interpersonal relationships and working through one&#39;s pain, Ugetsu is as close to a morally gray villain as the series gets.

 8  Lunatic&#39;s Sense of Justice Was Shaped By His Father 
Tiger &amp; Bunny (2011, 2022)
        

For someone who manages a group of heroes, Yuri Petrov&#39;s morality is decidedly murky. Operating under the alias Lunatic, he frequently clashes with Stern Bild&#39;s heroes, including Tiger and Bunny themselves. Lunatic believes that true evil must be eliminated at all costs, which has led him to make some extreme decisions, including burning to death those he perceives to be villains. His twisted morality stems from his upbringing, when he saw his father beating his mother and vowed from then on never to turn a blind eye to evil.

 7  Su-Won Sought Revenge for an Understandable Reason 
Yona of the Dawn (2014)
        

Many viewers reacted with extreme shock during episode #1 of Yona of the Dawn when the mellow Su-Won murdered Emperor II, the father of his childhood friend, Yona. This act was motivated by the alleged murder of his own father at the hands of the Emperor himself, further complicating the situation. Though Su-Won&#39;s actions set the entire series into motion, he still appears to feel affection for the former Crown princess. Yona, too, seems to understand Su-Won&#39;s motivations and finds herself struggling with whether to forgive him.

 6  Shigure is Sly and Motivated By Self-Interest 
Fruits Basket (2001, 2019)
        

While not precisely an anime villain, Shigure is the most morally questionable member of the Sohma clan. His relationship with the series&#39; antagonist, Akito, is ordained by fate, but many would argue that it stems equally from his own desires and motivations. Shigure always puts himself first and considers what he has to gain from any interaction. Even when teasing Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo, he has a purpose behind it, whether to ease the tension or to amuse himself. As he is the only Sohma member without a fully fleshed-out backstory, it is difficult to say how much of his actions stem from the family&#39;s generational trauma.

 5  Yut-Lung is More Than a Conniving Mastermind, He&#39;s a Traumatized Child 
Banana Fish (2018)


 







Banana Fish has been praised for its depiction of trauma survivors, not only in the portrayal of protagonist Ash Lynx, but with his foil, Yut-Lung Lee. While Yut-Lung initially seems more quietly devious, it is revealed that he is prone to violent fits of jealousy, especially regarding Ash&#39;s relationship with Eiji Okumura. Viewers soon learn, however, that Yut-Lung experienced a similar trauma to Ash, but never had an Eiji of his own to help him through it. For this reason, even when Yut-Lung is at his most immature, fans are still rooting for him to find happiness and healing.

 4  Ryo Discovered His Humanity Through His Friendship with Akira 
Devilman Crybaby (2018)
        

Ryo&#39;s journey is one of antihero-turned-villain-turned-sympathetic-character. Immediately, viewers are cued into Ryo&#39;s gray morality -- he tricks a demon into merging with his childhood friend Akira, so that Akira&#39;s devilman form can eradicate other demons. Once Ryo is revealed to be Satan, however, he does a 180Â° and attempts to get demons to destroy humanity. Watching Ryo grapple with both sides of himself, and seeing how he is changed for the better through his friendship with Akira, is one of the most fascinating aspects of Devilman Crybaby.

 3  Lelouch&#39;s Motives Are Sympathetic, But He&#39;s Cocky and Ruthless 
Code Geass (2006)
        

There is an equal split between fans of Code Geass on whether Lelouch is an anti-hero or a villain. An exiled prince with a dead mother and a blind sister, it&#39;s easy to understand why Lelouch fights for a better world as the masked revolutionary, Zero. However, he is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, including murder and make others obey him through the power of his Geass. Even so (or perhaps for these very reasons), the hilariously cocky Lelouch is one of the most popular anime characters of all time.

 2  Griffith&#39;s Actions, While Horrific, Stem from His Humanity 
Berserk (1997, 2012, 2016)


 







Berserk&#39;s Griffith is one of the most misunderstood characters in anime and manga history. There is no denying that his actions at the end of the series&#39; Golden Age arc were horrific and forever changed the trajectory of Guts&#39; life. However, his decisions did not stem from being a sociopath. Griffith holds his ambitions above all else, but is unable to reconcile his dream with his humanity. In the end, he cuts off his human side - and all the guilt, empathy, and friendship that comes with it - to become the demonic being, Femto. Griffith is one of the most hated and fascinating anime heroes who became villains, and it&#39;s precisely because he&#39;s so complex.

 1  Light Uses Justice and Altruism as an Excuse for Killing People 
Death Note (2006)


 







Though Light Yagami is one of the smartest shonen anime protagonists, he is also a master of cognitive dissonance. He insists that he uses the Death Note to create a world free of injustice, but viewers will soon realize that his talk of morality is an excuse for mass murder. The more names Light writes in the Death Note, the more he risks being found out, and of course, Light convinces himself that he must kill more people to cover his tracks. Interestingly, his rival, L, is on the side of justice but is also morally gray in his own right.
