## Literature Review

With the overabundance of isekai anime being released in recent years, it was only a matter of time before the genre began experimenting. 




Isekai has become one of the pillars of anime in recent years, with many popular series involving their heroes being transported into strange new settings. While many popular isekai series still present straightforward, unironic stories, others have begun playing around with more self-aware, tongue-in-cheek concepts. Some series are noteworthy for being based on such weird isekai premises.
Thanks in part to the success of series like Sword Art Online, the isekai genre has exploded in popularity since the 2010s. In that time, writers have begun to realize the creative freedom available within the genre, and many of the series that have followed Sword Art Online in the ensuing years have taken the genre in novel directions. Many anime creators have realized that it&#39;s possible to take the isekai genre in some really weird directions.









 








 10  The Hero Becomes a Business Tycoon in a Fantasy World 
The Dungeon of Black Company
        

Kinji doesn&#39;t want to work, and his opening monologue explains how he used an elaborate investment plan to build up enough passive income to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, as soon as he finishes his explanation, he&#39;s sucked into a fantasy world where he finds himself forced to perform backbreaking work. Being both incredibly lazy – albeit possessing excellent financial skills – Kinji&#39;s subsequent quest revolves around taking over the mine company and accumulating enough money to achieve his previous goal of never having to work a day in his life, even in this new world.





 9  Feudal Japan, but Everyone is Female 
Battle Girls - Time Paradox
        

Historical series, especially ones set during Japan&#39;s Sengoku period, aren&#39;t uncommon in anime. Battle Girls manages to do something unique with the concept by making every character depicted on-screen female — except for a dog who serves as the show&#39;s comic relief. Modern middle school student Yoshino Hide gets transported back in time to an all-female alternate version of 16th-century Japan, where she accompanies the warlord Oda Nobunaga, playing more or less the same role as the historical Toyotomi Hideyoshi.





 8  A Fantasy Mech Series Where the Villain is Sir Isaac Newton 
The Vision of Escaflowne
        

In the first episode of The Vision of Escaflowne, high school student Hitomi is transported to the world of Gaea, an eccentric world that blends high fantasy and mechs. It&#39;s quickly established that Hitomi isn&#39;t the first person from Earth to have traveled to Gaea. Several characters remember Hitomi&#39;s grandmother coming to Gaea, and the series&#39; antagonist, Emperor Dornkirk, is heavily implied to be the historical Isaac Newton, something ultimately confirmed by the series&#39; writers. The real-life Newton&#39;s scientific acumen and interest in the occult are taken to their logical extreme in the Zaibach Empire&#39;s technological superiority and Emperor Dornkirk&#39;s ambitions to build a machine to control destiny.





 7  Ancient Chinese Genius Turned Music Producer 
Ya Boy Kongming!
        

The historical Zhuge Liang, also known as Kongming, is one of the most famous figures in China&#39;s Three Kingdom&#39;s era. Known for his superhuman tactical mind and uncanny ability to read and predict the behavior of his enemies, Zhuge Liang adjusts surprisingly well to being reincarnated in modern-day Shibuya. He soon meets an aspiring singer named Eiko, and out of gratitude for her helping him adjust to his new life and landing a bartending job, he agrees to become her manager. He puts his tactical brain to use by helping Eiko launch her musical career. One of the best recent reverse isekai series, Ya Boy Kongming sees Zhuge Liang reinvent many of his famous tactics from Romance of the Three Kingdoms to help Eiko conquer the recording industry.





 6  The Heroine is a Spider 
So I&#39;m a Spider, So What?
        

As far as isekai goes, the most famous series following a protagonist being reborn as a low-level monster is probably That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, but it&#39;s far from the only series to use this idea. So I&#39;m a Spider, So What? sees a high school girl reincarnated as a generic, low-level spider in a high-level dungeon. Unofficially called Kumoko, the heroine is forced into a world where both the human adventurers questing through the dungeon and the other monsters are all trying to kill her. Kumoko is such a unique and memorable isekai protagonist, both because of how quickly she manages to adjust to such a dangerous setting, and because of how dauntlessly plucky she remains as she grows more powerful and goes from generic minion to endgame-level boss character.





 5  The Heroine&#39;s Armor is a Bear Onesie 
Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear
        

Thanks to making a fortune on the stock market, Yuna is able to spend every waking moment playing her favorite virtual reality video game. When given the option to start actually living inside the game, she leaps at the chance. Before entering the game&#39;s world, she is given a high-level suit of armor. Unfortunately for her, that armor takes the form of an adorable bear onesie and matching gloves that look like hand puppets. The most common running joke in the series comes for the incongruous mismatch between Yuna&#39;s overpowered stats and awesome fighting ability, and the cuddly appearance of her armor.





 4  The Hero and His Mom End Up in a Video Game 
Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?
        

For reasons that are never quite made clear, the government has created a virtual reality game designed to improve the relationships between mothers and their children. When Masato is transported into this game world, his mother Mamako naturally comes with him, much to Masato&#39;s horror. In addition to countless puns and wordplay based on the Japanese words for &#34;mother&#34; and &#34;mom&#34;, the bulk of the series&#39; humor comes from having one of the most relatable premises of all time. Mamako is deliberately written as a stereotypical uncool, overprotective mother, and the audience will be able to share Masato&#39;s bewilderment at having his chance for an epic fantasy adventure disrupted by the presence of his overbearing mother. The series is a clever parody of both fantasy RPGs and the isekai genre, with Mamako standing out as a brilliant parody version of an overpowered isekai protagonist.





 3  A Fantasy Villain Forced to Work as a Waitress 
The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!
        

In the Dark Realm, Jahy was the Dark Lord&#39;s second-in-command. After the Dark Realm&#39;s destruction, Jahy was reduced to working as a waitress, living in a crummy apartment, and living paycheck to paycheck. Transporting a stereotypical fantasy-genre villain in such a mundane setting is a brilliant reverse isekai premise. The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated! is also notable for being an entirely female-led series. Other than anonymous background characters, the only male character is the narrator. While he doesn&#39;t have a direct impact on the plot, his deadpan storytelling adds a lot of humor to the series. Much of the series&#39; most heartwarming moments come from Jahy being helped by her female friends like her Boss and the Landlady. Thanks to the support of the other women in her life, things facing Jahy are never quite as bad as they seem, and her friendships are a major factor in her Fantasy villain personality gradually softening.





 2  The First Animated Mario Adaptation Was an Isekai 
The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!
        

The 2023 Mario Bros. movie broke records at the box office, becoming one of the most successful animated movies and video game adaptations of all time. The 2023 movie is not the first time Mario has starred in an isekai. While the series has gone back and forth about whether Mario and Luigi are from the Mushroom Kingdom or from Earth, the first full-length Mario adaptation was an isekai, predating the 2023 movie by almost 40 years. In 1986&#39;s The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!, Mario and Luigi are transported inside their Nintendo Entertainment System and find themselves facing an epic quest to rescue Peach from being forced to marry Bowser. A lot of the specific character and plot details are jarring compared to what would ultimately be codified later on in the series, but there&#39;s a shocking amount of consistency with both later games in the series and especially the 2023 movie.





 1  The Hero is a Vending Machine 
Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon
        

A vending machine is likely the single weirdest thing an isekai protagonist has ever been reincarnated as, especially in the context of a typical high fantasy world. Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon leans into that premise to create a fantastic comedy isekai. An unnamed vending machine aficionado meets an untimely end and is reincarnated in a Fantasy world as a vending machine that comes to be known as Boxxo. For a series with such an inherently ridiculous premise, Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon is actually surprisingly intelligent in examining how life as a sentient, albeit immobile and non-verbal vending machine would actually work, and how the characters living in a fantasy RPG world would adjust to a piece of modern-day technology and make use of a vending machine in their adventures.
The explosion in popularity of the isekai genre has lead to an increasing number of creators choosing to play around with the concept. Although there are still many isekai that play the genre unironically and present straightforward adventures in other worlds, a growing number of creators are choosing to write deliberately ridiculous stories to parody the genre. This has led to some of the weirdest Isekai premises of all time.
