## Literature Review

The Kingdom anime adapts one of the best-selling manga ever, and the new trailer for season 5 proves that more fans should be paying attention to it.




Yasuhisa Hara&#39;s historical warfare manga Kingdom is one of the best-selling and most popular manga of all time, and it obviously received an anime adaptation. The new trailer for season 5 hypes up the exciting anime ahead of its January release.




The official website of the Kingdom anime has revealed its main trailer alongside the main cast and staff of the season.


 

Kingdom season 5 is set to arrive on January 6, 2024, and will be available to stream on Crunchyroll. Adapting an exciting and highly awaited arc, Kingdom is one of the most anticipated anime of winter 2024. With a great storyline and talented staff taking on the project, the fifth installation will definitely be one to look out for.


 Shins Ascends To Glory In Kingdom&#39;s New Season 
          

Season 5 will adapt the Battle of Koku You Hills arc, one of Shin&#39;s hardest and longest wars ever. The trailer introduces the leaders of the opposing army, Ke Isha, Riboku&#39;s most trusted general, and Ki Sui, a man with incredible wit and a heartbreaking past. Kanki, Qin&#39;s most cruel and evil general, is deployed to secure Koko You Hills, a strategic location that is important for Ei Sei&#39;s dream of reuniting China. The battle will last for five entire days and will feature the most evil acts of war yet, thanks to Kanki&#39;s brutality. On the flip side, this battle will be huge for Shin as he achieves a monumental feat that helps him ascend higher to his dreams of becoming a general.




Taking the helm of the season is one of the most legendary anime studios ever, Studio Pierrot, the makers of Naruto, Bleach, Black Clover, Great Teacher Onizuka, and many more. The director will be Kenichi Imaizumi, a veteran with a long resume who has worked on Hunter X Hunter, Sword Art Online, and other great series. Noburo Takagi will be in charge of the series composition while Hiroyuki Sawano, the mastermind behind Attack On Titan&#39;s and anime&#39;s most iconic soundtracks, will be the composer. The opening song will be performed by DeNeel and the ending by Novel Core.



Season 5 will most likely have 23–25 episodes based on previous seasons and the length of the arc that it will adapt.




The first two seasons of Kingdom were brought down by an excess CGI and 3-D animation, causing the series to not be as popular as it deserves to be. Fortunately, the beautiful animation that Studio Pierrot is known for has made the following seasons stand out, and season 5 will not be an exception based on the trailer. Kingdom is easily one of the best history manga out there, and its anime counterpart deserves more attention. The upcoming season 5 will undoubtedly revitalize the series with new fans as it prepares to be one of the highlights for the anime community in 2024.




Kingdom season 5 will be available on Crunchyroll.
