## Literature Review

The Pokémon anime generally shies away from showing the seedier side of its world, but one episode revealed a winner-take-all underground fight scene.




The Pokémon anime isn&#39;t known for dealing with dark topics, but one episode of Pokémon XY provided a glimpse into the seedy world of underground Pokémon fights. These weren&#39;t ordinary Pokémon battles, but high-stakes matches with few rules, complete with the winner taking ownership of the loser&#39;s Pokémon.




In &#34;Rotom&#39;s Wish!&#34;, Ash and his friends find their way into a mostly abandoned hotel. Inside, they discover a Pokémon battle taking place, but it soon comes to an end, and the winner declares his intention to take the loser&#39;s Pangoro, which had been his Pokémon partner for decades. Ash of course steps in, finding this to be preposterous, but it turns out there&#39;s an entire ring of underground battling going on here that&#39;s winner-take-all, and the guy who runs the place, Mantle, happens to be the latest victor.

          

Having witnessed this injustice, Ash and his friends are taken away back in time by a Rotom, who shows how the hotel fell into this situation to begin with, giving them a chance to change it.


 Underground Pokémon Battles Are Hardcore 
          




The battle is shown taking place on a battlefield inside the hotel, where prying eyes can&#39;t find it easily. The area is covered in graffiti, and Mantle has many goons hanging around to help him enforce the &#34;winner takes all&#34; rule. It seems to be a popular hangout for ne&#39;er-do-wells, who are also seen watching the battles and snickering at the Pangoro trainer&#39;s loss, and the operation has been around for at least 10 years. It&#39;s revealed in the past that Ash travels to that Mantle had a battle with the owner&#39;s Rotom, competing for ownership of the hotel, and that Rotom fled, causing him to lose by default and making it clear how the hotel became a site for underground battling in the first place.

The scene is in many ways similar to a scene at an underground fighting ring in the Detective Pikachu movie, although the movie was released long after this episode was, and went a little harder at depicting how dangerous such a place would be. Ash and friends are eventually able to help Rotom defeat the Krookodile by utilizing its various forms, which ultimately changes the future and makes it so that Mantle is an employee at the hotel, rather than running it. The hotel is no longer a site for such underground battles in the new future, and Mantle is shown to have learned his lesson, now a grateful employee at the hotel.






 Pokémon Gave Fans A Glimpse Of The Dark Side Of Its Battle-Based World 
          

While the episode doesn&#39;t provide a very detailed look at the Pokémon underworld, it does prove that such a thing exists, and that people can and do bet big on Pokémon battles. It&#39;s not clear how illegal such underground fights might be; the battle itself wasn&#39;t particularly more vicious than the average Pokémon battle, but gambling on Pokémon matches may well be as frowned upon as betting on animal fights in real life is.

The episode is interesting for showcasing a different side of the Pokémon world than fans usually get to see, and certainly leaves them wondering just what other, darker activities might be going on in that usually cheerful world.
