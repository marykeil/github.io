## Literature Review

Spy X Family Code: White got its first official trailer, giving fans of the spy comedy series an up-close look at what to expect in December.




The first official trailer dropped for Spy X Family Code: White, the upcoming movie set in the world of Tatsuya Endo&#39;s smash hit manga. The footage gives a good idea of the movie&#39;s premise and what to expect in terms of action, spectacle, and comedy. There&#39;s much anticipation for it ahead of its December 22 release - not only are Wit Studio and CloverWorks once again handling the animation, but the story has been penned by Endo as well.




In light of both the manga and the anime&#39;s popularity, it&#39;s no surprise that Spy X Family would also get an original movie as well. The new trailer reveals the cold-weather locales that seem perfectly timed for its winter release.


 

Endo&#39;s contributions to the story are also a promise that Code: White will have strong ties with the main story, and that the characters and writing are as in line with the original story as can be.

                  10 Best Anime Fans of Spy x Family Need to Watch   Spy x Family has ignited an interest in spy-based anime. Fortunately, there are many great series, each with their own take on this winning formula.

The trailer, which has been uploaded to the TOHO animation YouTube channel, provides a picture of what the movie will be about, even without any English subtitles. Despite the Forger family&#39;s attempts to have time off at a wintry vacation area, it seems Anya gets into trouble when she accidentally swallows a chocolate containing something vital to the movie&#39;s new villains, who have been described as an &#34;intelligence agency that is trying to disrupt the East-West peace&#34;. Besides the Forgers, audiences can expect to see Anya&#39;s friends from Eden Academy, Loid&#39;s comrades at WISE, and Yor throwing down with foes.

Every step seems to have been taken to ensure fans that Code: White, despite being an original story, is only a step removed from the anime, which has been faithful to Endo&#39;s manga thus far. The trailer even reveals how the movie has a theme song by the band Official HiGE DANdism, who did the first opening for the anime&#39;s first season. Endo penning the plot also ensures that all the characters, including fan-favorite Anya, remain true to their personalities, though fans shouldn&#39;t try too hard to fit the film into the manga and anime&#39;s overarching canon, as it is just a side story.




          

It&#39;s exciting to see more action-packed scenes from Spy X Family, especially from Yor. The anime is currently adapting the popular Cruise Ship arc, where the assassin gets to take center stage again, which has been a rarity even in the manga itself. Given what the trailer shows, it seems the movie will find a way to give all the characters equal screen time and relevance. With any luck, the franchise&#39;s continuing popularity may grace us with further original movies after the anime catches up with the manga&#39;s storyline. Spy X Family Code: White arrives on December 22 in Japan.
