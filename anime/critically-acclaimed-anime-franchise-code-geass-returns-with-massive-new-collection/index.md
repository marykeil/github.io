## Literature Review

The 2000s-era hit series Code Geass is getting the ultimate new release in a collector&#39;s edition that&#39;s chock full of unique collectibles.




The critically acclaimed hit series from the 2000s, Code Geass, is back with an all-new collector&#39;s edition, comprising the biggest collection of the franchise&#39;s works yet, along with all sorts of cool collectibles. The Blu-ray box set announced by Crunchyroll includes both seasons of the anime series, as well as movies and OVAs.




Code Geass was a 2006 anime series that made major waves with its anti-hero protagonist, Lelouch Vi Britannia, who used a special power called Geass to control the actions of other people. Lelouch is a brilliant tactician, and plots to change the world via revolution by taking up the secret identity of Zero, a masked figure with great sway over the rebellion. The series was known for its twists and turns, and Lelouch became a very popular character at the time as a result, frequently the subject of cosplays and fan art. With the new Blu-ray box set release, fans will be able to relive all of Code Geass&#39;s excitement.

The new Blu-ray box set is currently set for a December 5th release, with pre-orders now available exclusively through Crunchyroll. The set includes both seasons of the anime series, as well as the 5-episode &#34;Akito the Exiled&#34; OVA series, and four Code Geass movies directed by Goro Taniguchi. While the video content itself is more than enough to be worth getting, the set also includes some goodies, such as a Code Geass-themed chess set and board, a pendant necklace depicting the Geass symbol, a USB drive resembling the key to the mecha Lancelot, and a six-month membership to Crunchyroll for new subscribers.




The discs also feature all manner of special features, including commentary tracks, clean versions of opening and ending themes, interviews with the English dub&#39;s voice actors such as Johnny Yong Bosch, and even picture dramas. Some of this content, such as the OVAs, have been difficult to acquire in the past, so their inclusion in this massive box set is more than welcome. The box set is said to be a limited run, so fans who are considering purchasing it would be best off pre-ordering as soon as they can.

Code Geass has been the subject of renewed interest since a new project in the franchise was announced in 2020, supposedly as part of a 10-year plan. While this new series has yet to debut, news of it has prompted some to check out the series for the first time. The series has aged relatively well, still retaining the positive critical impressions it was known for upon its original release. Diehard fans who&#39;ve been waiting for more can certainly tide themselves over with this Code Geass box set.
