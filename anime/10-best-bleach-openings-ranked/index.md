Among the 17 openings fans have been given thus far, a handful standout as Bleach&#39;s best openings.

Bleach Opening 12


Immediately catching the fan&#39;s attention with the title name, chAngE by Miwa from beginning to end is exhilarating and magnificently choreographed.

 9  SCANDAL - Shojo 
Bleach Opening 10


From the attitude of the vocalist and groovy instrumentals to the lyrics explaining someone being fed up with the lies and denial of emotions from someone else, Shojo by SCANDAL should be a sin for how fun it is.

Bleach Opening 13


Bleach&#39;s 13th opening is simply perfect down to the smallest detail.
