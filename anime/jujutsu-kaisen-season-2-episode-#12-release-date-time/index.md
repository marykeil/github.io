## Literature Review

After an explosive episode #11 that saw the return of a major villain, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #12 will likely feature even more epic fights.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode #12 Releases 
          




Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #12 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, October 12. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 12 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #11? 
          

In episode #11, Yuji, Megumi, and Ino tried to break through one of the veils surrounding the Shibuya Station. They quickly realized, given the strength of the barrier, that the one powering it was outside of it. Finding the sorcerers responsible, they initiated a fight, with Yuji and Megumi battling the disturbing Awasaka and Ino taking on Ogami and her grandson. While Awasaka initially gave Yuji and Megumi trouble due to his Inversion technique, they quickly figured it out and were able to defeat him. Ino however suffered a brutal loss as Ogami was able to imbue her grandson with the powers of Toji Fushiguro, the man who beat Gojo in the previous arc.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #12 Will Feature Even More Fights 
          

Now that Awasaka and Ino are both defeated it would be only natural for Yuji and Megumi to face off against Ogami and her Tojified grandson. This could potentially be a very dramatic confrontation for Megumi as he will be facing someone who is the spitting image of his father. In addition, as shown in the brutal Gojo&#39;s Past arc, Toji&#39;s incredibly strong abilities make him a force to be reckoned with, so Yuji and Megumi won&#39;t be able to defeat him as easily as they did Awasaka. The episode could also focus on some of the other sorcerers and curses who are running around Shibuya as well.

Many fan-favorite sorcerers like Nanami, Nobara, and Maki haven&#39;t yet had a chance to shine in this arc despite having entered the veils surrounding Shibuya. Episode #12 could also feature fights involving them potentially facing off against the Disaster Curses like Mahito, Jogo, and Choso. Given the high standard that the previous fights in this arc have maintained, if Jujutsu Kaisen continues this trend then Season 2 episode #12 will be another great installment in the series.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #12 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 12, 2023.
