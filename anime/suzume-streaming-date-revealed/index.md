## Literature Review

Crunchyroll has just announced the official streaming date for the hit 2023 film Suzume, and it&#39;s closer than fans expected!




The official streaming date for the hit 2023 film Suzume has officially been revealed. Suzume, the latest film from Your Name director Makoto Shinkai, has been a hot topic throughout the year. Not only did it deliver another solid film to his filmography, but it also joined the ranks of greats like Spirited Away and Weathering With You as one of the highest-grossing anime films of all time. Now, fans will be able to stream this landmark 2023, and they wont have to wait too long.




According to Crunchyroll, Suzume will begin streaming exclusively on their site starting November 16, 2023. However, there will be some restrictions. For starters, the film will only begin streaming on the site at 5:00 PM Pacific Time, so it will not be immediately made available in certain regions. Also, the film will have some geographic restrictions on where viewers can stream it. As of right now, &#34;North America, Central America, South America, Europe (excluding France), Africa, Oceania, the Middle East and CIS&#34; will get the film as scheduled.


 

It&#39;s currently unclear if France and countries in Asia will be able to stream Suzume on Crunchyroll in the future. If not, the film will likely find its way to separate streaming services in these countries under differing contracts.





 What is Suzume? 


          

The hit Makoto Shinkai story follows a young woman named Suzume as she goes on the journey of a lifetime. Crunchyroll describes the film as &#34;a coming-of-age story&#34; that&#39;s &#34;set in various disaster-stricken locations across Japan, where she [Suzume] must close the doors causing devastation.&#34; What sets this film apart from most of Shinkai&#39;s films though is that it fully embraces fantasy.

Shinkai&#39;s previous films, Your Name and Weathering With You, used touches of fantasy to tell their story as they stayed grounded in reality for the most part with a hint of the supernatural to explain the phenomena of body-switching and controlling the weather. However, Suzume leans hard into fantasy with moving chairs and mysterious doorways that make it feel right at home among some of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s Studio Ghibli films. It&#39;s a departure from what Shinkai has done in the past, and yet it&#39;s this change-up that won many critics over.






 Critics Agree Suzume is a Can&#39;t-Miss Movie Experience 
          

As of November 13, 2023, Suzume has an impressive score among critics and audiences on Rotten Tomatoes with 96% giving the film a favorable review. The film has been described as &#34;visually thrilling and emotionally impactful&#34; in its official consensus, even if it falls &#34;just a bit short of the bar set by previous outings.&#34; Even ScreenRant&#39;s very own Joshua Fox praised the film, describing it as a fantastic story that has serious heart. This positive word-of-mouth has spread so far that it&#39;s made Suzume a highly sought-after film by anime fans. Now, anyone who missed out on seeing it in theaters will be able to see it for themselves when it officially debuts on Crunchyroll.

Suzume has made waves among anime and film fans alike for its vibrant animation and impactful story. Now, anyone will be able to see Makoto Shinkai&#39;s latest masterwork very soon. With the official stream date set for November 16 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time, Suzume will likely be talked about among the communities again very soon as fans continue to applaud its successes as one of 2023&#39;s best films.




Look for Suzume when it releases on Crunchyroll on November 16th!
