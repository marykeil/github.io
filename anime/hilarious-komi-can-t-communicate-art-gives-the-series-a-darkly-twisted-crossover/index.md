## Literature Review

A hilarious piece of fan art by Turbulent_Set8884 gave Komi Can&#39;t Communicate the perfect crossover that makes its cute premise darkly twisted.





Artist Turbulent_Set8884 recently shared a piece of fan art on the Komi-San Reddit community page that imagines the end of Komi Can&#39;t Communicate. Komi is addressing her 100 newfound friends with courage in her voice. However, it turns out she&#39;s been harboring a secret. She pulls out her notebook that she&#39;s been using to list each of the friends she&#39;s made with Tadano&#39;s help throughout high school and reveals that the cover is a fake. The truth is she&#39;s been writing everyone&#39;s names in none other than the Death Note in a hilarious turn of events that&#39;s worthy of being on the same level as the series&#39; funniest moments.

What&#39;s hilarious about this sudden crossover with Tsugumi Ohba&#39;s thriller manga Death Note is how it completely turns Komi&#39;s adorable premise on its head. The story has been built up for many chapters and episodes as a serious effort by Komi to make friends after being shy for years. The plot twist that she&#39;s been planning the demise of her classmates this entire time shows that she&#39;s as clever as Light Yagami in hiding her emotions and true intentions.

This fan art shows an alternate reality where Komi likely saw her classmates as nuisances that she wanted to be rid of since they all obsess over her, so she hatched a plot and used Tadano to get rid of them once and for all. It&#39;s a clever twist on what Komi Can&#39;t Communicate is all about and is incredibly funny to boot seeing how stern Komi&#39;s face is when she reveals the Death Note to the crowd.

 How Would Komi&#39;s Friends Die from the Death Note? 
          

Of course, it&#39;s highly doubtful that each of Komi&#39;s &#34;friends&#34; would fall from a simple heart attack as the rule in the book states if a method isn&#39;t given by the writer. Some of the possible causes of death Komi could write could include playing on Najimi&#39;s popularity among others and a fate worse than death for Ren Yamai due to her obsession for Komi&#39;s affection. Each student is shown to have numerous quirks that exaggerate their personalities, so finding ironic ways for them to meet their demise wouldn&#39;t be outside the realm of possibility. The only outliers that Komi could end up sparing are Tadano and Manbagi since they bonded so much with her that they became her romantic interest and best friend respectively.




 : Komi Can&#39;t Communicate: Komi&#39;s Classmates from Worst to BestKomi&#39;s quest for 100 friends will undoubtedly not pull a surprise Death Note by the story&#39;s end since a crossover of that scale would have serious implications for Komi&#39;s true motives. However, it&#39;s a funny glimpse into a What If scenario. Komi Can&#39;t Communicate is a wholesome and sweet series, so Turbulent_Set8884&#39;s Death Note crossover gives it a hilariously twisted spin that should please Komi fans that want a bit of dark humor.
