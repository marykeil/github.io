## Literature Review

Netflix recently announced a remake of the One Piece anime, and the new series has a big chance to fix the main anime&#39;s earliest mistakes.




In a shocking turn, One Piece will receive an anime remake spearheaded by Netflix and Wit Studio. After the extremely successful release of Netflix&#39;s live-action One Piece, it seems the streaming giant can&#39;t get enough of the hit adventure series. What&#39;s most exciting about the remake for longtime fans though is that it has a chance to fix many of the main anime&#39;s early problems.




Announced in this year&#39;s Jump Festa, a promotional video for the remake was made ahead of the anime&#39;s 25 years of release.


 

As reported by Netflix Anime, the series will be recreated, and it will be available exclusively on Netflix. There is no release window yet, but considering the magnitude of this announcement, it will surely come sooner rather than later.

                  One Piece&#39;s Controversial Wano Ending Was Fixed In The Anime   The final moments of One Piece&#39;s most vile villain, Kurozumi Orochi, were met with controversy that the anime adaptation has changed for the better.   


 Wit Studio&#39;s One Piece Can Improve the Original&#39;s Pacing &amp; Animation 

 




The announcement was made at Jump Festa 2024 to end this year&#39;s exciting event filled with explosive news such as the ending of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga or the Chainsaw Man movie. Despite all those great announcements, nobody could&#39;ve predicted that One Piece would receive a remake. The project will be produced by Netflix and animated by Wit Studio, the animation studio behind Attack On Titan and Vinland Saga before MAPPA, as well as the upcoming Suicide Squad: Isekai anime. The staff of the anime has not been revealed yet.

There are few studios as perfect for this remake as Wit Studio, as they can fix the issues that fans have with the main anime. As much of a masterpiece One Piece is, it is not immune to criticism. From the lackluster animation in the first few hundred episodes due to technological constraints to the horrible pacing that still lingers, Wit Studio remaking the series is a match made in heaven. The studio is known for its gorgeous visuals and faithfulness to what they&#39;re adapting, with no fillers or pacing issues, things that the main anime has suffered from. This will bring in interested fans who were turned away due to these issues.






 2023 Was a Great Year For One Piece, But 2024 Could Be Better 
          

                  Shonen Jump&#39;s Heirs To One Piece Fail To Meet Expectations   Three manga that were made to replace One Piece and Shonen Jump&#39;s biggest manga are performing poorly popularity-wise reveals a new poll.   

One Piece fans are definitely the happiest, with the Egghead Arc coming on January 7, the prequel series Monsters receiving an anime coming to Netflix in January, and the manga heading to its next exciting arc very soon. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem like the remake will be coming anytime soon, as Wit Studio has announced that it is hiring animators to start working on the show, meaning that the project is still in the beginning stages. There is still a lot to be excited about, as fans who want to rewatch One Piece can experience the iconic show in all its glory.
