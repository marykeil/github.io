## Literature Review

After years of anticipation, A new Dragon Ball anime, Dragon Ball: Daima, was announced at this year&#39;s New York Comic Con.




A new Dragon Ball anime titled Dragon Ball Daima was announced at this year&#39;s New York Comic-Con. After years of waiting for a new Dragon Ball anime, fans were eagerly anticipating this year&#39;s Dragon Ball panel at New York Comic-Con. Luckily for fans, the panel didn&#39;t disappoint as a new series was indeed announced.




At this year&#39;s New York Comic-Con, the new anime Dragon Ball: Daima was announced with a 2024 release window. According to the trailer put out by Toei Animation, the series will follow Goku and his friends after they&#39;re de-aged. Daima&#39;s trailer showcased scenes of Goku and Vegeta fighting as well as much of the cast being de-aged. Details beyond that are scarce at the moment, but what&#39;s already been shown is exciting for fans of the series as it promises to return the series to its roots. The series will take place sometime before the end of Dragon Ball Z, but it&#39;s unclear where the series fits into the Dragon Ball franchise&#39;s timeline or if it will take GT or Super as canon.


 Dragon Ball: Daima Releases in 2024 

 

Though fans might have been hoping for a follow-up to the Dragon Ball Super anime, there are more than a few reasons to be excited for the release of Daima. The obvious comparison point to many fans will be Dragon Ball GT, which also featured Goku being aged down. What sets Daima apart though is that it will feature younger versions of the entire franchise&#39;s cast as opposed to just Goku. This will no doubt be interesting as it remains to be seen how characters like Vegeta and Bulma will handle their new age.






 What Does Dragon Ball: Daima Mean for Dragon Ball Super? 
          

 While fans have more than a few reasons to be excited for Daima, it naturally begs the question of what its announcement means for the return of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s anime. Dragon Ball Super&#39;s anime officially ended back in 2018 with the conclusion of the Tournament of Power Arc. The series has also technically continued with the release of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, but that&#39;s an entirely different beast from the new Dragon Ball Super anime series fans have hoped for. There are still two meaty manga arcs for the series to adapt, so it seems strange that Super hasn&#39;t returned.

Luckily, Daima shouldn&#39;t be taken as a sign that Super is never returning. One thing the trailer for Daima emphasized was that the series is meant to celebrate Dragon Ball&#39;s 40th anniversary. Given this, it would make sense that Daima is Dragon Ball&#39;s big 2024 release, while a hypothetical return for Super could be looking more at a 2025 release. This would not only give Toei animation more time to get Super&#39;s return right after a poor reception to the first anime&#39;s early days, but also give the manga more room to breathe for a new arc, possibly focusing on the lingering threat of Black Frieza.




                  How Old is the Cast of Dragon Ball in Super?   It&#39;s hard to track the age of the Dragon Ball cast, so fans may be wondering how exactly old Goku and friends are at the time of Dragon Ball Super.   

Regardless of what Daima means for Dragon Ball Super though, it&#39;s undeniably an exciting announcement. With the trailer displaying impressive animation and a return of young Goku, the anime is set to celebrate Dragon Ball&#39;s 40th anniversary in a huge way. Dragon Ball Daima is already shaping up to be a worthy embodiment of the franchise&#39;s enduring legacy.
