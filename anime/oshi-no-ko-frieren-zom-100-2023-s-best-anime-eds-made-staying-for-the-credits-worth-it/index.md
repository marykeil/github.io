## Literature Review

While anime EDs aren&#39;t typically as iconic as the much flashier openings, 2023 released some incredibly cool endings that go against this trend.




While they often aren&#39;t as eye-catching as anime openings, EDs can still be incredibly impactful, as many of 2023&#39;s best anime EDs show. These EDs often serve as a great place for fans to decompress after the events of the episode or build hype for the next one. To do this, these EDs blend music and animation in a masterful way.
A good ED can be classified as such based on a variety of criteria. The animation and the song themselves are of course the main elements to judge, and a superb example of one can often make up for deficiencies in the other. Beyond these individual elements, how well the two synchronize can also be a major component of how effective an ED is. The last major criterion is how well the ending actually fits the show it is for, as an out-of-place ED can often disorient the viewer. Based on these factors, here are the ten best EDs of 2023.









 








 10  Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War 
Produced by Studio Pierrot based on the manga by Tite Kubo


  Song   Artist    Endroll   Yoh Kamiyama    
Bleach&#39;s latest ED isn&#39;t the most interesting of the long-running and iconic series but it is still very good. Symbolically showing off the series’ main villains the Quincy in a series of striking images that flow together beautifully. Unfortunately, it lacks the dynamism of many other EDs that came out in 2023, instead feeling like it is scrolling over a large painting. However, that doesn&#39;t diminish the ending&#39;s grandeur or take away from how awesome its accompanying song is.

 9  Trigun Stampede 
Produced by Studio Orange based on the manga by Yasuhiro Nightow


  Song   Artist    Hoshi no Kuzu α   Salyu and Haruka Nakamura    
Many EDs choose to show off their characters in different ways, but Trigun Stampede&#39;s ending instead focuses on the anime&#39;s setting. In a dazzling display of animation, the stars dance across the screen, forming constellations that shift and break apart. For a science fiction series like Trigun, it may seem a bit fantastical, but the emotional effect it produces is incredibly powerful and does a great job of showing the beauty of space. The song itself is also good, serving as a tonal shift from the action featured in the anime&#39;s plot.

 8  Vinland Saga 
Produced by Studio MAPPA based on the manga by Makoto Yukimura


  Song   Artist    Without Love   LMYK    
Vinland Saga is one of the most emotionally complex anime of 2023, so it makes sense that its ED would follow suit. The ED shows Thorfinn grappling with his trauma and depression as a harrowing song plays over his suffering. Despite this, the ED still manages to be hopeful, showing that Thorfinn can find a healthy way to confront his past if he opens up to others like Einar and engages in meaningful work. The ED also has some nice subtleties, such as the song&#39;s use of English lyrics potentially being a reflection of the Western setting. The ED proves why Vinland Saga is a modern anime classic.
Vinland Saga&#39;s other ED in 2023 was also incredibly good.

 7  Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead 
Produced by Bug Films based on the manga by Haro Aso and Kotaro Takata


  Song   Artist    Happiness of the Dead   Shiyui    
Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead is a show about enjoying life even as the world falls apart and its ED encapsulates this feeling perfectly. The ED features some cool symbolic shots like a mugshot with characters spelling out the English word “death”, but the heart of it is the images of Akira and his new friends hanging out together and having fun. Accompanied by an energetic song by Shiyui, it’s impossible not to smile along with the characters as they enjoy each other’s company. This contagious energy is a big part of what makes Zom 100 a modern anime classic.

 6  Heavenly Delusion 
Produced by Production I.G based on the manga by Masakazu Ishiguro


  Song   Artist    Daremo Karemo Dokomo Nanimo Shiranai   ASOBI Doumei    
Just like with Zom 100, the ED of Heavenly Delusion shows its wide cast of characters hanging out together and having fun. What makes this especially poignant however is that Heavenly Delusion is generally a much darker show than Zom 100, with large parts of it taking place in a bleak, post-apocalyptic world. This makes seeing the characters share moments of happiness even more enjoyable. The ED also has a beautiful and trippy animation sequence near its end that is glorious to behold. This is yet more proof that Heavenly Delusion is one of anime’s best hidden gems from 2023.

 5  Konosuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World 
Produced by Drive based on the light novels by Natsume Akatsuki


  Song   Artist    Jump In   Takahashi and Aki Toyosaki    
The EDs for the main entries in the Konosuba series have been deceptively tranquil glimpses into the lives of Kazuma’s party, which are entertaining in a calming way. Given the spinoff anime Konosuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World’s focus on the bombastic Megumin, it only makes sense that the ED for that show would break from this pattern. In its ED, Megumin and her friend/rival Yunyun are energetically imagined in the style of childish doodles, which adorably capture their personalities. This ED is a testament to how a unique art style can elevate a relatively simple sequence into something truly special.

 4  Jujutsu Kaisen 
Produced by Studio MAPPA based on the manga by Gege Akutami


  Song   Artist    more than words   Hitsujibungaku    
Given the brutal nature of the Shibuya Incident arc, it wouldn’t have been strange if Jujutsu Kaisen’s latest ED was a dark and gritty display of violence. Surprisingly though, the ED for the Shibuya Incident is laid back and emotionally tender, showing Yuji and his friends having fun hanging out together. This might have seemed jarring to some fans at first, but it has proven a welcome counterpoint to the brutal cliffhangers that many recent episodes have ended on, giving viewers time to decompress. While much of this ED&#39;s greatness may come down to this emotional context, it is still easily one of the best EDs of 2023.
Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s other ED in 2023 was used for a similar purpose in the Gojo&#39;s Past arc.

 3  Oshi no Ko 
Produced by Doga Kobo based on the manga by Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari


  Song   Artist    Mephisto   QUEEN BEE    
A show about the music industry should naturally have a great ED and Oshi no Ko easily lives up to this expectation. Its visuals are great, showing off Aqua and Ruby&#39;s differing reactions to their mother&#39;s death, with Ruby moving upwards to achieve the dreams she never could in her previous life and Aqua descending into the darkness of his revenge. Where the ED really shines however is its beautiful song by QUEEN BEE, which somehow manages to match and sometimes surpass Oshi no Ko&#39;s incredibly popular opening song by Yoasobi. This musical tour de force makes this ED one of the best of 2023.

 2  Spy x Family 
Produced by Wit Studio and CloverWorks based on the manga by Tatsuya Endo


  Song   Artist    Todome no Ichigeki   Vaundy and Cory Wong    
Spy x Family has a long history of great EDs, often capturing the lighthearted and wholesome nature of the show. Its latest ED is no exception, this time being a visually stunning reimagining of some of Anya&#39;s drawings. Being based on a child&#39;s creativity, the ending itself is also quite innovative, flashing through different elements of the Forger family&#39;s lives and showing Anya doing things like grabbing onto a musical note or flying through the air. The ending is also animated in a fun paper cutout style that perfectly matches the fun tone of the song and Anya&#39;s whimsical fantasies.
The ED greatly improves upon Anya&#39;s typically more abstract artistic style.

 1  Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End 
Produced by Madhouse based on the manga by Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe


  Song   Artist    Anytime Anywhere   milet    
It is a blessing for fans that Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End actually does have an ending, as its ED is easily the best of the year. Animated in a painted style, the ending transitions from various characters in clever ways that highlight the passage of time, a core theme of the show. In addition, the accompanying song by milet is one of the best of the year, and its emotional chords allow viewers to decompress from whatever happened in the preceding episode. All of these elements combine to give Frieren a masterful ending theme that is easily the best anime ED of 2023.
