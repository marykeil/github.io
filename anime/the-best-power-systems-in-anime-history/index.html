  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Many anime shows feature fantastical power sets. Some excel for their simplicity and versatility, while others are set apart by their complexity.</p>
<p>Like any fictional story with supernatural powers, anime is no stranger to power systems. Whether it&rsquo;s hard magic or soft magic, anime will almost always have a specific method of explaining how everyone&rsquo;s abilities work, and no two types of anime will ever have the same type of power at play.
Power systems are incredibly common in anime, and some, naturally, stand out as being better than others. How detailed a power system ends up being often plays a big part in its quality, but more than that, whether or not an anime&rsquo;s power system allows for characters to fight in unique and creative ways is often the biggest deciding factor in the quality of said power system.</p>
<p>Some anime uphold that idea far better than others, and the ones that do always stand out as some of the best in all of anime.</p>
<p>10 Magi: The Labyrinth Of Magic&rsquo;s Rukh Is One Of Anime&rsquo;s Most Intricate Magic Systems
Anime series by A-1 Pictures; Based on the manga by Shinobu Ohtaka</p>
<p>In the world of Magi, all life draws power from, and eventually returns to, the flow of energy called the Rukh. Rukh, in turn, generates Magoi, Magi&rsquo;s form of magic power, and magicians and other characters use this to fuel their magical abilities. What makes Rukh such a great power system is the complexity of its uses. When someone becomes a master of Rukh, Rukh and Magoi can be used for not only incredibly powerful elemental magic, but magical abilities that can manipulate space and reality, as well.
Rukh is also used for the magical abilities of the melee weapons called Metal Vessels, so it&rsquo;s not something that can only be used by the magically inclined. That level of versatility, combined with its power, gives Magi a power system that&rsquo;s easily one of the most intricate and all-around great in all of anime.</p>

<p>9 Dragon Ball&rsquo;s Ki Is Incredible In Its Simplicity
Anime series by Toei Animation; Based on the manga by Akira Toriyama</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, a power system that&rsquo;s great for its simplicity is Dragon Ball&rsquo;s ki. Ki is the power that all living beings draw on in Dragon Ball, likely taken from the Chinese concept of qi or ch&rsquo;i. By utilizing ki, a person gains access to a variety of abilities such as flight, super strength, and, most notably, firing powerful energy beams.
Ki is hardly a complex power system, but that&rsquo;s part of what makes it so great. Leaving ki as simply a form of energy a person can harness and improve upon through training means that no one has to think too hard about how it works, and because of that, Dragon Ball characters can continually engage in epic, Earth-shattering battles without ever needing to try too hard to justify things. Dragon Ball has always thrived on the relative simplicity of its writing, and the simplicity of ki plays a big part in that.

<p>Dragon Ball<br>
From the creative mind of Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is a mega multimedia franchise that spans back to the 1980s. Dragon Ball expanded quickly, starting as a serialized manga for Weekly Shonen Jump in Japan. It made its way overseas via manga and an anime adaptation that is enjoyed worldwide. Dragon Ball was the initial starting animated series that followed the adventures of the young Son Goku as he sought after the Dragon Balls. These mystical orbs would grant the wish of any who gathered them together. Then, the series would branch off into the immensely popular Dragon Ball Z, which followed Goku as an adult and featured high-intensity battles and Goku&rsquo;s never-ending search to be the strongest. The series has also enjoyed several popular video game adaptations and continues to release several new animated series and theatrical films up to the recent popular Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.</p>

<p>8 Gurren Lagann&rsquo;s Spiral Power Is Anime&rsquo;s Greatest Weaponization Of Willpower
Anime series by Studio Trigger</p>
<p>Another anime power system that thrives on its simplicity is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann&rsquo;s Spiral Power. In the world of Gurren Lagann, all beings capable of evolution and reproduction, most notably humans, can channel their willpower into a physical form called Spiral Power. Spiral Power has a lot of uses, but its most notable one is being used as a power source for Gunmen, the signature mechs of the anime.
Much like ki in Dragon Ball, there isn&rsquo;t much to think about with Spiral Power, but that&rsquo;s what makes it such a great power system. Spiral Power is simply a means of taking incredible willpower to its most extreme form, and that ends up being used to tremendous effect when the cast uses Spiral Power to literally make the impossible possible, even going so far as using Spiral Power to create Gunmen larger than the entire universe several times over. It&rsquo;s a blatantly ridiculous power system, but there&rsquo;s no power system better for such a ridiculous anime like Gurren Lagann.</p>

<p>7 Fullmetal Alchemist&rsquo;s Alchemy Is A Brilliant Mixture Of Science &amp; Fantasy
Anime series by Studio Bones; Based on the manga by Hiromu Arakawa</p>
<p>For an anime power system that borrows from Western ideas, a great one to discuss is alchemy from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Alchemy is a real-life theoretical practice, but in the world of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, alchemy is all too real. The power allows alchemists to manipulate matter however they see fit while following the concept of equivalent exchange, although that can be circumvented with the power of the legendary Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone.
While alchemy isn&rsquo;t that complex a power on a surface level, there&rsquo;s a surprising amount of depth to it. With how much of the series is rooted in science, the series always makes a point of how the alchemists need to understand everything they do on a chemical level, so even when Fullmetal Alchemist fights devolve into flashy and bombastic set pieces, it&rsquo;s still understood that there&rsquo;s a logical and scientific cause and effect to everything. It&rsquo;s rare for an anime to structure a power system like that, and that&rsquo;s a big part of what makes alchemy so great.

<p>6 My Hero Academia&rsquo;s Quirks Perfectly Bring Superhero Action Into Anime
Anime series by Studio Bones; Based on the manga by Kohei Horikoshi</p>
<p>Another great anime power system that draws from Western culture is My Hero Academia&rsquo;s Quirks. At some point in human history, humanity spontaneously developed strange, supernatural abilities called Quirks, with the abilities varying from being largely useless to having the potential to cause untold destruction if left unchecked. By the start of the story, nearly everyone in the world has Quirks and the world has changed into one that revolves heavily around them, most notably by making superheroes a part of everyday life as opposed to pure fiction.
Quirks, and My Hero Academia, as a whole, draw heavily from Western superhero comics, and that&rsquo;s a big part of why Quirks are so great. Just like in a superhero story, Quirks allow the characters in My Hero Academia to have a wide variety of physical and abstract abilities, and even as the series approaches its conclusion, it keeps finding new ways to push the boundaries of what Quirks can do. There are very few power systems that allow for such a variety of abilities like Quirks, and that always comes out in the best of ways.

<p>In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &ldquo;One-For-All&rdquo; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.</p>

<p>5 Bleach&rsquo;s Spiritual Power Leads To An Incredibly Varied Assortment Of Powers
Anime series by Studio Pierrot; Based on the manga by Tite Kubo</p>
<p>Spiritual power is the energy shared by all supernatural beings in Bleach, whether they be Soul Reapers, Quincies, Hollows, or even just spiritually-inclined humans. In its most basic form, spiritual power is used to enhance one&rsquo;s physical abilities and paralyze opponents through spiritual pressure, but most people use it to harness the specific abilities of the race they belong to such as Zanpakuto or Fullbrings.
There are a lot of different things that spiritual power can be used for in Bleach, and that&rsquo;s a big part of what makes it so great. By making spiritual power a universal ability in Bleach, it makes it easy to understand that all powers in Bleach are derived from the same basic source and can affect each other because of that, so no one is ever in a situation where they have an explicit advantage over someone else. It&rsquo;s a power system that&rsquo;s deceptively complex, and that always leads to some incredible fighting and worldbuilding.

<p>Bleach<br>
Bleach is a multimedia franchise created by Tite Kubo. The franchise started as a Japanese manga series. Ichigo Kurosaki is the main protagonist who is granted the powers of a being called the Soul Reaper.

<p>4 Devil Fruits Give One Piece One Of Anime&rsquo;s Most Unique Power Systems Ever
Anime series from Toei Animation; Based on the manga by Eiichiro Oda</p>
<p>One Piece is another anime belonging to the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; of shonen anime, and very appropriately, it boasts a great power system in Devil Fruits. Throughout the world of One Piece, there exist mysterious fruits called Devil Fruits that grant you powerful abilities upon consumption. The most consistent drawback is that eating a Devil Fruit permanently robs someone of their ability to swim, but with how useful some Devil Fruits are, that&rsquo;s often not a problem.
Like other anime power systems, the biggest selling point of Devil Fruits is how unique and versatile they are. It&rsquo;s one thing for there to be such a wide variety of Devil Fruit powers, but One Piece always makes it clear that any Devil Fruit can be useful depending on both the situation and the user&rsquo;s creativity, so there end up being many fights where a seemingly useless power becomes the biggest asset thanks to a specific matchup. That level of creativity makes every fight in One Piece great to watch, and that&rsquo;s remained true even after almost 30 years.

<p>One Piece<br>
Created by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece is a multimedia franchise that began as a manga series and follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates as led by Monkey D. Luffy. Luffy, an enthusiastic pirate with a thirst for adventure, is afflicted by a mysterious curse that gives him various powers he uses to protect himself and his friends. The manga eventually gave way to the anime series, with the two being some of history&rsquo;s longest-running anime and manga series. Along with over fifty video games made over the years, the series entered the live-action world with Netflix&rsquo;s 2023 adaptation.</p>

<p>3 Naruto&rsquo;s Chakra Is A Classic That Stood The Test Of Time
Anime series by Studio Pierrot; Based on the manga by Masashi Kishimoto</p>
<p>Chakra is the energy that all ninja draw on in combat to use their jutsu in Naruto. This comes out in a variety of ways; ninjutsu, for example, is often used for flashy elemental attacks, whereas taijutsu is used for powerful physical attacks that push a person&rsquo;s body to its limit. Just like the power systems of the other &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo;, chakra is a great power system because of its sheer versatility.
Whatever a person is capable of in Naruto depends solely on how much chakra they have and their creativity in using it, and that often leads to the strongest characters in Naruto fighting with jutsu that are massive and can equal the feats of the gods. There&rsquo;s very little that characters in Naruto can&rsquo;t do by harnessing their chakra, and that&rsquo;s helped to make it one of anime&rsquo;s most classic power systems.

<p>2 Cursed Energy Gives Jujutsu Kaisen One Of Modern Anime&rsquo;s Best Power Systems
Anime series by Studio MAPPA; Based on the manga by Gege Akutami</p>
<p>For a power system from a more modern anime, a great one to discuss is cursed energy from Jujutsu Kaisen. As the name would imply, cursed energy is a spiritual force derived from negative energy in the world and an individual, although experienced sorcerers can activate it under any emotion. While most sorcerers simply use cursed energy for different forms of offense and defense, some can use it to active unique abilities called cursed techniques, with each one varying from person to person.
Cursed energy draws heavy inspiration from older anime, but it still ends up having a lot of uniqueness. In addition to how many fights in Jujutsu Kaisen revolve around characters repeatedly trying to outsmart one another as they analyze every possible move their opponent can make, cursed energy even weaponizes the anime trope of randomly explaining your powers by increasing a person&rsquo;s power when they do so, meaning it actually provides a reason for one of the biggest cliches in the medium. All of that comes together to give Jujutsu Kaisen one of the best power systems in modern anime.

Gojo, who also happens to be a faculty member at a high school, enrolls Yuji there to help him and other students prepare themselves against the supernatural forces that plague humanity.</p>

<p>1 Nen Makes Hunter X Hunter One Of Anime&rsquo;s Smartest Stories
Anime series by Madhouse; Based on the manga by Yoshihiro Togashi</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter&rsquo;s Nen is a power system that revolves around weaponizing a person&rsquo;s life force, although the vast majority of people go their entire lives without ever learning of its existence. Nen comes in six different forms that are dependent on a person&rsquo;s personality, although someone can use more than one type of Nen in very unique circumstances.
Hunter x Hunter is famous for its complex writing, and Nen plays a big part in that. While Nen initially seems simple, each one is vague enough to allow for a wide variety of abilities that fall under each specific classification, and even after 25 years, Hunter x Hunter still keeps finding ways to show off how creative Nen can be in application. There are very few anime to utilize their abilities to the same degree as Hunter x Hunter, and as a result, it easily stands out as having one of the best power systems in all of anime.
