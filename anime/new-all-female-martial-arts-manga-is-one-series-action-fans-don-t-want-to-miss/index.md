## Literature Review

Yabako Sandrovich&#39;s Strike It Rich deserves more attention, whether for its female combatants – or its amusing twist villain.





A series that features serious female combatants is often a rarity, as it seems easier to market them solely on their character designs or play their fights for laughs. Strike It Rich, at least, is willing to try something different. Sandrovich renders the fights at Valkyria with the same intense choreography found in his other manga. Better still, the tournament is underpinned by a unique overarching plot revolving around the manga&#39;s villain protagonist, Hina Hongou.

 Strike It Rich Differs From Other Martial Arts Manga 
          

While dainty women doing high kicks in short skirts is the cliché, Strike It Rich chooses to focus on the athleticism of its female fighters. Indeed, the cast of the manga encompasses a wild array of body shapes and martial arts. While the two main leads – tourney organizer and ex-MMA fighter Nozomi, and the deadly Hina – have stereotypically cute designs, Sandrovich clearly doesn&#39;t feel obligated to make everyone a supermodel. It&#39;s a refreshing change of pace: even if there are conventionally attractive characters, their noticeable muscle tone and practical outfits show they don&#39;t have to overpower or undermine the fighting.

Sandrovich&#39;s choice of protagonist is also a clever twist. Unlike Kengan Ashura&#39;s Ohma Tokita – a scrappy nobody who fights his way to the top - Hina Hongou is a physical and mental ace, and a dubiously villainous character. Supposedly the mastermind behind a fallen cult, Hina taunts Nozomi and her friends to find her powerful opponents in exchange for biological weapons she has stolen. While this is all played for absurdity, it still adds a cat-and-mouse subplot, where the goal is not for the hero to win a tournament, but to find a strong enough enemy to defeat the baby-faced villain.




All in all, this new manga shouldn&#39;t be underestimated. Even if the brawny women make it seem no different from Kengan Ashura, Hina&#39;s inversion of the tournament&#39;s stakes ought to be interesting enough to follow, as readers will see whether the unfortunate organizers will succeed in beating the location of the WMDs out of &#34;the deadliest schoolgirl in Japan&#34;. The manga only began serialization this April, and hasn&#39;t gotten very far with its bi-weekly schedule. For fans of martial arts stories who want something new, catching up on ST☆R: Strike it Rich should be of little challenge.
