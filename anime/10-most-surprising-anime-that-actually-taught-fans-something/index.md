## Literature Review

Whether it&#39;s history, science, or economics, thanks to anime, it&#39;s possible to learn some cool things from unexpected anime sources.





Some of the best anime provide an opportunity to learn, while also being entertaining watches in their own right. Educational and informative anime teach the audience new things. Learning new things opens new doors and can introduce the audience to whole new hobbies and fields of study.









 








 10  Therma Romae Novae - Roman Culture 
       Thermae Romae Novae/Netflix.  

Broadly an Isekai story about a time-traveling ancient Roman who moves back and forth between the Rome of his own time and modern Japan, Thermae Romae Novae, despite the dubious Latin grammar in the title, provides an informative overview of Roman culture at the height of the Empire. The central theme is how ancient Rome and modern Japan have a commonality in the tradition of public bathhouses despite being otherwise separated by time and geographical distance. Naturally, customs around Roman public baths get a lot of focus, but the series always explores Roman architecture, features appearances by historical figures like the Emperor Hadrian, and demonstrates what day-to-day life was like for the average Roman.





 9  Godzilla Singular Point - Quantum Mechanics 
        

Reimagining Godzilla as a monstrosity from another dimension that threatens to destroy the laws of space-time, Godzilla Singular Point is quite science-heavy, so it requires an attentive watch or even multiple re-watches. Quantum mechanics is confusing at the best times, but it can be difficult to figure what exactly is supposed to be going on. Still, once the scientific exposition is unpacked, it provides a decent overview of the weirdness of quantum mechanics. Applying quantum theory to a Godzilla story is a novel approach both to the Godzilla mythos and the science.





 8  How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift? - Fitness 
        

Fittingly for a series about a high school girl with no previous experience at the gym, How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift? does an excellent job breaking down the why, how, and when of exercise. In addition to explaining the technique and science behind various exercises, the series also explains body mechanics and helpful fitness tips like the best time during the day to eat, and how to warm up or cool down. Each episode also features at least tutorial of an exercise that&#39;s simple enough for the viewers to replicate at home without any major equipment.





 7  Ya Boy Kongming! - Chinese History &amp; Literature 
       Ya Boy Kongming!/P.A. Works  

Legendary Three Kingdoms-era ancient Chinese strategist Zhuge Liang, also known by the name Kongming, is reincarnated in present-day Shibuya and takes it upon himself to become the manager of an aspiring young singer named Eiko. He approaches Eiko&#39;s musical career with the exact same seriousness and commitment as any of his battles during the Three Kingdoms, repurposing many of his famous strategies to suit the recording industry. Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is one of the most famous literary works in Eastern Asia, each episode of the series begins with an opening narration likening Kongming and Eiko&#39;s current situation to an event from the Three Kingdoms.





 6  My Dress-Up Darling - Cosplay 
        

My Dress-Up Darling has become famous for two things: a reliance on fanservice and the attention to detail it pays when explaining cosplay techniques. Working together, Gojo and Marin meticulously plan out each of her cosplays and do extensive research on the source material to find suitable references to design from. From there, the series goes to great lengths to explain the best choice of materials and describe the techniques behind actually sewing a costume. Once the actual costume is assembled, the series then gives a thorough explanation of how cosplayers use things like wigs and make-up to make themselves look more like their characters.





 5  Spice and Wolf - Economics 
        

Spice and Wolf uses a traveling merchant named Lawrence and an ancient goddess named Holo to discuss the economics of its world. Since Holo has no real context for things like the value of money or commodity markets, she has questions and Lawrence has answers. Throughout the series, Lawrence gets an opportunity to explain the importance of things like currency valuation, supply and demand, how social unrest affects markets, and even how to turn around a bad initial business deal to make a profit in the long run. Spice and Wolf is actually returning soon for a new season, so it&#39;s never been a better time to check out this classic.





 4  The Heike Story - Samurai History 
       The Heike Story/Science SARU.  

The Tale of Heike is one of the most important works of Japanese literature. The epic poem tells the story of the downfall of the Taira clan, also known as the Heike, and the rise to power of the rival Minamoto clan, the Genji, as well the early days of the samurai as Japan&#39;s elite warrior class. The Tale of the Heike has influenced Japanese art, culture, and media for centuries, with some of the most famous samurai in history featuring prominently. The Heike Story anime abridges the sprawling epic into an 11-episode series, but is nevertheless a good introduction to one of the most famous and important periods of Japanese history for viewers who may be unfamiliar with the time period.





 3  K-On! - Rock Bands 
       K-On!/Kyoto Animation.  

Kakifly, the mangaka of the anime&#39;s source material is a big music fan, and it shows. Most of the instruments the girls use are real models, drawn with true-to-life precision. There are frequent references to real-life rock legends. Since Yui is a complete novice at playing guitar, the other girls give explanations of music theory and technique. The episodes where the girls are playing their first gigs outside of school are a good look and the trials and tribulations of a new band trying to catch their big break.
            
 
 Every Anime Directed By Naoko Yamada, Ranked (According To IMDb) 
Since her directorial debut in 2009&#39;s K-On!, Naoko Yamada has quickly risen to become one of the anime industry&#39;s most prominent directorial talents.








 2  Walkure Romanze - Jousting 
       Walkure Romanze/Eight Bit.  

While the concept of a modern-day jousting school is pehaps a little hard to take seriously, most of the presentation of the actual jousting is on point in Walkure Romanze. The series&#39; world captures the notion of jousting as a hugely popular sport, even if it is presented as a deliberate ananchronism. Since the anime is based on a dating sim, it&#39;s not exactly surprising that certain liberties have been taken with the armor for the sake of fanservice, but the silver lining to that is that each girl is at least mostly covered and has a unique silhouette and color scheme that helps to differentiate them in their armor. On the other hand, Walkure Romanze is a rare fictional world where the characters actually keep their helmets on, a piece of logic on the characters&#39; part often missing in pop culture.





 1  Fullmetal Alchemist - Alchemy &amp; Chemistry 
        

Pop culture usually uses &#34;alchemy&#34; as just a fantasy-world way of saying &#34;chemistry&#34;, but real-world historical alchemy has a mystical, philosophical, and almost religious aspect. Alchemists weren&#39;t just trying to turn lead to gold because it was valuable, but also because gold was seen as a metaphysically purer and better substance than lead. Fullmetal Alchemist accurately represents the importance of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone as a major aspect of real-world alchemical pursuits and the transmutation circles used by Fullmetal Alchemist protagonist Edward Elric are drawn with symbols with real-world alchemical and mystical significance. On top of that, the properties of various real-world chemical elements and compounds are accurately described at various points in the series.
Plenty of anime are enjoyable, but the ones that truly stick with fans are series that are at least partially educational. Exceptional anime are able to be just as informative as they are entertaining. Anime like this can be a surprising source of real-world knowledge that might just be useful one day. The best educational anime teach fans something in an entertaining and interesting way.
