 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #16? 
          

Episode #16 featured two stories concerning friends from the past. The first saw Frieren reuniting with an old dwarf near the end of his life. The second and more notable story sees Sein continue his search for his lost friend. The priest asks some villagers at a fork in the road which way he went and they direct him towards an old lady who seems to know the answer. This old woman has Sein and his friends perform a bunch of errands for her before telling them what she knows. Unfortunately for the unity of the party, she tells them that Sein&#39;s friend went to the city of Tur, which is in the opposite direction Frieren needs to go.






The episode also hinted at more of Kraft&#39;s backstory






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #17 Will Show Sein&#39;s Choice 
          

Sein now faces the important choice of whether to leave Frieren&#39;s party to pursue his friend or to press on with their adventure and potentially lose his trail. Given he hasn&#39;t been traveling with them for that long, this may be an easy choice for him on an emotional level. However, the North can be dangerous to explore alone, so leaving the party may not be a practical choice for him. He could also try and convince Frieren, Fern, and Stark to accompany him to Tur. This would delay their own quest by quite a bit but Frieren&#39;s immortality has caused her to delay the party multiple times in the past anyway.
