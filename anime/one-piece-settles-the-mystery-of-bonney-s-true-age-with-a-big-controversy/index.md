## Literature Review

One Piece has finally settled the debate about Bonney&#39;s true age, but the reveal causes its fair share of controversy.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #1098 of One Piece. One Piece has at long last settled the mystery of Bonney&#39;s true age with its latest chapter finally revealing the circumstances of Bonney&#39;s birth as well as her true parentage. The Worst Generation member has been the focus of countless debates since entering into prominence in the Egghead Arc and the latest chapter confirms several suspicions about her.




Bonney&#39;s curious Devil Fruit that allows her to age both objects, herself, and the people around her has given rise to plenty of speculation given the abundant yet frightening possibilities of Bonney&#39;s devil fruit powers. Among the many theories about Jewelry Bonney that have surfaced since her re-introduction to the story, the theory that Bonney may be much younger than she lets on has gained the most traction with scattered hints by Saturn and Vegapunk only adding to the fire. Despite many fans having strongly dismissed this theory thus far Chapter #1098 finally settles the debate.

          

Chapter #1098 of One Piece has revealed that Bonney is twelve years old at present, and also the daughter of a Celestial Dragon. 


 Bonney Being Twelve Years Old Is Quite Controversial 
          




Bonney was born to Ginny after the latter was kidnapped and forced to be the wife of an unnamed Celestial Dragon who took a liking to her. The chapter also reveals that Ginny died of a mysterious disease shortly after Bonney was born, after which Bonney was adopted and raised by Kuma at the Sorbet Kingdom. Thus, Bonney is neither a Buccaneer nor Kuma&#39;s biological daughter, but partially a World Noble, making Kuma the only remaining survivor of the near-extinct Buccaneer race.

The chapter also reveals that Bonney also suffered from the same disease as Ginny which caused her to develop blue gem-like hardened lesions on her skin from exposure to the sun, leading to her future moniker &#39;Jewelry Bonney&#39;. Having said that, as shocking as this revelation may be, it has also sparked controversy given the many instances the manga has sexualized Bonney since her very introduction in One Piece. The most infamous occurrence was when Blackbeard attempted to seduce her in chapter #594, and these instances definitely come across as rather unsavory now that the series has revealed Bonney is not even a teenager in reality.






 Bonney&#39;s True Age Was Hinted All Along 
          

As Bonney was nowhere to be seen throughout the second half of Ginny and Kuma&#39;s backstory in Chapter #1097 fans had all but discarded the idea of Bonney being a child, returning to other popular theories of her being a clone of Big Mom or Ginny instead. However, the truth about Bonney&#39;s true age seems to have been hinted at as early as Chapter #1089 when Saint Saturn first referred to Bonney as &#39;just a girl&#39; and later in Chapter #1093 where Vegapunk once again referred to Bonney as a little child. Many fans were also quick to notice that Bonney did not produce gems of wisdom when using her powers on herself as opposed to when she used her powers to turn Vegapunk into a child in Chapter #1060.

Most importantly, Bonney was first introduced on Egghead in child form when the Straw Hats found her stuck in the warm eddy outside the island, proving that the seawater had indeed deactivated the effects of her devil fruit and that Bonney has been constantly aging herself up throughout the series. While the reveal of Bonney&#39;s true age will certainly spark controversy in light of her previous depictions and interactions, she has certainly made history as the youngest known pirate in One Piece to date, having become a member of the notorious Worst Generation at only ten years old.
