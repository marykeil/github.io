# Pokémon Horizons Reveals Its New Villains  Secret Origin


## SUMMARY 



  The evil group known as the Explorers may have more complex motives than fans initially thought.   The Explorers were once friends and supporters of the Ancient Adventurer Lucius, who owned the pendant that the heroes have been seeking. This suggests that the group is over a hundred years old and may have changed over time.   It is possible that the Explorers&#39; true goal is not the Pokémon Terapagos itself, but a place called Rakua, and Terapagos is crucial in finding it. The group&#39;s interest in the rest of Lucius&#39;s Pokémon supports this theory.

## Literature Review

Episode 25 of Pokémon Horizons revealed a tantalizing tidbit about the origins of the series&#39; villains, the Explorers, with their motive in question.




Warning: Spoilers for Pokémon Horizons Episode #25The evil group who have been hounding Pokémon Horizons&#39; heroes, the Explorers, have finally had their origins unveiled, and it seems the group&#39;s motives may be more complex than they appeared. After 25 episodes of seeking Liko&#39; pendant, fans have finally been offered a clue as to why they&#39;re so desperate to obtain it.




The Explorers have been after Liko&#39;s pendant, which recently transformed into the mysterious Pokémon Terapagos, but the reason why is unclear, other than their Boss, Gibeon, ordering it. It was revealed that prior to Liko obtaining the pendant, they attempted to befriend Liko&#39;s grandmother, Diana, but she turned them down, despite being approached by a long-time friend.

          

Diana, however, didn&#39;t learn the group&#39;s name at that time, and only heard it during the attack in episode 25. Diana was stunned to hear the group were known as the Explorers, as the Explorers were once friends and supporters of the Ancient Adventurer Lucius, who originally owned the pendant.


 The Explorers Began as Lucius&#39;s Loyal Allies 
          




Diana&#39;s recognition of the Explorers as being associated with Lucius provides some interesting insight into this group, which may suggest they aren&#39;t totally evil. If the Explorers were friends of Lucius during his adventuring days, then the organization is over a hundred years old, at least. That of course means that the group today isn&#39;t necessarily as it once was, with plenty of time to have changed. It also explains how they were even aware of the pendant&#39;s existence--they likely have the best records on Lucius of anyone in the entire Pokémon world.

According to Lucius&#39;s legend, he traveled the Pokémon world until finally finding a place known as Rakua, a paradise. It&#39;s possible that the Explorers&#39; true goal isn&#39;t necessarily the rare Pokémon Terapagos itself, but actually Rakua, and Terapagos is merely essential to finding it. The group also showed some interest in Lucius&#39;s other Pokémon, such as the Black Rayquaza. Given that Diana told Liko and Roy to seek out the rest of Lucius&#39;s Pokémon, it may be that his team is also important to gaining access to Rakua. With both the Explorers and the Rising Volt Tacklers looking to gather these Pokémon, it naturally puts the two groups at odds.




The Explorers&#39; motive is still not absolutely clear, but their connection with Lucius might mean their original goal isn&#39;t malicious. It&#39;s possible that they are, in some way, acting on Lucius&#39;s wishes from long ago, perhaps with their true goal being to protect Rakua from outsiders. Of course, the group&#39;s behavior has hardly been that of a benevolent organization, between the hypnotism, kidnapping, and general destruction. This dark direction might be new, however, with Gibeon effectively hijacking the group towards his own ends. Just what the truth is about Pokémon Horizons&#39; enemy organization will only be revealed with more time, but for now, there&#39;s some great information to speculate upon.
