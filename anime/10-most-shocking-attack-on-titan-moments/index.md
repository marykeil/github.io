Unfortunately for him, he was dealing with the Beast Titan, and after being taken down by five other Titans, he was captured by the Beast.

Eren had finally become a skilled soldier, capable of fighting against the Titans. As he stood atop the wall, he was filled with determination when, suddenly, the Colossal Titan appeared and created a gaping hole in the wall. Many new soldiers were blown away in the destruction, and Eren was reminded of the events in his hometown, Shiganshina, by the Colossal and Armored Titans. Fueled by anger at the thought of his mother&#39;s death, he heroically lunged at the Titan, but it disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.





 8  Ramzi And Halil&#39;s Tragedy 
The Final Chapters Special 1


 







Despite having less than five minutes of screen time in the show, Ramzi&#39;s death had a big impact on Attack on Titan&#39;s story, as it showed just how evil and wicked Eren was for killing the majority of humanity. Ramzi and Eren met each other after helping him when the boy was being beaten for stealing. Eren took Ramzi back to his home and broke down in tears, knowing that he&#39;d have to kill the young boy when he activated the Rumbling and apologized profusely. This disturbing scene highlighted the consequences of Eren&#39;s genocidal plan, and Eren&#39;s conflicted mental state.





 7  Eren&#39;s Death 
The Final Chapters Special 2


It&#39;s very rare that a main character in anime dies, but Eren was on a path that he could never come back from, and he had to die. After exterminating 80 percent of humanity outside the walls, Eren is taken down by his former friends and enemies, putting a stop to his plans. His death was made even more shocking by the fact that it was Mikasa – his childhood friend and love interest – who delivered the final blow. A fitting end for one of the most complex characters in anime, Eren&#39;s character development was incredible to witness and made the show that much better.

After an incredible and deadly fight between Annie and Eren, Annie attempted to escape by climbing the walls as the Scouts trapped her. She climbed up and made holes in the wall but was stopped by Mikasa and was captured. Shockingly, a hole in the wall made by Annie revealed a huge Titan the size of the Colossal Titan inside.

The Return To Shiganshina although successful, had an incredible number of casualties, with only a handful of Scouts, including the main characters, surviving. The mission featured two missions: taking down the Beast Titan and, on the other side of the wall, taking down the Armored and Colossal Titan. Erwin led the Scouts to their death in order to distract the Beast, so Levi could neutralize them, and Armin was burned alive trying to take down the Colossal. Levi now had Zeke and Titan serum, which he could use to revive someone on the brink of death. Faced with the decision to bring back Armin or Erwin, Levi decided to let Erwin rest after years of suffering and fighting.

In a desperate attempt by Zeke to convince Eren that the euthanization plan was the way to go, Zeke used the power of the Paths to go back in time and showed Eren past events to try and prove his point. He showed Eren when Grisha, their father, killed the Reiss Family. He did this to show him how evil their father was, but he never expected that it was Eren&#39;s future self that convinced Grisha to kill them and gain the power of the Founding Titan.
