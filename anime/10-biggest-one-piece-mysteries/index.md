## Literature Review

One of the major appeals of One Piece is surely its many mysteries, with some that are still puzzling fans 30 years later.




One of the biggest trademarks of One Piece is its penchant for setting up mysteries. The series will often set up mysterious bits about its characters or worldbuilding that won’t be resolved until years or decades after the fact, and paying attention to the development of each mystery makes their eventual reveals all the more satisfying.
There are certainly a lot of mysteries in One Piece, and sure enough, some are far bigger mysteries than others. Even as it enters its final saga, there are many mysteries in One Piece that have gone years and decades without being resolved with only the faintest of hints towards their explanations. While some could be innocuous in the grand scheme of things, many of them are, without a doubt, some of the most vital parts of the entire story. It’s unknown when any of them will be resolved, so until then, it’s important to lay each of them out in as much detail as possible.
        










 








 10  The Identity Of Caribou’s Mysterious Partner 
Who Is Caribou Working With?
        

One big mystery in One Piece is the identity of Caribou’s mysterious partner. Whenever Caribou has learned major information from the Straw Hats, most notably that Shirahoshi is Poseidon and that Pluton is hidden in Wano, he thinks about telling someone about it, but after so many years, the identity of said person has yet to be revealed. If they’re someone who would be interested in the Ancient Weapons, then they’re likely to be a major player in the world of One Piece, so the eventual reveal of their identity is sure to be a big event in the series.





 9  The Whereabouts &amp; True Form Of The Ancient Weapon Uranus 
The Final Ancient Weapon
        

Regarding the Ancient Weapons, another mystery that has to be addressed at some point is the whereabouts and true form of the last Ancient Weapon Uranus. Pluton is a powerful ship currently hidden in Wano and Poseidon is the ability to communicate with Sea Kings that’s currently been inherited by Shirahoshi, but nothing about Uranus’ abilities or its location has been revealed yet. Recent chapters have offered the theory that the Mother Flame, Imu’s secret weapon capable of destroying entire islands, is either powered by Uranus or Uranus itself, but there has yet to be any confirmation of that, and it’s unknown when Uranus will explicitly come into play.





 8  Imu’s True Identity &amp; Goals In One Piece 
One Piece&#39;s True Villain


 







Going off of that, one of the biggest mysteries in One Piece is undoubtedly Imu’s identity and motivations. Ever since their debut, Imu has been one of the most enigmatic characters in the entire franchise, with little to nothing about their past, motivations, or even their physical appearance being made known even after so many years. The Egghead Island arc has heavily implied that Imu is Saint Imu of the Nerona Family who was made immortal by the Ope-Ope Fruit after the founding of the World Government, but even that has yet to be confirmed, so Imu remains one of the biggest mysteries in all of One Piece.





 7  The True Identity Of The Man With The Burn Scar 
The Man Who Holds The Final Road Poneglyph
        

Another mystery surrounding a fairly recent addition to the story is the identity of the man with the burn scar. While he was only first referenced at the end of the Wano arc, the man with the burn scar allegedly possesses the last Road Poneglyph, meaning that finding them is essential for anyone who wants to go to Laugh Tale and become the Pirate King. There have been several theories about the man with the burn scar’s identity, but there has yet to be any confirmation of anything, and it’s unknown how long it will take for his true identity to be revealed in the series.





 6  The True Identity Of The Person Crocus Shared A Drink With 
Crocus&#39; Mysterious Friend
        

For an older mystery in One Piece that has yet to be resolved, one that immediately comes to mind is the identity of whoever Crocus shared a drink with. In the first cover story following the timeskip, Crocus was shown having a drink with someone at Reverse Mountain, and over a decade later, that person’s identity has yet to be revealed. Considering how Crocus was a former member of the Roger Pirates, it would make sense for Crocus to have been sharing a drink with someone very important to the story, but who that person might be is still a mystery that has yet to be solved.





 5  Nika’s History &amp; Role In One Piece 
Who Is Nika?
        

The Sun God Nika is another fairly recent addition to One Piece, but there’s already a lot of mystery surrounding him. Nika was first introduced near the end of the Wano arc and since then he has already been established as not only the first explicit god in One Piece and a heroic figure to the Buccaneers and the slaves of the world, but also the power source of Luffy’s Devil Fruit, which is revealed to really be the Human-Human Fruit Model: Nika. There are a lot of heavy implications about Nika’s role in the story, but what One Piece will do with them is still very much up in the air.





 4  Joyboy’s History &amp; Role In One Piece 
Who Is Joyboy?
        

Following from Nika, another character with a lot of mystery surrounding them is Joyboy. Joyboy has been an enigmatic figure since the early days of the post-timeskip era with his mysterious connection to Fishman Island’s history, and the Wano arc further added to his importance by revealing that Joyboy left the truths of the world at Laugh Tale and was the previous wielder of the Gum-Gum Fruit, which is actually the Human-Human Fruit Model: Nika. Despite only ever being mentioned in the past tense, Joyboy is clearly one of the most important characters in One Piece’s lore, so his history definitely needs to be explored at some point.





 3  Why Blackbeard Can Use Two Devil Fruits 
What&#39;s So Special About Blackbeard?


 







Of all the lengthy mysteries in One Piece, there are few as noteworthy as Blackbeard’s ability to use two Devil Fruits. Blackbeard being able to use Whitebeard’s Tremor-Tremor Fruit breaks the rule about people only being able to eat one Devil Fruit, and so far, the only clue as to how Blackbeard could use two Devil Fruits is Marco saying that there’s something odd about his body, but even that hasn’t been elaborated on. Blackbeard will undoubtedly be one of the last villains for Luffy to fight before One Piece ends, and before their fight is finished, the mystery of how his body works needs to be answered.





 2  What Luffy Wants To Do After Becoming The Pirate King 
Luffy&#39;s Dream


 







Regarding Luffy, another big mystery in One Piece is what Luffy plans to do after becoming the Pirate King. While it initially seemed like Luffy was only after the freedom of adventure, recent developments have established that Luffy&#39;s actual dream is not becoming the Pirate King, as that will only be a means to his end. This not only has shocked everyone who’s heard it, but could also be the same goal Roger had wanted to accomplish before he died. The truth of Luffy’s dream is bound to say a lot about his character, but as it stands, there’s no way of knowing when it will finally be revealed.





 1  What The One Piece Actually Is 
What Is Every Pirate In The World Actually After?
        

The biggest mystery in One Piece, however, is what the titular One Piece actually is. Obtaining the One Piece and becoming the Pirate King has been the goal of nearly every pirate since the beginning of the series, and 27 years later, the most that’s known about the One Piece is that it was left on Laugh Tale by Joyboy, and seeing it causes Roger and his crew to laugh from the bottom of their hearts. Whatever the entire treasure ends up being, it’s bound to completely change the world of One Piece, and with the series having entered its final saga, fans can for the first time look forward to the day that this, and all other big One Piece mysteries, will finally be unveiled.
