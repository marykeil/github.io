# Only One Pokémon is Actually True Evil, &amp; It s Not One Fans Would Expect


## SUMMARY 



  In the Pokemon anime, most evil deeds are carried out by Pokemon under the influence of their trainers, but a few episodes introduce a pure evil Pokemon.   &#34;A Conspiracy to Conquer!&#34; episode reveals a hypnotic Malamar controlling Team Rocket and Officer Jenny, with plans for world conquest.   Malamar&#39;s high intelligence and psychic powers make it a dangerous villain, and there may be other evil Pokemon out there with similar capabilities.

## Literature Review

A Pokémon acting on its own evil desires became a menace in the Pokémon anime, and it proves how terrifying a truly evil Pokémon would really be.




In the Pokémon anime in general, there aren&#39;t really many evil Pokémon, but rather Pokémon that do evil deeds because their trainers demanded it of them. A few episodes of XY, however, do away with that excuse, by introducing a Pokémon that&#39;s pure evil, and the result is absolutely terrifying to think about.




In the episode &#34;A Conspiracy to Conquer!&#34;, Team Rocket falls victim to a mysterious woman going by &#34;Madame X&#34; and her Pokémon, Malamar, which hypnotizes them and controls their actions. Meowth escapes and gets help from Ash and the gang, but slowly everyone except for Meowth and Ash fall victim to the Malamar, giving it half a dozens humans and all their Pokémon at its bidding. Things get even worse, however, when it&#39;s revealed that Madame X is actually Officer Jenny--and she&#39;s being mind controlled, too. Malamar itself was the mastermind behind this evil scheme, and it promptly escapes, ready to continue its plans to conquer the world.


 Malamar Proves How Dangerous Intelligent Pokémon Could Be 
          

The Malamar in the episode is clearly very intelligent to be capable of coming up with such a plan, and its psychic powers seem equally impressive, given how many people it was able to control at once. Malamar is a rare example of an evil Pokémon that&#39;s not being influenced in any way, and simply acting on its own desires. Malamar actually goes on to appear later, returning in &#34;Facing the Grand Design!&#34;, where it has teamed up with two other Malamar to brainwash scientists into creating a dangerous weapon. The Malamar, however, actually manage to escape in this episode as well, but don&#39;t show up again--meaning there&#39;s still world-conquering evil Pokémon out there.




Malamar never explains its motivations for wanting to take over the world; it seems to simply think that it can and should. While it&#39;s possible that Malamar is out for vengeance in some way, like Mewtwo, it doesn&#39;t appear to have a particular target in mind. Their extremely high intelligence might suggest that they were experimented upon, although by who or why is a mystery. It&#39;s worth noting that this evil nature doesn&#39;t apply to all Malamar; in the second episode where it appears, some friendly Inkay and Malamar help to foil the evil Malamar&#39;s plans.



 Evil Pokémon Could Threaten the World 
          

Fortunately, evil Pokémon seem to be pretty rare, but given the sheer number of wild Pokémon in the world, there must be many more out there. The powers that Pokémon wield, even those who aren&#39;t Psychic-types like Malamar, have a lot of potential for destruction. Even a few evil Pokémon that wish harm on humans could cause massive amounts of strife and suffering with their abilities. Perhaps defeating evil-minded Pokémon is a task that falls to Legendary Pokémon, many of which are said to maintain balance and peace. Regardless, there are still at least three terrifyingly smart and powerful evil Pokémon out there, free to act as they wish... and Ash might not be there to stop them next time.
