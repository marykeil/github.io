## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Z established that Frieza is a world-conquering villain of the highest order, but one Dragon Ball GT villain actually manages to top him. 





Before he made his official first appearance, Frieza’s influence was felt in the Dragon Ball universe as he was the one responsible for blowing up Planet Vegeta and essentially wiping out the Saiyan race from existence. As it turned out, Planet Vegeta wasn’t the first (or last) planet Frieza would eradicate as he had no problem killing billions of life forms at once if it meant strengthening his empire (or if he just needed a laugh). However, just because Frieza blew up the occasional planet doesn’t mean he was a complete madman–he did have an empire to run, after all. In fact, the vast majority of the planets under Frieza’s rule were virtually unchanged by his influence beyond the fact that they were within Frieza’s empire and therefore had to abide by his laws. Basically, Frieza’s reputation seems to be more soulless than his day-to-day operating practices as not every planet he comes across is necessarily doomed–though the same cannot be said for GT’s world-conqueror.




                  Dragon Ball Z Fans Were Robbed of One Important Fight   Dragon Ball Z has never held back when showing fans an epic battle, but the manga skipped perhaps one of the most important in the entire DBZ series.    


 Machine Mutants Make Every Dragon Ball Planet they Take Over Unlivable 
          

In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 17 (written by Atsushi Maekawa, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), Pan, Goku, and Trunks find themselves on the planet M-2 after their friend (and newly sentient Dragon Radar) Gill says that the planet was his home before he was lost in the cosmos. So, since Gill has been accepted as a part of the crew, the team decides to pay his home a quick visit before continuing on their quest to find the Black Star Dragon Balls. When they land, however, they realize that they had just walked into a trap set by the villainous Dr. Myuu and his team of Machine Mutants known as the Sigma Force–super androids beyond anything the Z-Fighters have battled before. After Goku and Trunks are captured by the Sigma Force, Pan comes up with a plan to free them, and that leads her to an area where abandoned Machine Mutants were left to die by their creator–and where Pan learns the truth about this planet and the Machine Mutants’ purpose in the cosmos as directed by Dr. Myuu.




The abandoned Machine Mutants tell Pan why they were created by Dr. Myuu in the first place, and the truth behind their existence is grim to say the least. Dr. Myuu was a brilliant scientist who created the Machine Mutants to be an unstoppable army that could march across the universe and take over any planet they came across in his name. If this sounds incredibly similar to what Frieza is known for doing, it should, as it is practically the same villainous plan for universal domination–but with a dark catch. While Frieza leaves most of the planets he conquers relatively unchanged, every single planet Dr. Myuu conquers with his Machine Mutants becomes unlivable for organic life. The terraforming process used by the Machine Mutants turns the entire planet into one big machine–transforming an entire world into a celestial ball of metal.

Since those on the planets Frieza conquers at least have a chance of living normal lives under his rule, and the ones Dr. Myuu takes over have no chance of survival at all, it is clear that Dragon Ball GT’s planet-conquering villain is even worse than Frieza.
