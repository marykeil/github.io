Many fans are understandably sad to see the iconic protagonists&#39; departure earlier this year, though it is possible they&#39;ll make a return in the future. Regardless of their potential return, Ash and Pikachu&#39;s adventures are some of the most iconic anime inspired by a video game ever.

The anime follows main character Tsukasa whose mind is trapped in a virtual fantasy game called The World. Tsukasa&#39;s journeys in The World are filled with mystery, as are the circumstances surrounding the real life of Tsukasa and the other characters they meet in the game.
