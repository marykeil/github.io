# 10 Strangest Anime Weapons That Are Surprisingly Powerful

These strange weapons range from a living spear that shapeshifts to a dog-gun that fires exploding baseballs, showcasing the creativity in anime.   Despite their unusual nature, these bizarre weapons highlight the skill and uniqueness of the characters, setting them apart from conventional weapons in the genre.

## Literature Review

Sometimes, anime characters can use some truly unlikely weapons to win the day. Here are the weirdest anime weapons that turned out shockingly strong.




When it comes to anime, the rules of what is and isn&#39;t a weapon are surprisingly fluid, with some truly unconventional weapons proving to be surprisingly powerful. In fact, some of the medium&#39;s most bizarre weapons of all tend to stand out for not really even resembling weapons at all.




Often times, these strange weapon choices are thematic to the character using them, explaining their odd choice as a consequence of who they are. Sometimes, they&#39;ve simply found themselves in possession of a strange object that turns out to be extremely powerful, and it winds up becoming their weapon of choice. And of course, some of these are originally intended to be weapons, but are so absolutely bizarre in their traits or construction that one might not even recognize them as a weapon at first glance.


 The Lance of Longinus 
Neon Genesis Evangelion
          

The Lance (or sometimes Spear) of Longinus is a strange, two-pronged spear that is discovered in the Antarctic. The two prongs intertwine in a helix-like formation, resembling DNA. It&#39;s an alien weapon that arrived on Earth long before humankind existed, and it has the capacity to break through the AT fields which are essential to an EVA&#39;s defenses, and which keep people as separate beings. Weirdest of all, the Lance is technically alive itself, and it often shapeshifts after it is thrown. In the Evangelion TV series, the Lance is lost when Rei must throw it into orbit in order to destroy the attacking Angel, Arael, but it&#39;s not the only one of its kind...






 The Cross Punisher 
Trigun Stampede
         

The Cross Punisher is the signature weapon of Nicholas Wolfwood, and its massive size gives an accurate impression of its destructive power. The Cross Punisher has several different means of attacking, including machine gun-like rapid fire and a beam weapon. Its bulky size makes it an effective melee weapon as well, and it can even provide some cover. The Cross Punisher is noted to be exceptionally heavy, which Wolfwood claims is because &#34;it&#39;s so full of mercy.&#34; It&#39;s not one of a kind, as other characters are occasionally seen using them, but they are exceptionally rare and unique weapons that only a select few can handle.



 Lassoo 
One Piece
          




Lassoo is a gun belonging to Mr. 4 which ate a &#34;Dog-Dog Fruit&#34; and became part Dachshund, making this a living weapon. It was once a bazooka, and the process of how this weapon ate a fruit is an absolute mystery within the series. This gives it the capacity to move and aim on its own, firing baseball-like exploding cannonballs, which it has a seemingly limitless number of. Mr. 4 is capable of hitting these baseballs with tremendous force, redirecting their aim and making them much harder to dodge. Amusingly, the dog-gun dreams of someday becoming a tank, showing that even living weapons can have ambitions.

Kagura&#39;s Fan
Inuyasha
          

Kagura is a sorceress of the wind in Inuyasha, and as such possesses a fan which allows her to control and create wind-based attacks. Using the fan, Kagura can create blades of wind or even entire tornadoes, which can devastate opponents. Its most unique power, however, is the &#34;Dance of the Dead,&#34; which allows Kagura to control dead bodies using the wind, reanimating them for her own purposes. Kagura isn&#39;t one to really fight directly, so a weapon like this which allows her to keep her distance from enemies is a good fit for her character.






 Blinky 
Hunter X Hunter
          

Shizuku is a member of the Phantom Troupe and a Nen user, specifically a conjurer. Her ability allows her to summon a vacuum cleaner named &#34;Blinky,&#34; which has eyes on its main body and a mouth at the end of the vacuum hose. It has a limitless capacity, able to suck up as much non-living material as Shizuku wants. It&#39;s not known what happens to objects she sucks up, with only the most recent item able to be ejected from the vacuum&#39;s tank. Shizuku&#39;s most deadly attack is, once an opponent is bleeding, ordering Blinky to vacuum up all their blood, leaving the body squeezed dry of every drop.



 Capture Cloth 
My Hero Academia
         




The Capture Cloth (or sometimes &#34;Capture Weapon&#34;) is a scarf that is always worn by Shota Aizawa, a U.A. teacher and a pro hero known by the name of Eraser Head. Since Aizawa&#39;s Quirk allows him to deactivate the Quirks of others, it affords him no offensive power, so Aizawa had to train with this cloth to entrap enemies once they&#39;re powerless. The cloth is made of carbon nanofibers, making it nearly indestructible and unable to be cut. Aizawa isn&#39;t the only one to use such a weapon, however; he later trains Hitoshi Shinso to use one as well, since he similarly has a Quirk which affords him no offense.



 Killua&#39;s Yo-Yos 
Hunter X Hunter
         

Hunter X Hunter might be the king of bizarre weapons, but Killua&#39;s Yo-Yos stand out as one of the oddest. The two Yo-Yos themselves are said to weigh over a hundred pounds each, and are made with a special alloy that&#39;s strong enough to withstand use and which conducts electricity well. Killua uses them most heavily in the later chapters of the series, and is able to funnel his Nen abilities through them as well. Killua uses the sheer weight of them to attack opponents, but also makes use of fancy maneuvers that make the direction of attack difficult to predict.






 Disciplinary Rulebooks 
Kill La Kill
          

During the Tri-City Raid, Ira Gamagoori leads a group attacking a school in Kobe, Japan. His primary weapon of choice, both for himself and his men, is the school rulebook. The books seem to be easily thrown, and are capable of shattering protective football gear upon impact. The book is also shown to be able to grow in size, allowing the members of Gamagoori&#39;s squad to use them as cover against enemy attacks. Gamagoori claims that it&#39;s the heavy burden of the rules themselves which make these books such effective weapons.



 Haruko&#39;s Bass Guitar 
FLCL
          




FLCL is a bizarre series in just about every way, but by far one of its strangest and most notable aspects is Haruko&#39;s predilection to using guitars in battle. Haruko primarily obtains these guitars via a nearby teenager&#39;s N.O. portal, pulling it directly out of their foreheads. The guitar itself varies, and Haruko can often identify them on sight, particularly if it&#39;s a rare model, as the rarer the guitar, the more powerful it seems to be. Haruko is also shown using the guitar to fly in one episode, and cranks it like a chainsaw in another. With it, she takes down towering Kaiju-like monsters with surprising ease.



 Hyper-Density Seals 
My Hero Academia
          

As a salaryman hero with a Quirk not well-suited to battle, Sir Nighteye uses these heavy stamps (intended for signing documents) as throwing weapons. Weighing around 11 pounds each, Sir Nighteye carries half a dozen or more of them around at a time, and can strike opponents with them with incredible accuracy. While these may not be the strongest attacks, they&#39;re more than capable of taking down villains with a well-aimed strike, often catching them by surprise.




While most of the weapons here wouldn&#39;t be very much use in real life, they&#39;ve all proven to be fantastically useful in the worlds in which they come from, even though most of them are considered strange choices even within their home universe. These characters&#39; abilities to use such strange weapons are often a testament to their skill, and while many of them could use something more conventional... why would they? By giving anime characters such bizarre weapons, creators give their works their own unique shine, and help them to stand out from the crowd.
