## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #5 will bring the building conflicts created in episode #4 to a head and set the bar for the rest of the arc.




After introducing a new plot that&#39;s a bit closer to home in episode #4, The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #5 is poised to see both Cid&#39;s new plan develop and introduce a major new threat. Of course when it comes to battling new threats Cid can defeat them quite handily given his insanely strong abilities. But what makes this new threat different is that it might not come at him directly, instead striking a major blow to his organization.

 What Happened in The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #4? 
          




Episode #4 introduced a major conflict between the Mitsugoshi company that Shadow Garden runs and the Major Corporate Alliance. This conflict manifests both in economic competition, with the Major Corporate Alliance trying to undercut Mitsugoshi prices as well as making their own currency, and in physical violence with Shadow Garden having to fight hired bandits. In the midst of this chaos, Cid joins forces with Yukime to try and take down both organizations and make a pretty penny doing it. He does this with a new personality, John Smith, who is supposed to be something like a suave secret agent, proving once again how great The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s Hero is.



 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #5 Will Exacerbate The Conflict 
          

While episode #4 was mainly just set up, it looks like episode #5 will start to pay off some of these plot threads. Given the menacing nature of the leader of the Major Corporate Alliance Gettan, and his potential connection to both Yukime and Delta the fight against him could have some major emotional stakes. In addition that conflict could be hard for Cid to win if it is done through economic manipulation instead of physical combat. Although given Cid and Yukime seem ready to put their plan to counterfeit a large number of bills into action soon, they may be the ones doing most of the economic manipulation. This plan could put Cid into conflict with both the Major Corporate Alliance and his own organization Shadow Garden.




While this latest arc of The Eminence in Shadow may not be as exciting to some fans as a large-scale vampire battle, given its stakes it may even be better than the season&#39;s opening plot line. It may also push Cid to his limits in a way that fans haven&#39;t seen before and prove once again why The Eminence in Shadow is an incredible Isekai. The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #5 will be a good barometer for how exciting this arc will actually be given it will likely feature the first major battles of this storyline.

Don&#39;t miss The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #5 when it airs on HIDIVE on November 1, 2023.
