## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1086 will hopefully show what&#39;s next for the anime after its recent long-running Wano arc concluded in episode #1085.




With the end of episode #1085, One Piece is now officially out of the Wano arc and moving into the much anticipated Egghead Island arc with episode #1086. The end of this arc is bittersweet as it leaves behind many fan-favorite characters but also lets the anime explore a whole new storyline. Fans also can&#39;t be too upset at Wano&#39;s ending given how cathartic it was.

 What Happened in Episode #1085 of One Piece? 
          




Episode #1085 focused on the Straw Hats’ final departure from the land of Wano and featured their final farewells to some important characters. Upon hearing the Straw Hats were leaving, Momonosuke and Kin&#39;emon quickly left the palace to meet them before they left. Luffy gave a tearful Momo a copy of the Straw Hat Jolly Roger and told him that even after leaving he would always be one of them. With this farewell given, Luffy, Law, and Kid&#39;s pirate crews all left Wano behind them in search of new adventures. The episode also showed the people of Wano watching a play dramatizing the events of the raid and revealing the hated villain Orochi&#39;s fitting fate.



The Straw Hats said farewell to many of Wano&#39;s other characters in episode #1084.






 One Piece Episode #1086 Will Begin The Final Saga 
          




With Wano closing out the saga that began after the time skip, One Piece is entering into what its creator Eiichiro Oda has called its Final Saga. While this means the series is now in its final stages, there are still a variety of locations the Straw Hats still have to visit and a number of important things they must do. The anime has released promotional art hinting at the look of the next arc taking place on Egghead Island, which looks to be a futuristic contrast to Wano&#39;s classical Japanese style.

This will likely make for a refreshing change of setting that reaffirms the incredible potential for One Piece&#39;s setting. Given this is the prelude of the Final Saga, the upcoming arc will hopefully also include some major lore reveals pertaining to some of One Piece&#39;s biggest mysteries. While One Piece episode #1086 likely won&#39;t delve too deep into any of these factors yet, it will still hopefully serve as a great bridge between Wano and whatever comes next.

Catch One Piece episode #1086 when it releases on Crunchyroll on December 2, 2023.
