Warning: The following contains spoilers for Overtake! episode 6, available now on Crunchyroll!




Overtake!, a brand new anime streaming on Crunchyroll, has displayed inventive writing in its sixth episode, showing the anime&#39;s capacity for unpredictability despite the formulaic nature of the sports genre. Using the episode&#39;s major race as a point of conflict, the anime was able to completely upend expectations while still providing important character development. It&#39;s an encouraging sign that the show has plenty of twists left for the next half of its story.

While the anime follows an underdog racing team, episode 6 of Overtake! shows that the writers are aware of genre clichés, and how to avoid them. While Madoka and Haruka&#39;s argument could have led to a typical racing sequence, what results instead is ultimately more interesting. These sorts of twists are a good sign that Overtake! has more than enough story to carry it through to the finale.

 Haruka&#39;s Race Builds His Character Rather Than Rewards Him

The episode shows Haruka and Madoka seemingly at the top of their game, with Haruka earning an excellent starting position in the next race that could very well land him on the winner&#39;s podium, finally. Their confidence is tested, however, when the racetrack comes under a rainstorm, creating the same conditions that led to Haruka&#39;s father dying in a previous race. This creates a gamble for all the race teams: keep using slick tires and hope the weather improves, or switch to rain tires even if they perform worse on dry asphalt? Should Komaki Motors heed caution or trust their luck?

          




Haruka&#39;s speech is quite inspirational, as he attests that his father&#39;s death is its own thing and that his own confidence and talent mean that he should be able to survive the wet weather on slick tires. In most stories, this is the turning point for the underdog, as thematically, the protagonist overcomes his father&#39;s ghost and his failures. Instead, Madoka skewers this formula with his own experience: if one winds up regretting their mistakes, it&#39;s not worth it, and the photographer implores them to use rain tires. For Haruka, the lack of confidence is a slap in the face.

Despite that, the plot ultimately sides with Madoka: regardless of Haruka&#39;s boasting, the rainstorm worsens, to the point the driver cuts his losses and forfeits the race that, on a sunny day, might have given him a win. It&#39;s a surprising but considered move that chooses to display Haruka&#39;s newfound maturity, rather than just record his rise to the top athletically. In this sense, Overtake! has greater ambitions with its storytelling: it wants to see its cast grow and develop, not just win trophies. With another six episodes left, Overtake looks like it&#39;s not going to settle for anything ordinary.
