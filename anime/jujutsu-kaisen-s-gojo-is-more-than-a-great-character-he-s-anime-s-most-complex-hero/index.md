## Literature Review

While jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Gojo Satoru is popular among fans for a number of aesthetic reasons, he&#39;s far more than just another over-powered shonen hero.





Born to the Gojo Clan, Gojo Satoru&#39;s mere existence has driven away powerful curses simply out of fear for having to face him head on. He is an enigma, as people often mistake him for a selfless hero – which he&#39;s capable of – but his particular brand of heroism is far more nuanced than he lets on.




                  A Naruto Character Inspired Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Gojo (But Not Who You Think)   Many fans have wrongly guessed that Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Satoru Gojo was inspired by Kakashi Hitake from Naruto based on his appearance and skills.   


 Who Is Gojo Satoru? 
          

Gojo Satoru is a Jujutsu sorcerer and teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High. He&#39;s also known for being the strongest sorcerer alive and is usually traveling around Japan and the world eliminating powerful enemies. As the figurehead of the prestigious Gojo Clan, in addition to his other feats, Satoru happens to be a descendant of the powerful Michizane Sugawara, a mighty sorcerer from hundreds of years ago during the Golden Age of Jujutsu.

Gojo Satoru possesses a complex personality. He appears to be very kind when it comes to his students and other individuals that he respects – cracking jokes and teasing them. However, his attitude can shift easily to bitterness, especially towards the old leaders of Jujutsu society who have gotten in his way many times and even tried killing one of his students Yuji Itadori. He works hard to foster the future generation of sorcerers by teaching and recruiting promising students such as Fushiguro Megumi, Itadori Yuju, Yuta Okkotsu, and Hakari. In order to replace the inefficient leaders, he hopes his students will lead the way for sorcerers and become powerful.






 Gojo Satoru&#39;s Powers 
          

Gojo&#39;s unique powers comes from his lineage. As a member of the Gojo Clan, he was born with the Limitless technique, an extremely powerful ability exclusive to his family members. In addition to that, he also has the Six Eyes, a combo that is unheard of within his clan, and in the world of Jujutsu sorcery. His Limitless and Six Eyes work together to make him insanely powerful. The Limitless Technique has three states: the neutral state Infinity, the amplified state Blue and the reversed state Red. To best understand his Limitless and its variations, a bit of math is required.



 Neutral Limitless: Infinity 
          




The neutral state works in the same way as convergent sequences – the longer the pattern is, the lower the next value becomes until ther&#39;s almost no difference between the previous and next number. Take for example the pattern 1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16,and 1/32; the pattern moves forward, but the next numbers become lower and lower. That&#39;s exactly how Gojo&#39;s Infinity technique. If an enemy launches an attack, the attack will become increasingly slower the closer it gets until it appears as if the attack has ended. In reality, it is so slow that it never hits Gojo. There are ways to counter this technique, but all in all, it&#39;s extremely powerful, and Gojo uses it defensively and offensively.



 Cursed Technique Amplification: Blue 
          

The second state of the Limitless is the amplified version, simply called Blue. Cursed energy is negative, and can be symbolized using the number -1. Once the cursed energy is amplified, the negative decreases further. This amplified cursed energy has some sort of hole which can pull in all surrounding objects and people into that hole to correct it, much like a black hole or magnet. He has used this ability brilliantly in the past, like when he cleared out buildings and objects in his fight against Toji earlier in Season 2 so that he wouldn&#39;t suffer a surprise attack. Besides the Hidden Inventory arc, he rarely uses this ability as it doesn&#39;t pack the same punch as others.






 Cursed Technique Reversal: Red 
          

The third variation is the Technique Reversal: Red. This version is the complete opposite of Blue, but twice as powerful. This technique multiples the -1 state of cursed energy by another -1 to make the cursed energy &#43;1. Achieving this requires immense training and talent, and its implications are life-changing, as healing can be accelerated. Gojo&#39;s Red takes advantage of the &#43;1 cursed energy to repel anything it approaches, much like a positive atom repels another positive atom. Although Red is manifested in a small red orb, it is extremely destructive and fast. Since it is compressed that much, it becomes much more powerful.



 Hollow Purple 
          




A third ability Gojo possesses, which fuses both Red and Blue, is a unique power that many members of his clan don&#39;t even know about. Named Hollow Purple, it fuses the -1 state of Blue and the &#43;1 state of Red to create an imaginary state of 0. This is Gojo&#39;s most devastating attack, as anything it touches isn&#39;t just destroyed, but completely erased from reality. He used this technique to kill Toji, and its power left Hanami nearly dead in Season 1. It&#39;s also his fastest as it almost seems like the attack slows down time or is so fast that everything else is slow. Regardless, nobody has dodged it. Series creator Gege Akutami hasn&#39;t explained the technique in depth, so much of it is still a mystery.



 Six Eyes 
        Gojo&#39;s Six Eyes   

All these applications of the Limitless are only possible due to the Six Eyes. The eyes primarily serve as an infra-red camera, noticing even the slightest of changes in someone&#39;s cursed energy. This allows Gojo to decipher what technique or how much power will be used. The Six Eyes also lets Gojo control his cursed energy down its atomic level, ensuring it is used efficiently and also aids in the subconscious use of the Limitless barrier. This is why Gojo never runs out of cursed energy no matter what. It is safe to say that without the Six Eyes, he wouldn&#39;t be nearly as powerful as he is.






 Domain Expansion: Infinite Void 
          

The pinnacle of jujutsu techniques, the Domain Expansion traps an opponent inside a barrier and any attacks from the user of the Domain are guaranteed to hit its target – even Gojo&#39;s Limitless can&#39;t stop it. Gojo&#39;s Domain is called the Infinite Void and is one of the most refined and powerful. Once an opponent is inside the void, so much information is flooded into their brain that they&#39;re unable to move. He used it in his fight against Jogo, easily defeating him. Nanami Kento said that victory for Gojo is almost guaranteed if he uses his Infinite Void.

Besides these techniques, Gojo also has other abilities. As previously mentioned, he can heal himself using reversed curse energy, but he cannot restore a limb, or his head. The series has seen him teleport many times, and he can also teleport others. This is his most mysterious technique as virtually nothing is known about. He can also fly, has a superhuman body and is absolutely brilliant when it comes to tactics.




Gojo Satoru is so powerful that the creator of the series absolutely hates him, and has vocalized his dislike for the character. This is because progressing the story while accommodating Gojo&#39;s godly powers is very hard, and he has struggled to find worthy plots to challenge Gojo. Gojo is easily one of the strongest characters in anime, and it is this strength that has made him such a complicated man. His extreme ego and ever-changing mood makes it hard to pin down just who he truly is. One thing is for sure though, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Gojo Satoru is one of the most complex characters in anime.
