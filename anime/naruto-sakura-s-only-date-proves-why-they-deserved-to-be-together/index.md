## Literature Review

While Sakura finally ended up marrying Sasuke, fans believed sheâ€™d be better off with Naruto. But how would they get past their platonic connection?




From early on in the story, more than a few Naruto fans hoped that the future Hokage would end up with Sakura Haruno. However, despite teasing a possible relationship between the two on several occasions, the relationship was strictly platonic by the series&#39; end. A large part of their friendly disconnect is due to Sakura&#39;s over-the-top infatuation with Sasuke. But if Sakura were to ever decide that chasing after Sasuke just wasn&#39;t worth the rejection, is there anyone more suitable to &#34;fill in&#34; for him than Naruto?




Veteran Naruto anime director Hayato Date explores this question in his 2012 animated film Road To Ninja: Naruto the Movie. The film places Sakura and Naruto in an alternate universe known as &#34;Genjutsu World&#34;. They are sent there via an Infinite Tsukuyomi spell cast by Tobi when he spots the two on a &#34;date&#34; in the park. At first, the Genjutsu World does not seem much different from the primary universe.

          

However, the two young shinobi soon realize that this is not the Konoha village that they were born and raised in. The people look the same, but there are significant differences in their personalities, behaviors, and fates. The history of the village is also significantly different. In Genjutsu World, Naruto&#39;s parents are still alive, but Sakura&#39;s parents are dead. It was Sakura&#39;s parents rather than Naruto&#39;s father and mother, who sacrificed themselves to end the attack of the Nine-Tails beast over a decade ago. That is, she&#39;s the village orphan living at home alone, rather than Naruto.






Though series creator Masashi Kishimoto worked on it, Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie is not part of the official Naruto canon.





 Genjutsu World Gives Sakura A Chance To See The Real Naruto 

 

Sakura is initially quite happy in the new world. It is exactly the world she&#39;s wished for countless times in the primary timeline as she finds he parents overbearing. However, she soon realizes that it&#39;s the coldest and loneliest situation she&#39;s ever had to endure. This is because her experiences in the Genjutsu World are identical to those undergone by Naruto in the primary timeline. By seeing life from Naruto&#39;s perspective, Sakura begins to understand his pain. This helps her to realize just how special he is to both her and Sasuke as a friend and teammate.




Naruto and Sakura already share a number of experiences that historically have led to the development of a romantic relationship. They&#39;ve spent a lot of time together. They enjoy each other&#39;s company. They genuinely care for each other, and they&#39;ve shared the types of stressful experiences that tend to bind people together emotionally. However, this new experience would give Sakura a deeper level of understanding about Naruto that no one else would have. That is, it would create the perfect environment for true love to develop between them if, or whenever, she gets over Sasuke.



 Sakura&#39;s Experience In Genjutsu World Opens Up A Range Of Options 
          

Sakura comes into the Genjutsu World with her prior beliefs. She is still infatuated with Sasuke and views Naruto as a good friend - who sometimes annoys her - but there is no romantic interest. Accordingly, when she meets this world&#39;s Sasuke, she initially sees him as she does in the primary timeline - cold, aloof, and unemotional. However, she&#39;s surprised to find that this world&#39;s Sasuke is warm and friendly. He is the Sasuke she&#39;s dreamed about for years. Unfortunately, that warm feeling is extinguished when she learns Sasuke is friendly to everyone. It&#39;s the same problem as in the primary timeline - Sasuke is just not that into her.




This did not bother her in the primary timeline. She struggled until she got her man. But the difference now is her deeper understanding of Naruto. It gives her a shared experience she&#39;s never had with Sasuke and one that fans of the Naruto-Sakura romance prove they deserve to be together and belong together.
