Although it does seem that the second season is arriving fast, it is important to note that the first season had only 12 episodes and that this release date is the norm, even more so for anime as popular as this. Unfortunately, the release isn&#39;t specific, but more information and a main trailer should be released soon. Season 2 will most likely adapt the 2.5D Stage Play arc from the manga, which will pick up right where Season 1 left off with Aqua joining the Lala Lai Theatrical Company. In an attempt to gain more information on Ai&#39;s lover and suspected killer, Aqua joins the theater where the two first met.




Based on the manga written by Aka Akasaka and illustrated by Mengo Yokoyari, Oshi No Ko was an instant hit as it showed the harsh reality of the entertainment industry while also entertaining fans with the thriller aspect. Aqua and Ruby Hoshino have both been revived and born to Ai Hashino after their deaths. Their mother is an ultra-popular idol and is tragically murdered. Saddened and angered by her death, Aqua sets out to avenge her and find the culprit by infiltrating the entertainment industry to find who might have harbored a grudge against her.
