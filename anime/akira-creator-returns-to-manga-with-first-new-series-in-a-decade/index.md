## Literature Review

Katsushiro Otomo teased on social media that he is beginning work on a new manga, which will be the first new creation in over a decade.




Katsushiro Otomo, known best as the creator of the famous manga Akira, posted an image on his X account along with a caption that strongly implies he is writing a new story. Otomo&#39;s last manga came out in 2012, meaning that a new manga would mark the end of a near decade-long pause in his work. Details are scant, but anticipation is high for another work from the famed creator.




Otomo became a household name after Akira&#39;s animated adaptation took the world by storm in 1988. Afterwards, Otomo worked on a variety of smaller projects, before going quiet after 2012.


 

Thus, the idea that the writer might be creating a new long-running manga is cause for excitement, even if it might be a while before an official announcement occurs.

                  10 Reasons Akira&#39;s Live-Action Movie Is So Hard To Make   The live-action Akira movie has been in the works for over two decades. Here is why a live-action Akira remake is so difficult to make.   


 Otomo Promises a New Manga, But No Concrete Details Exist 
          




The post on Otomo&#39;s X account shows a whiteboard with a variety of doodles, most significantly a sketch of the Akira character Kiyoko who jokingly paraphrases a line from the movie: &#34;I had a dream that Otomo-sensei drew a new manga.&#34; The written caption accompanying the image says: &#34;Kiyokoâ€™s prophetic dream will become reality.&#34; This has led to much anticipation that the acclaimed writer may finally be returning to the industry after a protracted break. Akira, which was released in 1982, provided imagery that helped establish cyberpunk imagery going forward. The 1988 movie is also celebrated for its quality animation.



Fans of the Akira movie should read the manga, as it expands on many details and plot points found in the movie.




In the years since, Otomo has chiefly worked on a variety of one-shot manga, either providing art or writing for them. The last work he&#39;s received credit for is Kibun wa mo Senso 3 (Datta Kamo Shirenai), which came out in 2012. While it is exciting to hear from the writer again, there is some skepticism about whether this is truly a final confirmation that a new manga is in production: Otomo has for the last few years regularly claimed he is working on a new story, such as a supposed Meiji-era tale that he also mentioned last in 2012.




With naught but a caption about a whiteboard to go on, it&#39;s difficult to tell whether Otomo is indeed working on his earlier pitches, something new, or just saying a few words before disappearing again. Still, any chance at all of a new manga from him is a welcome one. With so many years since the release of the cyberpunk tale that made him famous, Otomo obviously won&#39;t feel beholden to audiences just to create any follow-up to it. For now, all that remains is to wait and see what sort of &#34;reality&#34; the Akira creator has in store.
