# How Jujutsu Kaisen s Geto Still Appears in the Anime After 0


## SUMMARY 



  Geto is still alive in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime because he is not actually Geto, but an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku who implants his brain into others&#39; bodies.   Kenjaku is the true antagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen and his goal is to fuse everyone in Japan into a massive cursed spirit.   Kenjaku is more powerful than Geto and possesses various abilities, including reversed curse energy, Domain Expansion, and the cursed techniques of his previous hosts.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen 0 seemingly contradicts the fate of one character in the anime, but there&#39;s a good reason for how and why they&#39;re still around.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Jujutsu Kaisen volumes 11 and 16-23.The Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie left one question that wouldn&#39;t be addressed until later: how is Geto still alive in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime? The movie heavily implied that Geto died in the end, yet the anime, which takes place a year after the movie, still featured him as an antagonist. There’s an explanation for why that is, although it only recently appeared in the Shibuya Incident arc of the anime.




At the end of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Gojo confronted a heavily wounded Geto with a clear intent to killing him for everything he&#39;d done, but the movie never actually showed Gojo killing him, so there’s a bit of ambiguity as to whether or not he truly died. The Jujutsu Kaisen anime, which takes place a year after the movie, has Geto as an antagonist, so at a glance, it would seem that Gojo spared Geto and let him escape because of their old friendship.

          

As for his injuries, it’s possible to use cursed energy to heal wounds and regrow limbs, so Geto could have found someone to do that for him, which could be why he looks the same in the anime, save for a scar across his head.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Where Is Yuta Okkotsu In The Show?   Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a prequel to the anime series, however, its protagonist Yuta Okkotsu has not been properly introduced in the series. Here&#39;s why.   





 Geto&#39;s True Identity In The Jujutsu Kaisen Anime Is The Story&#39;s True Villain 
          

None of that is the case, however, as the reason Geto is still around in Jujutsu Kaisen is that he&#39;s not Geto, but Kenjaku, an ancient sorcerer who’s survived into modern-day by implanting his brain into other people’s bodies, with Geto being his latest victim in the aftermath of Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Geto having his body taken over by someone was recently revealed in Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, although at the time of writing, the anime has only covered the basics of the situation.

Kenjaku is the true antagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen, with his goal being to fuse everyone in Japan into a massive cursed spirit just to see what happens. Kenjaku has been taking over people’s bodies for centuries to realize his goals, including the ancestral Noritoshi Kamo, with Kenjaku then using his body to create the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings. Not only that, but in the aftermath of the Shibuya arc, it’s revealed that Kenjaku once possessed the body of Yuji’s mother, possibly even giving birth to him, and it&#39;s heavily implied that Yuji&#39;s superhuman abilities were the result of Kenjaku wanting to create a perfect vessel for Sukuna, although Kenjaku lost interest in Yuji and Sukuna desired Megumi as a vessel.






 Kenjaku Is Much More Powerful Than Geto 
          

Something that makes Kenjaku such a dangerous villain in Jujutsu Kaisen is how much more powerful he is than Geto. In addition to possessing the same abilities as Geto, someone who was seen as being in the same league as Gojo, he can use reversed curse energy to heal himself and can even use Domain Expansion. Not only that, but Kenjaku can use the cursed techniques of his previous hosts, with one ability being his Antigravity System, which adds even more versatility to his arsenal. Add in his incredible physical abilities, and Kenjaku more than establishes himself as a powerful enemy more than deserving to be Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s central antagonist.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s True Villain Will Be Beaten By The Most Unexpected Hero   Kenjaku has been portrayed as something of an invincible villain in Jujutsu Kaisen, but chapter #239 sets him up to be defeated by an unexpected hero.   






 Why Kenjaku Had To Possess Geto In Jujutsu Kaisen 
          

There are many reasons why Kenjaku chose Geto specifically for a possession target. The most important reason, of course, is that Kenjaku needed Geto&#39;s Cursed Spirit Manipulation technique to take control of Mahito and Tengen and use their powers to increase the number of sorcerers in Japan and eventually fuse everyone into a singular cursed spirit. Not only that but by wearing the face of Gojo&#39;s best friend, he was able to put him in a state of shock that allowed for him to be sealed in the Prison Realm, something Kenjaku had to do as his plans would never have worked if Gojo was free to fight him.

Kenjaku serves as a great antagonistic foil for Geto. While Geto saw humanity as something that needed to be eliminated, Kenjaku sees it as something that should be preserved, if only for the sake of his own goals, and while Kenjaku doesn’t appear to have any compassion for anyone, Geto, despite his actions, does care about other people, deep down. All in all, Kenjaku&#39;s character serves to make Jujutsu Kaisen a vastly different story from Jujutsu Kaisen 0, and with the manga set to end soon, those differences are likely to become even more apparent in the upcoming months.
