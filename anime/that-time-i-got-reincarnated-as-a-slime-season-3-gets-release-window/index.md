The third season of the hit anime series That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime finally gets an official release window. After the success of the Scarlet Bond anime film, the official website of the series announces that Season 3 will make its broadcast debut in Japan in the spring of 2024.




Reincarnated As A Slime just registered a huge success in Japan with the release of its first movie, Scarlet Bond. Following the &#34;Grand Finale Screening&#34; of the film, the official site and social media channels of the series shared the list of events that will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise. As reported by Crunchyroll, one of the biggest news is that the third season of Reincarnated As A Slime, first announced back in November 2022, will begin broadcasting in Japan in the spring of 2024.


 Season 3 Of Reincarnated As A Slime Is Coming In Spring 2024 
          

That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is one of the most successful and influential series in the popular Isekai genre, which started as a light novel and spanned into a manga and anime franchise. In the story, Japanese corporate worker Mikami Satoru gets randomly stabbed in the street and dies, only to be reincarnated in a fantasy world. Satoru, however, is not reborn as a mighty warrior but as the lowest of monsters, a slime. Taking the name of Rimuru Tempest and through a mix of his human cunning and the natural abilities he is reborn with, the protagonist manages to become one of the most powerful monsters in the world, a Demon Lord, and build a prosperous kingdom called Tempest where monsters and other races can coexist in peace.




The Reincarnated As A Slime 10th anniversary initiatives will also include a brand new short story written by series&#39; creator Fuse, with a companion manga adaptation being done by Yuzo Takada, the author of the classic 3X3 Eyes series, that will be serialized in Monthly Shonen Sirius. A new three-part OVA, adapting the Coleus&#39; Dream side story, will be released in Fall 2023. A stage play adaptation has also been announced, and it will begin its performances in August 2023. Fans&#39; expectations are mostly focused on the third season of the anime, which, according to the teaser visual released, will focus on Rimuru&#39;s battle with Hinata Sakaguchi, one of the strongest opponents that Rimuru has yet to face after his ascension to the rank of Demon Lord, and it will likely adapt the seventh volume of the light novel series, titled Saint-Monster Confrontation.



 Where Season 2 of Reincarnated As A Slime Left Off 
          




Season 2 of That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime ended with Rimuru attending the meeting of the Demon Lords, known as Walpurgis, all while running into conflict with the Demon Lord Clayman, who had been after Rimuru for quite some time. Clayman tried to manipulate another Demon Lord, Milim, into fighting against Rimuru, but Milim&#39;s affection for Rimuru won out. Clayman managed to reach an even higher level of power through an awakening, and Clayman and Rimuru clashed directly until Rimuru finally came out on top.

The events of the Scarlet Bond film were an original story, not adapted from the light novels or manga, and thus it&#39;s hard to say what impact, if any, it will have on season 3. It&#39;s just as likely that the events of the film will be ignored as it is that the story will somehow be incorporated into the broader narrative. Any potential impact would likely have to do with Hiiro, due to his connection to the other Kijin survivors who live in Tempest, which could be a relatively minor adjustment to include.






 Reincarnated As A Slime&#39;s Season 3 Will Showcase Rimuru&#39;s Hardest Battle 
          

That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime opened the way for the success of the now-ubiquitous Isekai genre. Ten years later, the franchise keeps growing and shows no sign of stopping. With the recent release of Scarlet Bond, the upcoming celebrations for the franchise&#39;s 10th anniversary, and a third anime season officially in the making, there is no better time to be a fan of Rimuru and to follow his adventures in That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime.
