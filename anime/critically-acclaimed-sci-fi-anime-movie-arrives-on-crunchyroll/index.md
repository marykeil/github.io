## Literature Review

Psycho-Pass Providence, which came out in theaters earlier this year, will be making its way worldwide through Crunchyroll, filling in the timeline.




The 10-year anniversary movie of the Psycho-Pass franchise, Psycho-Pass Providence, has released the streaming service Crunchyroll. The movie has already received screenings in Japan in the US, but it will now be available online internationally. Providence is particularly important as it fills in the anime&#39;s timeline, of which Crunchyroll hosts all seasons.




Psycho-Pass is one of the most successful sci-fi noir series to come out of the anime industry in recent times. Even after a decade, a new movie was able to make waves internationally, which proves how popular and unique the franchise is after all this time. So it is no surprise that Crunchyroll would acquire it, both as a movie and as another notable part of the expanded worldbuilding.

Sony Pictures and Crunchyroll, which jointly held sneak peek screenings earlier in the year, provided a synopsis for the film:


January 2118. Chief Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department, Akane Tsunemori, receives a report of an incident on a foreign vessel – the body of Professor Milicia Stronskaya has been discovered. Behind the incident is a group known as the Peacebreakers, a foreign paramilitary organization and a new outside threat who are targeting the professor&#39;s research papers known as the “Stronskaya Document.” Reunited with Shinya Kogami, a former fugitive from the Criminal Investigation Department, Akane grapples with a case that quickly escalates beyond their expectations. The Stronskaya Papers could reveal a truth that would shake Japan&#39;s government, and even the Sibyl System, to the core. It is in this untold story that the missing link is revealed.





Besides being an anniversary celebration, Providence also serves as an interquel between seasons. After Season 2, the story is picked up in a trilogy of films, known collectively as Sinners of the System. In 2019, it was followed by a controversial third season. Providence slots between Sinners and Season 3, and brings the focus back on Akane and Shinya, the leads of Season 1 and all-around fan favorites.

As it turned out, despite her growth as a character, Season 3, for some reason, chose to lock Akane out of the plot by putting her in prison. The decision was more odd since Shinya was free to make appearances. The resulting negative fan response eventually led to Season 3&#39;s movie sequel, The First Inspector, assuring viewers she would return. Providence, in a roundabout way, makes good on that promise, and also shows the events that justified her incarceration. As such, the movie fills in the gaps in the timeline and makes the heroine&#39;s temporary disappearance easier to swallow.




          

The first season of Psycho-Pass aired in 2012, and is credited to renowned writer Gen Urobuchi. Like his other stories, the anime questions ideas like utilitarianism and &#34;common good&#34;, albeit with a sci-fi bent. The following seasons were handled by other writers, to mixed success. Crunchyroll currently hosts all three seasons, as well as The First Inspector. Notably, it does not have Sinners of the System. Providence, thankfully, seems to connect more to Season 3, so the loss in details - such as Shinya&#39;s activities between seasons - is unwelcome but minimal. Nonetheless, Crunchyroll&#39;s Psycho-Pass experience can only be improved with Providence.
