## Literature Review

New Trigun series, Trigun Stampede, has a conspicuous absence in its roster of characters: Milly Thompson. So what happened to Milly and where is she?




The new Trigun Stampede anime aired to critical acclaim, but the highly anticipated first seasons of Trigun&#39;s reboot had a lot of fans asking just one question: what happened to Milly Thompson? Milly Thompson is a character who appeared in the 1998 Trigun anime and the manga before it. In those works, Milly is a tall woman with a big gun who acts as Meryl Strife&#39;s partner at the Bernardelli Insurance Company.




Despite being partners and friends, Meryl and Milly are almost complete opposites in the original Trigun. Meryl is much more easily riled up while Milly keeps calm and cool in almost any situation, allowing them to balance each other out.

          

Meryl and Milly&#39;s dynamic formed the heart of the original Trigun anime, so when Milly was absent from Trigun Stampede&#39;s early trailers, many fans were worried.


 Trigun Stampede Cut Milly to Focus on Meryl 
         

In Trigun Stampede, Meryl has a new partner, a man named Roberto De Niro. Meryl is now the young rookie, and Roberto is her jaded, experienced, and hard-drinking partner. Their dynamic is hardly the same as Meryl and Milly&#39;s though, as Meryl always treated Milly with respect, whereas Roberto, while looking out for her safety, treats Meryl as little more than a fresh-faced newbie. Meryl and Roberto are also now said to be reporters, not insurance adjusters, and Meryl is hoping that an interview with Vash will help her hit the big time.




Trigun Stampede hasn&#39;t been afraid to make changes, though, as each character has already seen some major design alterations. It&#39;s fair for the studio to want to change things; after all, the original Trigun anime is seen as a classic in the West, so retreading the same ground wouldn&#39;t quite work. In Roberto&#39;s defense, the character works fine as a partner for Meryl, and the series isn&#39;t irreparably damaged due to Milly&#39;s absence. Even if it&#39;s working, though, it was simply baffling to fans that they&#39;d discard a key character so readily... or so it seemed.



 Trigun Stampede Confirms Milly&#39;s Return For Season 2 
          

Initially, Milly&#39;s absence was not commented upon by the production studio, Orange. However, as the show began airing in January 2023, it became apparent that Trigun Stampede was set earlier in the characters&#39; lives; the new character designs seen in Stampede are meant to make the characters look younger because they are literally younger.




Meryl is the rookie character now because Stampede intended to show exactly how she became experienced in the first place. This was eventually confirmed, as the events of the Trigun Stampede season finale involve an incident that occurs before the beginning of the Trigun Maximum manga. That does mean a major change was made to when characters met, but otherwise sets the series up to be a straighter manga adaptation from this point forward.

                  Trigun Stampede Season 2: Latest News, Story, Characters, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   A second season has been confirmed for the winter hit Trigun Stampede. Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s been revealed about the new season so far.   

The final episode of Trigun Stampede includes a one-year timeskip, and the Meryl seen after this year is much closer to the Meryl from the 1998 anime. She&#39;s in a car, speaking to her boss, who says that it&#39;s time she gets a new partner and that there&#39;s a young rookie who&#39;s asked to be matched with Meryl specifically; Milly Thompson. This shows that Milly will be added to Trigun Stampede in season 2. The first season of Trigun Stampede proved the series&#39; quality, so fans have every reason to look forward to seeing Milly next season.
