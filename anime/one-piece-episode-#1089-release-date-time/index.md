## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1089 will start the new Egghead Island arc, which many manga readers regard as one of the series&#39; best recent storylines.




After one last episode of setup, One Piece is going on a brief hiatus before episode #1089. That episode will herald the beginning of the new and exciting Egghead Island arc, which manga readers have been hyping up for some time. If it lives up to the hype then it will be well worth the wait.

 What Happened in Episode #1088 of One Piece? 
          

Episode #1088 resolved the cliffhanger of the previous installment in a satisfying way, bringing back an iconic old character. Blackbeard had held Boa at his mercy but then Silvers Raleigh, the right-hand man of the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, appeared and rescued the former warlord and her Amazons from the imposing Yonko and the marines. However, in the midst of this, Blackbeard apparently kidnapped Koby, leaving the young marine in a dangerous situation. Back on the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats learned that Sabo had been accused of killing King Cobra at the Reverie and that Vivi was missing. They ultimately decided not to act on that information, trusting Sabo and Vivi. Luffy ended the episode by revealing his true dream to his crew, although viewers unfortunately didn&#39;t get to hear it.






 One Piece Episode #1089 Will Begin the Egghead Island Arc 
          

The title of episode #1089 may not be revealed yet but fans still know a bit about the arc it will introduce. The trailer for the Egghead Island arc showed off a futuristic location complete with giant robots and sci-fi outfits. It also heavily featured Vegapunk&#39;s name, implying that fans may finally get to meet the World Government&#39;s top scientist. It also hinted at information relating to the Void century, meaning Egghead Island may be very important from a lore perspective as well. Altogether, this hints that Egghead Island may be as important to the series as Wano, but will have a refreshingly different tone compared to the previous arc.

This change of pace is good as while Wano was an excellent arc, it was also very long. Given One Piece is a series about exploration, it will be nice to see the Straw Hats in a brand new location that is different from what came before it. Fans wonâ€™t want to miss the beginning of the Egghead Island arc when One Piece episode #1089 airs on Crunchyroll on January 6.
