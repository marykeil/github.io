## Literature Review

Hulu&#39;s growing catalog of anime features a wide variety of fantasy series – from traditional high fantasy to isekai – for fans to sink their teeth in.




The best fantasy anime on Hulu include series from a wide variety of subgenres, but they all share an innate ability to incorporate magic into their narratives and build a world of colorful creatures and phenomena on the opposite spectrum from realism. Hulu boasts a rather extensive listing of anime, leaving many wonderful fantasy series to choose from.
To narrow down a genre as broad as fantasy, the distinction should be made between pure fantasy and imaginative fiction. Although series such as Hunter x Hunter can be considered a fantasy, the types of powers involved are more akin to the supernatural than to magic. Furthermore, a fantasy should involve worldbuilding that tickles the senses while still not straying too far from fantasy archetypes. As a result, anime such as Dragon Ball and Bleach will not be considered, especially with battle-oriented storytelling. On the other hand, series from the isekai genre fit in perfectly.

 7  Black Clover Is a Journey Towards Magical Supremacy 
Based on the manga by Tabata Yuuki


 







The premise of Black Clover is as close to high fantasy as it can get, as the anime follows a young boy who dreams of becoming the wizard king named Asta. Although the series is both shonen and battle-focused, its inclusion among other fantasy anime is due to its main mode of power being a traditional magic system. Black Clover is an endearing display of perseverance, as Asta possesses no magical power. Instead, he trains in his physicality, and through a hint of luck, Asta is admitted into the Black Bulls of the kingdom&#39;s Magic Knights, thus beginning his slow climb towards the peak of the magic world.

 6  That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Has Peak Worldbuilding 
Based on the manga by Kawakami Taiki and Fuse
        

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is a fantasy anime that immediately became a hit isekai classic through its seemingly contradictory premise. Mikami Satoru, an average Japanese corporate man, is reborn as a slime, a creature considered the bottom of the fantastical totem pole. However, the anime utilizes such a weakness to introduce a system and create an enthralling way of gaining power: devour. Thus, the slime, renamed as Rimuru, enters the world with curiosity and hope of finding new friends, eventually leaving his own mark on the fantasy world through village construction and later country construction, all the while existing parallel to the human camp.

 4  Log Horizon Does the Isekai Game Right 
Based on the light novel by Touno Mamare and Hana Kazuhiro
        

The premise of Log Horizon may sound similar in the realm of fantasy anime, as its characters are trapped within a video game. Despite being part of an overused isekai trope, Log Horizon is one of the earliest to do it, and one that does it right. The protagonist, Shiroe, is complex and level-headed, and despite the strength that he retains from previously playing Elder Tale, he finds time to make meaningful connections and help beginners. Instead of struggling to escape the game world and agonizing over their fate, the characters in Log Horizon are able to control their own fate, constructing towns, guilds, and even an entire political sphere.
