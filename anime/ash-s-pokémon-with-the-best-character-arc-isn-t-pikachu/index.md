## Literature Review

A certain Pokémon that Ash encountered in the Kalos region had a tragic backstory which it had to learn to overcome, giving it a nice character arc.




Many of Ash&#39;s Pokémon in the Pokémon anime have had some interesting character arcs over the years, but Ash&#39;s Goomy stands out as having one of the best arcs in the series, even topping the likes of Pikachu. By dealing with difficult issues and overcoming them to be a real hero, Goomy&#39;s growth becomes a model for young viewers.




Ash first encounters Goomy in the episode &#34;A Slippery Encounter&#34; of Pokémon XY, where it literally falls out of the sky and lands on Ash&#39;s head. Goomy is shown to be terrified of Dedenne, a Fairy-type Pokémon belonging to one of Ash&#39;s companions, and eventually it&#39;s revealed that Goomy once lived in the wetlands nearby, which were attacked one day by a horde of Bug-type Pokémon being led by the Fairy-type Florges.

          

Goomy and its wetland friends were easily defeated, and the Bug-types overtook Goomy&#39;s home. Goomy is weak and fearful as a result of this traumatic experience, afraid to even attempt to battle.

Goomy is shown to have PTSD-like flashbacks to the event, which cause it to freeze up and fail to act in battle. Ash helps Goomy to overcome this and keep its mind focused on the moment. Despite being constantly put down as &#34;the weakest Dragon-type,&#34; Ash sticks with Goomy and helps it to grow. Dedenne also goes out of its way to rescue Goomy when it gets into trouble after fleeing, which allows Goomy to realize that not all Fairy-types are going to to hurt it. As Goomy becomes more confident in its abilities, it evolves into a Sliggoo, and then into a Goodra, which easily becomes one of Ash&#39;s strongest Pokémon.

In the two-part episodes &#34;Defending the Homeland&#34; and &#34;Beyond the Rainbow,&#34; Goodra returns to its wetlands home, but despite its growth, it is still unnerved at the thought of being there. While it&#39;s happy to see its friends again, the area itself is still under the control of Florges and the Bug-types. While Ash is discouraged from intervening in a territory dispute between wild Pokémon, he allows Goodra to take a stand, using its newfound power to retake their home. During the course of the struggle, it&#39;s revealed that Florges only attacked the wetlands in order to gain access to special healing water for a sick Floette.




Goodra is able to set aside its previous resentment and work together with Florges to get rid of Team Rocket, and Goodra&#39;s Rain Dance causes water to pour in, refilling the special healing pool after Team Rocket drained it. Ash, having seen how far Goodra has come, decides to part ways with it, leaving the now fully-evolved Goodra to act as a protector of its home. Goomy receives a complete character arc throughout its relatively brief stay in the anime (and would eventually rejoin Ash), all while dealing with difficult topics that kids watching the show may be facing in their real lives. Goomy&#39;s arc is exceptionally well handled, and serves as proof that the Pokémon anime actually can have some great writing.

Pokémon XY: Kalos Quest is available on Hulu.
