## Literature Review

My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer might have a title that implies it will be formulaic, but that couldn&#39;t be more wrong.




Warning: Spoilers for My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer episode #8With a title like My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer, viewers are bound to think that this fantasy anime from Crunchyroll is either some sort of isekai or a highly formulaic, gimmicky series. However, this series is actually quite mature, and even though there are classes and quest guilds like in many RPG anime, the similarities end there.






This light novel series by writer Mojikakiya and illustrator toi8 is literally translated as My Daughter Who Wanted to Be an Adventurer and Went to the Capital Is Already an S-Rank.




As the name of te series implies, there&#39;s a daughter named Angeline who leaves her father, Belgrieve, to become an adventurer and eventually returns home as a massive success. The first episodes also create the impression that the anime does indeed have a gimmick and that the title is apparently referencing the series finale because Angeline continually tries and fails to get back to her eponymous nest. This anime, however, is clearly about subverting first impressions.

          

Ironically, the literal translation of the original light novel series&#39; title by writer Mojikakiya and illustrator toi8 is even more ridiculous than the official anime name: &#34;My Daughter Who Wanted to Be an Adventurer and Went to the Capital Is Already an S-Rank.&#34;





 My Daughter Left the Nest Explores How A New Evil Affects Two Worlds Differently 
          

The series masterfully explores the differing dynamics between how a new evil affects an S-ranked adventurer on the front lines and how it affects someone who lives a slow-paced life in the countryside. Although the two of them go on a multi-episode-long quest during the daughter&#39;s brief visit, it&#39;s stunning how Angeline&#39;s adventuring changes Belgrieve&#39;s life even when they&#39;re apart.

Before her eventual return, Belgrieve&#39;s life is quite normal, so the majority of the episodes revolve around Angeline&#39;s adventures. Interestingly, Belgrieve&#39;s life changes dramatically even before Angeline&#39;s arrival. Just her mere presence in the general vicinity before she&#39;s forced to leave has a dramatic impact on Belgrieve that persists long after she&#39;s gone. Angeline&#39;s love for her father coupled with her own legacy thrust Belgrieve into a new society which sparks their adventure together once she returns home. Upon her eventual departure, the spreading evil naturally comes home to her father and is powerful enough to change everything regardless of what she does, serving as a unique way to underscore just how out of hand things are getting.






 My Daughter Left the Nest Explores a Complex Relationship 
          

Apart from the beautiful scenery, other aspects stand out about this greatly prejudged series. My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer showcases the duality of Belgrieve&#39;s pride for his daughter as a father and for himself as a man with an unfortunate past. Despite this dynamic, Belgrieve&#39;s situation is more nuanced than initial appearances suggest. He tries to avoid any situation that either requires him to prove himself or that could garner him extra attention.

Although driven by how both worlds are differently impacted by a new evil, Crunchyroll&#39;s My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer is really a story about the love between a father and daughter, which, no matter how much life might keep them apart, will always connect them.
