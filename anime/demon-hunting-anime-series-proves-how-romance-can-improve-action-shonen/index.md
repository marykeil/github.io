## Literature Review

Engage Kiss might be about demon hunting, but what truly captivates viewers is the romance and how well the anime depicts it.




The romantic elements of the demon-hunting anime Engage Kiss streaming on Crunchyroll prove that the action shonen genre can only benefit from the addition of romance. After the first two episodes present a classic action setup, the third episode completely transforms Engage Kiss into a series that&#39;s more than just about hunting terrifying demons with some cute rom-com scenarios.




In the beginning, viewers aren&#39;t even sure what line of work protagonist Shu Ogata is in, let alone anything that has to remotely do with demons. All that&#39;s known is that he hasn&#39;t been doing much of anything as of late, which is why he&#39;s living in destitution. However, once he starts shooting at demons after winning a job &#34;auction&#34; with other demon hunters, that&#39;s all viewers can understandably think about.

          

The next few episodes devote a considerable amount of time and energy to exploring the politics of Shu&#39;s solo demon-hunting company in relation to the competition and the question of demon rights, which is somehow connected to Shu&#39;s past, which is, of course, full of mystery.

Produced by A-1 Pictures and written by Fumiaki Maruto, with character designs by Tsunako.
          




With such a setup, it might be surprising that the tone completely shifts at the end of episode #3 of Engage Kiss to explore the dark relationship between Shu, his demon partner and girlfriend Kisara, and human friend Ayano Yugiri. Previous episodes had established that by Shu kissing Kisara, her true powers would be unlocked, allowing them to obliterate demons. It was also clear that Shu and Ayano had some type of history, since she would go out of her way to help Shu and because Kisara was clearly jealous of Ayano. Then, the third episode revealed that Ayano is Shu&#39;s first girlfriend, whom he still loves, and that he only kisses Kisara so that she can have the power to destroy and therefore protect Ayano from demons. Moreover, the more he and Kisara perform this inappropriate contract (while Kisara is technically 100 years old, she looks like an underaged girl, a common and controversial trope in anime) the more Shu forgets about his relationship with Ayano.

It&#39;s obvious how much weight Engage Kiss puts on this twisted love triangle just by how forcefully it reveals the truth. Despite how much more time the anime had already devoted to the action aspect of the series, Engage Kiss clearly prioritizes the romantic drama to help illustrate the true tragedy of the protagonists&#39; predicament. Although there&#39;s clearly more to the story, what specifically stands out is that, irrespective of the fact that the whole scenario is completely outlandish, it&#39;s essentially a story about how people will put themselves through hell to protect the ones they love, even if it means being in a loveless relationship and breaking their loved one&#39;s heart in the process.






Engage Kiss is part of a mixed-media project called Project Engage created by Aniplex, including a manga series, an anime television series, and an action RPG mobile game developed by Square Enix, called Engage Kill.




          

Outside the romance aspect of the series, there are many other action shonen that have followed exactly what the majority of Engage Kiss&#39; earlier episodes revolved around and succeeded as a result. Engage Kiss could have easily relegated all its romance to the eponymous kiss that Shu and Kisara have to share to power up and still be as successful. However, seeing how much Engage Kiss improved after its drastic shift proves how these and other action shonen that don&#39;t incorporate or depend on romance could be so much better if they did.
