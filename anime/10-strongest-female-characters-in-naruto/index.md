## Literature Review

Contrary to popular belief, Naruto did have its share of powerful women who often played key, albeit less publicized roles, in the story.





Whether from an inherited kekkei genkai passed down through the generations, a special technique learned after hours of arduous training regimen, or some combination of both, Naruto features more than a few female characters with remarkable powers and exceptional fighting techniques. Below is a list of the strongest female characters in the story, based on their abilities to win a fight against an opponent on any given day.









 








 12  Konan 
        

Konan doesn’t get much attention due to being overshadowed most of the time by the other members of Akatsuki. Nevertheless, her skills are top-level. She cut her teeth as a shinobi under the tutelage of the legendary ninja Jiraiya. She deepened her abilities as an outlaw with the revolutionary ninja organization Akatsuki. She single-handedly almost killed Obito, who only escaped death by running away. Her unique - and deadly - technique was one she developed on her own. Known as &#34;paper ninjutsu&#34; it allows her to transform her chakra into paper and become anything paper could from a paper clone of herself to wrapping an opponent up to suffocate them.





 11  Kurenai Yuhi 
        

While Yuhi is fondly remembered as either Hinata Hyuga&#39;s mentor, Team Eight’s teacher supervisor, or Asuma Sarutobi’s love interest, there was much more to her than her work and personal life. Indeed, the fact that she was able to reach the Jonin level of mastery proves her skills. One of her first assignments as a Jonin was to take down Itachi Uchiha, proving she was a first-class shinobi as well. Kurenai’s jutsu of choice is genjutsu or the art of illusion. As revealed in the Naruto sequel Konoha Shinden: Stream Ninja Scrolls, she has become so proficient at genjutsu few others can match her abilities.





 10  Temari Nara 
        

The fact that Sakura and Hinata got more attention than other female members of Naruto&#39;s cohort of shinobi does not mean that there were no others as gifted as them. In fact, in the case of Temari, she was clearly their equal, and in some aspects far superior to them. Indeed, as the daughter of the Hidden Sand village&#39;s Kazekage, Temari developed a very clear-eyed understanding of the world very young. As a result, she wasn&#39;t afraid of anything or anyone, except perhaps her brother Gaara. That attitude helped her achieve the level of Jonin much quicker than most other shinobi of a similar age. Temari&#39;s strength is created through the combination of her Wind Release technique and her giant iron fan. When used in tandem, Temari is able to create gusts of wind that can flatten houses or blow opponents away.





 9  Hinata Hyuga 
        

Often being portrayed as the “damsel in distress” in need of saving, Hinata is still one of the best female ninja in Naruto. While she does often defer to others, no one should mistake her shyness for weakness. Hinata&#39;s strength arises from the power of her clan, the Byakugan – one of the three &#34;Great Dojutsu&#34; that puts them at the front of the line for talent. Hinata’s experience of being shunned by her clan also led her to develop an amazing resilience and determination that powered her to prove she&#39;s the best member of her clan. Accordingly, with the combination of her Byakugan, and her training in the clan&#39;s Gentle Fist technique, she&#39;s able to hit opponents close by or remotely with chakra-draining strikes that can simultaneously hurt, weaken, and incapacitate.





 8  Tsume Inuzuka 
        

Although Tsume might be better known as Hana and Kiba&#39;s mother, the fact that she&#39;s reached the level of Jonin speaks to her strength, power, and abilities. Indeed, according to her son Kiba, she&#39;s so hardcore that she literally scared his father into running away from their home - permanently. Tsume&#39;s special ability is her clan&#39;s Four Leg Technique which mimics the way dogs and wolves hunt and attack their prey. She is one of the most proficient users of the technique in her clan. Her abilities are enhanced by the fact that she often uses them in collaboration with her Ninken, Kuromaru. Ninken are specially trained dogs that are partnered with Inuzuka Clan members from childhood, and eventually become their fighting partners in battle.





 7  Sakura Haruno 
        

Sakura might not have started out as one of the strongest females in the Narutoverse, but, like Hinata, through sheer determination and an uncanny ability to focus on her studies, she eventually upgraded her abilities and strengthened her mindset. Accordingly, Sakura’s strength has three elements. First, she has otherworldly control of her chakra, which allows her to master the techniques of her mentor Tsunade, including increasing the power of her strikes or mastering the &#34;Strength of a Hundred&#34; seal. Second, Sakura&#39;s deep understanding of medical ninjutsu not only allows her to know where to heal - but also to harm with deadly efficiency. Third, there’s her intelligence. What Sakura lacks in innate abilities, she makes up for by outthinking her opponents.





 6  Anko Mitarashi 
        

While Anko is often referred to as one of Orochimaru&#39;s experiments, she was exceptionally gifted and powerful before she became his disciple. In fact, her innate abilities were what attracted Orochimaru to her in the first place. As a member of his team at the Ninja Academy, Anko stood out as the best member. However, under Orochimaru&#39;s guidance, Anko&#39;s skill level increased dramatically. He even taught her some of his signature techniques such as his Hidden Shadow Snake Hands. After leaving Orochimaru&#39;s tutelage, Anko continued deepening and expanding her abilities. Ultimately, Anko&#39;s abilities were recognized so much that she was classified as legendary after the Fourth Shinobi War&#39;s conclusion, and awarded the prestigious position of Tokubetsu Jonin.





 5  Lady Chiyo 
        

There is something to be said about your abilities when you are summoned from the afterlife because of your powerful techniques. During the Fourth Shinobi War, Chiyo was one of several deceased shinobi of exceptional skill who were resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi to assist him in his efforts to help Pain. Before her death, Chiyo served as the top expert of medical ninjutsu in the Hidden Sand village. She used her skill in this field to concoct poisons that were near perfect in their effectiveness. Indeed, the only person capable of counteracting their effect was Tsunade. Chiyo was also a master of Puppet Ninjutsu or the art of creating and controlling puppets who all had advanced training and advanced fighting skills of a top-level shinobi. And if her puppets were not enough, Chiyo also had the power to take control of up to 10 humans to do her bidding.





 4  Kurotsuchi 
        

If there’s anyone who was fated to be a major power in Naruto, it’s Kurotsuchi. As the descendant of her village&#39;s first Tsuchikage, Kurotsuchi&#39;s abilities spring from her genetics and make her one of the strongest shinobi of the five Hidden Villages. As a young shinobi during the Fourth Shinobi War, she single-handedly took out scores of Zetsu. Unlike others on the list, there is not one special technique that defines Kurotsuchi&#39;s strength. Instead, it&#39;s her high functionality in a range of abilities from nature transformations to kenjutsu to taijutsu that make her special. She&#39;s the best all-around shinobi in the group.





 3  Mei Terumi 
        

If the fact that she was the Mizukage, or leader of Hidden Mist Village, isn’t enough proof of Mei’s prowess, there’s also the fact that she played a pivotal role during the Fourth Shinobi War, fighting against Madara and facing the attacks of the strongest shinobi in history. Outside of her taijutsu skills, Mei possesses two innate abilities, or kekke genkai, that are extremely hard for opponents to overcome. With Lava Release, Mei can spit out a stream of highly acidic lava-like liquid that will burn through or melt down anything - including skin - it comes in contact with. Mei can also use Boil Release to spit out a corrosive mist that will also melt anything that comes in contact with it.





 2  Tsunade 
        

Tsunade&#39;s name is synonymous with power and strength. As a young woman, Tsunade was one of the “Sannin”, the legendary shinobi trio that is largely considered to be the greatest shinobi team in history. Tsunade can use her chakra to reach superhuman levels of strength, making her a huge threat in combat. Tsunade was instrumental in the development of medical ninjutsu, or the ability to use one’s chakra energy to heal others, essentially changing the history of the shinobi world. In a fight, Tsunade can activate her Strength of a Hundred seal to draw on a massive reserve of chakra she accumulated during the years which, along with her summon partner Katsuyu, results in a mass heal effect that benefits all her allies.





 1  Kaguya Otsutsuki 
        

The Narutoverse would not exist without Kaguya, as she is literally the mother of chakra in humanity. Originally, no one could stop her except maybe a true Otsutsuki God. For thousands of years, she lived without an equal on Earth. Ultimately, it took both her sons to defeat and seal her, but that was only a temporary victory. She returned centuries later and was just as powerful. Again, only the reincarnations of her grandsons could stop them, and only thanks to the chakra and powers they borrowed from the spirit of the Sage of the Six Paths. Despite being controversial for her sudden reveal at the end of the series, Kaguya remains the strongest female character in Naruto.
While Naruto may not highlight or emphasize female characters often, the women on this list show that when creator Masashi Kishimoto wanted, or needed to, he could create strong female characters that were interesting, intelligent, and just as capable as their male counterparts and colleagues.
