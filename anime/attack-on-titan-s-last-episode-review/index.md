## Literature Review

The last episode of Attack On Titan surpassed everyone&#39;s expectation and there is a lot to say about it.




The long-awaited finale of Attack On Titan is here, and it managed to take over social media and crash Crunchyroll servers like few other anime did before. The anticipation for the ending of what is considered one of the most popular anime of all time was incredible, especially considering the long wait that fans had to endure for it. An amazing ten-year run for the series has come to an end, and the final episode did right by the show.




The hour-long episode featured some of the best action in the whole series and brought together characters who were once enemies in an epic fight against a mutual enemy. From brutal deaths to shocking plot twists, the final episode of Attack On Titan was a great end to a series that will be forever missed.

                  Attack on Titan Ending Explained   After running for a decade, Attack on Titan&#39;s anime finally comes to an end, and here&#39;s everything about the ending explained in full detail.   


 Attack On Titan&#39;s Ending Was Well Received Despite Its Criticism 
         

The final chapter of the manga received a lot of hate when it was released in 2021. Most of the criticism was directed towards Eren and his behavior during his final moments, especially when he confessed his feelings for Mikasa after almost destroying the world. This came as a shock to the readers as Eren&#39;s character came out as pathetic at the very last moment. On the other hand, anime-only fans appreciated that Eren was honest about his feelings for Mikasa after suppressing them for so long. The entire crusade against humanity was just a way to make his friends the heroes for killing him, so being transparent before his death made Eren a more profound character.




Another major source of criticism was that, in his final conversation with Eren, Armin seemed to accept and even justify the actions of his friend, despite the fact that he murdered 80 percent of humanity. This conversation was however extended in the anime, making Eren and Armin&#39;s final moments a lot better than in the manga, and making sure that Eren&#39;s actions are not justified in any way.



 Attack On Titan&#39;s Finale Wrapped Up The Series Perfectly 
          

Every main Attack on Titan character got the satisfying ending they deserved. Eren got what he wanted, even if his twisted plan was misguided, Levi finally retired after years of fighting, Ymir was freed from her two-thousand-year-long curse, and Mikasa returned to her childhood home. Armin and the other members of the Scouts became peace envoys and managed to bring about the end of hostilities between Paradis Island and the outside world. However, the show also proved to be grounded in reality by showing that, even after all that, the cycle of hate and violence would never end, and war would resume in the future. Although there were plenty of happy endings, the show made it clear that these issues would always plague the world.




For these reasons, Attack On Titan managed to deliver a finale that was both satisfying and thought-provoking. This was mostly because these final episodes faithfully adapted the original story and incredible writing from Hajime Isayama. The characters had to face their biggest battle yet: from the impossible task of facing hundreds of Titans to the mental toll of having to kill their friend, the fight to save humanity stood out in the action-packed show at its best. As epic as the fight was, everyone got a fitting ending - whether good or bad. A lot of questions were also answered, mainly Ymir&#39;s reason for her undying loyalty to the Fritz Family.



 Former Staff Reunited For Attack On Titan&#39;s Unforgettable Finale 

 

For the final episode of Attack on Titan, Mappa made sure to bring back the team that helped make the series so special and popular. Linked Horizon, who created the opening songs for the first three seasons and the iconic &#34;Shinzo Wa Sasageyo&#34;, performed the opening song much to the delight of the anime community. The legendary animator Arifumi Imai, who was responsible for the iconic Levy vs Beast Titan fight and Levi&#39;s chase scene, was brought on board to animate Levi&#39;s final fight against Eren, alongside Mikasa. Mappa went above and beyond to ensure that the finale captured the true essence of Attack on Titan. It was beyond refreshing to see the people who were there from the beginning were also there to witness the end.




The final episode of Attack On Titan was a fitting end to a masterpiece and one of the best anime finales in recent years. It had everything fans dreamed of - from shocking plot twists and amazing character conclusions to flawless production. Isayama&#39;s additions to the source material made it even better, and fans can rest easy knowing that no resource was spared in the making of this episode. Attack On Titan will continue to live on in the hearts of millions, years after its conclusion, and will stand out as an example of an anime that both did justice to its source material and managed to surpass it in some ways.
