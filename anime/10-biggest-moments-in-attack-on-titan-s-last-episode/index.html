<p>Attack on Titan&rsquo;s Last Episode Review
The last episode of Attack On Titan surpassed everyone&rsquo;s expectation and there is a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>10  Porco And Annie&rsquo;s Appearance
14:08</p>
<p>The Global Alliance was facing their toughest foes yet - the previous wielders of the Titans that had existed for over 2000 years. It appeared that the Titans were endless, and despite the Global Alliance&rsquo;s best efforts, the Titans overwhelmed them. Just when it seemed like the end was near, Porco and Annie arrived and saved them from certain death. Moreover, Porco&rsquo;s Jaw Titan form could fly, allowing them to reach their destination much faster. This was possible due to Porco having some of Zeke&rsquo;s spinal fluid inside his body, which gave his Titan the rare ability to grow wings. This was particularly unusual for the Jaw Titan, which relied more on its agility on land than other Titans.</p>
<p>9  Zeke&rsquo;s Surrender
38:40</p>
<p>It seemed like every time Zeke was close to being captured, he&rsquo;d always find a way to escape. He escaped Levi twice, which is unheard of, let alone two times. However, this time Zeke was not in the mood to resist. After everything he&rsquo;d been through, he was completely opposed to the eradication of humanity outside Paradis and was broken by the revelation that his father was not the bad guy Zeke always thought of him as. In a last attempt to atone for his sins, he called out for Levi to kill him so that the Rumbling would stop, to which Levi happily obliged.</p>
<p>8  Former Wielders Join The Fight
05:09</p>
<p>At the onset of the battle, it was expected that Eren would utilize the Titans he had gained so far, like the Beast Titan and the War Hammer Titan. However, against the Global Alliance consisting of Levi and Mikasa, this didn&rsquo;t seem like much of a challenge as they had defeated stronger foes before. In a twist befitting a battle for the fate of the world, Eren summoned all the previous holders of the Titans, including Bertholdt, Galliard, and more. The chances of victory became almost impossible, as thousands of Titans stood before a mere four humans and two Titan wielders, one of them not even being suited for combat.</p>
<p>7  The Wielders Resist Eren
36:45</p>
<p>The Global Alliance was saved thanks to Zeke and Levi, who managed to convince some of the Titans to join their side. Among those who joined were Grisha Yeager, Berthold, and Galliard, who knew the members of the Alliance. With renewed hope, the Alliance launched an attack on Eren&rsquo;s nape in an attempt to force him out of the Titan body. If Zeke had not intervened and changed the tide of the battle in favor of the Alliance, it would have been the end for humanity outside the walls.</p>
<p>6  The Cycle Of Hate Is Repeated
1:23:07</p>
<p>In the episode&rsquo;s conclusion, things seemed to have ended on a peaceful and wholesome note. However, during the credit scene, it was revealed that war was going to happen again. This scene highlights the harsh reality that war is inevitable and will always exist as long as humans live. Despite Eren&rsquo;s plan working and successfully preventing war for a while, it only took time for tensions to rise again between Paradis and the outside world. It&rsquo;s a clear indication that peace can be temporary, and the threat of war always looms over humanity, no matter how hard we try to avoid it.</p>
<p>5  Levi&rsquo;s Retirement
1:18:59</p>
<p>After giving his all in the fight to save humanity, Levi lost the ability to walk, lost an eye, and gained other permanent scars. Known as humanity&rsquo;s strongest soldier, his contributions to the effort of reclaiming Paradis from the Titans cannot be overstated. His ending was by far the best in the series, as he finally got to rest after years of fighting and violence. Dedicating his time to becoming a volunteer, we can see him distributing sweets to children. Fans of the character will be pleased to hear that Levi will be the protagonist of the upcoming Attack On Titan chapter.</p>
<p>Attack On Titan Fans Get First Look At Upcoming New Manga
The plot of the mysterious follow-up chapter to Attack On Titan has been leaked, and it will revolve around Levi.</p>
<p>4  Ymir&rsquo;s Feelings
1:14:25</p>
<p>It was always a mystery as to why Ymir was obedient and loyal to King Fritz, the man who killed her family, cut off her tongue, and took away everything she loved. Furthermore, she also complied with the orders of his descendants. At the very end, Mikasa finally understands that revealed that Ymir did all this out of misguided love. Although she was one of the few deaths in Attack On Titan&rsquo;s final episode, she deserved to rest after living for 2000 years with basically no free will.</p>
<p>3  Eren&rsquo;s Confession
1:02:05</p>
<p>By far the most controversial moment in Attack on Titan, Eren finally confessed his true feelings for Mikasa. Throughout the show, it seemed like Mikasa&rsquo;s infatuation with Eren was one-sided, but that couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the truth. After some provoking from Armin, Eren became transparent about his love for Mikasa and how he wanted to live and be with her. Eren seemed a former shell of himself for the better part of the show, so his being honest was refreshing and served to only boost his image among fans, even after all he did.</p>
<p>2  Eren&rsquo;s True Objective
1:03:27</p>
<p>It was assumed that Eren wanted the complete annihilation of humanity outside the walls to ensure Paradis would never be attacked again. Although despicable, his plan could have worked. At the end of the episode, Eren tells Armin that his real plan was to force the Global Alliance, which consisted of soldiers from Paradis, to kill him, therefore gaining gratitude from humanity and leaving the people of Paradis as global heroes. Although this plot did work, Armin was nonetheless disgusted by how many people had to die for Paradis&rsquo; survival.</p>
<p>1  Eren&rsquo;s Death
55:10</p>
<p>The most shocking moment of Attack On Titan&rsquo;s final episode is Eren&rsquo;s death. It&rsquo;s not every day the main character of a series dies, but this was very fitting for the genocidal protagonist. What made his death even more shocking was that Mikasa - his childhood friend and the woman he loved - delivered the killing blow. Although it all went according to his plan, he still didn&rsquo;t want to die, which made his death even more heartbreaking. With one of the best character developments in anime, Eren will become one of the most beloved main characters of all time despite his evil actions.
It was heartbreaking to know that there would be no more Attack On Titan episodes, but the finale made fans forget all about this as it was just so entertaining. Everything about the episode was done right, and the plot twists and revelations were among the best in the show. The biggest moments in Attack On Titan&rsquo;s last episode were wild and shocking, leaving fans even more depressed upon realizing that this would be the end.
