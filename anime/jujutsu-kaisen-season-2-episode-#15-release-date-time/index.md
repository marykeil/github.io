## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #15 will likely follow up on the previous episode&#39;s cliffhanger and show once again what Toji Fushiguro can do.




After the shocking cliffhanger ending of episode #14, Jujutsu Kaisen fans are eagerly awaiting Season 2 episode #15 to see what will happen to the various fighters now that a new character has entered the fray. This is just one of the many dangling plot threads that are making the current part of the Shibuya Incident arc so compelling. If episode #15 manages to give any of these plots the resolution they deserve then it will be incredibly satisfying to watch.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode #15 Releases 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #15 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, November 2. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 2 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #14? 
          

Episode #14 began by resolving the fight between Mei Mei, Ui Ui, and the Smallpox Deity. After dispatching the curse with one of her crows, Mei Mei is now facing down the main villain possessing Geto&#39;s body, which will likely make for a great fight later in the arc. The rest of the episode focused on the battle between Nanami, Naobito, Maki, and the newly awakened Disaster Curse Dagon. Dagon was able to get the upper hand in the fight by trapping the others in his Domain Expansion. Luckily Megumi showed up and provided a reprieve with his domain expansion. He was able to use this to create a hole to escape through, but at the end of the episode Toji used that hole to enter the fight.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #15 Will Show Toji&#39;s Power 
          

Toji is one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most powerful sorcerers, only defeated originally by Gojo, who is now sealed. While all the other fighters in Dagon&#39;s domain are powerful, none of them will likely be able to defeat him. Based on the little screen time he has had this arc, he likely wouldn&#39;t be opposed to killing everyone in the domain especially once he sees that there are members from the Zenin clan there. This may just turn the fight into a massacre or it could potentially lead to an unlikely alliance between Dagon and the sorcerers to take Toji down. Alternatively, Megumi&#39;s presence could have a calming effect on his father, although given how much of a deadbeat Toji was this isn&#39;t too likely.

While most of the Shibuya Incident arc has been pretty good so far, episodes #13 and #14 have taken the arc to another level. If episode #15 manages to maintain this quality, then the Shibuya Incident may truly go down as one of the best arcs in Shonen history. Although if it lives up to the potential of its cliffhanger, it is hard to see how Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #15 could be bad.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #15 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 2, 2023.
