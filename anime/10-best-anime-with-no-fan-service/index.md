## Literature Review

While fan service has its time and place, some fans are simply tired of common tropes and unnecessary scenes that seem to add nothing to the story.





It should be mentioned that even anime titles known for their fan service scenes can still be good in their own right. However, for those who would rather avoid it altogether, there is still a large variety of options available. These are the types of shows that simply wouldn&#39;t benefit from any amount of fan service, as such gratuitous scenes are unnecessary to advance the plot or set the mood.









 








 10  Death Parade 
        

Whenever a show tries to approach a philosophical idea, such as the meaning of life and death, there is always a chance of it being too blunt and resulting in a message that feels shallow and crude. Death Parade stands out from other titles because it makes a genuine attempt to present different possible views and issues of the systems set in place. Here, people who die at the same time go neither to heaven nor to hell, but rather to a bar where they are asked to play a game, whose outcome is equivalent to the destination of their souls. However, this game is not as simple as it may seem.





 9  Spy x Family 
        

At a time defined by the ongoing secret war of information threatening to disrupt the peace efforts between neighboring countries Ostania and Westalis, the most unlikely group ends up having to play family. With the intention of gathering intelligence on a corrupt politician, Westalis&#39; most talented spy, codename &#34;Twilight&#34; takes on a mission that requires him to act as the husband of Yor, one of Ostania&#39;s most deadly assassins, also known as the &#34;Thorn Princess&#34;, and father to Anya, who is a secretly an esper with the power to read minds. Having to hide their true identities from each other, the interactions between the three are as endearing as they are comedic.





 8  Violet Evergarden 
        

Violet Evergarden follows the eponymous protagonist, a girl who, having lived her entire life knowing nothing but the battlefield, finds herself at a loss once the war is over, and she has nowhere to go. Upon learning of Auto Memory Dolls, she decides to become one herself, moved by the idea of understanding people&#39;s thoughts and conveying their messages to others. Though the show may be named after Violet, the story is much about her and her journey, as it is about the people she meets along the way. Every client she interacts with has a realistic and emotional backstory, and Violet&#39;s growth is captivating from the beginning to the end.





 7  Mob Psycho 100 
        

Mob Psycho 100 follows Shigeo Kageyama, more commonly known as the titular &#34;Mob&#34; due to his unassuming appearance, a boy who tries not to stand out, despite possessing highly potent psychic powers. Having realized at a young age that his powers are more dangerous than helpful, Mob tries his best to control himself and keep his abilities in check, but whenever his emotional level is too high, he ends up being overwhelmed and unable to control himself any longer. A brilliant title from the creator of One Punch Man that perfectly blends action with comedy, the show also boasts high-quality memorable animation and a recognizable art style.





 6  Kino&#39;s Journey 
        

Kino&#39;s Journey follows the titular traveler Kino as they embark on a long road trip alongside Hermes, a talking motorcycle. The purpose of this journey is not only to learn more about the world but also to self-discovery. They travel to varied countries, each defined by unique customs and culture, which range from genuinely tragic to perplexing and morally ambiguous. However, neither Kino nor Hermes ever seek to influence the world around them, or any of the societies that they come across. Instead, they are mere observers, whose adventures prove that the world is beautiful only thanks to its flaws and imperfections.





 5  Kaguya-sama: Love is War 
        

Regardless of the medium, romcoms have become a universally tried-and-true genre by now, but they also have somewhat of a reputation for being generally uninspired and unoriginal. Kaguya-sama: Love is War is the perfect title to prove that the world will never run out of creative ideas, and that romcoms don&#39;t have to be inferior to their peers in any aspect. The story revolves around the titular Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, two members of an elite high school&#39;s student council, who, despite being in love with each other, are too proud to admit it, which makes every day a tense battle of emotions between the two.

 4  Ya Boy Kongming! 
        

As common as reincarnation stories may be in the medium, there is no title quite like Ya Boy Kongming!, which stands out not only through its premise, but also through its quality. The story follows Zhuge Kongming, an illustrious strategist from China&#39;s Three Kingdoms era, who is reborn in modern-day Japan, where he meets Eiko Tsukimi, an aspiring singer. Moved by her voice and determined to help her achieve the fame and success that he considers her worthy of, Kongming decides to become her manager. Somehow, applying ancient war strategies to the modern entertainment industry results in a surprisingly enjoyable and unique show.





 3  Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! 
        

There are few titles quite as emblematic of the medium as Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, a show focused on the wonders of conceptualizing and creating anime. The events revolve around a truly unique school club, the animation club. Its members are Midori Asakusa, a curious and imaginative girl who enjoys drawing backgrounds and creating stories, Sayaka Kanamori, the more serious and realistic member of the group, who takes on the role of the producer, and Tsubame Misuzaki, who admires the human form and enjoys animating stories. A true love letter to animation of any form, this show is genuinely unmissable for anyone keen on the topic.





 2  Oshi No Ko 
        

A title that took the anime world by storm when it was first released, Oshi No Ko is not just another typical reincarnation story. Though it may be reminiscent of other idol shows at a glance, a quick look beneath the surface reveals that there is nothing in common between the two. Rather than focusing on the efforts and goals of idols, Oshi No Ko seeks to depict and discuss the more serious issues inherently present in the entertainment industry, making it a decidedly more mature title. The story of Ai Hoshino and her children is truly one of a kind, making for an impactful and memorable experience.





 1  Any Studio Ghibli Film 
        

To many fans of the medium, the question of which title is their favorite is bound to be followed up by a mention of Studio Ghibli, one of the anime industry&#39;s most beloved studios. Ironically enough, one of the main factors that allow this studio to shine is just how different it is from the rest of the industry, following personal stories instead of grand adventures. Moreover, every film is instantly recognizable due to the studio&#39;s distinctive and timeless animation style. However, choosing the best Studio Ghibli movie would be simply impossible; every title is special in its own way, and every anime fan knows which one holds a special place in their heart.
When surrounded by titles that seem to always include fan service, for some reason or another, it may be easy to generalize and overestimate the difficulty of finding one that doesn&#39;t rely on such scenes. However, this list proves that the options are more varied than they may first seem. From light-hearted stories of romance and comedy to more serious ones that explore the nature of life, humanity, and the complexity of the world, the range of possibilities covers just about every genre and theme. Yet among all of them, these are some of the best anime with no fan service.
