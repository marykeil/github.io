## Literature Review

Dogs are one of the most beloved creatures on Earth, so it&#39;s no surprise they&#39;re a common sight in anime, with some outshining their human friends.




Everyone loves a good dog, and that&#39;s just as true when it comes to anime dogs as it is in real life. Like a real dog, the best anime dogs are those that are loyal to their masters, eager for a pet or two, and willing to leap to the defense of the weak.
When it comes to anime dogs, though, the looks can vary a lot more than with real dogs. They might be part devil, or yokai, or some other higher order of spiritual creature, but in the end, a dog is still a dog. The best anime dogs are fiercely loyal companions that can act as cute mascots without getting too annoying or hogging the spotlight from the real story. These anime dogs have proven they&#39;re highly capable both as dogs and as adventuring companions, making them the ideal partners.

Kekkaishi, produced by Sunrise, based on the manga by Yellow Tanabe
        

Madarao is a wolf-like Ayakashi, a type of Japanese demon that can be difficult to control, and typically takes the form of a floating creature. Madarao, however, is equipped with a collar that helps to keep its power in check. Madarao is capable of speech as a result of being an Ayakashi, and has a surprisingly sensitive personality. He&#39;s fantastically powerful, and should that collar come off, is capable of growing to an absolutely immense size. Madarao works with Yoshimori and Tokine, the eponymous Kekkaishi, to battle against other dangerous Ayakashi.

Dragon Ball Z, produced by Toei Animation, based on the manga by Akira Toriyama
        

Bee is just an ordinary, injured dog that Buu and Mr. Satan happened to find. Buu healed it, and instantly developed a bond, as Bee&#39;s presence helped to keep Buu from being destructive. Of course, that&#39;s when a rather cruel mercenary, Van Zant, took a shot at Bee, seemingly killing the dog and enraging Buu. Buu was able to bring Bee back to life, but ultimately lost control altogether when Mr. Satan was shot. After the Buu saga, Good Buu keeps Bee for many years to come, with the happy dog making occasional appearances in Dragon Ball Super.

Tadakichi-san is so easygoing as a dog that he even gets along with Sakaki&#39;s cat, Maya. Chiyo has had Tadakichi-san for five years at the beginning of the story, and he&#39;s still going strong by the time Azumanga Daioh wraps up, shown to be with Chiyo even in America.

Kiba is able to communicate with Akamaru, which helps to facilitate their close relationship. By the time of Shippuden, Akamaru has grown into a full-sized dog, big enough for Kiba to ride, and is capable of transforming into a more feral red state when he consumes special Chakra-restoring pills. Akamaru and Kiba&#39;s ultimate attack involves the pair fusing together into a two-headed wolf, showcasing the true depths of their connection.

 6  Pochita - The Chainsaw Dog That Gave His Life For His Best Friend 
Chainsaw Man, produced by MAPPA, based on the manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto
        

Pochita is the Chainsaw Devil, but he&#39;s also just a little guy who really loves his master, Denji. So much so, in fact, that when Denji dies, Pochita fuses with him, saving his life at the expense of Pochita&#39;s existence as a separate entity. As a result, Pochita plays a relatively small role in Chainsaw Man, but he quickly became a beloved character, and can be seen celebrated by fans on all manner of merchandise. Pochita is easily the cutest creature to ever have a chainsaw coming out of its head, and its dog-like mannerisms were key to endearing fans.

Litten and Stoutland care for each other very much, and Stoutland wants to make sure that Litten will be okay when he&#39;s not around anymore. Unfortunately, that day comes too soon, and Stoutland dies in one of the Pokémon anime&#39;s saddest episodes ever. Ash decides he will take care of Litten now, and Litten allows itself to be caught.

Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, produced by David Production, based on the manga by Hirohiko Araki

Iggy is a bit rude, farting directly in Polnareff&#39;s face and laughing about it, but when the chips are down, he&#39;s a reliable partner. Iggy famously battled hard against Dio&#39;s pet bird Pet Shop, which had a fearsome stand of its own, in one of the few fights between two animals with Stands. Tragically, Iggy doesn&#39;t make it to the end of the series, but his courage in battle will never be forgotten by the Joestars.
