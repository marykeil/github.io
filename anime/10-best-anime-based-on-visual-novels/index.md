## Literature Review

While most anime are based on manga or light novels, some are based on visual novels, which make for incredibly unique and rich narratives.





Of course the biggest challenge in adapting a visual novel is condensing all the content contained within into a clear narrative. While someone playing a visual novel can experience all of its diverging story paths, most anime are constrained to one straightforward narrative which usually necessitates making some major cuts. Some series on this list have gotten around this by making multiple anime to encompass the entire story. This list will just be focusing on one entry per franchise however for the sake of variety. That being said, here are the 10 best anime based on visual novels.









 








 9  School Days 
        

School Days is probably the weirdest entry on this list as it is more here for its iconic place in anime history rather than for its quality itself. That isn&#39;t to say that the series is bad, as the high school drama following Makoto and his relationship with two girls Sekai and Kotonoha can be entertaining for viewers who like their stories incredibly dark. However, the finale of the series was so dark that it was infamously pulled from the air due to a real life tragedy that occurred around the same time that resembled its events. For those who want to know the origin of the &#34;Nice Boat&#34; meme or just want an edgy slice of anime history, School Days is a great watch.





 8  Danganronpa 
        

Danganronpa is one of the more popular visual novels that have seen a degree of mainstream success largely due to its killer premise and many twists and turns. The story follows a group of gifted students at Hope&#39;s Peak high school who are forced to participate in a death game by a mysterious robotic bear named Monokuma. While many fans feel that the game is better than its anime adaptation, the Danganronpa anime still does a good job at capturing the thrilling story of the visual novel and bringing its characters to life. This makes Danganronpa a must-watch for fans of the death game genre.





 7  Little Busters! 
        

Little Busters! is a charming anime following a high schooler named Riki as he must recruit members to a baseball team to revive a group of friends he had as a kid known as the Little Busters before one of them graduates. A mystery element also surfaces early on in the show with one of the Little Busters finding a note telling them to solve the mysteries of the world. While Little Busters! isn&#39;t the most action packed show on this list, it is a charming story that serves as a great slice of life romance series for fans of that genre.





 6  Ef: A Tale of Memories 
        

Many visual novel adaptations feature one protagonist faced with a bevy of potential romantic partners, but Ef mixes up this formula by having multiple romances between various characters. Among this cast are Hiro and Miyako who meet when the latter steals the former&#39;s bicycle and Renji and Chihiro who want to write a book together. While this focus on multiple different storylines and groups of characters may seem hard to juggle, Ef handles it seemingly effortlessly, providing a satisfying and emotional narrative sure to satisfy any romance fans.





 5  Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 
        

There have been various attempts to make an anime adaptation of Fate/Stay Night but arguably the most successful one is the series made by Ufotable following the Unlimited Blade Works path. The series follows Shirou Emiya as he gets embroiled in a Holy Grail War, in which sorcerers summon heroic spirits from the past to compete in a battle royale. The anime is filled with many epic fights the Fate franchise is known for. If fans want the full story, the original Studio Deen adaptation covered the main route of the visual novel and the movie series Fate/Stay Night: Heaven&#39;s Feel covered the darkest route involving the character Sakura.





 4  Kanon 
        

Some of the best visual novel adaptations are more down to earth romantic dramas and Kanon is no exception. Although it is often overshadowed by a certain entry later on in this list, Kanon is still an incredible anime. It follows Aizawa Yuuichi as he returns to a town from his youth and encounters various girls from his past. In the process he unearths memories that he had long forgotten, which adds a bit of mystery to this incredibly emotional journey. While its animation style may feel dated Kanon still holds up today as one of Kyoto Animation&#39;s early masterpieces.





 3  Higurashi: When They Cry 
        

One of the only horror series on the list, Higurashi has a rather unique premise that easily draws its viewers in. It follows Keiichi as he moves into a sleepy small village before a festival. However, not is all as it seems and as Keiichi investigates a series of murders and disappearances apparently tied to the festival he finds deeper mysteries and horrific tragedies in equal measure. What makes the series unique is its repetitive plot structure, examining alternative versions of the events leading up to the festival in a fascinating way. While not for the faint of heart, Higurashi is one of the best horror anime of all time, doing justice to the visual novels it is based on.





 2  Clannad 
        

Clannad is often cited as one of the most emotional anime of all time, and it lives up to that hype. It follows Tomoya as he helps a girl named Nagisa to reform their school&#39;s drama club. In doing so he meets a variety of other girls and helps them each overcome their personal problems. However, the series becomes truly great in its sequel series Clannad: After Story, which follows its characters as they graduate high school. While its art may seem a bit dated just like Kanon&#39;s, Clannad is still a must-watch series for any anime fans who want a show that will make them cry.





 1  Steins;Gate 
        

Stein&#39;s;Gate is an incredible story in its own right, but what propels it to the top of this list is how it feels like it incorporates a visual novel&#39;s structure into its narrative. The series follows the self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintaro, who accidentally discovers a form of time travel. He attempts to use this technology to fix various problems but is eventually embroiled in a vast conspiracy that pushes him to his limit. Filled with crazy twists, Steins;Gate will keep viewers on the edge of their seat until its climactic conclusion. The branching timelines in this series align well with the typical diverging paths of the game making Steins;Gate the best anime adaptation of a visual novel.
Ultimately these anime all undertake the incredibly difficult task of translating their story from a visual novel format to a television series and succeed at it. In recent years there haven&#39;t been as many new adaptations of visual novels, which is a shame as these series prove it can be done well. For now these are the top 10 anime based on visual novels but hopefully some more stellar shows will be adapted from the other great visual novels that currently exist.
