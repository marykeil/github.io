## Literature Review

From sequels that exceed the expectations set by their predecessors to new stories that took the world by storm, 2023 was a great year for fantasy.




2023 has undoubtedly been great for fantasy anime, providing fans of the medium with a plethora of memorable experiences, both in the form of entirely new and original stories, as well as brilliant continuations and even finales of much-beloved franchises. For viewers who are particularly keen on fantasy, these titles were certainly at the top of their lists, making them the best fantasy anime of 2023.
Some of these titles are sequels of shows that fantasy fans were surely already familiar with, continuing to provide everything that fans loved about previous seasons and even exceeding expectations at times. Others are but the beginning of stories that have the potential to reach equally great if not even greater heights than the popular fantasy titles that anime fans hold in high regard already. Regardless, all of them stand out in one way or another, telling remarkable stories set in imaginative worlds.









 








 10  Shangri-La Frontier Captures the Pure Fun of Gaming and Fighting Bosses 
Produced by C2C and Based on the Manga by Ryousuke Fuji &amp; Katarina
        

Rakurou Hizutome is an ordinary high school student who loves finding and beating new VR games, particularly the bad ones, full of bugs and glitches, that most would avoid. Convinced to try something different for a change, he starts playing the titular Shangri-La Frontier, an extremely popular VRMMO defined by its expansive world, creative systems, and wide range of monsters to take on.
The title may seem no different from conventional isekai stories at a glance, but it more than makes up for its uninspiring premise through the quality of its execution. Shangri-La Frontier&#39;s worldbuilding and boss designs are surprisingly detailed, featuring some of the best animation in battle shōnen titles.
Shangri-La Frontier is currently airing, so its direction and quality are still liable to change. However, preliminary reviews are very positive and viewers (especially those who are into gaming) generally consider it a fun and refreshing experience.

 8  My Happy Marriage Hides Its Supernatural Background Behind Its Central Romance Story 
Produced by Kinema Citrus and Based on the Novel by Akumi Agitogi &amp; Tsukiho Tsukioka
        

My Happy Marriage follows Miyo Saimori, a girl with a troubled past, who lost her mother at a young age and was abused by the rest of her family. Seemingly fated to continue her unfortunate life, she is told that she is to marry Kiyoka Kudou, a soldier from a prestigious background known for his cruel personality and his tendency to neglect those around him.
However, this might just be her chance to finally attain happiness, as Kiyoka proves to be more complex than most would assume. Although the focus of My Happy Marriage lies on romance, the premise is intentionally misleading, hiding an intriguing fantastical world defined by supernatural powers.
