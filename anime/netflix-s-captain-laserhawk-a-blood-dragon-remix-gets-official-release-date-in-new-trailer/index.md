Announced nearly two years ago, Ubisoft&#39;s Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix is finally releasing on Netflix this year.





Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix is a spin-off of the hit video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and will incorporate many aspects of Ubisoft&#39;s massive catalog of games. The series was announced back in 2021 by Adi Shankar, with an official release date set for October 2023.

 Dolph Laserhawk Looks Amazing In the Anime&#39;s Trailer 

 

The trailer was nothing short of gorgeousl. Dolph Laserhawk is set in a dystopian city where corruption and injustice is rampant. After being betrayed by his lover, the titular Dolph Laserhawk is detained in a maximum prison. Much like in DC&#39;s Suicide Squad, a bomb is planted in his body along with other detainees, and they are sent on deadly missions. The trailer is action packed and seemingly does the source material justice. Premiering on October 19 on Netflix, Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix seems very promising.




Ubisoft has released the series&#39; official synopsis:


Premiering this fall, the series is set in an alternative 1992 in the country formerly known as the USA. Now called Eden, it is a technocracy ruled by propaganda and corruption. Super-soldier Dolph Laserhawk has just been betrayed by the love of his life and locked up in Edenâ€™s top security prison Supermaxx. He must now lead a team of rebel outcasts on risky undercover missions in order to survive.


Adi Shankar, the director of Castlevania and the recently announced Devil May Cry anime, is the producer and creator of the show. He will be working alongside Mehdi Leffad, the art director from Arcane: League Of Legends. British actor Nathaniel Curtis will voice Dolph Laserhawk, Mark Ebulue as Marcus Holloway, Adi Shankar as Niji Six, Boris Hiestand as Alex. Many of the characters have been inspired from games such as Assassin&#39;s Creed and Rainbow Six Siege.

Together with Ubisoft, this new series is a mash-up of different beloved games that will draw in a wide net of fandoms and will certainly be enjoyable. Netflix&#39;s anime section has a bright future and will certainly propel the company to the top of the anime industry.




Captain Laserhawk: Dragon Blood will be available to stream on October 19 exclusively on Netflix.
