# Longstanding Spirited Away Fan Theory Debunked By Ghibli Director


## SUMMARY 



  The popular rumor that No-Face from Spirited Away was based on animator Hiromasa Yonebayashi is a misunderstanding.   The truth is that Yonebayashi was drawing a rendition of No-Face that Hayao Miyazaki noticed and remarked it looked like Yonebayashi.   Although Yonebayashi did not directly inspire No-Face, he still had a role in the success of Spirited Away and his career in the anime industry.

## Literature Review

One persistent rumor behind the acclaimed movie has turned out to be a matter of miscommunication, according to director Yonebayashi.




The anime film Spirited Away is rife with trivia, but as it turns out, one regarding the popular character No-Face happens to stem from a misunderstanding. An oft-repeated &#34;fact&#34; is that the mask-wearing ghost is modeled on Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who worked on the movie&#39;s key animation. An interview, however, sheds light on the true relationship between Yonebayashi and the genesis of the popular anime character.




No-Face forms the crux of a major subplot in Spirited Away, serving as an ally or an obstacle to Chihiro at different times throughout the movie. Its memorable scenes and design are unforgettable for anime fans, and the idea of it being modeled on a Ghibli staff member has an element of laughable believability to it. But like all myths, this idea is based on misheard statements.


 


 Ghibli Interview Reveals Origin Of No-Face Theory 
Produced by Studio Ghibli
         

The truth of the matter was repeated on Unseen Japan&#39;s X account, which links to a Ghibli fan site. There, it reports a Ghibli exhibition that took place at the Edo-Tokyo Open-Air Architectural Museum, which Hiromasa Yonebayashi attended. When a TV interviewer brought up the rumor, the animator and director finally cleared up the situation. What happened was that Yonebayashi was drawing a rendition of No-Face that Hayao Miyazaki noticed and would remark, &#34;It looks like Maro&#34; (Yonebayashi&#39;s nickname). So, while a No-Face sketch might have shared a resemblance, No-Face&#39;s official concept owes nothing to the Spirited Away key animator.




Yonebayashi went on to assist Ghibli with several more films, and eventually got his shot at directing The Secret World of Arietty in 2010. In 2014, he left Ghibli to form Studio Ponoc alongside several other Ghibli alum. Nonetheless, the influence is still felt, especially with their latest film, The Imaginary, which shares Ghibli&#39;s familiar art style. Still, Yonebayashi returned to provide key animation again for Miyazaki&#39;s The Boy and the Heron. With this sort of influence on Ghibli&#39;s movies, it is fitting that he remains connected to the studio&#39;s mythology, even if it is through a piece of trivia.

          

Spirited Away has many more interesting pieces of trivia, according to the Ghibli fan site, collected from various interviews and articles. For instance, the Stink Spirit was inspired by Miyazaki&#39;s experience cleaning river beds, while the famous train sequence takes cues from the 1927 novel Night on the Galactic Railroad. And while Yonebayashi was not used for No-Face, Chihiro&#39;s father does use the likeness of Japan TV&#39;s producer, Seiji Okuda. Nonetheless, fans of Spirited Away should recognize the key animator&#39;s part in its success, as well as its place as a stepping stone for his rise in the anime industry.
