On that note, from traditional uplifting dramas to genre-bending sports comedies, even those utterly uninterested in sports may find something of interest.









 








 15  How Heavy Are The Dumbbells You Lift? (2019) 
Animated By Doga Kobo &amp; Based on the Manga By Yabako Sandrovich &amp; MAAM
        

Since How Heavy Are The Dumbbells You Lift is a more adult anime that thrives on fan service and distinctly anime feel-good humor, it may not be to everyone&#39;s taste. But, for anyone who has been in the pursuit of bodybuilding or regular fitness, the comedic stylings of How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift? are enough to entertain. The central character of the series is gluttonous high schooler Hibiki Sakura.

 14  Eyeshield 21 (2005) 
Animated By Gallop &amp; Based on the Manga By Yusuke Murata &amp; Riichiro Inagaki
        

American football isn&#39;t particularly popular in Japan, though it may surprise some to discover that the country actually does have a professional league for the sport known as the X-League. American football was also represented briefly through the relatively short-lived anime series Eyeshield 21. When the timid Sona Kobayakawa develops a hidden talent for running and evasion after years of eluding school bullies, he anonymously joins an American football team while wearing a face-concealing visor and going by the moniker Eyeshield 21. Eyeshield 21&#39;s unique hook and compelling cast of characters undeniably mark it as one of the best sports anime ever.

 13  Yowamushi Pedal (2013) 
Animed By TMS Entertainment &amp; Based on the Manga By Wataru Watanabe
        

Yowamushi Pedal&#39;s Sakamichi Onda is a high school otaku whose interests do not exceed the bounds of anime and general nerd culture. However, when a famous cyclist and fellow student happens to discover Sakamichi&#39;s surprising prowess on his bulky, beach cruiser-like bike, he&#39;s roped into the world of cycling. A series about coming out of one&#39;s shell and discovering new passions and interests as much as it is about cycling, Yowamushi Pedal adds quite a bit of personality and intrigue to a sport that isn&#39;t often covered in most media.

Animated By Trans Arts &amp; Production I.G., Based on the Manga By Takeshi Konomi
        

Premiering back in the mid-aughts, Prince of Tennis drifts away from the typical sports anime narrative.

With his presence, the team becomes a force to be reckoned with. However, despite being a great player, Ryouma wishes to become the finest tennis player in Japan and create his own legacy instead of living under his father&#39;s shadow.

Animated By Madhouse &amp; Based on the Manga By Yuki Suetsugu
        

Spanning over several seasons and OVAs, Chihayafuru has an intriguing card game called Karuta at its fore. Both physically and mentally demanding, the game draws its inspiration from the classic Japanese anthology of Hundred Poets.

 10  Major (2004) 
Animated By Studio Hibari &amp; SynergySP, Based on the Manga By Takuya Mitsuda
        

A long-running baseball-centric anime that originally debuted in 2004, Major follows the career of Goro Honda, the son of a prominent baseball star whose career was sidelined by injury. Out to overcome adversity and escape the woes brought upon him by familial drama, Goro goes from an innocent schoolboy to a promising major-league prospect. As is the case with any anime series, it&#39;s full of emotion, suspense, and hyperbolic over-exaggeration. Yet, baseball is a hugely important sport in Japan, and even Western fans will want to check out this genre-defining sports anime.





 9  Run With The Wind (2018) 
Animated By Production I.G. &amp; Based on the Novel By Shion Miura
        

Unlike most anime that are adapted from manga, Run with the Wind is a novel adaptation. As its title suggests, the show is about competitive running. But, along with the generic narrative surrounding the progress of its main characters in their sport, it also delves deep into the mental catharsis of its protagonist, Haiji. Despite having a high school team full of novice runners, Haiji sets his eyes on the ridiculously hard university marathon relay races in Japan. Winning aside, to even be able to compete against Japan&#39;s best runners, the team will have to surpass many hurdles along the way. With breathtaking animation and a lovable cast of characters, Run With the Wind certainly made an impact.

 8  Ace of Diamond (2013) 
Animated By Madhouse &amp; Production I.G., Based on the Manga By Yuji Terajima
        

Ace of Diamond tells the story of Eijun Sawamura, a young pitcher who develops a reputation thanks to his atypical style.

Eijun&#39;s skills land him a spot at Japan&#39;s notorious Seidous High School, though he&#39;s fraught with competition from both competing teams and fellow teammates. While Ace of Diamond follows many familiar shounen sports anime story beats, it&#39;s one anime fans who also happen to watch baseball need to check out.

 7  Kuroko’s Basketball (2012) 
Animated By Production I.G. &amp; Based on the Manga By Tadatoshi Fujimaki


 







The quick-paced quarters, the dramatic time-outs, the high-intensity action—the sport of basketball has all the right ingredients to make up a taut and enticing anime series. That explains why so many shows use the sport as a narrative device. While Kuroko’s Basketball does the same, it adds a layer of fantasticism to the sport. There&#39;s a whole lot of unrealistic dunking, passing, and martial arts-centric action. Viewers looking for strategic gameplay and lessons on real-life basketball may not get much out of this, but, for fans of shonen anime, this one perfectly fits the bill.

 6  Free! Iwatobi Swim Club (2013) 
Original Anime Series By Kyoto Animation
        

Some viewers might scoff at Free!&#39;s intensive fan service, but there&#39;s a lot more to the anime than just the good looks of its heroes. The series&#39; character are Free!&#39;s heart, all of whom get relatively balanced development throughout its runtime. Despite having a fairly predictable premise, Free! keeps viewers intrigued with its high-octane swimming competitions and rivalries. Not to mention, since KyoAni is behind the anime&#39;s production, both the style and quality of its animation make it one of the best-looking sports anime ever.

 4  Haikyuu!! (2014) 
Animated By Production I.G. &amp; Based on the Manga By Haruichi Furudate


 







Haikyuu!! is among the most popular anime of the modern era, and it more than earns its incredible popularity. While its central premise rests on the volleyball adventures of a pint-sized protagonist named Hinata, the anime intricately explores the backstories of all its characters and never leaves a dull moment. Its on-court volleyball action is exciting enough to keep most viewers glued to it. But, more than that, it&#39;s the characters of this anime that allow it to rise above other generic sports outings that have been overtaking the genre.

 2  Slam Dunk (1993) 
Animated By Toei Animation &amp; Based on the Manga By Takehiko Inoue


 







Slam Dunk is a classic. As remembered by Sports Illustrated, when it first premiered, it had a massive impact on Japanese culture and served to popularize the sport in the country. What makes Slam Dunk such an epic anime is how it seamlessly shifts back and forth between its sports-centric action and the day-to-day high school hijinks of its characters. Along with that, it also heavily focuses on the technicalities of the sport and throws in several lessons here and there for aspiring basketball players. Its animation style might seem a bit dated today, but all of the other elements easily make up for that.

 1  Hajime No Ippo (2000) 
Animated By Madhouse &amp; Based on the Manga By George Morikawa
        

Essentially the Rocky of anime, even though it follows a typical fight-of-the-week format, the boxing journey of Hajime no Ippo&#39;s main character is awe-inspiring. Another aspect of the series that makes it stand out is the predictability of its boxing matches. No matter how hard a viewer tries to foresee the outcomes of its bouts, the anime always surprises with its outcomes—much like the real sport. For anyone who&#39;s looking for some inspiration to start working out or just to turn their lives around, Ippo&#39;s road from being bullied to becoming a boxing pro deserves a shot. Hajime no Ippo isn&#39;t just a classic, it stands tall as the greatest sports or fitness anime of all time.
