<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Anime is incredibly popular, but the amount of choice might overwhelm those who are just getting started. So here are the best anime for beginners!</p>
<p>This list is designed to bring shorter, more beginner-friendly anime series to the attention of new fans who are looking to dive into anime for the first time. These series range from action to romance to thrillers to comedy, meaning that there should be at least one entry on this list that&rsquo;s fit for anyone&rsquo;s tastes.</p>
<p>30  Mob Psycho 100</p>
<p>Release Year   2016    Episodes   37 + 2 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
Mob Psycho 100 isn&rsquo;t just one of the best anime series of all time, it&rsquo;s also a perfect introduction to the world of anime. The series focuses on a young man named Mob whose psychic powers are so immense that he has to close off his emotions to avoid setting them off. Together with his conman mentor Reigan, Mob battles evil spirits and other psychics obsessed with world domination. More so than most any other anime, Mob is a series that balances action, humor, and heart. The bond between Mob and Reigen is genuinely sweet and is sure to resonate with new fans of anime.</p>
<p>29  Jujutsu Kaisen</p>
<p>Release Year   2020    Episodes   35    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation <br>
Currently one of the most popular anime series, Jujutsu Kaisen is easily approachable for beginning anime fans. The series follows a young man named Yuji who is inducted into a secret society of sorcerers who are involved in a never-ending quest to destroy cursed spirits. Right alongside current hits like Demon Slayer and My Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen is no doubt responsible for ushering in a new generation of anime fans with its thrilling fights and breathtaking animation. Beginning anime fans certainly can&rsquo;t go wrong with Jujutsu Kaisen.</p>
<p>28  Hunter x Hunter</p>
<p>Release Year   2011    Episodes   148    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Netflix, Tubi, Pluto TV, and Peacock <br>
Hunter x Hunter is a beloved shonen series about a young man named Gon who goes on a quest to find his father, a Hunter named Ging. Far from a normal hunter though, the series&rsquo; Hunters are powerful individuals who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of a singular cause. With a lovable cast of characters and an approachable story, Hunter x Hunter is easy to jump into without much knowledge of other anime. The series is well paced too, starting off simple before unveiling one of the most intricate and fascinating power systems in anime history. Potential anime fans who want an entry point into classic shonen battle anime shouldn&rsquo;t pass up Hunter x Hunter.</p>
<p>27  Pokémon</p>
<p>Release Year   1997    Episodes   1,257    Where to Stream it   Roku, Tubi, Netflix, Hulu <br>
One of the longest-running anime series ever, it&rsquo;s no understatement to say that Pokémon is at least partially responsible for anime growing as popular as it is outside of Japan. Based on the popular game series, most of Pokémon follows a trainer named Ash as he travels across the world to try and become a better trainer. While the incredible episode count might seem like a massive barrier to some, potential anime fans shouldn&rsquo;t be scared off by it. The classic anime is purposefully designed so that each season is basically a reset, making Pokémon a great anime for fans of the game who want more out of the series.</p>
<p>26  Odd Taxi</p>
<p>Release Year   2021    Episodes   13    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
Odd Taxi is an incredibly original anime series about a Walrus cab driver who becomes embroiled in a criminal conspiracy that threatens to break his normally chill demeanor. The series won critics and fans over with its vibrant animation and instantly relatable characters, making it an easy frontrunner for anime of the year in 2021. Potential anime fans looking to get into the medium will find a lot to like about Odd Taxi as the multiple interconnecting stories it focuses on have more than a passing resemblance to something like Pulp Fiction. Potential viewers shouldn&rsquo;t let the cute character designs fool them though, as the series deals with mature topics.</p>
<p>25  Spy X Family</p>
<p>Release Year   2022    Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
Spy x Family is a starter anime series that strikes the perfect balance between action and comedy. The series focuses on super-spy Loid Forger and his &ldquo;family&rdquo; that he recruited as part of his cover, which consists of the deadly assassin Yor and the six-year-old mind-reader Anya. The kicker, though, is that none of them are aware of the others&rsquo; true identities (except Anya), leading to plenty of hijinks as they scramble to keep their secrets. Despite that layer of intrigue though, it&rsquo;s the Forgers&rsquo; everyday wholesome interactions that make the show constantly entertaining. A second season of Spy X Family is on the way, so it&rsquo;s a great time for anime beginners to dive into the series.</p>
<p>24  Cardcaptor Sakura</p>
<p>Release Year   1998    Episodes   70    Where to Stream it   Netflix, Crunchyroll <br>
A classic &rsquo;90s series that was foundational within the Magical Girl genre, the original Cardcaptor Sakura makes for a good starter anime for those interested in series more aimed at girls. The series has four seasons&rsquo; worth of episodes about Sakura Kinomoto, who accidentally releases a deck of magical cards. With the aid of her friend Tomoyo and rival Syaoran Li, Sakura reluctantly embarks on a quest to recapture all the magical cards and put a stop to the chaos they&rsquo;ve brought about. It&rsquo;s a fun series with a slowly building mythology that can draw one in. New anime fans who connect with Cardcaptor Sakura also have the 2018 sequel series, Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card, to look forward to.</p>
<p>23  Toradora!</p>
<p>Release Year   2008    Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Netflix, Crunchyroll <br>
Toradora! is a teen romantic comedy that has plenty of dramatic moments. Two teenagers, Ryuji and Taiga, find common ground when they realize they both have crushes on unattainable classmates. They decide to help one another with their crushes, but in true rom-com fashion, fall for one another instead. Watching the friendship between Taiga and Ryuji is one of the strongest aspects of the series as they both often proclaim that they can&rsquo;t stand one another, but are clearly the closest of friends. Romance anime often have memorable confessions, but it&rsquo;s the relatable way that Toradora builds up their relationship which makes it uniquely perfect as a starter anime.</p>
<p>22  RWBY</p>
<p>Release Year   2013    Episodes   116    Where to Stream it   Rooster Teeth <br>
With nine seasons so far, one might not think of the series as a great starter anime, but RWBY is actually deceptively short. Despite having so many seasons, the early episodes are incredibly short, some no more than 2 minutes in length, making the series a very quick watch.
It follows the titular Team RWBY and their allies as they work to become Hunters in a world plagued by monsters, known in RWBY as Grimm. Along the way, they end up on an epic quest to defeat the mysterious Salem. With a straight-to-video movie on the way in 2023, RWBY is an action-adventure series that continues to pack a serious punch.</p>
<p>21  The Promised Neverland</p>
<p>Release Year   2019    Episodes   23    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Netflix, Crunchyroll <br>
A relatively new entry for starter anime, The Promised Neverland is a series that starts off heartwarming before making a sudden shift into the dark fantasy and thriller genres. The series follows Emma and her friends Ray and Norman as they attempt to escape from the orphanage where they live without cluing in their caretaker, leading to many tense moments that will have viewers on the edge of their seats. The first season makes for a thrilling experience for fans who love mind games, while the second season was much less warmly regarded. The choice of genre makes The Promised Neverland fairly unique for the medium, and a good starter anime for those who enjoy Hollywood thrillers.</p>
<p>20  Lupin the Third Part IV: The Italian Adventure</p>
<p>Release Year   2015    Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Amazon Prime, Crunchyroll, Pluto TV <br>
The Lupin the Third franchise has a long history, but it makes for an excellent starter anime due to the fact that a viewer can start watching any season without needing information from previous seasons. The series follows master thief Lupin the Third and his associates, the marksman Jigen and the samurai Goemon as they plan heists, avoid the relentless inspector Zenigata, and occasionally save the world along the way. The Italian Adventure sees the crew in Italy, of course, and is a perfect blend of all the things that make Lupin fun: action, goofy humor, and lovable characters.</p>
<p>19  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba</p>
<p>Release Year   2019    Episodes   55    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix <br>
Anime is well known for its epic, over-the-top fight scenes, and there&rsquo;s no shortage of choice when it comes to that area. What makes Demon Slayer a uniquely perfect anime for beginners is that it takes that incredible animation to the next level. The series follows young Tanjiro Kamado, who after losing his family to a demon attack, finds that his sister is still alive, but now a demon herself. Desperate to save his last family, Tanjiro agrees to become a demon slayer in order to help search for a cure, facing off with fearsome foes with incredible courage. With a moving story, complex characters, and gorgeous art, Demon Slayer is a can&rsquo;t-miss starter anime series for those looking for action.</p>
<p>18  The Ancient Magus&rsquo; Bride</p>
<p>Release Year   2017    Episodes   37    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
The fairytale-like Ancient Magus Bride takes place in a magical version of modern England, where Celtic and Scandanavian monsters and fairies live unseen in the wilds, far beyond human civilization. No matter how new to anime they are, viewers will likely to recognize the familiar Western cultural touchstones of this series, from a grim church to dragons to the famed Titania and Oberon. The fascinating skull-headed Elias makes for a compelling character, certainly not what one would expect from the title. Fans who enjoy the first season also have a much-anticipated second season that&rsquo;s due in 2023 to look forward to.</p>
<p>17  Cells At Work!</p>
<p>Release Year   2018    Episodes   21    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Netflix <br>
Few works of fiction have portrayed the inner workings of the human body in an entertaining fashion, but Cells at Work! does it in true anime style. In the world of the series, the human body is a vast city of apartments, furnaces, and aqueducts, and hardworking anthropomorphic cells keep it all running. It&rsquo;s a tad bizarre for a starter anime, but many of the best anime embrace their weirdness head-on. The animation is gorgeous, Cells At Work explains the science well (this is an educational show), and the humor is spot-on. There are even fight scenes, with white blood cells and killer-T cells doing battle with bacteria and viruses, so even those into action shouldn&rsquo;t get bored. The show has two short seasons and a darker spinoff, called Cells At Work: Code Black, that highlights the inner workings of an unhealthy body.</p>
<p>16  Dr. Stone</p>
<p>Release Year   2019    Episodes   46    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu <br>
Dr. Stone is another educational animated series with an intriguing premise. The plot centers on a mysterious energy wave that turns the entire population of Earth to stone. So things stay until 3,700 years later, when the brilliant teenager Senku Ishigami awakens to find himself in a transformed world. He&rsquo;s in a new Stone Age, and with the power of science and his faith in the human race, he&rsquo;s going to rebuild everything, one rediscovered invention at a time. Dr. Stone&rsquo;s cast of odd characters are also around to liven things up, each with their own quirks. Just like the science-loving main character, Dr. Stone highlights how creative anime can be, and that&rsquo;s exactly why it&rsquo;s an ideal starter anime series.</p>
<p>15  Plastic Memories</p>
<p>Release Year   2015    Episodes   13    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
Fans of sci-fi and romance alike may enjoy this series, which combines elements of Blade Runner and The Fault in Our Stars for quite the combo. In this world, realistic androids have become a reality, but they have limited life spans and must be manually retired, sometimes against their will. Male lead Tsukasa Mizugaki is a newly hired robot &ldquo;retirer,&rdquo; and his companion is Isla, a robot who is on the verge of being retired herself. Tragically, that doesn&rsquo;t stop him from beginning to fall in love with Isla in a series that showcases anime&rsquo;s uncanny ability to make viewers cry.</p>
<p>14  Chainsaw Man</p>
<p>Release Year   2022    Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
As one of the hottest new series in recent years, Chainsaw Man has quickly come to be beloved by veterans, but it&rsquo;s also a great anime to start with as well. Adapted from the popular manga of the same name, it centers on the single-minded Chainsaw Man himself, Denji, who&rsquo;s saved from a brutal death by a chainsaw devil that is absorbed into his body. As a result, he ends up merged with the creature and now holds the ability to transform his body parts into chainsaws. Gory, action-packed, and funny, Chainsaw Man manages to capture the darker and lighter sides of anime in a single series.</p>
<p>13  Little Witch Academia</p>
<p>Release Year   2017    Episodes   25    Where to Stream it   Netflix <br>
Though new anime fans will more often be directed towards the action-packed My Hero Academia, the two series have more in common than their titles. In both shows, an unusually &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; child is inspired by his/her hero, then enrolls at a special school to emulate that hero.
For Little Witch Academia, that heroine is Akko, who is dying to become a witch to help people and make them happy. Her magic powers are minimal, but she&rsquo;s trying, and Little Witch Academia follows her as she makes new friends at witch school. The series&rsquo; light tone makes it welcoming to those new to anime, and thus an excellent choice for starter anime.</p>
<p>12  Parasyte: The Maxim</p>
<p>Release Year   2014    Episodes   24    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
Parasyte: the Maxim may be one of the most underrated anime of the past decade. Based on a classic manga series from the &rsquo;90s, Parasyte tells the story of a young man named Shinichi who wakes up to find that his right hand has been eaten and replaced with an alien parasite. The alien, eventually called Migi, is part of an invading force that has been quietly overrunning earth, and Shinichi has to learn to live with the parasitic creature if he is to stand a chance against them. Though a tad on the darker side (viewers must be okay with body horror), its compelling characters and their evolution throughout the series make Parasyte a must-watch starter anime.</p>
<p>11  Yuri!!! On Ice</p>
<p>Release Year   2016    Episodes   12 + 1 OVA    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
Yuri!!! on Ice is one of the few examples of LGBT+ love stories in anime. The series follows the titular Yuri, a Japanese figure skater who is considering quitting the sport, but who eventually catches the eye of Victor Nikiforov, one of the world&rsquo;s most renowned figure skaters. Victor becomes Yuri&rsquo;s coach as Yuri rediscovers his love for the sport, and a charming love story begins to develop between the two characters. Sweet and emotional, Yuri!!! On Ice is one of the best anime to watch for beginners in search of good LGBT+ romance.</p>
