## Literature Review

One Piece has revealed two eerily similar devil fruit abilities that could answer the biggest mysteries about the power and its origins.





Summary

  Luffy&#39;s devil fruit may not be as unique as fans thought, as Bonney&#39;s devil fruit also relies on imagination.   The true power of devil fruits in One Piece may be imagination itself, as both fruits have limitless potential based on the user&#39;s creativity.   Devil fruits may exist because of human desire and dreams, according to Vegapunk, making imagination the major catalyst and the most crucial power in the series.  







One Piece&#39;s latest arc has revealed its two most important devil fruits, and they might just explain the biggest secrets of the mysterious power. A recent chapter revealed that Luffy&#39;s devil fruit may not be as unique as the series has led fans to believe, confirming another devil fruit that functions on the very principles that make the Nika fruit the ridiculous power it is.

Chapter #1103 of One Piece reveals that Bonney&#39;s devil fruit, the Age-Age fruit, is very similar to the Nika fruit, with both devil fruits relying heavily on the power of imagination. In the chapter, Saturn confirms that Bonney&#39;s fruit allows her to turn into any form she can imagine, making her devil fruit as fearsome a power as the Nika fruit.

          

Both fruits hold limitless potential that depends entirely on the creativity of the user, suggesting that the most fundamental power in One Piece could possibly be imagination itself. In fact, based on Vegapunk&#39;s theory, the Age-Age Fruit and the Nika Fruit could be connected to the very origins of devil fruits.





 Bonney and Luffy&#39;s Devil Fruits Rely on Imagination 
          

Described by the Five Elders as &#34;the most ridiculous power in the world,&#34; what makes Luffy&#39;s devil fruit so unique is the freedom it offers, with the only limit being the extent of Luffy&#39;s imagination. This allows Luffy to manipulate not just himself but also the people and objects around him in any way he sees fit, often in cartoonish, reality-defying ways. Similarly, Bonney&#39;s devil fruit stands out for its peculiar ability called Distorted Future, which allows her to access alternate futures and make them a reality. As Saturn elucidates in chapter #1103, the number of possible outcomes depends entirely on Bonney&#39;s imagination and her perceived likelihood of these futures.

Hence, the true source of Luffy and Bonney&#39;s devil fruit powers and the factor that determines their strength isn&#39;t the fruit at all, but rather their imagination. It is safe to assume that such powers could not be more powerful than in the hands of those with a childish disposition, like Luffy and Bonney (who is quite literally a child) as children are best known for having the most colorful imaginations. This might also explain why Luffy was the first to awaken the Nika fruit in over 800 years, his vivid imagination possibly allowing him to harness the devil fruit&#39;s true power.






 Imagination is the Ultimate Power in One Piece 
          

The possibility that dreams and imagination may be the basis of all devil fruits powers in One Piece is also reminiscent of Vegapunk&#39;s theory on the origin of devil fruits. According to Vegapunk in chapter #1069, devil fruits may be the result of human desire, brought into existence by dreams of such powers. If so, human imagination itself can be credited for the existence of devil fruits, in turn explaining why the two that rely on it the most are also the most powerful devil fruits in the series.

                  One Piece Completely Changed Its Most Important Power System   One Piece&#39;s latest chapter reveals a shocking twist that could permanently alter the very fundamentals of its most important power system.   

Moreover, considering all devil fruits require some level of creativity to truly master, the determining factor of a devil fruit&#39;s maximum potential may instead be its user&#39;s imagination, making imagination the most crucial power in One Piece. All in all, even as One Piece enters the final saga of its story, devil fruits continue to remain as much of an enigma as when they were first introduced.
