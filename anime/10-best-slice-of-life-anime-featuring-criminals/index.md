## Literature Review

From Spy x Family to The Way of the Househusband, these anime series perfectly mix slice-of-life elements with memorable criminal characters.





The popularity of Spy X Family and its central characters, who harbor some dark and very illegal secrets, might be particularly interesting for anime fans into heist or crime stories too. However, it&#39;s far from the only great anime to hilariously combine criminals and everyday life. From shows where the criminals are a source of real drama, like Beastars, to ones where they&#39;re the butt of all the jokesm like The Way of the Househusband, there are tons of slice-of-life anime series where criminals play a big part.

 10  The Yakuza&#39;s Guide To Babysitting (2022 - ) 
        

Though The Yakuza&#39;s Guide to Babysitting isn&#39;t the first slice-of-life anime to imagine a criminal being forced into a situation where they need to care for a small child, they proved that there was still plenty of humor to be found from the premise last year. Its criminal main character is Tooru Kirishima, a yakuza member feared for his violent nature when enforcing the will of his boss.
However, in this uplifting slice-of-life anime, he&#39;s forced to take a more tactful approach when he&#39;s suddenly tasked with taking care of the boss&#39;s precious daughter. Showing their everyday lives as the two slowly come to understand each other, it&#39;s the clash in personalities between the two that&#39;s the source of the best comedy and the best heartfelt moments that The Yakuza&#39;s Guide to Babysitting has to offer.





 9  Durarara!! (2010) 
        

Whilst it&#39;s primarily a supernatural action show, there are enough slice-of-life elements in the intriguing Durarara!! to keep fans of the everyday-focused genre interested. Like a regular slice-of-life show, the strength of Durarara!! lies in its characters, which include a mysterious dark figure on a bike, the devious information broker Izaya, and the rough-edged bodyguard Shizuo.
Durarara!! is a great anime for beginners that weaves multiple plotlines together, including moments that show the everyday lives of its high-schooler main characters as they try to piece together the supernatural events that seem to be occurring in their dangerous part of town. Even they themselves might be more involved in criminal activity than they let on, making the show an intriguing mystery that&#39;s worth unwrapping.





 8  The Way Of The Househusband (2021 - ) 
        

Whilst The Way of the Househusband&#39;s central character, Tatsu, seems to have left a life of crime behind, that doesn&#39;t mean the series isn&#39;t full of current or former Yakuza members getting in the way of his newfound peaceful life as a stay-at-home husband. Once a notorious gangster, Tatsu approaches housework and being a good husband with the same zeal and seriousness as any criminal activity.
The Way Of The Househusband is a relatively short and sweet anime series and the animation itself is fairly bare-bones, but for anyone that enjoys the humor of an absurdly rough former Yakuza member dealing with everyday situations like shopping for groceries, the show&#39;s compact nature only makes it more of a joy. Funny and unique, the series gets an unbelievable amount of feel-good fun out of its former criminal protagonist.





 7  Persona 4 The Animation (2011 - 2012) 
        

Much like how the game combines ordinary social simulation with supernatural elements, Persona 4 the Animation mixes fun slice-of-life with an absorbing mystery centered on a series of brutal serial killings taking place in the rural town of Inaba. With the help of a strange phenomenon involving a TV channel, the high-schooler protagonists attempt to stop the killings.
Though the serial killer is largely a background figure, the presence of the hilarious delinquent Kanji Tatsumi, terror of the local police and gangs alike, more than makes up for it. Adapted from the amazing JRPG of the same name, Persona 4 the Animation might not be a match for the game in terms of slice-of-life content or fun action, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t entertaining in its own right.





 6  Hinamatsuri (2018) 
        

Another series in the surprisingly flourishing niche of shows where criminals end up taking care of young children, Hinamatsuri is slightly different in that the child in question is far from an ordinary one either. Materializing in a strange metal pod in front of Yakuza member Yoshifumi Nitta, she comes with some strange and dangerous powers that mean looking after her is a lot more fraught than usual.
Whether she proves a valuable asset to Nitta in his criminal affairs or whether she ends up blowing him up instead, the familial relationship that forms between the two makes up the heart of the show. Despite being an anime with a unique reverse isekai premise, Hinamatsuri thrives on the same everyday wholesomeness that all the best slice-of-life shows have, and just as importantly, it has many laugh-out-loud moments.





 5  Spy X Family (2022 - ) 
        

Proof that a slice-of-life series can be one of the most popular anime of the year when combined with just enough crime and intrigue to keep action fans happy too, Spy X Family is a comedy like no other. Its central family might seem ordinary, but it was actually put together by international spy Loid Forger and, unbeknownst to him, he might not even be the most dangerous criminal in the group.
With his fictional wife, Yor, secretly an underground assassin, and his child, Anya, able to read minds, everyone in the family has their secrets but that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t share heartwarming moments to rival the best slice-of-life shows. Along with Spy X Family&#39;s hilarious side characters, it&#39;s a recipe for hilarity and fun like no other and it&#39;s no surprise a second season is already on the way this year.

 4  Buddy Daddies (2023 - ) 
        

For a fresh slice-of-life comedy centered on criminals, Buddy Daddies began airing in January and has already gained fans looking for something to scratch that itch. The series begins with the professional assassins Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa about to pull off an elaborate scheme to kill a mob boss on Christmas Eve, but before it can become a very different kind of show, in wanders a lost four-year-old girl.
With their plan foiled, the pair end up taking the energetic Miri home and soon find fatherhood comes naturally to them despite their dangerous careers. Buddy Daddies is fast-paced and the jokes and action might be a little too non-stop for viewers hoping to experience a more laid-back slice-of-life anime. Despite that, the hijinks the pair get into whilst trying to keep the ever-unpredictable Miri safe in a dangerous world make for a great time.





 3  Tentai Senshi Sunred (2008 - 2010) 
        

Though it leans more toward an old-fashioned gag comedy style than a typical slice-of-life format, the hilarious way it shows superheroes and criminal masterminds in the most mundane situations means Tentai Senshi Sunred fits rights into the genre. The show is centered on the daily lives of Sunred, an ally of justice, and General Vamp, head of an evil organization bent on taking over the world.
Whilst that might make it sound more like high drama, it turns out their everyday lives are as ordinary as everyone else&#39;s, with Sunred a lazy gambling addict and Vamp a polite conscientious homemaker who takes good care of his minions. The best slice-of-life anime might have ridiculous premises but Tentai Senshi Sunred has them all beat with a short, punchy format that brings out all the absurd comedy of the contrasting hero and villain pair.

 2  Jormungand (2012) 
        

If some of the criminals that typically feature in slice-of-life anime aren&#39;t dangerous enough, Jormungand steps things up by centering on characters that are actually international criminals, illegally selling weapons whilst trying to avoid the wrath of the CIA. Despite the high stakes involved, Jormungand dwells on the ordinary elements of the life of Jonah, a bodyguard tasked with protecting the gang&#39;s leader.
That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t plenty of violence and action to enjoy in Jormungand too. At its heart, the show is an action series and it&#39;s more than satisfying when it comes to well-animated set pieces to set the heart racing. Whilst it might not be a charming low-stakes anime affair that slice-of-life fans often expect, Jormungand is one of the few shows that attempts to seriously portray the everyday lives of criminals, and that gives it a unique appeal.





 1  Beastars (2019 - ) 
        

Slice-of-life anime series revolving around high-school clubs might be incredibly common, but Beastars is different in that it takes place in a society comprised of anthropomorphic animals where carnivores and herbivores co-exist despite a heavy suspicion of one another. Despite rising tensions, Legoshi finds himself developing a bond with a white rabbit he meets while on lookout for the drama club.
Whilst Legoshi struggles with his carnivorous nature, the world turns out to be even more violent and twisted than it seems as the Lion Yakuza gang comes to play a major role. Despite that, it&#39;s a show that&#39;s at its best when showing the mundane lives of its characters as they grow and learn from each other. Featuring one of the best slice-of-life anime protagonists ever in the form of Legoshi, that&#39;s no surprise either.
