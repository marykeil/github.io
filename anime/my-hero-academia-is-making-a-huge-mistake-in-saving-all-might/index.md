# My Hero Academia Is Making A Huge Mistake In Saving All Might


## SUMMARY 



  All Might&#39;s death could have added nuance to Deku&#39;s final confrontation with Shigaraki, forcing him to question his kindness.   My Hero Academia&#39;s inability to kill off major characters highlights the series&#39; issues with plot armor and takes away from the emotional investment.

## Literature Review

My Hero Academia may have just ruined its final battle and Deku&#39;s character arc with one fell swoop by saving All Might.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #404 of My Hero Academia. As much as fans of My Hero Academia may not wish to bid farewell to the beloved hero, All Might&#39;s death may be precisely what the series needs to move forward, and the series may have made a huge mistake by saving him. Fans have been assuming All Might was guaranteed to die for some time now, so the fact that he lives comes as a genuine shock.




Chapter #404 of My Hero Academia has revealed that All Might has just barely survived his fateful battle against All For One thanks to the joint efforts of Bakugo and Deku. As relieved as fans may be by this fortunate turn of events, All Might&#39;s death may have been a huge missed opportunity.

          

 Over the years, All Might has grown just as dear to fans as he has to Deku as his beloved mentor and father figure. His mere presence has proven to be a pillar of support not only to Deku but also to heroes at large. That said, just as All Might&#39;s retirement served to usher in a new age, his death also had the capacity to leave a lasting impact on the story as well as on Deku and could have opened the door to some interesting conflict and a much more nuanced and impactful finale.




                  My Hero Academia Found The Perfect Way To Defeat Its Big Villain   My Hero Academia made All for One basically unbeatable, but the series finally found a way to bring down its main villain that makes perfect sense.   


 All Might&#39;s Death Adds Nuance to the Final Showdown Between Deku &amp; Shigaraki 
          

All Might&#39;s death could have made Deku&#39;s final confrontation with Shigaraki more meaningful as well as rounded out Deku&#39;s character arc by forcing him to question his inherent kindness for the first time in the series. The death of someone as close to Deku as All Might would force Deku to question his decision to save Shigaraki and make forgiving him all the more difficult thus introducing some much-needed conflict and nuance to the final battle as well as the culmination of Deku&#39;s journey so far.

Deku&#39;s desire to redeem Shigaraki despite his terrible actions indicates Deku&#39;s almost idealistic view of villains and the world around him hasn&#39;t changed since the beginning of the series despite the apocalyptic, dystopian state of events around him, with him still believing everyone can still be saved.




As Shigaraki points out when he taunts Bakugo and Deku in Chapter #404, All Might&#39;s death would serve as the perfect wake-up call to harsh reality. All Might&#39;s death would effectively force Deku to acknowledge the atrocities committed by Shigaraki and All For One as, while the series has killed off its fair share of characters before, none of these deaths have particularly impacted Deku like All Might&#39;s death right in front of his eyes would have. All Might&#39;s death would have been much, much more personal and hard-hitting and would have made Deku&#39;s ultimate decision about Shigaraki all the more impactful.

                  My Hero Academia&#39;s Big Revival Is A Huge Chance To Fix A Controversial Death   The resurrection of a beloved hero in My Hero Academia means the series can now justify a very controversial decision regarding Bakugo.   



 All Might&#39;s Survival Confirms a Bigger Problem with My Hero Academia 
          




My Hero Academia&#39;s inability to kill off a major character even after all the build-up and with all the pieces in place for a poignant ending is proof of the series following the template of Western superhero comics, where important characters implausibly escape death at every turn. While this isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, in the case of My Hero Academia, it only highlights the series&#39; long-running issues with plot armor and takes away from the emotional investment in each fight. All Might&#39;s death in Chapter #403 was all but given and would have made for a fitting end for the hero, especially after the heartfelt glimpse into his humble origins. All Might&#39;s death offered the opportunity for Deku to follow in his footsteps after his death just as he did after Nana&#39;s death and herald the beginning of a new era.

Nonetheless, My Hero Academia&#39;s story is quickly nearing its climax with the final showdown between Shigaraki and Deku looming quite literally just over the horizon, and while All Might&#39;s death may have been averted for now, there&#39;s no saying what may happen as My Hero Academia progresses so perhaps the series may get a chance to redeem this missed opportunity after all.
