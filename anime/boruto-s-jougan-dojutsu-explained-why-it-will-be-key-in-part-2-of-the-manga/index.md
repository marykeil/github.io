# Boruto s Jougan Dojutsu Explained Why It Will Be Key In Part 2 Of The Manga


## SUMMARY 



  Boruto&#39;s dojutsu, Jougan, is a key mystery of the story and its connection to the Otsutsuki Clan is still unknown.   Jougan is a unique eye technique that grants Boruto the ability to see chakra and access other dimensions through Space-Time Ninjutsu.   The title of Boruto Part 2, &#34;Two Blue Vortex,&#34; hints at the potential debut of Jougan in the manga and suggests that mastering it will play a crucial role in Boruto&#39;s journey.

## Literature Review

While rarely used in the story so far, Boruto’s Jougan looks to play a major role in the second part of the saga. Here’s a rundown of what it is.




Boruto&#39;s second part has had an explosive start, and its subtitle, Two Blue Vortex, strongly suggests that Boruto&#39;s dojutsu Jougan will play a significant role in what comes to pass. While the young ninja&#39;s powerful technique hasn&#39;t been explored fully yet, all signs point to it being important for the series going forward.




One of the common abilities of the most powerful individuals in the Naruto franchise is dojutsu, a potent chakra-fueled ocular ability that gives the possessor a range of skills from being able to instantly memorize any technique they see to trapping the whole world in an illusion. Originally passed on to humanity by Kayuga Otsutsuki through her sons Hagoromo and Hamura, a dojutsu tends to be hereditary but can be transplanted into someone who does not have the genetic aptitude for it.

          

The most famous dojutsu in the franchise are the Sharingan of the Uchiha clan, the Byakugan of the Hyuga, and the Rinnegan that descends from Hagoromo himself. Jougan is a dojutsu that debuted in the Boruto anime and has since made its way into the manga too.


 Jougan Is Boruto&#39;s Exclusive Eye Technique, But It&#39;s Still a Big Mystery 
          




Jougan, also known as the &#34;Pure Eye&#34;, presents itself as a featureless eyeball with no or little difference in color between the iris and the pupil, depicted as being light blue and when activated displaying a lighting-like energy pulse effect. The Jougan is known only by members of the Otsutsuki Clan, but their connection is still a mystery. Since Boruto was not born an Otsutsuki, nor had an eye transplant, his possession of Jougan is a key mystery of the story. However, considering his bloodline, it should not be so surprising that he has it. Boruto&#39;s is descended from Kayuga&#39;s son Hagoromo on his father&#39;s side, and descended from Kayuga&#39;s other son Hamura on his mother&#39;s side. Accordingly, Boruto might have the perfect mix of genetic material to manifest Jougan.

                  Boruto Two Blue Vortex Is The Perfect Platform To Retcon Naruto   Despite widespread complaints and fan dissatisfaction, Boruto has become an essential piece of the saga that can make Naruto canon better.   




The first real glimpse fans were given of Boruto&#39;s use of Jougan after the flash forward in episode #1 came in Boruto Episode #14 when his Jougan activates during a fight between Sumire and Mitsuki. At this point, Boruto does not seem to have much control over activating it, but once he does, he seems competent in using it to his advantage. Interestingly, the Jougan has rarely appeared in the Boruto manga, and fans are still debating if it&#39;s actually canon to it or not based on the flash-forward in chapter #1.



Though Boruto&#39;s right eye is damaged at the end of Part 1, Jougan appears to have the unique ability to restore sight when in use.






 Boruto Part 2 Can Finally Explain the Mysteries Of Jougan 
          




From the few appearances that it has made in the story, the Jougan has provided Boruto with two key abilities. First, it allows him to see chakra, the vital energy that is present in all living things, and map a person&#39;s individual chakra system just like the Byakugan. Second, Jougan gives Boruto some ability in Space-Time Ninjutsu, which until now has manifested as the capacity to perceive and access portals to different dimensions. This power could become key in Part 2, considering that Boruto&#39;s parents have been trapped in another dimension by Kawaki.

Boruto&#39;s Jougan has been the subject of constant debate among fans of the series, so the reveal of the title of Part 2 as Two Blue Vortex has clearly hyped up the expectation to see this technique making its debut in the manga. Considering that Boruto will need a significant power-up in order to face Kawaki and Eida and get back his family and life, it&#39;s possible that mastering Jougan will be a part of this process. However, the key to Jougan&#39;s helpfulness to Boruto will depend on how well he comes to understand and master its intricacies, including its dangerous connection with the Otsutsuki clan.
