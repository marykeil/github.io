## Literature Review

One of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest techniques is the Domain Expansion, and the series&#39; most powerful Domain Expansions are seriously scary.




Warning! Contains spoilers for the Jujutsu Kaisen Manga!!!In the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, the most powerful techniques are known as Domain Expansions. Few sorcerers and curses can actually use this ability, but those who can are some of the strongest in the series. This makes measuring the relative power level of these Domain Expansions a good indicator for the strength of the sorcerers themselves.
Domain Expansions are essentially an extension of the user&#39;s cursed technique throughout a space generally enclosed by a barrier. By suffusing the space contained in the barrier with their innate domain, the wielder of the Domain Expansion can use their technique anywhere in that region usually resulting in attacks that are guaranteed to hit their targets. However, some Domain Expansions can also grant their users other, more specific benefits. Here are all the Domain Expansions shown in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime and manga so far ranked from least to most powerful.









 








 13  Yuki&#39;s Domain Expansion 
        

Although she never had a chance to show it off in the series, Yuki Tsukumo&#39;s Domain Expansion was threatening enough to make Kenjaku wary. Yuki was able to control Mass, allowing her to land punishing blows and even create a black hole. This granted her the status of a special-grade sorcerer alongside the likes of Gojo and Geto. Her domain expansion likely would have matched up to this power designation, perhaps letting her get a guaranteed attack on her enemies with the full force of a black hole behind it. Ultimately fans will never know how strong Yuki&#39;s Domain Expansion was, but it still deserves mention when talking about Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest Domain Expansions.





 12  Dagon&#39;s Horizon Of The Captivating Skandha 
        

Dagon didn&#39;t have a lot of screen time during the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen. He is an unregistered special-grade cursed spirit under Mahito who had a similar appearance to an octopus. Under the white cloth that he usually covers himself with, Dagon has muscular arms and a caterpillar-like body. His Domain Expansion is called the Horizon of the Captivating Skandha. Initially, his Domain Expansion was used by his allies like Mahito, Jogo, and Hanami for refuge and rest. When activated, his domain expansion takes the form of a relaxing and calm beach with tranquil waters.
After evolving into a Cursed Spirit, Dagon&#39;s domain was then used against the Jujutsu sorcerers Maki Zenin, Kento Nanami, and Naobito Zenin. Despite having a calm domain, Dagon can create shikigamis in the Horizon of the Captivating Skandha that can automatically hit his enemies. Though Dagon&#39;s Horizon ranks low among Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest Domain Expansions, it&#39;s still a serious force to be reckoned with.





 11  Yorozu&#39;s Threefold Affliction 
        

Yorozu is a very powerful curse user who unfortunately didn&#39;t get much time before Sukuna killed her. However, in the few chapters she appeared, Yorozu demonstrated her cursed technique quite well. Her abilities focused on constructing objects like armor and weapons based around insects. Her Domain Expansion, Threefold Affliction, is an extension of that, guaranteeing that her constructed attacks hit her opponents once they are inside it. While Yorozu is now gone, she did give a gift to Sukuna before she died, which could imply her technique and Domain Expansion may reappear later in the series.





 10  Hiromi Higuruma&#39;s Deadly Sentencing 
        

Hiromi Higuruma is a defense attorney who decided to participate in the deadly Culling Game and even become one of the top players. Before becoming a jujutsu sorcerer, Hiromi was a noble lawyer who helped those who were wrongly accused, even if their cases were impossibly difficult to defend. Despite being naturally proficient in Jujutsu sorcery, Hiromi&#39;s domain expansion wasn&#39;t activated through rigorous training. He received his domain expansion when his cursed technique was activated thanks to Kenjaku.
Deadly Sentencing takes shape as a small courtroom, and those caught in it must prove to the judge that they are not guilty of the crimes ascribed to them. What&#39;s terrifying with Hiromi&#39;s Domain Expansion is that even he is not aware of the kind of punishment his enemies will receive, whether that&#39;s death or removal of their cursed technique. Hiromi is proof that no Domain Expansion should be underestimated in Jujustu Kaisen.





 9  Naoya Zenin’s Time Cell Moon Palace 
        

After being killed by Maki during her massacre of the Zenin clan, Naoya came back as a cursed spirit in the Culling game, intent on exacting his revenge. The sorcerer&#39;s new form gave him much stronger abilities than he previously had access to, making him fast enough even to outspend Maki. This also granted him a powerful new domain expansion Time Cell Moon Palace, which forced everyone inside it to move at 24 frames per second or else get brutally attacked. While Maki was able to break through the technique given her heavenly restriction, it still is one of the strongest Domain Expansions in Jujutsu Kaisen.





 8  Smallpox Deity&#39;s Graveyard Domain 
        

Smallpox Deity is a cursed spirit summoned by Kenjaku to terrorize the Jujutsu sorcerer Mei Mei and her brother Ui Ui. It has a terrifying appearance due to its mouth which has two large tusks and two muscular arms that are filled to the brim with pox bumps. The Smallpox Deity is incredibly powerful as it was used by Kenjaku to gauge Mei Mei&#39;s power and see if she&#39;s worthy of facing him.
The Small Pox Deity&#39;s Domain Expansion Graveyard Domain traps an opponent inside and guarantees an automatic hit for the user. This Domain Expansion coupled with the Deity&#39;s Gravestone Technique can spell death for even the strongest Jujutsu sorcerers. Being inside the Domain and trapped by the Gravestone technique can fulfill the conditions of the Smallpox Deity&#39;s powers and infect the victim with smallpox, leading to their death.





 7  Megumi Fushiguro’s Chimera Shadow Garden 
        

Being a 2nd-grade sorcerer, it&#39;s impressive that Megumi was able to conjure his own Domain Expansion. Though his Chimera Shadow Garden was still incomplete and had its flaw, with the right mindset it can easily exorcise a special grade. Additionally, Megumi is a descendant of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Zenin clan, one of the 3 major sorcerer families and he possesses the sacred Ten Shadows Technique, which can only be inherited and allows him to summon ten different shikigami. Megumi is also able to store sacred weapons in his shadows, which proves invaluable in his fights.
Megumi likely possesses more potential than any other character outside of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s hero, Yuji Itadori. In the series “Cursed Womb” arcs, he is praised for his innate abilities by both Sukuna who is the greatest cursed spirit, and Gojo who is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer. All of this adds up to Megumi&#39;s Domain Expansion having some of the greatest potential in the entire series.





 6  Jogo’s Coffin of the Iron Curtain 
        

Jogo’s Domain Expansion is an extremely powerful technique that summons a gigantic volcano incinerating any average target in an instant. However, while Jogo is a special-grade cursed spirit, his Domain xepansion has little effect on Yuji and Gojo, leading to it being quickly overwhelmed. Jogo is eager and impatient to fight Gojo, which ultimately leads to his defeat. But this makes him the only cursed spirit thus far to have faced Gojo directly alone and survived. Jogo is also one of the more intelligent cursed spirits.





 5  Hakari’s Idle Death Gamble 
        

Hakari&#39;s Idle Death Gamble may be the most confusing Domain Expansion in Jujutsu Kaisen but it is also one of the most powerful. Idle Death Gamble takes the form of a giant Pachinko machine that gives Hakari different bonuses and attacks based on what he spins. Getting a jackpot with this technique grants Hakari a brief period of time when he has access to nigh-infinite Cursed Energy, which essentially makes him invincible. After that period ends he can then initiate Idle Death Gamble again and start the whole process over. This ability to infinitely recur its technique is what makes Idle Death Gamble one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest Domain Expansions.





 4  Mahito’s Self-Embodiment of Perfection 
        

In Mahito’s fight against Yuji and Nanami, fans got to witness his growth in real-time, culminating with the release of his Domain Expansion. Mahito is already more dangerous than the average special-grade cursed spirit as his touch he can alter his target’s soul. Mahito ranks high among Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest Domain Expansions in spite of being a newer and more immature cursed spirit. While younger and less experienced than Jogo, Mahito is an unregistered Special Grade cursed spirit and is assessed to possess the power of at least three of Sukuna&#39;s fingers.
Even before his Domain Expansion, Mahito’s natural ability is a one-hit knockout, which makes his domain expansion incredibly powerful. Fans are also clamoring for Mahito to get a focus episode due to his sheer ability and power, as well as his backstory. If not for Yuji’s intervention, Mahito’s Domain Expansion would have easily killed a Grade 1 sorcerer like Nanami.





 3  Kenjaku’s Womb Profusion 
        

Kenjaku still hasn&#39;t fully shown the power of his Domain Expansion Womb Profusion, but the little he has revealed has already made it one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s scariest Domain Expansions. Womb Profusion seems to not require a barrier just like Sukuna&#39;s Malevolent Shrine and the sure hits it can deal to those within its range hit with all the force of Kenjaku&#39;s most powerful curse Uzumaki. While it has only been used briefly in the series so far, it will likely be shown off more as the series dives deeper into its final battle.





 2  Sukuna’s Malevolent Shrine 
        

As the King of all Curses, Sukuna enters Jujutsu Kaisen without competitors. In fact, other cursed spirits’ strengths are perceived in terms of numbers of Sukuna’s fingers which only demonstrates his overwhelming power. Mahito could be considered one of the bravest characters in Jujutsu Kaisen when he attempted to touch Yuji and inadvertently Sukuna. He has superior abilities and power over all other curses and most sorcerers.
Sukuna was originally a human sorcerer who was so powerful that he was thought to be a demon. All of the sorcerers of the time had to combine their strength in order to defeat him, but Sukuna&#39;s power was so resistant that he was reborn as a cursed spirit and his body was too durable to be destroyed. Mahito and Jogo spend the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen plotting to get on Sukuna’s good side and return all of his fingers. In the first cursed womb battle, Sukuna reveals his Domain Expansion and instantly defeats the special grade cursed spirit that overwhelmed Yuji and Megumi.





 1  Satoru Gojo&#39;s Unlimited Void 
        

Gojo is not only a likable character due to his charm and looks — but he&#39;s also extremely powerful. He is introduced in the series as “the strongest” and later confidently boasts that defeating a fully revived Sukuna would be “a little draining.” Throughout the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen, every intelligent cursed spirit is advised to avoid Gojo and there&#39;s good reason for that.
Like Megumi, Gojo possesses several inherited techniques such as Six Eyes, which allows his cursed energy usage to be near-infinite, and Limitless, which gives him control over space. In addition to these innate abilities, Gojo was also born with high intellect and superior strength, speed, and reflexes. In its reveal, Unlimited Void is so powerful that it renders the cursed spirit Jogo in a state of complete paralysis.
Part of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s appeal is the complex nature of its power system. The Domain Expansion is a complicated technique that makes any fight that much more interesting. While not every character has access to one, those that do rank among Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest characters. Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest Domain Expansions truly do represent the park of power.
