# Pokémon Confirms Ash s Return... With One Big Caveat


## SUMMARY 



  Ash&#39;s departure from the Pokemon anime doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t return, as the executive director suggests it&#39;s only &#34;a matter of time&#34; before he and Pikachu reappear.   Ash is seen as &#34;forever 10 years old,&#34; implying that if he does come back, he will remain the same age, not as an adult.   While Ash&#39;s return to the Pokemon Horizons anime may not happen soon, it would be a big deal and likely overshadow the new protagonists, so the creators would want to establish them first.

## Literature Review

An interview with the anime&#39;s director suggests that fans haven&#39;t seen the last of Ash and Pikachu, which has some major implications for the reboot.




The Pokémon anime has been in its closing episodes in recent weeks, preparing to send Ash off and introduce a new generation of trainers aiming to be a Pokémon Master. However, even before he&#39;s out the door, there&#39;s word that Ash won&#39;t be gone for good.




According to an interview in the Japanese magazine Otomedia, as picked up by comicbook.com, executive director of the Pokémon anime Kunihiko Yuyuama suggested that it was only &#34;a matter of time&#34; before Ash and Pikachu appear in Pokémon again following their departure. Yuyuama also stated that he sees Ash as being &#34;forever 10 years old,&#34; implying that should Ash appear again, fans should expect to see him more or less as he&#39;s always been, rather than as an adult.


 Pokémon Still Refuses to Age-Up Ash 
          

It may seem premature to discuss Ash&#39;s return, but even the possibility raises some interesting points. Firstly, it confirms that Pokémon Horizons is set in the same world as the original, meaning that many other characters besides Ash (for example, Pokémon&#39;s Team Rocket) could appear, possibly well before Ash does. Yuyuama&#39;s comment on Ash being &#34;forever 10 years old&#34; also quashes a number of fan theories about Horizons protagonists Liko and Roy potentially being the children of Ash or other characters, or of Ash having a mentor-like role as an older character in the series, similar to other anime sequel series like Boruto or Yashahime. If Ash interacts with Liko and Roy, it will be on the same level as them, just one young trainer to another.




Of course, these statements are not promises or indications of anything solid; it&#39;s simply a general insight into the mindset of the Pokémon anime&#39;s creators. It&#39;s likely that Ash won&#39;t appear in Horizons for quite some time. Ash&#39;s appearance in the Pokemon Horizons anime would likely overshadow the new protagonists, which is absolutely not what the creators would want when these characters are still being established. Whenever he does finally appear, though, fans can expect his return to be quite a big deal.



 How Long Should Pokémon Wait Before Bringing Ash Back? 
          

Ash still holds a place close to the hearts of many fans, and there&#39;s no shortage of posts online wondering when or if Ash will return. Before Ash himself could appear in the series, there would have to be a reason to justify his inclusion; simply encountering Ash on the road wouldn&#39;t be very interesting or satisfying. It also seems likely that the creators will want to give Ash some time to rest, which gives time for hype to build around his possible return. It may be well over a year, or perhaps even two, before there&#39;s a real possibility of Ash&#39;s return to the Pokémon anime.




As fans say goodbye to the classic Pokémon anime and Ash and Pikachu along with it, knowing that the door is open for Ash&#39;s return may make that farewell a little easier. Ash may no longer be on Pokémon each week, but he&#39;s still out there adventuring, and the show will catch back up with him someday.
