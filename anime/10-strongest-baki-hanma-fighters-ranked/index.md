## Literature Review

With a series built on strong characters such as Baki, it&#39;s hard to pick who is more powerful, but some of these fighters clearly stand at the top.





While Baki and his personal journey are the main focus of the franchise, they are often outshined by a great cast of unique characters, all powerful fighters and martial arts masters. All of them are driven from a desire to prove their worth, test themselves against stronger opponents and ultimately reach the pinnacle of their violent world. As these characters are always training and progressing it&#39;s hard to rank them precisely in terms of strength, but their fights in the series help in that regard.

Please note that this list only considers the first three manga series, Grappler Baki, New Grappler Baki, and Baki: Son of Ogre, which were adapted into the anime Baki the Grappler, Baki, and Baki Hanma.









 








 10  Kaiou Kaku 
        

Considered the strongest of the Kaiou and the Supreme Grandmaster of Chinese Kenpo, Kaiou Kaku is the oldest character of this list, having reached the impressive age of 146. He is considered a living legend in Chinese martial arts, and despite his age he has proven to be almost unbeatable. After training for most of his younger years in a traditional way, seeking strength and power, Kaku realized the true secret of Chinese martial arts lies in &#34;weakness&#34;, making one&#39;s body so relaxed and flexible that it can absorb any attack with no damage.
Kaku&#39;s impressive mastery of this technique, called Xiaoli, allows him to fight almost on par with Yujiro Hanma, even taking two of his full-strength punches with no effect. However, Yuujiro ultimately easily overwhelms the technique and defeats Kaiou Kaku with ease. Despite his impressive experience and knowledge of Chinese Kenpo, Kaku has also a stubborn mindset that, along with his age, prevents him from progressing further in the path of martial arts, thus putting him one step behind the younger fighters in the series.





 9  Kaiou Retsu 
        

Another practitioner of Chinese Kenpo, Retsu was considered a true prodigy since his youngest age, and has dedicated his entire life to Chinese martial arts. With a younger, more powerful body and an open mindset, Retsu has likely surpassed Kaiou Kaku, even if the tw never fought directly. Retsu has also shown a willingness to learn and test himself in different environments, as highlighted by his friendship with Katsumi Orochi, the time spent in the Shinshinkai dojo, and his stint as a boxer in America.
Despite his incredible skills, Retsu has lost two very important fights. The first was against Baki in the semifinals of the Maximum Tournament in the Underground Arena, proving that even the 4,000 years of Chinese martial arts are no match for the demonic Hanma blood. The second was against Pickle and it ended up in Retsu losing a leg, which inevitably diminished his fighting abilities.





 8  Katsumi Orochi 
        

The adoptive son of the God of Karate, Orochi Doppo, Katsumi is a young prodigy who was chosen by his father for the impressive athletic skills he demonstrated since he was a kid acrobat in a circus. Despite his great genetics and the privilege of training under the strongest karateka in the world, Katsumi&#39;s growth has often been impaired by his arrogance, but he has grown and evolved after taking on the duty of guiding Shinshinkai, and more importantly after his fated battle against Pickle.
In fact, while Katsumi lost against Retsu in the Maximum Tournament, the incredible technique he displayed during his battle against Pickle puts him above his Chinese friend. Using Baki&#39;s trademark &#34;imagination technique&#34; to imagine that his body is made of thousands of joints, Katsumi delivers Hitless Blow, a strike that breaks the sound barrier and was able to knock the mighty caveman back, something that Retsu failed to do. Unfortunately, this also inflicts incredible damage on Katsumi&#39;s limbs, and he ended up losing an entire arm to Pickle.





 7  Doppo Orochi 
        

Known as &#34;the God of War&#34;, &#34;Man Eater&#34;, and &#34;Tiger Slayer&#34;, Doppo is the strongest practitioner of karate in the world, the grandmaster and former head of the Shinshinkai school. Doppo perfectly represents all the values of traditional karate, but he is also considered a dangerous and deadly man. Doppo is known for practicing each of his techniques at least one thousand times each day, and his style of karate relies on brute force delivered quickly and with accuracy to the opponent&#39;s weak spots.
Doppo is one of the very few people in the world who could give Yujiro Hanma a decent fight. During their second match (the only one shown in the series, happening in the first manga and anime series), Doppo even pushed Yujiro back, forcing him to activate his &#34;demon back&#34; before crushing the karate master and gouging his left eye. Despite being officially &#34;retired&#34;, Doppo has started his training again from the basics, proving that a true karateka will never stop growing stronger.





 6  Gouki Shibukawa 
        

This practitioner of Aikido and Jujitsu ranks higher than Doppo only because he won their fight during the Maximum Tournament, but these two old masters are very close in terms of power. Shibukawa is also considered a living legend, and he is in charge of training for the Japanese police and security forces. His greatest asset is his master of Aiki, a technique capable of redirecting the force of an attack back. Despite his small frame, Shibukawa&#39;s style is based on flips, holds, and submission moves that can knock down even the largest opponents.
While Aiki can be incredibly effective, it&#39;s ultimately a defensive technique, so Shibukawa has to always wait for the opponent to make the first move. Also, as his loss against Jack proved, particularly skilled or powerful fighters can find a way around Aiki and overwhelm Shibukawa. However, this old master still has the heart of a warrior and he keeps improving and challenging himself despite his age.





 5  Jack Hanma 
        

Easily considered a twisted reflection of his half-brother Baki, Jack&#39;s obsession for surpassing Yujiro led him to rely on everything possible to get stronger, including drugs and excruciating bone-elongating procedures. What makes Jack really stand out is that, contrary to most other fighters on this list, his desire to become stronger is not hindered by any type of morals, code, or qualms, which makes him perhaps the most &#34;pure&#34; character in the series. Jack&#39;s trademark technique, biting, proves that concept better than anything else.
Jack got to the finals of the Maximum Tournament by literally walking over a master such as Shibukawa, which proves his great power. Jack is not only stronger and taller than most his opponents due to the drugs, surgeries, and crazy training regime, he also has the Hanma&#39;s innate attitude for fighting, as shown when he effortlessly copied Aiki. However, Jack still lost against Baki, and was then humiliated by Pickle, proving that there is a glass ceiling he&#39;s been unable to break through.





 4  Biscuit Oliva 
        

The actual strength of Mr. Oliva, aka &#34;Unchained&#34; is hard to assess, due to his unconventional fighting technique and the fact that he has never faced most of the characters on this list. However, he is still strong enough to impress Yujiro, and to receive special treatment from the Government of the United States, which also keeps him under constant watch. Oliva&#39;s main asset is, of course, his superhuman strength, as he can punch people through concrete walls. Oliva&#39;s muscles can become as resilient as steel, able to repel even bullets and swords.
However, Oliva also has a keen intellect and is not lacking in technique, as proved when he threw Shibukawa during a Judo match (even if the master dislocated his wrist in the process). Oliva&#39;s greatest weakness, perhaps, is the &#34;love&#34; he has for his muscles and his overconfidence in his strength. He lost a straight punch-out with Baki, and he would also lose in terms of raw strength to both Pickle and Yujiro.





 3  Baki Hanma 
        

The protagonist of the series, Baki is obviously the character that has grown most during the story, reaching the peaks of the martial arts world. First motivated by the desire to avenge his mother, killed by Yujiro, Baki finally gets to accept his father for who he is, and through his martial arts path he becomes not just stronger, but wiser and more balanced. Through daily training and intense battles, Baki has assimilated a lot of styles and finally developed his own, which emphasizes speed and precise strikes, but he can also rely on his Hanma blood.
Baki has some of the most creative and impressive techniques in the series, including his Cockroach Dash that allows him to reach the speed of a Bullet Train. He is also incredibly adept in using his imagination for training - to conjure strong opponents to shadow box against - and even in fights, as with his Triceratops Fist. However, Baki still lost against Pickle, even if he forced him to use a technique. It could be argued that Baki foolishly tried to fight Pickle head on at the end, giving up his technical advantage, but at the same time the fact that Pickle only needed to imitate one martial arts technique to put down Baki proves the difference between the two.





 2  Pickle 
        

Pickle is a prehistoric man from the Cretaceous era that was found perfectly preserved in a saline rock formation, and was revived in the modern age by scientists. The most impressive thing about Pickle is that he used to hunt and eat dinosaurs, including the fearsome T-Rex. He is completely different from modern-day humans, as his body was built to hunt and kill those monstrous creatures. Of course, the fighters of the present can&#39;t wait to test their martial arts against Pickle&#39;s primordial power.
Clearly, Pickle&#39;s main asset are his physical capabilities, which none of his opponents was able to match. After all, Pickle&#39;s body was able to withstand the blows of a Brachiosaurus&#39; tail or the fangs of a T-Rex, meaning that Retsu and Katsumi&#39;s best attacks did not even faze him. Baki managed to do better thanks to his incredible speed and accuracy, rocking Pickle&#39;s brain to give him a concussion. However, Baki still lost, and what&#39;s most impressive is that, at the height of their fight, Pickle used a martial arts technique, proving that if he actually learned how to fight he could be simply unbeatable.





 1  Yujiro Hanma 
        

It would be wrong to consider Yujiro a martial artist: he is simply a man who pursues &#34;strength&#34; above anything else. Blessed by the blood of the Hanma and a natural attitude for fighting, Yujiro is simply the strongest character in the series. While Pickle&#39;s weakness is that he has no technique, Yujiro has raw strength similar, if not superior to, that of the prehistoric man, on top of supreme technique and knowledge of martial arts. Yujiro is so powerful that even the United States pledge alliance and non-aggression with him every time a new President is elected.
His final fight with Baki is controversial because Yujiro recognized that his son made him do the impossible - cook for him - and thus named him &#34;the strongest&#34;, but the truth is that Yujiro was the one standing at the end, and even Baki refuses to accept that victory. Considering that he has proved to be vastly superior to every other character in the series, there is no doubt that Yujiro Hanma is the strongest character in Baki.
The Baki franchise is one of the most exciting and successful in the world of martial arts manga. While the style and themes of the series can hardly be considered innovative, Baki continues to captivate fans more than 25 years after its debut with its emotional battles between powerful martial artists and fighters. The anime adaptations only go as far as the third manga series, Hanma Baki, for now, but in the following ones even stronger characters appear, meaning that fans of the Netflix anime have a lot to look forward to from a future series.
