## Literature Review

Many of the best romances in anime are tragic and heartbreaking, leaving a long-lasting impression on viewers&#39; minds with their bittersweet tones.




Since classics like Romeo and Juliet, audiences have always appreciated a mix of love and tragedy, and the best tragic romances in anime are no exception. True love is rare, but these couples find it and expect to live long and happy lives together. However, they’re doomed to lose each other tragically.
There are many ways for an otherwise perfect relationship to be brought down. The couple can simply not get over personal hang-ups before it’s too late, or the world around them can conspire to keep them apart. Either way, both they and the audience are heartbroken by the end.









 








 10  Kousei And Kaori Bond Over Music 
Your Lie In April


 







Kousei Arima was once the brightest rising star among young pianists, but years of abusive training by his stage mom ground him down, and guilt over her death finally broke him. Shy, insecure, and hurting, he believes he’ll never play piano again. It’s only until he meets Kaori Miyazono, a violinist insistent that he accompany her, that he begins to reenter the world of music.
Your Lie In April is one of those anime doing its best to make you cry. It’s hinted from the very beginning of the show that Kaori’s time with Kousei will be short, but in bonding over music, falling in love changes both of them for the better. Before they’re separated for good, Kaori gets her ultimate performance and Kousei is given his love of music and will to live back.

 9  Otonashi And Kanade Save Each Other’s Lives 
Angel Beats!


 







As Yuzuru Otonashi discovers, the afterlife is a place where he meets and befriends many other lost souls, all overcoming the trauma and regrets of their lives together. He even helps bring Kanade Tachibana, who everyone else had assumed was a supernatural enemy, into the fold. But it’s also a place that everyone is meant to move on from, alone.
Once a soul has come to terms with their unfinished business, they disappear from the afterlife to be reborn. After helping all their friends move on, and discovering the connection they share from their previous lives, Otonashi and Kanade can’t enjoy the love they’ve found: it’s not the right time or place. It’s up to fate whether their souls will find each other in the next life.

 8  Takaki And Akari Always Come  , But Never Confess To Each Other 
5 Centimeters Per Second
        

Makoto Shinkai loves this type of story as much as any of his audience. 5 Centimeters Per Second is perhaps his most grounded and affecting portrayal of such a romance. Unlike pairs like Taki and Mitsuha from Your Name or Hodaka and Hina from Weathering with You, there is nothing supernatural about Takaki Touno and Akari Shinohara. Their story could happen to anyone.
Takaki and Akari were very close in childhood, even sharing each other’s first kiss. However, due to circumstances outside of their control, they become distant and lose touch in adolescence and adulthood. They both come very close several times to admitting how deeply they love each other, but never quite manage to spit it out.

 7  Suzaku And Euphemia Almost Broke Barriers 
Code Geass

        

As an Eleven, Suzaku Kururugi is looked down on and distrusted by the Britannians he serves alongside. The only one who believes in him is Princess Euphemia, who honors his skill and integrity by making him her Knight. Suzaku would have been happy to protect Euphie forever, and perhaps let the affection between them grow deeper, until tragedy strikes.
What continues to horrify and infuriate fans everywhere is how completely unnecessary and avoidable Euphie’s end is. One single careless sentence by Lelouch, who didn’t realize it would activate his Geass, not only sealing Euphie’s fate but condemning her to be remembered as a monster. Suzaku is crushed and consumed with a thirst for revenge against Zero, left with no choice but to continue the violence Euphie so hated.

 6  Hotaru And Gin Can Never Touch 
Into The Forest Of Fireflies’ Light

        

Into the Forest of Fireflies&#39; Light is not available to stream at the moment. 

Many of the best anime based on Japanese mythology delve into the wide world of youkai, spirits or ghosts of folklore and legend. Gin is neither fully human nor fully youkai, being an abandoned child raised by youkai. Still, he forms a close childhood friendship with a human named Hotaru, with a catch: if Gin is ever touched by a human, he will cease to exist.
The story is being narrated by an older Hotaru, with no sign of Gin, so attentive viewers can probably guess where this is going. Still, it’s hard not to be swept up by the deep friendship and love Gin and Hotaru build up over their summers together, which Hotaru makes clear were the best times of her life. While they do eventually get the hug they’ve been yearning for, it comes at a terrible cost.





 5  Spike And Julia Were Never Meant To Be 
Cowboy Bebop
        

On first watch, Cowboy Bebop seems largely episodic, only for the major storylines and themes to all come together by the final act. The core of the show is the heroes’ attempts to move on from their pasts, and the question of whether that’s even possible. For Spike Spiegel, the answer to that question is a solid “no.”
Though this relationship is only hinted at through most of the show and only really comes into play in the final episodes, it becomes central to the climax. In some of Cowboy Bebop’s best episodes, Spike tries to combine the freedom of his new life with the happiness of his old one by reuniting with his old love, Julia. Sadly, attracting the attention of Vicious and the Red Dragon Syndicate spells both their dooms.

 4  Shinji And Kaworu Were Doomed To Fight 
Neon Genesis Evangelion


 







Shinji Ikari’s burning desire for love, acceptance, and self-worth drives him through most of the show. Though Kaworu Nagisa only appears briefly, his sudden entry into Shinji’s life seems, for one hopeful moment, to be what he’s been looking for. He is kind to Shinji without asking anything back, or expecting him to do or be anything to earn it, simply loving him the way no one ever has before.
As such, the reveal that Kaworu is the final Angel, slipped into Shinji’s life specifically to deceive him and destroy his world, is devastating even by Evangelion standards. After all the trauma he’s endured, it’s being forced to fight and kill Kaworu that finally breaks Shinji completely. While the status of Shinji and Kaworu&#39;s relationship is left purposely ambiguous in the story (they could be friends or a lot more), they remain an iconic but tragic couple.

 3  Oscar And André Are Torn Apart By Revolution 
The Rose Of Versailles


Raised as a boy by her father, who was desperate for an heir, Oscar is devoted to her duty to the French royal family. André has adored her since the childhood they spent learning how to fight and ride together. Though the class divide between them widens as they get older, they still care deeply for each other, and Oscar begins to realize she returns André’s feelings.
Unfortunately, in The Rose of Versailles, political intrigue tears what could have been a very happy couple viciously apart. The French Revolution is brewing, and Oscar and André are caught up in the violence right as it explodes. Fighting for their lives and the lives of those they’re sworn to, there’s no chance for them to be together in life.
There is a lost episode of The Rose of Versailles, “Portrait of a Burning Rose,” which focuses entirely on Oscar and André and was meant as the finale in some regions.

Their dismal world gets in the way of their truly becoming a couple, however. First, Guts leaving the Band of the Hawk not only infuriates Griffith but separates the pair.
