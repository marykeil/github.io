## Literature Review

As some of the medium&#39;s most highly rated and recognizable titles, action manhwa come in a variety of flavors, ranging from grounded ones to isekai.




While the manhwa medium certainly has plenty of interesting and memorable experiences to provide for just about anyone, regardless of preferred genres or themes, action fans are particularly lucky in this regard. After all, the best action manhwa also happen to be some of the medium&#39;s best and most well-known titles overall, which only proves their quality and widespread popularity.
As an emphasis on action does not necessarily restrict authors creatively in any way, titles that fall under this category vary greatly, whether in terms of theme, setting, or anything else. Some action-packed manhwa specifically focus on engaging and dynamic fights with supernatural foes that only get more creative throughout the story, in line with the progression of the protagonist, while others may overlap with the popular reincarnation trend that seems to truly resonate with both the creators and fans of this medium.









 








 10  SSS-Class Revival Hunter (2020) 
Based on the Novel by No-Ah Shin, Written by Neida, &amp; Illustrated by Bill K
        

The Tower appeared mysteriously, seemingly out of nowhere, immediately attracting reckless hunters willing to abandon everything in exchange for taking on its floors&#39; various challenges and monsters, in search of adventures and fame. Gong-Ja Kim has always lived a pitiful life, growing up as an orphan before entering the Tower and being bullied by stronger hunters upon becoming one himself. Envying the elite hunters, the Tower rewards him with a skill that allows him to copy abilities, at the cost of his own death, which ironically marks the beginning of his new life.
Thanks to its various skills, creative martial arts, and fantastic art that only improves throughout the series, SSS-Class Revival Hunter delivers a worthwhile experience for fans of action titles. Moreover, while this title&#39;s setting and premise may make it seem like a typical dungeon-based power fantasy, it gradually reveals itself to be much more than that, by thoroughly exploring the world&#39;s setting and developing other intriguing characters, making it one of the most underrated manhwa overall.

 3  Eleceed (2018) 
Original Series Written by Jae-Ho Son &amp; Illustrated by Hye-Jin Kim
        

In the world of awakeners, people with supernatural abilities, most people join special organizations, that guarantee their safety and provide certain benefits, in exchange for supporting the organization and following certain rules.

This is the case for Ji-Woo Seo, a kind boy with super speed, and Kayden Break, a secret agent on the run who becomes Ji-Woo&#39;s mentor.
Eleceed features plenty of well-choreographed and easy-to-follow, engaging, and impactful fights, but its strengths extend far beyond the incredible action alone.
