  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>As some of the medium&rsquo;s most highly rated and recognizable titles, action manhwa come in a variety of flavors, ranging from grounded ones to isekai.</p>
<p>While the manhwa medium certainly has plenty of interesting and memorable experiences to provide for just about anyone, regardless of preferred genres or themes, action fans are particularly lucky in this regard. After all, the best action manhwa also happen to be some of the medium&rsquo;s best and most well-known titles overall, which only proves their quality and widespread popularity.
As an emphasis on action does not necessarily restrict authors creatively in any way, titles that fall under this category vary greatly, whether in terms of theme, setting, or anything else. Some action-packed manhwa specifically focus on engaging and dynamic fights with supernatural foes that only get more creative throughout the story, in line with the progression of the protagonist, while others may overlap with the popular reincarnation trend that seems to truly resonate with both the creators and fans of this medium.</p>
<p>10  SSS-Class Revival Hunter (2020)
Based on the Novel by No-Ah Shin, Written by Neida, &amp; Illustrated by Bill K</p>
<p>The Tower appeared mysteriously, seemingly out of nowhere, immediately attracting reckless hunters willing to abandon everything in exchange for taking on its floors&rsquo; various challenges and monsters, in search of adventures and fame. Gong-Ja Kim has always lived a pitiful life, growing up as an orphan before entering the Tower and being bullied by stronger hunters upon becoming one himself. Envying the elite hunters, the Tower rewards him with a skill that allows him to copy abilities, at the cost of his own death, which ironically marks the beginning of his new life.
Thanks to its various skills, creative martial arts, and fantastic art that only improves throughout the series, SSS-Class Revival Hunter delivers a worthwhile experience for fans of action titles. Moreover, while this title&rsquo;s setting and premise may make it seem like a typical dungeon-based power fantasy, it gradually reveals itself to be much more than that, by thoroughly exploring the world&rsquo;s setting and developing other intriguing characters, making it one of the most underrated manhwa overall.

Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Li-Na Lim</p>

However, when dangerous mixed-blood vampires begin to threaten the world, she has no choice but to team up with Eun-Tae Hwang, a talented police detective, to identify and take out the source of her troubles.
Following a powerful protagonist driven by revenge, Unholy Blood&rsquo;s focus lies on well-drawn, dynamic, and engaging action scenes. Naturally, these scenes are enhanced by the vibrant art style, which truly brings the entire experience to life. Beyond the emphasis on action lies an endearing romantic subplot, which should appeal to fans of romance titles as well.

<p>8  Weak Hero (2018)
Original Series Written by Seopass &amp; Illustrated by Jin-Seok Kim</p>
<p>In Eunjang High School, strength is everything. Weak students are constantly bullied by the strong, and no one dares defy this natural order. That is, until the mysterious Gray Yeon suddenly arrives, immediately standing up to bullies twice his size and defeating them with ease. Despite his small stature and average physical strength, Gray continues to overpower tough opponents by fighting strategically, relying on his knowledge, and making use of his environment to gain the upper hand.
Weak Hero is a truly exciting action-packed title, revolving around creative and surprisingly captivating fights. However, as impressive as the fighting scenes may be, this is certainly not everything the title amounts to. The characters are interesting, realistic, and well-developed, and the dramatic story is intricate and grounded, immersing readers into its world and impacting them emotionally.

<p>7  Noblesse (2017)
Original Series Written by Jae-Ho Son &amp; Illustrated by Gwang-Su Lee</p>
<p>While Cadis Etrama di Raizel may look no different from an ordinary human, he is in fact a &ldquo;Noble&rdquo;, belonging to an ancient race characterized by superhuman skills and nearly eternal life spans. Awakening after an 820-year-old slumber, Rai finds a world where everything is foreign to him. With the aid of his loyal servant, Frankenstein, he enrolls in a local high school, in an attempt to learn about and adapt to modern society. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to him, a secret organization known as &ldquo;The Union&rdquo; is planning to investigate and make use of his powers.
Noblesse features an abundance of well-executed action scenes, enhanced not only by the characters&rsquo; creative abilities, but also by the vibrant artwork and the overall direction of fights, which will often have readers on the edge of their seats. Additionally, this title&rsquo;s story and characters are likewise intriguing and captivating, thanks to the intricate worldbuilding and supernatural elements. There is also a decent amount of well-timed comedy, caused by Rai&rsquo;s inability to deal with modern technology.

<p>6  Leviathan (2018)
Original Series Written by Kyung-Tak Lee &amp; Illustrated by Mi-Young Noh</p>
<p>When sea levels rise high enough to fully cover the continents, the planet is no longer ruled by humans, but rather by fearsome sea monsters. While most people live in terror, the bravest become harpoonists, risking their lives fighting deadly monsters to protect what&rsquo;s left of humanity. However, even the strongest harpoonists can hardly stand up to the threat of the titular &ldquo;Leviathans&rdquo;, apex predators who evolved after the catastrophe. Yet Bo-Ta&rsquo;s family continues to survive and fight back, while mentored and protected by the mysterious Kana.
While some may understandably be put off by the occasionally excessive amount of &ldquo;fanservice&rdquo; and gore, those who don&rsquo;t mind it are certain to find an enjoyable experience in this title. Leviathan thrives on electrifying battles and breathtaking visuals, making it an unmissable title for action fans. The story and characters are also intriguing in their own right, albeit admittedly simple.

<p>5  Tower of God (2010)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by SIU</p>
<p>When Rachel, Baam&rsquo;s one and only friend, suddenly disappears into the Tower to pursue her wish, he follows her without hesitation. Determined to reunite with his friend, Baam sets out to ascend the Tower, despite being unprepared for its many threats and obstacles. Each floor is managed by an &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;, who is in charge of providing harsh challenges that often involve fighting monsters or other climbers. Only those who boast both natural strength and the ability to control shinsu can reach the top floors and become &ldquo;Rankers&rdquo;.
While the action may occasionally prove difficult to follow, Tower of God&rsquo;s fighting scenes remain incredibly creative and mesmerizing, combining engaging martial arts with interesting powers, all aided by artwork that only continues to improve. However, what sets this title apart is its complex and intricate story, featuring various characters and factions that are rarely outright good or bad, instead having their own complex morality and motivations.
Tower of God&rsquo;s highly anticipated second anime season is set to release in July 2024.</p>

<p>4  Solo Leveling (2018)
Based on the Web Novel by Chu-Gong, Written by Hyeon-Gun, &amp; Illustrated by Seong-Rak Jang</p>
<p>When &ldquo;Gates&rdquo; suddenly start appearing, connecting the human world to magical and dangerous dungeons, it is up to the &ldquo;Hunters&rdquo;, ordinary humans who receive extraordinary powers, to clear them and protect humanity. As one such hunter, Jin-Woo Sung hunts monsters without rest, to pay for his family&rsquo;s bills. Although he is initially extremely weak, struggling against even the easiest dungeons, Jin-Woo is eventually selected as the &ldquo;Player of the System&rdquo;, granted unique skills and the ability to level up without limits.
Featuring a protagonist who continuously evolves, both in terms of abilities and battle techniques, Solo Leveling provides some of the medium&rsquo;s most thrilling action scenes, aided by dynamic artwork and masterful use of effects. The story and characters may not impress every reader, with some finding them slightly generic, but they are still serviceable and do not detract from what is otherwise not only a splendid action title, but also one of the best fantasy manhwa.
Solo Leveling&rsquo;s Crunchyroll anime adaptation is set to release in January 2024.</p>

<p>3  Eleceed (2018)
Original Series Written by Jae-Ho Son &amp; Illustrated by Hye-Jin Kim</p>
<p>In the world of awakeners, people with supernatural abilities, most people join special organizations, that guarantee their safety and provide certain benefits, in exchange for supporting the organization and following certain rules. Some awakeners, however, prefer to remain independent, not affiliating themselves with any organization, despite being judged more harshly for this. This is the case for Ji-Woo Seo, a kind boy with super speed, and Kayden Break, a secret agent on the run who becomes Ji-Woo&rsquo;s mentor.
Eleceed features plenty of well-choreographed and easy-to-follow, engaging, and impactful fights, but its strengths extend far beyond the incredible action alone. While the story may not be particularly unique, its uncomplicated nature allows it to seamlessly combine action, comedy, and drama scenes, all brought to life by amazing characters and fantastic artwork.</p>
<p>10 Best Manhwa on Webtoon
Webtoon has a little of something for everyone with well over a million titles to choose from. Here are 10 of the best manhwa on the platform.</p>
<p>The artist behind Eleceed previously worked on other popular titles, such as Girls of the Wild&rsquo;s and Nineteen, Twenty-One.</p>

<p>2  Omniscient Reader (2020)
Based on the Web Novel by Sing-Shong, Written by UMI, &amp; Illustrated by Sleepy-C</p>
<p>Dok-Ja Kim is a man with an unfortunate life, whose sole source of comfort is reading. He is specifically passionate about Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse, authored by tis123, an apocalyptic fantasy web novel that follows a protagonist who must regress in time over and over to deal with various deadly challenges known as &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo;, thus preventing the end of the world. Although this novel is initially popular, Dok-Ja is the only one to read it to the end, after which the novel becomes reality, forcing him to reluctantly play the role of the protagonist.
Although Omniscient Reader is a spectacular action-packed title, it offers a lot more than simple disjointed fights without a purpose. From the intricate story to the complex characters and the stunning artwork, this title provides a complete experience that never feels lacking in any dimension. Everything about it is polished to near perfection, making it not only a great isekai manhwa, but also a worthwhile title for any fan of the medium.
Omniscient Reader&rsquo;s original creators also authored The World After the Fall, another similar web novel that was adapted into an enjoyable manhwa.</p>

<p>1  Wind Breaker (2013)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Yong-Seok Jo</p>
<p>Having lived his whole life burdened by his parents&rsquo; rules and expectations, Ja-Hyeon &ldquo;Jay&rdquo; Jo was never allowed to do anything other than study. Denied even the simple concept of having friends, as they were deemed too much of a distraction, he always focused on his studies, becoming a straight-A student and the student body president of his high school. However, inspired by his late uncle, Jay also developed a passion for cycling and biking, which attracts the attention of the Hummingbird Crew, thrusting Jay into a whole new world.
Unlike other action titles, Wind Breaker revolves not around fights, but rather around competitive, adrenaline-inducing, high-octane races. Featuring artwork that greatly improves throughout the story and compelling, well-developed characters, this title tells a beautiful story of friendship, passion, and growth, that even fans with no knowledge of cycling are sure to enjoy. As such, it is not only one of the best action manhwa, but also an outstanding experience for any reader.
