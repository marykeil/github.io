# Boruto s Disrespect For Sarada Is Even Worse In the Anime


## SUMMARY 



  The Boruto manga implied that Sarada&#39;s early problems with the Sharingan were due to her father&#39;s prolonged absence, but the anime fixed that by showing many training sessions with Sasuke.   However, this means that the anime portrays Sarada as an ineffective kunoichi, because she can no longer blame her father&#39;s absence for her shortcomings.   While the Boruto anime usually fixes some of the manga&#39;s issues with the portrayal of certain characters, this is sadly not the case for Sarada&#39;s issues with the Sharingan.

## Literature Review

The Boruto anime might usually do a better job at portraying characters than the manga, but not in the case of Sarada and her Sharingan.




In comparison to the anime, the Boruto manga&#39;s failure to fully flesh out certain characters normally reflects poorly on their overall characterization, but there&#39;s one instance in the anime where the extra time Sarada receives actually casts her in a worse light. In this instance, the manga&#39;s lack of context initially proved that Sasuke was a bad father because he failed to teach his daughter how to use the Sharingan, but the anime portrays Sarada as an even more ineffective kunoichi.




In both the anime and manga, Kawaki can instruct Sarada on how to effectively use her clan&#39;s Sharingan against their opponent Boro after just learning about the technique moments earlier. On the surface, Kawaki&#39;s ability to one-up Sarada reflected poorly on her, but since the manga never showed her father Sasuke with her, there was the impression that it was actually Sasuke&#39;s fault.

          

As her father and an Uchiha, it was Sasuke&#39;s duty to teach her, but he failed because he was never there for her. However, the anime includes multiple scenes where Sasuke trains her on how to effectively wield the Sharingan, meaning that Sarada&#39;s sequent failure falls entirely on her shoulders.

The fact that Sarada trains with Sasuke for multiple episodes (from #168 to #200) demonstrates that Sarada had more than enough training to know how and when to use the Sharingan. So when Kawaki later tells her how she can use the Sharingan in episode #207 reflects poorly on her as a shinobi and an Uchiha. Fans can no longer blame Sarada&#39;s failure on her father for not being there, since he spent numerous episodes training her.

Ironically, episode #206 completely retconned a similar event from the manga for Sarada&#39;s benefit. In the manga, Mitsuki asks Sarada to use her Sharingan to help them identify Boro&#39;s Dark Mist. The anime just sees Mitsuki coming to the conclusion himself after collecting a few samples during the battle. Although especially savvy anime-only viewers might have realized that Sarada could have helped with her Sharingan, at least the anime doesn&#39;t call out Sarada directly.

Regarding Sasuke, he might be portrayed as a better father as a result of the anime&#39;s additional scenes where he trains his daughter, but it&#39;s unfortunate that it had to come at the expense of Sarada. This is especially the case since she, along with most female shinobi in both Naruto and especially Boruto, are unnecessarily belittled or forced to participate in unfortunate and outdated tropes that portray females less favorably than their male counterparts. Sarada definitely receives less ridicule than other characters like Hinata, but that doesn&#39;t warrant the need to disrespect her more.

Overall, the Boruto anime usually does a better job of treating female characters like Sarada with respect and even call out the manga&#39;s worst traits, but this case is definitely an unfortunate exception.
