 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode #12? 
          




In Undead Unluck episode #12, “Activate”, the Negator who was set to be auctioned off, Chikara Shigeno, attempted to use his Negator ability, Unmove, to escape from his guard, but the problem was that Unmove only works while Chikara isn’t moving, and with him being scared to the point of shaking, he couldn’t use it to get away. Rip i.e. Unrepair killed the guard, and the Negator Hunters then proceeded to try and kill Chikara and make Unmove transfer to someone else, but fortunately, Andy was able to protect Chikara and announced his intention to have Chikara join the Union.

Andy and Rip started fighting over Chikara, and their fight soon fell into a stalemate, with Andy using Undead to work around Unrepair and Rip using Latla’s Negator ability to avoid Andy’s attacks. However, things took a turn for the worse when Fuuko was stabbed by Rip while protecting Chikara, giving her a permanent wound with only an hour to live unless they kill Rip and deactivate Unrepair. The Negator Hunters left as some more guards arrived, and Chikara, determined to save Fuuko, stopped the guards with his first efficient use of Unmove in the episode, thus giving Andy a chance to chase after Rip and save Fuuko.






 Undead Unluck’s New Villains Are The Exact Opposite Of The Heroes 
          

While Undead Unluck’s Negator Hunters have yet to be fully explored, something that’s already been made clear about Rip and Latla is that they’re the exact opposite of Andy and Fuuko. In addition to being on the opposite side and having no interest in fighting God, Rip and Latla are also a male and female pair of Negators who use their powers in tandem to fight, and Rip, specifically, serves as a foil to Andy since Unrepair prevents healing while Undead enforces it. That sort of dynamic is always great to see, and it will be interesting to see how Undead Unluck episode #13 and beyond plays into it.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #13 when it releases on January 5.
