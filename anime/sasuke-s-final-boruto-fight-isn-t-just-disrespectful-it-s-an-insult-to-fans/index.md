## Literature Review

Sasuke&#39;s final stand in the Boruto manga failed to give the character the send-off he deserved or make the villain that took him down intimidating.





Summary

  Sasuke&#39;s final battle in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex #5 is an insult to fans who have followed the character for years.   Having Sasuke lose against Code, the least intimidating villain in the series, is incredibly unsatisfying.   The lack of showing the battle robs both Sasuke and Code of character moments they desperately need.  







Sasuke&#39;s time in the Boruto series has seen the beloved Uchiha fail when most fans expected him to succeed, but his final battle was an insult to fans who&#39;ve followed the character for years. The time skip has turned most of the world against Boruto, whose learned techniques that&#39;d make the Fourth Hokage proud and trained extensively with Sasuke. Unfortunately, one of the manga&#39;s latest chapters proves the series isn&#39;t done making the fan favorite Uchiha Sasuke look bad compared to the ninja he was at the end of Naruto Shippuden.

By the end of the Naruto storyline, Sasuke was considered one of the world&#39;s strongest and most intelligent shinobi. Before he was given the Rinnegan and god-like abilities, the Uchiha could take on an army and many horrifically powerful foes like Danzo and Sage Kabuto. With that being said, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex&#39;s chapter #5 is an embarrassment to Sasuke fans.

          




Having Sasuke lose against Code, the Boruto series least intimidating villain, is an incredibly unsatisfying ending for the beloved character. Still, matters are made even worse because the battle happens off-screen.

                  Naruto&#39;s Rinnegan Explained: How Madara Unlocked Them And Their Powers   Few ninjas in the Naruto universe gained control of the Sharingan, but even fewer obtained the Rinnegan, which is as powerful as it is complex.   


 Sasuke&#39;s Character Deserves Better Than Being Off-Screened By Code 
          

Code has been called the worst villain in the entire Naruto franchise for his shallow character development and overall whiney personality. For a storyline known for having layered and well-written antagonists, Code&#39;s lack of a compelling backstory or intimidating abilities is annoying because the series writers have proven capable of much more. Fans have been told but not shown that Code is strong. By showing Code and Sasuke&#39;s battle, the manga could have given both characters time to show readers what they are made of, making these two seemingly important characters easier to feel invested in.




The chapter revealed that during the series&#39;s three-year time skip, Boruto was trained by Sasuke until they somehow got into a fight with Code. Boruto&#39;s flashback revealed Sasuke&#39;s final moments before being captured, which involved the student and teacher fighting Code and several of his Claw Grime creatures. Still, very little of the exchange is shown in the manga. Code and his creatures haven&#39;t shown skills or strength that Sasuke hadn&#39;t encountered or properly dealt with before, especially throughout the Shippuden&#39;s events. It&#39;s incredibly disappointing that not only was he defeated by the lacking Boruto villain, but readers don&#39;t even see how the battle played out, robbing both characters of character moments they desperately need.



 The Boruto Series Has Given Fans Little Reason To Fear Code Or Respect Sasuke 
          




Both Code and Sasuke have been given few opportunities to impress audiences in the last few arcs. The reputation of each character is often spoken about in the series, but their strength is not shown, making them challenging to fear or root for. Long-time franchise fans know what Sasuke is capable of without his Rinnegan eye. The manga would have significantly benefitted by showing the two characters&#39; battle over a few pages. Showing more of Code and his creature&#39;s abilities would make them more intimidating. Plus, since it&#39;s likely his final battle in the Boruto series before he is revived and made even more obsolete, seeing Sasuke go all out could have given his character the justice he deserves.

Like Naruto, Sasuke is not really dead but has been captured. By getting rid of Naruto and Sasuke, the story can more effectively focus on the growth of Boruto and the sequel series characters like Sarada and Kawaki. While the Shōnen series will likely have a happy ending that brings Sasuke and Naruto back, Sasuke&#39;s prominent role in the franchise institutes the character deserved a better sendoff than what chapter #5 provided. Hopefully, when the Boruto anime adapts the material, fans will be able to see Sasuke&#39;s last stand with an extended fight that gives the character and his abilities a finale showcase fans know the Uchiha is capable of.
