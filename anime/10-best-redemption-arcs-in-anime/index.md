## Literature Review

Villains making the journey to heroes are some of the best stories in anime, as seen in Dragon Ball, A Silent Voice, and Vinland Saga.





As a villain’s reasons for being evil are unpacked, their path to becoming a hero becomes clearer. Whether they just needed someone to show them love and another way to be or had to be put through the wringer before choosing to do the right thing, their turns are equally interesting to watch.









 








 10  Osamu Dazai - Bungou Stray Dogs 
        

When Atsushi and the audience first meet Dazai, he seems like a carefree (even careless) and cheerful guy: the one big clue that he’s got deeper issues under the surface is his obsession with suicides. Later, it’s revealed that Dazai was once a prized member of the Port Mafia. As a mafioso, he was merciless to his enemies and allies alike.
However, he was very close with his fellow mafioso, Sakunosuke Oda, who held ideals of mercy and kindness despite his profession. When Odasaku is killed, his last words to Dazai urge him not to keep going down his dark path, and to stay “on the side that saves people.” Dazai takes his words to heart for the rest of his life, leaving the Port Mafia for the Armed Detective Agency and working to protect Yokohama instead.





 9  Shouya Ishida - A Silent Voice 
        

One of the best coming-of-age anime movies is also a feature-length redemption arc. As a child, Shouya took part in bullying his deaf classmate, Shouko Nishimiya, and was made the sole scapegoat when they were caught. The withdrawn and self-loathing teenage Shouya can only achieve the redemption he craves by reaching out to others, despite how badly the prospect terrifies him.
Naturally, Shouko is the first person Shouya tries to reconnect with. As they grow closer, the relationship not only helps Shouya move forward, but allows the sensitive and compassionate Shouko to let go of the blame and self-hatred she has also been carrying for years. The two of them ultimately find happiness in each other and their friends, wholeheartedly encouraging each other to keep living to the fullest as well.





 8  Meruem - Hunter X Hunter 
        

Not all of the Chimera Ants follow Meruem, as their species usually do when a King is born, but none of them want to cross him. He kills on a whim, cares nothing for anyone but himself, and quickly sets about taking over a country and starting a world domination plan. However, Meruem is just as capable of change as anyone else.
Through his relationship with Komugi, Meruem begins to recognize and respect the virtues of humanity. Even if he can’t quite shake his nature — he informs Netero that instead of eating humanity, he will dominate them all justly — he does the best he can with the experience he has. By his and Komugi’s final scene, in one of Hunter x Hunter’s saddest episodes, he shows softness and tenderness his newborn self could never have conceived of.





 7  Thorfinn - Vinland Saga 
        

The child of retired Viking warrior Thors, Thorfinn only admires his father’s power, not understanding the horrors that made Thors choose a peaceful life over battle. When Thors is murdered by the mercenary Askeladd, Thorfinn vows revenge. He grows up with Askeladd’s band of Vikings, nursing his grudge and fighting to become strong enough to kill Askeladd the way he believes his father should have.
Thorfinn’s journey begins as one of the best revenge plots in anime, but doesn’t pan out at all the way such tales usually do. Years of hatred and fruitless efforts turn him into a bitter shell of his former self, and the end of his quest drives him to rock bottom rather than satisfy him. To get back up and become a true warrior, he must rediscover the values that his father tried to impart to him before he died. This leads to Thorfinn&#39;s incredible transformation into one of the few true pacifists in manga and anime.





 6  The Generation of Miracles - Kuroko’s Basketball 
        

Full-scale redemption arcs are rare even in the antagonists of the best sports anime, with their natural tendency to move quickly from one opponent to the next. If anyone changes their unsportsmanlike ways, it’s typically the hero’s single rival. Kuroko’s middle school teammates neatly fit into both categories.
The Generation of Miracles was unsurpassed, but Kuroko was horrified by how cruel they became to weaker players on the court. Separated into their high school teams, they all represent hurdles Kuroko has to overcome to assert his own style of basketball. Kuroko’s love of the game and seamless teamwork with Seirin reminds them of their gentler days and inspires them to change: by the “Last Game” they and Kagami are defeating an arrogant American team with perfect teamwork.





 5  Gaara - Naruto 
        

It might have been nice to see more of Gaara’s development from one stage to another: finding out that he’s gone from village pariah to Kazekage is one of the most rewarding and feel-good moments in Naruto. But the magnitude of difference from his first appearance to his most recent ones is enough for him to qualify. Ostracized and abused as a child for being Shukaku’s host, Gaara resolved to love only himself and spend his life slaughtering.
Fighting fellow jinchuuriki Naruto, the first person he’s ever met who can fully understand him, shakes his worldview severely. Realizing that another way of living is possible for him, Gaara begins trying to connect with other people for the first time. He is monumentally successful: he becomes close with his siblings, loved by the Sand Village enough to be made Kazekage in just two years, and, in Boruto, the adoptive father of Shinki.





 4  Bakugo Katsuki - My Hero Academia 
        

Bakugo Katsuki began his story as something much worse than a villain: a bully. Despite Deku&#39;s adoration for him, Bakugo quickly started bullying his &#34;best friend&#34; after he found out that he did not have a Quirk. Hearing that Deku will still try to enter U.A. High, Bakugo becomes even angrier and ruthlessly mocks Deku, only to have his life saved thanks to his intervention at the beginning of the story.
Bakugo&#39;s redemption, however, would be a long time coming. While he slowly but surely comes to accept Deku as his peer, he will not admit his wrongdoings or even apologize, until one of the best scenes in My Hero Academia. When all of class 1-A comes together to bring Deku back after he ran away, Bakugo finally shares his feelings, admitting he had always been jealous of Deku&#39;s determination and finally apologizing for his past behavior.





 3  Crona - Soul Eater 
        

Especially considering the fate of poor Crona in the manga, anime Crona’s journey to freedom and self-confidence is even more heartening. Their entire life, they were under the control of their evil mother, the witch Medusa, used as a tool and experiment. When Maka touches their soul and offers them her friendship, it’s the first time that anyone has treated them with care.
Realistically but unusually for the standard redemption arc, Crona does experience a relapse, manipulated by Medusa into poisoning their DWMA professor. But they’re determined to make amends for what they’ve done and stay with their new friends. Not only do they gather the courage to defy their mother, but they continue to face their many fears one day at a time.





 2  Teruki Hanazawa - Mob Psycho 100 
        

As Mob meets more Espers, he learns that not everyone keeps such tight control over their psychic powers, or uses them for noble pursuits. Teru believes that his powers put him above everyone and let him do whatever he wants. After he and his hair suffer a devastating defeat from Mob, Teru does some serious rethinking of this attitude.
Though his overinflated ego remains, much to his new friends’ annoyance, he accepts that he is still just a regular person even with his powers, and resolves to treat others more like Mob does. Fortunately, he’s still just as strong, putting his prodigious abilities into helping his friends and protecting others from much worse Espers than he used to be.





 1  Vegeta - Dragon Ball 
        

Vegeta is one of the most famous villains-turned-heroes in anime history. First arriving on Earth as part of Frieza Force, he quickly becomes one of the planet’s most fearsome enemies; even after turning on Frieza, he is still fueled by fury at losing to Goku. But when he realizes that his ego and tunnel vision are doing more harm than good, both to him and the people he’s growing to care about, he accepts that he must change.
Ultimately, Vegeta achieves the peaceful life he has by getting out of his own way. Once he lets go of his obsession with becoming stronger than Goku, he is free to pursue a new path outside of the brutality he was raised in. While he still has his monumental pride to get a handle on, he is now not only a devoted husband and father, but among Earth’s most powerful and ferocious protectors. After so many years, Vegeta&#39;s redemption still feels genuine and it set up the stage for many similar characters in the future.
Watching villains become heroes is one of the best parts of being an anime fan. While it has become a recurring trope in the medium, it still works as effectively as the first time in creating compelling characters. Redemption stories are a big part of why anime is so successful, as these characters&#39; journeys feel both triumphant and inspiring to viewers.
