## Literature Review

Romance anime had a fantastic year in 2023, with a variety of series that push the stereotypes of the genre while providing great entertainment.




2023 was an amazing year for romance anime. Popular series like My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999 and Yuri Is My Job! might have been so beloved for a reason, but put the true romance on the back burner. Some series like Endo and Kobayashi Live! might deconstruct popular otome and &#34;villainess&#34; Isekai while others like Our Dating Story might tear down tropes, but when up against long-running series like Rent-A-Girlfriend, they fall short.
Ironically, some returning series were negatively affected by just how powerful their debut seasons had been, like Tonikawa: Over the Moon for You. Besides these honorable mentions, other romance anime of 2023 managed to hit all the right spots and give fans a great experience, proving that the genre is alive and well.









 








 11  Kubo Won’t Let Me Be Invisible Features &#34;Softly Aggressive&#34; Cuteness 
Based on Nene Yukimori&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch it   HIDIVE    
The creative ways in which Junta Shiraishi can&#39;t be seen are what draws viewers to Kubo Won&#39;t Let Me Be Invisibile, but it&#39;s Nagisa Kubo&#39;s persistence in successfully making him a part of her life that stands out. Although she&#39;s sweet and speaks lightly, Kubo is an enigmatic anomaly because she&#39;s somehow softly aggressive in how she puts Shiraishi into positions that force him to say or do things to bring them closer together.
It&#39;s especially heartwarming when her efforts are for his benefit alone, like helping him uncharacteristically make friends. Shiraishi&#39;s invisibility might be portrayed as a gimmick and might even feel almost supernatural in how only certain types of people can see him or after certain conditions have been met, but it still serves as a stunning metaphor for his duality of wanting to be seen and even overlooked.

 10  The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses Is Actually Quite Nuanced (Despite The Title) 
Based on Koume Fujichika&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   13    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
Like Kubo Won&#39;t Let Me Be Invisible, this series is based on a gimmick. It&#39;s all about how Ai Mie usually forgets her glasses at home, forcing her to sit closer to her desk mate and secret admirer in class, the shy and timid Kaede Komura. This goofy premise results in the two of them getting into cute situations like her having to get right in his face so she can see his expressions.
Even though this gives a fresh spin to the common romance trope where the forward girl flabbergasts the shy boy by having no boundaries, the series explores the absurd basis of their relationship in innovative ways. In fact, there are actually days when she doesn&#39;t forget her glasses, which causes conflicting feelings to arise in Komura and Mie as they want to be close to each other without having to rely on Mie&#39;s eponymous accessory.

 9  The Dangers in My Heart Uses Morbidity To Accent Love 
Based on Norio Sakurai&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch it   HIDIVE    
For some, this series&#39; dark premise of a potentially violent boy falling in love with the happiest, most ditsy girl served as an initial draw-in factor. Although it allows the series to ironically portray &#34;good&#34; students as being more twisted than an ostensibly horrible person, it quickly fades when The Dangers In My Heart starts to subvert male and female stereotypes.
Anna Yamada is unnaturally tall, while Kyotaro Ichikawa is quite short, especially by comparison, which puts them in unique situations that completely deconstruct the usual tropes. Some might find Kyotaro&#39;s voyeuristic tendencies to be unnerving, but his in-depth commentary gives further insights into his inner struggles as he begins to compare how he feels in relation to how ostensibly &#34;normal&#34; students act.

 8  Tomo-chan is A Girl! Is The Gender-Bender That Wasn&#39;t 
Based on Fumita Yanagida&#39;s four-panel manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   13    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
This series stands out for the simple reason that it tackles the same tropes and nuances of the best gender-benders without the protagonist actually having to get their gender switched. Tomo Aizawa is just a very masculine girl who has a crush on her guy friend and love interest, Junichiro Kubota, who is first utterly clueless and then in complete denial of her gender.
Tomo-Chan Is A Girl!not only explores Kubota&#39;s journey in coming to terms with the truth, but also the eponymous Tomo-chan&#39;s struggle of whether she should become more feminine to get Kubota&#39;s attention.

 7  Rent-A-Girlfriend Season 3 Continues To Expand (&amp; Get More Heartbreaking) 
Based on Reiji Miyajima&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12 of 36    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
Rent-A-Girlfriend is a typical anime rom-com that just continues to masterfully explore the anguish of Kazuya Kinoshita (and by extension, Ruka Sarashina) as he can&#39;t help but involve himself in the life of his love interest and eponymous rented girlfriend, Chizuru Mizuhara, even though she is adamant about keeping their relationship professional. Although the series doesn&#39;t try to be innovative, Rent-A-Girlfriend&#39;s third season throws a couple of curve balls. Another girl named Mini Yaemori just happens to move in next door to Kazuya, who takes it upon herself to get him closer to Chizuru by forcing them into awkward situations.
This embellishes the new premise that the season two finale introduced, where Kazuya becomes Chizuru&#39;s unofficial movie director to help her achieve her dream. Although Chizuru still won&#39;t confess her love for Kazuya like almost every rom-com, the more prominent role of her grandmother almost assures her feelings, even beyond Chizuru&#39;s intense expression in the season two finale.

 6  Ayakashi Triangle Is What All Gender-Benders Should Aspire To Be 
Based upon Kentaro Yabuki&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
Although Ayakashi Triangle is controversial due to the amount of censorship it received, it&#39;s still a great example of what the gender-bender genre offers. It might feature a stereotypical curse that causes the male hero Matsuri Kazamaki to change genders, but rather than being superficial, Ayakashi Triangle gets quite nuanced in how it explores gender and identity.
The series delves into deep topics that underscore the positives of the gender-bending curse, like how Matsuri appears as a boy in another&#39;s dream who knows him as a girl, which must mean that he is still a boy at heart, and the fact that Matsuri has made friendships for the first time since becoming a girl. There&#39;s also Suzu&#39;s open-mindedness towards Matsuri becoming a girl even though she&#39;s in love with Matsuri the boy, which suggests she&#39;s gender-blind.

 5  My Clueless First Friend Is The Innocence Everyone Needs 
Based on Taku Kawamura&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   13    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
In what could easily be dubbed as a more innocent version of Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You, this series&#39; true appeal is the kindness that recent transfer student Taiyō Takada shows the wrongfully identified &#34;cursed&#34; Akane Nishimura. Of course, the series&#39; fun gimmick is how Takada&#39;s utter cluelessness prevents him from fathoming how their classmates could view Nishimura negatively. Therefore, he always misconstrues all their mean-spirited taunts towards her as compliments, much to their eternal chagrin.
Part of this amusing absurdity is Takada&#39;s ostensible belief and awe that Nishimura could actually be cursed (and his hope to one day be so). On a deeper level, the fact that both Nishimura and Takada are so young allows the anime to portray their relationship innocently, which naturally subverts the many tropes that this show explores in its own way.

 4  The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague&#39;s Cold Humor Can Thaw Every Frozen Heart 
Based on Miyuki Tonogaya&#39;s manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
This Josei&#39;s true charm comes from the dryness of both the cool female colleague Fuyutsuki-san and ice guy Himuro-kun, as these two emotionless lovers explore their feelings for each other in a workplace setting. It&#39;s rare to have a series starring two love interests who are so similar, but it works because of how humorous their matter-of-factness is. However, Himuro-kun&#39;s inner monologue is quite expressive, and he normally gets overly excited while talking to himself, which offers much-needed divergence.
Of course, those who are not romance aficionados will be drawn to Himuro-kun&#39;s supernatural powers. Aside from there being some twisted undertones, these abilities prove that shonen tropes can improve romance anime as they are driven by Himuro&#39;s feelings and even serve as metaphors.

 3  The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten Ups the Ante of Rom-Coms 
Based on Saekisan and Hanekoto&#39;s light novel series
        

  elease Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
Just like most anime rom-coms, this series is the epitome of the &#34;do they actually like me?&#34; trope. However, the unique situation of both characters puts them in overly intimate predicaments that not only jettison their experiences but completely deconstruct the budding romance between friend-zoned love interests in most rom-coms. What starts off as Mahiru Shiina&#39;s desire to take care of her hopeless next-door neighbor, Amane Fujimiya, soon evolves into them basically playing house intimately.
They are essentially a married couple except for not actually being in a relationship. This absurd situation is underscored by how Shiina is also completely innocent and naive. She always asks for things that can be easily misconstrued in the most devastating ways for Fujimiya, who continues to wonder if the most beautiful girl in school can actually love him.

 2  My Happy Marriage Is So Wonderful Because of How Happy It Is 
Based on Akumi Agitogi and Tsukiho Tsukioka&#39;s light novel
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch it   Netflix    
Although clearly a Japanese twist on the Cinderella story, how the two main characters initially approach their sudden engagement put their happily ever after at risk. Miyo had been mistreated so badly that she was overly submissive, to Kiyoka&#39;s annoyance, and Kiyoka Kudou initially treated her coldly because he was jaded by the shallowness of his other fiancées.
The anime&#39;s true appeal begins when Kiyoka eventually realizes how badly Miyo was treated as he attempts to make her as happy as possible. The moments when Miyo can&#39;t believe his kindness towards her or her own happiness are overwhelming just because of how much it affects her.

 1  Don&#39;t Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro 2nd Attack Is An Attack On Viewers&#39; Hearts 
Based on Nanashi&#39;s web manga
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   12 of 24    Where to Watch it   Crunchyroll    
As the title for season two implies, Hayase Nagatoro does very much initiate the second phase of her onslaught on poor Naoto Hachiouji aka &#34;Senpai,&#34; but things get much milder. This allows the series to put more of a focus on Nagatoro&#39;s true feelings, as opposed to how much she tortures her Senpai. In addition to how this season&#39;s &#34;judo arc&#34; humanizes Nagatoro by giving her hopes and dreams, the series highlights what would be a major moment for any anime rom-com: Nagatoro&#39;s stunning confession to Senpai when he&#39;s asleep.
Meanwhile, their friends&#39; heartfelt attempts to salvage their relationship reach new heights in the season finale, even though it&#39;s based on a ridiculous misunderstanding. Overall, Don&#39;t Toy With Me Miss Nagatoro manages to be more adorable than most romantic comedies, while at the same time playing with its own formula successfully, making it one of the best romance anime of 2023.
