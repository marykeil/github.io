## Literature Review

The landscape of anime has changed a lot over the past decade, but there are 10 anime from 2014 that still more than hold up after so many years.




The landscape of anime has certainly changed a lot since 2014, but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn’t any good anime to watch from a decade ago. Even though an entire decade has passed, there are plenty of great anime from 2014 that are still actively producing new content after 10 years, and even for those that finished their stories, they ended up leaving such a big impact on people that they’re still held in high regard after so many years.
While much of what&#39;s popular after ten years has largely stayed the same, there&#39;s been a definite change in viewing habits. Isekaiand short-length anime, for example, have both gained notable popularity, and with how much streaming has taken off, watching anime is the easiest it&#39;s ever been in years. Still, these gems from 2014 are proof that the legacy of good anime can last for a long time.
        










 








 10  Prisma Illya&#39;s Sequel Was When The Series Finally Started To Find Its Footing 
Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 2wei!, produced by Silver Link
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   20    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, HIDIVE    
A great anime that premiered in 2014 was Silver Link&#39;s Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 2wei! This was the second season of Prisma Illya, and while Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 2wei! hadn’t completely eschewed the goofiness and raunchiness it premiered with, it was here that the anime started to take on more serious and better-written story material that would eventually lead to the genuinely engaging narrative of future installments. Overall, 2wei! laid the groundwork for Prisma Illya to evolve into one of the best installments of the Fate franchise, and with the series still receiving new content a decade later, it’s clear how successful that was.

 9  Unlimited Blade Works Gave Fate/Stay Night The Anime It Deserved 
Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, produced by Ufotable
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   25    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Coincidentally, 2014 also saw the premiere of another Fate anime, Ufotable’s Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, and it was also a great series to watch. With its incredible art, animation, soundtrack, and overall direction, not only was Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works a perfect follow-up to Fate/Zero, but it more than succeeded at finally giving Fate/stay night a high-quality adaptation after Studio Deen’s work on the franchise proved to be middling at best. Unlimited Blade Works helped to cement Ufotable as one of the best anime studios around, and it’s incredibly easy to see why that is.

 8  Amagi Brilliant Park Perfectly Embodied What Makes Kyoto Animation Special 
Amagi Brilliant Park, produced by Kyoto Animation
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   13    Where To Watch It   HIDIVE    
For something that served as a one-off series, another great anime that premiered in 2014 was Kyoto Animation’s Amagi Brilliant Park. From start to finish, Amagi Brilliant Park prided itself on being a goofy series with occasional moments of genuine heart, all of which was conveyed with the usual stellar art and animation of Kyoto Animation, and that made it one of the best anime to watch in 2014. Amagi Brilliant Park might not be one of the more famous productions by Kyoto Animation, but it still had plenty to offer and was a great addition to an already stacked year of anime.

 7  No Game No Life Is Still One Of The Best Isekai Anime 
No Game No Life, produced by Madhouse
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   12    Where To Watch It   Disney&#43;, Hulu    
No Game No Life truly stood out thanks to its unique art and animation style courtesy of Atsuko Ishizuka, and with an engaging premise surrounding games and a growing cast of unique and interesting characters, No Game No Life still stands out as one of the best isekai anime to have come out even after a decade. The series has rather infamously never received a second season, only a prequel film several years later, but that doesn&#39;t detract from how great a series it is, in the slightest.

 6  Yuki Yuna Proved That It Was More Than A Madoka Magica Clone 
Yuki Yuna Is A Hero, produced by Studio Gokumi
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   37    Where To Watch It   HIDIVE    
The success of Puella Magi Madoka Magica led to many new magical girl anime trying to cash in on its success, and one of the few that made it work in 2014 was Studio Gokumi’s Yuki Yuna Is a Hero. Despite the similarities between them, Yuki Yuna Is a Hero managed to separate itself from Puella Magi Madoka Magica thanks to having great art and animation and for being far more idealistic than other anime like it, even having a mostly happy ending. Thanks to that, Yuki Yuna did a great job of justifying its existence, and with the franchise still going strong, it’s clear how well that’s been working.

 5  Space Dandy Was A Bold Experiment That Went Perfectly Right

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   26    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Funimation    
One of the first anime to premiere in 2014 was Studio Bones&#39; Space Dandy, and it more than managed to set the year off on a high note. As is often the case with projects from both Shinichiro Watanabe and Shingo Natsume, Space Dandy never failed to sell itself as a wonderfully surreal anime with great animation and art that always complemented every bizarre scene, making it one of the best anime made by either director. Space Dandy was also notable for premiering in English before premiering in Japanese, and with how good of an anime it was, that practice was more than warranted.

 4  Haikyu!!&#39;s Anime Showed Why The Manga Is So Great 
Haikyu!! by Production I.G


 







  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   85    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll    
Haruichi Furudate&#39;s Haikyu!! was one of the biggest manga in Weekly Shonen Jump during its eight-year run, and the 2014 anime by Production I.G shows exactly why. Just like the manga, the Haikyu!! anime always got to the core of what makes sports stories so exciting with its tense rivalries, great characters, and overall stellar execution of the sport itself. The impeccable direction of every season always made it one of the best anime to watch whenever it was airing. The anime is set to conclude with two movies, starting with one in February 2024, and they&#39;re sure to be a fitting finale to such a great anime.

 3  Parasyte -the maxim- Gave The Classic Series A Much-Needed Update 
Parasyte-the maxim- by Madhouse
        

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   24    Where To Watch It   Hulu, Crunchyroll    
Modern retellings of older stories are incredibly common, and a great example of that with anime in 2014 was Madhouse&#39;s Parasyte -the maxim-. The series was the first adaptation of the manga almost 30 years after its first release. Not only did Parasyte -the maxim- do a great job of adapting the manga with excellent animation and direction, but its modernization of the technology, character designs, and even some story beats managed to elevate things to an even higher level. Thanks to that, the series had no problem standing out against more modern shows, and the Parasyte franchise has been a big hit ever since.

 2  Sailor Moon Crystal Finally Allowed The Story To Be Told Right

  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   39    Where To Watch It   Netflix, Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Another modern retelling of an anime that premiered in 2014 was Toei Animation&#39;s Sailor Moon Crystal. As iconic as the original Sailor Moon was, it, like many long-running anime of the time, it was plagued with poor pacing and inconsistent handling of the source material. Sailor Moon Crystal offered fans a new version of the anime more accurate to the manga, even down to the character designs, and with no filler to drag things down, either. The success of Sailor Moon Crystal led to it being continued through multiple seasons and films, and if anything, it’s done the best job of keeping the franchise relevant after so many decades.

 1  JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Finally Entered Its Most Iconic Installment 
JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, produced by David Production


 







  Release Year   2014    Number Of Episodes   48    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix    
While the JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure anime was always good, JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders redefined shonen forever. It introduced Stands, the most iconic part of the franchise, and the anime did an amazing job of conveying how much the action would evolve in terms of choreography, creativity, and overall scale. Stardust Crusaders helped make JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure the mainstream hit it always deserved to be, and that, in turn, helped make it one of the best anime to have premiered in 2014.
