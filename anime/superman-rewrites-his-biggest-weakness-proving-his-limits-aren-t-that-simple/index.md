## Literature Review

Superman has several notable Achillesâ€™ heels, but a fight with a powerful and upgraded Bizarro reveals the true extent of one iconic vulnerability.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1061!There are a lot of ins and outs when it comes to Superman&#39;s powers, but a new feat reveals that his weaknesses aren&#39;t always what they seem. An old antagonist returns to the DC Universe with a dramatic upgrade, forcing the Man of Steel to confront one of his most infamous limits.




In Action Comics #1061 by Jason Aaron and John Timms, Superman&#39;s backward nemesis Bizarro is on a rampage, frustrated by the disappearance of Bizarro World. He crashes on the Sorcerer&#39;s World where he&#39;s inundated with spells until Bizarro becomes a powerful magic user.

          

Six weeks later, Bizarro attacks Earth, intent on turning it into a new Bizarro World with high-level magic. Clark and Bizarro fight when Bizarro suddenly opens up a powerful vortex, which starts to consume him. Despite the immense pain it causes Superman, he flies into the magical maelstrom to try and retrieve Bizarro. Superman stands at the entrance of the magical vortex to save his enemy, but the arcane gateway tears Bizarro apart.


 Superman Just Withstood a Destructive Magic Gateway 
          




Despite his immense power, even Superman has his limits. While yellow solar rays imbue Clark with godlike strength, Kryptonians have numerous weaknesses. Kryptonite and its many variants are the most well-known, as is red solar radiation, which makes Clark as weak as an average human. Magic is also one of his most iconic vulnerabilities. Spells, mystic energies and other supernatural phenomena can easily bypass Superman&#39;s strengths and make it so Clark is easily defeated. It&#39;s not to say that Clark is more weak to magic than other people, but a well-skilled magic user can easily go toe-to-toe with Superman.

Many may think that when magic comes around, Superman has no chance of succeeding. And to a degree, that&#39;s true as magic is something that Clark has struggled with in the past. But unlike Kryptonite or red solar rays, magic doesn&#39;t inherently defeat Superman, it just makes things extremely difficult. The narration is quite vivid in its description of the agony Clark is experiencing in the vortex. But his rescue attempt proves that magic isn&#39;t an end-all-be-all for Superman. Granted, Bizarro&#39;s use of magic could have done more damage to Superman had Bizarro known what he was doing. But even then, this moment proves that magic isn&#39;t as much of a problem for Superman as fans may think.






 Superman Can Survive Magic (But Not Forever) 
          

There&#39;s no doubt that magic can be effective against Superman as it doesn&#39;t need to abide by the laws of the DC Universe. But this moment shows that despite its reputation, magic isn&#39;t the devastating force to Clark that people might think. Sure this experience with Bizarro wasn&#39;t exactly pleasant, but Superman managed to survive it, even as it was causing him a tremendous amount of pain. Kryptonite and red solar rays are effective because they prey on Clark&#39;s distinct physiology. But magic is so loosely defined, it&#39;s not going to be something that renders him useless. It might bring him some harm, but magic isn&#39;t something that Superman can&#39;t overcome.

Action Comics #1061 is on sale now from DC Comics.
