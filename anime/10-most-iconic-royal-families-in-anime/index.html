The Crystal Tokyo Royal Family from
Sailor Moon Crystal
is iconic, with beloved characters like Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask.
The Saiyan Royal Family from
Dragon Ball
is perhaps the most iconic and important family in anime, with Vegeta being a complex character jaded by the fate of his family, and the character growth he experiences when losing his royalty status.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Anime has featured many famous characters over the years, including some iconic royal families with colorful characters</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s family is unique, and no two family dynamics are ever the same. While the meaning of the word is different for everyone, at the end of the day, a family always has something that ties them together. Over the years, anime has told several stories, many of which involve different types of family units. However, there is an ever-present fascination with telling stories about royalty.
A royal family in fiction will typically include a ruler and the members of their immediate – as well as their extended – family. Royals are often found in fantasy or historical settings, such as that of Princess Mononoke, where Ashitaka is a prince of the Emishi tribe. Like any other household, a royal family&rsquo;s dynamic can range from tight-knit to dysfunctional, something that is demonstrated by iconic royal families in anime.</p>
