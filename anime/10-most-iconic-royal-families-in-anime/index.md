## Literature Review

Anime has featured many famous characters over the years, including some iconic royal families with colorful characters




Everyone&#39;s family is unique, and no two family dynamics are ever the same. While the meaning of the word is different for everyone, at the end of the day, a family always has something that ties them together. Over the years, anime has told several stories, many of which involve different types of family units. However, there is an ever-present fascination with telling stories about royalty.
A royal family in fiction will typically include a ruler and the members of their immediate – as well as their extended – family. Royals are often found in fantasy or historical settings, such as that of Princess Mononoke, where Ashitaka is a prince of the Emishi tribe. Like any other household, a royal family&#39;s dynamic can range from tight-knit to dysfunctional, something that is demonstrated by iconic royal families in anime.
