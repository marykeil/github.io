## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #8 will show what the titular protagonist can do in a fight against the demon that wants to kill her.




After introducing a new set of villains in episode #7, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End is poised to pit its titular character against them in episode #8. This could lead to another one the show&#39;s rare but gorgeously animated fight scenes, which is part of what makes Madhouse&#39;s anime adaptation so great. Even if it doesn&#39;t, it will still be cool to see Frieren and the demons clash, as they are all very fascinating characters.





 What Time Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #8 Releases 
          

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #8 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, October 27. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 27 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 10 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #7? 
          

In episode #7, Frieren, Fern, and Stark come to a town in the Northern Lands that is undergoing peace talks with the demons after a long series of battles. Upon seeing these demon envoys, Frieren attempted to kill them but was stopped by the town&#39;s knights and thrown into a dungeon. Later, the lord of the town attempted to kill the demons as revenge for his son, but they managed to talk their way out of it with a made-up story. As the near immortal Frieren was the only one left who knew their true insidious nature, one of the younger demons headed down to the dungeons and confronted her in her cell, ready to kill her.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #8 Will Show Frieren Fight a Demon 
          

Given the cliffhanger ending of episode #7, episode #8 will likely begin by showing the fight between the demon and Frieren. However, if Frieren is as strong as she says she is then this likely won&#39;t be a very even battle. After the demon dies, this may cause some more tension between Frieren and the lord of the town, who recently committed himself to engage in peace talks with the demon envoys. It could also awaken him to the fact that the demons don&#39;t want peace and cause him to attempt to kill the other envoys. Either way, there is sure to be a lot of conflict with these fascinating new villains as the revolutionary fantasy anime Frieren explores them more.

Now that the demons have been introduced and their true nature has been explained, it will be interesting to see how the series uses them in the future. Given that Frieren and her party are now in the Northern Lands, they are much more likely to continue encountering them even after leaving the town they are currently in. Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #8 will thus set an important precedent of how Frieren deals with these foes that will likely carry on into the rest of the series.




Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #8 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 27, 2023.
