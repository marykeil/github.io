## Literature Review

A foreboding glimpse into the upcoming storyline for John Stewart unfolds in official art, promising Green Lantern&#39;s darkest and most brutal era yet.




DC has unveiled a breathtakingly brutal Green Lantern variant cover that foretells a dark and blood-soaked destiny for John Stewart. This evocative artwork transcends conventional illustration, serving as a portal to the intense and emotionally charged journey that awaits this fan-favorite Lantern. The carefully crafted details hint at Stewart entering his darkest era yet, with each brushstroke whispering of sacrifice, turmoil, and the complexities of heroism.




Artist Rahzzah has created what will undoubtedly be considered one of the best Green Lantern variant covers in the history of DC comics. Specifically designed for Phillip Kennedy Johnson’s and Montos’ Green Lantern: War Journal #7, scheduled for release on March 19, 2024, this variant cover sets the stage for an extraordinary narrative.

Rahzzah&#39;s variant cover features John donned in his blood-splattered Green Lantern suit, wading waist-deep in what seems to be a sea of blood. Rivulets of blood cascade off him into the equally deep red waters, creating a visually striking effect. With closed eyes and a bowed head, John&#39;s posture paints a poignant picture of solemnity. The only interruption in the sea of red is the green glow emanating from his submerged Power Ring, casting an eerie luminescence over the waters. In the background, it becomes evident that John is far from home, surrounded by unfamiliar celestial bodies.

The haunting beauty and devastating essence of this artwork creates an immersive experience, drawing viewers into a foreign world alongside John Stewart. The emotional impact is nothing short of amazing, showcasing the storytelling prowess that a single cover can possess and the profound impact it can impart. It&#39;s truly a regrettable oversight that this masterpiece isn&#39;t the main cover for the issue, as its captivating allure could undoubtedly entice numerous readers to purchase the comic based solely on its cover.
