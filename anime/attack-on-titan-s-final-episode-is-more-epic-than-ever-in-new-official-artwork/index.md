Adam Burke&#39;s presentation of Eren&#39;s final Titan form is notably stunning and eerie, looming as an intensely creepy skeletal mass in the distance. Thomas Von Kummant&#39;s work is also very eerie and luminous, with its focus on Eren, chains, and energy. Kelogsloops art stuns with Mikasa and Eren placed against a celestial and cloudy backdrop. Marguerite Sauvage&#39;s art takes on more of a comic book style in a vibrant display. Jacopo Camagni&#39;s art centers Eren and Ymir Fritz, with an ethereal poster style harkening back to the Titan&#39;s origins. Matt Taylor&#39;s artwork is reminiscent of film posters, showing a fiery and intense battleground with Eren featured at the top.
