## Literature Review

The Pokémon anime loves to give its champions a chance to shine, but which one shines brightest of all? Here&#39;s every champion ranked.




In the world of Pokémon, the title of champion is one of the highest honors a trainer can achieve. It means they&#39;ve been through a tournament against many tough opponents and come out on top, usually time and time again. But when it comes to champions, there are some who stand out even among their peers.
Being a champion doesn&#39;t just mean winning tournaments, though. Many champions take it upon themselves to help keep the peace in their native regions, using the incredible power of their Pokémon to defeat evil wherever it shows itself. These champions are ranked according to some of their greatest deeds, not just how well they&#39;ve done in tournaments. Also included are former champions, characters who held the title at one point in the series but no longer do.









 








 9  Wallace is More into Contests than Battling 
First Appearance: Diamond &amp; Pearl, &#34;Our Cup Runneth Over!&#34;
        

Up first is the former champion of the Hoenn region, Wallace. Wallace is a flamboyant character who was also once a Gym Leader, making him a rare case of a Gym Leader moving up to the champion level. Unlike most champions, Wallace first appeared in a different region from the one he was champion of, in this case Sinnoh, where he was putting on a Pokémon Contest tournament known as the Wallace Cup, in which both Dawn and May participated. By the time of Journeys, Wallace is no longer the champion, but he insists on battling Ash anyway, just for the fun of it. Ash wins mostly offscreen, so Wallace doesn&#39;t offer much evidence of his skill.





 8  Alder Prefers the Ladies to Pokémon 
First Appearance: Black &amp; White, &#34;Ash Versus the Champion!&#34;
        

Alder is the champion of the Unova region during the Black &amp; White anime series. Alder is first introduced hitting on Officer Jenny unsuccessfully and nearly getting himself arrested, so he doesn&#39;t exactly make a good first impression. Still, Alder proved his talent with Pokémon in battles against Ash, where he was able to endure many attacks before finally calling it off and giving the victory to Ash. Alder&#39;s battle against Trip after the Junior Cup is more impressive, where Alder utilizes his Bouffalant&#39;s ability to gain the upper hand and defeat Trip&#39;s Serperior.





 7  Iris is a Dragon Master in the Making 
First Appearance: Black &amp; White, &#34;In the Shadow of Zekrom!&#34;
        

Iris succeeded Alder as the Unova region&#39;s champion, making her the first (and only one) of Ash&#39;s traveling companions to attain the rank of champion. Iris is primarily a Dragon-type Pokémon trainer, and she has some powerful Pokémon at her disposal, such as Dragonite and Haxorus. As one of Ash&#39;s companions, a lot of Iris&#39;s growth as a trainer occurred on screen, so it was satisfying to see her elevated as a champion. In the Masters&#39; Eight Tournament, Iris battled against Cynthia in the first round, and despite a valiant effort, just couldn&#39;t pull out the win. At the very least, Iris proved she belonged there with the other champions.





 6  Diantha Mega Evolves to Victory 
First Appearance: Pokémon XY, &#34;The Bonds of Evolution&#34;
        

Diantha is the Kalos region&#39;s champion, and a master of Mega Evolution with her Gardevoir. Diantha also happens to be a movie star, and spends much more of her time on acting-related tasks than champion-related ones.  Diantha&#39;s battle tactics tend to rely on support moves heavily, and she&#39;s very performative on the field of battle. Still, her skill is beyond question, as she even managed to defeat Lance in the first round of the Masters&#39; Eight before losing to Leon. Diantha provided some much-needed help against Team Flare at the end of Pokémon XY (considered one of the best arcs in the series), aiding Ash and the others in destroying the rampaging creature that Lysandre released.





 5  Steven Stone Forges His Own Path 
First Appearance: Ruby &amp; Sapphire, &#34;A Hole Lotta Trouble&#34;
        

Steven is the current champion of the Hoenn region, having taken the title from Wallace at some point after his first appearance. Like Diantha, Steven is capable of Mega Evolution, particularly with his rare Shiny Metagross. Steven appears more prominently in the Mega Evolution specials and late into XY, where he too helps to defeat Team Flare and prevent Lysandre&#39;s scheme from taking over the world. Steven was Ash&#39;s first opponent in the Masters&#39; Eight tournament, and proved to be a fierce competitor, even if he ultimately lost to Ash. Steven seems to take his responsibilities as champion seriously, and is never afraid to get involved in a situation.





 4  Lance is the Original Pokémon Champion 
First Appearance: Gold &amp; Silver, &#34;Talkin&#39; &#39;Bout an Evolution&#34;


 







Lance is the champion of both the Kanto and Johto leagues, as well as a &#34;Pokémon G-man,&#34; a kind of government official who deals with organizations like Team Rocket. Lance first appears when a shiny Red Gyarados goes on a rampage, which he eventually catches and becomes his iconic partner. Lance also helped to stop Kyogre and Groudon from destroying the Hoenn region when Team Aqua and Magma launched their plan. Lance is a very skilled battler, able to take on multiple opponents at once with only one Pokémon. Lance came in second in the previous Masters&#39; Eight tournament behind Leon, proving his abilities are the real deal.





 3  Cynthia is a Graceful and Knowledgeable Champion 
First Appearance: Diamond &amp; Pearl, &#34;Top-Down Training!&#34;
        

Cynthia is the fan-favorite champion of Sinnoh, and it&#39;s easy to see why when looking at her appearances in the show. Cynthia offered Ash mentor-like advice when they first met, and was a reliable figure when it came to defeating Team Galactic&#39;s evil plans. Cynthia is also capable of Mega Evolution with her Garchomp, and is perhaps the most skilled Dragon-type trainer in the entire series. Her calm and collected demeanor makes her an imposing force on the battlefield, not rattled no matter what happens. Cynthia battled Ash in the second round of the Masters&#39; Eight after defeating Iris, but Ash&#39;s unconventional strategies ultimately gave him the win. Still, Cynthia shouldn&#39;t be underestimated.





 2  Leon is the (Nearly) Undefeated Champion 
First Appearance: Pokémon Journeys, &#34;Flash of the Titans!&#34;


 







Leon is introduced as the undefeated champion of the Galar region, as well as the holder of the title of Monarch of the World Coronation Series, effectively confirming him as the strongest trainer in the world. Leon manages some impressive feats, such as training Eternatus after Goh captured it and helping to stop the Darkest Day. Leon prefers to use Dynamaxing over Mega Evolutions or Z-moves, with his Charizard capable of attaining its special Gigantamax form. Leon remained undefeated until Ash came along, and it&#39;s not known how long he was able to maintain his streak as the Monarch.





 1  Ash is the Toughest Champion of All 
First Appearance: Pokémon, &#34;I Choose You!&#34;


 







Ash Ketchum became champion of the Alola region in its first-ever league tournament, which made him eligible for the World Coronation Series. Ash&#39;s feats are far too numerous to list out here, but he&#39;s aided dozens of Legendary Pokémon, captured rare Pokémon like Melmetal and his Shiny Noctowl, and saved the world on many occasions. Ash brings a well-balanced and competitive team into the Masters Eight, and is able to hold his own against the most skilled trainers out there. Ash and Leon have a lot in common, which made their ultimate battle one of the most exciting the series has ever seen.
               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
