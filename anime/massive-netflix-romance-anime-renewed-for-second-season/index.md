## Literature Review

The supernatural Cinderella story Happy Marriage concluded its first run, but a second season has already been confirmed.





The announcement was made both on the anime&#39;s official X account, and with a celebratory video uploaded to the KADOKAWA Anime Channel on YouTube. While details are scant as to what to expect, it is likely that Kinema Citrus will continue handling the adaptation. The confirmation that Miyo and Kiyoka&#39;s courtship will continue is welcome, though unsurprising given how popular the anime was during the summer season.

 My Happy Marriage Has Plenty Of Story Left For Its Season 2 

 

In the KADOKAWA video, voice actors Reina Ueda and Kaito Ishikawa, who performed as the main characters in the anime, announced the confirmation of Season 2&#39;s production. The official X account also gave a succinct confirmation, simply repeating that Season 2 is being made; past that, both sources were light on further details. At most, Ishikawa teased that new characters might appear in the future. It is safe to assume that Kinema Citrus will be tapped once more to continue making more episodes for My Happy Marriage.

The rapid announcement of a continuation was almost predictable, given how well-received the anime was. &#34;Something for everyone&#34; isn&#39;t hyperbole here, as it mixes a Cinderella-esque rags-to-riches romance with light political intrigue, early 1900s historical fantasy, quality animation, and even well-done fight scenes to ensure all viewers had something to look forward to. Miyo&#39;s struggles to escape her abusive family and connect with her fiancee made her easy to root for, making her a favorite of her broadcast season. All in all, My Happy Marriage knew how to balance its tone, ensuring it could broadly appeal to a large audience.




          

The first season adapted only two volumes of a current total of eight light novels, so Kinema Citrus isn&#39;t short of material to use for their next, or further beyond if fans are so lucky. While Ishikawa played coy, later volumes do provide plenty of new obstacles and antagonists for Miyo and Kiyoka to contend with, such as the parents of the Kudou family, whom the wife-to-be has yet to meet. Hopefully, the next season of My Happy Marriage, whenever it finally arrives, can keep the same deft balance of romance, drama, and intrigue that it managed with these past 12 episodes.

My Happy Marriage is currently available on Netflix.
