## Literature Review

Despite  a years-long build up, the result of the highly anticipated tilt between Boruto and Kawaki has been determined without a punch being thrown.






No one can argue that Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (Part I) did not start out with a bang. On the manga&#39;s very first page, fans are treated to a cataclysmic battle between Boruto - whom fans recognized from his appearances in Naruto - and another youth named Kawaki - who fans would eventually learn is the former Kara member and vessel for Isshiki Otsutsuki.




          

While little else is revealed by the brief glimpse of that future battle, over the next 79 chapters of Boruto, the series planted the seeds to explain why Boruto and Kawaki, who became sworn brothers quickly after their first meeting, are destined to fight in the ruins of Konoha. However, after the three-year time skip that separates Part 1 and Two Blue Vortex, it is clear that if that confrontation were to happen now, Kawaki would have absolutely no chance of winning.

                  Boruto Part 2 Is Finally Keeping The Series&#39; Original Promise   Boruto was originally intended to be a story about the “next generation”, but this is only becoming true now that Two Blue Vortex has begun.   


 Boruto Has Become Stronger Than Ever - While Kawaki Is Stuck 
          




Despite all the emotion and build-up that has gone into crafting the perfect rivalry duel, chapter #3 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex makes it clear that there is a huge gap between Boruto and Kawaki in the present. Boruto&#39;s new Rasengan is an incredibly powerful jutsu that makes use of the chakra of the entire planet, and the young Uzumaki is so confident in the power he obtained in the past three years that he doesn&#39;t see Code - once an unbeatable enemy - as a threat anymore. Meanwhile, Kawaki seems stuck in his old ways, relying on his Karma and body augmentations, to the point that he&#39;s surprised and almost taken out by one of Code&#39;s Claw Grimes.

Outside of his Rasengan, the most obvious indicator of Boruto&#39;s newfound strength is his demeanor. Boruto, who is younger than Kawaki by a few years, now looks like the more mature of the two. He is all business in his return to Konoha, not even allowing himself the time for an emotional reunion with Sarada, the person who literally saved his life at the end of Part I. Boruto&#39;s attitude is very similar to Sasuke&#39;s - especially when confronting and mocking Code - and he seems to have learned a lot from his master during the past three years. Clearly, Boruto is showing that he has the skills and confidence to win against an opponent who a mere three years ago was way above his league.






 Boruto&#39;s Absolute Confidence Means He Has Already Surpassed Kawaki 
          

Kawaki, on the other hand, has not changed a lot. He still rushes into battle without thinking, yells at his allies, and overall does not seem to have evolved a lot as a character. While Kawaki could have surely grown stronger during the past three years, it should be remembered that he is not an actual shinobi. No one in Konoha could teach him how to use Karma better (except Amado, perhaps), and considering Kawaki&#39;s brash and arrogant attitude, it&#39;s unlikely he spent all this time training with the village&#39;s best shinobi to learn ninjutsu. He&#39;s probably still relying on his same old tricks, while Boruto has clearly expanded his arsenal significantly, training with Sasuke and possibly other masters too.

The only proof needed of the difference between the two is Boruto&#39;s reaction after seeing Kawaki: he remains absolutely calm, despite being in an extremely hostile environment, surrounded by enemies. There&#39;s no fear, nervousness, or emotion, just cold, hard practical effectiveness. That is, Boruto does not seem worried, or scared in the slightest of any threat that Kawaki - or anyone else - poses to him. It&#39;s that self-confidence and aura of invincibility that proves Boruto has already beaten Kawaki, meaning that their much-anticipated fight is already over before it begins unless Boruto: Two Blue Vortex finds a way to turn the tables and surprise its readers again.
