## SUMMARY 



  One-Punch Man teases the introduction of a new villain in chapter #195, potentially correcting the disappointment of this villain&#39;s original fight in the webcomic.   The Ninja Village Leader, an incredibly old and mysterious figure, has evil ambitions to take over the world, and his minions seek the deaths of Flashy Flash and Blast.

## Literature Review

One-Punch Man is finally setting up its next villain, and it&#39;s a character who, in the original webcomic, was dealt with off-panel.




Warning: Spoilers for One-Punch Man, Chapter #195One-Punch Man teases the introduction of a new villain in chapter #195, the Ninja Village Leader, but this particular villain had one of the most disappointing fights in the original webcomic. It seems the manga may be on track to right that mistake, however, as it suggests his return is imminent.






Chapter #195 in the Japanese release is the same as Chapter #193 in the English-language release.




In chapter #195, Speed-o&#39;-Sound Sonic is confronted by a (preposterously large) group of ninjas, who all come from the secret Ninja Village which both Sonic and Flashy Flash originally came from. The group is hoping to kill Flashy Flash, and wants to use Sonic to draw him out. They also reveal that this is all part of a much larger plan, brought about by the awakening of their leader, who was left in a coma for 15 years after a confrontation with the #1 hero Blast.

          

When the Ninja Village Leader awakens, the ninja intend to kill Flashy Flash and Blast, and from there proceed to take over the world.





 Saitama vs Ninja Village Leader Could Get A Redo In One-Punch Man 
          

In the original webcomic on which the manga is based, the Ninja Village Leader is touted to be a powerful figure, but the actual fight between him and Saitama takes place entirely off-panel, meaning that readers didn&#39;t get to see any of their confrontation at all. While it makes for a funny bit, in that Saitama beat him so fast it didn&#39;t even last one panel, it&#39;s a rather unsatisfying moment for the narrative. What should&#39;ve been the epic fight at the conclusion of the Ninja Village arc was left as a gag. Now, however, the manga is hinting that it may correct this misstep and actually show the fight between the Ninja Village Leader and Saitama.

The Ninja Village Leader is a rather mysterious figure; he&#39;s said to be unbelievably old, suggesting that he might be a monster of some sort. Obviously, his evil ambitions are nothing new, as that&#39;s what would&#39;ve led him into conflict with Blast in the first place. The other ninjas mention that the Ninja Village itself was destroyed by Flashy Flash, and that this is why they are hunting him. This plan seems to be about far more than just revenge, however.




          

The manga finally adapting this webcomic arc means that there&#39;s at last an opportunity to showcase the fight between Saitama and the Ninja Village Leader properly. After all, this is a character that apparently went toe-to-toe with Blast. There&#39;s no reason he should be wiped out any faster than, say, Boros, or the Deep Sea King, monsters who appeared much earlier in the series. This would also not be the first time that the manga changes elements of the webcomic&#39;s story. After all, ONE is writing both, so any changes he makes will only add to this rich and entertaining story. One-Punch Man may still choose to keep the fight between Saitama and the Ninja Village Leader short, but hopefully fans will finally get a chance to see it unfold in the pages of the manga.
