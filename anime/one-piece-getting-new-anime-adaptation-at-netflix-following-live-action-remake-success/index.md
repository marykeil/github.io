## Literature Review

Eiichiro Oda&#39;s One Piece will be getting a brand-new East Blue-focused anime adaptation at Netflix following the success of the live-action remake.




After the success of the live-action One Piece, Netflix is setting sail to platform another anime series for the franchise. Based on Eiichiro Oda&#39;s 1997 manga, which has over 1,000 chapters and is still ongoing, Netflix&#39;s new show is certainly not the first anime adaptation. The first adaptation has been releasing episodes since 1999 and still has a long way to go before it can finish bringing Oda&#39;s work to the screen.




Despite having only completed one season of its live-action adaptation, Netflix is already interested in developing more from the franchise, besides just One Piece season 2. In a Twitter announcement, Netflix revealed that WIT Studio is in the process of developing a new anime adaptation, titled The One Piece.


 

This series will adapt the East Blue saga, and it will be developed by WIT Studio, which has already worked on Attack on Titan, SPY x FAMILY, Vinland Saga, and DC&#39;s upcoming Suicide Squad Isekai.


 Does One Piece Need Another Anime Adaptation? 
          

One Piece already has an anime adaptation, which has proven to be an extraordinary success. With over 1,000 episodes and 21 seasons so far, it has amassed an extraordinary following, and nearly half of its episodes are already available on Netflix. Both the anime and the live-action show covered the East Blue saga, which begins with the first chapter of the original manga.




Beginning another anime adaptation before the first anime has even been completed is a strange decision, especially given the fact that Netflix is already preparing to platform the One Piece prequel, Monsters. The prequel will be available in January and will cover the great swordsman Ryuma&#39;s story. Because of that prequel, in addition to future seasons of the live-action adaptation, Netflix is already well-positioned for distribution. There is already more content coming from the franchise, making the WIT Studio show somewhat redundant.

Of course, there are benefits to developing a new anime adaptation. WIT Studio is a brilliant group of artists and will have the ability to recognize the complete direction of the franchise. Toei Animation couldn&#39;t do the same, given that Toei&#39;s version of the show began in 1999, just two years after the manga began. WIT may attempt to foreshadow future developments and adapt the manga&#39;s story without needing to rely on filler episodes. Netflix&#39;s new One Piece anime should progress more smoothly, even if its overall purpose is questionable.
