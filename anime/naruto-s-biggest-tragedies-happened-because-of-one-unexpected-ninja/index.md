# Naruto s Biggest Tragedies Happened Because Of One Unexpected Ninja


## SUMMARY 



  The Third Hokage&#39;s trust in corrupt advisors allowed tragedies to unfold in the Village Hidden in the Leaves, like the Uchiha Clan massacre and the rise of the Akatsuki.   Danzo&#39;s appointment to the Council was a grave mistake, as his ruthless behavior and alliance with enemies caused numerous atrocities and threats to Konoha.   The Third Hokage&#39;s failure to be discerning in his advisor selection led to the appointment of corrupt councilors like Danzo, Homura, and Koharu, resulting in horrifying events that could have been prevented.

## Literature Review

The Third Hokage, through inaction and bad judgment, indirectly caused many of Naruto&#39;s worst tragedies by appointing corrupt leaders to his Council.




Throughout the iconic manga series Naruto, the beloved Village Hidden in the Leaves suffered countless tragedies, like the massacre of the Uchiha Clan and the razing of the village by Pain. There was a huge systemic failure on the part of one of Konoha&#39;s leaders that allowed many of these tragedies to occur, with the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi surprisingly behind many of these failings.




The Third Hokage is one of the most revered and respected leaders in all of Naruto&#39;s history, retiring to allow Naruto&#39;s father Minato to become the Fourth Hokage, and once again leading the people of Konoha after the tragic death of Minato. However, because of Sarutobi&#39;s inaction, naive trust in those around him, and lack of transparency, the Third Hokage allowed a small group of corrupt individuals to control the future of Konoha, which led to many of the worst events in Naruto history.


 The Third Hokage Put His Trust In The Wrong People 
          

Every Hokage appoints a group of wise advisors to the Konoha Council, or Konoha Go-Ikenban, to support the village&#39;s leader in making tough but necessary decisions during both peace and wartime. The Third Hokage appointed three people to the Council who all worked under the Second Hokage, a man whom Sarutobi greatly respected. These three leaders - Homura Mitokado, Danzo Shimura, and Koharu Utatane - are all brilliant strategists and politicians, but it became clear over the course of Naruto that their Draconian views on punishment and lack of compassion made them terrible leaders who were easily corrupted, leading Sarutobi astray time and time again.




Many horrific events happened to the Village Hidden in the Leaves, but one of the most traumatic and impactful was Itachi Uchiha massacring his entire clan. Eventually, it was revealed that this slaughter was facilitated and pushed by Danzo and that both Homura and Koharu supported this violent conclusion, opposing Sarutobi&#39;s requests for continued peace. Even though Sarutobi removed Danzo from the Council after he directly disobeyed the Hokage&#39;s wishes, he still kept on Homura and Koharu who continued to offer terrible advice to him that would negatively impact the village for years to come.



 Appointing Danzo To The Council Was A Terrible Mistake 
          

For years Danzo and the Third Hokage were bitter rivals, with Danzo attempting to become Hokage with his ruthless, sneaky behavior. Due to Sarutobi&#39;s trusting nature, he appointed Danzo to the Council to hopefully appease him, but the Third Hokage should have been way more discerning and careful when placing Danzo in such an important political position. Danzo&#39;s precarious alliance with Hanzo of Hamegakure directly led to Yahiko&#39;s death and Nagato&#39;s ascension to leader of the Akatsuki, a group that remained a major threat to the heroes of Konoha for many years. By placing Danzo on the Council he gave him unprecedented political power, allowing him to get away with countless atrocities.




The Third Hokage made plenty of personal mistakes throughout Naruto, like not fulfilling Kushina&#39;s wish to raise Naruto or allowing Orochimaru to escape after discovering his twisted experiments, but perhaps his biggest mistake was appointing untrustworthy people to his advisory council. The corruption of Danzo, Homura, and Koharu led to many horrifying things befalling the Village Hidden in the Leaves and Konoha citizens, and if Sarutobi had only been more thoughtful when appointing these leaders many of the most tragic events in Naruto never would have happened.
