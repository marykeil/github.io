High school is a popular setting for various anime, and these are the ten best shows centering around this classic setting!





Of course, this isn&#39;t to say that high school anime is restricted to drama or romcoms. There is a large variety of shows out there where the trope is changed up a bit to make it feel new and unique. There&#39;s no limit to what stories can take place in high school, and the medium takes full advantage of this with its large catalog of potential favorites. With that in mind, here are ten of the very best high school anime that fans can seek out for their next big binge.









 








 10  Mieruko-Chan 
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll    
Kicking things off with a not-so-traditional high school anime, Mieruko-Chan is a horror comedy series that follows a schoolgirl named Mieruko who has a dark secret: she&#39;s able to see creepy spirits around her. To avoid suspicion, she chooses to pretend they don&#39;t exist even though she&#39;s absolutely terrified. The high school setting for this series makes it all the more enjoyable since it showcases Mieruko making friends while also trying to stop these ghouls from haunting them. It&#39;s charming, funny, and, at times, can be one of the best horror anime as well thanks to the ghosts&#39; disturbing designs.





 9  Tomo-Chan Is a Girl! 
        

  Year Released   2023    Number of Episodes   13    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll    
This fairly recent high school anime also doubles as one of the most adorable love stories in recent memory. It follows a tomboy named Tomo who realizes she has feelings for her best friend Junichiro. However, her crush has seen her as one of the guys for so long that it feels like she is invisible to him. This leads to numerous comedic hijinxs as Tomo attempts to show her feminine side at school and home to win him over while also not losing who she is along the way. The characters and writing here are absolutely stellar with a storyline that&#39;s not afraid to add some darker twists when it needs them.

The series follows a boy named Takeo Gōda who wants to find love for himself but is always overlooked by girls he likes because of his appearance. However, this all changes when he meets Rinko Yamato, a small and shy girl who develops an interest in him. My Love Story!! is a non-traditional romance that really works because it explores love beyond the shallowness of looks. It gets down to what makes two people truly fall for each other.

  Year Released   2017    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream It   Netflix

Instead of judging by popularity, the student government of Hyakkou Private Academy determines status based on wealth accumulated through gambling.

This leads to a mission for her to battle every member of the Student Council.

This hit anime based on the popular Shojo manga by Bisco Hatori has become a cult favorite from the 2000s over the years. The premise follows a student named Haruhi, who self-identifies as a biological female but believes that gender is irrelevant in how a person is perceived. Haruhi stumbles upon a host club run by the boys at her school and, after accidentally racking up some debt, she enlists as one of the hosts to pay them off. The show has gained a reputation for being absolutely adorable while also providing pretty progressive ideas regarding Haruhi&#39;s potential non-binary gender identity.





 4  Kaguya-Sama: Love is War 
        

  Year Released   2019    Number of Episodes   37    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Kaguya-Sama has become one of the most popular high school comedies in recent years. This hit 2019 series struck a chord with its audience with its fairly simple premise of two perfectly matched people who absolutely refuse to confess they love one another. This leads to a variety of situations where the opposing side and their friends try to goad the other to speak their feelings. What made this series a hit as well was how it became an absolute meme machine. Chika Fujiwara in particular became mega-popular with fans for her eccentric personality and excellent comedic timing. For lighthearted fun and an engaging glimpse at relationships, Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is a series that can&#39;t be missed.





 3  My Hero Academia 
        

  Year Released   2016    Number of Episodes   138 (so far)    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
My Hero Academia has become one of the hottest mainstream anime to come out in recent years, and it&#39;s easy to see why. In the age of the superhero, having a series that focuses on a school of heroes learning to use their powers for good is an excellent premise. What&#39;s even better though is that the show takes full advantage of its potential. Alongside the typical scenarios fans will find in most high school anime, there&#39;s also plenty of action with major deaths to up the stakes. It&#39;s a one-of-a-kind series that continues to air new episodes to this day, and it won&#39;t be disappearing from the public zeitgeist anytime soon.





 2  Komi Can&#39;t Communicate 
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream It   Netflix    
Komi Can&#39;t Communicate is about as wholesome as it gets when it comes to high school anime. The premise of a socially anxious teenage girl who wants to make 100 friends before she graduates from high school is a magnificent idea, and the storyline that plays out is incredibly engaging. However, it&#39;s Komi herself that makes this series so great. She&#39;s absolutely adorable with her exaggerated expressions and wholehearted attempts to socialize with her new friends.





 1  Assassination Classroom 
        

  Year Released   2015    Number of Episodes   47    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
Assassination Classroom is a one-of-a-kind anime experience. It completely subverts the typical high school anime by pitting the students against their teacher when they&#39;re told that if they don&#39;t kill him before the end of the year, the Earth will be destroyed. However, what makes the series work is how good of a teacher the monster-like Koro-Sensei really is. He&#39;s kindhearted and wants the best for his students, even though he knows that he could face his fate one unfortunate day in the middle of class. It&#39;s this student-teacher relationship that drives a lot of the drama for this series as it expands on each classmate in interesting ways, making them feel more fleshed out than other characters on this list. It all culminates in a perfect final season that&#39;s as satisfying as it is heartbreaking.
High school has always been a popular setting for fiction, and anime is no exception. While the emotional appeal of coming-of-age stories is a big part of the popularity of the genre, many series have explored different aspects of it or played with its established tropes. These are just a few of the many anime that fit within the high school subgenre. There are plenty of shows that are sure to appeal to different fans, and these are the absolute best high schoolanime to start with for those wanting to see why this concept is so popular.
