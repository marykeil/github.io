 What Happened In Delicious In Dungeon Episode 3? 
          




As the title would imply, Delicious in Dungeon episode #3, “Living Armor”, had the Touden Party fighting a group of living armors that all proved to be nigh indestructible. Laios broke away from the party to find whoever was controlling the armors while everyone else held them off, but he ended up in a fight with an even stronger living armor that quickly overwhelmed him. During the fight, however, Laios discovered that the true form of the living armors were colonies of mollusks working in tandem to move the armors, meaning Laios could beat them and, of course, eat them.

With his new knowledge in hand, Laios took advantage of how the living armors truly worked to immobilize his opponent and distracted the others to allow the rest of the party to escape with him. From there, Laios got everyone to eat the mollusks in a variety of dishes, and despite their initial apprehension, they found it to be surprisingly tasty. The episode concluded with Laios taking the sword of the commanding living armor for himself, only to discover that a mollusk was living in the sword, something that he kept to himself when Marcille asked to inspect the sword.

 Delicious In Dungeon Might Have Already Revealed Its Villain 
          

With everything that’s happened so far, Delicious in Dungeon seems to have already revealed the series&#39; main villain. A recurring motif in the series, even in the opening and ending themes, has been the imagery of a winged lion, and since that imagery has appeared primarily in the dungeon, especially with the living armor Laios fought, the winged lion is likely malicious and possibly the overarching antagonist of the series. All of that is mostly speculation at this point, but it will be interesting to see if Delicious in Dungeon does anything with that, going forward.
