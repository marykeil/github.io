## Literature Review

The Pokémon anime starring Ash has come to an end, but many fans still have questions about some of the series&#39; biggest unanswered questions.




The Pokémon anime starring Ash Ketchum came to an end in 2023, but despite the series&#39; ending, there are a great many mysteries about the Pokémon anime that fans are dying for answers about. These mysteries can range from the mundane and seemingly trivial to core concepts of character and the story&#39;s universe, which could radically alter how the series is seen by fans if answered.




While no answers are likely to come now that the series is over, fans still can&#39;t help but to debate some of these questions, and likely will for as long as there are Pokémon fans. It&#39;s always interesting to see what kind of story threads are left hanging when a long-running show like Pokémon finally ends, and the series definitely left a lot of open endings. Here are 10 of the biggest mysteries fans still wonder about in the classic Ash Ketchum Pokémon anime.


 Ash&#39;s Primeape Never Returned 
Ash Has One Pokémon He Basically Abandoned
          

Ash&#39;s Primeape was one of his earlier Pokémon, first encountered as a Mankey after it famously stole his hat. Primeape proved to be a competent battler, and was one of the stronger members of Ash&#39;s team at the time, but after entering it in a fighting Pokémon tournament, Ash&#39;s Primeape came out on top, and Ash left it with a trainer in the area, Anthony, to grow stronger. However, Ash never returns for Primeape, and while every other member of his original Kanto team had some kind of cameo in the final episodes of the anime (including Butterfree and Pidgeot, two other Pokémon who hadn&#39;t been seen in ages). Presumably, Anthony still has Ash&#39;s Primeape, but fans will never know for sure what happened to it.






 Team Rocket Vs. Team Plasma 
The Battle That Never Happened
          

In the early episodes of Black &amp; White, the story heavily hints at an upcoming conflict between Team Rocket and Team Plasma, the local &#34;evil&#34; team in the Unova region. However, no such conflict ever took place, and the original incarnation of Team Plasma (as seen in the Pokémon Black and White games) never actually appeared in the anime. This mystery actually does have some answer--such a conflict was planned, but due to the 2011 earthquake in Japan, the destructive episodes were postponed and eventually canceled. While fans never got to see the epic clash between Teams, the script of the Pokémon episode leaked to the public and was translated in 2023, finally revealing the lost story.



 Ash and Serena&#39;s Unresolved Relationship 
Ash Missed His True Chance at Romance
         




By far, Ash&#39;s most intensely romantic companion was XY&#39;s Serena. While Ash himself remained oblivious, Serena eventually came to grips with her feelings about Ash, and at the end of their journey, she gave him a little kiss before setting off. Serena and Ash never became an official couple, however, and despite Serena reappearing in Pokémon Journeys, she pointedly did not get to interact with Ash in her episode, leaving their feelings for one another unresolved. Serena was last seen watching Ash&#39;s victory in the Masters Eight on TV from Hoenn, still pining after Ash.



 The Evil Malamar is Still Out There 
One of the Few Genuinely Evil Pokémon Was Never Dealt With
          

In the Pokémon XY episode &#34;A Conspiracy to Conquer!&#34;, an evil Malamar appeared, which mind-controlled several people and attempted to use technology and its own power to take over the world. Malamar later reappeared in &#34;Facing the Grand Design!&#34;, where it was joined by two other Malamar, but while their plans are foiled, they ultimately escape, swearing to return some day and finish what they started. This evil Malamar and its compatriots are never seen again, and no explanation is ever given for why Malamar was so dedicated to evil. Was it experimented upon, like Mewtwo? Or simply a bad egg from the start? Fans will never find out, and the Pokémon world remains at risk.






 The Mystery of Tobias&#39; Pokémon 
One of the Toughest Trainers Has a Team Full of Legendaries
          

Fans of Diamond and Pearl will instantly recognize the name Tobias, as this trainer was the one responsible for knocking Ash out of the Sinnoh League tournament. Tobias is a quiet and mysterious character, and his selection of Pokémon, which included the mythical Darkrai and legendary Latios, stuck out. Where and how did Tobias capture these incredibly rare and powerful Pokémon? Did he have more at his disposal, making up a team of six needed for the tournament? A trainer owning such powerful Pokémon was almost unheard of in the anime at this stage, so fans had a lot of questions about Tobias that the show never answered.



 The Extent of Unown&#39;s True Power 
No One Knows What This Pokémon is Truly Capable Of
          




In the video games, Unown is a rather mediocre Pokémon, with poor stats and only a single (weak) move it can learn. However, the lore of the series has always implied Unown had greater importance and never was that more clear than in the third Pokémon movie, The Spell of the Unown. Here, Unown is portrayed as an extradimensional Pokémon with incredible, reality-warping powers. This goes beyond the movie as well, with Unown appearing in episodes like &#34;Star Night, Star Flight!&#34;, in which they have the ability to maintain eternal night for one town. How do these Unown wield such power, and what does it mean for them to have such abilities without being Legendary Pokémon?



 The Existence of Animals 
Animals Other Than Pokémon Must Exist
         

In the modern Pokémon anime, every creature shown on screen that isn&#39;t human is a Pokémon, but this wasn&#39;t always the case. In early episodes, many ordinary animals are seen, implying that Pokémon exist alongside animals and not in place of them. In the first episode, for example, Ash sees a Pidgey eating a worm, while a later episode shows a Gastly using illusions to make itself look like a mongoose.




While the obvious out-of-universe answer is that animals slowly disappeared as they were no longer needed and the count of Pokémon increased, it appears from a viewer&#39;s perspective as if animals are going extinct and being replaced by Pokémon. Of course, that also raises questions about what people eat as food without animals around...



 Brock and Professor Ivy&#39;s Breakup 
Fans Still Don&#39;t Know What Happened
          

When the Orange Islands arc of Pokémon began, Ash&#39;s companion Brock elected to stay behind at the regional professor&#39;s home, Professor Ivy. At the end of the arc, however, Brock rejoins the team, but any time Professor Ivy is mentioned, he&#39;s shown moping and unwilling to talk about it. Fans have long wondered just what might have happened between them, with fan theories ranging from a particularly brutal shutdown of his advances from an actual adult to the Professor actually being a lesbian and thus uninterested in men altogether. While it&#39;s ultimately not that important, the series dangles the question in front of viewers without ever offering an answer.






 Who is Ash&#39;s Father? 
Ash&#39;s Dad Remains A Complete Mystery For No Apparent Reason
          

One of the series&#39; biggest mysteries is the identity of Ash&#39;s father. Ash&#39;s father is known to exist; he&#39;s referred to indirectly on a few occasions. In the special episode &#34;Distant Blue Sky,&#34; set in the &#34;I Choose You&#34; movie continuity, Ash&#39;s father is supposed to meet him at a nearby Pokémon Center, but ultimately they miss each other, robbing fans of a last-second reveal. Fans speculated that perhaps Ash&#39;s father was a character they already knew, including such outlandish guesses as Giovanni of Team Rocket. The anime&#39;s novelization of the first season suggests that Ash&#39;s father was a trainer who went on a journey and never returned. Which is true? Fans may never know.



 The GS Ball Was Left to Be Forgotten 
Pokémon&#39;s Biggest Dangling Plot-Thread




         

Throughout the Orange Islands and early Johto story arcs, Ash is on a mission to obtain a mysterious Poké Ball, the GS Ball, and take it to various experts for them to examine it. The mystery of the GS Ball was a key element of the series for quite a long time, but Ash ultimately wound up giving it to the Poké Ball expert, Kurt, and never dealing with it again. So what was in the Pokémon anime&#39;s GS Ball? According to a director of the anime, Masamitsu Hidaka, it was intended to be Celebi, who would star in a major anime arc, but this idea was shelved when Celebi was chosen as the star of the fourth movie, Pokémon 4Ever. Hidaka admitted that they hoped fans would simply forget about the GS Ball, but they clearly never did.




               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games.
