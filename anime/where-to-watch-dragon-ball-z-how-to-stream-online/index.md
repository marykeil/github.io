When the series is as big as Dragon Ball Z, there are many people who want to bring it to their platform. Fortunately for fans, no one platform has complete streaming rights and there are quite a few options to choose from. Dragon Ball Z is streaming on Crunchyroll, which is the most popular option. Funimation is the official distributor of the Dragon Ball franchise in North America, and they have Dragon Ball Z and all the other Dragon Ball series and movies. Both Crunchyroll and Funimation have the same parent company and thus access to the same series.

The series is available on Amazon Prime as well, but only if fans buy it, unlike these other subscription-based platforms. The re-edited version of Z, Dragon Ball Z Kai, is the outlier among the franchise as it is only available on Hulu. The original version of Z is not yet available on Hulu, but hopefully, it will be in the future. Ultimately, fans of Dragon Ball Z can&#39;t go wrong with Crunchyroll or Funimation, as both have every single Dragon Ball show save for Kai.
