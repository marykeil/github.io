## Literature Review

Shonen Jump&#39;s new battle manga feels like a mix of other hit series and will need to prove it has something of its own if it wants to last long-term.





Kagurabachi, which arrived earlier this September, had an eye-catching opening when its anti-hero, Chihiro, cut a bloody swathe through a mafia outfit. While first impressions are everything, questions remain as to what new quirks the manga has to offer afterward. As things stand, it lies in the shadow of other far more popular series that use similar tools for its plot devices.





  : New Shonen Jump Series is Already Receiving Massive Hype Even Before Its Release 


 Kagurabachi&#39;s Setting Risks To Be Cliché Already 
          

The first chapter of Shonen Jump&#39;s new manga had plenty of visual spectacle, but its story premise felt a little threadbare. Set in a retro-modern world, where modern T-shirts exist next to 1920&#39;s-style steam trains, the plot quickly reveals that Chihiro, the son of the best swordsmith of the land, armed with the last and most magical of his father&#39;s swords, plans to exterminate the Hishaku, a group of villainous sorcerers. His cold-blooded massacre of the Korogumi thugs - a mafia group operating under the sway of the Hishaku - does give Chihiro a first impression far different from other plucky, all-loving shonen protagonists. But questions remain about the strength of the setting itself.

Simply put, the urban fantasy setup feels quaint. Anime fans are intimately familiar with spell casters in a city, and diehards would likely sooner watch Jujutsu Kaisen, which is gorgeously animated by MAPPA. Chihiro&#39;s magical blades aren&#39;t groundbreaking either. While their detailed surfaces and magical abilities are pleasing to the eye, they number among countless other highly advertised katana, even if one disregards Demon Slayer and its many Nichiren blades. While it is foolish to write off Kagurabachi after one chapter, if its main hook is magic swordsmen in a pseudo-realistic setting, educated manga readers will find it more than a little cliché at this point.






 Kagurabachi Has The Potential To Be A Good Addition To Shonen Jump 
          

The story does have its merits, however. The first chapter knows how to pace itself: while it begins with a lengthy domestic scene with Chihiro and his father, it jumps ahead to his adult years. The story knows not to belabor the obvious to readers: Chihiro&#39;s father was always going to become the origin of a revenge story. The brutal fighting and current crime thriller angle also provides a different mood compared to its contemporaries. When Kagurabachi drops its next chapter, Takeru Hokazono will need to show what else his new world has besides swords and sorcery, anime&#39;s old standbys.
