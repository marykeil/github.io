## Literature Review

As fun as Shangri La Frontier is, its written game mechanics once more are used to inflate the protagonist&#39;s powers, rather than build a world.





Rakuro &#34;Sunraku&#34; Hizutome speaks and acts like a gamer; that isn&#39;t in question. However, many of his banal stunts feel too self-congratulatory, making the anime give in to the all too onerous clichÃ©s of the overpowered fantasy hero. This is a shame since Shangri La Frontier otherwise has deserved moments of levity, and of course, beautifully drawn action scenes.

 Shangri La Frontier Didn&#39;t Need a Power Fantasy 
          

Many anime protagonists these days are now reliant on some quirk - optionally one leading to ostracization - becoming the core ability that lifts them up to godlike power by the end of the story. In Hizutome&#39;s case, his hobby of playing shovelware games is so mundane it&#39;s ludicrous writers want to convince fan this is a talent, yet Shangri La Frontier insists it is. Besides skills finely honed from playing glitchy entertainment, Sunraku&#39;s Shangri La avatar - a man wearing only underwear and a bird mask - is treated as an outside-the-box strategy that only he, the &#34;Trash Game King&#34;, could have envisioned.




Unfortunately, in 2023 this is all standard gamer tradition to the point of banality. A gamer subjecting themselves to &#34;trash games&#34; is likely to be livestreaming their antics. Meanwhile, wearing inappropriate outfits, or any at all, is just a way to raise hell or a self-appointed challenge to kill a boss while at the risk of dying in one hit. Even Sunraku&#39;s &#34;genius&#34; tactic of dumping his allotted skill points into Luck is nothing groundbreaking. Yet because Shangri La tries so earnestly to pretend its protagonist is some unparalleled genius, it only makes his skills come across as artificial.

Shangri La Frontier can be genuinely amusing when it actually talks about gaming itself. When someone complains about useless AI-controlled characters or skips a game&#39;s introductory cutscene, it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true to life. While the hero&#39;s misadventures briefly mention them, ultimately the game exists just to glorify him, not video gaming itself. While Shangri La Frontier gained a lot of attention for these gestures to actual gamer habits, if the anime is going to continue congratulating its hero for acting like a typical player, it&#39;s ultimately not going to set a higher standard in much else beyond animation quality.
