## Literature Review

The Netflix Godzilla anime adaptations contain some of the coolest and most unique depictions of Godzilla in the franchise&#39;s history.




Godzilla Minus One has debuted in Japan to critical acclaim and box office success. Before Toho&#39;s latest live-action Godzilla movie debuts in North American theaters on December 1, Godzilla fans should check out the Netflix anime Godzilla adaptations. Consisting of the 2017-2018 film trilogy and the 2021 series Singular Point, the Netflix anime adaptations contain some of the coolest and most unique depictions of Godzilla in the franchise&#39;s history.




The two Netflix anime Godzilla adaptations are considered part of the franchise&#39;s Reiwa era, which began in 2016 with the release of Shin Godzilla and is named for the current Emperor of Japan.

          

Although both the anime trilogy and Singular Point have been divisive with the Godzilla fanbase, their portrayals put truly unique spins on Godzilla and each has enough style that they&#39;re worth watching at least once. Godzilla fans definitely shouldn&#39;t ignore the anime trilogy or the Singular Point series.



2016&#39;s Shin Godzilla was directed by Hideaki Anno, the creator of Evangelion.

While the Godzilla franchise has had sci-fi elements since the first film and has regularly featured other planets and alien characters, the anime trilogy is the most overtly sci-fi story in Godzilla history. The plot is set into motion when the emergence of kaiju forces humanity to flee Earth and take to space, with the survivors ultimately ending up displaced in time and returning to a far-future Earth where Godzilla has become the dominant life form. Overall, the anime trilogy has an unfortunate tendency to be too dark for its own good, perhaps not surprising given that the trilogy was written by Gen Urobochi, also the writer of the infamously dark Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

While the narrative aspects of the trilogy stumble at times, the trilogy does put an undeniably interesting twist on classic aspects of the franchise. Godzilla Earth, the trilogy&#39;s version of Godzilla, is a towering 1000 feet tall, the largest Godzilla ever depicted on screen, MechaGodzilla is a living city that threatens to assimilate the entire planet, and King Ghidorah is a phantasmal, extra-dimensional energy being. Still, the whole trilogy kills off most of the human cast and ends on a decidedly bleak note that feels overall pretty futile. While undeniably stylish, the Godzilla anime trilogy struggles to deliver much substance, though it is a novel reimagining of the franchise.

The 2021 series is directed by Atsushi Takahashi and written by Toh EnJoe
         

Paradoxically, Godzilla Singular Point is both a return to the tone and themes of early entries in the franchise, while also being the most unique Godzilla story in the entire franchise. Fittingly, the paradoxical nature of Singular Point fits into the Quantum Mechanics theme of the series and the central idea that two contradictory states can be true at the same time. The Godzilla of Singular Point is smaller than most other versions of Godzilla, but much like as depicted in Shin Godzilla, this version of Godzilla is nightmarish because of how incomprehensible and otherworldly it is. By altering the laws of physics in its vicinity and spreading its influence, the Godzilla of Singular Point threatens to break the rules of reality just by existing.






The paradoxical nature of Singular Point fits into the Quantum Mechanics theme of the series and the central idea that two contradictory states can be true at the same time.




This heavy reliance on the rules of Quantum Mechanics is also Singular Point&#39;s greatest weakness. Singular Point is a very exposition-heavy series with things like time loops and parallel dimensions discussed in great detail. While these explanations are broadly correct enough that viewers will learn something about Quantum Mechanics, it can be hard to follow. As a result of so much scientific discussions between the human characters, Singular Point was a target of the franchise&#39;s long-standing criticism that it focuses too much on the humans and not enough on Godzilla. Still, while Singular Point Godzilla does have a fairly small amount of screen time, especially because of how unique weird he is, he steals every scene he&#39;s in.

Watch On Netflix




Although the Netflix Godzilla anime adaptations certainly have narrative flaws, both the film trilogy and the Singular Point anime series put undeniably unique spins on the franchise and have a great deal of style. For Godzilla fans, both the film trilogy and Singular Point are worth at least watching once. Re-watching these Netflix anime adaptations is the perfect way to prepare for the North American debut of Godzilla Minus One on December 1.
