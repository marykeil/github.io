  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>There are very few living animators who have such a storied and prolific career as Hayao Miyazaki.
Miyazaki wrote some Studio Ghibli movies that he did not direct, and these, like the
Secret World of Arrietty
and
From Up on Poppy Hill
, are perhaps among his weakest.
The Boy and the Heron
, Miyazaki&rsquo;s most recent movie, proves that he is still a great director and writer of characters.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Hayao Miyazaki is one of the biggest names in animation, and here&rsquo;s how all of his movies, including The Boy and the Heron, compare to each other.</p>
<p>Warning: Contains spoilers for The Boy and the Heron.Hayao Miyazaki’s work has undeniably impacted animation, especially his movies, and there’s a definite hierarchy to them, too. Miyazaki is undeniably one of the biggest names in not just anime, but cinema, in general. The films and TV shows he’s created, both before and after founding Studio Ghibli, have all gone on to be some of the most beloved stories in all of animation, and they’ve all managed to strike a chord with people worldwide.
Whether it comes down to the story, characters, animation, or just overall writing, some of Hayao Miyazaki’s films, directed by him or otherwise, are easily better than others, and that’s true of his work from both before and after he founded Studio Ghibli.</p>
<p>There are very few living animators who have such a storied and prolific career as Hayao Miyazaki, and as such, there’s definite merit in seeing how all of the movies he’s been involved with across so many decades compare to one another.
: All Studio Ghibli Movies In Order of Release Date (Including How Do You Live?)</p>
<p>15  Howl’s Moving Castle Is Hayao Miyazaki’s Most Overrated Movie
Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle - 2004</p>
<p>Release Date   November 20, 2004    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Emily Mortimer, Jean Simmons, Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Billy Crystal    Runtime   119 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
The Hayao Miyazaki movie that easily stands out as his worst is 2004’s Howl’s Moving Castle. The story is one of the weakest of any Studio Ghibli film with a severe lack of development, agency, and logic. Not only is Sophie a surprisingly passive Studio Ghibli protagonist, but her relationship with Howl is never written convincingly because of how one-sided it is from Sophie spending so much time helping Howl and his friends and Howl never returning the favor. Howl’s Moving Castle is often heralded as one of the best Studio Ghibli films, but it’s hard to see it as anything other than Miyazaki’s worst effort.

<p>14  The Secret World Of Arrietty Is Surprisingly Dull, Despite Its Interesting Premise
The Secret World Of Arrietty - 2010
Release Date   July 17, 2010    Director   Hiromasa Yonebayashi    Cast   Bridgit Mendler, David Henrie, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Carol Burnett    Runtime   95 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
Hayao Miyazaki may have only written 2010’s The Secret World of Arrietty, with Hiromasa Yonebayashi directing, but it’s a very weak film, regardless. Seeing the tiny Borrowers interact with the giant, mundane world around them always makes for a wonderful aesthetic, but the story and characters are both far too underdeveloped to be engaging in the slightest, the villain especially standing out as one of the worst in any Studio Ghibli film. Yonebayashi’s next Studio Ghibli film, When Marnie Was There, would be a far better film than The Secret World of Arrietty, but that doesn’t change how much Arrietty wasted both Yonebayashi’s and Miyazaki’s talents.

<p>13  From Up On Poppy Hill Ruined Its Story For Seemingly No Reason
From Up On Poppy Hill - 2011</p>
<p>Release Date   July 16, 2011    Director   Goro Miyazaki    Cast   Sarah Bolger, Anton Yelchin, Edie Mirman, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Noth    Runtime   92 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
Another film that Hayao Miyazaki only wrote and was overall lackluster is 2011’s From Up on Poppy Hill. Directed by Goro Miyazaki, the film initially succeeds at selling a cute romance story between the two leads, but the second half introduces a plotline about the leads thinking they’re brother and sister, which does nothing but grind what should have been a simple story to a halt for the sake of pointless melodrama that could have been easily written out. From Up on Poppy Hill is still a far better film than Goro Miyazaki’s other films, Tales from Earthsea and Earwig and the Witch.

<p>12  My Neighbor Totoro Has Surprisingly Very Little Going On For It
My Neighbor Totoro - 1988</p>
<p>Release Date   April 16, 1988    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Tim Daly, Lea Salonga, Frank Welker    Runtime   86 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
1988’s My Neighbor Totoro is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s most iconic films of all time, with Totoro even being Studio Ghibli’s mascot, and that makes the lack of quality in the film all the more surprising. As cute as Satsuki and Mei’s antics can be, the lack of a central narrative for most of the story makes it hard to feel invested in anything, and Totoro’s surprising lack of screentime only further emphasizes that feeling that nothing ever really happens. My Neighbor Totoro is hardly the only slice-of-life movie Studio Ghibli has done, but it’s handled far more effectively elsewhere, and this one ultimately suffers from its lack of execution.

<p>11  Kiki’s Delivery Service Improves On The Slice-of-Life Formula
Kiki&rsquo;s Delivery Service - 1989</p>
<p>Release Date   July 29, 1989    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman, Tress MacNeille, Janeane Garofalo, Matthew Lawrence    Runtime   102 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
1989’s Kiki’s Delivery Service has a similar formula as My Neighbor Totoro, and to a certain extent, it’s executed far more effectively. Both films suffer from a lack of a central narrative and stakes, but Kiki’s Delivery Service being framed around the titular delivery service does allow for a comparatively more focused story that the film more than benefits from. Not only that, but while the story doesn’t have the maturity of its contemporaries, Kiki’s struggles with burnout and having to understand that inspiration comes and goes is surprisingly poignant for an otherwise childish film, and that helps it stand above some of Miyazaki’s weaker stories.

<p>10  Ponyo Finally Strikes A Good Balance Between Fantasy And Slice-Of-Life
Ponyo -2008</p>
<p>Release Date   July 19, 2008    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Noah Cyrus, Frankie Jonas, Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Matt Damon    Runtime   101 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
2008’s Ponyo is another Hayao Miyazaki film that blends fantasy with slice-of-life antics, and the execution is far better than some of its contemporaries. While Ponyo also has a problem with a lack of agency in its story, the stakes are far better established than they are in other films, and while Ponyo and Sosuke aren’t that deep compared to other Studio Ghibli protagonists, their dynamic is still good enough for that to not matter. Add in some of the best art and animation to ever feature in a Studio Ghibli film, and Ponyo still has a lot to offer over a decade after its release.

<p>9  The Wind Rises Would Have Been A Good Finale For Hayao Miyazaki
The Wind Rises - 2013</p>
<p>Release Date   July 20, 2013    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Martin Short, Stanley Tucci    Runtime   126 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
2013’s The Wind Rises was once intended to be Hayao Miyazaki’s final film, but even with that, it’s a surprisingly uneven film. The story never feels like it goes as far with its political messages as it should, and with how slow the pacing tends to be, it makes for a film that feels like it’s always holding itself back. That being said, the animation is some of Miyazaki’s best, and Jiro Horikoshi is given some of the best character writing of any 2010s Studio Ghibli film, so if Miyazaki had retired with The Wind Rises, it still would have been a good film for him to go out on.

<p>8  Porco Rosso Is Hayao Miyazaki’s Underrated Masterpiece
Porco Rosso - 1992</p>
<p>Release Date   July 18, 1992    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Michael Keaton, Cary Elwes, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Susan Egan, Tom Kenny    Runtime   94 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
Among Hayao Miyazaki’s older works, 1992’s Porco Rosso is the one that gets the least attention, but it’s still a great film to watch. The film is somewhat light on story, but it does a great job of selling itself as a goofy film with a likable cast to make up for that, and the absurdity of Porco being treated as a dashing rogue despite having a pig’s head perfectly embodies that idea. Add in Miyazaki’s always impressive visuals, and Porco Rosso is a film that excellently keeps to the Studio Ghibli aesthetic of balancing goofiness with occasional bits of seriousness, and that makes it plenty worth watching.

<p>7  Castle In The Sky Was An Amazing Debut Film For Studio Ghibli
Castle In The Sky - 1986</p>
<p>Release Date   August 2, 1986    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   James Van Der Beek, Anna Paquin, Cloris Leachman, Jim Cummings, Mark Hamill    Runtime   124 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
1986’s Castle in the Sky was the first official Studio Ghibli film, and it was an all-around amazing debut for the company. In addition to having a great cast of heroes and villains alike and one of Miyazaki’s best executions of an environmental message, Castle in the Sky does an incredible job of crafting a classic adventure story with some of the most vibrant animation and visuals in a Studio Ghibli film, even after almost 40 years. Castle in the Sky more than holds up decades later, and it’s easy to see it as having set the standard for what Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli would do for years to come.

<p>6  The Boy And The Heron Shows That Hayao Miyazaki Is Still As Great As Ever
The Boy And The Heron -2023</p>
<p>Release Date   July 14, 2023    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Luca Padovan, Robert Pattinson, Karen Fukuhara, Christian Bale, Mark Hamill    Runtime   124 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Currently Unavailable <br>
Hayao Miyazaki officially came out of retirement with 2023’s The Boy and the Heron, and it’s more than a worthy return to animation for him. Not only is the art, animation, and overall direction some of Miyazaki’s best, but the story, while weak in some areas, has some of the most emotionally resonant storytelling of any Studio Ghibli film, and that leads to its themes of grief and figuring out how to live one’s life to come across in the best of ways. The Boy and the Heron is easily Studio Ghibli’s best film in years, and it creates plenty of excitement for Miyazaki’s future work with the company.</p>
<p>The Boy and the Heron Review: Ghibli&rsquo;s Best Movie in Years is Finally Here
The Boy and the Heron is the long-awaited new film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and it stands out as one of their best projects in years.</p>
<p>5  Princess Mononoke Is Action Fantasy At Its Finest
1997&rsquo;s Princess Mononoke</p>
<p>Release Date   July 12, 1997    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson    Runtime   133 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
While Hayao Miyazaki is no stranger to action fantasy stories, no movie of his leans into it more, or does it better, than 1997’s Princess Mononoke. The fight choreography still more than holds up after over 20 years, as does the simple, yet effective character writing of Ashitaka, San, and the rest of the principal cast, and the way that the environmental message comes together at the very end makes for an incredibly poignant finale that few other Studio Ghibli movies have ever come close to. All in all, it’s easy to see why Princess Mononoke remains such an iconic entry in Hayao Miyazaki’s film catalog.

<p>4  Nausicaä Of The Valley Of The Wind Perfectly Embodies Hayao Miyazaki’s Standards
1984&rsquo;s Nausicaä Of The Valley Of The Wind</p>
<p>Release Date   March 11, 1984    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, Shia LaBeouf, Uma Thurman, Mark Hamill    Runtime   117 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
1984’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was retroactively made the first Studio Ghibli film, and it served as a perfect showing of what the company and Hayao Miyazaki were capable of. Not only is the animation still some of the best, with it even being one of the first projects of Hideaki Anno of Neon Genesis Evangelion fame, but Nausicaä balances Hayao Miyazaki’s trademark storytelling beats about preserving the environment and the evils of war in a way that works incredibly well without ever getting too preachy. All in all, 40 years later, Nausicaä is still easily one of Hayao Miyazaki’s greatest achievements in animation.

<p>3  Spirited Away More Than Earned Its Academy Award
2001&rsquo;s Spirited Away</p>
<p>Release Date   July 20, 2001    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette, Susan Egan, Bob Bergen    Runtime   125 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
When it comes to prestige for both Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, no better film comes to mind than 2001’s Spirited Away, and that’s perfectly justified. The fantasy elements are depicted in some of the most striking fashion of any Studio Ghibli film, whether it’s through the character designs or the stunning animation accompanying them, and Chihiro’s growth into a more confident and independent person is one of the best character arcs of any Studio Ghibli protagonist with some of the best execution. Spirited Away stands out as the only foreign language film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and it more than deserves that honor.

<p>2  Whisper Of The Heart Might Be The Best Studio Ghibli Film Ever Made
1995&rsquo;s Whisper Of The Heart</p>
<p>Release Date   July 15, 1995    Director   Yoshifumi Kondo    Cast   Brittany Snow, David Gallagher, Cary Elwes, Jean Smart, James Sikking    Runtime   111 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Max <br>
Of all of Hayao Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli films, the one that’s probably the best is one that he only wrote, 1995’s Whisper of the Heart. The film’s story of creativity and self-worth has the most mature writing of any of Miyazaki’s films, and thanks to Yoshifumi Kondo’s incredible direction, the animation, music cues, and overall shot composition make for a film with the best direction of any Studio Ghibli film. Kondo tragically passed away without making another film, but his directing, combined with Miyazaki’s writing, still led to Whisper of the Heart being Studio Ghibli’s most underrated masterpiece of all time.

<p>1  The Castle Of Cagliostro Is Still Hayao Miyazaki’s Greatest Film To Date
1979&rsquo;s Lupin III: The Castle Of Cagliostro</p>
<p>Release Date   December 15, 1979    Director   Hayao Miyazaki    Cast   David Hayter, John Snyder, Michael Gregory, Dorothy Elias-Fahn, Bridget Hoffman    Runtime   100 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Hoopla <br>
Out of every film Hayao Miyazaki has made, the one that undoubtedly stands out as the best is his debut film, 1979’s Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro. While the characterization and tone might not be consistent with other Lupin III stories, The Castle of Cagliostro is a thrilling heist story from start to finish with great writing and utterly chaotic animation that makes it one of the most fun to watch movies in Miyazaki’s entire film catalog. Hayao Miyazaki’s future films might be more technically sound, but in terms of quality, The Castle of Cagliostro is still the best Hayao Miyazaki film after 45 years.
