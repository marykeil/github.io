# Only One Era of Pokémon Proved How to Make Team Rocket Legitimately Scary Again


## SUMMARY 



  In the XY era, Team Rocket finally becomes a real threat thanks to their sleek and dangerous high-tech devices.   These new devices, such as control collars and collapsible cages, have a more high-tech flair and are more effective than their previous machines.   Despite their new technology, Team Rocket&#39;s incompetence and reliance on giant mechas ultimately undermine their effectiveness as villains.

## Literature Review

The XY era of the anime saw Team Rocket with some major technological upgrades, which made them much more of a threat than they had been.




Team Rocket are the eternal adversaries in the Pokémon anime, but it&#39;s only in the XY era that Team Rocket actually felt like a real threat, and it&#39;s all thanks to the enhanced technology that they had at their disposal. While earlier eras of Team Rocket often utilized massive machines and mecha to obtain their goals, the devices that XY&#39;s versions had on hand were much sleeker and less obvious, making them even more dangerous as a result.




Team Rocket, of course, spend most of their time in the Pokémon anime trying to steal Pikachu, along with various other Pokémon on occasion. In earlier eras of the anime, Team Rocket relied on rather simplistic disguises and traps, such as their long-time favorite, the pit trap, which had a pathetically low rate of success even at a moment-by-moment basis. The Hoenn and Sinnoh eras saw Team Rocket&#39;s flair for the dramatic result in a shift towards using ridiculous giant Team Rocket robots to obtain their goals, although the usual result of using these machines was for them to explode in Jessie and James&#39; faces. In XY, however, Team Rocket have some new tech on hand that made their old stuff look like toys.


 Team Rocket&#39;s XY Technology Is An Impressive Array of Capture Tools 
          

Starting in the second episode of XY, Team Rocket had new means of trying to steal Pokémon. They first deploy a control collar on a Garchomp living at Professor Sycamore&#39;s lab, causing it to go on a massive rampage that destroys a good chunk of Lumiose City. In later episodes, they have collapsible cages with electrified bars, as well as energy nets which spontaneously generate after being thrown. While Team Rocket has tried hundreds of tricks to capture Pikachu at this point, the devices that they use in Kalos have a more high-tech flair to them, and even their momentary effectiveness is enough to give fans pause, as their tools might actually be up to the task for once.




Of course, Team Rocket is still as incompetent as ever, so even these high-tech devices aren&#39;t quite enough to actually get away with Pikachu, or the other Pokémon they try to steal early in XY. Jessie and James do seem to appreciate the value that new technology brings to them, though, and even have the foresight to turn Ash&#39;s new tinkerer companion, Clemont, against him by tricking him into working on their own machines. They eventually end up resorting to giant mecha again, which goes about as well as it always does. It&#39;s a bit of a shame, as Team Rocket with smaller, more high-tech devices is definitely a bigger threat than any hastily assembled mecha could be.

While Team Rocket is never really meant to be a serious threat, the tech at their disposal in Kalos was noteworthy largely because in someone else&#39;s hands, it may well have been able to actually steal Pikachu. It&#39;s more the kind of technology that one would expect Pokémon thieves to use, rather than absurd disguises or obvious traps. These devices were practical and useful, and some such as the collapsible cages functioned perfectly, and were only undone because Team Rocket lost the controls. Team Rocket may never actually be the dangerous and competent villains they see themselves as, but their equipment in the Pokémon XY anime was the kind of professional tools that should&#39;ve kept Ash up at night.
