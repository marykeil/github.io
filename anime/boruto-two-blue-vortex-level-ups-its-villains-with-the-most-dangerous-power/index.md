## Literature Review

Chapter 2 ups the stakes as Code&#39;s Claw Grimes are revealed to have new abilities. Worse, they may be too much for the villain to handle.





As Code&#39;s raid on Konoha continues chapter 2 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, it&#39;s been revealed that the Claw Grimes are essentially able to kill with a single bite as they turn their victims into trees. It&#39;s just one sign of the creatures continuing to grow in ability, as they continue to surprise the heroes with their powers. Boruto, meanwhile, seemingly having some greater awareness, warns that they may become a threat to everyone, possibly laying the groundwork for future plot threads.

Whatever Code has done to his monsters during the interim seems to have paid off. In the second chapter, a combination of Team 10, Sarada, Himawari, and Kawaki face off against one of the Claw Grimes. On the Claw Mark on its head, a Rinnegan opens up, serving as one of its eyes. While it doesn&#39;t exhibit any Jutsus, it&#39;s still a sign that the creatures are becoming more like miniature Ten-Tails. Illustrating this is the one obvious new power they have: by grabbing and biting onto a victim, they transform into a tree, consuming the target in the process.

Code describes this as an enhancement of the instinct from the original Ten-Tails to find an Otsutsuki in order to create a divine tree. Either way, it&#39;s only one of many powers the Claw Grimes are exhibiting now. In Chapter 2, Sarada discovered they were capable of using their Claw Marks to teleport more of their number in; with their Rinnegans in place, their future feats are only limited by series creator Masashi Kishimoto&#39;s imagination. The fact that Boruto is warning Code against underestimating the Ten-Tails foreshadows that if ever they go rogue, they may mutate further and gain even more lethal abilities.




The newfound significance of the Claw Grimes - a Rinnegan is always bad news - and the promise of more powers shows that they will be the major plot device for the new Boruto storyline, functioning both as a common enemy and as a way to expand on the lore of both the Ten-Tails and the Otsutsuki. There has been some speculation that Code will bow out of Boruto&#39;s story thanks to his overconfidence. If so, the Ten-Tails will take center stage as the main threat, all but ensuring that Code&#39;s flunkies will stay in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex independent of him.
