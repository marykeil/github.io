## Literature Review

The Boy and the Heron has finally revealed its English dub cast, and the star-studded lineup is sure to make it one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s best dubs yet.





Going right along with that, The Boy and the Heron has recently revealed the cast of its English dub. There are many talented actors involved, but the ones who stand out the most, either because of their fame or because of their prior history with Studio Ghibli, are Dave Bautista, Florence Pugh, Willem Dafoe, Christian Bale, and Mark Hamill. Studio Ghibli movies often boast some of the best English dubs in all anime, and with a cast like this, The Boy and the Heron is bound to follow that same example.





 The Boy And The Heron&#39;s English Cast Has Real Starpower 
          

For the principal cast of The Boy and the Heron, Luca Padovan will voice Mahito, Robert Pattinson the Grey Heron, Karen Fukuhara Lady Himi, Gemma Chan Natsuko, Christian Bale Mahito’s father Shoichi, Mark Hamill Mahito’s granduncle, Florence Pugh Kiriko, Willem Dafoe the Noble Pelican, Mamoudou Athie, Tony Revolori and Dan Stevens the parakeets, and Dave Bautista the Parakeet King. At the time of writing, the voice actors for Izumi, Utako, Eriko, Aiko, and the Warawara have not been revealed, but their voice actors will most likely be revealed in the upcoming weeks. Additionally, Michael Sinterniklaas will direct the dub at NYAV Post and Stephanie Sheh will compose the English script.

                  Most Anticipated Movies Of Fall 2023   The year might be almost over, but there are plenty of exciting movies still releasing this fall. Here are the most anticipated movies of Fall 2023.   






 The Boy And The Heron’s English Dub Brings Back Studio Ghibli Alumni 
          

One of the most notable aspects of The Boy and the Heron’s English dub is that it brings back several Studio Ghibli alumni. Willem Dafoe, for example, previously voiced Cob in Tales from Earthsea, and Dan Stevens stands as the most recent Studio Ghibli alumni from voicing Thomas in Earwig and the Witch. Most famously, of course, Christian Bale voiced Howl in Howl’s Moving Castle, and Mark Hamill has had two different roles in Studio Ghibli films: the mayor of Pejite in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Colonel Muska in Castle in the Sky.

                  The Boy &amp; The Heron is Not Miyazaki’s Last Movie, as Producer Confirms ‘He Already Has New Ideas’   The Boy and the Heron was reportedly going to be Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s final film, but a recent interview revealed that that&#39;s far from the case.   




The reason behind the casting of Studio Ghibli alumni is likely twofold. For starters, with The Boy and the Heron being such a big film for both Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, GKIDS likely wanted to play into that by having some of Studio Ghibli’s most recent and most celebrated alumni be involved. Beyond that, those four alumni are all talented actors in their own right, and with them working with the rest of the stellar cast and staff involved, The Boy and the Heron’s dub will undoubtedly be great to behold once the film finally releases on December 8.
