## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons has announced the beginning of a new major story arc, focusing on the still mysterious Legendary Pokémon, Terapagos.





Episode #25 of Pokémon Horizons saw a major confrontation between the Rising Volt Tacklers and the Explorers, as the latter made their move to steal Terapagos while Liko, Roy, and Friede were visiting Liko&#39;s grandmother. A massive battle broke out, destroying much of the castle they were in, but everyone managed to escape to the airship, leaving the Explorers empty-handed.




          

Aboard the airship, Liko&#39;s grandmother gave her a new objective: to find the &#34;Six Heroes,&#34; Pokémon that once belonged to the legendary ancient Adventurer Lucius. Terapagos has some sort of tie to these Pokémon, and unraveling its secrets may require tracking down these friends from its past.


 Pokémon Horizons&#39; New Arc Brings Liko and Roy&#39;s Stories Together 


          

The announcement, which came after episode 25 aired in Japan, was accompanied by a poster that featured the Terastal Form of Terapagos, something that hasn&#39;t yet been seen in the anime. Since Terapagos is not available in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games yet, how it transforms between these forms is still up in the air, but the anime may well reveal it first at this rate. Despite being the beginning of a new arc, it doesn&#39;t appear that there will be any kind of break between them, with episode #26 still on schedule for the following week.




Throughout the first 25 episodes that make up the opening arc, there were two main plotlines: the story of Liko and her pendant, and that of Roy and the Black Rayquaza, which escaped from his Ancient Poké Ball. The pendant and the Ancient Poké Balls were clearly related in some way, but it wasn&#39;t obvious how. Now, in order to discover the truth about Terapagos, they&#39;ll have to collect the remaining Ancient Poké Balls, which finally unites Liko and Roy&#39;s goals into one. Terapagos and its bond with these Pokémon is now front and center, offering the chance for fans to learn more about this mysterious Pokémon.



 Pokémon Horizons&#39; Focus On Plot Makes It Refreshingly Different 
          

While the focus on Terapagos is undoubtedly designed to build excitement for the upcoming second part of Scarlet and Violet&#39;s DLC, the story surrounding Terapagos so far has been quite fascinating, well well-tied into the lore of the anime&#39;s world. Pokémon Horizons has done a great job of telling a plot-heavy story so far, something the old Pokémon anime often shied away from. To officially move into a new phase of the story is an exciting development, and episode 25 felt like a climax for the first story arc. As Liko, Roy, and Pokémon Horizons as a whole prepare to enter a new era, the series simply can&#39;t come out internationally soon enough.
