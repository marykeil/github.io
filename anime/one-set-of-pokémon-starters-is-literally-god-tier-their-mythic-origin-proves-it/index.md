## Literature Review

Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup may seem to have humble beginnings, but they&#39;re all inspired by deities from pantheons around the world.





The Sinnoh region and its Pokémon are heavily influenced by mythology from around the world. Chimchar, Piplup, and Turtwig take this theme to the next level. While seemingly humble and cute, the starters are each based off of deities that play major roles in their respective cultures. Chimchar is based off of the Chinese Monkey King, Sun Wukong; Turtwig on the World Turtle, and Piplup embodies Poseidon, the god of the seas.





 Sinnoh&#39;s Starter Pokémon Are Gods From Different Myths 
          

The influence of the starters&#39; mythical origins varies with each one, becoming clearer as they evolve, but callbacks to their respective legends are still easy to find. For Turtwig, its ties to the World Turtle are physical, found in its final form, Torterra. Besides the general turtle/tortoise silhouette, the small land formation and tree on Torterra&#39;s shell mirror the Earth settled of the World Turtle&#39;s shell. Piplup and its final evolution, Empoleon, share more than just physical characteristics with their deity. Aside from the trident-shaped crest, Empoleons are known for being haughty and proud, easily angered at those that disrespect them, recalling Poseidon&#39;s own pride and rage.

Chimchar is perhaps most closely aligned with its mystical origins. It shares a design with the Sun Wukong who inspired the most famous manga, the legendary Monkey King, which is physically very similar to Infernape. The Pokémon also mirrors the legend&#39;s personality, especially Ash&#39;s Chimchar. Sun Wukong is a trickster god of immeasurable power. Throughout his journeys in Journey to the West, he works on controlling his powers and chaotic personality with the help of Tang Sanzang. In the Pokémon anime, Chimchar deals with his trauma and unchecked rage when using Blaze. With Ash&#39;s help, he learns to take control of himself as he evolves, eventually becoming one of Ash&#39;s strongest Pokémon.




          

Starters are often overlooked as the humble beginnings of their oftentimes stronger evolutions, but they have their own strengths. Sinnoh&#39;s Pokémon take this concept to the next level, embracing gifts granted to them from their mythological inspirations. Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup are all mini-deities just waiting to meet their full potential. While most of their inspiration is cosmetic, their personality traits also harken back to their divine roots. Fans are welcome to debate which of their favorite Pokémon are the strongest, but when it comes to the Sinnoh region, even their starters&#39; origins prove that they are god-tier in the literal sense.
