## Literature Review

Moon Knight doesn&#39;t change his all-white look often, but in a new cosplay design his black and white costume gets a live-action upgrade the MCU needs.




The brutal vigilante known as Moon Knight has rapidly become one of the most popular superheroes in Marvel’s sprawling comic book multiverse, with Marc Spector’s all-white vigilante outfit giving him an instantly recognizable character design that ensures his foes see him coming from a mile away. And in a new cosplay, Moon Knight’s All-New, All-Different black and white costume gets a live-action redesign the MCU needs to take note of!




A cosplay design shared on social media via Instagram by Jason Sautner (@itsjarson), this prolific cosplayer has created and worn costumes that span the entirety of the pop culture spectrum, with each new look bringing to life a different character that fellow nerds can truly appreciate.


 

Dressing as other iconic comic book heroes like Marvel’s Daredevil, Iron Fist, Spider-Man, and Captain America, as well as DC Comics’ Batman, Scarecrow, Flash, Deathstroke, and Red Hood, Jason has also dabbled in creating designs putting him in the shoes of a Mandalorian from Star Wars fame and even Michael Myers from the long-running Halloween movie franchise.

                  Moon Knight Cosplay Finally Gives His Best Costume Some Respect   Moon Knight&#39;s gorgeous armored costume is recreated in a pitch-perfect cosplay from kreedcosplay, who does justice to the former Avenger&#39;s look.   





 Moon Knight&#39;s Best Comic Costume Gets A Cosplay Design The MCU Needs 
          

A costume that debuted during Marvel’s All-New, All-Different initiative in 2015, this lightly armored look, originally drawn by Declan Shalvey, has become a fan-favorite Moon Knight design ever since it was first introduced. Also worth noting is that Moon Knight did have another two-toned black and white design when he premiered way back in 1975’s Werewolf By Night #32, his more recent MCU debut saw him dressed in a completely different kind of costume not seen in the comics, one that leaned into Moon Knight’s Egyptians roots by having its cloth supernaturally wrap around his body as if he were a mummy come back to life. Luckily for fans of both designs, Jason found a perfect way to merge the two.

A unique live-action look seen across eight different photos, Jason brings a sense of realism and detailed craftsmanship to a fairly straightforward comic design that does wonders to set this costume apart from any Moon Knight outfit seen before it. Wearing a black bodysuit, white boots, and cape, Jason brandishes white shoulder and chest armor similar to his comic counterpart, but “mummy wraps” the chest piece to fall in line with the character’s MCU adaptation. Also wearing gauntlets with hidden crescent-shaped throwing stars stuck in them, this cosplay is made complete by an MCU-like white hood and a textured black mask with comic-accurate all-white eyes, officially completing a ghostly, moonlit look that pays homage to two different versions of the character.






 New Moon Knight Cosplay Shows What The MCU Is Missing 
          

Unfortunately for fans, Marc Spector’s iteration of the character just bit the big one in last year’s Moon Knight #30, but with a new hero donning a totally different costume in the recently released Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1, it might not be long before Jason Sautner (@itsjarson) tries his hand at creating another cosplay based on this iconic Marvel superhero. But until that time comes, Moon Knight’s best comic costume has been perfectly immortalized in a live-action design that proves this look can not only work in the MCU but deserves to be the main outfit of the character moving forward.
