## Literature Review

After gaining a new party member, Frieren and her friends are heading to the northern lands in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #7.




Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #6 featured some of the best animation in the series so far, setting a high standard for episode #7 to meet. However, with all the care being put into the adaptation of this underrated series by Studio Madhouse, it will likely live up to those expectations. This is good especially since the series may feature a bit more action in its coming arc.





 What Time Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #7 Releases 
          

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #7 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, October 20. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 20 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 10 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #6? 
          

Much like episode #5, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #6 was divided into two parts. The first followed up on the events of the previous episode, with Stark helping Frieren and Fern to defeat a dragon. While Stark initially doubted himself, his fight against the dragon was extraordinary and showed he is a great warrior like his mentor Eisen. The second half saw Frieren, Fern, and Stark stopped in a border town on their way North due to dangerous fighting with the remnants of the Demon King&#39;s army. This downtime lets Stark elaborate on his goals, sharing with Fern that he wants to have fun adventures to tell Eisen before he dies, providing a nice contrast to Fern&#39;s immortal mentor Frieren. Luckily when the castellan of the town found out about Frieren&#39;s journey, he let her party pass without fuss.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #7 will Explore the North 
          

Now that Frieren&#39;s party has arrived in the North they will likely encounter some of the fighting mentioned in the latest episode. They may even encounter high-ranking demons like the one Frieren and Fern fought in episode #3. However, with Frieren and Fern&#39;s powerful magic abilities and Stark&#39;s physical battle prowess, it would likely be hard for any demon to present Frieren&#39;s party with a major threat. Luckily regardless of how intense the stakes are, episode #6&#39;s dragon fight shows that the show is willing to go all out on its action animation, meaning that any such battles will likely also be visual spectacles.

While fights may be exciting, the revolutionary Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End likely won&#39;t veer too far from its general episodic formula of having its central characters travel from town to town helping people, which is what makes it so refreshing. However, the towns that they encounter in episode #7 may be a bit more distraught than those they visited previously. Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #7 will thus serve as an important indication of how much the tone of the show will change now that Frieren and her friends are approaching the realm of the Demon King.




Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #7 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 20, 2023.
