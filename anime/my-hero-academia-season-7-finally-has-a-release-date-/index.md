## Literature Review

The release date for My Hero Academia&#39;s seventh season has been finally officially announced.




The release date of the popular shōnen anime My Hero Academia&#39;s season 7 has been finally confirmed after the news was previously leaked online. The series is coming off a successful season 6, which saw the anime&#39;s most brutal arc, and with the Hero Society in shambles after the all-out war between heroes and villains, the seventh installment promises a great follow-up to the cliffhanger.




The news was leaked on X and then officially confirmed a few days later by the official X account of My Hero Academia and by Crunchyroll, who will be streaming season 7.


 

The official sources confirmed that My Hero Academia season 7 will be released in the Spring of 2024. Although the leak stated that the release would happen in April, there is no mention of a month in the official press release, which also includes a new key visual.

 My Hero Academia Season 7 Will Strive To Live Up To Season 6&#39;s Incredible Standards 
          




The seventh season was announced back in March 2023 following the end of the sixth season. Although this was great news, it was more or less expected since a new season of the anime is released yearly. Based on previous year&#39;s trends, season 7 was assumed to be released in 2024. My Hero Academia joins the fray of popular anime expected to release next year, like Solo Leveling, Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War part 3, and many more.


 

Season 7 will pick up right where the previous season left off, with America&#39;s top hero Star and Stripes rushing to Japan to help her dear friend All Might and the hero society who are on the brink of collapse. This arc will be the first to expand on the series&#39; worldbuilding and show other powerful heroes from all around the world. With All For One only growing stronger by the minute, Deku and his friends will be relieved to have such a capable ally on their side. There will most likely be 2 cours with 24-25 episodes as is standard for the series. The second cour will adapt the U.A. Traitor arc, where Deku investigates a traitor in their midst.




It&#39;s possible that the leak ruined the chance of this news being announced at Jump Festa 2024, where announcements and trailers for the biggest anime are made every year. My Hero Academia is one of the most popular anime of all time and is a great contributor to anime&#39;s success globally. The series is nearing its end, and this season will be building up to the show&#39;s most violent and heartbreaking war. More information about the season such as staff, cast, and exact release date will be made available soon, so keep checking Screen Rant&#39;s Anime section for all the latest information on My Hero Academia.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
