## Literature Review

The latest chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex cements Boruto as the strongest ninja in history.





In just 3 years, Boruto has managed to become more powerful than any ninja in history, including his father Naruto. He was always blessed, being able to use 3 elements and the powerful and mysterious Jougan. Now, chapter 3 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has cemented his status as the Naruto franchise&#39;s strongest shinobi ever.




          

Boruto&#39;s new Rasengan Uzuhiko utilizes the planet to completely incapacitate an enemy. This is the first technique the young ninja has used since he ran away from the village 3 years ago, and it certainly won&#39;t be his only new power. The technique easily ended Boruto&#39;s fight with Code, which hints at its true power. Code is almost certainly stronger than Jigen, who was in turn at least on par with Naruto and Sasuke. With the raw strength of Uzuhiko plus other techniques he hasn&#39;t shown yet, Boruto is simply unmatched in power.

                  The Boruto Anime&#39;s Second Part Won&#39;t Begin With the Big Time Skip, So Where Will it Begin?   While the time skip is happening soon in the Boruto manga, when the anime comes back it will have a lot of ground to cover before getting there.   





 Boruto Has Already Surpassed Naruto 
          

Naruto set a precedent for strength time and time again that almost nobody can match. Each transformation helped him rise through the ranks of the most powerful ninja, and Naruto&#39;s ultra-powerful Baryon Mode was his strongest but also had the biggest drawback. Boruto inherited his father&#39;s talent and his mother&#39;s wits, making him a formidable shinobi at 12. With that level of smarts and power plus the training by Sasuke, Boruto was on the path toward glory. However, his time to shine has come much earlier than expected.

At 15 in Two Blue Vortex, Boruto Uzumaki is now the strongest ninja of all time. Although the results from his 3 years of training haven&#39;t been fully shown, his new jutsu is so powerful it&#39;s difficult to think of any other ninja that could match him. Considering the fact that he hasn&#39;t used Karma, which significantly boosts his strength and techniques, fans haven&#39;t even seen the full extent of the Konoha exile&#39;s power. There&#39;s also the possibility that he can now use Sage Mode, as the chapter hinted at Boruto&#39;s training with Kashin Koji and the Toads. He might have even mastered Jougan, which could be the most overpowered Dojutsu in the series.




Two Blue Vortex is only beginning, and with a sneak peek at Boruto&#39;s new strength, it&#39;s hard to argue against his strength. Boruto has always been destined to be stronger than his dad as he is much smarter and more talented. The only thing missing was experience and a situation dire enough to force his growt. Boruto, who has had a cozy life, being suddenly chased out of his home was the catalyst for Boruto&#39;s incredible growth. Boruto&#39;s true strength will be revealed and accepted as the strongest as the series goes on.
