## Literature Review

Starfire becomes Nightwing&#39;s knight in purple armor with one feat that is as disgusting as it is badass, proving she has the grit to lead the Titans. 




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans #7!




The events of Beast World have seen Starfire rise to a level of creative brilliance and sheer badassery that rivals even Nightwing&#39;s own leadership prowess. Her latest stomach-turning but genius problem-solving bout not only single-handedly saves the Titan leader himself but also provides DC&#39;s heroes with a method to reverse the animal transformations plaguing Earth&#39;s population, showcasing the vital role she plays in the DCU&#39;s latest crisis event.

In Titans #7, crafted by Tom Taylor and Travis Moore, the Titans continue to grapple with the infestation of Beast Boy&#39;s Garro spores, which have transformed Earth&#39;s population into mindless, violent animal hybrids. Among the afflicted is Nightwing, who succumbs to the spores and takes on the form of a fox.

          




However, Dick&#39;s foxy predicament is short-lived, courtesy of Starfire&#39;s unorthodox yet remarkably effective intervention. She ingeniously lures the spore out of Nightwing&#39;s body and then uses her mouth as the ultimate weapon, biting the creature in half.


 Starfire Frees Nightwing From His Beast Form by Chomping the Garro Spore 
          

In a previous issue, it was revealed that the transformative spores will exit their current host&#39;s body if they detect a stronger host. The moment a spore departs, the afflicted individual returns to their normal state. However, a spore will only willingly leave a host to infect a more powerful being. Leveraging this knowledge, Starfire strategically slams Dick&#39;s fox form against the wall, demonstrating that she is the stronger entity. She then opens her mouth invitingly, and as the spore leaps from Dick&#39;s mouth to hers, she bites down, effectively killing the spore before spitting it out.




Kori&#39;s approach to liberating Dick from the Garro spore might not be the most refined or elegant and certainly falls into the realm of the downright disgusting, but its effectiveness can&#39;t be denied. She successfully frees Dick without risking infection to herself or others. This unorthodox method showcases her creativity and ingenuity and also underscores her confidence in her physical prowess and ability to execute unconventional solutions. Not every Titan would possess the reflexes or courage to execute the lure, chomp, and spit spore removal method. Hence, her forward-thinking approach and self-assuredness make her an ideal leader for the Titans.

                  Sorry Raven: But Starfire Has a New Best Friend and Together Theyâ€™re Unstoppable   Starfire and Raven may have once been DC&#39;s ultimate best friends forever duo, but it looks like Kori has a new bestie and together their undefeatable.   



 Starfire Creates an Effective, Albeit Unconventional Beast World Cure 
          




Starfire&#39;s de-sporing technique presents a potential solution for DC&#39;s heroes grappling with the Beast World crisis. Among the significant challenges are the transformed heroes and villains who, as animal hybrids, possess enhanced abilities that elevate their threat level. With Kori&#39;s lure, bite, and spit spore removal method there is now a way to effectively neutralize the danger posed by the afflicted. Batman, who is currently a wolf, would be a prime candidate since Superman could easily de-spore him using Kori&#39;s technique. Starfire&#39;s innovative method may have just provided the heroes with their best weapon to confront and overcome this crisis.

Titans #7 is available now from DC Comics.
