## Literature Review

Featuring protagonists who are either reincarnated in the same world or a completely different one instead, these manhwa titles are some of the best.




Reincarnation or isekai has become an increasingly common theme across all kinds of media in recent years, but, for some reason or another, it seems that it resonates particularly well with creators and fans of the manhwa medium. As such, there is no shortage of options when looking for the best reincarnation manhwa to read.
From typical isekai stories whose protagonists suddenly wake up in fictional words, usually those depicted in the novels they were reading, to reincarnation stories that see their protagonists given a new chance at life hundreds or even thousands of years later in the same world, there are multiple common ways for authors to approach this theme. The one common link between them is that the reincarnated characters are often superior to their peers, keeping their memories and skills from past lives, making them truly overpowered.









 








 10  The Archmage Returns After 4000 Years Shines Through Its Rich Worldbuilding 
Based on the Novel by Nakhasan, Written by Barnicle, &amp; Illustrated by Deok-Yong Kim
        

After reaching the peak of magic and becoming the greatest mage in history, Lucas Trowman was condemned by a Demigod to spend eternity losing his mind. 4,000 years later, he manages to escape the abyss, taking over the body of Frei Blake, a student who, despite attending the prestigious magical Westroad Academy, seems to have no aptitude for magic.
This means little to Lucas however, as nothing can stop him from embarking on his quest of revenge, seeking to reclaim his throne at the top of the magic world. The premise may seem generic initially, but The Archmage Returns After 4000 Years stands out through its rich world and complex characters.

After her 18th life was tragically cut short, Ji-Eum seeks to rekindle her love, unaware of the implications of her actions.
