## Literature Review

One-Punch Man Chapter explains the origins of the friendly monster, Manako, and the story she offers is a surprisingly wholesome one.




Warning: Spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter #195The monster known as Manako (or &#34;Oculette&#34; in the English version) is a One-Punch Man fan-favorite character, and her monstrous origins have finally been revealed - and they&#39;re shockingly wholesome. Manako, who first appeared during the Monster Association arc when Saitama was wandering the interior of their base, quickly became a hit with fans, and has proven important in the most recent arc.






One-Punch Man Chapter #195 in the Japanese release is equivalent to Chapter #193 in the English Viz Media release.




Manako encountered God alongside Saitama and Flashy Flash, and as a result, Flashy Flash had been looking for her, only recently tracking her down thanks to King and Saitama. In Chapter #195, Saitama and Manako accompany Flashy Flash to the Hero Association HQ basement, where attempts are being made to de-monsterize combatants from the Super Fight arc, over 100 chapters ago. Manako grows worried that they might attempt to de-monsterize her as well, and she insists that she was never human to begin with.

          

Instead, Manako claims to have been split off from the puppet monster, Gyoro Gyoro, which was grown in a tank to act as a remote-controlled body for Psykos (the true leader of the Monster Association), and states that she believes she was his conscience.





 Manako is One-Punch Man&#39;s Most Unique Monster Yet 
          

Monsters in One-Punch Man are generally always evil, and often relish causing suffering. Many different kinds of monsters have been seen at this point, and each of them seems to be a little different. Manako&#39;s explanation of her origins suggests that she was an artificial being, rather than a naturally occurring monster, or a human that underwent &#34;monsterification&#34;. When Manako was first found, she was merely hiding in a bathroom deep within the Monster Association&#39;s HQ, desperate not to become a part of the battle raging on the surface. That alone showed that Manako wasn&#39;t an average monster.

While Manako is merely speculating about what part of Gyoro Gyoro she once was, the fact that she would even compare herself to a conscience is noteworthy on its own. Having a conscience suggests a capacity for remorse, something that few other monsters have been shown to have. Manako&#39;s main concern has consistently been survival, and while she did consider attacking Saitama and Flashy Flash at one point, that was mostly motivated by fear that they would kill her when she was no longer useful. Even top hero Blast realized that Manako was no real threat, and actually saved her alongside Saitama and Flashy Flash.






 Manako Proves That Monsters Are Not Necessarily Evil In One-Punch Man 
          

Manako&#39;s increased presence in the story has definitely shown a different side of monsters than anything that had been seen previously. Whereas before, it seemed like wiping out the monsters was the only solution to save humanity, it now looks like there might be some monsters who could be reasoned with, and who might be able to live in society. Of course, as the threat has begun to escalate from mere monsters to the evil God itself, it makes some sense that One-Punch Man might reveal a different side to the monsters, even if for now it&#39;s only Manako.

One-Punch Man is available from Viz Media&#39;s Shonen Jump app.
