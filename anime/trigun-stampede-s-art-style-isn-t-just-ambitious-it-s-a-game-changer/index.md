## Literature Review

3D anime are the wave of future, but for the sake of higher quality. An unlikely marriage of two art forms are revolutionizing anime forever.





The frames and perspectives in sci-fi series are hard to do in a 2D environment. Animators had to use CGI to even animate Vash&#39;s chase scene in Trigun: Stampede episode 2. With tracking technology and a pre-made model of the environment, only character and gun effects have to be coordinated. Without CGI, the amount of money required for this would have been astronomical, and that is for one scene. The program Deep Canvas was used to help with drawing 2D over 3D models, incorporating the best of both. Studio Ghibli and Disney used this technology in masterpieces like Tarzan, Treasure Planet, and Boro the Caterpillar.





 Trigun Stampede Sets a Precedent For the Future of Anime 

 

 One thing that jumps out about the series is its reinterpretation of classic characters, and the anime&#39;s shift to 3D actually makes some of these new character designs possible. Series antagonist Millions Knives could not have had his million knives attack animated in such a grand tornado with each individual knife rendered and perfectly identical without 3D models. Despite the aids given by CGI, it took Studio Orange a full two years to develop the tech required to mimic human facial expressions and flow as well as 2D hand-drawn can. Only by putting so much work just into the technology of Trigun Stampede&#39;s animation was the series able to look as good as it did.

Quality and cost are so hard to meet in today&#39;s economy, but having 3D elements helps cut the cost. Generally, 3D is not implemented much in Japanese animation due to a variety of cultural and economic factors. Hayao Miyazaki is a huge proponent for the human soul seen in art made by human hands. An example of this is perfectly shown in episode 6 of Trigun Stampede. Wolfwood&#39;s backstory is seen in this older art form. Wolfwood&#39;s childhood is not realistic, it is idealized and exaggerated with warm colors and then transitions to vivid ones. Idealization is what 2D animation specializes in.






 Trigun Stampede&#39;s Studio Makes a Strong Case for More 3D Anime 
          

Trigun Stampedeâ€™s production company Studio Orange has been a main proponent and user of 3D animation in recent years. The lead director Kiyotaka Waki who made the reboot also did other 3D anime like BEASTARS. Trigun was not popular in Japan after the initial release, but explosively popular in America, perhaps because of the Western and sci-fi combo. At Sakura con 2023, there was discussion of the second season of Trigun and Waki was willing to take a chance on using 3D CGI because of the series&#39; popularity in the West. Given the series&#39; warm reception, Trigun Stampede&#39;s stunning animation may just be a sign of things to come for the anime industry.
