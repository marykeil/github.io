## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1081 will feature a major fight against the series&#39; newest enemy Admiral Ryokugyu as he attempts to take down Luffy.




The end of episode #1080 established a new villain for the Straw Hats to face in One Piece episode #1081. In facing this enemy, the Straw Hats have a chance to show how much they have grown over the course of the post time skip saga. This battle could also potentially set the status quo of the series going forward and show fans what to expect in later arcs.

 What Happened in Episode #1080 of One Piece? 
          




Episode #1080 continued the Fire Festival, with many of the Straw Hats taking part in the festivities. Robin instead spent this time finding the Poneglyph in Wano. After discovering it, Tenguyama revealed his true identity as Oden&#39;s father. The mysterious old man went on to reveal that the Ancient Weapon Pluton is located under Wano. With the defeat of Big Mom and Kaido, Luffy and Buggy rose to become the two new Yonko in their place. Meanwhile, the admiral Ryokugyu arrived on Wano and fought King, Queen, and the other remaining Beast Pirates. He was actually able to defeat them all pretty handily showing he is a major threat.



 One Piece Episode #1081 Will See The Straw Hats Fight Ryokugyu 
          

With the Beast Pirates dispatched, Ryokugyu is headed for a direct confrontation with the Straw Hat Pirates. This will be the first Admiral they have faced since they encountered Fujitora on Dressrosa. Given the Admirals are some of the World Government&#39;s most powerful soldiers, this will be a great opportunity to see what the Straw Hats can now do against such an intimidating force. Ryokugyu himself is even scarier given his actions in episode #1080, as both King and Queen are incredibly strong opponents, but he was able to defeat them much more easily than the Straw Hats did.




All that being said, in a battle between Ryokugyu, the Straw Hats, and all their allies on Wano, One Piece&#39;s newest Admiral has a major disadvantage in numbers. This may make the fight somewhat less dangerous. However, the Navy&#39;s new aggressiveness in dealing with Luffy is likely to continue in future arcs, which makes One Piece episode #1081 a good barometer for how the new status quo of the series has changed things.

Catch One Piece episode #1081 when it releases on Crunchyroll on October 28, 2023.
