## Literature Review

Some of the best episodes and arcs in anime are made up of flashbacks, as seen in Naruto, Berserk, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica.





On the other side, at their best, a flashback is so well-placed and woven so seamlessly into the narrative that it’s more exciting than whatever it’s cut away from. It enriches the story and completes viewers’ understanding of a character. At absolute best, it can be one of the most emotional and moving events in the whole show.









 








 10  And So Kyouya Met Him – Ouran High School Host Club 
        

One of the best qualities of the Ouran High School Host Club anime adaptation is that all the Hosts get a flashback episode showing how they first met Tamaki. Each one makes clearer how each of them were isolated and miserable before he brought them together. However, the most compelling of these episodes centers around Kyouya Ohtori.
As the youngest of four brothers, having a strained relationship with his distant father, Kyouya has an understandable chip on his shoulder. While he&#39;s initially cold and impatient with Tamaki, it&#39;s Tamaki who successfully breaks him out of his self-loathing attitude and encourages him to stop holding himself back from living as he wants. It&#39;s beautifully symbolized by the white canvas Kyouya once envisioned his life as now being lush with color.





 9  Heavy Weather Part 2 – JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure 
        

One of the best JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure villains, Enrico Pucci, has some background revealed over the course of the show, but only relating to his relationship with Dio. Jolyne&#39;s silent ally, Weather Report, had his memory stolen with no recollection of his true identity. When Weather regains his memories, he&#39;s decidedly angrier and more vicious, and after seeing his past.
Weather and Pucci are twin brothers, separated at birth. When an older Pucci found out the truth, he realized his younger sister was unwittingly dating their brother, his plan to secretly break them up nearly gets Weather killed by a racist gang, resulting in their sister&#39;s death, and activates both their Stands in grief. After removing Weather’s memories and locking him up, Pucci devotes himself fully to Dio.





 8  Turn Back The Pendulum – Bleach 
        

Composed entirely of a flashback, Turn Back the Pendulum remains one of the most popular arcs in Bleach. Sosuke Aizen is one of the best twist villains in anime, but he hid his true nature from his comrades for years. He frames fellow Soul Reaper Kisuke Urahara and gets him and his team exiled when they interfere with his experiments.
It&#39;s a compelling and tragic story, with its foregone conclusion of the Visored&#39;s downfall, and shows other well-known characters in their youth as well. Staid and aloof Byakuya used to be highly emotional and eager to prove himself. Aizen&#39;s tricks didn’t work flawlessly on everybody, but he was smart enough to get rid of anyone who suspected him.





 7  Berserk – Berserk 
        

Much of Berserk&#39;s story is technically told through a series of flashbacks. Its first episode introduces viewers to Guts, a rugged mercenary known for slaughtering demons and evil humans alike as the Black Swordsman. However, Guts didn&#39;t always roam the land alone.
Once, he was a member of Band of the Hawk, under the command of Griffith, who became particularly attached to him. With Guts&#39; strength and Griffith’s charisma, the group grew stronger and came to wield some political power. But as Griffith pushed farther and makes dangerous enemies, Guts was forced to fight harder than ever before to protect himself and his loved ones.





 6  The Birth Of NERV – Neon Genesis Evangelion 
        

For much of the show, both of Shinji&#39;s parents are figures of mystery, especially his late mother Yui. This episode sheds some light on their backgrounds and their intentions in creating the EVA program. After Shinji&#39;s spiritual contact with his mother, this gives viewers a more grounded view of who Yui was.
Fuyutsuki, one of the few people who knew Gendo and Yui in their youth, flashes back to Second Impact and Yui&#39;s death. They reveal that while Gendo has always operated on his own agenda, his motive for ushering in Third Impact has changed from personal ambition to reuniting with Yui, and he’ll sacrifice anyone to achieve it. Back in the present, Kaji is just the latest person to discover this the hard way.





 5  The Dwarf In The Flask – Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 
        

Despite their differing feelings about their father Van Hohenheim, neither Edward nor Alphonse know or understand him. Hohenheim&#39;s years of absence and his furtiveness when he does reunite with his sons doesn&#39;t help his case. This episode reveals his deepest secrets and his connection to the main villain, Father.
Hohenheim was once a slave in the kingdom of Xerxes, whose blood was used to create the first Homunculus, who quickly befriends Hohenheim. But behind his back, Homunculus convinced the king to sacrifice his subjects for immortality, only to wipe out all Xerxes to give himself and the horrified Hohenheim immortal bodies instead. For centuries, Hohenheim has been fighting to stop the creature that came from his blood: the task for which he left his home and family – his true desire – when Ed and Al were young.





 4  Rem Savarem – Trigun 
        

In Trigun&#39;s latest anime adaptation, Trigun Stampede, Vash&#39;s backstory is the first thing viewers see. The original anime keeps both Vash&#39;s brother and his adoptive mother under wraps until much later on. The episode that bears the latter&#39;s name sheds a lot of light on why Vash is the way he is, and what he is truly up against.
As alien children, Vash and his twin Knives were raised by humans on their way to populate a new planet. Rem takes on the majority of the parent role, trying to pass on her morals and kindness to them. While Vash makes her words his way of life, Knives is more strongly impacted by his abuse at the hands of the other crew, to the point where he not only kills the entire fleet, but is still trying to rid Planet Gunsmoke of humanity as an adult.





 3  Everything Starts Aboard the Advena Avis – Baccano! 
        

The most mysterious characters in Baccano!&#39;s eccentric cast are the immortals: humans who never age, and can only die by being &#34;devoured&#34; by another immortal. This episode flashes back to 1711, where viewers meet thirty hopeful alchemists: noticeably fewer than the ones that survived to 1931.
Turns out that all you need to do to win eternal life is call up a demon and ask. Though all the alchemists aboard – plus Czeslaw, whose guardian made him immortal for his own nefarious reasons – get what they want, that same night Szilard goes on a rampage and devours half of them. Being devoured is terrifying enough on its own, but being trapped aboard a ship in the middle of the ocean just doubles the horror.





 2  Roar, Chidori! Brother Vs. Brother – Naruto 
        

Statistically, half of Naruto&#39;s episode count is filler content, and even many of the canon episodes are filled with flashback after flashback. By the back half of Shippuden, it’s understandable if audiences forget that the show can actually do flashbacks effectively. However, they might have to go back pretty far into the series to find one.
This episode launches one of the best revenge stories in anime. When Sasuke hears that his brother Itachi is back in town and hunting Naruto, he races to find them, the whole time flashing back to Itachi&#39;s massacre of their clan. He purposely left Sasuke as the sole survivor, claiming it was to give himself a worthy opponent one day, and now Sasuke is terrified that he still isn&#39;t strong enough to protect his loved ones from his brother.





 1  I Won&#39;t Rely On Anyone Anymore – Puella Magi Madoka Magica 
        

From her first appearance in the show, both Madoka and the audience can tell that something is off with Homura. Cold and mysterious, she&#39;s vehemently obsessed with keeping Madoka from becoming a magical girl. Here, we finally find out exactly how badly Homura wants to prevent this and why.
Homura has been stuck in a time loop for countless resets, because the wish she made to become a magical girl was to protect Madoka. Madoka is doomed to either die in battle or become the worst of all witches if Homura doesn&#39;t figure out how to change their fate. After years of living the same month over and over again, Homura is jaded, but remains determined to finally save Madoka&#39;s life somehow.
Flashbacks in anime are hard to pull off. Making an entire episode or arc centered on a particular flashback can be even more of a challenge. But when pulled off correctly, they can be the most compelling episodes in anime.
