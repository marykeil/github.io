# Team Rocket s Most Effective Scheme Turned Pokémon s World Against Ash


## SUMMARY 



  Team Rocket&#39;s disguise as Ash and his friends in the Pokémon XY series successfully ruins Ash&#39;s reputation and isolates him from law enforcement.   Their impersonation scheme, although flawed, causes more trouble for Ash than any attempt to steal Pikachu.   This plan showcases the effectiveness of Team Rocket&#39;s disguises and highlights their potential for future success.

## Literature Review

One Team Rocket plan saw them using their disguise abilities to ruin Ash&#39;s life, and their scheme had a shocking degree of success.




Team Rocket rarely sees success in the Pokémon anime, but one of their most effective tricks ever involved putting their disguise abilities to use to make Ash a wanted person throughout Kalos. By disguising themselves as Ash and his friends, Team Rocket were able to destroy Ash&#39;s reputation before he even got into town.




In the episode &#34;Heroes - Friend and Faux Alike!&#34; from the Pokémon XY series, Team Rocket hatches a new plan, with James disguising himself as Ash, his Inkay as Pikachu, Jessie as Serena, and Meowth as Bonnie. Now impersonating the heroes, Team Rocket went around stealing things, bullying children, and generally causing mayhem, all the while introducing themselves as Ash and his friends.

          

The situation was so bad that when Ash and co. actually arrived at the Pokémon Center, Officer Jenny came to speak with them, leaving Clemont (whom Team Rocket didn&#39;t impersonate) on his own.


 Team Rocket&#39;s Ash Disguise Caused Him the Most Trouble of Any Costume 
          




Team Rocket have disguised themselves in many ways over the years; James even once impersonated Professor Oak successfully. While Ash and friends fall for their disguises just about every time, the disguise is usually part of a trap to steal Pikachu, of course, and that&#39;s when these plans typically fall apart. However, by using their incredible disguises to impersonate Ash, they caused him far more trouble than any attempt at stealing Pikachu has. Had they continued with this scheme, giving Ash a bad reputation across Kalos, it would&#39;ve been far more effective at isolating Ash and putting Pikachu in a position to be more easily stolen.

Instead of trying to trick Ash, tricking other people about who Ash is was astonishingly potent, even in spite of the flaws in their costumes (as Inkay doesn&#39;t look a thing like Pikachu, and continues hovering as it always does). Of course, ruining Ash&#39;s life in this way would only be a means to an end, as the goal is still ultimately Pikachu, but forcing Ash to stay outside of towns and avoid law enforcement that would normally help him, such as Officer Jenny, would make him a much easier target. In the latter half of the episode, they actually go on to disguise themselves as scientists, and trick Clemont into helping them create machines to help steal Pikachu.




Like all Team Rocket schemes, though, this one eventually ended in failure, with Ash and friends confronting their look-a-likes, at which time Team Rocket dropped the disguise. Still, there&#39;s no reason they couldn&#39;t have reused this idea in another town; they already had the disguises, and the effect was shockingly successful at putting Ash at a disadvantage. It goes to show that Team Rocket&#39;s disguises are actually quite good, so it&#39;s no wonder that Ash and his friends fall for them so often. While this scheme to disguise themselves as Ash didn&#39;t ultimately end with Pikachu in their possession, it was still one of Team Rocket&#39;s most successful plans throughout the whole Pokémon anime.
