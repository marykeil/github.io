# Black Clover Isn t Just Underappreciated, It s One of the Generation s Best Shonen


## SUMMARY 



  Black Clover challenges the typical &#34;feel good&#34; message of shonen by exploring a darker worldview where class systems determine success.   The symbolic magical system in Black Clover adds depth to the story and reinforces its dreary perspective on power and hierarchy.   The series effectively uses foreshadowing and subverted mysteries to create compelling storylines and develop its characters, like Asta.

## Literature Review

Black Clover flies under the radar in the anime and manga community, but it&#39;s actually one of the most important of today&#39;s shonen.




Black Clover by Yuki Tabata has built up a negative reputation for ostensibly being the least successful among the longer-running shonen series, an incorrect assumption that was recently exacerbated by the series moving from Shonen Jump to Jump GIGA. Other critics also love to point out its many parallels to Naruto, though every shonen borrows heavily from its predecessors, and Black Clover is known for taking ubiquitous tropes and putting an interesting spin on them.




A deep and impartial look at Black Clover will prove that the series has continuously been underappreciated and it deserves a spot among this generation&#39;s greatest shonen, including more popular series like My Hero Academia. In addition to revolutionizing shonen tropes like friendship and stagnant fighting formulas, Black Clover&#39;s worth has been proved multiple times during the course of its long run.


 Unprecedented Dark Message 
          

Black Clover has a darker moral to its story than most shonen typically do. Interestingly, the manga initially kept with shonen&#39;s usual &#34;feel good&#34; message of overcoming the odds by having two peasants - the weakest class system in its magical world of commoners, nobles and royals - ascend above their class through effort and skill. This was especially the case with Yuno because he obtained the coveted four-leaf clover grimoire and had a spirit to serve him. But then the massive twist in Black Clover chapter #233 revealing that Yuno was actually royalty proved that he was only strong because of his royal blood, reinforcing his universe&#39;s dark worldview that only those who are born in certain class systems can achieve the greatest of heights.




Black Clover also explores this dynamic from the other end of the spectrum. Because of his status as a peasant, Magna Swing couldn&#39;t participate in the same training regime as his fellow teammates did in the Heart Kingdom. He not only had to put in more effort than his higher-born comrades, but his extra work still didn&#39;t generate the same results. Black Clover even stripped away what made the commoner Captain Jack the Ripper special. His Slash Magic was initially one of a kind and could adapt to any ability or magic power by cutting through anything. But then chapter #345 introduced Yosuga Mushogatake from Hino Country, who could also cut through anything with his katana. It doesn&#39;t help that Jack the Ripper dies soon afterward before getting to disprove Black Clover&#39;s depressing message.



 Metaphorical Magic 
          




Black Clover&#39;s highly symbolic magical system not only serves as a powerful metaphor but also helps augment the series&#39; dreary perspective. One of Black Clover&#39;s most effective images derives from Yuno&#39;s Wind and Star magic, the latter of which is associated with his royal heritage. It&#39;s noteworthy that Yuno&#39;s use of Star magic eventually causes William Vangeance to relinquish his title as leader of the Golden Dawn and name Yuno the squad&#39;s newest captain in Black Clover #355. It wasn&#39;t because of Yuno&#39;s Wind magic, which fans most readily correlate with Yuno&#39;s peasant upbringing.

Black Clover also subtly explained the villain Lucius Zogratis&#39; massive power through the thematic magical types possessed by himself and his siblings. On his own, Lucius possessed Soul magic, but then could suddenly wield Body, Blood, and Bone magics, allowing him to create clones of himself. Each type of magic serves as an essential part of the human anatomy, and together, they make a whole person. It&#39;s even more powerful when realizing that these powers came from his siblings who once made up the Dark Triad: Vanica possessed Blood Magic, Dante wielded Body Magic, and Zenon used Bone Magic.






 Foreshadowing 
          

Black Clover also makes effective use of foreshadowing, a form of storytelling that most fans consider to be one of anime&#39;s greatest strengths. Many times, foreshadowing can help explain controversial developments by revealing subtle hints during more innocuous moments. Without any context, Lucius&#39; ability to clone himself to a ridiculous degree in chapter #362 would seem like a sloppy way of positioning its villain as more of a threat. But introducing earlier how each Zogratis sibling possessed a power that symbolized a certain part of the human anatomy was an ingenious way to later explain Lucius Zogratis&#39; absurd cloning power.

Some uses of foreshadowing come in the form of characters making ostensibly meaningless statements that the series later builds upon for dramatic effect. Black Clover employed this during Asta and Yami&#39;s battle against the Eye of the Midnight Sun&#39;s leader Licht. During the fight, Yami is able to find time to inform Asta that he is from Hino. This would later foreshadow Asta&#39;s mysterious teleportation there in Black Clover #337, setting him up to learn the critical technique known as Zetten rather than randomly introducing a new place for Asta to go to.






 Subverted Mysteries 
          

Another critical form of storytelling that anime fans can&#39;t get enough of is the ever-elusive mystery. And while Black Clover has its own abundance of them, the series doesn&#39;t keep these questions unanswered until the very end. Instead, solving these mysteries creates other effective and more innovative storylines. An earlier example is the reveal of Yuno&#39;s true parents and background, which has yielded the series&#39; most symbolic use of magic to date. Keeping Yuno&#39;s heritage a secret would have prevented this from being explored.

Something similar happens when Black Clover reveals the identity of Asta&#39;s mother. There&#39;s a particular moment in the series when the fact that Asta doesn&#39;t know that the woman he saw in a vision was his mother creates a great deal of tension for the reader, because Asta&#39;s devil companion Liebe knows it and keeps the truth from Asta. Although Asta&#39;s reaction perfectly subverts expectations, this whole dynamic wouldn&#39;t have happened if the identity of Asta&#39;s mother had been kept a secret until the very end.






 A More Dynamically Layered Hero 
          

Liebe&#39;s connection to Asta also serves another purpose in that it helps prove just how three-dimensional Asta actually is. Black Clover initially made Asta appealing by forcing him to &#34;break&#34; the rules of his world to gain relevance since he didn&#39;t possess the normal means by which everyone else gained notoriety. The way he gained this was initially by chance, but the series later revealed that it was because of how much he and Liebe were alike, in turn, making Liebe the true protagonist of the story.

This connection is one of many examples that Black Clover continues to introduce to explain why Asta is his world&#39;s true hero. Overall, Black Clover suffers from a somewhat unfair judgment in the anime and manga community, which is mostly due the comparisons it draws to other series. If judged on its own, and for its own worth, however, it becomes clear that Black Clover is not only the most underappreciated shonen of its generation but also one of the most important ones.
