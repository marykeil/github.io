## Literature Review

The reanimated shinobi in Naruto&#39;s Ninja War Arc provided great entertainment for viewers but that was not the real reason for including them.





During the war, Obito commanded tens of thousands of White Zetsu soldiers, but they were not enough to face the combined powers of all the shinobi in the world. He struck a deal with Kabuto and got access to the strength of deceased shinobi that he summoned through the forbidden Edo Tensei jutsu: Akatsuki members, former Kages, Jinchuriki, and legendary fighters. This gave fans the chance to see in action some legendary shinobi from the past who would have otherwise never appeared in the series, and also gave Naruto a much-needed, albeit temporary, reunion with his dad. However, Kishimoto had another, more subtle reason for bringing so many &#34;zombies&#34; into his story, and it makes perfect sense in the context of the series.





 Naruto Needed Opponents He Could Actually Beat Without Compromising His Pacifism 
          

Masashi Kishimoto revealed in a 2014 interview with Fuji TV that the main purpose of the massive use of the Edo Tensei Jutsu was to switch up a common trope that he was employing. He says that after the Pain Arc, Naruto never really had any intention to kill his opponents, preferring instead to reason with them and try dialogue. This was in line with Naruto&#39;s development as a character after Pain asks him to come up with his own answer to the violence of the shinobi world. Kishimoto said that this was also the spirit of shonen manga (at the time) and he had to go down this path as well. However, in his opinion, this quickly killed the mood of the story, so he came up with the brilliant idea of reintroducing revived ninja.

                  Naruto&#39;s Sequel Shows The Dark Legacy Of The Shinobi World War   The Naruto sequel Konoha&#39;s Story shows a villain taking advantage of the dark legacy of the Fourth Shinobi World War to further his plans.   




Essentially, the Edo Tensei revenants (and the Zetsu clones too) are there so that the good guys can beat someone up, and kill them, without feeling too bad about it. Kishimoto thus aligned with the tropes of previous shonen manga but also managed to put his own unique twist into it. Of course, on top of that fans got to see previous favorite characters like Zabuza, Minato Namikaze, or the First and Second Hokage, plus a bunch of other great warriors of the past whose names were heard throughout the series. Finally, Edo Tensei was also a way to bring Madara into the story and fully resurrect him for the finale. The war was triggered by the threat of Madara leading the army so it was important to find a way to revive him.

          

Still, while fan service and plot necessities were also behind the massive use of Edo Tensei, what&#39;s most significant is that Kishimoto came up with this creative solution to make sure that, while Naruto&#39;s progression away from the path of violence continued, his story would not lose the action beats that made it so popular among fans.
