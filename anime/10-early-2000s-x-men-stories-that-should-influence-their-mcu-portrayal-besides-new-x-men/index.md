# 10 Early 2000s X-Men Stories That Should Influence Their MCU Portrayal (Besides New X-Men)


## SUMMARY 


 The early 2000s X-Men storylines are perfect for live-action adaptations in the MCU, with New X-Men being a standout choice (which is why it&#39;s excluded here). 
 The Ultimate Universe is ideal for adaptation, offering compressed and reworked narratives that make characters more badass, such as the Ultimate X-Men. 
 From standalone character storylines to arcs that could open the door for more storylines to come, these are the 10 best early 2000s X-Men storylines the MCU needs to adapt!

## Literature Review

Out of every X-Men comic book storyline from the early 2000s (from both the Ultimate Universe &amp; Earth-616), here are the 10 the MCU NEEDS to adapt! 




The early 2000s is filled with X-Men storylines that would be great for live-action adaptations and character portrayals in the MCU. Obviously, New X-Men is perhaps the first thing that comes to fans’ minds when they consider early 2000s X-Men comics, so it’s important to highlight some of the other X-Men storylines of that era that are also primed for the MCU treatment (with some minor tweaking to fit into the established MCU canon, of course).
This isn’t to say that these X-Men storylines are the most iconic, memorable, or impactful from the early 2000s - as House of M and Messiah Complex are two standout omissions. These storylines are simply some of the best that could smoothly fit into a new X-Men canon on the big screen, without extensive buildup for any one arc in particular. Here are 10 early 2000s X-Men stories that should influence their MCU portrayal! (Besides New X-Men).
            
 
 10 Ultimate Spider-Man Moments That Helped Marvel Websling Into the New Millennium 
The Ultimate Universe was created to modernize Marvel characters and storylines, &amp; Ultimate Spider-Man was the flagship. Here&#39;s the 10 best moments! 












 








 10  ‘Tomorrow People’ Is The Badass Origin The MCU’s X-Men Needs 
Ultimate X-Men #1-6 by Mark Miller and Adam Kubert


 







The very nature of the Ultimate Universe makes it perfect for live-action adaptation. Most adaptations take the source material and compress/rework it into a more streamlined narrative - and that’s exactly what the Ultimate Universe did with the original Earth-616 continuity. Not only that, but the Ultimate Universe (while it had its faults) made practically every character it touched way more badass, and the Ultimate X-Men were no exceptions.
The panels of these mutants coming together to form the original five is a storyline in and of itself, but Tomorrow People takes things even further by including not just the Sentinels, but also Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants. This one story arc could easily be X-Men’s first trilogy in the MCU, one which would perfectly lay the groundwork for decades of storytelling.





 9  ‘Return to Weapon X’ Needs To Be MCU’s Definitive Weapon X Storyline 
Ultimate X-Men #7-12 by Mark Miller and Adam Kubert


 







While much of what this comic arc does was already brought to live-action in X2: X-Men United (married with aspects of God Loves, Man Kills), that shouldn’t mean the MCU should neglect it. ‘Return to Weapon X’ is the perfect introduction to the villainous organization, as it forces every member of the X-Men to experience a mere taste of what Wolverine went through for years. Plus, it’s a great way to ease into Wolverine’s past naturally, while introducing some of the X-Men’s most iconic villains, like Sabretooth and Juggernaut along the way.
Obviously, the MCU would need to explore Wolverine’s personal time with Weapon X in a later film or series, but that shouldn’t happen until X-Men fans are proverbially slapped in the face with the horrors that Weapon X truly represents - and this storyline does that better than any other.





 8  ‘Brotherhood’ Is A ‘Logan’-Style Storyline In Modern Day 
Wolverine Vol. 3 #1-5 by Greg Rucka and Darick Robertson


 







Wolverine has no shortage of standalone storylines, but more often than not, they tend to veer into the mysteries of his past, or have immense implications on his future. The reason Logan was such a hit with fans is that it was a self-contained Wolverine storyline that was brutal and heartfelt. The only problem is, it was also set basically in a post-mutant world - not to mention he died at the end. Basically, movies like Logan can’t be made every day, and not every Wolverine standalone story needs to be profound or redefining. Sometimes Wolverine just needs to go on a mission that’s dark, gritty, and badass - and that’s exactly what ‘Brotherhood’ allows him to do.
‘Brotherhood’ is a self-contained storyline that takes place in the modern day, yet is ambiguous enough to have happened at any point in the wider X-Men canon, meaning this is a story the MCU can tell anytime it wants. Plus, the depiction of Wolverine that’s brought to the page by Darick Robertson needs to be how the character is portrayed in live-action - in all his short, grumpy glory.





 7  ‘You Always Remember Your First Love’ Should Redeem Gambit’s Live-Action Misfires 
Ultimate X-Men #13-14 by Chuck Austin and Essad Ribic
        

Gambit was supposed to get his own live-action standalone film before the idea was scrapped, which was news that came after his live-action debut in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It’s fair to say that both instances were misfires. While Gambit fans have suffered for years because of this, it’s actually a good thing, as the character’s slate has effectively been wiped clean, making him more than ready for the MCU treatment.
Given the previously unkept promise and ultimate disappointment regarding Gambit’s live-action depiction, there’s a significant amount of pressure on the MCU to get the character right, and this storyline is the perfect one to base him on. Gambit is shown as being more than just a former thief who became an X-Man, but a solo hero in his own right, with run-ins with New York City’s criminal underworld that could easily tie his story in with the likes of Echo or Daredevil.





 6  ‘The Most Dangerous Game’ Is The Perfect MCU Intro For Mojo &amp; Krakoa 
Ultimate X-Men #54-57 by Brian K. Vaughn and Stuart Immonen
        

Mojo is an unnecessarily complicated character with not that great of a payoff, story-wise. He’s a multidimensional producer who runs survival-style game shows that play on screens across the known universe, and he does this from his own pocket dimension known as the Mojoverse. Not only that, but his appearance is absolutely vile, and not ideal for a live-action depiction (as he’d practically be one hundred percent computer generated, which is a fad many fans are already sick of). In the Ultimate Universe, however, Mojo is introduced as a fairly normal looking person, who still has a survival-based television series, but one that’s filmed on Krakoa instead of a different dimension.
Adapting this storyline in the MCU would not only introduce Mojo in a way that’s much easier for fans to swallow than the Earth-616 version, but it’d also subtly introduce Krakoa, which could lead into a live-action adaptation of the X-Men’s more recent Krakoan Age.





 5  ‘Ultimate War’ Is A More Straightforward &#39;Avengers vs X-Men&#39; 
Ultimate War #1-4 by Mark Miller and Chris Bachalo
        

When the X-Men are introduced in the MCU, it’s a given that they will have to battle the Avengers. While Earth-616 has the iconic ‘Avengers vs X-Men’ storyline, that comic is rooted in deep lore, as it was the culmination of tensions that had been building since House of M, through Messiah Complex, and even the Dark Phoenix Saga. Basically, Avengers vs X-Men is a bit much to adapt. However, ‘Ultimate War’ is perfect for a live-action adaptation, as it’s rooted in a simple yet understandable misunderstanding that stems from the wider distrust of mutantkind, even among other superheroes.
An ‘Ultimate War’ MCU event wouldn’t be as grand as something like the upcoming Secret Wars, but it would perhaps be infinitely more impactful because it’s a closer to home story about division. Plus, this would effectively allow the X-Men to exist in their own separate corner of the MCU following its conclusion, as they wouldn’t want anything to do with other MCU heroes after that, and vice versa. This would immediately allow for more self-contained X-Men storylines moving forward, even in the shared universe of the MCU.





 4  ‘Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk’ Is The R-Rated Showdown MCU Fans Deserve 
Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #1-6 by Damon Lindelof and Leinil Francis Yu
        

‘Hulk vs Wolverine’ is a matchup that’s practically ingrained in the proverbial DNA of both characters. Indeed, Wolverine made his Marvel Comics debut fighting the Hulk, and the two have had a number of battles across multiple mediums since then. But they’ve never fought in live-action, so when they do, the MCU needs to make it count - and adapting this storyline is how it can do just that.
The story itself is simple enough: Wolverine is hired by Nick Fury to track down the Hulk - and honestly, that’s about as complex as a ‘Hulk vs Wolverine’ story needs to be. The reason this showdown stands out is due to its unparalleled brutality. The MCU has already delved into the realm of mature content with projects like Echo and the upcoming Deadpool 3, and the fight between Hulk and Wolverine needs to follow suit.





 3  ‘The Rise and Fall of the Shi’ar Empire’ Would Add The X-Men To The MCU’s Cosmic Side 
Uncanny X-Men #475-486 by Ed Brubaker and Billy Tan
        

The Shi’ar Empire is the X-Men’s doorway into the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe, which is something the MCU has explored extensively with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Eternals, and Captain Marvel. Therefore, when the X-Men are eventually introduced in the MCU, it only makes sense that the cosmic side of X-Men canon should be introduced fairly quickly as well, and this storyline is the perfect one to adapt.
Not only does ‘The Rise and Fall of the Shi’ar Empire’ give fans an in-depth look into the Shi’ar itself, but it does so through the eyes of Vulcan, the long-lost brother of Cyclops and Havok. If brought to the MCU, this storyline would add to Cyclops’ established character while opening the X-Men up to the cosmic side of the MCU in a unique and exciting way.





 2  ‘Cable’ Would Bring The X-Men Member’s Coolest Origin To The MCU 
Ultimate X-Men #75-78 by Robert Kirkman and Ben Oliver
        

Cable’s original origin story in Marvel Comics is absurdly convoluted, and not at all suited for a live-action adaptation. Even Deadpool 2 brushed over it with little explanation, but when Cable is brought into the MCU proper, his backstory will need to be told. However, that doesn’t mean the MCU will have to use his Earth-616 backstory, especially when his way cooler Earth-1610 origin is ripe for the picking.
In the Ultimate Universe, Cable isn’t Nathaniel Summers at all - he’s Wolverine. The distant-future version of Wolverine lost his healing factor and then lost his arm (replacing it with a robotic appendage), before traveling back in time to warn the X-Men about a horrific future that awaits them. In a way, Deadpool 2’s version of Cable could easily be the Ultimate version, meaning it’s not too late for the MCU to go in this direction with the character without any significant retcons.





 1  ‘The Dark Angel Saga’ Would Perfectly Set Up X-Men’s Most Badass Story In The MCU: The Age of Apocalypse 
Uncanny X-Force #11-18 by Rick Remender and Mark Brooks
        

While this X-Men storyline could in no way be one of the first told in the MCU, it would be the perfect bridge between the MCU’s Earth-616 (formerly Earth-199999) and Earth-295 aka the reality of the Age of Apocalypse. The Dark Angel Saga is something of a sequel to the Age of Apocalypse, where the X-Force of Earth-616 physically travel to that world and interact with their variants. If this is how fans are introduced to the Age of Apocalypse - as in, after the fact - then that opens the door wide open for a ‘prequel’ series that actually adapts the iconic crossover storyline from the ‘90s.
The Dark Angel Saga is a great storyline that deserves an adaptation, but its significance stretches far beyond its own storyline alone, as it could finally make a live-action Age of Apocalypse film franchise a reality, which is something that every MCU fan would love to see. For that reason, this is one of the 10 early 2000s X-Men stories that should be adapted by the MCU and influence their portrayals.
