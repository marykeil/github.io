## Literature Review

A colored page from chapter 403 of My Hero Academia reveals the color scheme of All Might&#39;s new armor, and it&#39;s pretty clear who he based it on.





Nana Shimura was the seventh person to wield the power of One for All, and she contributed the Float Quirk that Midoriya frequently makes use of. Aside from being a previous One for All user, though, Nana Shimura was a mentor figure for a young Toshinori Yagi, long before he came to be known as All Might.




          

Nana saw potential in this Quirkless boy, in much the same way that All Might would go on to see potential in Midoriya, and took on the task of training him herself. Additionally, Nana Shimura is the paternal grandmother of Tomura Shigaraki, whose birth name was actually Tenko Shimura.


 All Might Patterned His Armor After Nana Shimura 
          

In the image, which shows Midoriya, All Might in armor, and Nana Shimura herself, it&#39;s clear to see that All Might&#39;s battle suit is painted black with gold highlights. This is the same color scheme used in Nana&#39;s hero costume, showing that All Might decided to pay homage to his mentor in the construction of this armor just as much as he did his own pupils, whose powers the suit emulated. It&#39;s a fitting tribute, as Nana Shimura was killed by All for One many years ago, but just like All Might himself, her legacy continues to be a thorn in the villain&#39;s side. All Might clearly wanted All for One to be reminded of Nana and his final battle with her, perhaps as part of baiting him.




All Might&#39;s power suit has drawn inspiration from everyone who has meant something to the former #1 hero, both to give him the capacity to fight and to remind him of what he&#39;s fighting for. By wearing Nana&#39;s colors instead of his own, he&#39;s put on another act of defiance: All for One may have killed her, but she still stands against him, both as a vestige within One for All and as a memory close to All Might&#39;s heart. In a sense, it&#39;s almost a reminder of the futility of killing his foes. After all, killing Nana left followers behind who continue to work against him, and the same will be true for All Might, even if he succeeds at taking him down.



 All Might&#39;s Battle Armor Is A Powerful Statement Against All for One 
          

While the color of All Might&#39;s armor is ultimately a small detail, it&#39;s one that Kohei Horikoshi clearly put a lot of thought into. This armor represents All Might&#39;s final stand against All for One, in a battle that, despite the hero&#39;s boasts, he fully expected to die in. By wearing his mentor&#39;s colors, All Might proved to All for One that his past victims haven&#39;t been forgotten, and surely enough, the villain has a vision of Nana Shimura moments before All Might seemingly blows himself up to inflict him a fatal blow. All Might&#39;s battle may nearly be over, but his armor proved that My Hero Academia&#39;s heroes will stand against All for One to the very end.
