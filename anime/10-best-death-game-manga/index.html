<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Thanks to their high stakes and intense psychological warfare, death game manga provide some of the medium&rsquo;s most compelling stories of survival.</p>
<p>The best death game manga present some of the medium&rsquo;s most brutal and compelling stories, defined by high-stakes battles with profound psychological impact. As if in stark contrast to typical shōnen manga, where lives are rarely on the line and death isn&rsquo;t always the end, these titles understand the importance and weight of risking everything to survive.
As niche as the death game theme might seem, it still finds ways to present quite a bit of variety, both in terms of genres and ideas. Some death game manga involve battles defined by special supernatural abilities, while others are more grounded, featuring realistic characters fighting for survival with nothing but their wits. Sometimes, one&rsquo;s life doesn&rsquo;t even need to be on the line for the stakes and suspense to be high, proving that this theme still allows room for interpretation and innovation.</p>
<p>10  Deadman Wonderland (2007)
Original Series Written by Jinsei Kataoka &amp; Illustrated by Kazuma Kondou</p>
<p>When the mysterious Red Man massacres Ganta Igarashi&rsquo;s entire class, leaving him as the only survivor, Ganta ends up being framed for the slaughter and sent to Deadman Wonderland, a strange prison that also functions as a disturbing theme park, holding deadly games for tourists to watch. Determined to survive and find the real culprit to regain his freedom, Ganta soon encounters more inexplicable things about his situation, ranging from his newly awakened ability to manipulate blood to a supposed childhood friend named Shiro.
Deadman Wonderland provides one of the most iconic and entertaining death game experiences, complete with creative powers and an intriguing, fast-paced story that is sure to captivate the attention of readers from the very first chapter. The anime adaptation ended with an unresolved cliffhanger, leaving fans wondering what may happen next, but the manga provides a complete experience, including important additional side characters and a conclusion that manages to bring everything together.
Deadman Wonderland also received a fairly entertaining anime adaptation produced by Manglobe, which may serve as a good introduction to the story.</p>

<p>9  Battle in 5 Seconds (2015)
Original Series Written by Saizou Harawata &amp; Illustrated by Kashiwa Miyako</p>
<p>When a group of individuals suddenly find themselves kidnapped and thrown into an unfamiliar room, forced to act as test subjects for a research project that involves reality-defying abilities and deadly trials, most of them feel nothing but shock and fear. But Akira Shiroyanagi, a high school student who loves difficult puzzles, is more than willing to take on what he perceives to be a new challenging game, determined to survive and expose the truth behind the mysterious organization that brought them here.
Although the story is far from original, coming after many other similar established titles, Battle in 5 Seconds tells a straightforward yet well-executed death game story that thrives on the strength of its creative abilities and initiating characters. Although the protagonist is first shown to be relatively typical, thanks to his cold and calculated nature, his development adds a lot of unexpected depth. Moreover, the artwork is also exceptional, in no small part thanks to the artist&rsquo;s thoroughness and attention to detail.</p>
<p>8  Usogui (2006)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Toshio Sako</p>
<p>The world of gambling is as dangerous as it can be rewarding, which is why a powerful organization known as &ldquo;Kakerou&rdquo; exists, upholding the mission of ensuring the integrity of gambling and punishing anyone who would dare to cheat. Baku Madarame, also known as &ldquo;Usogui&rdquo; (The Lie Eater), is a genius gambler who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to risk his very life if needed. Aiming to take over Kakerou, Baku begins challenging various gamblers in psychological games that often prove deadly.
Usogui may not have as many death games as other titles, but it remains an absolutely outstanding and highly underrated manga that more fans of the medium ought to give a chance. The series progressively gets better, but it shows a lot of promise even early on, featuring a variety of creative gambles that involve intense psychological warfare. Moreover, all the characters are simply excellent, ranging from the memorable protagonist and incredibly compelling antagonist to the large cast of well-written and well-developed supporting characters.</p>
<p>7  Darwin&rsquo;s Game (2012)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by FLIPFLOPs</p>
<p>Kaname Sudou is an ordinary high school student whose life is about to take an unexpected, dangerous turn. As he is invited to try out the titular Darwin&rsquo;s Game, a mysterious mobile app, he decides to try it out, not knowing what to expect, but he soon finds himself in the middle of a survival game with no way to quit. Bewildered by the situation, Kaname is determined to survive, and eventually sets his mind on clearing the game.
Darwin&rsquo;s Game is a refreshingly tactical death game manga wherein battles are rarely decided by raw strength, but rather by those who can better read the situation and figure out a way to overcome their sigils&rsquo; drawbacks to prevail. The diversity of the abilities and the fighting styles adds a lot to the title&rsquo;s entertainment value, and the story, with its emphasis on mystery, is quite intriguing in its own right. Although the anime adaptation is known as one of the weirdest anime on Netflix, that only proves how unique this title is.
Darwin&rsquo;s Game received an enjoyable anime adaptation produced by Nexus.</p>
<p>6  Btooom! (2009)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Junya Inoue</p>
<p>Ryouta Sakamoto is an unemployed 22-year-old whose passion and skill for video games allowed him to become one of Btooom!&rsquo;s top players. As he suddenly wakes up to an unfamiliar sight on a tropical island, Ryouta soon realizes that he and other unwilling individuals are being forced to participate in a real-life version of Btooom!, where everyone is wielding real, rather than digital bombs, that can easily prove lethal. Although his familiarity with the game may prove advantageous, Ryouta is unwilling to kill anyone else, but his determination to survive might just overcome his fear.
Btooom! tells a genuinely brutal story of survival, which manages to stand out thanks to its realistic and well-developed characters, who successfully depict how different people may react in desperate situations. The story, while occasionally predictable, is also quite intriguing, always seeking to keep readers on the edge as parts of the underlying mystery are gradually revealed. Moreover, this title uniquely and infamously features two endings, one of which is the one intended by the author and the other one meant to please the fans.
Btooom! received an anime adaptation produced by Madhouse, which remains one of the medium&rsquo;s most popular takes on this theme.</p>
<p>5  Future Diary (2006)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Sakae Esuno</p>
<p>Yukiteru Amano is an ordinary, timid student, whose only distinctive feature is that he records everything in his cell phone diary. However, as the god of space and time, Deus Ex Machina, forces him, alongside 11 other contestants, into a game of survival whose winner is to become the god of the new world, Yukiteru&rsquo;s diary, much like those held by the others, gains a new special ability. With the power to predict the future and the aid of obsessive classmate Yuno Gasai, Yukiteru sets out to survive no matter what threats he may face.
As one of the first and easily the most popular illustrations of this theme, Future Diary is a highly influential death game title that has introduced many fans to the reality of cruel high-stakes games. The story and characters are not without their flaws, but they are chaotic and intriguing enough to prove incredibly memorable nonetheless. Yuno Gasai, in particular, is one of the medium&rsquo;s best female anti-heroes, proving the popularity of twisted characters.
Future Diary received a flawed yet iconic anime adaptation which can arguably be credited for the popularity of the death game theme in the medium.</p>

<p>4  Alice in Borderland (2010)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Haro Aso</p>
<p>Ryohei Arisu is a troubled high school student who struggles with the idea of growing up in a world where he sees no viable future for people like him, who excel in neither academics nor anything else. While waiting for the first train to depart after spending the night at a bar with his friends, Ryohei and his group find themselves mesmerized by a mysterious fireworks show, and then transported to a parallel, deserted world. Initially enjoying this newfound freedom, they soon learn that they have entered a place where their survival depends on the outcome of strange games.
Alice in Borderland explores a gruesome, compelling world, where survival is anything but guaranteed. It stands out compared to other similar titles not only thanks to its darker and more brutal tone, but also thanks to its story, which may seem familiar at first, but gradually becomes more complex and intriguing. The characters are yet another strong point of the title, as the story&rsquo;s cast is not only diverse but also well-developed. Finally, as proof of its popularity, Alice in Borderland also received a highly regarded live adaptation on Netflix.
Haro Aso, the author of Alice in Borderland, also wrote the story of Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, which recently received an outstanding anime adaptation produced by BUG FILMS.</p>

<p>3  Tomodachi Game (2013)
Original Series Written by Mikoto Yamaguchi &amp; Illustrated by Yuuki Satou</p>
<p>As Yuuichi Katagiri, a boy who struggles financially, and his close group of friends, all receive strange letters, they find themselves greeted by Manabu-kun, a character from a canceled children&rsquo;s show. Told that they were all gathered by one of the group members, burdened by a huge debt, they learn that they are to play a series of games, all of which can be won as long as they trust each other. However, as more secrets are revealed and betrayals occur, Yuuichi finds that it becomes more difficult to identify sincere friends.
Although it doesn&rsquo;t technically qualify as a death game, Tomodachi Game often proves far more psychologically impactful than typical death games, as the central group of friends experiences similarly traumatic experiences while playing creative and taxing games. Moreover, while the story starts simple enough, its constant twists and turns allow it to develop into something truly special and memorable. Innovating upon a familiar theme, the title modifies the stakes while providing a similarly suspenseful experience.</p>
<p>10 Best Death Game Anime
The Death Game genre is one of anime&rsquo;s most iconic, running the gamut from entertainingly edgy schlock to powerful critiques of humanity.</p>
<p>Tomodachi Game received a fantastic anime adaptation produced by Okuruto Noboru.</p>

<p>2  Liar Game (2005)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Shinobu Kaitani</p>
<p>Nao Kanzaki is an excessively honest girl, who could never even dream of deceiving someone. As such, while she may be the worst possible candidate to join the &ldquo;Liar Game&rdquo;, she still ends up unintentionally accepting an invitation after opening an unexpected package with one hundred million yen. Upon learning that a genius swindler and former psychology student, Shinichi Akiyama, has just been released from jail, Nao decides to enlist his help, wholeheartedly believing that he is her only hope of winning this game, where victory can only be achieved through deceit.
Liar Game is a uniquely engaging pseudo-death game, where the stakes are not people&rsquo;s lives, but rather their assets. Despite not featuring deaths in the traditional sense of the theme, causing others to fall into bankruptcy often proves just as traumatic. Moreover, the games featured therein are easily some of the medium&rsquo;s best, involving intense psychological battles full of compelling strategies and shocking twists. Even beyond the uniquely creative and captivating games themselves, this title also shines thanks to its well-defined and developed main characters.
Shinobu Kaitani, the author of Liar Game, also created One Outs, an underrated psychological title that received an anime adaption produced by Madhouse.</p>
<p>1  Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji (1996)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Nobuyuki Fukumoto</p>
<p>Kaiji Itou lives a directionless life, spending most of his days drinking and gambling with his friends. One day, a debt collector informs him that a loan he previously co-signed fell on his shoulders, reaching an incredibly high amount due to compounded interest. With no choice but to embark on a boat where debtors with similar circumstances have the chance to escape their situation, Kaiji sets out on a series of strange gambling games where the stakes are only going to get higher over time.
As somewhat of a predecessor to the death game theme, released even before the classic Battle Royale, Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji virtually introduced manga fans to the appeal of gripping, high-stakes mind games. It may be somewhat dated at this point, with the artwork in particular showing its age, but the games, that made it as popular as it is, remain incredibly exciting and engaging, featuring interesting rules and surprising strategies. All in all, this is not only one of the first but also one of the best death game manga out there.
Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji received a brilliant anime adaptation produced by Madhouse.</p>
