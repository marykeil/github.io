The MANGA Plus Creators program allows anyone to upload their manga on the MANGA Plus Creators site, and the series is available to read for free. There are also cash incentives for popular series, and the most popular series have the chance to be published by Shonen Jump themselves after being reviewed by the editors. Rafal Jaki and GAMU&#39;s manga was so popular and received praise from fans for its unique and compelling story, it ended up winning the competition.

No\Name is set in a world where a person&#39;s name is chosen at birth by the government and it corresponds to their special abilities and future careers. The story takes place in a Northern European-inspired setting where a mother and her son disappear. Two government workers from the agency that decides the names of people are sent to investigate, and they find that there is more than meets the eye to the case. Despite being only one chapter, the manga has a suspenseful plot that will leave you hungry for more. A major point of praise is the series&#39; creative power system that deviates from the stereotypical shōnen powers.





 

The series was so popular that it garnered more than 2 million readers, leading to its victory in the competition. The original premises and the compelling art made it feel like this was an official manga. Although there is only one chapter out at the moment, No\Name getting picked up by the publishing giant will ensure that Rafal and GAMU will get the resources and advice needed to put out more chapters consistently. Shonen Jump&#39;s publisher Shueisha has been making great strides in making manga more accessible outside of Japan, and publishing the work of a foreign author (and one who has global recognition due to his work on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners) in their magazine will set a great precedent and an example that the doors are open to anyone who has a great idea, Japanese or not.
