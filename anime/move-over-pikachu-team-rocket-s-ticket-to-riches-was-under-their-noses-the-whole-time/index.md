## Literature Review

Team Rocket spends a lot of time trying to steal Pikachu, but they already have a far rarer and more valuable Pokémon they&#39;re neglecting.




Pokémon&#39;s Team Rocket are always after riches and believe stealing Pikachu will be their ticket to wealth, but they constantly ignore the actual moneymaker that&#39;s already a member of their ranks: Meowth. Meowth&#39;s ability to talk makes it one of the rarest Pokémon seen in the series, and the applications of that ability are so numerous that it&#39;s a wonder they never tried to make it work.




In the Pokémon anime, very few Pokémon are able to speak, and most of those are of the more supernatural types, such as Psychic or Ghost. Meowth learned to walk upright and talk in order to impress a female Meowth named Meowzie, and apparently did so through sheer determination, with no secret experiments or special powers involved. While Meowzie wasn&#39;t won over by the gesture, this did leave Meowth as an incredibly rare sight. He fell in with Team Rocket, and Jessie and James in particular, because &#34;rocket&#34; was one of the first words that he learned.


 Meowth&#39;s Ability to Speak Could Solve Team Rocket&#39;s Problems 
          

It&#39;s extremely common for characters, particularly those of a scientific bent, to be stunned when Team Rocket shows up and Meowth speaks, to the point where they occasionally forget they&#39;re being threatened. Meowth&#39;s ability to speak is definitely the sort of thing that should be studied, to see if it&#39;s possible for other Pokémon to also learn how to speak. While Meowth probably wouldn&#39;t like being a research subject very much, that&#39;s far from the only job he&#39;s well equipped for. After all, Meowth can still understand Pokémon language too, and one of his most common roles in the series is to act as a translator for other Pokémon.




The ability to communicate with other Pokémon directly is extremely valuable, though, and that&#39;s definitely where the money lies. Meowth could work in a Pokémon Center with Nurse Joy, helping to identify the problems Pokémon are suffering from, or he could act as a mediator, helping to resolve problems between people and Pokémon. Most appealing to Team Rocket, however, is the idea that Meowth could easily become a movie star. As one of the only talking Pokémon in the world, Meowth&#39;s appearances in film would make him an instant star, giving him the respect and riches that they&#39;ve always longed for.

In some ways, it&#39;s actually a little sweet that Jessie and James don&#39;t try to exploit Meowth&#39;s ability to speak more often, instead treating him as just another member of the team. Still, Meowth&#39;s capacity for speech and translation is an incredibly valuable tool which could easily see the Team Rocket trio finding a way to go straight. Alas, the trio never quite seemed to figure that out, and instead are left trying to steal Pikachu forever, without realizing the potential sitting right next to them. Meowth may never learn Payday as a result of learning to speak, but a Pokémon that can speak is its own kind of pay day--if it&#39;s put to good use.
