 Demon Slayer Season 4 Is The Calm Before The Storm 

 

Season 4 is set to adapt the short but sweet Hashira Training arc. One of Demon Slayer&#39;s best arcs, this arc will see Tanjiro getting the training needed to finally become a Hashira after proving his worth in battle and defeating extremely powerful demons. The season will also expand on other mysterious Hashira such as the stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima, the serpent Hashira Obanai Iguri, and the wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa. Fan favorite Hashira from previous seasons, such as the Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui and the water Hashira, Giyu Tomioka, will also be making their long-awaited return.

What is interesting about this new season is the length of the source material that it is set to adapt. The Hashira Training arc is only 8 chapters, with the typical length for a season being 11â€“12 episodes that adapts 27 chapters. This has fans worried and confused, as the most that the season can be stretched to is 5 episodes. The only options are if the season includes source material not present in the manga or if the Infinity Castle arc will be adapted immediately after the Hashira Training.
