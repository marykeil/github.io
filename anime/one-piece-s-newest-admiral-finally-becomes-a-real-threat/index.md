# One Piece s Newest Admiral Finally Becomes A Real Threat


## SUMMARY 



  Green Bull is the most recent Marine Admiral to be revealed in One Piece, but his debut was not as intimidating as those of his fellow Admirals, who are among the most powerful men in the world.   The One Piece anime delves deeper into Admiral Ryokugyu&#39;s battles against Wano&#39;s protector, showcasing the fearsome powers of his Logia Devil Fruit.   Green Bull also better comes out as a truly cruel man, who represents the most twisted values of the World Government.

## Literature Review

One Piece has finally fixed the lackluster debut performance of Ryokugyu, the latest addition to the fearsome Marine Admirals.




Warning: Spoilers For One Piece Episode #1081Admiral Green Bull is a powerful enemy of the Straw Hats, whose debut in the manga was a little lackluster, but luckily the One Piece anime has fixed this, making Ryokugyu as monstrous as he should be. For over 20 years, the citizens of Wano were brutally subjugated, and their lands were ravaged by Kaido and Orochi&#39;s forces. After an incredibly hard-fought battle that saw the deaths of several One Piece characters, the samurai&#39;s homeland is once again theirs. However, the victory came with an increased bounty on Luffy&#39;s head, and the World Government&#39;s newest Admiral is poised to collect it.




In an effort to impress Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, Admiral Ryokugyu (aka Green Bull) flew past Wano&#39;s closed borders and quickly showed off more of his abilities than he did in chapter #1053 of One Piece. While Eiichiro Oda&#39;s manga did show the fearsome marine defeat Kaido&#39;s injured crewmates, King and Queen, the anime expanded the battle significantly, showing off Green Bull&#39;s dangerous Woods-Woods Logia Devil Fruit powers, and he was only getting started.


 

The One Piece manga contained most of Ryokugyu&#39;s fights within a few pages. However, episode #1081 of the anime showcased the true strength of the Admiral and his Mori Mori no Mi (WoodsWoods Fruit) against Wano&#39;s Red Scabbards, which makes him far more intimidating than in the manga.





 Green Bull Is A Scary Force Of Nature In One Piece 
          

The newest Admiral&#39;s Devil Fruit powers easily fit among the ranks of the Marine&#39;s most powerful Fruit users. Green Bull can spawn a seemingly endless amount of wood and tree limbs from his body, even growing back damaged limbs, and he can also drain nutrients from his victims. King and Queen were unfortunate enough to confront the Wano invader after his arrival. The injured villains provided an entertaining scuffle against Ryokugyu in One Piece episode #1080 that the manga skipped over. Still, in the end, they were both defeated and drained of their remaining energy. It was only the beginning of the anime&#39;s brutal introduction to the Admiral thirsty for Luffy&#39;s bounty. Still, he would need to get through Wano&#39;s new protectors before reaching the Straw Hat Captain.





 

Episode #1081 saw each Red Scabbard sensing the danger from Admiral Ryokugyu as he approached the Flower Capital and quickly gathered to confront the imposing enemy. Raizo, Denjiro, and even Yamato are given incredibly well-animated action scenes against Green Bull and his Woods-Woods powers. One Piece&#39;s animators went above and beyond to adapt the fearsome wood powers that can elongate, pierce enemies, and transform the Admiral into a huge Kaiju tree man. It was then that Momonosuke joined the battle to defend his home, but even his giant pink dragon form failed to intimidate the invader by the time the episode&#39;s outro played.

What is most scary about Green Bull&#39;s presentation in the anime is not his monstrous body or incredible powers. The Admiral takes the time to tell the protectors of Wano that, as a country not affiliated to the World Government, they essentially have no rights, and should all be sacrificed for the good of the &#34;real&#34; citizens. It is a cruel, ruthless, and yet accurate description of the ideology that supports the world created by the Celestial Dragons, and hearing it from Green Bull makes the admiral a much more despicable and fearsome villain. The One Piece anime has done an excellent job of heightening this pivotal moment by making Ryokugyu&#39;s powers seem more dangerous and monstrous in ways that the manga could not.
