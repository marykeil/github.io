## Literature Review

Protocol: Rain is different from the majority of MMORPG anime because of the unique game it features, which is also not the main focus of the story.




Protocol: Rain on Crunchyroll might be another gaming anime, but it stands out from the inundation of VR MMORPG series out there for a number of reasons, and anime-goers looking for something fresh should put it on their watchlist. First, the series&#39; game is a regular first-person shooter similar to Call of Duty that features old-school 64-bit graphics as opposed to immersive VR worlds. Second, the focus is more on the unique and complex relationships of the players than the actual game play, partly for that reason.




The story, of course, revolves around the fictional online game Xaxerion. The main characters - including protagonist Shun, his friend in real life Nozomi, and online companion Explosion-kun, initially bonded over the game as kids. Now, they must compete in a cutthroat e-sports competition on the team Fox One run by Nozomi&#39;s father to save his failing game café.

          

However, the intricate relationships of various characters stand out even though the café&#39;s future is contingent on them winning the e-sports competition. Protocol: Rain, an original anime by Team Kitsune and animator Quad, is also known as Our Rainy Protocol.

Explosion-kun&#39;s true identity is a major plot point in the series. She&#39;s not only a famous actress named Yu, but she&#39;s beloved by Shun&#39;s younger sister, who became paralyzed in a car accident that killed their father. Upon learning about the e-sports competition, Yu decides to join but in disguise. While all this is going on, Shun and his friends are competing in the esports tournament. Incredibly, the actual gameplay doesn&#39;t take up much time in each episode. The first round transpires in episode #4, and the series only follows the match between Shun&#39;s team Fox One and Sleeping Owl. By episode #5, the two teams have a rematch in the final round, and the esports tournament ends in minutes.

                  Crunchyroll&#39;s Newest Hit Exposes Anime&#39;s Flawed Relationship to Videogames   As fun as Shangri La Frontier is, its written game mechanics once more are used to inflate the protagonist&#39;s powers, rather than build a world.   

Besides barely covering the actual gameplay, the purposeful low-end graphics of Xaxerion naturally limit the amount that Protocol: Rain can actually focus on it. While other series like Shangri-La Frontier use advanced immersive VR MMORPG as the basis for their story, Protocol: Rain takes the opposite route. The avatars aren&#39;t lifelike, so honing on each one just involves zooming in on a 64-bit character who has no recognizable face as the player&#39;s voice randomly appears in the background. The lack of versatile gameplay also makes each round essentially the same, so spending too much time in the game wouldn&#39;t provide a lot for viewers.

All these factors naturally push the gameplay into the background despite the plot line revolving around and being driven by the actual game. Instead, the unique dynamics of the characters when they&#39;re AFK unprecedentedly take the spotlight. Hardcore fans of immersive MMORPGs like Sword Art Online might be turned away by the unexpected lack of actual gameplay, but those who are looking for something fresh will naturally gravitate towards the series. Most anime-goers hunger for complex character development and relationships anyway, so Crunchyroll&#39;s Protocol: Rain naturally meets this need and more.
