## Literature Review

Berserk of Gluttony on Crunchyroll gives a twisted spin to the beloved &#34;My worthless skill isn&#39;t actually that useless&#34; trope in many anime. 





In this case, the hero Fate Graphite&#39;s pathetic skill is Gluttony, and he&#39;s ridiculed for the misconception that it can&#39;t ever be useful. As a result, he&#39;s referred to as one of the have-nots - the name for those who have not been blessed with a gifted skill. However, Fate isn&#39;t kicked out of a hero party like many protagonists are in these types of stories, such as Crunchyroll&#39;s Beast Tamer. Fate&#39;s skill is just outright too lame to get into one.




          

That said, after accidentally learning of Gluttony&#39;s true potential, Fate does become extremely overpowered like most heroes in his situation. He easily outmatches every monster and human to the point where there is little to no conflict - another ubiquitous feature of this type of series.


 Berserk of Gluttony&#39;s Hero Needs to Keep His Power Secret 
          

It&#39;s here where the best series in this subgenre usually differentiate themselves. As revealed in Berserk of Gluttony episode two, Fate is forced to get stronger by consuming skills if he wants to avoid starving to death or attacking everyone around him. However, it&#39;s much more complicated than that because he can&#39;t just level up at any time. In episode one, a kind Holy Knight named Roxy saves Fate from his dead-end job by inviting him to serve her family. In addition to wanting to repay Roxy for her kindness, Fate had already demonstrated that he doesn&#39;t want to make her life more complicated, so he naturally endeavors to keep his true ability a secret, forcing him to sneak out at night to slaughter monsters.




This setup naturally provides a continuous yet unique supply of conflict. Fans of this particular genre generally gravitate towards these types of series to see the hero always succeed and gain an insane amount of power in a way that constantly surprises them since their suddenly useful ability is completely new to them. Meanwhile, some external force or the hero&#39;s own unique preferences prevent them from revealing their true power, preventing the hero from gaining the recognition they deserve. And yet, Berserk of Gluttony&#39;s premise flips the whole situation. Fate actually doesn&#39;t want Roxy to find out the truth as that would jeopardize the wonderful life he now has with her.



 Berserk of Gluttony Also Mimics Another Anime Fad 
          

Similar to giving its own take on the &#34;useless skill&#34; trope, Berserk of Gluttony explores the &#34;I was given a cheat&#34; story. Of course, these types of anime are usually Isekai and involve the hero getting reincarnated with a skill that defies all logic. Here, Gluttony essentially cheats its world&#39;s rules by allowing Fate to steal the skills of those he kills. As viewers learn early on, even the most gifted people only receive one blessed skill. No one has more than one. However, the way Gluttony functions basically hacks this rule or allows Fate to cheat. Although Berserk of Gluttony is pandering to not one but two popular tropes, the series is doing an exceptional job of deconstructing the norm and giving fans something new and, best of all, dark.




Berserk of Gluttony is streaming on Crunchyroll now!
