## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s length seems daunting for new fans, but it is one of its best qualities, and one character proves it.




One Piece is known as one of the best manga and anime franchises ever, but its length seems daunting and turns many interested viewers away. This is a valid reason, as many people simply cannot commit to twenty-five years of story, no matter how good it is, but the length of One Piece is also one of its best qualities, and one minor character proves it.




One Piece&#39;s length is a big reason why people are turned off by the franchise. Both the anime and the manga have been running for more than 20 years, and even if it&#39;s been announced that the series is nearing its end, that&#39;s still nowhere in sight. In reality, One Piece&#39;s 1000&#43; episodes and chapters are one of its strongest points, further proving why the series is one of the best.

          

One Piece is known for its vast, diverse, and sometimes wacky-looking cast of characters. The length of the story means that there is more than enough time to give each character the spotlight and expand on their stories and ambitions. While this is obvious for the main characters, such as Luffy and the Straw Hats, even a minor and apparently inconsequential character like Karoo, Vivi&#39;s duck, is a great example of this.




                  One Piece Stole Gear Five From Another Famous Manga   Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s comedic hero and his reality-bending Cursed Technique may just give One Piece&#39;s Gear Five and Luffy a run for their money.   


 Karoo&#39;s Unexpected Development Proves One Piece&#39;s Best Quality 
One Piece chapter #182 and episode #112 show that even a duck can have character development.

 

Vivi, the princess of Alabasta, has a beloved pet duck named Karoo. This feathered companion has been by her side since birth, providing moments of comic relief and occasional assistance. However, it wasn&#39;t until Karoo&#39;s involvement in the Alabasta Arc that his true worth became apparent. Vivi entrusted him with a vital mission; to deliver a letter detailing the cause of the rebellion to her father, King Cobra, in the city of Alubarna. To everyone&#39;s surprise, Karoo completed the mission with ease, delivering the letter quickly and efficiently. Fans were amazed by Karoo&#39;s bravery and loyalty, but that wasn&#39;t the last time when he captivated everyone&#39;s heart.




Vivi and the straw hats rushed to Alubarna to stop the million-strong rebel army by talking to Koza, their leader, and Vivi&#39;s childhood friend. Crocodile and his Baroque Works - the true masterminds behind Alabasta&#39;s rebellion - managed to prevent this, and the rebels did not stop. Vivi was in the way of the approaching army, many of whom were on camels and horses. Just when it seemed like she would be trampled on and killed, Karoo shielded her. What makes this action even more heroic is how Karoo saves Vivi from Mr. 2, who disguised himself as Usopp, despite being severely injured.

          

Few fans expected Vivi&#39;s comic-relief pet sidekick to play such an important role in the story, but this showcases one of the unique aspects of One Piece. Any other series would simply lack the time to show Karoo acting as a hero and saving the day. However, Eichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, has crafted this long-running series by fleshing out the personalities, backstories, and ambitions of each character, making it incredibly memorable. The series is renowned not just for its main cast but also for its well-designed side characters, which showcase that the daunting length of One Piece gives the series enough time to develop each character, giving them their unique traits and motivations, even when they&#39;re just a big duck.
