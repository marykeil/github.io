# Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War Finally Redeems One Captain With a Major Power-Up


## SUMMARY 



  Despite being defeated by their Quincy adversaries and turned into zombies, the fallen Soul Reaper Captains prove to be more powerful and fierce in battle than when they were alive.   Hitsugaya, Kensei, Rose, and Rangiku demonstrate their exceptional combat skills even in their zombified state, with Hitsugaya even using his Zanpakuto and creative ice spike attacks.   Although it may be possible for these Soul Reapers to be restored to their proper life, the means to do so remains unknown, leaving them no choice but to continue fighting as zombies for now.

## Literature Review

Dying is never really the end in Bleach, and a handful of Soul Reaper Captains have gone on to prove it in the most absurd way possible.




Warning: Spoilers for Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, Episode #23Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has seen a number of Soul Reaper Captains defeated by their Quincy Sternritter adversaries, but some of these fallen captains seem to be better off now than they were before.




Kensei and Rose are two of the former Visored, who returned to being captains in the Soul Society after the Arrancar arc concluded. They were shown to be fighting Mask de Masculine earlier in Thousand-Year Blood War, but both captains were ultimately defeated by the wrestler-themed Quincy. Something similar happened with Toshiro Hitsugaya, who was defeated by Bazz-B in a particularly brutal manner and left to die. However, none of these Soul Reaper Captains actually got the chance to die, because the Sternritter Giselle came along and turned them into her zombies.


 Bleach&#39;s Soul Reaper Captains Fight Better As Zombies 
          

The zombified Hitsugaya immediately proved himself a tremendous threat, and actually would have succeeded at killing Mayuri Kurotsuchi had it not been for the latter&#39;s use of a special drug that caused him to enter a time loop. Despite being a zombie, Hitsugaya was able to use his Zanpakuto with ease, and even managed some creative attacks, such as using his power to create ice spikes on his knees before going in for the attack with them. Kensei and Rose (and Rangiku) were also revealed to have been turned into zombies, but Mayuri was able to take control of them away from Giselle and give it to himself.




When Mayuri deploys the zombie Kensei and Rose against the Sternritter PePe, the two are positively vicious, with Kensei whipping out his Bankai to wail on the Quincy. This was actually a change made in the anime, as in the manga Kensei doesn&#39;t use his Bankai to defeat PePe, but rather his bare fists. While Byakuya is rather disgusted at the state they&#39;re in, there&#39;s no arguing it: their performance in battle is just plain better as zombies than it was when they were alive. If they&#39;re capable of using their Zanpakuto, and even Bankai, in this state, it may well be better to do as Mayuri suggested and leave them as zombies until the defense of the Soul Society has come to an end.

Kensei, Rose, Rangiku and Hitsugaya were all explicitly turned into zombies prior to their deaths, as with Giselle&#39;s power, this makes them better zombies. That does mean that it should be possible for these Soul Reapers to be restored to proper life, although the question of how exactly to do that remains up in the air. It may take time and research from Mayuri to figure out how to do so, so these four may have no choice but to remain as zombies for the time being. It&#39;s a tad ironic that being turned into zombies actually turned these Bleach warriors into better fighters, but in the situation that the Soul Society is in, any power-up is welcome.
