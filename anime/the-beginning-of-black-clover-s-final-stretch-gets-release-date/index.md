# The Beginning of Black Clover s Final Stretch Gets Release Date


## SUMMARY 



  Black Clover&#39;s final chapter in Shonen Jump was released in August, and the next chapter will debut in Jump GIGA 2023&#39;s winter issue in December.   Going forward, Black Clover will be released less frequently, with only four chapters per year.

## Literature Review

Fans now know the release date of Jump GIGA&#39;s winter issue, which is the publication Black Clover&#39;s story will continue after moving from Shonen Jump.




The release date of Black Clover&#39;s debut chapter on Jump GIGA was recently announced via the Shonen Jump News account on X, formerly known as Twitter. Before its departure, Black Clover&#39;s final installment via long-time publication Shonen Jump was chapter #368 on August 20.




Shonen Jump News announced that chapter #369 would appear in Jump GIGA 2023&#39;s winter issue in December 2023. The series will also get the cover and lead color page in the same issue.


 

Besides the ongoing four-month wait since Black Clover&#39;s last chapter in Shonen Jump, the release dates of Black Clover&#39;s installments will be less frequent going forward. When still running in Shonen Jump, Black Clover endured a weekly regime, with chapters featuring the customary 19-or-less-page format. Since Jump GIGA is a quarterly publication, Black Clover will only come out four times per year, but with an estimated 45-or-so-page chapters.


 Black Clover&#39;s Manga Returns for its Last Stretch in December 2023 
          




Black Clover is currently in its last arc with the final battle already underway. Lucius, the fourth Zogratis sibling whose brothers and sisters once made up the Dark Triad, is attempting to create a world where everyone&#39;s magical abilities are incredible but equal by transforming everyone into Paladins. A few mages, both dead and alive, have become Paladin-ized, including Noelle&#39;s deceased mother Acier and even Asta&#39;s beloved Sister Lily who has just been restored to her normal self. Meanwhile, Asta has finally completed his training in Yami&#39;s home country and just transferred his anti-magical abilities to the Black Bulls since anti-magic is Lucius&#39; only weakness. In fact, Asta is the only mage who can&#39;t live in Lucius&#39; new world since he doesn&#39;t possess magic.

Although well into Black Clover&#39;s final arc, many mysteries still remain with even more loose ends left untied. It&#39;s still unknown how Asta got teleported to Yami&#39;s home country. The magic that Paladin Sister Lily cast on Asta clearly has something to do with it, but it&#39;s already been greatly implied that Sister Lily didn&#39;t mean for that to happen. Moreover, the mysterious devil Adramelech undoubtedly has more of a role to play since he betrayed the king of devils Lucifero who, while incapacitated, is still very much alive and could seek vengeance on him. Moreover, it was discovered that the Wizard King Julius and Lucius are two separate souls who share the same body, and, right now, Lucius has full control. So, fans can expect Julius to return in some shape or form. There&#39;s also the question of whether Julius willfully participated in Lucius&#39; plan since Lucius once suggested that Julius played a crucial role in his master plan to create a perfect world.






 Black Clover&#39;s Move to Quarterly is Better For its Creator 
          

With these and many more mysteries still left unanswered, readers have reason to hope that Black Clover chapter #369 in Jump GIGA&#39;s winter issue won&#39;t be the series&#39; final installment. They can also rest assured that the move from Shonen Jump to Jump GIGA was the right choice for mangaka Yuki Tabata even though they must endure longer breaks between each installment. Leading up to the official announcement, Yuki had taken numerous weeks off due to his wife&#39;s poor health, and he also said in an official statement that he was struggling to keep up with Shonen Jump&#39;s rigorous weekly schedule and noted that the move would be better for his health. So, as Black Clover continues after Jump GIGA&#39;s winter issue this December, fans will have the knowledge that they are enjoying their favorite series, but not at the expense of Yuki Tabata&#39;s health and happiness.




Black Clover chapters #1-368 are available on Viz.com. Black Clover chapter #369 will be available via Jump GIGA.
