## Literature Review

The Dragon Ball Super manga finally gives Goten and Trunks their time to shine and begins to set itself apart from the Super Hero movie.






The portrayal of Goten and Trunks has been a particular sore spot for the fanbase. In the Super Hero movie, Goten and Trunks come across as too goofy to take seriously and are present as inept and useless and don&#39;t really contribute to the heroes&#39; efforts in any meaningful way. Luckily, Chapter #97 of Dragon Ball Super has done a lot to address both of these fan criticisms, giving Goten and Trunks their time to shine and beginning to set itself apart from the Super Hero film. In addition to Cell Max himself being a more impressive enemy and more capable fighter in the manga adaptation of the story arc, Goten and Trunks are given more prominence in the fight scene and portrayed as both more serious characters and more capable fighters.

Fighting in their Saiyaman X-1 and X-2 costumes, Goten and Trunks are given more moments to shine in the fight with Cell Max. Most notably, Goten and Trunks launch a combined attack against Cell Max with the androids Gamma 1 and Gamma 2 after they join forces with the heroes. Although this involves some goofy superhero posing, that&#39;s an established aspect of the Saiyaman persona, so it is at least in character for Goten and Trunks. Also, it pays off in an attack that visibly hurts Cell Max and at least momentarily slows him down.

Goten and Trunks&#39; contribution to the manga version of the fight scene is finally addressing the criticisms that have lingered about the Super Hero storyline. The current manga arc has been a fairly straightforward adaptation of the Super Hero film and has been criticized by Dragon Ball fans for not doing enough to set itself apart. Chapter #97 shows some a notable deviation from the way the fight scene is presented in the Super Hero movie and one that gives the portrayal of Goten and Trunks some much-needed redemption. It also helps to address criticisms that the Super Hero manga arc was just a rehash of what the fans have already seen in the Super Hero movie.

The expanded role of Goten and Trunks has been welcomed by the fanbase. In giving Goten and Trunks their moment to shine, the characters are portrayed as more serious fighters and the storyline itself is finally allowed to do something new. Even if they are coming a bit late, as the Super Hero arc is about to conclude, these changes to storyline and especially the portrayal of Goten and Trunks are helping to address some long-standing criticisms of Dragon Ball Super.
