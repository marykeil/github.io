## Literature Review

Shonen Jump manga are able to explore a wide variety of topics, but despite this freedom there is one subject the magazine can&#39;t touch.





In the recent manga Do Retry by Jun Kirarazaka, the main character Aozora&#39;s father has gone missing after his time serving in the Japanese army during World War 2. While he is initially presumed dead, one of his former squad mates is eventually introduced and reveals that he is alive and hiding somewhere in Japan. He also reveals that during the war Aozora&#39;s father killed his entire squad, which doesn&#39;t seem to fit with his normally righteous persona. This seems to imply that Aozora&#39;s dad realized that what his squad was doing was unjust and thus turned on them. Instead, it is disappointingly revealed that his squad had turned on him for pushing them too hard, so he was forced to kill them.





 Shonen Jump&#39;s Do Retry Fails to Examine the Horrors of World War 2 
          

This is an unfortunate pivot from what would have been a great exploration of trying to maintain honor during the horrors of war. Japan&#39;s World War 2 record is tarnished by the war crimes committed by the Japanese Imperial Army, making this topic still controversial to talk about in modern Japanese society. It unfortunately makes sense why Do Retry would be unable to explore that topic in any meaningful way. However, even ignoring the most controversial aspects of the Japanese experience in World War 2, the series could have still just examined the dehumanizing and morally abhorrent aspects of modern war in general. It seemed the series was set up for this sort of exploration, but this was changed at some point.

Of course, this may just be giving Kirarazaka too much credit. The author could have potentially always intended for this lackluster and somewhat nonsensical revelation to be the case, and the necessarily rushed pace at the end of the series just forced it to be underdeveloped. In addition, the series&#39; sudden cancelation could have been a result of its lack of popularity and have nothing to do with the topic. While this Shonen Jump series may have started with a heartbreaking chapter showing the tragic living conditions of postwar Japan, it quickly moved away from its down-to-earth premise in favor of outlandish boxing fights and powers, which may have caused fans to lose interest.






 Do Retry&#39;s Cancelation Leaves Shonen Jump&#39;s Stance Ambiguous 
          

This could be a reasonable explanation for Do Retry&#39;s cancellation, but the series&#39; end corresponding with the introduction of the mystery of Aozora&#39;s father makes it seem likely it is related to the manga broaching a taboo topic. However, with Shonen Jump culling many other new series as well, fans may never know the real reason for the series&#39; cancelation. Still, the short-lived Do Retry still serves as a reminder that Shonen Jump manga either can&#39;t or won&#39;t explore Japan&#39;s actions during World War 2, which is a shame given how interesting the result could be.
