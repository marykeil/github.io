## Literature Review

Dragon Ball is a series well known for its ridiculously powerful attacks, from planet to universe busters, here are its ten strongest attacks ever.




Dragon Ball is a franchise that has captivated audiences for decades with its thrilling action, intense battles, and epic displays of powerful attacks. One of the most beloved aspects of the series is undoubtedly the impressive array of attacks that the characters have at their disposal.
In order to give some shine to the series&#39; more unique techniques, this list will also avoid placing extremely similar or generically powerful techniques, so that it isn&#39;t entirely filled with energy beams that function almost identically. With that in mind, the most powerful attacks in Dragon Ball history showcase some of the most impressive and devastating techniques in the entire series:









 








 10  Devilmite Beam - Negative Emotions Used Against You 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball, &#34;The Mysterious Fifth Man&#34;
        

&#34;It is a force of unimaginable evil, that has destroyed more lives than any war or pestilence combined.&#34; This is how Master Roshi described the power of the Devilmite Beam back in early Dragon Ball. Now, the actual mechanic behind how this ability is explained to work could make it the deadliest attack in Dragon Ball history but there is one caveat. The Devilmite Beam is said to work by latching onto any shred of negativity, anger, or dark thoughts inside an opponent and amplifying them to such an extent that anyone hit by the Devilmite Beam will literally explode from the inside out. By this logic, Devilman should be called in whenever the Earth faces a serious threat.
Later on in Dragon Ball, however, it becomes apparent that even techniques that bypass an opponent&#39;s inherent defenses can be rendered null if said opponent simply has more ki than the attacker. If this were to be the case for the Devilmite Beam, then the technique would only be able to take out those around the same strength as Devilman, but if not, then Devilman would simply one-shot the series&#39; most potent villains immediately.





 9  Destructo Disc / Kienzan - A Spinning Disc of Death 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Nimbus Speed&#34;


 







Krillin&#39;s hyper-powerful Destructo Disc is easily Krillin&#39;s most iconic attack for good reason. Krillin has used this technique in numerous battles, and it has proven to be a formidable weapon time and time again. What makes the Destructo Disc particularly impressive is its versatility. Krillin can control the disk&#39;s trajectory and manipulate its shape, making it an adaptable technique that can catch even the most skilled fighters off-guard. While it may not be the flashiest or most destructive attack in Dragon Ball, Krillin&#39;s Destructo Disc has certainly earned its place among the most powerful attacks in the series.





 8  Special Beam Cannon - A Beam Capable of Penetrating Any Defense 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Piccolo&#39;s Plan&#34;


 







Piccolo&#39;s Special Beam Cannon is without a doubt one of the deadliest attacks in all of Dragon Ball. This move is both devastatingly powerful and difficult to execute, making the technique&#39;s usage actually quite rare. Piccolo developed this move during the timeskip between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z with the intention of killing Goku, and it was actually completely successful in that regard. The Special Beam Cannon&#39;s ability to burrow through an opponent&#39;s defenses makes it a dangerous technique to face, and its fatal injury guarantees that anyone hit by it won&#39;t be getting back up. Despite its slow charge time, the sheer power of the Special Beam Cannon is enough to make it one of the most feared techniques in the Dragon Ball universe.





 7  Human Extinction Attack - One Attack, Massive Slaughter 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Empty Planet&#34;
        

With a name like the &#39;Human Extinction Attack&#39; there is no way this move could be ignored. This attack, used by both Super Buu and Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Goku Black, is... disturbing, to say the least. What makes the Human Extinction Attack deadlier than Kid Buu&#39;s Planet Burst is the move&#39;s sheer quantity of blasts. In just moments, Super Buu extinguished millions, if not billions of people across the globe thanks to the Human Extinction Attack. What&#39;s more, he didn&#39;t just vaporize people with this attack, they were all punctured through the heart with near-surgical precision. The fact that any character in Dragon Ball has access to a move like this, potentially billions of energy beams able to be manipulated with insane amounts of precision, is ridiculous.





 6  Dragon Fist - Goku&#39;s Last Resort 
Debut Movie: Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon
        

Veering away from the complexity of manipulating a billion balls of energy with the mind is Goku&#39;s infamous Dragon Fist. This straightforward move is reminiscent of the attack Goku used to defeat King Piccolo. When executed properly, Goku&#39;s ki briefly transforms into a dragon and delivers a devastating punch that obliterates even the most formidable enemies. Whenever the Dragon Fist appears, it is always Goku&#39;s last resort, indicating this technique holds a tremendous amount of power behind it. It has been able to shatter the defenses of opponents leagues more powerful than Goku, such as Omega Shenron and Super 17. While it is not one of Goku&#39;s more commonly used techniques, the Dragon Fist has left a lasting impact on Dragon Ball fans around the world, cementing its place as one of the most powerful attacks in the series.





 5  Sickle of Sorrow - Divine Power Turned Deadly 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;Worship Me! Give Praise Unto Me! The Explosive Birth of a Merged Zamasu!&#34;
        

Goku Black&#39;s Sickle of Sorrow is a technique that is as terrifying as it is powerful. This move is a physical manifestation of the god-like power that Goku Black possesses, and it can open rifts between dimensions. The Sickle of Sorrow is a technique that is used to deliver a swift and devastating strike to opponents, with the power to inflict absurd amounts of damage. The technique itself is simple yet incredibly effective, as it requires only a swing of Goku Black&#39;s arm to unleash a wave of energy that can cut through almost anything in its path. This move is a testament to the raw power of Goku Black, and it has rightfully earned its place among the most powerful attacks in Dragon Ball history.





 4  Tri-Beam - Power at Great Risk 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball, &#34;The Spirit Cannon&#34;
        

Tien Shinhan&#39;s Tri-Beam is a technique that is truly in a league of its own. While Tien may not be considered one of Dragon Ball&#39;s top fighters, this move is beyond deadly. Unlike other energy-based attacks, such as the Kamehameha, the Tri-Beam draws upon the user&#39;s life force to sustain it. This unique mechanic gives the Tri-Beam a level of raw power that is unmatched by most other techniques, though it also comes with the drawback that overuse of the move can kill the user. Despite this risk, Tien was able to hold back Semi-Perfect Cell using the Tri-Beam alone, a testament to just how deadly this technique can be. It&#39;s no wonder that the Tri-Beam is considered one of the most powerful attacks in Dragon Ball history, and should be kept out of the hands of anyone other than the most skilled and disciplined fighters.





 3  Spirit Bomb - Goku&#39;s Ultimate Technique 
Debut Episode: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Counting Down&#34;


 







Goku&#39;s Spirit Bomb is one of the most iconic and powerful attacks in Dragon Ball history. This technique draws upon the energy of living beings, allowing Goku to amass an incredible amount of power. The Spirit Bomb is a technique that is reserved for only the most dire of situations, as it requires a significant amount of time and energy to gather the necessary power. But when executed properly, the Spirit Bomb is a force to be reckoned with, capable of contending against opponents thousands of times more powerful than Goku himself. The technique&#39;s sheer scale and destructive power are truly awe-inspiring, and its appearance in the series has left a lasting impression on Dragon Ball fans around the world.





 2  Stardust Breaker - The Ultimate Fusion Attack 
Debut Movie: Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn
        

Gogeta&#39;s Stardust Breaker is an incredibly powerful attack that combines the immense strength and skill of both Goku and Vegeta. One popular fan theory suggests that the Stardust Breaker is actually a fusion of two of the series&#39; most iconic attacks: Goku&#39;s Spirit Bomb and Vegeta&#39;s Big Bang Attack. This theory is supported by Gogeta&#39;s statement that the attack uses his opponent&#39;s own negative energy against them, a feature that is also present in the Spirit Bomb. The Stardust Breaker&#39;s ability to target an opponent&#39;s malicious intent could be attributed to the Spirit Bomb&#39;s targeting of negativity in one&#39;s heart. Additionally, the theory also explains why the technique was able to completely disintegrate Janemba, while Broly was able to survive it. As a kind-hearted warrior, Broly may not have possessed the same negative energy that the attack was designed to target.





 1  Hakai - The God of Destruction&#39;s Power 
Debut Movie: Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods
        

Beerus&#39; Hakai is without a doubt Dragon Ball&#39;s most fearsome and powerful technique. Hakai can completely erase an individual from existence across different timelines. However, there is some confusion regarding the true extent of its power, as its usage in the Goku Black arc doesn&#39;t quite match up with Beerus&#39; claims. In the manga, both Goku and Vegeta demonstrate some degree of proficiency with Hakai. Goku was able to use it on Zamasu, obliterating half of his face, while Vegeta was shown practicing the technique on inanimate objects on Beerus&#39; homeworld.
As the series becomes more martial arts-oriented once again with the introduction of Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego, it will be interesting to see whether a technique as overpowered as this still has a place in either of the Saiyan protagonists&#39; arsenals. Still, in Beerus&#39; hands, Hakai has the potential to be Dragon Ball&#39;s strongest attack ever.
There are undoubtedly hundreds if not thousands more techniques in Dragon Ball, each of them powerful and unique in their own way. Ultimately, whether it&#39;s the classic techniques of the original Dragon Ballor the new techniques of Dragon Ball Super, the series continues to deliver some of the most jaw-dropping and unforgettable attacks in all of anime history.
