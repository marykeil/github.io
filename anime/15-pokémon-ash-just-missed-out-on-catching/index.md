## Literature Review

Ash Ketchum has encountered many impressive Pokémon over the years, but there are quite a few he missed out on catching.





Among the many generational series, Ash had developed some pretty powerful and mighty teams of fighters as well as companions. However, some fans believe that Ash missed out on catching some of the best Pokémon he has ever encountered and therefore missed out on improving his various teams.









 








 15  Slowking 
        

In Pokémon Journeys, Ash and Goh discovered a strange island full of Slowpoke, Slowbro, and Slowking in &#34;Slowking&#39;s Crowning!&#34;. The Slowking in particular ended up having a rather wild experience, as its Shellder crown became dislodged and landed on Ash&#39;s (and then Goh&#39;s) heads, altering their personalities in bizarre ways. Often times, a joke like that is a set-up for a running gag after a Pokémon has been caught, but not this time. Once Ash and Goh regain their senses, they end up leaving the island without either of them catching anything. Slowking is a bulky Psychic-type/Water-type with a good variety of moves at its disposal, so it could&#39;ve made a valuable ally had he caught it.





 14  Haunter 
        

Ash encountered Haunter in &#34;Tower of Terror,&#34; where this Haunter actually killed Ash temporarily by accident, causing him to have an out-of-body experience. Ash and Haunter bonded during this experience as they played pranks on Misty and Brock, and eventually it came with him to battle Sabrina when he returned to his body. However, Haunter ended up staying with Sabrina, rather than being captured by Ash. It&#39;s a shame, as this Haunter would&#39;ve been a very powerful addition to his team. Fortunately, Ash did eventually catch a Gengar in Pokémon Journeys, which proved its value repeatedly, but it&#39;s not the original Haunter he met.





 13  Cubone 
        

Fans of the franchise know that Cubone would be a great asset to Ash&#39;s team for its epic backstory alone. Knowing that Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother to honor her and keep her close, it&#39;s no question that Cubone&#39;s courage would make it a perfect addition to Ash&#39;s Pokémon collection. Cubone is the perfect example of how sadness and tragedy can build character and come out stronger in the end. Its tears can protect itself from recoil damage, not to mention its incredible ground attacks would make great assets, including Iron Head, Bonemerang, and Thunder Punch.





 12  Eevee 
        

Known as one of the best starter Pokémon Eevee would have been a great one for Ash to start out with. Not to mention the Kanto Pokémon is a classic for a reason, given its many impressive evolution forms. It&#39;s also worth noting that Ash favors one of the forms over the others, Espeon, which would make it all the more special if he had caught one to later evolve. Having an Espeon, or any Eevee form for that matter, would have made Ash even more of a major threat in the gym battles.





 11  Wimpod 
        

Wimpod appeared in the episode &#34;Partner Promises!&#34; While many of its comrades attempted to steal from Ash, this Wimpod was trapped at the bottom of a crevice, and needed Ash and Pikachu&#39;s help to rescue it. Wimpod grew close with Ash during the experience, but ultimately chose to return to its own kind, although it said goodbye very reluctantly. Wimpod itself is not very strong, as the name suggests, but its evolution Golisopod is an incredibly powerful Bug-type/Water-type Pokémon with a rather unique ability, Emergency Exit, that would&#39;ve been interesting to see Ash make use of.





 10  Machop 
        

Fans believe it&#39;s long overdue for Ash to own a heavy-duty Fighting-type such as Machop. Not only can it evolve into Machoke, but when traded, it can become Machamp one of the most powerful Pokémon evolutions by trading. Machop and its evolutionary forms are known for being quite determined, which would be a perfect personality match for Ash. Between both of their hard work and dedication to training, Machop would fit right in with Ash&#39;s Kanto team, and he met enough of those to have at least a chance to catch one.





 9  Ursaring 
        

It&#39;s clear that Ursaring would have been a force to be reckoned with, however, Ash was no stranger to taming and befriending super-powerful Pokémon when he needed to. Given that Ursaring is such a powerhouse, Ash would have done right by making it an addition to his Johto team. The evolved form of Teddiursa, this Normal-type Pokémon is known for its mighty battle moves, including Hyper Beam and Counter. While every Pokémon has its weaknesses, it would have been a power move for Ash to catch an Ursaring, or at the very least a Teddiursa.





 8  Houndour 
        

Houndoom is an iconic Pokémon from Generation 2, and its starting form Houndour isn&#39;t too shabby either. This Dark/Fire-type is best known for its Feint Attack and Flamethrower battle moves and would have definitely made for a vicious opponent. In the original series, Ash found himself taking care of and even befriending an injured Houndour, but even with the lifesaving bond between them, he chose to let it go. While it was always a good idea for Ash to value a Pokémon&#39;s well-being by valuing its happiness over his own wishes, fans selfishly wish he would have taken the good ones with him.





 7  Kecleon 
        

Due to its amazing camouflaging ability, Ash saw the Pokémon&#39;s potential from the very beginning. However, Ash never thought about catching it, even though it would provide a great advantage during battles against difficult opponents. This Normal-type Pokémon also has the special ability to use Lick and Sucker Punch against opponents, so it&#39;s no wonder Kecleon is an underrated force to use in battle. It also wouldn&#39;t hurt for fans to see more of this adorable Pokémon&#39;s personality, as it would definitely make for some entertaining times.





 6  Beartic 
        

Ash encountered a Beartic with incredibly powerful ice abilities in the episode &#34;Bearing Down Easy!&#34;. This Beartic had trouble controlling its power, accidentally freezing large areas around it, including hapless wild Pokémon. Ash, along with Misty and Brock, worked with it to learn to control its power, teaching it how to focus and control that power. Beartic returned the favor when Ash fell in a ravine and got hurt, creating a staircase of ice that helped them to escape. Despite growing close in the episode, Ash opted to allow Beartic to continue living its life in the tundra. While he missed out on a strong Pokémon, Ash was already world champion at this point, so it didn&#39;t matter too much.





 5  Sableye 
        

Arguably one of the most sneaky and mischievous Dark/Ghost-types, Sableye is one of those entertaining Pokémon that fans would have loved to see as part of Ash&#39;s team. Not only did their personalities jive, but they formed an unexpected bond in Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened, as well as the Pokémon: Advanced television series, yet he still didn&#39;t take the opportunity to catch one. Along with its quirky and entertaining personality, Sableye would have been an unexpected asset to Ash&#39;s Hoenn team. The devious Pokémon would have been especially resistant against any Fighting and Poison-types Ash would have encountered in battle, and it would have shined with its powerful use of Shadow Claw and Foul Play.





 4  Aerodactyl 
        

Ash encountered Aerodactyl in a subterranean cave, where many previously-thought-extinct Pokémon were residing. Aerodactyl broke out and went on a rampage, and ended up going toe-to-toe with Ash&#39;s Charizard in a spectacular aerial battle. Aerodactyl even carried Ash around in the air, trying to fly away with him, only to be put to sleep by Jigglypuff. Unfortunately, Jigglypuff put everyone else to sleep, too, and by the time they woke up, Aerodactyl was gone, causing Ash to miss out on the chance to catch this rare and powerful Pokémon.





 3  Suicune 
        

An underrated legendary Pokémon, Suicune is a Johto Water-type that was quick to shy away from Ash and the gang whenever spotted in the wild. However, in the Pokémon 4Ever movie, it was quick to defend Ash and his friends and even helped them out by letting them ride on its back as means of quick and safe transportation. Fans would have thought after that, Ash would surely catch Suicune after they bonded more than ever, but unfortunately, Suicune parted ways with them yet again at the end of the movie. One thing is for sure, Ash definitely needed more legendary Pokémon under his belt, and Suicune would have been a great place to start.





 2  Larvitar 
        

This Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon is one all fans can agree on wishing Ash would have captured. Ash hatched a Larvitar during his journey through Johto and even formed a close relationship with it. Though fans can agree Ash did the right thing by returning it to its mother, they can&#39;t help but think the Larvitar would have fit right in with Ash and his Pokémon gang. Not to mention once it&#39;s evolved into a Tyranitar, it becomes a lethal force in battles with its Smack Down move.





 1  Latias 
        

In Ash&#39;s final miniseries, he meets an injured Latias and nurses it back to health. He even protects it from being stolen by Team Rocket, and later helps it to free its partner Latios, which was captured by an evil Pokémon Hunter. Latias followed Ash for a long time, looking out for him as well in repayment. It was arguably the closest Ash ever came to owning a Legendary Pokémon. However, given that Latias was already being harassed by a poacher, it just didn&#39;t feel right for Ash to turn around and catch it afterward, so he ultimately allowed Latios and Latias to return home--which turned out to be Alto Mare, the land from the fifth Pokémon movie.
As can be seen in many of these situations, Ash doesn&#39;t really prioritize catching Pokémon for the sake of it but befriending and taking care of them. He often builds bonds with wild Pokémon, but that doesn&#39;t mean he has to catch them; after he&#39;s helped them with their problems, they&#39;re more than free to return to their life as it was. Ash, especially in later seasons, often waits for a Pokémon to ask to come with him before catching it, and many of the Pokémon on this list just didn&#39;t ask. While it might be disappointing to fans, this kind of behavior is what makes Pokémon&#39;s Ash Ketchum a true hero.
