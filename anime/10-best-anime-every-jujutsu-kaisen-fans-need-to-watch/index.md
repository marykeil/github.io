## Literature Review

Fans looking for more anime like Jujutsu Kaisen might enjoy these series for their epic showdowns, dark fantasy elements, and much more.





As eager fans anticipate the presently releasing episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season, they might be seeking some additional shows with common elements to treat themselves to in the meanwhile. Fans of Jujutsu Kaisen will likely enjoy one or more of these other successful series full of epic showdowns, dark fantasy and supernatural elements, and intriguing plots and fictional worlds.









 








 10  D. Gray-Man 
Both Jujutsu Kaisen and D.Gray-man are set in a world where experienced fighters combat supernatural entities that seek to prey on humanity. In Jujutsu Kaisen, viewers recognize this as the battle between Jujutsu sorcerers and curses; in D.Gray-man, its exorcists of the Black Order who fight against Akuma. Exorcists and Jujutsu sorcerers have their own distinct abilities and weapons that they use to oppose these entities, making for unique confrontations between the opposing forces. Additionally, both series are thematically darker but do tend to intersperse humorous moments with specific character interactions throughout.





 9  Demon Slayer 

Many fans of Jujutsu Kaisen may also enjoy Demon Slayer. Demon Slayer is set in a fictional Japan during the Taisho Period, where the only line of defense between humans and the flesh-eating demons that lurk in the dark are the members of the Demon Slayer Corps. Compared to the dangers they must face, Demon Slayers, like Jujutsu sorcerers, are few and far between and must undergo continuous training and self-honing in order to stay alive in the many battles they regularly face. Both Demon Slayers and Jujutsu sorcerers make use of special weaponry and skills to put a dent in enemy forces, such as the nichirin swords or cursed tools.





 8  Chainsaw Man 

Chainsaw Man follows the story of main character Denji, who makes a deal with a devil named Pochita which gives the power to transform his body parts into chainsaws. He uses this ability to fight devils as a member of the Public Safety Devil Hunters and joins fellow Devil Hunters as they tackle a variety of powerful enemies. One big similarity between both of the series&#39; main characters is that they have access to extraordinary powers as a result of the supernatural beings in their respective universes. For Denji, as mentioned, this is manifested in the deal between him and Pochita and for Itadori, in his choosing to consume the cursed Sukuna&#39;s finger.





 7  Blue Exorcist 

Blue Exorcist is a shonen anime where protagonist Rin Okumura, who has recently discovered he is an offspring of Satan, joins fellow exorcists-in-training at True Cross Academy in order to gain the power and skills to defeat Satan. In this world, there are numerous demons which exorcists of all capabilities fight against to keep the peace. There are a lot of similarities between Blue Exorcist and Jujutsu Kaisen, especially in the way that their society surrounding exorcists and Jujutsu Sorcerers are structured.
For instance, both series have ranking systems that classify exorcists and Jujutsu sorcerers based on their performance â€“ in the case of Blue Exorcist, exorcists can range anywhere from the lowest class Page up to the highest honor, Paladin. In Jujutsu Kaisen, this concept in represented in positions on the power-scaling system labeled &#34;Grades&#34;. Additionally, in both shows, the evil forces of the world are largely unknown by humanity, leaving exorcists and Jujutsu sorcerers to operate and fight in secret.





 6  Mushi-shi 

Mushi-shi is a supernatural series following the adventures of a man named Ginko as he investigates stories of unusual occurrences in hopes of learning more about otherworldly beings called Mushi and helping any humans who may be suffering as a result of their influence. Although they both incorporate supernatural elements, Mushi-shi generally focuses on the concept that not all Mushi are evil. Whereas, in Jujutsu Kaisen, Curses are the compounded result of negative emotions in humanity that then manifest into harmful creatures. Both series also contain a very limited number of individuals who are more knowledgeable about these supernatural areas of their worlds. It&#39;s worth noting that the Mushi-shi series relies on a slower pace compared to the more action-packed Jujutsu Kaisen.





 5  Natsume&#39;s Book of Friends 
        

 Similar to Mushi-shi, Natsume&#39;s Book of Friends is a series with a more measured pace that, despite containing some battles, has a more peaceful approach to contending with elements of a supernatural nature. Natsume&#39;s Book of Friends tells the story of main character Takashi Natsume, who has the ability to see yokai. One day, he inherits a book from his deceased grandmother called The Book of Friends, which he finds out contains the names of multiple yokai.
While being pursued by yokai for the power that the Book of Friends can grant, Natsume makes a deal with the spirit Madara for protection as he sets about returning all the names in the book. One big similarity between Natsume Yujincho and Jujutsu Kaisen, aside from the inclusion of the supernatural, are the main character&#39;s otherworldly abilities. There is Natsume&#39;s ability to see yokai, which seems to be a fairly uncommon trait in the series, as well as Itadori&#39;s unique strengths even before he consumed Sukuna&#39;s finger.





 4  Beyond The Boundary 
        

Beyond the Boundary is a supernatural fantasy series that centers on the story of a half-human, half-yomu named Akihito Kanbara, who meets Mirai Kuriyama through unusual circumstances. Mirai Kuriyama, he discovers, is the last survivor of a clan of Spirit World Warriors who are known for being able to manipulate their blood into a weapon. Much like curses in Jujutsu Kaisen, yoomu are a supernatural entity that exist in the world of Beyond the Boundary. Both yomu and curses, in their respective stories, are said to be manifestations of negative human emotions. As a half-yomu, Akihito possess extraordinary abilities, much like Itadori of Jujutsu Kaisen.





 3  Bleach 
        

Bleach is an action-packed shonen series that follows protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki, who acquires the abilities of what are referred to as Soul Reapers. Among friends and other Soul Reapers, Ichigo uses these new capabilities to protect humans from evil spirits and learns more about said abilities, the shinigami, the afterlife, and the supernatural world around them. Like Jujutsu Kaisen, in Bleach there exists a recently discovered force of individuals tasked with maintaining a level of peace and balance between realms of existence. Both series are also incredibly action and battle-oriented and focus on the main character and the surrounding cast&#39;s unique abilities in the face of challenging odds.





 2  Yu Yu Hakusho 
        

Being action-heavy itself, Yu Yu Hakusho is also a great shonen series for fans of Jujutsu Kaisen. Yu Yu Hakusho takes place in a world where both humans and demons exist, though the existence of supernatural entities is only recently discovered by protagonist Yusuke Urameshi after his unexpected demise.
Taking on the opportunity for a second chance at life, Yusuke is eventually proclaimed a Spirit Detective and fights alongside demons and humans to combat forces that threaten the balance of the Demon, Human, and Spirit Realms. Yusuke&#39;s role as a Spirit Detective is somewhat comparable to that of Jujutsu sorcerer. However, the sources of power in the world of Yu Yu Hakusho take the form of spirit energy, life energy, and demon energy.





 1  Mob Psycho 100 
        

 Mob Psycho 100 tells the story of middle-schooler Shigeo Kageyama, a boy who possess incredible psychic powers, which he struggles to control by suppressing his emotions. While he works as an assistant under the self-appointed medium, Arataka Reigen, he seeks to further develop his control, though his powers continue to grow much like the emotions overflowing inside of him. Both series have that strong sense of the otherworldly and supernatural existing alongside humanity and focus on characters who exist on that boundary between the &#39;ordinary&#39; and the extraordinary. Like Jujutsu Kaisen, in the world of Mob Psycho 100, there are individuals with immense power beyond that of what is human. Both Kageyama and Itadori struggle with unbelievable obstacles but are motivated by fundamentally human hopes.
There are many things that tie certain anime series together; this can be related to their genre, the themes they tackle, the types of characters they portray, and more. These comparable anime shows are united in their similarities to Jujutsu Kaisen, similarities can manifest in any number of common elements that fans enjoy. For this reason, viewers looking to see more of the elements that make Jujutsu Kaisen stand out as a series may find them just as impactful in these shows, as well.
