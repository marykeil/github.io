## Literature Review

Every Berserk adaptation has been united by one key element that really helps elevate them: epic music composed by Susumu Hirasawa.




The long-running Berserk manga has received numerous adaptations since its debut in 1989. The best-known and most acclaimed of these adaptations is the 1997 anime. In addition, there is a 2016 anime series, an anime film trilogy released between 2012 and 2013 that was eventually recut into a third anime series in 2022, and three video games. All of these adaptations are united by one key element that really helps elevate them: epic music composed by Susumu Hirasawa.






After the death of series creator Kentaro Miura in 2021, Miura&#39;s assistants have taken over the series to complete the story.




The 2010s anime adaptations of Berserk have been divisive with the fanbase due to the 3D animation style being viewed as awkward and stiff. Hirasawa&#39;s contributions to the soundtracks have been praised for their unique musical and vocal style and their suitably epic tone. Due to unforgettable musical pieces by Hirasawa, Berserk&#39;s anime adaptations have some of the best soundtracks in anime history. With Hirasawa&#39;s longstanding contributions to Berserk&#39;s music, this has been consistently true since the early episodes of the 1997 anime series.

Although Susumu Hirasawa is not well-known outside of Japan, in Japan, he has had a successful and prolific career since his career started in the early 1970s. Hirasawa&#39;s official website lists 16 soundtrack albums composed and performed by him, in addition to the numerous albums composed during both his solo career and as a member of the band P-Model. Notably, Hirasawa is no stranger to anime soundtracks. In addition to his longstanding musical work with Berserk adaptations, Hirasawa composed and performed the soundtracks for every one of the anime movies directed by the late Satoshi Kon.

Hirasawa&#39;s most famous and beloved song for the Berserk soundtrack is &#34;Forces&#34;. First playing in episode three of the 1997 anime, the epic musical tone of &#34;Forces&#34; helps elevate a fairly minor raid by the Band of the Hawk to one of Berserk&#39;s most memorable fight scenes. &#34;Forces&#34; is also the perfect summation of Hirasawa&#39;s unique musical style.




Though the heavy use of synthesized music and electronic bagpipes initially seems out of place in a medieval Fantasy world, the relentless, driving beat of the music and the lyrics about grim, steadfast determination in the face of overwhelming darkness fit Guts&#39; story arc perfectly. Variations and remixes of the original &#34;Forces&#34; have appeared throughout the Berserk franchise and have even been incorporated into Hirasawa&#39;s live performances.


 

While the more recent Berserk anime adaptations have not risen to the same level of instant classic as the original 1997 series, Susumu Hirasawa&#39;s musical contributions have helped elevate every Berserk adaptation. Thanks to Hirasawa&#39;s great music, an iconic franchise has been accompanied by an iconic soundtrack since the very first adaptations of the original manga. Awesome musical contributions from Hirasawa are the common threat shared by every adaptation of Berserk, and one of the franchise&#39;s best elements.
