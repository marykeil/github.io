## Literature Review

Code is considered a lackluster villain in Boruto, and his actions are even worse if fans connect them with Naruto&#39;s final villain, Kaguya.





The scene in question occurs when Code creates his own version of Obito&#39;s White Zetsu army from Naruto by breaking off smaller pieces of Kara&#39;s&#39;s version of the Ten-Tails in chapter #72 of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations by creator and supervisor Masashi Kishimoto, artist Mikio Ikemoto, and scriptwriter Ukyo Kodachi. This is noteworthy when considering the fact that Kaguya was the original Ten-Tails in Naruto. Code&#39;s actions can be viewed as a symbolic representation of something much deeper than just creating an army to use for the invasion of Konoha, as later seen in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.





 Boruto&#39;s Code Wants Vengeance For Kaguya&#39;s Actions 
          

As Boruto already clarified, Kaguya didn&#39;t come to Earth alone, as it was assumed when she was first introduced in Naruto. She was actually accompanied by her fellow Otsutsuki and Boruto villain Isshiki, as these alien parasites always operate in pairs: one feeds itself to a Ten-Tails to make the Chakra Tree blossom, and the other eats the result Chakra Fruit to move one step closer to ultimate godhood. However, Kaguya betrayed Isshiki and left him for dead, forcing him to steal the body of a man named Jigen. This relates to Code because Boruto established that Code greatly reveres and respects Isshiki to the point where he endeavored to become Isshiki&#39;s new vessel. In fact, the basis for Code&#39;s hatred of Kawaki is that Isshiki chose Kawaki to serve as his vessel instead of him.




Even though Code never met Kaguya and hasn&#39;t even uttered her name in Boruto, it can be assumed that he is aware of her betrayal of his &#34;god&#34;, and thus hates her for that. As revealed in Naruto, Kaguya integrated with the God Tree to take the chakra away from her sons, and she transformed into the Ten-Tails as a result. Although Kara&#39;s Ten-Tails is its own entity and isn&#39;t the resurrection of Kaguya, it&#39;s still possible that Code, crushing and cutting up Kara&#39;s Ten-Tails, was almost doing the same to Kaguya in his mind. Code would undoubtedly find delight in this since she betrayed and almost destroyed his savior Isshiki. In other words, since Kaguya was long since dead, the only chance Code could ever have of getting back at her for what she did to Isshiki would be destroying a portion of her resurrected namesake.



 Code Is An Even Worse Villain Than Fans Thought 
          




Of course, no one can definitively prove that Code ever made this distinction and hoped to somehow vicariously punish Kaguya through Kara&#39;s Ten-Tails. However, Code has been constantly represented as petty and mischievous in the series. In fact, fans almost universally believe Code to be a lackluster villain with a feeble personality, who gets humiliated every time he tries something, as happened with Boruto&#39;s epic return in Two Blue Vortex. This petty vengeance against Naruto&#39;s controversial villain Kaguya, thus, while not openly stated in Boruto, would be perfectly in line with Code&#39;s character and make him into an even more ridiculous villain.
