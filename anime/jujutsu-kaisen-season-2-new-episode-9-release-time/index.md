## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #9 will feature more of Gojo&#39;s fight against the Disaster Curses, which will push the powerful sorcerer to his limits.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode #9 Releases 
          




Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #9 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, September 21. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on September 21 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #8? 
          

Season 2 episode #8 officially kicked off the mysterious Shibuya Incident, with Gojo entering the Veil that Geto and his Curses had set up around the district. As Gojo sought out the perpetrators, Yuji and Mei Mei sought to discover the source of a secondary veil that appeared. This led to Yuji battling a Grasshopper Curse and defeating it somewhat handily. From this curse, Yuji learned that one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most twisted enemies, Mahito, was the cause of the second veil. Meanwhile, Gojo began his fight with the Curses Jogo and Hanami, who used the brutal tactic of killing and threatening various civilians to prevent Gojo from fighting at full strength.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #9 Will Bring Gojo&#39;s Fight to a Climax 
          

The end of episode #8 revealed that the Disaster Curses have to keep Gojo occupied for 20 minutes before Suguru Geto joins the fight with something that will supposedly defeat him. Given a typical Jujutsu Kaisen episode is around 20 minutes, episode #9 could potentially focus entirely on Gojo&#39;s fight with Jogo and Hanami, ending with Geto making his grand appearance. If this is the case, episode #9 will certainly be a visual spectacle showing off Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s great fight animation to the fullest. However, this might also stretch out the fight unnaturally, so the episode could also check in on what other characters are doing in Shibuya.

Given the focus Yuji got in episode #8, his chase after Mahito would be a compelling secondary plot in episode #9. Megumi and Nobara are also involved in the Shibuya Incident, so they may get some screen time as well. No matter what happens in addition to Gojo&#39;s fight though, episode #8 has already shown that the Shibuya Incident is off to an excellent start, and Studio MAPPA will likely maintain this standard of excellence for Jujutsu Kaisen going forward.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #9 when it airs on Crunchyroll on September 21, 2023.
