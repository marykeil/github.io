# Bleach Filler List Every Episode You Can Skip


## SUMMARY 



  Bleach has a staggering 165 filler episodes, which is over half of the original anime&#39;s episode count. This excessive amount of filler interrupted the main story and made the viewing experience frustrating for fans.   While most of the filler content in Bleach adds little to the series, there are a few standout episodes and arcs worth watching. Episode #132 showcases a well-written interaction between Toshiro and Karin. The Forest of Menos arc expands on the series lore and was a story that the manga author, Tite Kubo, wanted to include.   The Zanpakuto Rebellion arc is a recommended filler arc that enhances the established lore, introduces unique aspects, and features great animation and fight scenes.

## Literature Review

Bleach&#39;s original anime is infamous for how much filler it has, and here&#39;s a list of every filler episode and the few that are worth watching.




Bleach has an excessive amount of filler episodes, and here’s a list of each one that fans can safely skip. As with other long-running anime adapted from manga, Bleach often employed filler episodes and arcs to pad the show out so it wouldn’t run out of manga content to adapt. This made Bleach and many other anime like it come off as tiresome and a poor substitute for the manga, which is why one of the biggest draws of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has been that it’s adapting the final arc of the manga from start to finish without any filler.




All in all, Bleach is another long-running anime with too much filler, and here’s a list of every episode that can be skipped. While the definition of filler in media has become somewhat nebulous in recent years, for anime adaptations, it’s generally accepted that it’s filler if it wasn’t in the source material. It should also be stated that none of this is necessarily a criticism of the episodes; there are many times that filler episodes provide great content, but that doesn’t change the fact that they can be skipped, and bleaches are no exception.

When added all together, Bleach has a total of 165 filler episodes, over half of the original anime’s episode account. Calling that egregious would be an understatement, and what made them even worse was that because of how long Bleach’s canon arcs were, the filler episodes would often cause the story to simply stop for months to tell a story completely unrelated to what people were just watching. For anyone who watched Bleach as it aired, that practice undoubtedly made the experience worse than it needed to be, and with how often the content was tedious stories that detracted from the established canon, it was almost always impossible to justify.



 Is Any Of Bleach’s Filler Worth Watching? 
          

While most of Bleach’s filler content adds very little to the series, there are some filler episodes and arcs that aren’t without their merit. Episode #132, “Hitsugaya, Karin, and Soccer Ball”, for example, is a surprisingly good episode for how well Toshiro and Karin play off of each other and for being one of the only times Karin gets any meaningful character work. The Forest of Menos arc is also worth watching for how it expands on the series lore, and that especially makes sense when considering how it was a story Tite Kubo had wanted to write in the manga, but didn’t have the time for.






The one filler arc that should definitely be skipped is the Bount Arc due to its excessive length, lack of engaging characters, and how much it messes with the pacing of the anime.




If there’s any filler that should definitely be watched, however, it’s the Zanpakuto Rebellion arc. Unlike the other long filler arcs of the anime, the conflict in the Zanpakuto Rebellion arc doesn’t clash with the established lore, only enhancing it, and having a chance to see everyone’s Zanpakuto spirits and their personalities gave the arc a great hook, especially since those aspects and others would later be incorporated into canon. Add in some great animation and fight scenes, and the arc perfectly shows that while most of Bleach’s filler wasn’t worth watching, there were definitely some gems every so often.
