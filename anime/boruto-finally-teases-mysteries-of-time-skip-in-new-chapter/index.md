## Literature Review

The official website for Naruto teased that the upcoming chapter of Boruto will dive into the time skip and potentially reveal its mysteries.




Ahead of the next chapter&#39;s release, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex received a sneak peek that confirms that chapter #5 will go back in time and clear the air about what happened in the time skip. There are a lot of mysteries regarding what Boruto did while he was away, and hopefully, this chapter will answer some of those questions.




The official website for the Naruto franchise posted a picture that hints at the next chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex. The image shows Sasuke and a jovial Boruto talking, implying that there will be a flashback chapter that explains what happened during the 3 years Boruto was away.


 

After a nail-biting cliffhanger in chapter #4, many were left puzzled as to how the mighty Sasuke Uchiha was caught by the Ten Tail&#39;s Grimes. Fans may find out how Sasuke was incapacitated and Boruto&#39;s reaction to that incident.

                  Boruto Shocks Fans Confirming Sasuke&#39;s Fate Is Much Worse Than They Thought   It has been speculated that Sasuke would be killed off in Boruto, but the newest chapter reveals his actual fate is much worse than that.   





 Future Chapters Might Focus On Boruto&#39;s Rogue Years 
          

The picture depicts the master and the student sitting down and having a conversation. This simple image dispelled many rumors that Boruto inherited his items, such as the cloak and sword. Boruto is also asking Sasuke about his progress in the Uchiha style of fighting. This makes fans wonder if Boruto is now able to use Fire Style, the Uchiha Clan&#39;s signature jutsu. This wholesome moment is sure to make the events of the present even more heartbreaking considering how much Boruto adored Sasuke.

The previous chapters dropped many bombshells that chapter #5 alone can&#39;t cover. Although there is a high probability that it will go through how Sasuke was caught by the Grime and turned into a tree, Boruto&#39;s intense training might also be a key focus. His fighting style has shifted a lot to that of a swordsman, so it will be very interesting to see how Sasuke was able to train him to become proficient in the weapon. He also couldn&#39;t have possibly mastered Rasengan Uzuhiko or Flying Raijin Justu without the guidance of Sasuke, giving his training arc even more potential if Kishimoto decides to go that route.




                  Boruto Two Blue Vortex&#39;s New Villains Are The Franchise&#39;s Most Powerful Ever   Boruto introduced new villains that rival the likes of Akatsuki and Kara, and are bound to be the strongest to ever appear in the series.   

Although flashbacks in such an exciting story might seem boring, there is a lot that happened while Boruto was running for his life. From Code hunting him down to meeting the long-awaited Kashin Koji, a break from the main story to shed light will be crucial to understanding Boruto&#39;s growth. The beloved main character is now a former shell of himself, as he went from a bubbly boy to a depressed teen. Sasuke&#39;s fate had a huge impact on him, and showing how close they were and how it went awry will give more depth to Boruto: Two Blue Vortex and show that it is not in Naruto&#39;s shadow anymore.
