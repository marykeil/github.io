## Literature Review

After months of silence about its production and release date, the upcoming Go! Go! Loser Ranger! anime finally gives fans new exciting information. 





As revealed in a trailer posted to the official Shochiko Anime Studio YouTube channel, the series will debut in 2024. While this means that it can drop in any one of the four - Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall - traditional anime seasons, just the fact that it will occur within the next year is good news for its fans. In addition to the promotional video, fans were also treated to a new teaser poster that was posted to @anime_sentai, the official Go! Go! Loser Ranger! X (formerly Twitter) account.





 Go! Go! Loser Ranger! Is A Dark And Exciting Spin On The Traditional Power Rangers Shows 

 

Although the series is not specifically about the Mighty Morphin&#39; Power Rangers, it is a must-watch for fans of that franchise and of Super Sentai shows in general. The story, which is an adaptation of Negi Haruba&#39;s ongoing Sentai Daishikkaku manga, famously tweaks Power Rangers tropes and flips the script on the whole Super Sentai genre. Indeed, its focus is not specifically on a Ranger team, but rather on the Power Ranger villains - called Putty Patrolmen in the original show, the cannon fodder minions of the powerful, evil alien &#34;Executives&#34;. It explores the question of what happens when a bunch of the evil foot soldiers are so fed up with being sent by their overlords into unwinnable fights against the Power Rangers that they decide to take their lives into their own hands.




          

The story also gives the actual Dragon Keepers - the Rangers of the series - their time to shine, thus presenting a compelling double-sided view of good and evil, as the protagonist&#39;s goal is to kill what are, in fact, heroes. After the anime was originally announced in December 2022, no further news about when it would debut was provided, until this latest announcement. Over the year, the fear among more than a few fans was that it might never get made. During that time, a single promotional video was the only &#34;sustenance&#34; fans had to slate their interest. That video, however, was breathtaking and showed how potentially good an anime series could be.



 Go! Go! Loser Ranger! Has A Solid Creative Team Behind It 
          




More signs that Go! Go! Loser Rangers! is set up for success can be found in the creative team behind it. The show is being directed by Keiichiro Ochi who has extensive experience in the industry including work on the new anime sensation Under Ninja, Tiger &amp; Bunny, Black Butler, and the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. In addition, the series is being produced by Yostar Pictures, the anime house that brought Azur Lane, Arknights, and Blue Archive to the screen. Not only fans of the Powers Rangers, but manga and anime fans in general should keep their eyes open for when Go! Go! Loser Ranger! debuts in 2024.
