## Literature Review

It can be difficult to decide which manga from Shonen Jump&#39;s large catalog are worth investing time into, but these are the ten best to read in 2024.




Shonen Jump is gearing up for an exciting year in 2024. With multiple long-running series ending and many exciting new series just getting started, it&#39;s the perfect time for new readers to pick up the magazine. While it can be hard to know which series are worth the time to get into, there are ten that stand out from the rest as particularly notable in 2024.
Getting into new Shonen Jump manga can be risky, given the magazine has aggressively canceled fledgling manga in the past. This has led to the creation of the so-called Under 19 Club, which contains a growing list of promising manga cut short before their time. However, with two of its most popular series scheduled to end in 2024, Shonen Jump will likely be hesitant to cancel the new manga that might have a chance to replace them, meaning new series will hopefully be given the time they deserve to tell their truly exciting stories.
Beyond those new series there are plenty of other longer-running manga that also deserve more readers’ attention, whether it&#39;s because they have an upcoming anime adaptation or just because they are taking the Shonen genre to exciting new places.









 








 10  My Hero Academia 
Created by Kohei Horikoshi


 







My Hero Academia is one of the extremely popular Shonen Jump series wrapping up in 2024, which makes it a perfect time to get caught up. While the final arc of the series has been somewhat divisive among fans, it still has a lot of incredible moments and will likely receive even more in 2024. The one downside to catching up to this series in 2024 is that as of the current chapter, it seems incredibly close to ending so there may not be much more of it to enjoy. Still, fans who can catch up in time will be able to witness the ending of one of the most iconic Shonen series in recent years.

Created by Naoya Matsumoto
        

One of the most exciting anime scheduled for release in 2024 is Kaiju No. 8, an innovative manga released on Shonen Jump&#39;s Jump&#43; service. The series follows the middle-aged Kafka Hibino, who after gaining the ability to transform into a Kaiju is able to follow his dreams and join the Japanese Defense Force to protect the country against monsters. While later arcs of the series lose a bit of the innovative edge that made the manga so exciting in the beginning, it is still definitely worth reading, especially with the anime sure to cause a lot of buzz when it releases.

 8  Cipher Academy 
Written by Nisioisin with art by Yuji Iwasaki
        

Cipher Academy is a mind-bending manga written by the author of the Monogatari series. The series has one of the most unique settings and fighting systems in Shonen Jump right now, focusing on a school dedicated to codes. The puzzles in the series force its characters into Death Note-style mind games that are incredibly complex and engaging, which causes it to feel refreshingly different from the magazine&#39;s more typical action series. The large cast of characters is also incredibly fun, with each one approaching these code battles in a different way. 2024 is the perfect time to start reading one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most innovative series.

 7  Sakamoto Days 
Created by Yuto Suzuki
        

Sakamoto Days is one of the best action series in Shonen Jump right now, boasting impressive choreography and characters with unique fighting styles. The series follows an ex-hitman named Sakamoto who must reenter the seedy world of assassins after someone puts a target on his back. The series is incredibly reminiscent of John Wick in that regard, but its fights may even outclass those of that revered action franchise. It is shocking that this series hasn&#39;t received an anime adaptation yet, but readers who pick it up in 2024 may have a chance to see the hype around it before it&#39;s on many anime fans’ radars.

 6  Kagurabachi 
Created by Takeru Hokazono
        

Upon its release, Kagurabachi took the manga community by storm due to its explosive popularity, especially among Western readers. However, while the manga may not be the best series ever as its famous meme contends, it is still an incredibly fun series, with epic fight scenes and a brutal world that is reminiscent of other manga like Jujutsu Kaisen. The story so far is pretty typical, following the teenage swordsman Chihiro as he tracks down and gets revenge on his father&#39;s killers. But given the vast amount of hype this series has behind it and its great potential, 2024 is the perfect time to read this manga.

 5  The Elusive Samurai 
Created by Yusei Matsui
        

The Elusive Samurai is an underrated manga by Assassination Classroom author Yusei Matsui. It is a historical drama following the young Tokiyuki Hojo as he attempts to reclaim his rule from the shogunate that displaced his father&#39;s dynasty. Even for readers who don&#39;t know much about Japanese history, it is a great read, filled with creative characters and fights that play with its setting in innovative ways. This is another series with an anime on the way in 2024, making it the perfect time to dive into this manga before it gets really big.
This series also has one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most disturbing villains

 4  Akane-banashi 
Created by Yuki Suenaga and Takamasa Moue


 







Akane-banashi is one of Shonen Jump&#39;s least typical manga. Instead of focusing on action or sports, it follows a young girl named Akane as she becomes a Rakugoka, a performer specializing in a unique form of Japanese comedy called Rakugo. This may sound too specific to be interesting, but the way Yuki Suenaga and Takamasa Moue portray Rakugo transforms performances into intense battles, with each character having their own motivations and style. The manga is even good enough to receive praise from One Piece&#39;s author Eiichiro Oda. 2024 is the perfect time to get caught up with the series while it remains one of Shonen Jump&#39;s hidden gems.

 3  Jujutsu Kaisen 
Created by Gege Akutami
        

Many readers dropped Jujutsu Kaisen during the divisive and lengthy Culling Game arc. However, the series is now in its final arc and it is the best it has been since the Shibuya Incident arc. Mangaka Gege Akutami has stated that he intends to end Jujutsu Kaisen in 2024, and based on current events in the manga, he clearly intends to end it with a bang. In addition to the series being excellent right now, spoilers for recent events spread like wildfire after every chapter, making getting caught up more necessary than ever for fans who don&#39;t want to be spoiled on the many twists and turns at the end of the series.
This series is almost over but it will likely last a bit longer than My Hero Academia will.

 2  One Piece 
Created by Eiichiro Oda


 







One Piece is already one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most popular series. For readers who have been intimidated by its massive chapter count, now is the perfect time to dive into the series. The live-action series provides a great alternative to the manga&#39;s first hundred chapters. The anime and the manga are also the best that they&#39;ve been in years, with the current Egghead Island arc revealing a lot of questions fans have been wondering about for years. The franchise even announced recently that it will be creating another anime to remake the current one, an unprecedented move that is sure to bring even more fans into the series.
