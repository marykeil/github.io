## Literature Review

Luffy in his Gear 5 form seemed unstoppable but a major weakness seen during his battle against Kaido has just resurfaced again in One Piece.





During Luffy&#39;s epic final clash with Kaido on top of Onigashima, almost all of Kaido’s attacks didn’t work against Gear 5&#39;s cartoonish abilities. Frustrated, Kaido went into his dragon form and used his powers to shot multiple air slashes at Luffy, saying that no matter what, gum-based powers should still be vulnerable to cutting, and this proved to be the case. Chapter #1093 of One Piece proved that Kaido was indeed right. After Luffy activated Gear 5 to fight against the overwhelmingly powerful Admiral Kizaru, the crafty Marine uses his powers to create a laser sword and uses it to slash Luffy, who starts bleeding from his cheek and even says out loud that the attack hurt him.





 Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 Isn&#39;t As Invincible As It Seems 
          

Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 took the world by storm. Its debut in the manga was debated for months, and then, when it appeared in the anime too, Gear 5 broke the internet by crashing the servers of the most popular streaming services. Fans are well aware that this transformation is the result of Luffy awakening his Devil Fruit powers, after the revelation that Gumo Gumo no Mi was a fake name created to hide the true nature of a Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit that gives the owner the powers of the legendary Sun God Nika. In that form, Luffy&#39;s rubber powers extend to the world around him, allowing him to fight with absolute freedom and essentially transform reality into a cartoon.

Gear 5 immediately looked overpowered. During the battle against Kaido, even after the former Yonko claimed to have found his weakness, Luffy powered through the flurry of slashes, so that apparent weakness seemed not very relevant. However, seeing it appear again in the story proves that this weakness exists indeed, and it could surely become relevant in the future. It&#39;s also interesting that Luffy’s weakness is swordsmen. The world of One Piece boasts many incredible swordsmen like Mihawk and Fujitora, but the Straw Hat captain lacks experience in fighting them, a job that is usually reserved to Zoro.






 One Piece Did The Right Thing In Giving Gear 5 A Weakness 
          

Luckily, when Luffy goes into Gear 5, his physical attributes are significantly boosted. He becomes extremely fast, and so he&#39;ll be able to dodge sword attacks. In addition to his speed, he also has the Future Sight Haki, which allows him to predict what an opponent&#39;s attacks. Still, it&#39;s very good to note that Eiichiro Oda has not forgotten to give Gear 5 a weakness. While this transformation is already a modern classic, its strange abilities seemed almost unstoppable, which would inevitably lower the stakes of any fight Luffy will be in. Instead, One Piece has now confirmed that even the absurd Gear 5 has a weakness, proving that Luffy&#39;s strongest form is far from unbeatable.

The latest chapter of One Piece is available from Viz Media.
