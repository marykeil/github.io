Summary

  The anime Opening of One Piece&#39;s Egghead Arc reveals upcoming fights, outfits, and hints about crucial events in the manga.   The arc features epic battles that surpass those in the previous Wano arc, with confrontations like Luffy vs. Lucci and Zoro vs. a particular Seraphim.   The Opening introduces the tragic backstory of Kuma and Bonney, reveals what happened during the Reverie clash, and teases the appearance of Dr. Vegapunk and his satellites.  







The One Piece anime&#39;s incredibly anticipated Egghead Arc has finally begun, and with it comes the series&#39; most stylish intro yet, which is packed with exciting teases for what&#39;s to come. Luffy, Kid, and Law all set out in different directions after defeating two Yonkos during the Wano arc. While each of the Worst Generation Pirates has their work cut out for them in what lies ahead, viewers receive some well-hidden (and some not so well-hidden) clues about what lies ahead for them and anime fans.

Like the intro before it, One Piece&#39;s anime Opening 26 features some spoilers for the upcoming arc that the Toei adaptation is beginning to produce. While many of the spoilers don&#39;t give too much away, others blatantly reveal upcoming fights, outfits, and hints about crucial events that have happened in the manga&#39;s Egghead Island arc.


 




Manga readers have been getting spoiled with author Eiichiro Oda&#39;s latest arc, which has been one of One Piece&#39;s most satisfying to consume. Despite Wano&#39;s vast amount of intense battles, the upcoming anime arc is filled with confrontations that will shock viewers with a plethora of unexpected matchups that thrilled manga readers over the past year. Eagle-eyed viewers have spotted many surprises in Opening 26 of One Piece&#39;s anime, which features the catchy song &#34;Us!&#34; by Hiroshi Kitadani. Still, some of the Opening&#39;s spoilers are more puzzling than others.


 Egghead&#39;s Fights Will Scramble Viewer&#39;s Brains 
         

While the previous Wano arc contained epic fights such as Big Mom Vs. Kid and Law, Zoro Vs. King, and Gear 5 Luffy Vs. Kaido, Egghead&#39;s intro shows off several battles that may surpass Wano&#39;s. As the intro teases, Luffy and Lucci will have an epic reunion, and Zoro will confront a particular Seraphim that&#39;ll provide his next big hurdle in his dream to become One Piece&#39;s greatest swordsman. However, the arc surprisingly deviates away from the Straw Hats location to provide other epic clashes featuring Blackbeard against Law, Shanks against Kid, and Garp against former Admiral (now Blackbeard Pirate) Kuzan! Epic battles will be plentiful in the Egghead arc, but so will moments of tear-inducing drama.






 The Truly Tragic Tale Of Bonney And Kuma 
          

One of the most surprising series of teases in the Egghead Opening includes material that takes place late into the arc revolving around the heartbreaking backstory of Bartholomew Kuma and his daughter Bonney. An entire timeline of Kuma&#39;s life, including his role in creating the Marine&#39;s Pacifistas and his deep connection with Jewelry Bonney, are explored late in the arc.

          

The intro includes scenes involving Kuma breaking through restraints and Bonney discovering her father&#39;s memories. These events elude to an extensive Kuma-focused flashback, which the One Piece manga only recently concluded in chapter #1102â€”events the anime will likely take around a year to reach.




                  One Piece Is About To Get Its Most Tearful Reunion, &amp; It&#39;s Not Luffy &amp; Shanks   The Egghead arc has set up one incredible One Piece reunion that will be hard to top, even for Luffy and Shanks.   



 The Reverie&#39;s Secret And The Ones Who Know It 
         

Despite the Reverie taking place before the Wano arc, Egghead finally reveals what really happened during the shocking clash that occurred at the World Government&#39;s headquarters of Marijoa. Opening 26 includes short sequences of Sabo&#39;s encounter with the evil secret ruler of One Piece&#39;s world, Imu. Sabo&#39;s and Imu&#39;s attacks are only shown briefly, but anime viewers were not the only ones to get a peek at the skirmish between the King of the World and the Revolutionary Army&#39;s Chief of Staff.

Conveniently, King Wapol witnessed the scene of Imu&#39;s attack on Sabo and King Cobra. In a desperate (and intelligent) bid to survive, Wapol fled the World Government castle and accidentally saved a captive Princess Vivi while running for his life. While the amount of convenience borders on lazy writing, many of One Piece&#39;s earth-shaking revelations are put into motion by Wapol and Vivi&#39;s escape with Big News Morgans. His harboring of Wapol, Vivi, and the increased prominence of his control over the world&#39;s newspapers are referenced in the Egghead intro consistently with images of his News Coo&#39;s throughout.






 Captain Coby and The Living Island 
          

The One Piece anime adapted Coby&#39;s encounter with Blackbeard and Boa Hancock on Amazon Lily in episode #1087, but it&#39;s not the last time fans see Luffy&#39;s marine rival during the Egghead arc. Marshall D. Teach&#39;s base of operation, Hachinosu, holds many of the Yonko&#39;s prisoners, guarded by several of Blackbeard&#39;s Titanic Captains, including Aokiji. Opening 26 shows an incredible shot of Koby and fellow SWORD member Hibari attempting to run from a very lively and mountainous foe. Koby and SWORD&#39;s time on Blackbeard&#39;s HQ is one of the arc&#39;s biggest highlights, and the new intro only increases the hype for its adaptation.

                  One Piece Just Gave Koby The Best Backstory Ever, But Fans Missed It   One Piece&#39;s story has seen Koby grow into a powerful Marine. However, a new untold backstory makes Luffy&#39;s rival more admired than thought possible.   






 Introducing Dr. Vegapunk, All Of Them 
         

Dr.Vegapunk, along with his inventions and reputation, had come up at several moments in One Piece&#39;s long story, and the Egghead arc finally introduces the critical character, all seven of him. The latest anime intro shows each of Vegapunk&#39;s satalities, each who provide a vital function for the high-functioning doctor, hovering above his head until his main body appears. However, agents from the World Government can be seen behind the main Vegapunk (aka The Stella), teasing both the mystery and danger One Piece&#39;s most intelligent man has ahead of him.

                  Dr. Vegapunk&#39;s True Identity in One Piece Explained   Throughout the Egghead Island arc One Piece has been revealing more about the identity of the mysterious scientist Dr Vegapunk and his satellites.   






 A Giant Return For Gear 5 Luffy 
          

Luffy unlocking the powerful Gear 5 during Wano was incredibly adapted in the One Piece anime, especially the moment the Straw Hat Captain turned into a giant, a move he repeats during one of Egghead&#39;s best battles. The new anime intro shows the laughing Yonko towering over Egghead Island&#39;s buildings while clouds wrap around him. Thankfully, the intro does not spoil who Luffy is battling while in this form. Still, anime-only viewers should be excited to see Gum-Gum Giant again and know that a foe strong enough to need it will be in the anime soon.

                  One Piece Finally Explains Why Gear 5 Is So Powerful   The One Piece manga&#39;s portrayal of Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 is awesome, but the anime&#39;s adaptation makes it even more powerful in ways the manga never could.   






 The Warriors Who Fall, And Those Who Pick Themselves Up 
         

Oda warned during his yearly Jump Fest address that 2023&#39;s Egghead Arc would host many moments that&#39;d feel like a battle royale of epic clashes, and not everyone would make it outstanding. One exquisitely directed section of Opening 26 shows fan-favorite characters, like Kid and Law, in bad shape and beginning to fall over. Manga readers know the unfortunate fate of those characters and why Coby is the only one to rise into the light in a piece of brilliant foreshadowing of who wins and loses in their Egghead arc battles.



 A Darkened Relationship With The Man Of Light 
          




Much like the surprising inclusion of hints regarding Kuma and Bonney&#39;s heartbreaking backstory, the intro also teases moments including a young Sentomaru and the Light Devil Fruit using Admiral Kizaru. The two play essential roles in later sections of the arc, particularly involving Bonney and Dr.Vegapunk, which the One Piece manga only recently covered.

          

 It may take some time to reach the Sentomaru and Kizaru heavy moments. Still, with them included in the incredible Opening 26, the catchy intro could be planned to be used longer than One Piece&#39;s Opening 25 was.
