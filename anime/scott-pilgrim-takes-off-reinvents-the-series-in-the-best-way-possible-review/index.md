## Literature Review

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off features Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley&#39;s beloved characters like never before in a new story filled with humor &amp; shattered expectations.




Warning: Minor Spoilers For Scott Pilgrim Takes OffNetflix&#39;s anime Scott Pilgrim Takes Off sees the return of the titular Scott, Ramona Flowers, and the rest of Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley&#39;s beloved characters in a new story that quickly defies all expectations of a fan base that&#39;s hopefully matured as much as its author. Viewers who expected an anime adaptation of the same Scott Pilgrim story seen in O&#39;Malley&#39;s 2004 comic and Edgar Wright&#39;s outstanding feature film, 2010&#39;s Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, may be disappointed that Takes Off is very different. However, fans hungry for a storyline that thoroughly explores and adds layers to the beloved cast are in for a treat.






While Scott Pilgrim Takes Off can be enjoyed on its own, it&#39;s recommended to at least watch the 2010 movie to understand some of the series&#39; jokes and plot twists.




Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World struck a chord with a generation of 20-somethings who, like Scott, had trouble getting their lives together. The pop culture references and the plot structure, like a video game where the hero must defeat stronger and stronger bosses to win the girl, made the series a cult classic. While that formula worked for the time, writers Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley and BenDavid Grabinski decided to create something entirely new. 

          

 The original story&#39;s fast-paced, epic action and one-dimension characters have been swapped for an introspective noir story where Scott Pilgrim takes off from the story to give the true star of the show more focus, that character being Ramona Flowers.




                  Scott Pilgrim Takes Off Cast Guide: Every Actor &amp; Their Character In The Animated Scott Pilgrim Netflix Series   The anime brings the story to life in two dimensions with the entire cast from the original live-action movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World returning.    


 Ramona Flowers Is No Longer Just A Prize To Win 
          

Any fan of the Scott Pilgrim franchise will find the first episode to be a comfortable blanket that expertly adapts O&#39;Malley&#39;s rounded art style with superb animation and excellent voice direction from the 2010 film&#39;s cast. While many of the story&#39;s first beats will feel familiar, everything unravels once Scott loses his first Evil Ex fight against Matthew Patel. Like any audience who is familiar with the series, Ramona suspects that something is not right. She begins her adventure to discover what happened to Scott and who was responsible. While many may assume it was Gideon Graves, the leader of the League of Evil Exes, the show quickly defies expectations repeatedly.






The Netflix series is filled with meta-humor and easter eggs that will likely delight fans of the Scott Pilgrim comic, movie, and video game.




The consistent action from the comic and Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie has been toned down to tell a story that feels more layered than waiting for the next Evil Ex to show up to fight. Within the series&#39; first two episodes (of eight), even readers of the O&#39;Malley comic will not know where the story is heading next, making Scott Pilgrim Takes Off an entirely new storyline, not an adaptation of previous work. To find out whodunit, Ramona confronts each of her Evil Exes, causing both her and Scott Pilgrim&#39;s stellar cast of characters to analyze themselves to the audience&#39;s benefit.



 By Removing Scott, The Story Focuses On More Interesting Characters 
          




Each character from Scott Pilgrim&#39;s cast gets moments to shine throughout the series, some more than others like Ramona, Wallace, and Young Neil. As each Evil Ex is more thoroughly explored and put into often hilarious and unexpected situations, it becomes much easier to get invested in each character now that they don&#39;t exist for the sole purpose of trying to beat up their ex-girlfriend&#39;s newest love interest. After the mystery is solved, everything culminates into an exciting and incredibly well-animated final act that effectively makes Scott Pilgrim Takes Off a sequel series, with a satisfying ending that keeps the story open for a much-deserved continuation.

         

While Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&#39;s pacing feels less action-packed than previous adaptations, the franchise&#39;s humor and charm return with full force. From Wallace Well&#39;s amazing ability to steal any scene he&#39;s in to the new relationships that the Evil Exes encounter throughout the first season, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off effectively renovates the beloved franchise and its memorable characters. Still, there are more than a couple of visually outstanding action scenes in the Scott Pilgrim anime that&#39;d cost more than Avatar to make in live-action.






 Scott Pilgrim Takes Off Isn&#39;t What Fans Expected, It&#39;s What They Needed 

 

The style that oozed from O&#39;Malley&#39;s comic and Edgar Wright&#39;s film were different but effectively built a style identity that captured Scott Pilgrim&#39;s vibe. Thanks to the visuals from studio Science Saru and the music from Anamanaguchi (who also created the earworm music for the Scott Pilgrim video game), Scott Pilgrim Takes Off creates a third style that also definitely feels like Scott Pilgrim. Science Saru&#39;s previous work on series like Devilman Crybaby and Star Wars: Visions helped the studio make a worldwide name for itself. It&#39;s work on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off has elevated the studio to new heights with its flashy, well-choreographed action scenes and adorable character animations.

Like Netflix&#39;s Live-Action One Piece, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is another brilliant example of what a beloved franchise can accomplish when creative control is given to its creator in adapting its characters into a different medium. While the anime is not the adaption most fans were expecting, diehard fans of the series looking for a new storyline filled with the charm and humor Scott Pilgrim is known for that thoroughly dives into the characters they love will have a lot to enjoy with Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.
