## Literature Review

In a medium that typically focuses on unrealistic and ideal scenarios, it is always noteworthy when anime has a relevant message to convey.





Social commentary can come in a variety of different forms, ranging from subtle to obvious. Sometimes, the main purpose of a title seems to be the idea of bringing up and discussing subjects that are relevant in modern politics, albeit with fantastical or supernatural twists. Other times, this commentary is not nearly as noticeable, playing less of a role in the story, but still just as important.
            
 
 Manga Has Always Been Political, Western Readers Just Never Realized it 
While many claim that manga&#39;s popularity is due to its lack of politics, a closer look reveals that politics are ingrained into the medium.












 








 10  Kino&#39;s Journey 
        

Kino&#39;s Journey follows the titular Kino who, together with her talking motorcycle Hermes, travels around different countries, always acting only as an observer. In spite of her young age, Kino is mature, and never lets herself be controlled by her emotions; she remains neutral and makes no attempt to change anyone, no matter how absurd she may find their lives. The places they travel to vary greatly, and so do the people they meet. As if emphasizing and discussing different issues and ideas of humanity, each place has specific customs and cultures, and they all make for great opportunities to learn from.





 9  Penguindrum 
        

Penguindrum is infamous for being one of the most experimental and free-form shows in the medium, and rightfully so. The story follows the Takakura family, which consists of two twin brothers and their sickly little sister. After nearly succumbing to her illness, Himari&#39;s death is somehow stopped by her penguin hat, and a new entity starts controlling her body, asking the boys to search for the mysterious &#34;Penguin Drum&#34; in exchange for keeping their sister alive. The bizarre narrative and unusual symbolism combine to create a story whose meaning and themes are largely up to interpretation, yet which always impacts viewers all the same.





 8  Girls&#39; Last Tour 
        

Girls&#39; Last Tour revolves around two girls, Chito and Yuuri, the last survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. As civilization is dead, and their world is empty, it would make sense for them to have a hopeless outlook on life, but that is not the case. As such, this seemingly depressive title is, in fact, an iyashikei (slice of life) one. Even though they occasionally feel lonely, and they wander around aimlessly on their Kettenkrad motorbike, the girls never give up or fall into despair. Instead, they focus on surviving every day, curiously investigating the surrounding ruins, and finding excitement in every new thing they learn, staying positive even in the most bleak of situations.





 7  Odd Taxi 
        

Though ostensibly presented as a title about anthropomorphic animals linked by the case of a missing girl, Odd Taxi proves to be much more than that. The story follows Hiroshi Odokawa, a walrus taxi driver who gets caught up in more trouble than he bargained for. However, while the mystery is explored in the background, the show does a lot to describe and develop its characters as well, as everyone Hiroshi interacts with is intriguing and realistic. From people suffering from mental health issues, to those struggling with addiction or an unhealthy obsession with social media, various different issues are competently presented.





 6  Gatchaman Crowds 
        

The events of Gatchaman Crowds take place in Tachikawa City, where heroes known as Gatchaman fight against dangerous aliens called MESS, using the power of NOTE, special reinforced suits that grant them increased abilities. A recent recruit of the Gatchaman is Hajime Ichinose, an energetic girl who is perhaps not fully prepared for the power and responsibilities associated with her role. Instead of being presented as flawless heroes, the Gatchaman are realistic and genuine, and they are not above making mistakes, as the right answer is not always evident. Moreover, the show also goes into the dangers of mass media and how they can influence public perception.





 5  Revolutionary Girl Utena 
        

Revolutionary Girl Utena follows the titular Utena Tenjou, a girl who was once saved by a person she believed to be a prince, who thus inspired her to become a prince herself. Though that may seem confusing, the truth is that Utena was never bound by social expectations or gender norms, and always refused to submit to others. This is how she ends up caught in a series of enigmatic duels fought over ownership of the Rose Bride Anthy Himemiya, whom she wants to save from being objectified. This highly metaphorical story discusses a variety of subjects, that range from childhood idealism and identity to abuse and adulthood.

 4  Welcome to the N.H.K. 
        

Tatsuhiro Satou is a NEET with profound phobias of society and the outside world, who, having dropped out of college and isolated himself in his room, has come to believe in the most obscure conspiracy theories. The one that seems to affect him the most is the supposed existence of the Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (NHK), an evil organization intent on turning Japan&#39;s youth into hikikomori. Welcome to the N.H.K. follows his journey and attempt to get better, together with Misaki Nakahara, who is also ailed by her own issues. This title openly presents common psychological issues and how they are generally treated by society at large, often being ignored.





 3  Aggretsuko 
        

Aggretsuko revolves around the titular protagonist Retsuko, an office worker who is often given far more work than appropriate, and whose main form of stress relief is death metal. Even though the characters are anthropomorphic animals, they are more realistic than most human characters. Given the setting of the title, it is only natural that most of its social commentary and themes have to do with the workplace, with all of its inherent drama and problems such as work-life balance, a common issue in Japan. However, the show often goes beyond this, touching on broader issues of modern Japanese society and young adults in particular, such as mental health and the pressure of settling down.





 2  Planetes 
        

While most other Sci-Fi anime shows would focus on the marvels of space travel and exploring new planets, Planetes is completely different. Here, the fact that people travel between Earth and the Moon on a daily basis is a dull reality. The story opts to follow the lives of the Debris Section of the Technora Corporation, whose members are tasked with the important yet underappreciated duty of clearing space debris that can significantly damage ships and equipment. Throughout its runtime, the story also brings up various topics such as the relationship between countries of different levels of development, views on ecology, and the issues of hierarchic corporations.





 1  Beastars 
        

The events of Beastars take place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where, even though all kinds of animals may seem to live together in peace and harmony, there is in fact a lot of tension between carnivores and herbivores. Moreover, this friction only gets worse at Cherryton Academy, after an alpaca ends up dying to a carnivorous animal. Although the characters may not be human per se, they make for an excellent allegory for dark subject matter such as discrimination and racism. Other subjects are also touched upon, such as how society may view sexuality and how instincts may interfere with desires.
As proven by the entries on this list, one thing that may seem particularly surprising about these shows is how they are often characterized by Sci-Fi or otherwise unrealistic settings, in spite of their efforts to discuss real and genuine issues that ail modern society. From micro-level issues such as work-life balance, identity, and mental health, to macro-level ones such as discrimination and geopolitics, no topic is too controversial to be mentioned. As such, anime with social commentary stand out through their attempt to make a visible positive impact.
