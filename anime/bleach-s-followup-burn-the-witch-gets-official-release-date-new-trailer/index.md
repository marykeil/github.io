## Literature Review

Burn The Witch&#39;s new season has just got a release date, and it is much sooner than fans of Bleach&#39; creator Tite Kubo expected.





This prequel of Burn the Witch was announced on September 17 with a short trailer accompanying it. This came after a teaser at the ending of episode #9 of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, and fans were beyond excited as the series had been radio silent since 2020.





 

On October 23, 2023, the official website of Burn The Witch released a new trailer for the anime, along with the announcement that the series will air on December 29, 2023. Alongside the trailer came a gorgeous key visual and more information on the staff and cast. Titled Burn the Witch #0.8, the series will be a prequel to the first Burn the Witch season that aired in 2020, and will cover how the main characters Ninny and Noel met.

The website announced the staff and cast, most of whom are returning. Studio Colorido and team Yamahitsuji will return to bring the manga to life, and Tatsuro Kawano will direct the new season again. The voice actors for Ninny Spangcole, Noel Niihashi, and Balgo Parks will all retain their positions. A new character called Shelby will be introduced, and he will be voiced by the talent behind Todo Aoi from Jujutsu Kaisen, Subaru Kimura. The trailer featured the theme song &#34;PROVE&#34; by NiL, who also performed the ending song of Burn The Witch season 1.

          

Based on a one-shot by Tite Kubo, Burn the Witch appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump for four chapters, and was later adapted into an anime that ran from August 2020 to September 2020. Also based in the Bleach universe, Burn the Witch has a loyal fan base that endured years of wait, and while new chapters of the manga have been announced, this new season of the anime will surely make the wait worth it. Burn the Witch #0.8 will be available for viewing on December 29, 2023, and although the streaming platform hasn&#39;t been announced, it will most likely be on Crunchyroll as the first season is also available there.




The announcement came much sooner than expected, but fans aren&#39;t complaining. Tite Kubo has been hard at work supervising the latest season of Bleach Thousand Year Blood War which featured some amazing anime-exclusive scenes. Now that he is free, he can focus on supervising the Burn The Witch project and make it even better than the source material. Fans of Tite Kubo and his works can really say that 2023 has been a great year, and they will see it off with a bang with the release of Burn the Witch #0.8.
