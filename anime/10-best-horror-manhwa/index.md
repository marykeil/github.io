## Literature Review

From disturbing scenes of body horror to thought-provoking situations typical of psychological horror, the manhwa medium has all kinds of stories.





Horror, as a genre, will always be subjective, with some fans admiring the truly disturbing and discomforting gore scenes that are common therein, while others may prefer the surreal and hopeless situations that protagonists often find themselves in. Regardless of the preferred type of horror though, whether it&#39;s body or psychological horror, these titles are sure to match the needs of fans of the genre.









 








 10  Tales of the Unusual 
        

Tales of the Unusual represents the quintessential horror manhwa, a collection of various short stories, each with different twists and concepts. Due to its considerable length and variety of stories included, it is only natural that not every reader may connect with each chapter equally, but there is bound to be something interesting and enjoyable for any fan of the genre. While mostly episodic in nature, the stories are occasionally related to each other, making the overall experience feel that much more cohesive and well-executed. Overall, this is certainly a great title for anyone looking for disturbing and thought-provoking ideas.





 9  Surviving Romance 
        

Isekai manhwa are not uncommon, with there being multiple great examples of titles wherein the protagonist ends up living in the world of a romance novel or game. However, these titles are typically on the more positive side, allowing their leading characters to find the perfect romance they never could have otherwise, even at the cost of certain sacrifices and troubles along the way. Surviving Romance takes a drastic shift by switching up the initial storyline, forcing protagonist Chaerin Eun to adapt to a world unlike the one she was familiar with, wherein survival and the expected happy ending are not guaranteed.





 8  Distant Sky 
        

Distant Sky is a title with a unique premise and deeply horrifying scenes, wherein a boy wakes up in a seemingly dead city. Gangnam is now devoid of life, with electricity, lights, and stars in the sky all gone, and dead people now being a common sight. While tense enough as-is, the situation is only further complicated by the involvement of a cult making this apocalyptic world increasingly hopeless. The characters are also intriguing and realistic, with their behavior matching their circumstances. Finally, the art style perfectly complements the dark story, always evoking the right feelings.





 7  Ghost Teller 
        

While ghost stories are not uncommon among horror manhwa, with other titles focusing on such urban legends and terrifying myths, Ghost Teller takes a unique approach by telling the stories from the perspective of ghosts, often about humans instead. By doing this, it manages to explore an idea that isn&#39;t as often discussed - just how far humans will go to achieve their desires and follow their emotions. It&#39;s easy to be scared by ghosts haunting people and creating supernatural events, but this work proves that humans can be just as terrifying, sometimes going to any lengths and resorting to any methods, no matter how gruesome they may be.





 6  Winter Woods 
        

Often compared to the classic Frankenstein, Winter Woods&#39; eponymous protagonist is an alchemist&#39;s experiment who, despite having lived for thousands of years, spent most of his life in captivity and isolation, never having the chance to truly develop and learn about human emotions. He somehow ends up living with Jane Reina, an aspiring writer who teaches him all about humanity, with its perks and imperfections, by using herself as an example. While the horror idea mostly comes from Winter&#39;s twisted being as a combination of dead people&#39;s body parts, the story takes a romantic approach, focusing on the development and interactions of the main characters.





 5  Sweet Home 
        

After losing his family in a tragic car accident, Cha Hyun moves into a new apartment by himself. Adjusting to his new environment and life would be difficult enough under normal circumstances, but he soon finds out that his situation is anything but normal. The people around him begin turning into scary monsters intent on exterminating humanity, and he must fight alongside other tenants to learn the truth and survive in a dark and dangerous world. Sweet Home features not only a compelling story but also a brilliant art style with unique character designs that create genuine suspense and fear among readers.





 4  Shotgun Boy 
        

The title Shotgun Boy refers to Gyuhwan Han, a boy who, after being chased into the woods by bullies, comes across a fully loaded shotgun. Upon returning, he finds that his classmates have been attacked by brain-eating monsters, and realizes that he now represents their only chance of survival. As the prequel of Sweet Home, Shotgun Boy may not be nearly as polished or well-developed, but it certainly proves that the authors had a lot of promise and inspiration from the beginning. The simple yet suitable art style and engaging story make for a thoroughly enjoyable dark experience from start to finish.





 3  Pigpen 
        

Pigpen follows amnesiac Jin-Hyeok Song, who wakes up on a magnificent beach without any memory of his past. Soon coming across the family who lives there, he may expect this to be a peaceful and relaxing getaway, but the truth is much more horrifying than that. Every member of this family has their own issues and desires, and every moment spent here is a tense one. Pigpen excels not only through its exceptionally expressive art style, which fully immerses readers but also through its original and thought-provoking twisted narrative, which is sure to provide memorable dark moments for fans of horror titles.





 2  The Tarot Café 
        

The Tarot Café refers to the café owned by the protagonist Pamela, a tarot card reader who accepts and serves supernatural beings after midnight. Whether these encounters are magical or creepy depends on the client, as her clientele tends to be rather varied. From a vampire running away from his lover, to a magician who creates a humanoid doll, she will talk with anyone who is looking to have their fortune told. The settings also vary significantly, but they are all beautifully drawn nonetheless. While not every character may be fully developed, all of them are interesting in their own ways, and the scary ones are particularly memorable.





 1  Bastard 
        

Bastard revolves around Jin Seon and his terrible twisted life. Not only is he bullied at school due to his quiet nature, but he also has to witness and participate in horrifying events at home. As far as most can tell, his father would be considered a successful and charismatic businessman, but all of that is just a facade behind which lies a deviant serial killer, whom Jin has no choice but to secretly help. However, when the next target ends up being his girlfriend, Jin finally has the chance to defy his father. Successfully combining horror with romance elements, Bastard is truly one of the best manhwa titles.
From grounded and realistic stories of protagonists who find themselves in unusually discomforting circumstances, to supernatural ones that involve ghosts and monsters threatening the peace of the world, the entries on this list prove just how varied horror can be. The concept of tense and hopeless situations can be depicted in a myriad of ways, and witnessing how characters react and change in such environments is always insightful. For anyone who enjoys being frightened, these are some of the best horror manhwa stories that are sure to provide the right level of fear.
