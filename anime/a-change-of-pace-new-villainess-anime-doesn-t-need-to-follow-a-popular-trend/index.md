# A Change of Pace - New Villainess Anime Doesn t Need to Follow a Popular Trend


## SUMMARY 



  7th Time Loop offers a fresh twist on the traditional villainess story, allowing both avid fans and those seeking something new to enjoy.   Rishe, the protagonist, may not be isekai&#39;d from the real world, but she possesses the same knowledge and experiences as other villainess characters.   Despite the unconventional nature of the series, it still falls within the villainess isekai genre, albeit with a unique and interesting story.

## Literature Review

7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy! functions and feels like a traditional villainess Isekai but isn&#39;t.





Warning: Spoilers for 7th Time Loop!!






7th Time Loop is an adaptation of the light novel series by Touko Amekawa.




The new Crunchyroll series 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy! might seem like it would be a conventional villainess isekai just because anything involving a villainess implies such a direction. Even though it&#39;s not, 7th Time Loop ironically not only functions but feels like a traditional villainess story. As a result, voracious fans of this popular trope can still enjoy what they love about them and those who want something fresh can appreciate the fun twist it provides.

An adaptation of the light novel series by Touko Amekawa, this anime can essentially be defined as Re:Zero with a villainess twist â€“ minus the isekai. That&#39;s because Rishe is a woman from the fantasy world where the series takes place and is caught in a time loop that sends her back to the same place in time every time she dies.




          

Even though Rishe isn&#39;t a girl from the real-world who gets isekai&#39;d into an otome game or romance novel, she is still equipped with the same knowledge that most villainess protagonists have. However, instead of knowing what will likely happen because she&#39;s read the novel or played the game in real life, it&#39;s because she keeps reliving the same life. This unique situation therefore allows Rishe to gain traction in her seventh and current time loop when she is proposed to by the man who indirectly killed her the first five times and who literally stabbed her during her sixth life.

Of course, even though Rishe is not the product of a game or novel, she still shares many of the same qualities of a fictional villainess. They almost always get their impending engagement annulled during a humiliating public spectacle, causing them to spiral until they embrace a life of villainy. As a result, the villainess is completely misunderstood, even though they espouse the villainess&#39; persona so well. All this actually happens to Rishe. In fact, she keeps getting reborn at the moment her engagement gets annulled in front of everyone. Moreover, she has clearly been framed for crimes she didn&#39;t commit, which clearly falls under the &#34;villainess is misunderstood&#34; category.

Most importantly, the stereotypical villainess either dies or experiences tragic losses by either the end of the game or novel, or much worse, somewhere in the middle. It therefore becomes the goal of either the isekai&#39;d villainess to save themselves, or the isekai&#39;d heroine, who knows the truth about the villainess, to restore their good name. Hilariously, Rishe is experiencing a similar deterministic phenomenon. No matter what she does in each of her six lives, she always gets swept up in a war and dies. This seventh loop, however, appears to be the most promising, since the man who&#39;s the cause of these wars is ostensibly now in the palm of Rishe&#39;s hand. This is very similar to the more conventional Crunchyroll series I&#39;m the Villainess So I&#39;m Taming the Final Boss.




          

Of course, many fans will rightfully point out that this new Crunchyroll series is literally a villainess isekai since Rishe is a villainess who keeps getting reborn, seeing as reincarnation is a major trope of the overall genre. However, since Rishe is reborn as herself instead of a real-life person getting reincarnated as a character from a novel or otome game, 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy! can safely be interpreted as an unconventional villainess anime.

7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy! is available on Crunchyroll
