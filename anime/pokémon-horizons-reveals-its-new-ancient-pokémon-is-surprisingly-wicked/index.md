## Literature Review

Lapras has a reputation as a kind and gentle Pokémon, but the Ancient Adventurer&#39;s Lapras has proven it has a completely different personality.




Warning: Spoilers for Pokémon Horizons Episode #32Pokémon Horizons has returned to its main story by tracking down the Ancient Adventurer Lucius&#39;s Lapras, but the reality of this Lapras is quite different from the elegant and gentle appearance that the Pokémon is widely known for. In fact, this Lapras was actually caught pulling a scam, in a strange case of Pokémon behaving badly.




After hearing of a cargo ship which was rescued from sudden heavy fog by a Lapras, the Rising Volt Tacklers set off in their airship for the region of ocean where Lapras was allegedly sighted. They touched the airship down in the water and began sailing through the area until the fog descended upon them as well. Liko and Roy, out on the deck, discover that two Pokémon, a Toedscruel and an Ambipom, managed to board the ship in the fog and steal the berries that Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly were eating.

          

The Pokémon fought back briefly, but eventually fled as the ship left the fog altogether. That left a big question, though: where did these land-based Pokémon come from?

Friede becomes suspicious upon hearing the story from Liko and Roy, and has the crew move boxes of berries up to the deck as they try to pass through the fog again. Sure enough, the Pokémon from before board the ship again and start stealing berry boxes, but Friede then activates his plan. Using Captain Pikachu&#39;s Rising Volt Tackle to clear the fog away, he reveals a scarred Wailord with several Pokémon standing atop it alongside their ship. It turns out that the mist was actually created by Lapras to provide cover for the Pokémon pirates, who would go on to steal the entire cargo of any ship that passed by.

It&#39;s an extremely sophisticated plan for a group of Pokémon to come up with, although the episode does make a point of reminding fans how intelligent Lapras are supposed to be. Perhaps the most impressive part is that Lapras is aware of its reputation, and was able to use that to cover up what it was actually doing, because people have such an inherent desire to trust Lapras. While the plan itself is quite a clever scheme, there isn&#39;t yet any indication as to what Lapras&#39;s motive is in all this. It&#39;s possible Lapras is simply trying to help this group of stranded Pokémon to survive, and that its motive isn&#39;t as evil as it appears to be.

Of course, it&#39;s also possible that Lapras simply enjoys pulling off schemes like this, since little of its personality was revealed in the episode. Groups of wild Pokémon have certainly pulled off coordinated action before, such as in the episode &#34;Pirates of Decolore!&#34;. Still, such a thing is pretty rare, and few schemes have had a mastermind as intelligent as Lapras behind the scenes. What drove one of the Pokémon of the strongest trainer in history to a life of piracy after all these years is certainly an interesting question, but only the next episode of Pokémon Horizons can provide the answer.
