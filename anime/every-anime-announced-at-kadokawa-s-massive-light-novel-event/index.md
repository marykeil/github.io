## Literature Review

Sneaker Bunko&#39;s 35 year anniversary provided an opportunity to announce a slew of future adaptations, including a few highly-anticipated titles.





The anniversary stream showed a variety of isekai fantasy series and high school romantic comedies would be hitting screens in the future. Given the current popularity of both genres, it&#39;s natural to see more of such stories on the horizon. Judging by the released material, fans can expect KonoSuba, Banished From the Heroes&#39; Party and Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian to arrive first.

 Sneaker Bunko Bets Big On Rom-Com And Isekai As Trending Genres 

 

As reported by Anime New Network, Sneaker Bunko&#39;s Sunday event revealed that the following titles would be given the screen treatment:

  KonoSuba Season 3 (2024)   Banished From the Heroes&#39; Party Season 2 (January 2024)   Magical Explorer   The World&#39;s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in a Different World as an Aristocrat Season 2   The Insipid Prince&#39;s Furtive Grab for The Throne   Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian   The Neat and Beautiful Girl at My New School Was My Childhood Friend Whom I Thought Was a Boy and I Played Together With   I Became Friends With the Second Cutest Girl in Class  

Magical Explorer and Insipid Prince are the only new fantasy series on the list. The former is an isekai into a video game world, with the twist that the arriving protagonist finds himself taking the role of the hapless comic relief sidekick, rather than the overpowered hero he had hoped for. Insipid Prince, meanwhile, portrays the complete opposite story about a more powerful but less popular royal sibling who decides to work incognito as an adventurer to support his brother&#39;s rule from the shadows.




Of these announcements, KonoSuba and Banished From the Heroes&#39; Party received full promotional trailers, complete with estimated premiere dates, while Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian showed off its key visuals and staff information, such as how the studio Doga Kobo would be handling the anime. Besides the former two arriving next year, this also gives strong indications that Alya will likely also appear later in 2024, while the rest of the announced shows will likely take much longer. Another highlight of the event was the reveal that the Haruhi Suzumiya novel series would be receiving a new volume.

          

The selection offered by Sneaker Bunko is all fantasy and student rom-coms. Furthermore, Insipid Prince is the only non-isekai fantasy of the lot. It only goes to show how popular it has been to adapt either genre, despite some criticism about any over-saturation in the market. Clearly, the limit has yet to be reached if Kadokawa believes there is still room for more. For the immediate future, they will remain fixtures in the anime landscape. Still, KonoSuba has plenty of fans for its slapstick comedy, and if any anime deserved a return to form, it would be this one.
