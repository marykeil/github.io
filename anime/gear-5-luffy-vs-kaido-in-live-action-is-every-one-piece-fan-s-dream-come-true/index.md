## Literature Review

Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 battle against Kaido in One Piece has been translated to live-action by an enthusiastic fan, and it looks absolutely incredible.




One Piece&#39;s reveal of Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 during his battle with Kaido was a massive moment, and now a fan has immortalized that in a new live-action video. With the announcement of Netflix&#39;s One Piece being renewed for season 2, fans were hopeful that some of One Piece&#39;s best moments would be adapted. While that series might take a decade to reach Luffy and Kaido&#39;s last brawl, one talented fan couldn&#39;t wait for the moment to be brought to life, and took it upon themselves to create something that can only be described as a masterpiece.




An avid One Piece fan, X user JalexRosa spent more than 100 days creating a one-minute live-action version of the iconic final fight between Luffy and Kaido. The video perfectly captured how menacing and scary Kaido would look in real life.


 

The setting was also accurate, in a damaged battlefield on top of Onigashima on a full moon. His choice of capturing the moment when Luffy transformed into Gear 5 was a brilliant decision, as that is the most iconic moment in the fight. The cartoonish style of the transformation was also on point.

                  One Of The Straw Hats Has One Piece&#39;s Saddest Backstory, And It&#39;s Not Robin   While One Piece fans usually look at Robin&#39;s tragic past as the saddest backstory in the series, another Straw Hat has her beaten in that regard.   





 Fanmade Live-Action Luffy Vs. Kaido Short Surpasses All Expectations 

 

Artist JalexRosa documented every step of the process in a video they posted on their Youtube channel, allowing viewers to fully appreciate the incredible amount of time and effort involved. From recording and editing footage to mastering 3D animation techniques to adding vivid and vibrant effects, to seamlessly incorporating music and sound, the artist&#39;s range of skills and talents are nothing short of extraordinary. Videography, sound design, and animation came together under one person to produce an end result that is a stunning masterpiece.

                  Retro Review: One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc Took The Series To Unprecedented Heights   From emotional flashbacks to shocking revelations and stunning action scenes, the Wano Arc is the pinnacle of One Piece&#39;s storytelling and animation.   




The Wano arc of One Piece showcased a thrilling fight between Luffy and Kaido which is widely considered to be the best in the entire series. The animation during this fight was truly spectacular, capturing the intense emotions present as Luffy fought for his friends. The introduction of Gear 5, a hyped yet simplistic transformation, sent the internet into a frenzy. Its relative ease of adaptation for a live-action version would make it a great choice, compared to other more complex transformations. In fact, a fan-made video demonstrates how Netflix, with its vast resources, could create an even more exceptional version of this epic fight scene.

Between the manga, the anime, and now the Netflix adaptation, One Piece is showing no signs of slowing down. Luffy and Kaido&#39;s fight has already become one of the most iconic moments in the series despite being so recent. Given this, it only makes sense that talented fans like Jalex Rosa would devote time to recreating the massive battle that gave fans Gear 5. JalexRosa&#39;s Luffy Vs. Kaido fight shows exactly how One Piece&#39;s live-action adaptation should handle the peak of Luffy&#39;s character.
