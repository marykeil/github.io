## Literature Review

While many romance anime use Christmas-themed episodes as adorable filler content, Toradora subverted this expectation in a big way.




Christmas-themed episodes in romance anime aren&#39;t rare by any means; however, for many series, the gift-giving holiday is often used as an adorable filler device. One episode from Toradora!, a beloved classic from the 2010s, flipped this idea on its head by making its own Christmas episode, &#34;Christmas Eve Festival&#34;, one of the most impactful in the series. Placed near the climax of the story, &#34;Christmas Eve Festival&#34; is centered on the Christmas party being held at their school. After being pushed by Taiga to invite then-love interest Minori, he gets dressed up and pairs off with Taiga to attend the party. Once they arrive, Ryuuji quickly loses sight of Taiga after being sent to run the drink station.




In a fan-service fueled surprise, Taiga and Ami then perform a light-hearted Christmas song. Shortly after their performance, Taiga vanishes from the party – and Ryuuji is left asking around to see what&#39;s happened to her. He&#39;s then told by Ami that Taiga left to convince Minori to attend the event before scolding him for playing house, and for dealing with the consequences of his actions that he, up to this point, was completely blind to.

          

In a whirlwind of events that follow, Minori ultimately does return to the party to reject Ryuuji with a callback to an earlier episode, stating that she doesn&#39;t think that she needs to see UFOs or ghosts. The confrontation leaves Ryuuji confused and hurt, but the narrative hints and visual cues dropped throughout the event tell fans everything they need to know leading into the anime&#39;s final episodes.





 Toradora&#39;s Christmas Episode Is One of the Series&#39; Most Important By Design 
Created by J.C. Staff, based on the original light novels by Yuyuko Takemiya and Yasu
         

Toradora! turned what could have been a fun, light fan-service moment into an episode that culminated the character arcs of its main love triangle as the anime began marching into its final batch of episodes. Up until this point in the anime, Taiga had been helping Ryuuji with getting Minori to fall for him – something that the entire premise of the show was built around. In that time, the pair had grown so comfortable with one another that they were near inseparable, something that came to a head as Taiga came to the realization that she had romantic feelings for the stony Ryuuji. This episode also revealed that the pair&#39;s efforts weren&#39;t in vain, and that Minori very much had feelings for Ryuuji, too.

Instead of making a gag out of the circumstances, or making things over-complicated by introducing a series of misunderstandings that are more than common in romance anime, Toradora! chose to tackle the more realistic, raw, and gut-wrenching emotions that a situation like this can create. As Taiga decides to back down, giving Ryuuji the opportunity to make things official with Minori after 19 episodes of pursuing her, she settles in at home to wait for Santa as her feelings of loneliness begin to consume her. One of the key components of Taiga&#39;s character and her off-putting attitude is that she struggles with connecting to others, partially due to her strained relationship with her parents; a loneliness that&#39;s perfectly illustrated by her choosing to wait home alone for something that she knows doesn&#39;t actually exist.




          

In a Christmas miracle of sorts, Ryuuji appears at her window – albeit, not as himself, but dressed in a bulky mascot suit of Santa Claus – to surprise her. This tender moment takes place directly before Minori rejects him, and the story begins to drop hints that the level of devotion and dedication that Ryuuji has towards making Taiga happy may not be entirely platonic, even if he doesn&#39;t realize it quite yet. After checking in on her and making sure that she&#39;s okay, Taiga has to physically – and metaphorically – push Ryuuji away to make sure that he returns to the party to see Minori, ultimately leading to him being rejected.

This moment, in what initially appeared to be an easy-going Christmas-themed episode, does an excellent job at showing just how high the tension has built between these three characters. In the end, Ryuuji is left on the ground feeling what he believes to be heartbreak, Minori trying to find acceptance after pushing her own feelings to the side for Taiga, and with Taiga sobbing, alone at home, believing that her fun-filled days with Ryuuji are coming to an end. Toradora! is far from being the perfect romance anime, but what the series managed to accomplish with its Christmas episode has left a lasting mark on the anime community, and is proof that the series deserves its title as a classic.
