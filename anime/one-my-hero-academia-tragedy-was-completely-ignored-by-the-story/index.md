# One My Hero Academia Tragedy Was Completely Ignored By The Story


## SUMMARY 



  Camie&#39;s abduction by the League of Villains initially went unnoticed and was later covered up by Shiketsu High School.   Camie&#39;s kidnapping going public would&#39;ve allowed the League of Villains to further erode faith in heroes and potentially even shut down the hero schools.   The impact of Camie&#39;s abduction led to increased awareness of Toga&#39;s threat and measures to prevent future disguises, benefiting the hero schools during the evacuation.

## Literature Review

Bakugo wasn&#39;t the only student seemingly kidnapped by the League of Villains, but for some reason this missing student was glossed over.




While Bakugo&#39;s kidnapping in My Hero Academia was a major news event, another student who was seemingly taken by the League of Villains, just like Bakugo, went almost completely unnoticed. This student is none other than Camie Utsushimi, the girl who Himiko Toga impersonated during the Provisional Licensing Exam arc.




Camie is a student of Shiketsu High School, U.A.&#39;s rival to the west, and was supposed to participate in the Licensing Exam until something happened, and she was replaced by Toga before ever even appearing on-screen. The real Camie doesn&#39;t actually show up until the remedial course arc, almost 50 chapters later. Shiketsu didn&#39;t even suspect Camie had been replaced until after the real Camie came back to them with memory loss of around four days, and indications that she had been drugged. While it isn&#39;t known exactly what happened to Camie as a result, the implication seems to be that she was taken by the League and kept drugged until Toga returned, at which time she was randomly dumped back out on the streets.


 Camie&#39;s Abduction Was Covered Up by Shiketsu 
          

While Bakugo&#39;s kidnapping received a lot of press, and U.A. was forced to announce that it had occurred, there&#39;s no indication that Shiketsu ever had to own up to what happened with Camie. That suggests that the school went out of its way to keep it quiet, and it&#39;s understandable why they might try to do that given the fallout of Bakugo&#39;s kidnapping. Since Camie&#39;s absence was only noticed after she returned, it seems likely there was a desire to sweep it under the rug, with the only apparent acknowledgment being Camie&#39;s presence at the remedial course, since she effectively missed the Licensing Exam entirely.




As far as the story is concerned, it&#39;s a bit of a shame that what happened with Camie wasn&#39;t more widely known. It would&#39;ve served the League of Villains&#39; agenda well, further eroding faith in the heroes and their capacity to protect people, as well as causing people to mistrust the hero schools. This event becoming public may even have resulted in the hero schools being temporarily shut down, especially since it followed so closely after the Bakugo incident. Of course, without the hero students available to help them, the pro heroes would be in dire straits as well, now far more outnumbered by villains, which would only get worse after the jailbreaks.

Camie&#39;s kidnapping is very much glossed over in the My Hero Academia manga and anime, but it did have a longer-lasting impact. The hero schools such as U.A. became more aware of what a threat Toga&#39;s Quirk could be, and took measures to ensure that Toga wouldn&#39;t be able to infiltrate their ranks in disguise once again. These measures ended up being very helpful in the post-Paranormal Liberation War story arcs, when the schools became evacuation shelters for civilians. Despite this, the fact that Camie&#39;s abduction was so quickly concealed certainly doesn&#39;t portray the heroes in a great light, and it may be one of My Hero Academia&#39;s biggest missed moments.
