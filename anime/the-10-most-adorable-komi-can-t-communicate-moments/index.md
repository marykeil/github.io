## Literature Review

Komi Can&#39;t Communicate is an anime that&#39;s filled with adorable moments. Here are the ten best parts that show Komi at her absolute cutest.





What makes Komi Can&#39;t Communicate interesting though is how it explores Komi&#39;s path to 100 friends. Rather than having a straightforward narrative, it shows snapshots of her life through chapters to give it a slice-of-life feel. This structure has helped the series naturally show the progression of Komi&#39;s social skills and produced some incredibly cute moments along the way. Without further ado, here are the ten most adorable moments to be found throughout Komi Can&#39;t Communicate.

 10  Komi Gets Shaved Ice With Her Father 
        

In a clever display of non-verbal communication, this brief story shows Komi and her dad having a Father/Daughter day at a shaved ice store. There, the two silently communicate with one another about how Komi&#39;s school life is going. There are humorous moments where Komi kids with her dad and cherishable moments where she grows respect for her father. It&#39;s an adorable moment that gives fans so much with so little as it reveals that Komi&#39;s struggles with communication come from her father&#39;s side, but she&#39;s learned how to accept it through him as well.





 9  Komi Goes to a Cat Café 
        

In this episode, Komi goes with her friends to a cat café so she can pet her favorite animals. However, Komi&#39;s social anxiety scares the cats off, upsetting her. Luckily, a big black cat named Chocolat senses her being upset and actually comes to her. This brief moment where Komi finally gets to be with cats is one of the best moments of the whole show. Cats play a huge part in Komi Can&#39;t Communicate as she has cat ears pop up whenever she&#39;s happy. Seeing Komi finally get to be with one and actually go back occasionally to see Chocolat is absolutely adorable.





 8  Komi Makes Her First Phone Call (Accidentally) 
        

In a continuation of an earlier story where she asks for her friends&#39; phone numbers, Komi spends an evening at home entranced by her new cell phone. She has an adorable moment where she practices having all the conversations she&#39;ll have as she gets better at talking to others. However, she unwittingly activates her phone&#39;s feature of dialing by holding it up to her ear and calls Tadano by mistake. Hearing Komi&#39;s voice as she tries to explain calling Tadano by mistake is a nice moment with a tremendous payoff. Not only is Tadano proud of her for trying (even by accident), but Komi&#39;s reaction to holding one of her first phone calls is one of the sweetest scenes in the whole show, especially knowing later down the line her true feelings for him.





 7  Komi Cheers Up a Baby 
        

On one of Komi&#39;s solo adventures, she takes a trip to the library to check out a book. However, she accidentally scares a baby without meaning to because of her stare when trying to smile at them. What&#39;s sweet about this moment though is that she doesn&#39;t run away. In fact, she tries to correct it. Komi actually makes herself smile with her fingers to help cheer up the baby, which ends up being successful as they smile and laugh. It&#39;s a brief but adorable moment that shows Komi&#39;s growth as a character as she practices communicating in her own way without the need for support from Tadano and her friends, even when Tadano saw everything without her noticing on his way to return books to the library.

The Netflix anime Komi Can&#39;t Communicate tries and succeeds at balancing heartfelt drama and humorous dialogues with each and every episode. 








 6  Komi Reacts to Maid Tadano 
        

During the culture festival, Komi&#39;s class decides to make their exhibit a maid café with Komi as one of the workers. However, what earns the spot on this list is her reaction when Tadano emerges dressed as a maid himself after being pressured by Najimi. She&#39;s awestruck by how adorable he looks and even tells him herself later in the day. Given Komi later develops a crush on Tadano, this small moment where she can&#39;t resist his adorable new look shows just why fans began to love Komi as a character. Whenever she&#39;s happy, her reactions are just too cute for words and this is perhaps the best example of it.





 5  Komi Gets a Cat Keychain 
        

While the topic of this entry may seem a bit small, the story behind Komi getting the keychain is one of the series&#39; finest moments. When Komi goes with her friends to an arcade, Tadano discovers there&#39;s a cat keychain in a claw game that he knows Komi would want. To surprise her, Tadano wins it for her and brings it to her at school as a gift. To his surprise, it turns out she already has one. However, she exchanges it for Tadano&#39;s because it&#39;s a black cat: her favorite. Before the episode ends, Komi is shown at home clutching her new keychain from Tadano tightly in an adorable moment that shows her bond and feelings with Tadano growing closer.





 4  Komi Gives Tadano Valentine&#39;s Chocolates 
        

This was a big moment for fans of the relationship developing between Komi and Tadano, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. To celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day, Komi takes part in an annual tradition most girls in her class do by making &#34;Friendship Chocolates&#34; for her friends. However, Tadano notices that she&#39;s given some to everyone but him. Later that night though, Komi finds Tadano while he&#39;s going out and gives him his chocolates. In a shocking romantic move, Komi even tells him that they&#39;re the best chocolates out of the set she made, signifying that she saved them specifically for him. This was a landmark moment in the series that not only showed how much she cherished Tadano but also handled it in such an adorable way.





 3  Komi Goes to the Park 
        

A fairly brief moment of joy for Komi undoubtedly makes this one of the most memorable moments of the show. This short segment shows Komi going to a park as she swings on the swings and rides down the slide. It&#39;s another example of the series&#39; slice-of-life set-up, and it works in this sense because seeing Komi at peace and happy is when she&#39;s at her most wholesome and adorable. The way her face lights up when she&#39;s having fun without anyone around is enough to make anyone smile, even Tadano who spots her afar for a brief second while once again trying to return his library books.





 2  Komi&#39;s Secret Festival Message 
        

During a summer festival, Komi goes with Tadano and Najimi to play the games and see different stands. However, without something to write on to communicate, Tadano offers to help her. By the end of their adventure though, Komi and Tadano share a brief moment alone. She compliments his look and the two enjoy each other&#39;s company. However, what Tadano doesn&#39;t see is a message Komi writes on the ground where she says that she enjoyed spending time alone with him most of all. This is a sweet moment early in the series that hints Komi is developing a longing for a relationship with Tadano, and the fact she wipes it away before he can see it is an adorable way of showing she wants to keep this thought to herself for the time being.





 1  Komi Talks to Tadano 
        

Before their big school trip, Tadano notices that Komi is more anxious than usual. When he asks her why she&#39;s upset, she shrugs it off and heads home. However, once she turns a corner, she calls Tadano and explains everything to him over the phone. This is a major breakthrough for Komi&#39;s character as she&#39;s able to speak with him without fear. The whole series had built up to this moment where she&#39;s so comfortable with Tadano that she can finally tell him anything without the need for other communication methods. Even though she&#39;s not quite ready to talk to him face-to-face, it&#39;s a huge moment for her.
Komi&#39;s first major speaking moment with Tadano easily makes it the most adorable moment in Komi Can&#39;t Communicate as it best displays Komi&#39;s character development and the sweet relationship she has with the boy who promised to help make her dream of making 100 friends come true. Overall, Komi Can&#39;t Communicate is a series built around wholesome, adorable moments where the protagonist is able to overcome her anxiety, even briefly, and progresses toward her goals, while leaving fans with uplifting feelings.
