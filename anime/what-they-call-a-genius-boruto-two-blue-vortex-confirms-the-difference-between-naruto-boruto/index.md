## Literature Review

Despite being blood-related, Boruto and Naruto have always been different but the latest chapter of Boruto shows how much.




It has always been a well-known fact within the Naruto community that Naruto and Boruto are as different as night and day. However, the latest chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex shows just how the father and son are different.




One of the most interesting parts of the chapter was Sasuke and Boruto&#39;s training. Chapter #5 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex started off by diving into the time skip and revealing what the two were up to. Although it wasn&#39;t as eye-catching as the rest of the chapter, there was a hidden detail in Boruto&#39;s training.

          

Boruto managed to learn most of Sasuke&#39;s techniques in under a year, proving how talented he really is and how different he is from Naruto, who had always struggled with ninjutsu.

                  Boruto&#39;s Real Teacher During The Time Skip Explains Why He&#39;s So Powerful Now   Boruto’s return to Konoha has shown him to be a much-improved shinobi, and this is due to his work under his father’s trainer - well sort of.   


 Sasuke Declares Boruto a Natural Genius, Setting Him Apart From Naruto 
          




The latest chapter of the manga was explosive, setting up the goals for Boruto&#39;s new villains and clearing up the air about some of the mysteries, particularly those that happened while Boruto was away. The chapter saw Naruto being brought back into the story once again, making him relevant and hopefully making an appearance in the future. With so much going on, it was easy to dismiss Boruto&#39;s incredible achievement that put him in the leagues of geniuses such as Itachi and Minato.

Sasuke is one of the most accomplished ninjas of all time, wielding so many techniques that make his arsenal one of the largest. From sword fighting, and mastery of the Fire and Lightning styles to the use of the Sharingan, he has powers to counter most opponents. That is why it is so impressive that the 13-year-old Boruto grasped his techniques and made them his own within a year. This is a huge contrast to his father, who had to rely much more on hard work than any innate talent.

          




That happened in the first year of the time skip, and 2 more years is surely enough to fully master Sasuke&#39;s techniques for someone as gifted as Boruto. He didn&#39;t stop there, however, as he went on to learn Minato&#39;s Flying Raijin Jutsu, used Jiraiya&#39;s Toads for spying, and took the Rasengan to a whole new level. Coupled with the fact that he can use Karma to significantly enhance all his techniques and body, Boruto could very well be the strongest ninja in history, surpassing his father. With the plot of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex heating up with the introduction of new villains, Boruto&#39;s full extent of his strength will surely be one to behold.
