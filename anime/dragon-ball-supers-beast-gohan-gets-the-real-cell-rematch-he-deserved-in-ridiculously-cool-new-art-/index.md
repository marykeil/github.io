## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero saw Beast Gohan and Cell Max go at it in an epic final brawl, with new fanart giving them the real rematch they deserve.




Dragon Ball Super’s 2022 movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, proved to be an epic anime event that saw Gohan ascend to a new level of power with his newly acquired Beast form. And although Gohan was able to defeat an oversized version of Cell before the film was over, it wasn’t the rematch fans necessarily wanted, with this piece of fanart delivering the kind of fight the pair always deserved.




Recently shared on X by username @DBSKAKERU1, this isn’t the first time this talented artist has impressed their almost 95k followers with a piece of Dragon Ball fanart that looks like it came directly from series creator Akira Toriyama himself.


 

Having produced similarly stunning works that step outside of established Dragon Ball canon to give fans something truly unique, @DBSKAKERU1 has drawn Trunks as the King of the Saiyans, Gohan going Super Saiyan in his Supreme Kai outfit, Chi-Chi returning to her fighter roots, and even a new version of Goku using his Ultra Instinct technique, all to stellar results.

                  Future Trunks Finally Avenges Gohan In Badass New Dragon Ball Fanart   Dragon Ball&#39;s future has Trunks fighting for his life against the evil Androids 17 and 18, with new fanart showing Trunks triumphant in his revenge.   





 Beast Gohan Fights Perfect Cell Max In A Fanart Rematch For The Ages 
          

A fight that came about after Cell Max was woken by a resurgent Red Ribbon Army, leading to Gohan going Beast mode after thinking Piccolo was killed, this battle quickly became a stand-out sequence even with the initial disappointment of Cell Max’s character design being a gigantic red version of his hulking second form. More a mindless monster than the clever and ruthless “perfect” version of himself seen when Gohan first went Super Saiyan 2, Cell Max felt like a missed opportunity for a true rematch that would have carried far more weight both emotionally and narratively for everyone involved.

Taking advantage of this unfulfilled idea, @DBSKAKERU1 gives fans a Perfect Cell Max vs. Beast Gohan match-up that looks as if it were ripped right out of Dragon Ball Super’s manga. Colored with textured hues that make Perfect Cell Max’s red body and Beast Gohan’s silver hair pop, @DBSKAKERU1 shrinks Cell down to a reasonable size but keeps his mace-like tail, expertly showing how this form should have been designed in the movie. Staring at each other with piercing eyes, fans can feel the electricity crackle between Gohan and Cell, setting up an epic battle that, unfortunately, never happened.

So while many fans have lamented over not getting to see Beast Gohan take on Perfect Cell Max, @DBSKAKERU1 has given them a great “What If?” scenario that not only succeeds where Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero’s final battle didn’t, but thanks to @DBSKAKERU1’s impeccable artistic skills, delivers a piece of work that looks indistinguishable from official Dragon Ball art too. Gohan and Cell probably won’t get the chance to duke it out a third time in Dragon Ball Super, but if they do, @DBSKAKERU1’s art needs to be used as inspiration.
