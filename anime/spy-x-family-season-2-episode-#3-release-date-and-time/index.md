 What Happened In Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #2? 
          

Season 2, Episode #2 of Spy x Family followed Bond as he unintentionally ended up accompanying Loid on a mission while trying to avoid Yor&#39;s cooking, fearing it may kill him. Luckily for Bond, the mission is more than successful and wraps up earlier than expected, allowing Loid to make Bond a meal instead, saving him from a rather tragic fate at the hands of Yor&#39;s fatal cooking. Meanwhile, Damian enjoys a lovely, relaxing field trip with his friends disguised as a punishment by Henderson to trick Damian into taking some time off from overworking himself to earn more Stellas. The boys spend a relaxing evening with Mr. Green who teaches Damian about the need to let loose every now and then.






 Spy x Family Season 2, Episode #3 Will Shift Back To The Forgers 
          

Season 2, Episode #3 of Spy x Family is titled, &#39;Mission and Family / The Elegant Bondman / The Heart of a Child / Waking Up&#39; and suggests the episode will center around the Forgers, possibly on Anya&#39;s obsession with her favorite television hero, Bondman, and Loid&#39;s classic struggle to separate developing attachments to his fake family from Operation Strix. Regardless, Season 2 has managed to maintain the signature wholesome charm of Spy x Family, and Episode #3 is sure to be just as entertaining.

Don&#39;t miss Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #3 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 21, 2023.
