## Literature Review

Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batmanâ€™s kids finally decide on the perfect team name that eloquently sums up what the future heroes are all about.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Wonder Woman #5!The next generation of DC Comics&#39; Trinity has settled on a codename that perfectly captures their unique spirit. While Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman&#39;s respective offspring are going to forge a bond as close as their parents was, and their new name demonstrates what sets them apart from their iconic legacies.




In Wonder Woman #5&#39;s backup story &#34;World&#39;s Finest: Part 3&#34; by Tom King and Belen Ortega, Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter Trinity is competing with Batman and Superman over what to name their team. The team races kangas on Themyscira while they all mention what name they&#39;d prefer.

          

However, the race takes a turn when Trinity is bucked off of her steed. Thankfully, she&#39;s fine and the spill gives way to a moment of clarity where Trinity comes up with the name Gen-S, inspired by the Kryptonian symbol for hope. Batman and Superman agree with the codename, uniting the team.

The world was stunned when it was revealed that Wonder Woman was going to be a mother. However, Trinity, aka Elizabeth Marston Prince, has yet to be born in the modern-day DC Universe. Her appearances have largely been contained to the backups of Wonder Woman, which show her growing up alongside her closest companions, Jon and Damian. Often Trinity is getting into trouble, forcing the elder two heroes to come to her aid. But the backup stories have largely served to showcase the close relationship Superman, Trinity, and Batman are going to forge one day.

For decades, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman have been dubbed DC&#39;s Trinity due to their importance to the DCU. Elizabeth, Damian, and Jon all carry their respective parents&#39; best traits such as Diana&#39;s determination or Clark&#39;s compassion. But while they all hold the previous generations&#39; values, the new wave of heroes are their own people. They deserve a name that reflects who they are and what they&#39;re out to do. Yes, they may be a trinity, but more than anything else, this cache of heroes has come together with the idea that they can make the DC Universe a better place.

When DC fans hear the word &#39;trinity&#39;, they instantly think of DC&#39;s iconic heroes. While their kids fit the definition of the Trinity, they aren&#39;t out there to simply replace their parents. Damian, Elizabeth, and Jon want to build on what their parents did and become heroes who serve as symbols of hope to the next generation. Damian may have given Jon a lot of grief for Superman&#39;s &#39;S&#39; standing for hope, but it&#39;s an effective symbol that everyone recognizes and appreciates. With their new name, Gen-S has come together and begun shaping their destiny in the DC Universe.

Wonder Woman #5 is on sale now from DC Comics.
