## Literature Review

The first two chapters of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex have seen much action but they hint at the death of an important character.





Ever since 2017 when Boruto originally released, there have been many rumors about whether or not Sasuke and Naruto died. It&#39;s now been established that Naruto is in fact not dead, but has been sealed away, so the spotlight is now on Sasuke. The rumors do have some merit though. The first two chapters of Boruto&#39;s timeskip have small hints that allude to Sasuke&#39;s demise.




                  Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Admits Its Own Plot Holes (And Already Fixed Them)   The opening of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex attempts to explain the ramifications of the recent massive upheaval to the Boruto universe.    


 Boruto Has Inherited Sasuke&#39;s Possessions 
          

In both the beginning of the Boruto manga and anime and the chapter 1 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, Boruto is wielding Sasukeâ€™s sword. Not only that, he&#39;s also wearing his hidden leaf headband. He&#39;s also wearing a cloak, even though it doesn&#39;t belong to him, but is reminiscent of Sasuke&#39;s signature style. While still being pure speculation, it seems that Boruto has inherited his master&#39;s items after his death.

It&#39;s still unknown who could&#39;ve killed Sasuke, but there is strong suspicion that it could have been Code. After all, it&#39;s been revealed that Code was stronger than Jigen and could defeat Naruto and Sasuke without any limiters. Sasuke doesn&#39;t have his Rinnegan anymore, so if he was unfortunate enough to encounter Code, he would be easily killed.






 Code Has Been On The Hunt For Boruto And Sasuke For Years 
          

With Eida using her powers, Code now hates Boruto instead of Kawaki. He&#39;d be on the hunt for him, and this would lead him straight to Sasuke who&#39;s been accompanying Boruto. Since neither stand a chance, Sasuke would likely sacrifice himself to let Boruto escape and give him his prized possessions. In chapter 1 of Two Blue Vortex, Code reveals that he&#39;s been on the hunt for Boruto for the past two years. This confirms the possibility that he might have encountered Sasuke in this pursuit.

Although the manga has subtly been hinting at Sasuke&#39;s death, there are also inconsistencies within theory. The biggest is that Boruto had no bloodlust, nor a sense of revenge when he faced Code. In fact, he offered him a truce in exchange for Code halting his plans. Boruto looks up to Sasuke, almost revers him so if Code killed someone so precious he&#39;d be furious. For now, Sasuke&#39;s current status in Boruto is pure speculation, and until the manga confirms whether he&#39;s dead or alive, everything regarding the topic should be taken with a grain of salt.




Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is available to read on Manga Plus.
