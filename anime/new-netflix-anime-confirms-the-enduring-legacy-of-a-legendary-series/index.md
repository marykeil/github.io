## Literature Review

Astro Boy might be the granddad of all modern anime characters, but Netflix’s Pluto proves he can still capture the hearts and minds of the youth.




With the premiere of Netflix&#39;s anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Pluto, Astro Boy returns to the small screen once again, but like so many anime characters who existed before the turn of the century, there&#39;s always the question of whether it&#39;s possible to meld his traditional persona and mindset with today&#39;s sensibilities. Moreover, with so many new anime characters, there&#39;s the additional question of whether it&#39;s necessary to bring back a classic character at all. In regards Astro Boy, the answer to both questions is yes – and the anime industry is in a much better place because of it.




Since his debut in 1952, Astro Boy has always been more than a super-powered robot capable of taking down villains and evil mechs three times his size. He was also a good-natured boy who, despite being spurned by his creator, never let that insensitivity get him down personally, nor did he allow it to darken his outlook on the world.

          

Astro Boy had instant and automatic appeal to children everywhere. He was a hero who was a kid just like them – he went to school, liked to have fun, made mistakes, and was scolded by his guardians. But no matter how hard times got, Astro Boy always remained positive. As such he gave countless children hope that there’s always a brighter tomorrow. While Netflix&#39;s Pluto is primarily a psychological thriller involving Gesicht, a super-robot detective investigating the mysterious deaths of other advanced robots and humans, Astro Boy plays a key role in the story.

While Pluto is still an excellent story without any prior knowledge of Astro Boy, author Naoki Urasawa clearly wanted to introduce him to a new generation of manga fans – fans who enjoy darker, grittier stories with less overt &#34;good versus evil&#34; stories. Despite its decidedly gloomier theme, Astro Boy&#39;s original wholesome, friendly, and hopeful personality still shines through.

Netflix&#39;s Pluto builds on Urasawa&#39;s effort to keep Astro Boy relevant and introduce him to yet another generation of anime fans who&#39;ve certainly heard of him, but don&#39;t necessarily understand his legacy. Netflix&#39;s version does an even better job than Urasawa&#39;s manga in updating Astro Boy for modern audiences. He continues to have all the same attributes that have made him one of the most iconic anime characters in the world. More importantly, however, the series does an excellent job depicting the childlike qualities that have endeared him to children everywhere.

The Netflix Pluto adaptation ends with Astro Boy in a better place as a franchise in the public eye. While the character might be over 70 years old, Pluto proved he remains &#34;young at heart&#34;. In every degree, he&#39;s gotten more serious and unflinching, there&#39;s been an equal degree of humanization.

That is, despite Pluto&#39;s darkness, Astro Boy&#39;s original legacy endures. He remains just as relatable, if not more so, to everyone, but especially to children. Faced with the prospect of being hunted by an unknown assailant, Astro Boy remains positive and hopeful through it all. Thanks to Netflix&#39;s Pluto, another generation of fans will be able to enjoy the little robot boy that could.

Pluto is now streaming on Netflix.
