# New Crunchyroll Anime Tears Down Almost Every Romance Trope With One Episode


## SUMMARY 



  Our Dating Story breaks the mold of typical romance anime by subverting major tropes in its debut episode, offering a refreshing take for veteran fans.   The series stands out by allowing both the male and female lead to confess their feelings early on, providing insight into their emotions from the start.   While the show adheres to the trope of postponing a kiss until the end, the relationship between Ryuto and Runa goes beyond this goal, promising a more intimate connection.

## Literature Review

While one unbreakable trope still remains untouched, Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me&#39;s debut episode subverts the rest.

Our Dating story is streaming on Crunchyroll.




A new anime series on Crunchyroll called Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me completely subverts almost every major romance trope in anime all within the span of the first episode. Best of all, the series continues this promising trend in many of the following episodes, so veteran fans of the romance genre can expect more than just a subversive debut episode to reel them in before pandering to a slew of overused formulas.

Although Our Dating Story stars the stereotypical introverted guy with the outgoing girl, nothing else feels formulated in the episode #1 adaptation of the original light novel series, You Were Experienced, I Was Not: Our Dating Story by Makiko Nagaoka and illustrator magako. Ryuto is dared to confess his feelings to the most popular girl in school named Runa, and she, to his surprise, says yes. Moreover, Runa invites him to her house when no one in her family is home and things get a little steamy. While Ryuto plays the ubiquitous role of the inexperienced gentleman who respects the girl, he makes an uncharacteristic goal with his new girlfriend that goes well beyond the goal of &#34;confessing&#34; or &#34;kissing&#34;.

Most romance anime are lambasted for the boy and girl never confessing their true feelings for the other until the very end of the series. In many cases, the viewer is also only aware of one character&#39;s feelings and therefore forced to endure wondering about the many &#34;what ifs&#34; of the protagonist. Ryuto not only confesses to his love interest immediately, but viewers are unprecedentedly allowed to hear how Runa actually feels about Ryuto as well soon afterward. Meanwhile, the second half of the episode&#39;s focus simultaneously tears down a staple situation in most romance anime where the boy or girl&#39;s first time in the other&#39;s home is when they visit their love interest when they&#39;re sick, and usually their parents aren&#39;t there, either.




Of course, Our Dating Story has – so far – adhered to one of the genre&#39;s most unbreakable tropes, which demands that the two love birds cannot kiss until the very end of a season. Interestingly, the promise Ryuto makes with Runa by the end of episode 1 is naturally many steps beyond the stereotypical goal of kissing. Of course, the coveted kiss is still elusive and remains a highly anticipated development to hopefully one day transpire, but the prospect already feels diminished after the conversation Ryuto and Runa have – since it&#39;s about how they will consummate their relationship when the moment is right for both of them.


 

While Runa&#39;s surprising naïveté of what actually constitutes a relationship might feel like a gimmick, a later explanation not only justifies it but allows both her and Ryuto to share many firsts together despite her overall experience, especially in relation to his lack thereof. Best of all, Our Dating Story continues to subvert the many tired tropes in romance anime. The series revolutionizes how the shy one usually reacts to the prospective ubiquitous &#34;indirect kiss&#34; and upsets the classic homeroom sitting arrangement. Meanwhile, many developments that are presented as obvious conflicts end up unexpectedly becoming nothing but red herrings, and the many twists that do occur are usually quite surprising. Of course, there are still plenty of episodes that have yet to air on Crunchyroll with the possibility of introducing at least one or two clichés, but that also means there are more chances for Ryuto and Runa to actually kiss before the season finale of Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me.
