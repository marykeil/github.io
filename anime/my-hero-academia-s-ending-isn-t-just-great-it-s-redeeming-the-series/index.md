## Literature Review

My Hero Academia&#39;s Final War arc has been an exhilarating climax for the blockbuster series and has successfully redeemed the manga&#39;s reputation.




My Hero Academia&#39;s ending is proving to be a game changer, redeeming the series&#39; recent issues. Kohei Horikoshi&#39;s blockbuster manga has taken the world by storm since it began serializing in Shonen Jump in 2014. Since its release, the action shonen has spawned a successful anime adaptation with six seasons, three spin-off films, and three spin-off manga series.




However popular the series may be, My Hero Academia has been plagued with what many fans consider to be muddled writing, bringing down much of the series&#39; core narrative as the manga has progressed. 

          

 Lackluster arcs like the Deku Vigilante arc and the Traitor arc left many fans turning their back on the series, but the ongoing Final War arc – My Hero Academia&#39;s grand finale – has managed to redeem the series.


 The Ending Arc Revisits My Hero Academia&#39;s Core Themes 
          

Something crucial about My Hero Academia that has always stood out and resonated with fans of the series is its dedication to showing an empathetic and nuanced side to heroes and villains. The Final War arc brings this heartbreaking thematic back to the forefront through the fan-favorite villain, Himiko Toga. Blinded by rage and sadness for her family, the League of Villains, Toga and Ochaco face off in a ferocious battle that pushes Toga&#39;s Quirk, and her heart, past their limits.




Chapter #394 of My Hero Academia explores Toga&#39;s grief and resentment towards hero society through a gorgeously illustrated conversation between her and Ochaco, depicting the two girls as children, representative of the innocent bond shared between the pair, despite their circumstances on the battlefield. The conflict between them ultimately resolves with Himiko revealing her deepest insecurities to Ochaco, who reassures her, calling her the cutest girl in the world – ending the conflict without any violence, only pacifism and communication.



 The Final War Arc Addresses Hero Society&#39;s Biggest Issue 
          

These recent chapters of My Hero Academia continue an important narrative thread that the Deku Vigilante arc tragically failed to explore, being that hero society is inherently flawed and sets well-meaning individuals with Quirks that don&#39;t quite fit in with societal standards up to fail. In Himiko&#39;s case, her backstory reveals her community shunned her from childhood, and despite her intense want to connect and love those around her. Toga was treated as an outcast for a power that she couldn&#39;t control being born with, ultimately leading her to find a home among some of the series&#39; most deadly villains.




                  My Hero Academia Season 7 Finally Has A Release Date   The release date for My Hero Academia&#39;s seventh season has been finally officially announced.   

Chapter #395 succeeded in discussing this crucial flaw in My Hero Academia&#39;s world by proving that regardless of how much anger and bitterness Toga felt towards heroes, Ochaco&#39;s kindness helped her remember who she is at her core and that she is worthy of being loved, whether it be from her friends in the League of Villains or by making connections with heroes like Deku and Ochaco. Should My Hero Academia&#39;s Final War arc continue to explore these specific conflicts with its other villains, the series is poised to have one of the most impactful endings in Shonen Jump history.

New chapters of My Hero Academia release in English every Sunday through Viz Media&#39;s Shonen Jump app and Shueisha&#39;s Manga&#43;.
