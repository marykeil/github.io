## Literature Review

RuriDragon was a promising new Shonen Jump manga that&#39;s been on hiatus for over a year, but a recent update from the author teases an imminent return.




One of Weekly Shonen Jump’s more recent hits, RuriDragon, could be coming back sooner than fans hoped. The series has been plagued with an unfortunate string of bad luck. Despite being met with great reception from fans and critics alike, RuriDragon had to go on indefinite hiatus after just six chapters due to author Masaoki Shindo’s poor health, and for over a year, there has not been any word on when it would come back, if at all.




RuriDragon’s indefinite hiatus has been bad for fans and the series, itself, but there is finally an update about its return. In a recent post on X, RuriDragon author Masaoki Shindo said that their health was fine now and they hoped to deliver good news in 2024, which seems to be hinting that RuriDragon will resume serialization sometime in that year.


 

Naturally, there’s been no official word about RuriDragon’s return, but this is the most promising news the series has received since it went on hiatus, and with how much of a promising start RuriDragon had, that’s certainly worth getting excited about.

                  Every Manga That Left Weekly Shonen Jump In 2023   Weekly Shonen Jump is infamous for its cutthroat business practices and swift cancellations, and because of it, too many great manga ended in 2023.   





 RuriDragon Could Leave Weekly Shonen Jump 
          

With RuriDragon’s author teasing a return to serialization, something to think about is whether or not it will remain serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump going forward. While Masaoki Shindo has said that they were feeling better, the infamously grueling schedule of a weekly manga serialization could still not be good for their health, so it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility for RuriDragon to move to Shueisha&#39;s digital magazines and have a more flexible schedule like Chainsaw Man and Choujin X. Naturally, none of this will be explained until RuriDragon’s official return is announced, but it’s still something to think about, regardless.



 Why RuriDragon Was Such A Popular Shonen Jump Manga 
          




Considering RuriDragon’s possible return, it&#39;s worth discussing why it was so popular to begin with. In addition to its cute art style and interesting premise, RuriDragon won people over for how effortlessly it used fantastical elements to create a slice-of-life story that focused largely on character work without ever becoming a full-fledged comedy. That sort of urban fantasy writing that doesn’t involve fighting or romance, at least when the story first started, was rare for Weekly Shonen Jump and manga, in general, so RuriDragon immediately stood out and became popular a breakout hit among readers because of it.

                  Shonen Jump is The Best It&#39;s Been In Years: Here&#39;s Why   Shonen Jump has improved on a lot of complaints that readers have had, and its flagship series have all had incredibly exciting arcs recently.   

Naturally, RuriDragon has been met with great critical reception, as well. The 2024 edition of Kono Manga ga Sugoi!, an annual publication that ranks some of the best ongoing manga by survey, had RuriDragon tied for ninth place among men, and the fact that it ranked so highly while still on hiatus is nothing but a testament to how much it was able to endear itself to people in such a small amount of time. RuriDragon is easily one of the most promising manga to appear in Weekly Shonen Jump in recent years, and no matter the form, its eventual return to serialization will be great to see.
