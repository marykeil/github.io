## Literature Review

While many may conflate them with crime stories, yakuza anime tend to be far more interesting because of their specific sets of rules and values.




While the concept of organized crime is not uncommon in anime, stories that specifically focus on or highlight parts of yakuza culture are surprisingly rare, given how present they are in other forms of Japanese fiction, such as video games. For those looking to enjoy such stories, the best yakuza anime successfully integrate this theme into their storytelling in one way or another.
The yakuza are often conflated with the mafia, which should come as no surprise, given that they are both groups of organized crime. However, what sets these yakuza stories apart are their strict hierarchy and specific rules. Also, as the genre has reached great popularity, recent series have experimented with it, pushing the envelope and going beyond the realm of traditional crime stories.









 








 10  The Way of the Househusband 
        

The Way of the Househusband revolves around Tatsu, a former yakuza who gave up on his old ways, choosing to live as an honest stay-at-home husband instead. Naturally, he can never truly escape his past, which is still recognizable in his appearance, attitude, and behavior, but the legendary &#34;Immortal Dragon&#34; is gone, and so are his days of skirmishes. Rather than living for his yakuza group, he is now dedicated to taking care of his family, shopping, cooking, and even sewing for them, if needed. This is a simple yet enjoyable comedic title that presents the yakuza in an entirely new light.





 9  Hinamatsuri 
        

Hinamatsuri is an underrated title that combines two themes that may seem completely unrelated at a glance, childcare and organized crime. The story revolves around an odd duo formed of Hina, a mysterious girl with supernatural powers, and Yoshifumi Nitta, a yakuza member, the former of whom suddenly showed up in the latter&#39;s house. Feeling threatened yet also intrigued by Hina&#39;s powers, which could prove helpful to his own life as a yakuza, Nitta decides to take her under his care. Thanks to a unique cast of characters and comedy that subverts all expectations, this title stands out as one of the most memorable shows of its type.





 8  Tokyo Revengers 
        

For the most part, Tokyo Revengers portrays gangs that are more similar to the bosozoku - young bikers - rather than the yakuza, as they consist not of adults engaging in criminal activity, but rather of teenagers concerned with local turf wars. However, there are scenes where Toman&#39;s natural evolution into a full-fledged yakuza group is clearly displayed, such as a timeline when the now-adult characters are noted to be involved with various crimes, exerting their control over Tokyo. Largely, though, the story revolves around the origins and developments of the Toyko Manji Gang, as Takemichi Hanagaki relives his past in an attempt to prevent the tragic death of his first and only girlfriend.





 7  K 
        

While it does not directly mention yakuza, the story of K revolves around clans led by Kings, who command respect and loyalty from every clan member. Therefore, despite having different names, these clans could easily be associated with the yakuza theme, as they share an emphasis on hierarchy and loyalty. As such, in this world dominated by supernatural powers where honor is valued above all, the brutal murder of a member of the red clan triggers one of the best revenge plots in anime, which gradually evolves into something much greater, revealing a surprisingly complex story defined by plot twists and unexpected developments. The beautiful visuals and sound design also contribute to the experience.





 6  The Gokusen 
        

As Kumiko Yamaguchi finally gets the chance to begin her dream career as a math teacher, the class she is assigned to turns out to be full of rowdy delinquents who have no interest in learning. While their attempts to torment their teachers would make most people quit, Kumiko is not an ordinary teacher. She is also the heir of the Oedo Group, a powerful yakuza clan, and her incredible resilience and strength allow her to quickly gain the respect of her students. Naturally, she can&#39;t let anyone else know about her background either, as it would pose a serious threat to her career.





 5  Great Pretender 
        

Due to a series of unfortunate events, Makoto Edamura feels that he has no choice but to turn to a life of petty crime and drama, which results in him being Japan&#39;s self-proclaimed top swindler. However, one of his usual tricks ends up backfiring, with him becoming the victim of a deception instead. This is how he meets fellow con man Laurent Thierry and joins his team, involving himself in increasingly complex plans of international high-stakes fraud. While yakuza may not be the main focus of this title, the show is divided into different cases, the final of which revolves around yakuza and their international crimes, which Makoto&#39;s group infiltrates and interferes with.

 4  Great Teacher Onizuka 
        

Despite not directly depicting the yakuza, Great Teacher Onizuka is a highly influential title that includes a similar theme. As an ex-biker gang leader, the titular Eikichi Onizuka grew up among crime and vandalism, being more than familiar with illegal activities and unruly groups. Even his decision to become a teacher is not determined by some selfless altruism or long-held dream, but rather by the simple desire to meet high-school girls. However, he quickly drops this idea when he realizes just how much he can influence and help students, in his own unconventional ways. While this is not strictly a yakuza show, GTO is such a gem that it is worth checking out by anime fans at large.





 3  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu 
        

Yet another title seeking to depict a former yakuza turning over a new leaf and going through one of the best redemption arcs in anime, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu follows Yotarou, a man who, upon being released from prison, decides to abandon his old ways and pursue a new lifestyle. Inspired by a performance of the distinguished Yakumo Yuurakutei, Yotarou sets his mind on joining the rakugo world, eventually becoming the first apprentice of the one who allowed him to find his dream. From the profound and impactful story to the nuanced and realistic characters, there are plenty of reasons why this unique show is as highly regarded as it is.





 2  Akiba Maid War 
        

Combining maids with the yakuza certainly sounds like a strange idea, but Akiba Maid War proves that it works better than one would expect. Here, Akihabara&#39;s famous maid cafÃ©s are not just places where customers are served by apron-wearing girls, but also groups that, much like the yakuza, are vying for influence, competing with each other behind the scenes. Moreover, they aren&#39;t simply competing based on profits or clients; they are in a constant state of war, attacking each other with knives and guns. As brutal and serious as this title may be at times, there is also a comedic aspect to it, making it that much more enjoyable and unique.





 1  Bungo Stray Dogs 
        

Bungo Stray Dogs presents itself not as a story about the yakuza, but rather one following those who oppose the yakuza. The show focuses on the action surrounding the Armed Detective Agency, a group of people who wield supernatural abilities to combat the Port Mafia and keep their damages at bay. In spite of its name, the Port Mafia is a criminal organization that&#39;s more similar to the yakuza than the mafia in many ways, as they follow similar structures and rules. Not only are they generally accepted by the police as they have financial and political influence, but they also tend to avoid the drug industry.
Some of these titles focus entirely on yakuza-themed settings or otherwise similar organized groups that resemble the yakuza in every way but their specific name. In others, they play a less central yet still important role, acting as either the antagonists or occasionally supporting characters that drive the action behind the scenes. Whether they are still active or somehow safely retired, such characters typically end up being interesting and charismatic in their own way. As such, while they may not be numerous, the best yakuza anime always make for a refreshing and enjoyable experience.
