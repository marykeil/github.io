## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1082 will end the intense battle against Admiral Ryokugyu and also reveal more bits of lore that could have major ramifications.




After One Piece episode #1081 featured an intense battle between an admiral and the fighting forces of Wano, fans are eagerly awaiting episode #1082 to see how the fight ends. However, episode #1081 also set up some plot threads that are more important for the world at large. If episode #1082 also touches on some of those (and based on its title it likely will) then it will be even more exciting for fans to see.





 What Time One Piece Episode #1082 Releases 
          

One Piece episode #1081, titled &#34;The Coming of the New Era! The Red-Haired&#39;s Imperial Rage&#34; will air on Sunday, November 5 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 4 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, November 5 at 3:00 a.m. British Summer Time (BST) for One Piece fans in the UK. Fans of the English dub will have to wait for that version to premiere on Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Episode #1081 of One Piece? 
          




Episode #1081 continued to reveal the ramifications of Luffy&#39;s debut of Gear 5 to the world at large. High-ranking navy officials like Akainu discussed it and also mentioned the shocking bit of information that Sabo apparently assassinated King Cobra at the Reverie. More immediately important was the reaction of Shanks&#39; crew as they approached Wano in this episode, but decided not to meet Luffy yet. However, Shanks will still likely play a role in episode #1082 given its title. The episode also featured a battle between the Admiral Ryokugyu and the Red Scabbards, who are unable to easily defeat him. Even the help of Momo and Yamato may not be enough although that will likely be explored more in episode #1082.



 One Piece Episode #1082 Will Finish The Fight With Ryokugyu 
          

Given where episode #1081 ended, episode #1082 will probably begin by concluding the fight with Ryokugyu. While One Piece&#39;s new admiral is incredibly strong, which could maybe cause the fight to go longer, given this fight is taking place after the end of Wano&#39;s climactic fight between Luffy and Kaido it wouldn&#39;t make sense on a narrative level for the show to drag it in for too long. Thus, Ryokugyu will likely be defeated soon, or the Straw Hats will flee Wano while the others are distracting him. Given the title of episode #1082 Shanks will likely also have a major role to play, although it is unclear what that would be given he isn&#39;t planning on meeting up with the Straw Hats.




Episode #1082 will also likely continue the trend of showing other major figures in the world reacting to Luffy&#39;s rise to power. Given some of the bombshell lore info these scenes have revealed so far, this may introduce major plot elements that will be important for the arcs ahead. Overall, One Piece episode #1082 is expected to be an exciting continuation of the current battle that will have larger ramifications for the overarching story.

Catch One Piece episode #1082 when it releases on Crunchyroll on November 5, 2023.
