# Sword Art Online s Fourth World Proves SAO Only Got Better Over Time


## SUMMARY 



  Later arcs in Sword Art Online move away from Aincrad, which disappoints some fans who only cared about that world.   Each subsequent world builds upon the previous ones, offering a different perspective and improving the storytelling.   Underworld introduces new elements and dynamics that wouldn&#39;t have been possible in Aincrad, enhancing the overall Sword Art Online experience.

## Literature Review

Although most fans prefer Aincrad, Sword Art Online&#39;s story just kept getting better from Alfheim Online to Gun Gale Online and then to Underworld.




Critics of Sword Art Online&#39;s later arcs likely dislike them because they move the story away from the only one they initially cares about – Aincrad. To them, each subsequent world that doesn&#39;t return there is worse than the last. However, by the time Sword Art Online reaches Underworld in the Alicization Arc, everything has not only already improved four times, but all of them build upon each other and view the same characteristics from a different perspective in a way that would have been impossible if the story remained in Aincrad.




During the Fairy Dance Arc, Alfheim Online (ALO) improved the entire situation that SAO creator Akihiko Kayaba forced upon the original 10,000 players by making it much more personal for Kirito. Kayaba didn&#39;t target Kirito – or Asuma – from the start. The two only formed that strange bond after extenuating circumstances. ALO&#39;s Nobuyuki Sugou&#39;s actions, however, were very personal, and he even managed to up the stakes beyond the threat of death by promising a lifetime of torture for Asuma two-fold, in real life and in the game. Meanwhile, Gun Gale Online (GGO) was the perfect sequel because it brought SAO&#39;s Laughing Coffin members into a new setting that flipped how players died in the game.


 Underworld&#39;s Impressive Events Couldn&#39;t Have Happened in Sword Art Online&#39;s Aincrad 
Created by A-1 Pictures, based on the original light novels by Reki Kawahara
          

Then the Alicization Arc&#39;s &#34;Underworld&#34; did something different to the overall anime adaptation of the original light novel by writer Reki Kawahara and illustrator abec. Up until then, the first three arcs had been about how sick individuals took advantage of players in a game to exercise complete control over them in different ways. Kayaba would never have gotten as personal as Sugou did, which justified ALO, and the Laughing Coffin members wouldn&#39;t have been able to kill as they did in GGO because they couldn&#39;t actually commit murder in the game, but were able to log out and kill the players in real life. In the Alicization Arc, the villains use Underworld as a means to make the real world a better place by replacing real-life soldiers with the characters in the game. Moreover, the creation of Underworld was contingent on the repurposing of a machine that was introduced in SAO&#39;s third arc within ALO.




In the Underworld game, the Alicization Arc reexamined certain elements of Aincrad in a similar setting by giving them a completely new spin that wouldn&#39;t have been possible in SAO. SAO&#39;s gameplay was very much game-based with strict rules and a specific power system that emulated normal RPGs. However, Underworld added a more lifelike dynamic to its gameplay that shares more similarities with characters in other anime that don&#39;t take place in games. In other words, characters are able to &#34;break&#34; Underworld&#39;s normal RPG system if they believe in their weapon or have a strong enough will to power their blade. For example, the power of a character named Volo is derived from the burden of his lineage. This would never have been possible in Aincrad. Then, much like how Kirito used the skills he learned in GGO to overpower his opponents in ALO, Kirito actually utilizes Aincrad skills in Underworld that are godlike and unstoppable there, since they are from a different game. This dynamic obviously wouldn&#39;t have been able to happen if Kirito remained in Aincrad because he would just be using skills from there.






 Sword Art Online Was Already Too Repetitive Before ALO 
          

It&#39;s understandable why fans got attached to Aincrad, and their steadfast loyalty to that world is a testament to how well it was written. However, each arc that took the story to new worlds allowed Sword Art Online to more readily and capably explore new types of conflict, foresee varying disastrous repercussions should the heroes lose, and create different combinations of similar concepts through the incorporation of elements from one world into others. In this way, Underworld greatly improved upon ALO, GGO, and most especially Sword Art Online&#39;s Aincrad.
