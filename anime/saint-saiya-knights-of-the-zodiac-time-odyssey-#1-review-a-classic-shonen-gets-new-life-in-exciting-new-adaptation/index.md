## Literature Review

Saint Seiya - Knights of the Zodiac: Time Odyssey #1 is a great start for new readers to the series and a fun adventure for fans of the original.





Based on the Netflix adaptation of the hit series, Saint Seiya - Knights of the Zodiac, this new comic provides a new adventure for the main characters. A summary of base events is provided in the first few pages, which cover Part 1 of the show, as well the first four volumes of the original manga series by Masami Kurumada. The newest series from Ablaze Publishing has the creative team of Jerome Alquie and Arnaud Dollen, with inspiration and story basis from the original manga&#39;s creator, Masami Kurumada.




                  30 Best Anime Series of All Time, Ranked   Anime has exploded in popularity recently, so it&#39;s natural to wonder what series in the medium&#39;s history rank among the best of the best.   


 Saint Seiya Returns in a Stunning, Original Story 
          

Saint Seiya - Knights of the Zodiac: Time Odyssey presents a brief introduction to its main characters and their backstory, then sets up a new fight ahead. Following the resurrection of the Phoenix Knight, Ikki, the threat of Chronos has come to Tokyo&#39;s Graad Foundation Manor. The Twelve Hours, knights of Chronos, begin a face-off with Athena&#39;s knights, as they seek Ikki&#39;s destruction. This first issue is full of some of the most compelling elements of Saint Seiya: intense combat, the strength of a brotherhood, and influential Greek story elements. All of this makes for an intriguing blend, enhanced by a full-color issue.




Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac was originally serialized and published in black and white, back in 1985. Since then, it has been adapted for anime series and an animated adaptation from Netflix in 2019. This new iteration from Ablaze changes the original formula, taking on a traditionally Westernized format. It reads from left to right, with full-color pages, in a 32-page issue, the way most North American comics are printed. This change&#39;s success will be entirely based on reader preference.

The story and character designs are highly reminiscent and loyal to the original series. Each character&#39;s powers and armor appearance match the original designs. The art style stays true to a general manga style, foregoing the 3D, CGI-animated nature of the most recent adaptation from Netflix. This makes it a story that is accessible for fans of either the original anime/manga series or the newest adaptation, as well as completely new readers learning about the Knights of the Zodiac for the first time. The new threat is well-designed, adding to the mythos of the world. Chronos made an appearance in Saint Seiya: Next Dimension and the alternative timeline of Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas. Arctos and the Twelve Hours are new, original characters that fit well into the world of the franchise. Saint Saiya - Knights of the Zodiac: Time Odyssey #1 is an intriguing and respectful addition to this generation&#39;s iteration of the classic series.
