## Literature Review

Not even halfway through the debut episode of KamiErabi GOD.app, the series gives a brutal twist to a well-known trope in Reincarnation Isekai..




Warning: Spoilers for KamiErabi GOD.app episode #2The creators of Crunchyroll&#39;s new deathgame anime KamiErabi GOD.app must have known what parallels they were drawing to isekai when the protagonist Goro witnessed a truck about to hit a cat. However, KamiErabi GOD.app gives the overused isekai plot line a brutal twist by having Goro just watch as the entire brutal scene unfolds before his eyes.




While isekai recycles numerous tropes to a comical extent, the use of the reincarnation-inducing truck in the genre is undoubtedly the most ubiquitous and possibly most beloved of them all. Some even jokingly refer to the truck that triggers an isekai protagonist&#39;s reincarnation as &#34;truck-san&#34; for its frequent use.

          

When a truck appears in isekai, the hero is destined to jump in the way and die so that they can reincarnate in their new life. However, this doesn&#39;t happen in episode #1 of KamiErabi GOD.app by creator Yoko Taro (NieR:Automata), producer Unend, and director Hiroyuki Seshita.


 KamiErabi GOD.app&#39;s Truck Scene Subverts a Huge Isekai Trope 
         




As of episode #2, the reason for the scene has yet to be explained. It&#39;s possible that Taro just wanted to poke fun at the trope by having the hero not do what would have been expected of him. In all honesty, Goro could have very well jumped in the way of the truck and reincarnated into a new world with otherworldly powers without changing too much about the series. After he fails to save the cat, Goro is forcibly enrolled in a death match to become the next god and is able to wield a karma-based ability through his little, flying companion named Lall.

A possibility is that Goro&#39;s failure to save the cat was a test that made him eligible for the death games. After witnessing the horrific scene, Goro receives a strange message on his phone that informs him that he&#39;s &#34;been chosen.&#34; Since participants in the death match are required to kill each other, it&#39;s plausible that a test was necessary to see if prospective contenders were selfish enough to not save something as innocent as a cat. Moreover, the fact that everyone else who was present to witness the accident were completely frozen during the scene creates the impression that it was an otherworldly experience.




          

Regardless, KamiErabi GOD.app functions more effectively as something other than an isekai because the most effective dynamic in the series thus far are Goro&#39;s relationships in the game as he made them before his life changed forever. As a result, Goro must contend with surviving and the prospect of killing people he already knew in his normal life. Although difficult to murder someone, it&#39;s inherently much harder when the target is familiar. So while Crunchyroll&#39;s new deathgame anime KamiErabi GOD.app brutally deconstructs isekai&#39;s most infamous trope, it&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s the only way the series mimics the genre.

The latest episode of KamiErabi GOD.app is available now on Crunchyroll!
