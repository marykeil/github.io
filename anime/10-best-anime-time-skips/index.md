## Literature Review

Time skips are a famous part of many anime franchises, with the best time skips developing the characters and moving the story forward.




The best time skips in anime are most commonly found in long-running shonen series, but they are not restricted to such, as a good time skip only requires two things: the creation of a fresh platform for explosive story and character growth, and the compression of less interesting points in time.
Furthermore, a time skip does not need to strictly move in a single direction, or even laterally at that. Series like The Ambition of Oda Nobunaga, will skip backwards in time when a modern high school student finds himself transported to the warring states of the Sengoku period in the 16th century. Then, there are series like Baccano! where the entire premise is to move between narratives and timelines, creating a temporal web of mysteries. Therefore, any anime that displays these qualities and aftermaths of a time skip are worth consideration.

 5  Chihayafuru’s Present is Based on Past Relationships 
Based on the manga by Suetsugu Yuki
        

Chihayafuru is perhaps the farthest from the typical battle shonen series that utilizes time skips, but its unique sports anime-style format and its meaningful extended flashbacks provide a wide platform for the exploration of characters, their relationships, and the game Karuta. The first episode opens in the present but dives into an extended flashback that continues until episode four, representing a time skip into the past, and then back. The flashback is a story in and of itself and provides history for the characters who have developed and will continue to develop as the anime progresses. Throughout three seasons, Chihayafuru gracefully weaves the stories of the past and present together. 
            
 
 Manga Can Make Anything Compelling, and One Series Proves it
