# Dragon Ball GTs God of Destruction Can Beat Lord Beerus


## SUMMARY 



  Lord Luud, the &#34;God of Destruction&#34; in Dragon Ball GT, has the ability to transform anyone into a doll with a single blast from his laser eyes.   Despite not being a true deity, Lord Luud&#39;s power surpasses that of Lord Beerus, the actual God of Destruction in Dragon Ball Super.   While it would be difficult for Lord Luud to hit Lord Beerus with his power, the fact remains that he possesses a power that could defeat Beerus in one shot, which not many in the Dragon Ball multiverse can claim.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball GT has its very own version of a God of Destruction, and this fighter has one power that can defeat Super&#39;s Lord Beerus like it&#39;s nothing.




Gods of Destruction within the Dragon Ball mythos are some of the most powerful entities in the multiverse, and none are more powerful than Lord Beerus–at least, that’s what fans thought, as there is one ‘God of Destruction’ introduced in Dragon Ball GT who could beat Lord Beerus with a single move.




Lord Beerus made his debut in Dragon Ball Super chapter 1 by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou, and right from the start, it was clear that he was an unparalleled threat. In this chapter, Lord Beerus travels to Earth seeking an entity known as the Super Saiyan God after he had a vision that detailed his own demise by the hand of that very being. While the Saiyans Beerus fights (Goku and Vegeta) are in no way strong enough to kill him, Beerus does see value in their seemingly limitless potential and decides to essentially recruit them as his own personal go-to multiversal warriors. Now, in the current state of Dragon Ball Super, Goku and Vegeta are training on Beerus’ world–though if Beerus ever found himself going up against GT’s ‘God of Destruction’, it would become clear that he was the one in need of some extra training instead.

                  Dragon Ball&#39;s Best Plot Twist is Also its Most Subtle   Dragon Ball is a series filled with plot twists, but one stands above the rest as the best of them all, and it is the last one fans would expect.    





 Lord Luud Could Transform Lord Beerus into a Powerless Doll with One Blast 
          

In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 13 (written by Aya Matsui, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), Pan, Trunks, and Goku find themselves on a strange alien world in pursuit of the Black Star Dragon Balls–a world that is dedicated to the worship of a God of Destruction, Lord Luud. In this episode, Trunks and Goku are battling Lord Luud who was resurrected a few episodes prior. While Luud has been worshiped as a God of Destruction by his dedicated followers for decades, Trunks and Goku learn that he’s not actually a deity at all, but rather a super powerful android known as a Machine Mutant. However, his God of Destruction title is one that was still well-earned as Luud has one power that could beat Lord Beerus–a true God of Destruction–like it’s nothing.




One of Lord Luud’s trademark powers in Dragon Ball GT is his ability to transform anyone he zaps with his laser eyes into a doll, with no clear limitations set in terms of the power levels of his victims. This means that, no matter how strong someone is, they can be turned into a doll all the same–and that includes Lord Beerus. In previous battles with lesser foes, Lord Beerus has been shown toying with his opponents rather than finishing them off outright. In his first fight with Goku, Beerus just dodged Goku’s attacks before flicking him in the forehead and then simply touching his shoulder to end the fight completely. This level of flippant, carefree combat would give Lord Luud the advantage he’d need to send a single, unexpected blast from his eyes right into the body of the unprepared Lord Beerus–effectively turning him into a powerless doll.

While Lord Luud does have a special power that could earn him victory over Lord Beerus with a single shot, it is worth noting that getting that shot would be near impossible unless Beerus totally let his guard down (which isn’t outside the realm of possibility given his established hubris). However, the fact that Dragon Ball GT’s ‘God of Destruction’ can beat Lord Beerus with one blast isn’t something that can be so easily dismissed because it would be a hard blast ot pull off, as it is more than practically anyone else in the Dragon Ball multiverse can say–including Goku and Vegeta.
