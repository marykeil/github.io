## Literature Review

WIT Studio announced the sequel to Great Pretender, subtitled &#34;razbliuto&#34;, as well as the anime&#39;s new streaming home on Crunchyroll.




The crime anime Great Pretender is continuing with a new sequel that will be streaming exclusively on Crunchyroll. Great Pretender razbliuto doesn&#39;t have a firm release date, but will be coming sometime in 2024. The new teaser trailer, while not heavy on details, does emphasize a new protagonist, hinting that this continuation might not revisit Laurent and Makoto.




WIT Studio broke the news with the reveal of a new teaser trailer on its Great Pretender website, as well as a promotional image on its X accoun t (formerly Twitter). Both hint at an all-new cast, with the character Dorothy being front and center. Despite Netflix getting international broadcast rights in 2020, for whatever reason, the streaming service has passed up the sequel, leaving Crunchyroll to pick it up in its stead.

                  10 Best Anime For Crime Drama &amp; Heist Fans   Fans have the benefit of a wide variety of subgenres within the anime scene, and these are some of the best for crime drama and heist fans.   


 Great Pretender razbliuto May Focus On A New Team 
Created by WIT Studio, Great Pretender was a sleeper hit when it came out in 2020.

 

Great Pretender Season 1 follows a team of con men who swindle other criminals deserving of retribution. While the first season followed a core group of course characters – Makoto, Laurent, Abigail, and Cynthia – the new teaser image shows no sign of them. Instead, Dorothy, a significant character from Laurent&#39;s past who made her appearance in the season&#39;s last arc, seems to be taking center stage. Whether this indicates that the first gang will not be returning at all is unknown; still, with the image showing a large cast of new designs, Great Pretender may well decide not to spare any room for more.




                  Great Pretender Brought New Life to an Underrated Anime Genre   The heist genre has been played out many times over the years - here’s how Great Pretender proved that this subgenre is severely underrated.   

Anime News Network has revealed that Crunchyroll will be broadcasting the second season, which puts the anime in a peculiar state. Netflix still streams the first season, splitting the anime between two mutually exclusive services. This perhaps could be the reason why the second season might have a new cast, rather than frustrate new audiences who would be unable to follow continuity due to this streaming conflict. Whatever the case, it can be confirmed that many staff members involved in Great Pretender are returning: Hiro Kaburagi returns as director, while head writer Ryota Kosawa will be handling the script supervision.

          




Great Pretender was a sleeper hit in 2020, going under most radars, while gaining approval from fans for its premise, an excellent English dub, and a story that visited international locations uncommon in anime, most significantly Singapore in the second arc. Thankfully, Wit Studio seems to have plenty of confidence in this IP, even if it requires a new protagonist. The second season&#39;s subtitle, &#34;Razbliuto&#34;, describes a sense of fondness for someone after one stops loving them. Whatever this could foreshadow is anyone&#39;s guess, which makes Great Pretender all the more worth anticipating when it arrives next year in 2024.
