## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End has officially started its First-Class Mage Exam arc, which introduces a number of new characters with new abilities.




Warning: Contains MAJOR spoilers for Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End!Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End is airing its second cour, and has officially entered the First-Class Mage Exam arc. Frieren, Fern, and Stark previously learned that a first-class mage license is a requirement for traveling through the Northern Plateau, and with them being unable to afford any alternatives, Frieren and Fern decide to take the first-class mage exam upon arriving in the city of Äußerst.
Naturally, Frieren and Fern aren&#39;t the only people trying to earn a first-class mage license, and Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End&#39;s latest arc has introduced a wide assortment of mages all vying for a license. While some of the new characters don&#39;t receive much screen time, many of the new characters in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End have substantial development in many of the future story arcs.
        

There are certainly a lot of new characters to keep track of, but overall, they all serve as wonderful additions to an already vibrant cast that will help this critically acclaimed anime reach its next, exciting stage.

While anime EDs aren&#39;t typically as iconic as the much flashier openings, 2023 released some incredibly cool endings that go against this trend.












 








 13  Frieren 
Frieren The Slayer, the legendary mage who defeated the Demon King


 







The first notable mage is, of course, the titular protagonist, Frieren. Frieren is taking the first-class mage exam for the sake of continuing her journey to Ende with the rest of her party. Thanks to being an elf, Frieren has over a thousand years&#39; worth of experience using magic, and she currently stands as one of the most powerful mages in the story.
Frieren doesn&#39;t have any particular specialty, but she does tend to default to using Zoltraak because of how efficient it is in its simplicity. Frieren&#39;s greatest asset, besides the incredible control of her mana, perhaps lies in the endless list of spells she has collected over the course of her life. While Frieren has a tendency to pick up the most niche and apparently useless spells, this still gives her a lot of flexibility.

 12  Fern 
Frieren&#39;s Exceptional Apprentice


 







The next notable mage in the First-Class Mage Exam arc is Fern, the deuteragonist of the series. Fern has been Frieren&#39;s student since she was a child, and just like Frieren, she seeks to earn a first-class mage license so their party can continue their journey to Ende. As Frieren&#39;s student, Fern doesn&#39;t have a particular specialty beyond defaulting to Zoltraak for its efficiency.
However, it&#39;s also been noted that while Frieren is still more powerful than Fern, Fern is much faster at casting spells than her, something that&#39;s been taken advantage of on numerous occasions in the story. Several times, Frieren has intend that Fern&#39;s raw talent is exceptional and puts her above even more experienced mages.





 11  Kanne 
The Cowardly Water Mage
        

The first stage of the first-class mage exam broke everyone up into teams, and one of Frieren&#39;s teammates is the third-class mage Kanne. Kanne entered the exam alongside her classmate, Lawine, and while the two of them are friends, they&#39;re constantly bickering with each other due to their differing personalities and perspectives, with Kanne&#39;s cowardice often being a major sticking point for Lawine.
Kanne&#39;s specialty is water manipulation magic, which she combines with Lawine&#39;s ice magic to great effect, but despite its power, since she&#39;s unable to create water with her magic, Kanne is essentially useless without a sufficient water source.





 10  Lawine 
The Levelheaded Ice Mage
        

The second member of Frieren’s three-man team is the third-class mage Lawine. Compared to Kanne, Lawine is a far more serious and grounded person, and as a result, the two of them often end up fighting every moment they get, despite them having been friends for years.
Similar to Kanne, Lawine&#39;s magic is a form of water manipulation, specifically the ability to freeze water and control the resulting ice, and while it makes her an ideal partner for Kanne, she has a similar weakness of not being able to fight as effectively without a physical water source to draw power from.





 9  Übel 
The Psychotic Genius


 







One of Fern&#39;s teammates for the first stage of the first-class mage exam is the third-class mage Übel. Übel is a somewhat unhinged individual who gets a thrill out of killing other people, even failing to get promoted to second-class mage for killing the proctor. Übel has two unique types of magic. Her primary magic, Reelseiden, creates an invisible blade that can cut anything so long as Übel perceives it as something that can be cut regardless of its specific properties. 
Übel&#39;s second unique magic is more subtle but also potentially more dangerous. She can copy the magical abilities of anyone whom she&#39;s managed to empathize with, meaning she can be at the same time a danger and a great asset to the other mages.





 8  Land 
The Stoic Illusionist
        

Land, another one of Fern&#39;s teammates, is characterized as a serious and stoic individual who doesn&#39;t trust others easily. Land has enough of a conscience to not want to needlessly hurt people, nor does he like the idea of other people dying for his sake. Land specializes in illusion magic, most notably using it to create clones of himself and others.
The end of the First-Class Mage Exam arc revealed that Land was taking his cloning so far that he had a clone of himself be the one to take the exam in his place while he stayed at home in his village.





 7  Wirbel 
The Bruiser With A Heart Of Gold
        

The second-class mage Wirbel is the captain of the Northern Magic Corps and is taking the exam to participate in the subjugation of territories further north on the continent. Despite his tough demeanor and appearance, Wirbel is actually a kind person who abhors violence and only sees killing as a last result.
This attitude is even reflected in Wirbel&#39;s signature magic, Sorganeel, which allows him to trap anyone he looks at in magical bindings so long as he can see their entire body, making it an efficient way of defeating opponents nonviolently.





 6  Ehre 
The Mage Academy&#39;s Valedictorian
        

Another notable member of Wirbel&#39;s team in the first stage is a second-class mage named Ehre. Ehre specializes in earth magic, primarily using it to shoot small rocks at her opponents at high velocity. When fighting Fern during the first stage of the first-class mage exam, Fern noted that Ehre was one of the strongest mages taking the exam.
Despite that, however, Fern was still able to defeat her with her superior skill in basic magic, and while her team progressed far through the first-class mage exam, Ehre only managed to get to the final stage before ultimately failing to earn her license.





 5  Methode 
The Bizarre Priestess
        

Another notable mage in the First-Class Mage Exam arc is the second-class mage Methode. While Methode comes off as a serious older woman, she has an obsession with cute things, specifically elves like Frieren, and always tries to hug them whenever she has the chance. Methode is skilled in restraint and hypnosis magic and can assess a person&#39;s resistance to them with a single touch.
Methode&#39;s appearance in the Demon General Subjugation arc revealed that she can also use Goddess magic, something she used to try and join Frieren&#39;s party, but she was rebuked due to Sein still being considered a member.





 4  Denken 
The Last Survivor Of Weise
        

One of the most important mages introduced in the First-Class Mage Exam arc is the second-class mage Denken. While Denken already serves as an imperial mage, one of the highest-ranked positions a mage can hold, he wishes to become a first-class mage so he can return to his hometown of Weise and free it from the curse of the Sage of Destruction Macht of the Golden Land. 
This storyline is the major focus of volumes 9-12 of the manga, which will be adapted later in the anime. To go along with that, Denken, after earning his license, obtained Mystil&#39;zla, a powerful curse reversal magic capable of countering Macht&#39;s abilities that became essential in the fight against him.

From sequels that exceed the expectations set by their predecessors to new stories that took the world by storm, 2023 was a great year for fantasy.








 3  Richter 
The Arrogant Shopkeep
        

One of Denken&#39;s teammates in the first stage of the first-class mage exam is the second-class mage, Richter. Richter runs the best magic tool shop in Äußerst, and has an arrogant attitude towards those he perceives as weaker than him. Even with that, he&#39;s able to get along with his teammates both during and after the first-class mage exam and can work with others when necessary.
Richter specializes in earth manipulation magic, and according to him, manipulating the elements is the way that modern mages are supposed to fight each other, since magic shields can only withstand so much force before breaking.





 2  Laufen 
The Fragile Speedster
        

Denken&#39;s second teammate in the first stage of the first-class mage exam is the second-class mage Laufen. Laufen is far younger than the middle-aged Richter and the elderly Denken, and because of that, Denken often coddles Laufen and treats her like she were his own granddaughter, and Laufen usually goes along with the treatment.
Laufen&#39;s signature magic is Jilwer, which allows her to move at incredible speeds to the point that she&#39;s invisible to the naked eye, but a fatal flaw, of course, is that she can be subdued if someone knows where she&#39;s going to go with her ability.





 1  Edel 
The Genius Telepath
        

The final notable mage introduced in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End First-Class Mage Exam arc is the second-class mage Edel. Edel is a serious, yet apathetic individual, and while her telepathic abilities are known to be powerful, the way the second stage of the exam was structured caused her to fail and not earn her license.
Nevertheless, in the El Dorado arc, Edel will play a major role. After being brought to Weise to help with repairing Macht&#39;s Stone Bracelet of Sovereignty, Edel used her magic to read a century’s worth of memories from Macht. This ended up being the key to defeating Macht and freeing Weise from the effects of his curse.
