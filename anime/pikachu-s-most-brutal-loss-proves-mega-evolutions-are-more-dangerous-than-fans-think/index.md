## Literature Review

A brutal battle between Pikachu and a Mega Lucario proved that despite fans&#39; love for the feature, Mega Evolutions are actually incredibly dangerous.




Fans of Pokémon have a special love for the Mega Evolution gimmick, but the anime proved just how hazardous the transformation can be by serving Ash&#39;s Pikachu one of his most brutal losses of all time. In Pikachu&#39;s duel with a first-time evolving Mega Lucario, the opposing Pokémon lost control and laid an absolute beatdown on the electric mouse.




The Pokémon XY anime introduced the concept of Mega Evolution with a few early appearances, but it didn&#39;t take a major role in the story until a multi-episode story arc following Shalour City gym leader Korrina&#39;s quest to find a Mega Stone for her Lucario. Ash and friends decide to tag along, since they&#39;re headed to the same place and want to see Lucario Mega Evolve. After finding the stone, Ash challenges Korrina to a little battle in &#34;The Aura Storm!&#34;, and gets far more than he bargained for.

          

Mega Lucario beats Pikachu handily, but doesn&#39;t stop once Pikachu is down. Its eyes glowing red out of control, and it goes in for another attack, even after Ash shields Pikachu with his body. It&#39;s only thanks to the timely intervention of Korrina&#39;s grandfather that things don&#39;t get truly messy.





 Mega Evolution Can Drive Pokémon Mad With Power 
          

While earlier instances of Mega Evolution showcased experienced users, like Diantha&#39;s Gardevoir, Korrina&#39;s Lucario was completely unfamiliar with the power of Mega Evolution, and let that power go to its head. This battle was meant to be a simple test of Lucario&#39;s new power, a demonstration for Ash and his friends; there was no need for Lucario to attack so fiercely. It&#39;s a rare case of a Pokémon in a battle targeting a trainer directly, proving that Lucario really wasn&#39;t able to think clearly in the Mega state. Despite a strong bond being said to be essential to Mega Evolution, even Korrina and Lucario&#39;s lifelong bond wasn&#39;t enough to help it see the light.

Many of the Pokédex entries about Mega Evolution in the Sun and Moon games imply it&#39;s a stressful experience, and other Mega Pokémon (such as Mega Salamence) have been said to pose a threat to their trainers, but such a thing is never shown. While fans resented the implication that X &amp; Y&#39;s Mega Evolution was dangerous, this episode proves that Mega Evolution was always intended to be a risky proposition for all but the greatest trainers. Interestingly, Ash and his own Lucario, which would later go on to Mega Evolve, didn&#39;t have these problems when they first attempted it, perhaps speaking to Ash&#39;s quality as a trainer.




It&#39;s also worth noting that this wasn&#39;t a one-time fluke; for several episodes, every time Korrina&#39;s Lucario would Mega Evolve, it would eventually lose control, until Korrina and Lucario went through some special training designed to help manage this new power. Without an experienced user of Mega Evolution to teach them, Korrina and Lucario may never have successfully mastered the power. This all helps to explain why Mega Evolution is used relatively rarely in the Pokémon world; while it offers tremendous power, that power could just as easily be turned against an inexperienced trainer, so most are better off just not attempting it.
