## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #13 will continue the party&#39;s adventures in the North and likely return to a more episodic style.




After making it through the mountains in episode #12, Frieren and her party are finally back in civilization, which means that Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #13 can see the group traveling from town to town helping people once more. Of course before they do that, the near-immortal Frieren may have to get officially certified as a mage. This shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for her to do but it will likely lead to some amusing adventures.





 What Time Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #13 Releases 
          

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #13 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, December 1. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on December 1 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #12? 
          

Episode #12 begins with Frieren passing out from the cold and remembering when her previous party had first met with the king. This transitioned nicely into her present party reaching the village guarding the true hero&#39;s sword. After destroying a group of monsters there it was revealed that Himmel hadn&#39;t actually been able to claim that sword, which shocked Stark. The rest of the episode then focused on Stark as he recalled his past in a village of warriors and realized that his brother may have been kinder to him than he had thought.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #13 Will Go Back to Its Roots 
          

While Frieren does need to get certified as a mage soon in order to allow her party to travel unimpeded in the far north, the series will likely take its time getting there. Along the way, Frieren, Fern, and Stark will almost certainly encounter villages that need their help in one way or another. This will allow the show to be more episodic just like it was in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s great first episodes. While this may be frustrating for fans who want to see Frieren and her friends accomplish their mission as quickly as possible, the show is so naturally compelling that the episode will still likely be excellent.

Given Frieren and her friends are now further north, they may also encounter some more demon forces. With the Demon King&#39;s base of operations in the north, this is practically an inevitability before the season ends. These characters are some of Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s most fascinating villains so this would also make for an awesome episode #13.




Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #13 when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 1, 2023.
