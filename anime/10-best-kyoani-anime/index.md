 10  Lucky Star Is A Perfect Time Capsule For 2000s Anime 
Based on the manga Lucky Star by Kagami Yoshimizu.
        

  Release Year   2007    Number Of Episodes   24    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Funimation    
The first great Kyoto Animation anime to discuss is 2007’s Lucky Star. While Lucky Star was already a comedic manga, Kyoto Animation managed to take the comedy even further with the late Yasuhiro Takemoto’s stellar direction and by expanding on the elements of fandom culture to have it filled to the brim with anime references. Considering the period Lucky Star premiered in, those references have certainly aged the show a lot, but it still manages to be funny through its character writing, so even if someone doesn’t get all the references, it’s still plenty worth watching so many years later and is still one of Kyoto Animation’s best works.

  Release Year   2011    Number Of Episodes   26    Where To Watch It   Crunchyroll, Funimation    
Another great Kyoto Animation comedy anime is 2011’s Nichijou. Nichijou had always been a manga that thrived on surreal and absurdist storytelling, and thanks to the incredible visuals and overall direction of Tatsuya Ishihara, every joke manages to land with even greater impact than it did in the manga, making it have some of the funniest writing not just for Kyoto Animation, but for anime, in general. Nichijou might not be one of Kyoto Animation’s more famous anime, but the way that its animation lends to its comedy is a perfect encapsulation of what’s made Kyoto Animation so well-regarded over the years.
