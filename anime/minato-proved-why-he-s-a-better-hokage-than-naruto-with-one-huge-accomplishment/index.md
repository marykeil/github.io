# Minato Proved Why He s a Better Hokage Than Naruto With One Huge Accomplishment


## SUMMARY 



  Minato&#39;s accomplishments as the 4th Hokage surpass Naruto&#39;s, as he was feared in battle and made strategic sacrifices to protect his village and family.   Minato&#39;s decision to seal the Nine Tails within Naruto and himself resulted in his death and saved Konoha, highlighting his hard choices and quick thinking.   Naruto, as Hokage, failed to make tough choices like Minato did, leading to more pain and proving that his father left a tough legacy to follow.

## Literature Review

Naruto accomplished some truly incredible things during his time as Hokage, but nothing he did comes close to Minato&#39;s biggest accomplishment.




Naruto had some incredible accomplishments throughout the series, but unfortunately, he still can&#39;t top the greatest achievements of his father, Minato the Fourth Hokage. While Naruto helped win the 4th great Shinobi World War, stopped Pain&#39;s assault, and saved the ninja world on numerous occasions, Minato accomplished something much more impressive.




Minato was the 4th Hokage of the Hidden Leaf and the youngest Hokage in the village’s history. He made a name for himself in the 3rd Ninja War and was feared so much that there was a retreat order if enemies encountered him.

          

He’s used to doing the impossible but what he did before he died can only be considered a miracle when looking at the larger scope of the Naruto franchise.

 Minato Made The Sacrifice Naruto Never Could 
          

In episode 248 of Naruto Shippuden, fans were finally given the backstory of Naruto’s parents and how he came to have the Nine Tails sealed in him. This episode might be the reason Minato became the most popular character in Naruto. Kushina was a few days away from giving birth to Naruto, but this meant that the seal that caged the Nine Tails within her would be weak. Her delivery was top secret, but an unknown masked man attacked the place where Kushina was giving birth and unleashed the Nine Tails.




The resulting fight saw Minato outthink the Masked Man and nearly kill him with a well-placed Rasengan. Despite dealing with the mastermind, the Nine Tails went on a rampage across Konoha and took many lives. In order to protect his wife, his unborn son, and his village, Minato made the difficult decision to seal half of the Nine Tails fox in his son and the other half in himself. This resulted in the death of him and his wife but saved Konoha and Naruto.



 Naruto Failed to Live Up to His Father&#39;s Legacy in Boruto 
          

While Naruto&#39;s deeds throughout the series are undeniably great, nothing he did comes close to the amount of strategic planning and sacrifice Minato displayed during his last actions as Hokage. This is inadvertantly proven during Naruto&#39;s time as Hokage in Boruto. When Naruto&#39;s adopted son Kawaki became a threat to Boruto specifically and Konoha in general, Naruto failed to make the tough choices that could have prevented much of the pain that led to Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.




Though the jury is still out on Naruto&#39;s time as Hokage, his father left a tough legacy to follow. Minato made the kind of hard choice that proved why he was such a good fit for Hokage. Not only did he sacrifice himself and his wife, he also made his son a social pariah. Minato&#39;s quick thinking and willingness to make a sacrifice proves why he&#39;ll go down as a better Hokage than Naruto.
