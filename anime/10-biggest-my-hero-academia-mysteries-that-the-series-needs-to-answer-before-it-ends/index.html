  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The My Hero Academia manga is in its final arc, leaving fans with burning questions and unsolved mysteries.
Fans are eager to know how Quirk Awakenings work, the true nature of Kamui Woods, and why Dr. Garaki was Deku&rsquo;s doctor.
Other mysteries include the creation of Gigantomachia, the identity of Deku&rsquo;s father, and the origins of Quirks in the series.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>My Hero Academia may be closing in on its finale, but there are still a lot of mysteries and unanswered questions that fans have been wondering about.</p>
<p>The My Hero Academia manga is in its final arc, and the end is coming for the popular superhero series. However, there are still a lot of questions that fans have and mysteries left in the story which, while unlikely to be answered in these last chapters, have left some fans burning for answers.
The mysteries of My Hero Academia range from the absence of certain characters to questions which, depending on the answer, could rock the very foundation of the series&rsquo; world. Some of them have been debated by fans for years, while others have only recently made themselves known as being unsolved. While some answers could potentially be slipped in before the manga&rsquo;s ending, fans shouldn&rsquo;t hold their breath on getting answers to most of these mysteries.</p>
<p>10  What Happened to Best Jeanist?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 299</p>
<p>At one point, following Best Jeanist&rsquo;s defeat by All for One in the Hideout Raid arc, Hawks goes to visit Best Jeanist, and is later shown turning over the hero&rsquo;s body to Dabi. This made it appear as if Hawks had killed Best Jeanist to ingratiate himself to the villains, but Best Jeanist was alive, and returned triumphantly at the climax of the Paranormal Liberation War. However, his body was in the villains&rsquo; custody for weeks&hellip; so how did he survive? Even a comatose patient would need a feeding tube to survive that long.
A bigger question might be, what did the villains do with his body during that time, and why did they want it in the first place?</p>
<p>9  What Exactly is Kamui Woods?
Relevant Chapter: Character Profile, Volume 10</p>
<p>In the character profile for Kamui Woods, it&rsquo;s explained that he had a very dark childhood, which became the subject of a documentary that was very popular in-universe. While he has a civilian name, his hero name means &ldquo;God of the Woods,&rdquo; and he has a very close association with nature. His body seems to be made of wood, so there&rsquo;s reason to question whether he&rsquo;s even human at all. His face and body are never seen, although it is known that he wears a mask. His age is a mystery, as he only &ldquo;started counting&rdquo; after he was found by (other?) humans.
Could Kamui Woods actually be some kind of nature spirit? After all, there are non-humans with Quirks (like Principal Nezu), so why not plants?</p>
<p>8  Why Was Dr. Garaki Deku&rsquo;s Doctor?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 1</p>
<p>In the very first chapter of My Hero Academia, the child Midoriya is taken to a doctor who specializes in Quirks, who confirms that Deku is Quirkless. However, this doctor isn&rsquo;t just some throwaway character; it later becomes apparent that the Doctor is in fact Kyudai Garaki, All for One&rsquo;s personal mad scientist and top supporter. Was this simply some sort of cover that Garaki had, or was there something more sinister at work here? After all, a position analyzing children for new Quirks would be incredibly valuable to All for One, allowing him to steal them with ease.
A once-popular fan theory even suspected that Garaki may have stolen Midoriya&rsquo;s birth Quirk, but this would&rsquo;ve surely come up by now in the manga if it were true. Still, his presence as Deku&rsquo;s doctor is highly questionable and sure to have fans speculating for years.</p>
<p>7  How Did Gigantomachia Come to Be?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 221</p>
<p>Gigantomachia is a massive villain several stories tall, who wields multiple Quirks given to him by All for One, to whom he is extremely loyal. It&rsquo;s known that having a large number of Quirks usually taxes the brain, explaining why Gigantomachia isn&rsquo;t too smart, but just how did Gigantomachia get to be the way he is? Was he an early take on a Nomu? Why did Gigantomachia allow himself to be transformed into the monstrous form he now has? Was it for power, or was it against his will? His birth Quirk Endurance seems to have played a role, but Garaki could clone it for use in other beings, if they wanted to make more.</p>
<p>6  Will Fans Meet Deku&rsquo;s Father?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 1</p>
<p>Deku&rsquo;s mother has played a role in the series, but his father hasn&rsquo;t appeared at all. Little is known about Deku&rsquo;s father; his name is Hisashi Midoriya, and he&rsquo;s said to have a fire-breathing Quirk, but that&rsquo;s about all that has been canonically established. He&rsquo;s supposedly working abroad, explaining his absence, but his lack of communication to either wife or son, despite the tragedies occurring in Japan, is almost unforgivable. Kohei Horikoshi, the creator of the series, once said back in 2018 that he&rsquo;d introduce Deku&rsquo;s father before the series ended, but there remains no sign of him.</p>
<p>5  Principal Nezu is Full of Mysteries
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 66</p>
<p>Principal Nezu is not, in fact, a human with a Quirk that makes him look like a mouse; instead, he&rsquo;s a real mouse with a super-intelligence Quirk. Nezu&rsquo;s past is said to be rather dark, and that he has something of a latent grudge against humans that came out when he was tasked with challenging the UA students, sadistically enjoying it. Nezu is also said to be fantastically wealthy as a result of his Quirk, and he reinvests these fortunes into the school. But just what is Nezu doing to earn such incredible sums of money, and what happened to him in the past? Was he experimented upon before being recognized as a person?</p>
<p>4  How Do Quirk Awakenings Work?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 226</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that on rare occasions, a person&rsquo;s Quirk can undergo an &ldquo;Awakening,&rdquo; becoming more powerful than it previously was. It seems that this requires intense life-or-death situations, as seen with Toga, who is the first in the series to undergo such an evolution of power. The series is full of life-or-death moments, however, and these only rarely result in an Awakening, so how exactly do Awakenings work? Can anyone undergo an Awakening? Aoyama proved that even those born Quirkless can undergo an Awakening, so it would seem that it&rsquo;s available to most people.
The ability to trigger Awakenings on demand would be incredibly powerful, and it&rsquo;s a shame more research hasn&rsquo;t been put into it in-universe.</p>
<p>3  How Were Nomu Created?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 283</p>
<p>The first Nomu known to be created was Kurogiri, who differs from other Nomu greatly, in that he still has some intelligence and will of his own. Kurogiri&rsquo;s origins were detailed somewhat in the spinoff series My Hero Academia Vigilantes, created from the deceased UA Student Oboro Shirakumo, around 15 years before the series is set. However, Nomu seem to be relatively new at the start of the series, since All Might and others are unfamiliar with them at the USJ. Did it take a long time to perfect the Nomu? Gigantomachia was something of an inspiration for their creation, but how and why did they move to using dead bodies as Nomu bases?</p>
<p>2  Where is the &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; User?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 59</p>
<p>One for All harbors within it the spirits of those who held the Quirk before Deku&hellip; except for one. One for All was created when All for One gave a power stockpiling Quirk to his younger brother Yoichi, which merged with an unknown Quirk inside him which was capable of being passed on, but nothing more. Yoichi&rsquo;s vestige appears in One for All, but the original owner of the power stockpiling Quirk has never been revealed. It&rsquo;s possible this person gave their Quirk to All for One willingly, so perhaps they&rsquo;re not interested in fighting him.
It may also be that the vestige was lost when the two Quirks merged into One for All, but none of this has been addressed in the series.</p>
<p>1  Why Did Quirks Appear?
Relevant Chapter: Chapter 407</p>
<p>According to history, the first Quirk user born was the Luminiscent Baby in China, but All for One&rsquo;s past revealed that his mother was already exhibiting signs of a Quirk even before the baby was born. In chapter 158, it&rsquo;s posited that a virus transmitted by mice was the origin of Quirks, but there is no evidence of this virus&rsquo;s existence. It&rsquo;s clear that the Luminiscent Baby just happened to be the first obvious case, and the weakness of Quirks in the early days made them harder to notice. It seems to have emerged around the world all at once, so how exactly did this happen, and where do Quirks come from?
My Hero Academia fans may be left wondering about the answers to these questions for some time to come, but if answers are ever to be had, they need to come soon, before the manga ends.

<p>My Hero Academia<br>
Action
Superhero
Animation</p>
<p>In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &ldquo;One-For-All&rdquo; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.</p>
