## Literature Review

A good anime can make any topic fascinating, no matter how niche it is, and these shows prove it by transforming obscure topics into great stories.




While most popular anime focus on topics that general audiences enjoy such as epic fights or relatable human drama, a select few can also make incredibly niche topics fascinating as well. These shows may often seem like a burden to get invested in for those who haven&#39;t seen them, but by using compelling storytelling techniques these anime can show their viewers why they should care about whatever topic they cover. In doing so they prove that a great story can truly be about anything as long as it is told well.
Of course, the exact definition of &#34;niche&#34; will vary from person to person based on their tastes and viewing experience. A major Shonen action fan for example may find a slice of life or sports anime boring given their lack of magical powers and fights. In addition, an anime fan who also paints as a hobby may find a show like Blue Period naturally more compelling than someone who has never created art. In general, though, the anime on this list will only try to focus on truly obscure things, so while volleyball may not be the most popular sport, that won&#39;t qualify the great sports anime Haikyu!! making it on this list. Here are the ten anime that have best covered some of the most niche topics around.









 








 10  Shirobako 
        

Given how mainstream anime has become in recent years, it may seem weird to place Shirobako, a series about a group of friends working in the anime industry, on this list. However, while anime is popular, many people don&#39;t care about the nitty-gritty details concerning how it is made. Although Shirobako doesn&#39;t dive into the darker parts of the anime industry like the one Paranoia Agent episode focusing on an anime studio, it does give a very educational and fascinating look at what it actually takes to make the anime that fans often take for granted.





 9  Bakuman 
        

Like with Shirobako, it may seem weird to place a show about making manga on a list focusing on niche topics given the rising popularity of the art form. Bakuman definitely deserves a spot here though, as the anime following an artist and writer who team up to become the best mangaka in Japan gives outsiders a fascinating glance into the industry that produces some of their favorite stories. It also shows the personal workload that manga creators have to take on and the stress that can be placed on them. But ultimately it is a celebration of the creative process for a manga that will get any viewer invested in the success of its two heroes.





 8  Your Lie in April 
        

Most fans remember Your Lie in April for the emotional scars it leaves on its viewers, but it is also a loving ode to the power of classical music. Focusing on Kosei Arima, a child piano prodigy who has given up the instrument due to a mental block, it shows his growing relationship with a violinist named Kaori. Kaori helps reinvigorate his love of music while at the same time showing the audience what makes this genre often perceived as boring actually incredibly touching.

 7  Ping Pong 
        

Ping Pong is a meditation on greatness told through a story on a sport many people don&#39;t even consider such. However, most of Ping Pong&#39;s fascinating cast of characters consider it as a high form of competition, and the sense of tension they feel in their matches transfers to the viewers as well. The unique art style also serves the dynamic nature of the Ping Pong matches well, providing beautifully expressive animation at the peak of the action. All this makes Ping Pong an incredibly unique experience that viewers are not likely to forget and likely one that will make them never see table tennis in the same way.





 6  Yuri!!! On Ice 
        

What most fans remember about Yuri!!! On Ice is the great strides it made for LGBTQ representation in anime by depicting a romantic relationship between two men (even if it frustratingly avoided showing them kissing directly). However, it was also a great showcase of what makes figure skating both beautiful and compelling. The show made every figure skating performance a mesmerizing dance with stunning animation that fully conveyed the grace and expertise of the skaters. This caused many viewers to become as invested in the niche sport as the skaters who spent so much time in the show making their performances perfect.





 5  Hikaru no Go 
        

Go is an ancient Chinese strategy game that is akin to chess although much less known in the West. Hikaru no Go is a story about a boy named Hikaru who finds a Go board possessed by the ghost of a master of the game from the Heian period named Sai. Sai helps Hikaru defeat powerful opponents at the game and the boy develops a passion for the sport. Despite the game&#39;s complexity, the anime still makes it fascinating to watch, and viewers quickly become invested in each game, which becomes as intense as the best fights in other more typical Shonen series.





 4  March Comes in Like a Lion 
        

March Comes in Like a Lion is another anime that features a sport that is relatively unknown in the West but can quickly get viewers invested in it regardless. That game is Shogi, which is essentially a Japanese version of chess with some key differences. It focuses on a young professional Shogi player named Rei who struggles with depression and various other personal issues. While the main focus of the show is the drama that goes on with Rei and the other characters, watching them play Shogi it is hard not to become fascinated with the complicated game.





 3  The Great Passage 
        

The Great Passage is a series that at first may seem impenetrable to a Western anime fan who isn&#39;t intimately familiar with Japanese. It follows a group of characters making a comprehensive dictionary of the Japanese language. This may sound incredibly boring, but the charming characters keep viewers watching until they too are invested in the creation of this dictionary. The anime not only somehow gets viewers invested in the rarely considered job of dictionary editors, but it also proves how powerful words in general can be a love letter to language in general.





 2  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu 
        

Rakugo is a performance art unique to Japan in which a seated solo performer tells one of a set of stock stories to an audience without props. All of this may make it sound boring, but Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu shows how compelling an art form it can be. The show tells the story of Yakumo, an aging Rakugo who is training a new apprentice. The dramatic lives of these characters and how they relate to their performances are incredibly compelling, but what makes the Rakugo sections of the show riveting are the incredible performances, both from an acting and animation perspective. With new manga like Akane-banashi focusing on Rakugo as well, there may be even more shows focused on this niche in the future.





 1  Chihayafuru 
        

Like some of the previous entries on this list, Chihayafuru focuses on an obscure sport. However, this time the sport in question, Karuta, is barely viewed as a sport by Japanese society at large. It is a memorization card game based on a set of old Japanese poems, which may sound dull. However, seeing the passion of the diverse characters who play it can&#39;t help but get the viewers invested in it. The dynamic and intense way the games are presented also makes them feel as exciting as a typical Shonen battle. The true charm of this show however is its exploration of being devoted to something most people don&#39;t value, which makes it only fitting that it tops this list.
Each of these shows is proof that anime and manga can make anything compelling. They also show not to judge a show just by its premise, as they are often about much more than just the niche subject they focus on. Hopefully, these 10 best anime focusing on niche subjects have made their topics fascinating enough to promote more interest in them among their viewers.
