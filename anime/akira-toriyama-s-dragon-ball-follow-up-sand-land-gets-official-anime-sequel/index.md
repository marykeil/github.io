The film adaptation of Akira Toriyama’s Sand Land was recently released in Japan, and it’s set to receive an official anime sequel. Sand Land was one of Akira Toriyama’s few serialized stories following the end of Dragon Ball, and it’s maintained a cult following for over 20 years. The story was recently adapted into a CG film, and the Sand Land film has been met with praise from fans and critics alike.




Sand Land’s film adaptation isn’t set to release in the West until 2024, and in that same year, it’s also set to receive an official anime sequel. In addition to seeing the return of all the cast and crew from the film, the Sand Land anime will redo the story with scenes that weren’t in the film and tell an original story created by Akira Toriyama, himself.

 When &amp; Where Will Sand Land’s Anime Be Released? 
          

With Sand Land set to receive an anime, that invites the question of when and where the series will ultimately be released. At the moment, nothing has been revealed for Sand Land’s release date outside of a 2024 window, and since it’s set to be released on Disney&#43; in Japan, that most likely means that it will be released on Hulu in the United States and other Western territories. It should be noted that Jump Festa, Shueisha’s annual convention dedicated to new announcements for their various properties, is set to start on December 16, so it’s likely that more information will be revealed then.

 Akira Toriyama’s Involvement Will Be Great For The Sand Land Anime 
          

At the moment, it’s unknown how the Sand Land anime will play out, but it’s very likely to be great because of one key factor: Akira Toriyama. In addition to the stellar writing Toriyama used for the original story, with Akira Toriyama confirmed to be writing the sequel story for the anime, not only will it be of consistent quality with the original, but it’ll elevate the series to even greater heights with how much Toriyama’s advanced his craft over the past 23 years. That leaves a lot to be excited about for the anime, and it’s bound to end up as one of the best anime of 2024.

The idea of Akira Toriyama’s involvement being a boon for production is best expressed, of course, with his recent involvement in Dragon Ball. Toriyama has been heavily involved with every Dragon Ball story to come out in the past decade, including the upcoming Dragon Ball DAIMA, which also releases in 2024, and they’ve all excelled at taking Dragon Ball to new heights while still maintaining the charm of the original series. If Akira Toriyama can do that with Dragon Ball, then he can also be expected to do that with Sand Land, and that’ll be great to see when it finally releases in 2024.
