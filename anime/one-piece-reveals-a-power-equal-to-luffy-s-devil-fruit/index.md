# One Piece Reveals A Power Equal To Luffy s Devil Fruit


## SUMMARY 



  Bonney&#39;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as Luffy&#39;s, limited by her imagination and ability to visualize different futures.   Bonney&#39;s power weakens when faced with reality, and when she doubts other possible fates, hindering her ability to maintain her transformed state.   Bonney hasn&#39;t yet made the connection between Luffy&#39;s Gear Five Form and Nika, but once she does, her faith in Nika will be renewed, and she will be able to use her devil fruit more confidently.

Summary

  Bonney&#39;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as Luffy&#39;s, limited by her imagination and ability to visualize different futures.   Bonney&#39;s power weakens when faced with reality, and when she doubts other possible fates, hindering her ability to maintain her transformed state.   Bonney hasn&#39;t yet made the connection between Luffy&#39;s Gear Five Form and Nika, but once she does, her faith in Nika will be renewed, and she will be able to use her devil fruit more confidently.  







Mind-boggling as the powers of Luffy&#39;s devil fruit may be, One Piece has just confirmed that there may be one power that could be its equal. The latest chapter of One Piece confirms Bonney&#39;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as fans believed, and the possibility of her realizing its full potential only raises the excitement for the grand climax of the Egghead Arc.

In chapter #1103 of One Piece, Saint Saturn confirms that Bonney&#39;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as Luffy&#39;s, limited solely by her imagination, just like the Nika fruit. Saturn reveals that the Age-Age Fruit gives Bonney the power to transform into any form she sees as a possible future, confirming that her Distorted Future ability may be just as fearsome as fans speculated.

          




Having said that, despite their similarities, Bonney&#39;s devil fruit comes with one major hurdle that could prevent her from reaching the heights that the Nika fruit can. In fact, the Age-Age Fruit&#39;s biggest strength may ironically be its biggest weakness as well

                  One Piece Reveals One Of The Strongest Devil Fruits Seen Yet   One Piece revealed that Bartholomew Kuma&#39;s Devil Fruit may have had some of the most insane powers in the entire series up until now.   


 Saint Saturn Confirms the True Power of Bonney&#39;s Devil Fruit 
          

Saint Saturn&#39;s description of Bonney&#39;s devil fruit in chapter #1103 strongly matches that of Luffy, which was also described by the Five Elders as being limited by its user&#39;s imagination. This revelation suggests that Bonney&#39;s devil fruit can alter reality itself just like the Nika fruit can, if not to an even greater extent. That said, along with Saturn&#39;s confirmation of the Age-Age Fruit&#39;s true power, the latest chapter also presents what may be its biggest weakness.




Simple as it sounds, Bonney&#39;s ability depends entirely on her ability to imagine different futures for herself and the amount of faith she has in the likelihood of these alternative futures. As Saturn explains, Bonney&#39;s powers weaken when she is faced with reality and is unable to visualize any other fate for herself. This is seen when Bonney is unable to remain in her Nika form after attacking Saturn, as she begins to doubt Nika&#39;s existence, as Saturn promptly points out.

                  One Piece Confirms a Big Fan Theory About an Important Pirate   One Piece&#39;s Egghead adventure basically confirmed that fans have been right on the money about Jewelry Bonney and her true age.   



 Bonney Hasn&#39;t Made the Connection Between Nika and Luffy 
          

Fortunately, Bonney may be able to overcome this particular drawback of her devil fruit rather effortlessly. Though Kuma may have already made the connection, Bonney is yet to make the connection between Luffy&#39;s Gear Five Form and Sun God Nika, as Saturn also notices in chapter #1103. While she may have doubts at present, Bonney&#39;s faith in Nika will likely be instantly renewed once she realizes that Luffy is Nika, or at least wields the same power as the legendary warrior, allowing her to resume her Nika form with even greater enthusiasm. Watching Luffy fight as Nika could also inspire Bonney&#39;s imagination further, allowing her to use her ability just as freely as Luffy.




          

Overall, Bonney&#39;s devil fruit is quickly establishing itself as quite a formidable power, one that might even be considered among the strongest devil fruits in One Piece. As things stand, Bonney may even end up being the next to join the Straw Hats&#39; group of misfits on their adventure.
