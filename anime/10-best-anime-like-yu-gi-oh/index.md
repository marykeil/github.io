 10  Beyblade&#39;s Anime Promotes Its Own Toy Line 
TV Tokyo, based on the manga by Takao Aoki


 







Tyson Granger’s grandfather would prefer that he run the family dojo, but he approves of the warrior’s zeal with which Tyson battles with his Beyblade. Tyson&#39;s team are determined to conquer the tournament circuit. They soon find themselves the only ones who can defend their sacred bit-beasts and the sport of Beyblade itself.
Its first anime premiered in 2001, just a year after Yu-Gi-Oh!’s anime. Beyblade also became popular through the tie-in game and collectible toys, though it takes more practice for real Beyblade players to let the flashy tops rip. It still goes strong today with sequel series, such as the currently airing Beyblade X.

In addition to the many competitions available to Trainers and Coordinators, Pokémon are also a major part of the workforce: just ask all the Chanseys at the Pokémon Centers and Growlithes in the police! Legendary Pokémon control the elements, time and space, and the fabric of the universe itself.

Hunter X Hunter also had a 1999 anime adaptation, though it covers less of the manga.

Yu-Gi-Oh! joins Duel Monsters with virtual reality many times in the same way. In Greed Island, players use cards to store items, learn spells, and battle other players. The object of the game is to collect all 100 cards, at which point the winner will be able to bring three cards of their choice from the game into the real world.

TMS Entertainment, based on the franchise owned by Sega Toys and Spin Masters
