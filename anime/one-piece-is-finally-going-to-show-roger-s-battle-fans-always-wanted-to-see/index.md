Summary

  The God Valley Incident, a historic battle between Vice Admiral Garp and Pirate King Gol D. Roger against the Rocks Pirates, is finally being explored in One Piece&#39;s manga.   The flashback reveals that God Valley was the site of a manhunt by the Celestial Dragons, making them even more despicable in the eyes of readers.   The upcoming clash between the heroic Garp and Roger and the supposedly villainous Rocks Pirates raises questions about morality and the potential destruction of One Piece&#39;s strongest pirate crew.  







One Piece&#39;s manga is finally exploring the God Valley Incident, which includes Roger and Garp&#39;s epic team-up to take on the Rocks Pirates. The Egghead arc has gone beyond the title Island, covering the actual events of the Reverie, Garp&#39;s attempted rescue of Koby, and many other revelations that have delighted fans. However, author Eiichiro Oda may have been only warming up for the anticipated God Valley flashback.

Immediately after revealing the tragic past of One Piece&#39;s Kuma, chapter #1095 shifted to the legendary God Valley island. Thirty-eight years ago, the island hosted one of the series&#39; most important battles that changed the world&#39;s balance of power forever.

          

 Very few know exactly what happened during the God Valley Incident, especially since the island was wiped off the map. However, the flashback is beginning to show what occurred on the day that&#39;s been erased from One Piece&#39;s history books. What is known is that Vice Admiral Garp teamed up with future Pirate King Gol D. Roger to defeat history&#39;s most feared Pirate crew, the Rocks Pirates. More is finally about to be revealed in the manga.





 One Piece Is Finally Getting To Roger And Garp&#39;s Fight Against Rocks 
          

The God Valley Incident and the fate of Rocks D. Xebec have been two of One Piece&#39;s biggest mysteries since Sengoku shared the tale with high-ranking marines in chapter #957. Citizens worldwide were told that Vice Admiral Garp stopped the Rocks crew&#39;s evil rampage, but what wasn&#39;t shared was that the Navy and the Roger Pirates teamed up to defeat the Rock Pirates and supposedly killed Xebec. Chapter #1095 marked the beginning of the anticipated flashback that should finally see Roger and Garp&#39;s fight against One Piece&#39;s strongest Pirate crew, made up of powerhouse characters like Kaido, Big Mom, and Whitebeard. However, with more context, it&#39;s become unclear who the heroes and villains were during the incident.

Celestial Dragons have been portrayed as the vilest of humans throughout One Piece&#39;s story, but Oda managed to make them even worse in #1095. God Valley involuntarily became the venue for the World Noble&#39;s customary manhunt, which saw the series&#39; evil oppressors hunting slaves and the island&#39;s citizens for sport. The chapter ends with a newly orphaned Kuma attempting to escape and then being rescued by a young Emporio Ivankov. However, thanks to former Fleet Admiral Sengoku, fans know that God Valley is about to host a clash with many of One Piece&#39;s most legendary characters.






 The Destruction Of One Piece&#39;s Strongest Pirate Crew Is Near 
          

After learning about the Celestial Dragons&#39; disturbing manhunt on God Valley, it becomes surprisingly easy to root for the Rocks Pirates, who are supposed to be the bad guys. Garp and Roger have been shown to represent a very different code of morality than the Noble&#39;s, so it will be interesting to see in future chapters how the two get stuck in a position where they must defend the Celestial Dragons&#39; heinous slaughter of innocents on the island. Either way, if the battle between Roger, Garp, and Rocks erupts during this flashback, One Piece&#39;s Egghead Island arc seems poised to host even more monumental battles than the previous Wano arc.
