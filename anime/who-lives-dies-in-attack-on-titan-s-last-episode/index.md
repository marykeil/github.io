## Literature Review

Not surprisingly, Attack On Titan&#39;s final episode kills off at least one major character but there are also some notable survivors.




Warning: SPOILERS for Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2The last episode of Attack On Titan has just been released, and as expected not all the main characters of the series survived the epic final battle. In addition to the obvious difficulty of traversing the world and defeating the colossal Titans, the heroes also had to confront their friend Eren, now fully committed to destroying the world outside of Paradis Island.




Hajime Isayama is known for killing off popular characters to advance the story, and previous seasons have featured the heartbreaking deaths of some of the most beloved characters such as Erwin and Hange. Given the scale of the battle against Eren, many fans expected a similar outcome, but surprisingly, the casualties among the main cast were not as high as anticipated.

                  Attack on Titan Ending Explained   After running for a decade, Attack on Titan&#39;s anime finally comes to an end, and here&#39;s everything about the ending explained in full detail.   


 The Main Character Meets His End 
         

Eren was not willing to negotiate a surrender, and the only option that was left was to kill him. The Scouts marched into the battlefield, all except Armin and Mikasa giving up hope of a truce and determined to put him to rest. In a surprising turn of events, Mikasa was the one to take Eren&#39;s life. This was a fitting death for Eren, as the person he loved the most was the one to put a stop to his insane plans. It&#39;s not common for the main character of a series to die, but it has worked in different anime. This was the biggest and most shocking death in the episode, but it was more or less anticipated after Eren wiped out 80 percent of the world&#39;s population.




After that, meeting his friends for the final time in the Paths dimension, Eren reveals that his plan was to make Armin and everyone else heroes for defeating him and earn enough respect to protect Paradis Island. He also reveals that everything that happened was predetermined by his visions of the future, and his goal was to free Ymir Fritz from her love for King Fritz, thus ending the Titan threat.



 Zeke Accepts His Fate 
          

Zeke was a monumental character in the series and was a key player in the unfolding of the events, but he just had to go. Eren used him to activate the Rumbling, and as long as he was alive more people would die. Although his death was devastating, he went out on his terms and as a hero. He surrendered himself and called out to Levi, whom he had escaped from multiple times, to come and finish the job. With a swift slash, Levi decapitated Zeke and released himself from his nightmare.






 Ymir Is Freed From Her Chains 
          

Ymir had been following the Fritz Family&#39;s orders for 2000 years until she was finally able to find release with Mikasa&#39;s help, leading to the end of the Titans&#39; age and the inability of Eldians to become Titans. Ymir&#39;s story is the saddest of them all. King Fritz killed her family and everyone she loved, and despite gaining immense power, she was powerless to do anything. It was finally explained why she remained loyal to the king who had done such terrible things to her: love. She fell for the evil king and thus obeyed all of his descendants. She finally broke free from the curse and found peace.



 Mikasa Is The Main Hero Of The Episode 
          




Mikasa managed to survive the deadly battle, although there were several moments where she and everyone else were about to die. The thought of killing Eren, the man she grew up with and loved, broke her but Mikasa was able to overcome her feelings and do what had to be done for the greater good. With one final push, with the help of Armin and Levi, she went inside the Attack Titan&#39;s jaw and cut off Eren&#39;s head. She took Eren&#39;s decapitated head back to Paradis and buried it in one of his favorite spots growing up. She went on to live a long and peaceful life in the district she grew up in.



 Levi Escaped The Jaws Of Death 
          

Even before the final battle, Levi was in terrible shape and was missing three fingers and an eye. Recovering from an explosion that left him half-dead, he went on to fight through the pain. His contributions were immense. He killed Zeke, saved Conny, and aided Mikasa in delivering the final blow. Although he survived, he lost the ability to walk and ended up wheelchair-bound, becoming a volunteer and helping the survivors. After years of intense battle and losing many friends, nobody deserved a break more than Levi Ackerman.






 Armin Helped In The Peace Efforts 
          

Armin, as the new commander of the Scout Regiment, had a crucial task ahead of him. Despite the difficulty of the decision, he came to the conclusion that Eren&#39;s death was necessary. Although he was once abducted by Ymir&#39;s Titans, he was later rescued and transformed into the Colossal Titan to face Eren in his largest and final form. After securing the victory, he became an ambassador for the Allied Nations and journeyed to Paradis to finally put an end to a conflict that had spanned hundreds of years. With a long life ahead of him, he is determined to usher in a new era of peace and make amends for his past misdeeds.



 The Heroes Lived To See Another Day 
          




Miraculously, there were no deaths among the remaining members of the Scouts. There were a lot of close moments where it seemed like Conny, Reiner, and Pieck were about to die, but they were able to live on. Annie, Jean, Colt, Gabi, and Onyakopon all came out alive and went about their lives after the incident. Together with Armin, Reiner, Jean, Conny, Pieck, and Annie they became representatives and worked hard to negotiate peace. They became known as heroes in the Battle Between Heaven And Earth.

What seemed like an episode that would feature tragedy turned out to have a happy ending, at least for the main cast. Attack On Titan has been known to make its characters go through horrible experiences, so the fact that it all worked out was refreshing and fans were at peace with the ending, at least until the end credits started rolling. It turns out that Paradis Island will be bombed to ruins at some point in the future, showing that despite Eren and Armin’s best efforts, the cycle of violence didn&#39;t end. The final scene is the same as the infamous one from the manga, showing a boy in the destroyed Paradis discovering the tree Eren was buried under, implying that he will gain Titan powers, thus reigniting the cycle of hatred.




Despite keeping the controversial ending of the manga, the final episode of Attack On Titan exceeded expectations and is a great closure for one of the best anime of all time.
