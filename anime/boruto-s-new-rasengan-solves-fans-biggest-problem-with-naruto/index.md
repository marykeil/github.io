## Literature Review

Despite having some of the most evil villains in manga, Naruto always found a way to rehabilitate them. Fortunately, Boruto fixes this issue.




While the latest chapter of Boruto provided enough sensational ninja action to remind readers that it is the worthy sequel of the Naruto franchise, it also served to quiet one of the longest-running critiques of the parent series, namely that it was way too soft on the degree of evilness its villains exhibited.




While Naruto is one of the most beloved manga in pop culture history, it&#39;s amazing that it achieved such an over-the-top status by ignoring one of the genre&#39;s most fan-favorite elements - the irredeemable villain. To be sure, Naruto&#39;s preference for the &#34;broken villain who can be fixed&#34; became an ongoing negative marker for more than a few fans of the series, and it also inspired countless other manga that followed.

          

An interesting update to the franchise, however, finally fulfills the promise of Boruto (Part I) being Naruto&#39;s sequel by updating its &#34;redeemable villain&#34; problem. In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #3 Boruto uses his newfound Rasengan abilities to put long-time villain and existential threat Code one step short of meeting his maker.





 Boruto Is Ready To Kill His Villains 
          

Considering the history of the franchise&#39;s custom of taking a sympathetic progression towards its villains, the alacrity with which Boruto moves from winning the fight to deciding to kill Code is amazing. That is, Code is given no time to redeem himself or show why he is simply imperfect rather than permanently and completely evil. Indeed, there&#39;s a reasonable argument why fans are uneasy with villains as depraved as Orochimaru, Pain, or even child-stealing Amado getting rehabilitated as fellows who, having acknowledged their mistakes, should be given a second chance to be a model citizen.

Although Code is ultimately not killed - using the arrival of Kawaki on the scene to transport himself back to his hideout - the circumstances are not the same as with a villain escaping death in Naruto. The fundamental difference in Two Blue Vortex is Boruto&#39;s mindset. For all intents and purposes, if Code doesn&#39;t give him the information he wants regarding the Ten Tails Beast, Boruto really seems intent on summarily ending his life on the spot. In fact, if his newly upgraded Rasengan is all that he says it is, Boruto has already killed Code. According to Boruto, once he&#39;s hit Code with Rasengan Uzuhiko, unless he reverses the process, the villain will die at some point in the future.




                  Boruto&#39;s New Rasengan Is Inspired By Another Classic Shonen   Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #3 has revealed the power of Rasengan Uzuhiko, and it takes clear inspiration from a classic shonen manga.   



 Naruto&#39;s Trend Of Redeeming Villains Is Over 
          

Boruto&#39;s ruthless attitude toward villains lies in stark contrast to Naruto&#39;s modus operandi in similar situations. No matter how much hurt, harm, and death a villain might have caused or facilitated in their efforts to achieve misguided goals, Nauto was always able to find some good or otherwise redeeming quality that allowed them to turn towards the light and, at times, do a good that overcomes the pain they originally caused. For instance, for all the harm Sasuke caused Naruto personally, and the Konoha community in general, Naruto nevertheless risked his own life and limb to save him time and again.




The constant rehabilitation of villains in Naruto, while arguably making them more popular with the fan base, also created some controversy. The overall effect of not having an irredeemable villain was to make the story too focused on grey morals, which at some point hurt its realism. Fortunately, by allowing its main character to be ruthless and willing to kill, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex solves Naruto&#39;s &#34;redeemable villains&#34; problem, and in doing so makes the story much more interesting.

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is now available from Viz Media
