## SUMMARY 



  Squid Girl is a shining example of a well-localized anime, with an English script that effectively translates the humor of the original Japanese script to an English audience.   The translation and localization process in anime has a history of bad examples, with 90s dubs changing names, censoring content, and removing episodes.

## Literature Review

Squid Girl&#39;s English script is a great example of remaining true to the original while letting the humor shine in a different language.




One oddball classic slice-of-life anime is a masterpiece of good translation and localization. The English script of Squid Girl is remarkable for how well it balances remaining true to the humor of the original Japanese, while translating that humor both linguistically and culturally to land with an English-language audience.




Translation and localization is always a delicate process. In anime especially, there are countless examples of bad translations. 90s anime dubs were infamous for freely changing names, censoring content that was deemed inappropriate, and even removing entire episodes. Translators have adopted a policy of being significantly more faithful to the original scripts in recent years, but challenges remain for translators. Jokes, especially wordplay and puns, are notorious difficult to translate well between languages and cultures.

Luckily, Squid Girl is a shining example of how to localize anime well. Much of the series&#39; humor comes from Squid Girl&#39;s everyday life on the surface, working at a waitress at a seaside restaurant as a very literal fish out of water. The humor of the premise is enhanced by the constant wordplay and puns from the characters that has been masterfully translated in the English version.




In the original Japanese version, Squid Girl has a distinct verbal tic of including the phrase &#34;de geso&#34; in most of her lines. It&#39;s a pun based around Japanese grammar and the Japanese word for &#34;squid&#34;. It&#39;s hard just to explain the joke in English, so the translators were always joining to have an uphill battle to make the joke actually funny in English. The translators&#39; solution was to drop that one specific joke, while maintaining the premise of Squid Girl&#39;s speech containing a lot of fish puns.

          

Instead of having one specific verbal tic, the English version of Squid Girl&#39;s dialogue is filled with other oceanic puns. Her quickly abandoned plan to take over the surface world is her &#34;ink-vasion&#34;, she &#34;gets kraken&#34;, and uses a lot of words that rhyme with &#34;squid&#34; and &#34;fish.&#34; A vocabulary so heavily based in fish puns really plays up the English version of Squid Girl&#39;s nature as a denizen of the sea, which in turn really highlights the contrast between a non-human character like Squid Girl and the mundane, everyday nature of the setting and helps the everyday, slice-of-life humor to shine.




Sometimes, a good translation requires changing the letter of the original script to capture the spirit of the original script. Squid Girl&#39;s English dub is a slice-of-life anime classic and a great example of the benefits of a good localization.
