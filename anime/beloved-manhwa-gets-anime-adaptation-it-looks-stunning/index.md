As described by Crunchyroll, the synopsis for the anime adaptation of True Beauty is as follows:



Jugyeong, who transformed herself with makeup, transfers to Saebom High School to leave her past of being bullied behind. The school is known for producing idols, actors, and influencers, thanks to its unique tradition of anonymous voting for the schoolâ€™s True Beauty goddess. The chosen student gets scouted by entertainment agencies.


Jugyeong quickly becomes the center of attention, gaining the title of the next goddess candidate and mingling with Sujin, the former two-time goddess. However, Sujin&#39;s friendly facade hides a malicious intent. She aims to bring Jugyeong down using cunning tactics and traps.


Determined not to be a victim again, Jugyeong confronts Sujin, vowing to become the next goddess. She engages in a fierce voting war while concealing her makeup-free face. However, things take unexpected turns when Suho Lee, the school&#39;s heartthrob, accidentally sees her bare face, and Jugyeong crosses paths with the enigmatic SeoJun Han, who is determined to unveil her true identity.


As Jugyeong&#39;s life becomes more entangled with these two, a thrilling tale of beauty, intrigue, and self-discovery unfolds. Will Jugyeong conquer it all or succumb to the pressures of the beauty-obsessed world around her? Dive into the world of &#34;True Beauty&#34; and let the drama unfold!







Based on the description, it seems as though the anime will be following the plot of the original web comic closely. Crunchyroll also unveiled a key visual for the series, which highlights the character designs for Jukyung Lim, Lee Su-ho, and Han Seo-jun. The anime will be produced by Studio N, a subsidiary of Webtoon in South Korea, well-known for producing the live action adaptation of True Beauty as well as other series, such as Sweet Home and Hell Is Other People.

          

While True Beauty is far from the first manhwa to receive an anime adaption, with series like Tower of God and The God of High School receiving plenty of attention from anime fans, it&#39;s a welcome addition to Crunchyroll&#39;s growing collection of web comic adaptations, especially for fans of romance anime. Additionally, the art style chosen for the anime, while differing slightly from the original comic&#39;s unique style that blends realism and more animated expressions, is colorful and charming, which makes the series look fresh for fans of the original comic, as well as new fans who will be experiencing True Beauty for the first time. While there is currently no official release date, True Beauty is set to begin streaming on Crunchyroll some time in 2024.
