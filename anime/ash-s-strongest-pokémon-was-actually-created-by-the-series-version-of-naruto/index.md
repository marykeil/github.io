## Literature Review

Ash and his Pokémon have been through a lot of training, but one of the most important training sessions was with a Naruto-inspired Ninja.





In the episode &#34;A Rush of Ninja Wisdom!&#34;, Ash and his friends encounter a boy dressed as a ninja named Sanpei, who happens to have a Frogadier, Froakie&#39;s middle evolution. Ash and Sanpei battle, but Froakie ends up losing, which prompts Ash to ask Sanpei for help training his Froakie to be like Frogadier. Sanpei agrees and begins to teach Froakie some essential ninja tricks, like running across the surface of the water and flying through the treetops, just like in Naruto. While it takes Froakie a little time, it does eventually learn how to perform these abilities, which it would go on to use as the series continues.

 Ash&#39;s Froakie&#39;s Ninja Training Was Essential In Pokémon 
          

Through its ninja training, Froakie ultimately learns the move &#34;Double Team,&#34; which is known in Japanese as &#34;Shadow Divide&#34;, which sounds a lot like Naruto&#39;s Shadow Clones jutsu. Double Team becomes an essential tool in Froakie&#39;s moveset, maintaining it as it evolves, and it comes in clutch in some later episodes, such as in &#34;A Riveting Rivalry!&#34;, where Greninja is able to use the power of its Double Team clones to increase the attack of its Water Shuriken. For a one-off, character-of-the-day episode, this ninja called Sanpei is actually pretty important in Froakie&#39;s arc throughout XY, if only because of Double Team.

This encounter may also have played a role in Froakie&#39;s greater arc in a different sense. This is the first time that Froakie meets its evolved form, and while there&#39;s a bit of rivalry at first, Froakie respects Frogadier and does work to emulate it. Having seen what its evolved form can do may have made Froakie more open to the concept of evolving, paving the way for it to eventually become Greninja. Training experiences like this are also key to the bond building between Ash and Froakie, as Ash attempts this ninja training as well (to mixed results). The incredible bond that Ash and Froakie forge is what will ultimately allow the Pokémon to manifest the Ash-Greninja state, and this early training experience helped set them on the right path.






 Ninjas Have Always Existed In The Pokémon World 
          

It&#39;s quite fitting that the key to Froakie&#39;s success was actual ninja training, brought to him by a character who looks straight out of Naruto. The episode has a lot of fun with its references to the popular series, having Pikachu and others dress in ninja garb, and having Sanpei come from a secretive village, aiming to be the greatest ninja. Ninjas have actually played a role in the Pokémon world going all the way back to Kanto gym leader Koga in the first generation, so having actual ninjas for Froakie to train with is hardly a stretch. Ash&#39;s Froakie&#39;s training here is what built the foundation for everything the Pokémon would do later, making this an important experience besides a cool nod to Naruto.
