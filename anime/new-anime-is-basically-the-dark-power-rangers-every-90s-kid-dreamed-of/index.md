# New Anime is Basically the Dark Power Rangers Every 90s Kid Dreamed Of


## SUMMARY 



  Go! Go! Loser Ranger! is a darker, more pessimistic take on the Super Sentai genre, providing a fresh perspective for Power Rangers fans.   The anime adaptation of Negi Haruba&#39;s manga is highly anticipated by fans of both Power Rangers and Super Sentai.   The manga not only pokes fun at the Power Rangers franchise but also offers a deep and interesting story that delves into familiar tropes.

## Literature Review

In an upcoming new anime, fans go behind the scenes of the Keeper Corps as a cell of Dark Rangers seeks to destroy the organization from within.




In Kodansha&#39;s Go! Go! Loser Ranger!, that universe&#39;s version of the evil space alien army changes the traditional fight Power Ranger and lose dynamic by doing the unthinkable. While Power Rangers and the Super Sentai franchise its based on are traditionally lighthearted stories, Go! Go! Loser Ranger takes a look at the darker notes underlying the genre.




Negi Haruba&#39;s quietly excellent manga Go! Go! Loser Ranger! is being adapted into an anime. Announced last December, the brilliant reinterpretation of the groundbreaking Mighty Morphin&#39; Power Rangers franchise (or more accurately the Super Sentai series it is based on) is set to bring the hit manga to the small screen soon.


 

Judging from the manga, and the first teaser trailer, this is an anime that Power Rangers fans in general, and Super Sentai genre fans in specific, will not want to miss.

The Keiichi Sato anime adaptation of the Haruba manga begins with a classic Super Sentai premise featuring a team of high-functioning teenagers who gain superpowers via a morphing device that they use to protect the world from evil aliens. Loser Ranger, however, flips the script on that traditional story. In Loser Ranger, the tone is decidedly darker and the feel much more pessimistic. It&#39;s exactly the type of Dark Ranger story Super Sentai and Power Rangers fans have wanted for years and why evil Tommy Oliver&#39;s Lord Drakkon is such a popular character in the Power Rangers&#39; franchise

Loser Ranger focuses on three alternative perspectives. First is the perspective of an alien goon named Foot Soldier D who is tired of losing to the Rangers and infiltrates the Ranger Corps to win by sabotage. The second perspective is Yumeko Suzukiri, a disgruntled lower-level Ranger angered by how the Ranger Corps operates. Yumeko decides to bring down the Corps as a sort of payback for harms she believes she&#39;s suffered. Lastly, there is the perspective of Hibiki Sakurama, a true-blue Ranger who hopes to recapture the ideas and ways of the original Ranger teams of old that he believes have been lost in the Corps current iteration.

As the title makes clear, fans can expect Go! Go! Loser Ranger! to tease and poke fun at the Power Rangers franchise that started it all. But it&#39;s done in a way that is neither gratuitous nor makes them look too ridiculous.Go! Go! Loser Ranger! develops and a story that would be interesting without any Power Rangers connections but also comments on tropes that fans readily recognize and have been critical of for years.

The first two chapters of Go! Go! Loser Ranger! are available to read through Kodansha&#39;s K Manga App for free.
