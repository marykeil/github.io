## Literature Review

While Demon Slayer&#39;s Hashira are all incredibly powerful, not all of them are charismatic. These are all 9 Hashira ranked by likability!




The Hashira of Demon Slayer are some of the most prominent characters in the series, and though ranking them on power is simple, ranking them on likability can be a lot more tricky. Demon Slayer&#39;s Hashira run the gamut from absolute jerks to the sweetest people in the series.
Ultimately, how each Hashira interacts with Tanjiro, Nezuko, and the other slayers plays a big role in how likable they are. Though Demon Slayer&#39;s world is harsh, that doesn&#39;t mean everyone fighting darkness has to be a total jerk about it.









 








 9  Sanemi Shinazugawa, The Wind Hashira, is Full of Anger 
First Appearance: Episode 22, &#34;Master of the Mansion&#34;
        

The Wind Hashira, Sanemi, was heavily featured in the Hashira meeting, where most of the Hashira were introduced in the anime. During the meeting, Sanemi committed an act more unforgivable than some demons by stabbing Nezuko completely unprovoked. While almost all the Hashira agreed that Nezuko had to be dealt with as a demon, Sanemi&#39;s cruel and unusual treatment of Tanjiro&#39;s sister made fans quick to dislike him. His actions aside, Sanemi&#39;s angry and abrasive personality have made it difficult for him to resonate with viewers. Even with his tragic origin revealed, Demon Slayer&#39;s Wind Hashira comes off as a lot less sympathetic than his younger brother, Genya.





 8  Obanai Iguro, The Serpent Hashira, Cares for None 
First Appearance: Episode 22, &#34;Master of the Mansion&#34;
        

Anime fans have seen little of the Serpent Hashira, Obanai Iguro. His only two appearances have been at the initial Hashira meeting and a brief appearance after the battle with Daki and Gyutaro in the Entertainment District arc. The main actions taken by Obanai so far have been trying to kill Nezuko, knocking Tanjiro down and pinning him to the floor, and insulting the Demon Slayer&#39;s powerful Sound Hashira Tengen Usui despite his own tardiness to the battle. Obanai has exclusively behaved in a rude and condescending manner, even to his fellow Hashira, ensuring he wasn&#39;t a very likable character. In fact, the only person Obanai seems to respect at all is the Demon Slayer Corps&#39; leader, Kagaya Ubuyashiki.





 7  Gyomei Himejima, the Stone Hashira, is Quiet and Unknown 
First Appearance: Episode 21, &#34;Against Corps Rules&#34;
        

The blind Stone Hashira, Gyomei Himejima, didn&#39;t make a huge impression during his initial appearance, despite having one of Demon Slayer&#39;s strongest breathing forms. Gyomei is a gentle giant, shedding tears at the tragedy faced by Tanjiro, but that doesn&#39;t mean he was willing to show Nezuko much mercy. That attitude makes him more commendable than characters like Sanemi and Obanai, but there&#39;s still not enough from Gyomei yet to make him genuinely likable. Even as of the Swordsmith Village arc, Gyomei remains one of the least-known Hashira in the anime, so he&#39;ll simply have to wait for his time to shine before moving up the list.





 6  Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Hashira, is Ambivalent and Apathetic 
First Appearance: Episode 21, &#34;Against Corps Rules&#34;


 







Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Hashira, is the youngest Hashira at just 14 years old, making him slightly younger than Tanjiro. A child prodigy who achieved his status in less than two months of training, the Mist Hashira is one of the most impressive members of the group as a fighter, even without accounting for his age. Muichiro doesn&#39;t take a side in the debate about Nezuko in the Hashira meeting, ignoring it altogether. He reappears in the Swordsmith Village arc, where his tragic past is revealed. As it turns out, Muichiro was once a kind young boy and only became as apathetic as he is when he was struck with amnesia. Whether Muichiro returns to being kind isn&#39;t yet clear, but it&#39;s enough to put him in the middle of the Hashira pack when it comes to likability, at least.





 5  Mitsuri Kanroji, the Love Hashira, is A Supportive Big Sister 
First Appearance: Episode 21, &#34;Against Corps Rules&#34;


 







As the Love Hashira, Mitsuri is best known for her unusual sword in Demon Slayer, and her extreme affection for everyone in the Corps. While Mitsuri wasn&#39;t quite as belligerent as other Hashira in their treatment of Nezuko, she didn&#39;t do much to actually help Tanjiro&#39;s sister in this first encounter, either. However, when Mitsuri reappears in the Swordsmith Village arc, she regards Nezuko and Tanjiro warmly, Mitsuri even treats Nezuko as if she were her own little sister. She&#39;s also quick to come to the defense of the village when it comes under attack, prioritizing the safety of the non-combatants in the area.





 4  Tengen Uzui, the Sound Hashira, is a Good-Natured Lady&#39;s Man 
First Appearance: Episode 21, &#34;Against Corps Rules&#34;
        

Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui was the second Hashira to get a starring role in the series alongside Tanjiro&#39;s gang, following Rengoku&#39;s appearance in the Mugen Train film. The sound Hashira brought the main trio in to help save his wives and investigate one of the Twelve Kizuki, who turned out to be Daki and Gyutaro. Despite being maimed early in the fight against Gyutaro, Tengen fought one-handed to help keep the Upper Moon at bay while Tanjiro decapitated him. Despite his oddly flashy showing in the Hashira meeting, Tengen turned out to be a reliable ally for Nezuko and Tanjiro, making him one of the most friendly and likable Hashira.





 3  Shinobu Kocho, the Insect Hashira, is Hospitable 
First Appearance: Episode 15, &#34;Mount Natagumo&#34;
        

Shinobu Kocho, the Insect Hashira, has the bizarre distinction of being the only Hashira who lacks the strength needed to behead a demon. Instead, this Hashira has mastered the use of poison to take out her foes, resulting in her unique Insect Breathing style in Demon Slayer. Shinbou was the first Hashira to go after Nezuko and Tanjiro, but quickly changed her tune after their leader Kagaya supported the siblings. Shinobu&#39;s rescue of Zenitsu and her hospitality towards the main trio helped win over fans. Her relationship with her adopted sister Kanao also provided the character more depth and showed that she has an empathetic streak which many of the other Hashira lack.





 2  Kyojuro Rengoku, the Flame Hashira, is a Warm and Friendly Mentor 
First Appearance: Episode 21, &#34;Against Corps Rules&#34;


 







Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku was the star of one of the best anime movies of 2020, Demon Slayer: Mugen Train. The energetic Flame Hashira was best known for his love of good food and his burning desire to save everyone around him, even at the cost of his own life. In fact, one of the few things detracting from Kyojuro&#39;s heroic behavior was his initial decision to kill Nezuko at the Hashira meeting. Unlike many other Hashira, however, Kyojuro apologized to Tanjiro over this once Nezuko was accepted by Kagaya. Kyojuro&#39;s warm personality mixed with his protective nature make it hard not to love the Flame Hashira, and despite his eventual fate, he remains one of the most well-liked of the nine current Hashira.
            
 
 Demon Slayer: Tanjiro&#39;s First Breathing Style Has A Hidden Meaning 
As a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro learns to use Water Breathing techniques to fight first - but does this have a deeper meaning beyond hacking and slashing?








 1  Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira, is Quietly Passionate 
First Appearance: Episode 1, &#34;Cruelty&#34;
        

The Water Hashira was the very first demon slayer that Tanjiro met, just after his family was killed. After initially being aggressive toward Nezuko, Giyu realized almost immediately that there was something different about the Kamado siblings, and he sent them to be trained by his master, the former Water Hashira Urokodaki. Giyu wasn&#39;t just the catalyst for Tanjiro becoming a demon slayer, however; he was also the only Hashira who accepted Nezuko without Kagaya&#39;s influence, even stepping in to protect her from the others. Tomioka&#39;s personality, while characteristically stoic, is also protective and surprisingly passionate. Despite Shinobu&#39;s claim that Giyu isn&#39;t well-liked by the other Hashira, he may well be the most popular Hashira with the fans.
