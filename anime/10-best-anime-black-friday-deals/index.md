Anime prices were $60 - $65, and manga box sets were $44 - $66.


 







The final episode of the gripping Attack on Titan anime was released in November. Now that the series has concluded, many fans are tempted to collect and enjoy the series from the beginning. Thankfully, Amazon has both the manga and the Blu-rays of the incredibly animated and twist-filled story that captivated millions worldwide. While Attack on Titan is not a tale for the faint of heart with its gruesome action and gut-punching character deaths, it&#39;s a story that will quickly hook viewers&#39; attention with cliffhangers that are so powerful that mature viewers will likely have a hard time not bingeing the series.

The Neon Genesis Evangelion anime collection was $60.


 







There have been few anime series that have made such an impact on the medium than Neon Genesis Evangelion. What begins as a mysterious story about young teenagers piloting larger-than-life robots quickly defies all expectations to become a cerebral drama filled with epic action and plot twists that stick in viewers&#39; minds years after the first viewing. NGE managed to become one of the best mech anime in existence while also becoming a dramatic commentary on the genre that was so prevalent in Japan during the 1980s.

 3  Pokémon DVDs &amp; Blu-Rays ($15 - $37) 
The Pokémon anime prices were $20 - $70.


 







Pokémon is a franchise that needs no introduction. Among the many video games and films, the Pokémon anime stands as a series that introduced an entire generation to anime like few series have. Now that a lot of the series&#39; original fans have grown up and had children of their own, reliving the classic anime is a delightful experience to share for a family looking for a show to watch together filled with well-written comedy and exciting battles that do not get nearly as violent as other popular anime.

 2  Castlevania Anime Season 1 &amp; 2 Blu-Ray Bundle ($15) 
The anime bundle was $30.

The first two seasons of the series tell a very moving tale of revenge, sorrow, and love that can be thoroughly enjoyed by any mature audience member, even if they have never played a Castlevania game. While the series has continued to grow, the second season&#39;s ending remains one of the story&#39;s most epic and satisfying conclusions, making this set a steal at $15.
