## Literature Review

War is an unfortunate part of our reality, and these anime series strive to capture all the complexities that war can bring to a narrative.




The medium of anime might not be what comes to mind when first thinking of war stories, but there are actually a great many classic anime series that focus on telling the tale of a war where all hangs in the balance. While some anime use war as just a small piece of the puzzle, other series make war their main focus, telling the tale of how one great country fell to another.
The best war anime have a grand scale, capturing the enormity of what war is and what it means for two countries to go to war. The protagonist might be a great hero of this war, or they could be an ordinary soldier out in the trenches, experiencing a far less glamorous side of things. War anime might be set in the medieval past, the modern day, or in the distant future, but regardless of setting, the realities of war often remain the same. It&#39;s kill or be killed on the battlefield, and that&#39;s true whether one has a sword, a machine gun, or a starship.

 7  Full Metal Panic! - What it Means to Be a Child Soldier 
Created by Shoji Gatoh, animated by Gonzo Digimation
        

Full Metal Panic! is a mecha anime series set in a rough equivalent to the modern day, and follows Sosuke Sagara, a former child soldier from Afghanistan who now works for the anti-terrorist military organization known as Mithril. Sagara is entrusted with the safety of Kaname Chidori, a Japanese school girl who many groups are after for unknown reasons, at least to Sagara. The series has its share of conventional combat in addition to mecha fights, but one thing it does especially well is showcase the trauma that Sagara has from his time as a child soldier, and how Kaname helps him to build trust for the first time.
Full Metal Panic! has a goofy side series, Fumoffu, in addition to two proper sequels: The Second Raid and Invisible Victory, which continue the story.

 6  Vinland Saga - Turning Away From War 
Created by Makoto Yukimura, animated by Wit Studio and MAPPA


 







Vinland Saga tells the story of Thorfinn, initially a young boy on a quest to avenge his father&#39;s death. Thorfinn is swept up into the conflict between England and Denmark, and despite his father&#39;s warnings against violence, ends up in the middle, dealing death himself at every turn. Vinland Saga really captures how a desire for revenge is the thing which keeps large-scale conflicts alive, as new combatants join to avenge those who have already fallen on both sides. The second season, which still involves Thorfinn, is a fairly major departure from the first, but it continues many of the themes about war just as easily.

 5  Alderamin on the Sky - From Nobody to War Hero 
Created by Bokuto Uno, animated by Madhouse

However, when a war breaks out between his home nation of the Katjvarna Empire and the Republic of Kioka, Ikta ends up joining the military alongside his childhood friend Yatorishino. The story is all about how a boy who doesn&#39;t want to be a hero ends up becoming one anyway, and how he deals with this fact is a key element of the series. It explores what it&#39;s like to have greatness thrust upon you, and how difficult it can be to live up to others&#39; images of you.

Created by Yoshiki Tanaka, animated by Liden Films and Sanzigen

Arslan follows the eponymous character, prince of a land known as Pars (based on Persia), who sees his country taken over by the neighboring nation of Lusitania after a diabolical plot takes down the King. Arslan, who barely escapes, must now put together an army and retake his homeland, and become the rightful king he was always meant to be.

 2  The Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - An Epic War in Space 
Created by Yoshiki Tanaka, animated by Production I.G.
        

The Legend of Galactic Heroes is based on a long-running light novel series by Yoshiki Tanaka, and follows two heroes on opposite sides of a war: Yang Wen Li, a genius who wants nothing to do with war in the Free Planets Alliance, and Reinhard von Lohengramm, an equally genius noble on the side of the Galactic Empire. Yang and Reinhard make for fascinating contrasting protagonists, and their different viewpoints on war are an inherent part of their characters. It&#39;s a grand tale of strategy, underdog heroics, political intrigue and of course, war, with no other series out there quite like it.
Die Neue These is a remake of a late 80s/early 90s Legend of Galactic Heroes anime which is also an excellent war story.

 1  Kingdom - A Quest to Unify the Warring States 
Created by Yasuhisa Hara, animated by Studio Pierrot
        

Kingdom is a series set in China during the Warring States period of Chinese history, and follows a war orphan, Xin, as he sets out on his quest to become the kind of war hero who can finally unite China for the first time in hundreds of years. Xin falls in with the King of the land of Qin, and becomes a top general for him, aiding the King to achieve their dream of bringing China together. The story involves a healthy dose of politics in addition to war drama, and explores both the high-level and low-level perspectives on war. While it&#39;s definitely one of the longest series on this list, it&#39;s also easily at the top.
