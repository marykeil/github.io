## SUMMARY 



  Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2 fixes the problem of Armin&#39;s final conversation with Eren that made the manga&#39;s ending even more controversial.

## Literature Review

Attack on Titan&#39;s final chapter became incredibly divisive for a variety of reasons, and the anime adaptation has fixed one of its biggest issues.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2.Attack on Titan’s anime has finally come to a close, and it fixes one of the biggest problems with the manga’s ending. Among the many controversial points of chapter #139, one major problem was that Armin appeared to be okay with Eren’s actions to the point of thanking him for becoming a mass murderer, and that felt like the story was trying too hard to paint Eren as a hero.




Armin’s apparent approval of Eren’s actions was a major problem in Attack on Titan’s ending, but Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2 managed to fix it. Attack on Titan creator Hajime Isayama said that he had worked with the staff to make the finale a little different from the manga, and that came out mostly with how Armin’s treatment of Eren was handled.

          

Isayama has previously commented on Armin’s dialogue and expressed regret that he failed to properly convey Armin’s true feelings, so it makes sense that that would be changed for the anime, and it results in a finale far better than the original manga’s.

                  Attack On Titan&#39;s New Chapter Could Fix The Series&#39; Controversial Ending   In 2024, Attack on Titan will be receiving a new story for the first time in three years, and it&#39;s a perfect chance to fix its controversial ending.   





 Attack On Titan’s Finale Makes It Clear That Armin Doesn’t Approve Of The Rumbling 
          

The biggest way that Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2 fixes Armin’s dialogue with Eren is simple: he doesn’t approve of the Rumbling. Not only was Armin disgusted by the Rumbling destroying 80% of humanity, but Armin called Eren out for how his plan wouldn’t save anyone on Paradis Island, but just give people more reasons to fight. That train of thought was maintained at the very end of the episode when everyone remarked that Eren’s plan to make them heroes only served to paint a target on their backs, so it’s much clearer that no one approves of Eren than it was in the manga.



 Attack On Titan’s Anime Finale Makes Its Themes Easier To Understand 
          




The biggest boon to how Attack on Titan’s anime fixes Armin’s dialogue with Eren is that it’s much easier to understand the themes of the finale. By not having Armin or anyone else do anything that comes off as approving of Eren, Attack on Titan’s central concept that violence isn’t the answer to solving major problems in the world can be conveyed far easier because the characters don’t say anything to directly contradict the idea. That doesn’t fix all the problems Attack on Titan had with getting that message across, but it’s a notable change that adds a lot to the finale, nonetheless.

That idea is taken even further with how the changes to Armin’s dialogue caused changes to Eren’s dialogue. After Eren justifies his actions as being inevitable due to his visions of the future, Armin calls him out on how terrible his plan was. Eren, unlike in the manga, admits that he only settled on the Rumbling because he couldn’t come up with anything better. If Eren himself admitted that his actions weren’t the best solution, then that’s a strong denial that Eren&#39; action should ever be seen as rightful. It all serves to tremendously fix the problem created by Armin’s dialogue in Attack on Titan’s manga finale, and that makes the anime’s version far above the ending of the original.
