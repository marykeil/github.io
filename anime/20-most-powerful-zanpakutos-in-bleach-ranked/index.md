# 20 Most Powerful Zanpakutos in Bleach, Ranked


## SUMMARY 


 The strength of a Zanpakuto in Bleach is influenced by the deep bond between the weapon and its wielder, as well as the shinigami&#39;s Reiryoku. 
 Older and more experienced fighters generally have more Reiryoku, resulting in more powerful Zanpakuto. 
 Certain Zanpakuto, like Komamura&#39;s Tenken and Kuchiki&#39;s Sode No Shirayuki, have unique abilities that can cause significant damage.

## Literature Review

Bleach&#39;s iconic weapon, the Zanpakuto, appears in a range of shapes and forms. Its power, however, depends entirely on the wielder. 




One of the many concepts that Bleach is known and loved for is the Zanpakuto, the iconic weapon used by the Shinigami (or Soul Reapers) of the Soul Society. The nature of a Zanpakuto depends on its wielder&#39;s personality; as such, both entities tend to form a close spiritual bond over time. That said, the depth of their relationship is only one factor that affects the Zanpakuto&#39;s strength—the other one being Reiryoku, or spirit aura.
The quantity of Reiryoku possessed by a shinigami is directly proportional to the Zanpakuto&#39;s overall power, which means that older and more experienced fighters tend to have better weapons. This isn&#39;t a universal rule, especially since shinigami don&#39;t really age like ordinary humans, but there is some merit to the assumption. This list uses entries from both the manga and anime, so those who haven&#39;t read the manga should be aware of spoilers.









 








 20  Tenken 
Sajin Komamura
        

Komamura&#39;s Zanpakuto initially takes the form of an ordinary-looking katana, but its unsealed states are far from ordinary. In its Shikai form, Komamura&#39;s Zanpakuto can create phantasmal arms and legs which emulate Komamura&#39;s movements, including a phantom hand holding a huge blade. This gets taken up to eleven in the Bankai state, Kokujō Tengen Myō-ō, as Komamura manifests an armored giant wielding an absolutely massive sword, allowing him to score powerful hits while keeping his distance. The sheer size of Komamura&#39;s Bankai can cause a lot of collateral damage, however, and must be used carefully.





 19  Sayafushi 
Oetsu Nimaiya
        

Oetsu Nimaiya is a member of Bleach&#39;s Squad Zero, and the original creator of all Zanpakuto. His blade, known as Sayafushi, is so sharp and smooth that it&#39;s impossible to keep in a sheath, causing Nimaiya to consider it a failure. Instead, he stores it in a tank of mysterious, thick liquid, where it can&#39;t accidentally cut anything. Sayafushi&#39;s Shikai and Bankai abilities are unknown, but Nimaiya still managed to do an incredible amount of damage with the blade in its sealed state, shocking the attacking Elite Guard of Yhwach. Like other members of Squad Zero, Nimaiya&#39;s Bankai is said to be so powerful that if two of them tried to use Bankai at once, the world might be destroyed.





 18  Suzumushi 
Kaname Tosen
        

Kaname Tosen is one of the Shinigami who defected alongside Aizen, and was a loyal follower of the former captain. The blade takes the form of a katana with a droplet-shaped guard. When he activates its first Shikai ability, it emits a high-pitched squeal that can knock opponents unconscious in an instant. He can also call down a storm of blades to fall upon his opponents, destroying them while they&#39;re helpless. His Bankai takes this to the next level, trapping opponents in a dark void where they&#39;re deprived of all senses except for touch, allowing the blind swordsman to obliterate his foes with ease.





 17  Sode No Shirayuki 
Rukia Kuchiki
        

Rukia Kuchiki might have lost her powers at the start of the series, but she soon proves her abilities by showing how proficient she is in wielding Kido and Reiatsu. Her Zanpakuto, Sode No Shirayuki, is also a weapon that shouldn&#39;t be disregarded by the show&#39;s fans. In its Shikai form, Sode No Shirayuki can freeze a target from a distance and create an ice blade that can lengthen its blade. Rukia can also use Sode No Shirayuki in its Bankai release to freeze her body and prevent any substance from damaging her, dropping to absolute zero.





 16  Sogyo No Kotowari 
Jushiro Ukitake
        

Captain Jushiro Ukitake is the host of the Soul King&#39;s right hand, Mimihagi. Jushiro&#39;s personality is approachable and honorable, which allows other members of Soul Society to feel comfortable around him. That being said, Jushiro is also feared around Soul Society due to his skills and Zanpakuto. Sogyo No Kotowari, Jushiro&#39;s Zanpakuto, turns into dual blades connected by a rope-like chain in its Shikai form. What&#39;s notable about Sogyo No Kotowari is that it can absorb an opponent&#39;s attack using the left blade and release it as an amplified attack using the right blade, allowing Jushiro to destroy an enemy with force.





 15  Shinso 
Gin Ichimaru
        

Gin Ichimaru is one of the most popular characters in Bleach due to his mysterious behavior and motives. But after betraying Soul Society and aiding Aizen Sosuke, it is soon revealed that Gin actually has good intentions and wanted to save Soul Society. In order to gain the trust of Aizen, Gin had to prove his skills and abilities. Apart from his superior intellect, Gin&#39;s Zanpakuto is extremely powerful. The Shikai form of Shinso transforms it into an elongated and flexible blade that moves extremely fast, allowing Gin to reach and easily strike his enemies from a distance.





 14  Wabisuke 
Izuru Kira
        

The lieutenant of Captain Rojuro Otoribashi is most known for his indifferent and cocky personality. Because of that, many fans of the series often perceive Izuru Kira as a weak leader. However, Izuru can easily provide himself on the battlefield thanks to his mastery of wielding the Zanpakuto Wabisuke. When the Shikai form of Wabisuke is activated, the edge of the blade makes two 90-degree angles, resembling a hook. Anything that Wabisuke strikes becomes more cumbersome as the object&#39;s weight magically doubles. This allows Izuru to easily slow down enemies since they won&#39;t be able to lift their weapons.





 13  Senbonzakura 
Byakuya Kuchiki
        

Byakuya Kuchiki is Rukia&#39;s older brother and a feared captain in Soul Society. While he may be perceived as arrogant by some, Byakuya is a skillful Shinigami who just wants to strictly uphold the laws of Soul Society using his Zanpakuto named Senbonzakura. When it&#39;s not activated, Senbonzakura takes the form of a regular katana. However, Senbonzakura shatters into thousands of blade fragments in its Shikai form, allowing Byakuya to shred an enemy whenever he pleases. The blade fragments are also used by Byakuya to protect himself from enemy attacks.





 12  Hyorinmaru 
Toshiro Hitsugaya
        

Toshiro Hitsugaya proves himself as one of the smartest characters in Bleach by being the youngest Shinigami to become a captain in Soul Society history, a status he earns with the help of his exceptional swordsmanship. His Zanpakuto, Hyorinmaru, generates fields of ice when released in Shikai — significantly magnifying when he goes Bankai. Interestingly, Daiguren Hyorinmaru&#39;s &#34;completed version&#34; is vastly more powerful than most Zanpakuto; however, it cannot be used for prolonged periods of time due to the natural limitations placed on Hitsugaya&#39;s adult transformation.





 11  Ashisogi Jizo 
Mayuri Kurotsuchi
        

Unlike many other captains, Mayuri Kurotsuchi has neither vast reserves of Reiryoku nor any notable battle capabilities. That said, his sublime genius allows him to augment his Zanpakuto abilities by experimenting on Ashisogi Jizo. Mayuri has installed a &#34;self-destruct&#34; mechanism within his Bankai, prompting it to revert into sword form if it somehow turns on him. In his fight with Pernida, Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo reveals its latest modification, Matai Fukuin Shotai, whose thousands of nerve strata prevent it from being externally manipulated. This Zanpakuto is especially dangerous against opponents who rely on brute strength.





 10  Katen Kyokotsu 
Shunsui Kyoraku
        

Shunsui Kyoraku is an incredibly powerful Shinigami, a fact reflected in the complexity of his Zanpakuto techniques. Katen Kyokotsu translates &#34;children&#39;s games into reality&#34;, giving its wielder an edge because only he knows how the rules work. That said, Kyoraku openly discloses his Zanpakuto mechanics to Coyote Starrk and still defeats the Primera Espada, proving that his promotion to Head Captain is well-deserved. Katen Kyokotsu&#39;s Bankai, Karamatsu Shinju, has an enormous area of effect, forcing an atmosphere of doom and gloom on any living entity trapped within its space.





 9  Benihime 
Kisuke Urahara
        

Urahara&#39;s Benihime is known for its versatile special abilities—from spawning reishi bombs to engulfing opponents in a nigh-indestructible mesh. He rarely uses his Shikai in direct swordfighting, instead preferring to unleash Reiatsu blasts from a safe distance. On the other hand, Kannonbiraki Benihime Aratame permits Urahara to partake in close combat by reorganizing the structure of both his environment and himself in order to turn the tides of battle in his favor. Although he states that his Zanpakuto isn&#39;t an effective training tool, Benihime can be devastating in a serious fight.





 8  Minazuki 
Retsu Unohana
        

Unohana plays the role of medic with her manta-ray Minazuki, healing enemies and allies with equal compassion. After the Wandenreich attack on Seireitei in the Thousand-Year Blood War arc, though, Kyoraku insists that she train Zaraki Kenpachi how to manifest his unreleased Zanpakuto. Unohana is a force of nature, beating her successor down hundreds of times, despite the latter increasing in power with every loss. She ultimately brings out her Bankai, also named Minazuki, prolonging the battle until Kenpachi reaches his full potential and kills her. It&#39;s unfortunate that the most powerful female character in Bleach is relegated to such a humiliating fate.





 7  Sakanade 
Shinji Hirako
        

Shinji was the leader of the Visored, and is now the captain of squad 5. His Zanpakuto Sakanade has an hourglass-like guard, but otherwise looks like a normal katana. Sakanade&#39;s Shikai form allows it to reverse the directions for opponents, making up into down and left into right, causing mass confusion. However, it&#39;s his Bankai, which was only revealed in the anime adaptation of Thousand-Year Blood War, that really packs a punch. When in Bankai release, Sakashima Yokoshima Happofusagari, it forces enemies within a massive area to fight each other to the death. While undeniably powerful, Shinji must be careful when he uses it that allies aren&#39;t accidentally included in its range.





 6  Nozarashi 
Zaraki Kenpachi
        

Kenpachi uses his Reiatsu to fuel most of his early fights, but his jagged blade is clearly too weak to take on the Sternritter. Once he awakens his Zanpakuto, Nozarashi, his overall attack power receives a substantial upgrade. Kenpachi takes down Gremmy Thoumeaux with his Shikai, and nearly kills the seemingly invincible Gerard Valkyrie after Yachiru triggers his Bankai for the first time. Kenpachi might be an overpowered character even without a Zanpakuto, but Nozarashi takes him to incomprehensible heights.





 5  Kyoka Suigetsu 
Sosuke Aizen
        

Aizen Sosuke is a major threat to Soul Society, as much for his overwhelming Reiatsu as Kyoka Suigetsu&#39;s &#34;Perfect Hypnosis&#34; ability. Given that he&#39;s the only major character without a Bankai reveal, Aizen&#39;s Shikai is more than enough to defeat scores of experienced combatants without needing to go on the defensive. Kyoka Suigetsu&#39;s illusions extend to all five senses, making it practically impossible to defeat its wielder. Aizen&#39;s Zanpakuto even succeeds in altering Yhwach&#39;s perception on two separate occasions.





 4  Zangetsu 
Ichigo Kurosaki
        

Ichigo goes through several iterations of Zanpakuto before achieving its true form: a pair of swords that each represent his Hollow and Quincy aspects. After spending time training in the Royal Realm, his trademark Getsuga Tensho becomes vastly more effective (and less wasteful). However, it is his Bankai, Tensa Zangetsu, that proves how brave Ichigo is and shows his significant growth over the course of two years. He even manages to &#34;kill&#34; Yhwach with it, failing only because the villain&#39;s omnipotent Almighty Schrift reconfigures the timeline to prevent his death.





 3  Shigarami 
Senjumaru Shutara
        

Another member of Squad Zero, Senjumaru got to use her Zanpakuto to its full potential only in the Thousand-Year Blood War anime. Shigarami&#39;s Shikai state takes the form of an oversized sewing needle, appropriate to the designer of the Shinigami&#39;s iconic shihakusho robes. Its Bankai, like Nimaiya&#39;s, was sealed to prevent accidentally destroying the universe, but the threat posed by Yhwach was so great that it was unsealed. When using her Bankai, known as Shatatsu Karagara Shigarami no Tsuji, Senjumaru is able to manipulate the fabric of space and time just as easily as actual fabric, allowing her to create bespoke prisons of torment for her adversaries.





 2  Ichimonji 
Ichibei Hyosube
        

As the leader of the Zero Squad, Ichibei Hyosube is excluded from the list of characters in Bleach who have weak Bankais. He boasts of such incredible Reiryoku that Yhwach himself is wary of fighting him. His Ichimonji is capable of erasing an opponent&#39;s power by covering them with calligraphic ink, not to mention wielding control over the abstract concept of &#34;blackness.&#34; Shirafude Ichimonji reverses the theme of his Shikai by enforcing a name on the target, thereby imbuing the latter with the attributes associated with the name. There is nothing that can stand against the might of Ichibei and Ichimonji.





 1  Ryujin Jakka 
Shigekuni Yamamoto Genryusai
        

Captain-Commander Yamamoto has the most powerful Zanpakuto. His Zanpakuto is a weapon of mass destruction, a fire that cannot be blocked, dodged, or contained. Known as Ryujin Jakka, it is said to have &#34;greater offensive power than all other Zanpakuto in Soul Society,&#34; a claim that proves itself on multiple occasions. Yamamoto&#39;s Shikai vaporizes everyone and everything in its path, and his Bankai, Zanka no Tachi, burns at the same temperature as the sun&#39;s core: 27 million °F. Powerful enemies like Aizen and Yhwach are terrified of the old man&#39;s Zanpakuto, explaining why they neutralize it before dealing with him.
Every Zanpakuto is different, which can make comparing their abilities and potential difficult at times. Still, these Zanpakuto manage to stand out due not only to their performance in the story, but also from the sheer raw power that&#39;s on display. A Zanpakuto is inextricably tied to its wielder, and together their power can achieve new heights. A shinigami&#39;s own power becomes a part of the Zanpakuto, enabling the insane powers that are on display all throughout Bleach.
