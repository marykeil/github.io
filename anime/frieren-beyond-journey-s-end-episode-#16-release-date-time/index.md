## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #16 will likely introduce a new character who has deep ties to one of the members of the main cast.




Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #16 will likely continue the series’ wonderful exploration of its world and characters through short, fun adventures. These stories can range from exciting action pieces to emotional vignettes, but the anime portrays both wonderfully. If episode #16 maintains this quality, then it will be another beautiful addition to the series.

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #15? 
          

Episode #15 was divided into two stories. The first featured Frieren and her friends encountering a village that was put under a sleeping curse. Sein and Frieren tracked down the source of this curse and when put in a tight spot the priest had to decide whether to trust Frieren to defeat the monster. He did, and the party grew closer as a result. The second story involved a noble hiring Stark to pretend to be his dead son. This was an emotional tale as the noble used Stark to hold on to his son&#39;s memory and Stark likewise was reminded of his own dead family. The episode ultimately ended with the noble offering to adopt Stark full-time, but Stark refused as he had to eventually return to Eisen and make things right with his main father figure.






Stark and Fern also had a beautifully animated dance together.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #16 May Introduce A New Ally 
          

It is generally difficult to predict what new episodes of Frieren will have in store given how episodic the series is, but the title of episode #16 can provide a good clue as to that episode&#39;s plot. Episode #16 is titled “Long-Lived Friend”, which implies that it will introduce a new character from one of the main cast&#39;s pasts. Given the friend is “Long-Lived”, this will likely be a former ally of Frieren&#39;s as the elf is immortal. It could however also be Sein&#39;s childhood friend who set off to become an adventurer. This is deeply tied to Sein&#39;s motivation for joining Frieren&#39;s party so if this is the case then the episode will likely explore his character more.




Regardless of what the episode is about, the animation and production quality of Frieren will likely remain at its superb level. Even when not displaying action scenes, Studio Madhouse&#39;s animation is beautiful to behold. This animation, combined with fun characters and a unique story, is what will keep fans coming back to Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End for episode #16 and beyond.

Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #16 when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 22, 2023.
