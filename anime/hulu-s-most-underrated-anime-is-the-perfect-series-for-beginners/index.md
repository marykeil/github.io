 Summertime Rendering Is One Of The Best Time Travel Anime 
Based on the manga by Yasuki Tanaka and produced by Studio OLM
          

 Year Released  2020   Number of Episodes  24   Where To Stream  Disney&#43;, Hulu   






The story is about Shinpei who goes back to his native island to attend his childhood friend Ushio&#39;s funeral. Upon inquiring the circumstances of her death, he finds strangle marks on her and that she was murdered. He does some digging together with Ushio&#39;s sister Mio and as they get close to the truth, they are brutally murdered. Shinpei finds himself in the island&#39;s port on the day he arrives for the funeral. Although he can go back every time he&#39;s killed and take measures to prevent his death, the time travel ability does have its drawbacks and isn&#39;t as reliable as he thought. There is a bigger conspiracy than he could&#39;ve imagined and Ushio&#39;s death is just the beginning.

Summertime Rendering has explosive action sequences that will dazzle anyone. From the creators of PokÃ©mon and Berserk, the anime has surprisingly gorgeous visuals and even more surprising animation. The studio spared no resources to make the show as dazzling as possible, even bringing on the pioneer animator Arifumi Imai, who&#39;s made many of Attack On Titan&#39;s most iconic fights, to animate the fight between Ushio and a shadow. It&#39;s very easy to tell that every fight had a lot of planning and care put into it, with each one being better than the last.





 

Although the series is officially categorized as a thriller/mystery anime, this doesn&#39;t do the show justice as it is more than just an anime that will have fans on the edge of their seat. There is a lot of heartwarming romance, amazing action, and a plot so intricate it puts a lot of story-driven anime to shame. The best part is that the series is wrapped up in 24 episodes, making it a great series to binge. It is an example of time travel anime done right, and it is arguably better than Stein&#39;s Gate and Erased in this aspect.
