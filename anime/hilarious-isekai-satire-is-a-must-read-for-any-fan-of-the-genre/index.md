## Literature Review

Everyone Is From Another World, Except Me!? sounds like a fresh take on isekai but it also adds a humorous, satirical swipe at the genre.






Everyone Is From Another World, Except Me!? by Natsuna Yuuma is also known as Boku Igai Zennin Tenseisha Ka Yo!?







Isekai fans who won&#39;t get offended by a series that purposely pokes fun at the genre will undoubtedly enjoy Everyone Is From Another World, Except Me!? just because of how well it satirizes the anime and manga phenomenon. It will likely appeal to well-read veterans because of the many tropes it deconstructs, and newcomers will even benefit just because it essentially serves as a guide to just about every great isekai out there.

As the title unsurprisingly reveals, the series by Natsuna Yuuma features a high number of isekai&#39;d characters, and each one of them represents a different type of stereotypical isekai protagonist. Of course, all of them died by the same means and use similar phrasing to explain their predicament, which adds to the overall comical delivery.

          




Their hilarious commentary on certain scenarios also underscores just how most formulated Isekai are, since their shared knowledge of them proves how ubiquitous and overused they are.


 Twists Abound In This Satirical Isekai

Despite being an obvious satire, the series ironically features a twist that very few Isekai have explored, if any. It&#39;s common knowledge that every isekai series stars a protagonist who finds themselves transported into another world. While rare, some manga or anime deviate from the usual blueprint to some degree, like in the now well-established reverse isekai subgenre. In this series, Rocco doesn&#39;t leave his world at all. It&#39;s only the members of his party who are so-called &#34;reincarnators&#34;. This allows Rocco to provide an outsider&#39;s perspective on isekai clichés that are oftentimes humorous, like his comments on the coincidence that all of them just happened to die the same way.




Ironically or not, Rocco&#39;s uniqueness isn&#39;t spared. Even though he&#39;s an Isekai protagonist who uncharacteristically doesn&#39;t get Isekai&#39;d, the series quickly sullies his once-subversive character by having him undergo a well-known trope that many typical heroes go through. Regardless, as the protagonist, his unique insider perspective allows the series to revolve around a situation that Isekai naturally can&#39;t do. In almost every series, isekai&#39;d heroes obviously don&#39;t have any connection to the new world they&#39;re rebotn into. They usually get involved by being dragged into a major war, especially in isekai series where heroes are manually summoned for a specific purpose. However, Rocco&#39;s plight is much more personal since he&#39;s lived in this fantasy world his whole life, and since he quickly befriends the &#34;reincarnators&#34;, they are automatically dragged into his drama when they would have most likely taken on a much grander quest.

          




With such a unique twist, like Rocco&#39;s unprecedented background as a protagonist, it should come as no surprise that the series goes out of its way to diminish the seriousness of this and other similar instances. This keeps Everyone Is From Another World, Except Me!?&#39;s tone hilariously ridiculous, while allowing the series to continually serve as a much-needed satirical Isekai.
