## Literature Review

The Flash might be able to heal physical wounds in an instant, but heâ€™s got a way of processing intense emotional trauma in the blink of an eye.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #4!The Flash reveals his healing factor can cure even the deepest of wounds. The chaos of &#34;Beast World&#34; is hitting a boiling point as destruction rages across the DC Universe and bodies begin to pile up. When things become too much for one hero, Wally West reveals a secret to processing even the worst traumas.




In Titans: Beast World #4 by Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer, the Earth is still under attack by the radically changed Beast Boy, whose spores are infecting and turning people into ravenous animal-hybrids. Things only get worse when Wonder Woman&#39;s nemesis Giganta is turned into a giant bear and runs amok in Ivy Town.

          

Superman Jon Kent hears and sees the victims he and the rest of the heroes haven&#39;t been able to save. With the pressure too much for the junior Superman to handle, Flash helps Jon find his center by telling him to slow down his perception of time so he can process the trauma in a matter of microseconds.

Beast Boy became public enemy number one after he pushed his powers to their limits and became a Star Conqueror to repel an alien menace known as a Necrostar. But Amanda Waller, eager to do serious damage to the Titans&#39; reputations, had his mind erased, leaving Gar Logan stuck in his new form. Since then, &#39;Garro&#39; has been unleashing wave after wave of spores that have been turning the world&#39;s heroes and villains into animal-human hybrids. Worse, they&#39;re seeking out the most powerful hosts, intentionally choosing people as powerful as Black Adam to do untold levels of damage across the planet.

Healing factors are a phenomenal power, especially one as quick as the Flash&#39;s. Whatever damage is inflicted on the Fastest Man Alive, he can quickly recover and not really worry about any injuries he sustains. Most healing factors like Superman&#39;s or Wolverine&#39;s only focuses on physical wounds, but mental trauma never really factors into such a power. However, Wally has apparently found out how to give himself time to process intense distress in the middle of a battle. Rather than hide or bury his feelings, Flash has found a healthier way to deal with shock simply by altering his perception of time.






 Flash&#39;s Healing Factor Covers Emotional Wounds as Well 
          

Battles as intense as the one in &#34;Beast World&#34; are tough to deal with. It can be psychologically harmful to see all that carnage and not take time to process it. While most heroes don&#39;t have such a privilege, those who can make microseconds feel like minutes allow themselves a chance to make sure their mental health is taken care of. Most heroes don&#39;t have the time or freedom to process their emotions during a fight. But thanks to this secret fringe benefit, people like the Flash can healthily process even the most dire of circumstances.

Titans: Beast World #4 is on sale now from DC Comics.
