# My Hero Academia Reveals The Fate Of The First One For All User


## SUMMARY 



  All for One killed his own brother, Yoichi, without realizing it, showcasing his deep hatred for the second user of One for All.   All for One&#39;s relationship with Yoichi was characterized by possessiveness rather than love, with Yoichi viewed as a valued possession.   All for One&#39;s desire to reclaim One for All stems from it being a symbol of something he couldn&#39;t have, rather than being about its power or love for his brother.

## Literature Review

My Hero Academia finally tells fans what happened to the first One for All user and it&#39;s a perfect example of what a dastardly villain All for One is.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 407My Hero Academia has finally revealed what ended the life of the first user of One for All, and it turns out that the one who killed Yoichi was none other than his own brother, All for One. Lashing out in anger, All for One killed his own brother without even realizing it, establishing his deep hatred for the second user, who tried to rescue him.




Chapter #407 of My Hero Academia finally dips down into the backstory of All for One, giving fans a look at the big villain&#39;s life before he was such a devastatingly deadly threat to the world. The lives of All for One and his twin brother (and first user of One for All), Yoichi, were certainly marred by hardship, born without parents or anyone else to care for them. All for One kept Yoichi alive during these difficult times, but seemingly not out of anything that anyone would call love.

          

Rather, All for One had a possessiveness towards Yoichi, as if his brother was merely another thing that he owned. That reached a head when Yoichi attempted to escape from All for One after his encounter with the soon-to-be second user.

In the final pages of Chapter #407, Yoichi is shown trying to escape from All for One alongside the second user, who fans will know from previous chapters discovered Yoichi trapped in a room within All for One&#39;s compound. From All for One&#39;s perspective, the panels show Yoichi and the second user escaping, and suddenly a severed hand, no longer holding onto the Second&#39;s. All for One was already shown asking the second user what happened to his brother, suggesting that he has no actual memory of doing this; it was merely a selfish and impulsive decision that it seems All for One has regretted his entire life--though not for the right reasons.

The chapter makes it quite clear that All for One didn&#39;t look after his brother out of love, and that he saw him instead as a valued possession. All for One&#39;s goal was to make the whole world service him, and Yoichi just happened to be the first one to enter the young villain&#39;s new order. His decision to kill Yoichi seems like a childish one, that same &#34;if I can&#39;t have it, no one can&#34; energy which leads to the destruction of a toy over sharing it. It almost feels like yet another Star Wars reference in My Hero Academia, as the scene is quite similar to Anakin Skywalker&#39;s killing of Padme in Episode III. In both cases, the event in question was the final nail in the coffin, officially turning the character into an unrepentant villain.




All for One&#39;s desire to reclaim One for All hasn&#39;t been about its power, nor has it been about love for his brother. Instead, One for All became a symbol to All for One of the things that he couldn&#39;t have, and retaking it would finally give him back the one thing he&#39;s been denied these past decades. It&#39;s also why he absolutely can&#39;t be allowed to have it--the psychological victory of retaking One for All would be even more impactful than the loss of its power for the heroes. My Hero Academia has found a way to finally make its core villain a little deeper and more complex, by proving All for One is still at heart, that greedy child.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
