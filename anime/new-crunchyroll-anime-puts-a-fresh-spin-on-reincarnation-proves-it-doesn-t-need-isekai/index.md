## Literature Review

The Unwanted Undead Adventurer is showing how reincarnation, while a major component of isekai, is sometimes all that&#39;s needed to tell a story. 




Warning: Spoilers for The Unwanted Undead Adventurer episodes 1 and 2!!






The Unwanted Undead Adventurer is an adaptation of the original light novel series by writer Yū Okano and illustrator Jaian.




The first two episodes of Crunchyroll&#39;s new series, The Unwanted Undead Adventurer, are proving that anime where protagonists get reincarnated can still be captivating without officially being an isekai. Even though this new show would have benefited from the draw-in factor that this genre generates, the compelling struggles its reincarnated adventurer experiences are directly linked to him being from the very same world where he died.

An adaptation of the light novel series by writer Yū Okano and illustrator Jaian, The Unwanted Undead Adventurer&#39;s main form of conflict is derived from what the human Rentt Faina reincarnates into after getting killed in a dungeon – a skeleton.

          




Such an unfortunate transformation alone automatically negates the need for him to get isekai&#39;d anywhere just based on the negative stereotypes normally associated with them, unless he were transported to a world of monsters. But that would just eliminate the overall appeal of what The Unwanted Undead Adventurer is clearly trying to capture.

On the surface, the irony that Rentt becomes the very thing that adventurers kill in his own world of adventurers already proves why it was right for him to stay. However, as Rentt begins to easily surpass what he could achieve as a human, the fact that the anime has him remain in the same environment with the same rules that limited him as a human more effectively underscores how this unwelcome transformation has actually benefited him. This is especially the case because he was quite weak as a human – and now he no longer is.




Rentt&#39;s experiences in episode 2, however, really start enforcing this creative choice when a new adventurer named Rina Rupaage enters the picture. The previous episode had already established how stronger adventurers used to taunt him for being weak, so since a brand-new adventurer decides to help him despite him being a monster underscores, the anime is more effectively conveying how kind she is.

Even though Rentt is able to disguise himself, the fact that he&#39;s also known in the area understandably complicates things when he and Rina need to find shelter in the city where Rentt once worked. Additionally, Rentt&#39;s situation severely limits who he can rely on once he&#39;s there, so when he eventually ditches Rina for her own sake, the trajectory of the story is completely driven by these restrictions, which are only expected to get even more complicated as the series progresses.

The Unwanted Undead Adventurer&#39;s overall delivery serves as further justification for the series not relying on the isekai genre. Once he reincarnates, the anime&#39;s unique take on skeletons immediately presents a set of goals that viewers can depend on, giving Rentt&#39;s actions more of a purpose rather than just having him wonder around aimlessly in a dungeon. In Rentt&#39;s world, skeletons are capable of evolving, which presents him with some immediate opportunities that naturally drive the story forward.

Later, the introduction of Rina&#39;s character then provides a way for the anime to not only extend beyond its limited setting, but to do so by creating a touching friendship. Rina&#39;s unprecedented kindness and understanding of Rentt&#39;s plight understandably affect Rentt profoundly, whereby his heartfelt reactions only increase the viewer&#39;s sympathy for him. This soon exacerbates the overall blow everyone feels when he leaves Rina, upping the anticipation for them to reconnect sooner rather than later.




So, even though reincarnation is the main driving force behind The Unwanted Undead Adventurer, Crunchyroll is proving effortlessly that, while often associated with isekai, any sort of teleportation between worlds would just unnecessarily detract from its already compelling story.
