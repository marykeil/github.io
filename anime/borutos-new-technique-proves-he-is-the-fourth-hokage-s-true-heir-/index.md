## Literature Review

Boruto just used a forgotten jutsu that was the trademark of his grandfather Minato, proving he&#39;s the true heir of the Fourth Hokage.




Warning: SPOILERS for chapter #4 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex




Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has already showcased the impressive growth of its protagonist in a few chapters, but Boruto&#39;s new jutsu brings him even further, proving he is the true heir to his grandfather Minato, the Fourth Hokage.

Boruto was away from the village for 3 years, and with shinobi from around the world hunting him, he was forced to get stronger. His fighting style has shifted to that of a swordsman, and he is much smarter, constantly analyzing his enemies. Boruto has also developed new jutsu, such as the devastating Rasengan Uzuhiko, but he has clearly also been studying the techniques of his ancestors.

          

The legendary jutsu Flying Thunder God was the trademark of the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze. Boruto surprisingly shows he has mastered it in chapter #4 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, using it to teleport himself across great distances.

After being hit by Rasengan Uzuhiko, Code realized that he had no other choice but to retreat to his hideout. Thankfully, Boruto had planted a Toad on him earlier, which allowed him to monitor Code&#39;s movements. As soon as Boruto confirmed the presence of the Ten-Tails, he focused his chakra and used his teleportation technique, the Flying Thunder God, to appear at Code&#39;s location in an instant. This shows that not only Boruto has mastered a technique that his father Naruto could never use, but he also brought it to greater heights than even the Fourth Hokage did.

The Flying Thunder God, or Flying Raijin, is a legendary space-time jutsu created by the Second Hokage Tobirama Senju and mastered by Minato Namikaze, which earned him the moniker &#34;Yellow Flash.&#34; His incredible speed and deadly technique were so feared that there was a flee-on-sight order for any ninja who had the misfortune of encountering him. The technique works by instantly teleporting the user to any location where they have placed a mark, whether it&#39;s an object or a human. Flying Thunder God usually makes its user the fastest shinobi in the world, and it&#39;s impressive that Boruto has added this weapon to its arsenal.




                  Boruto&#39;s New Rasengan Is Inspired By Another Classic Shonen   Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #3 has revealed the power of Rasengan Uzuhiko, and it takes clear inspiration from a classic shonen manga.   

While Boruto says he&#39;s not as proficient with this as his grandfather, he actually uses Flying Raijin to teleport to the Kara hideout which is in another dimension, only accessible through space-time ninjutsu. Neither Tobirama nor Minato ever used the technique in this way, or to travel so far. Naruto, on his hand, never used the Flying Thunder God or even tried to master it. This begs the question of how Boruto learned this technique, and the answer may lie in his newly revealed ally, Koji Kashin. Koji is a clone of Jiraiya, who was Minato&#39;s master, so he may have some memories of the technique, but it&#39;s a shaky theory that needs to be confirmed.



 Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Keeps Making Its Protagonist Stronger 
          




What is sure is that Boruto keeps surprising readers with how powerful and impressive he has become after the time skip. Considering that he mastered his grandfather&#39;s technique, which Naruto never even tried to use, it&#39;s not far-fetched to say that Boruto has become the Fourth Hokage&#39;s true heir.
