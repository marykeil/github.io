## SUMMARY 


 Class 1-A students have become some of the strongest heroes in 
My Hero Academia
, surpassing even pro heroes, due to their practical combat experience and internships with major heroes. 
 Yaoyorozu ranks lower on the list despite her powerful Creation Quirk, as she hasn&#39;t had many opportunities to prove herself in battle.

## Literature Review

Class 1-A contains some of the most powerful characters in My Hero Academia, which has led many fans to speculate on who the strongest members are.




While they may only be in high school, Class 1-A is home to some of the strongest ranked heroes in My Hero Academia. This may be somewhat surprising given how strong some of the series&#39; pro heroes like Endeavor or Hawks are, but it is also a testament to how much these students have grown throughout the series. It is only natural after all the enemies they have had to face for them to be powerful beyond their years.
Basically from their inception, the students of Class 1-A have been targeted by the League of Villains, who are constantly trying to obtain Deku&#39;s One For All Quirk. This has given them all a fair amount of practical combat experience, which many of the students then leveraged into internships with major heroes that translated into even more combat experience. This means that even heroes with less powerful Quirks in the class can be stronger than they appear. While most of Class 1-A is very powerful for the reasons stated above, here are the 10 strongest.









 








 10  Yaoyorozu (Creati) 
Quirk: Creation
        

Yaoyorozu&#39;s Creation Quirk enables her to create various objects from her body, making her incredibly useful in pretty much any situation. However, despite her enormous potential, she has been criminally underused. She was able to help in the plan to stop Gigantomachia in the Paranormal Liberation Front arc, but beyond that, she hasn&#39;t really done much to prove herself in battle. Because of this, she ranks at the bottom of this list despite her incredibly powerful Quirk. If she does get more of a focus in the future she could easily surpass some of her fellow classmates on this list, however.





 9  Kaminari (Chargebolt) 
Quirk: Electrification
        

Just like Yaoyoruzu, Kaminari has a very powerful Quirk but hasn&#39;t received enough of a focus to rank him among Class 1-A&#39;s top-tier heroes. His ability to manipulate electricity can be used to incapacitate many enemies, and he was also placed on the front lines during the Paranormal Liberation Front arc so he could nullify another electricity user. This certainly shows that Kaminari has a lot of potential to be an incredibly powerful hero even when compared to others with a similar Quirk type. But unfortunately outside that one instance, Kaminari hasn&#39;t been seen using his powers impressively in battle, and outside that his lackadaisical attitude prevents him from unlocking his full potential in My Hero Academia.





 8  Asui (Froppy) 
Quirk: Frog
        

While Froppy may not have the most impressive powers, merely being able to mimic the jumping ability, agility, and tongue of a frog, she has more than enough experience to make her one of Class 1-A&#39;s most seasoned fighters. With her high intelligence, Froppy&#39;s innovative Quirk use can make up for her lack of inherent power. She is, in fact, able to use her Quirk similarly to how Spider-Man uses his powers despite not being My Hero Academia&#39;s most blatant Spider-Man ripoff. While she hasn&#39;t fought as much recently as compared to how often she was featured in early arcs, she still has retained the skills she gained from those early fights and she has only increased her abilities since then, earning her a decent rank.





 7  Jiro (Earphone Jack) 
Quirk: Earphone Jack
        

Initially, Jiro&#39;s Quirk seems more suited for a music career than a hero career, but the Final War arc has shown how versatile and powerful her ability can be. Earphone Jack is able to use the jacks growing from her ears to direct and channel sound at her enemies, even using her powers to strike a major blow against All For One, one of My Hero Academia&#39;s most powerful villains. To be fair the only way she was able to get so close to him was by riding on Tokoyami&#39;s Shadow, but this moment shows that if she can get close enough to an enemy she is easily one of Class 1-A&#39;s strongest heroes.





 6  Kirishima (Red Riot) 
Quirk: Hardening
        

Kirishima&#39;s Hardening Quirk makes him incredibly durable and nigh invincible to most physical attacks, naturally making his strength rank fairly well. He can even use the Quirk offensively, making his blows hit harder. But this would have likely been seen as unimpressive if he hadn&#39;t had the chance to prove how powerful he could be in the Overhaul arc, where he helped defeat a powerful member of the Shie Hassaikai. That fight pushed him to his limits, but he was still able to come out on top. Since then, he has likely only gotten stronger, gaining more battle experience and sharpening his skills further.





 5  Uraraka (Uravity) 
Quirk: Zero Gravity
        

Just like Froppy, Ochaco&#39;s Quirk may not seem like it would rank too highly for strength. She has the ability to make certain objects weightless and return their gravity when she wishes. However, as she has shown throughout the series, Uraraka&#39;s power has a multitude of applications, even allowing her to put up a major fight against Bakugo in the Sports Festival arc. Since that fight, she has only improved her powers further, training under the pro hero Gunhead and gaining a lot of hands-on battle experience. This has left her one of Class 1-A&#39;s strongest fighters, even if the nature of her Quirk prevents her from surpassing some of the others on this list.





 4  Tokoyami (Tsukuyomi) 
Quirk: Dark Shadow
        

Tokoyami easily has one of the most mysterious powers in My Hero Academia, but it also ranks among most powerful in his class. Tokoyami uses a creature of Darkness that is bonded to him to attack his enemies, enveloping them in its darkness so they can&#39;t escape. He can also use the Shadow to fly, greatly increasing his maneuverability. He also trained this power under the great hero Hawks who drastically improved his skills with it. This was dramatically shown in the Final War arc where Tokoyami was even able to briefly take down All For One using his Shadow during a climactic fight. This level of power easily makes him one of Class 1-A&#39;s most powerful heroes and if he mastered his Shadow further he could probably get even stronger.





 3  Bakugo (Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight) 
Quirk: Explosion


 







Bakugo has been one of the series&#39; main characters from the start, so it only makes sense that his Quirk ranks high for strength. His powers allow him to explode his sweat, which he can use both in destructive attacks or to increase his maneuverability. This may ultimately seem a bit one note, and in some ways it definitely is, but Bakugo has developed quite a diverse move set over his intense training and the many battles he has participated in. Bakugo&#39;s intense determination and drive have also motivated him to push himself past his natural limits, elevating him to one of Class 1-A&#39;s strongest heroes. Bakugo has recently awakened a new application of his Quirk, which allows him to take on even All For One in the climatic final battle of the series.





 2  Todoroki (Shoto) 
Quirk: Half-Cold Half-Hot


 







Todoroki has a great mix of an incredibly strong Quirk and intense training. Bred by My Hero Academia&#39;s most hated hero Endeavor to gain a Quirk that could allow him to surpass All Might, Todoroki is able to use one half of his body to manipulate flame and the other half of his body to manipulate ice. Either of these powers alone would enable him to deal with many enemies quite easily, but together they enable him to deal effectively with whatever threat he may encounter. Also by skillfully combining them he can boost the power level of his attacks in general, as he has shown in his fight with Dabi, making him a major powerhouse.





 1  Midoriya (Deku) 
Quirk: One For All


 







Unsurprisingly, My Hero Academia&#39;s main character is the strongest hero in Class 1-A, but what is surprising is the degree to which he outclasses his peers. Deku&#39;s One For All Quirk grants him access to many abilities all in one, including increased strength and speed, energy whips, danger sense, and more. All of this enabled him to actually effectively fight the rest of Class 1-A even when Deku was at his weakest during the Dark Deku arc. It also makes him the only hero in the series, including the pros, who has a chance of actually defeating Shigaraki, who has become the biggest threat in the series.
Ultimately if certain students like Yaoyorozu get the chance to show off what they can do more in the Final War arc, then this power ranking for Class 1-A could easily change. But no matter how it shifts in the future the fact remains that the students of Class 1-A are a cut above their fellow Hero high schoolers given the amount of experience they have gained. Even the least powerful of them could give other heroes a run for their money and the upper ranked of Class 1-A&#39;s strongest students could reasonably defeat most of My Hero Academia&#39;s characters.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
