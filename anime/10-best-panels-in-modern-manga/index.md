 10  Shigaraki&#39;s Realization 
My Hero Academia chapter #69
        

The creepy and bone-chilling smile of Shigaraki as he finally understands who his hate should be directed towards sums up his villainous character. He took Midoriya hostage and started talking to him about the recent rise in popularity of the Hero Killer Stain. Frustrated at the lack of attention the League Of Villains was receiving, he vented to Midoriya to understand the reason Stain was gaining fame. He finally understood the reason he disliked Stain and Midoriya - All Might. The number one hero was not just a thorn in Shigaraki&#39;s side, he was the cause of all his mental anguish. The author puts a lot of detail into the panel to emphasize Shigaraki&#39;s twisted joy at answering a question that bugged him for so long.





 9  Shin Becomes A General 
Kingdom chapter #642
        

The Warring States period in China was an era of endless conflict and casualties. Still, Shin&#39;s dream was to become a Great General. On his way to that seemingly impossible goal, he suffered a lot and lost many of his comrades. He went through hell on the battlefield, saw his brother killed in front of him, and witnessed the massacre of innocent people. These experiences fueled him to climb the ranks to stop such tragedies. Although he hasn&#39;t become a Great General yet, Shin&#39;s ascension to the rank of General remains one of the most epic moments in the long-running series. Kingdom is filled with great and epic scenes but Shin becoming a general is the culmination of everything that happened before.

 8  Luffy Attains His Peak 
One Piece chapter #1044
        

After suffering several defeats by Kaido, Luffy finally managed to awaken his devil fruit and activate his final and most powerful transformation - Gear 5. This transformation, portrayed in an over-the-top cartoonish style, was extremely popular within the anime community as it broke away from the serious and conventional style of power-ups, like in the case of Super Saiyan. Gear 5 is outlandish, yet incredibly powerful, and it puts into perspective how far Luffy has come. After a grueling battle, Luffy emerged victorious and replaced Kaido to become an Emperor Of The Sea. The Tom-and-Jerry-like transformation of Gear 5 left a lasting impression and will forever be remembered as a unique and impressive feat.





 7  Kishibe Plots Against Makima 
Chainsaw Man chapter #61
        

One of the most famous manga panels in the Chainsaw Man fandom is the &#34;Makima is listening&#34; message by Kishibe to Quan Xi. This panel is extremely unnerving as it shows how far Makima&#39;s grasp extends. Makima is one of the most powerful and scary characters in the series, and it was shocking when it was revealed that she was the main villain. It appears that Kishibe had his suspicions about her and wanted to ally with Quan Xi to take down Makima. Although negotiations broke down and the two fought, it was still a memorable moment despite how short it was.





 6  Kaneki Accepts Who He Is 
Tokyo Ghoul chapter #63
        

Kaneki still couldn&#39;t come to terms with the fact that he was a half-ghoul. Like most humans at the time, he saw ghouls as monsters that were out to get him. Only after he was brutally tortured by Jason did he realize that to protect himself and his loved ones, he&#39;d have to accept his non-human side. After a subconscious discussion with Rize and coming to terms with his mother&#39;s death, Kaneki awakened his powers and easily killed Jason. Only after he overcame his childhood trauma and disgust of ghouls was Kaneki able to achieve peace, which is a powerful metaphor for real life.

 5  Netero&#39;s Gratitude 
Hunter X Hunter chapter #291
        

In the battle between the King Of The Ants Meruem and Chief Of Hunters Netero, the latter showed how he became the strongest man alive - gratitude. He is grateful for everything in life and dedicated many years to expressing this feeling through intense training. This panel took everyone by surprise not just because of the heart sign but also the sudden and sharp improvement of the art quality as compared to the previous pages. Netero and Meruem went on to have one of the most memorable fights in Hunter X Hunter, but this moment stands out even in that epic clash.

 4  Gojo Becomes The Strongest

In a state of incredible euphoria and confidence, Gojo Satoru declared his strength that towered above everyone else&#39;s. He had finally mastered the Limitless technique and was ready for round 2 against Toji, the only man who had ever defeated him. In this awakened state, Gojo made light work of Toji and killed him. This iconic moment in the Jujutsu Kaisen manga solidified Gojo as the strongest sorcerer alive and was the catalyst for his ascent to glory. The quote &#34;Throughout the heaven and the Earth, I alone am the honored one&#34; is the perfect reflection of Gojo&#39;s extreme ego and domineering personality.





 3  Eren Achieves His Dreams

The manga portrayed him in his childhood years, where his motivation to go outside started. Although this desire was reasonable, it ended up being what motivated Eren to become one of the worst villains in all of anime.

 2  The World Shall Know Pain 
Naruto Shippuden chapter #420
        

The evil villain Pain looms over the Konoha village, and in an instant, he destroys everything, killing hundreds of people. Masashi Kishimoto is a brilliant artist and does perspective art very well, but this scene where both the village and Pain were displayed was his best. The meticulous detail that went into this double spread was what made this scene even better. The village&#39;s destruction showed just how absurdly powerful Pain was, which then made Naruto&#39;s victory over him even more impressive. Naruto is filled with great art, but the emotion invoked by Pain&#39;s speech right before this panel made it stand out as the best.

Vinland Saga chapter #96
