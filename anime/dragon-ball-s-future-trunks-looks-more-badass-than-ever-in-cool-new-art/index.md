## Literature Review

Future Trunks hails from a battle-ravaged time where he&#39;s constantly fighting for his life, with new fanart depicting him as the badass hero he is.




The Z-Warrior known as Trunks, is a Dragon Ball character who constantly needs to stay on his toes living in an alternate future decimated by a seemingly unbeatable pair of ruthless androids hellbent on destroying everything and everyone around him. And now, in a new piece of fanart depicting this half-Saiyan hero, Trunks gets a fan design that makes him even more badass than usual, which is saying something considering he’s the epitome of cool in the Dragon Ball Universe.




Recently shared on X, @DBSKAKERU1 specializes in creating Dragon Ball fanart that rivals the sketches of the series’ legendary creator Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou, the current artist for Dragon Ball Super’s ongoing manga.


 

Consistently uploading artwork of other Dragon Ball characters like Super Saiyan 2 Gohan, Super Saiyan 4 Goku, Chi-Chi (back in her formidable Z-Fighter role), Orange Piccolo from the recent Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, and even a King of the Saiyans version of Trunks that needs to be made canon immediately, @DBSKAKERU1’s newest take on Future Trunks in his “base” form doesn’t break this account’s impressive creative streak but extends it instead.

                  Vegeta Confirms Broly Isn’t the Rarest Saiyan… It’s Trunks   Despite the fact Broly is a Legendary Super Saiyan, he still isn&#39;t the rarest Saiyan in Dragon Ball, and Vegeta confirms that honor goes to Trunks.    





 Future Trunks Readies For A Fight In New Dragon Ball Fanart 
          

A character introduced in Dragon Ball Z’s Android Saga, Future Trunks was a staple hero of the series up through the Cell Games and eventually returned to the fold in Dragon Ball Super’s Future Trunks Saga, with both instances showing off what the character is capable of as a badass fighter of incredible strength and skill. On the run and worse for wear more often than not in his home timeline, Trunks is a powerful Saiyan in his own right, yet still has trouble surviving day-to-day and making ends meet, with @DBSKAKERU1 showing that struggle perfectly in this inspired piece of fanart.

Drawn with longer, tied-back hair reminiscent of Trunks’ aged-up look post-Hyperbolic Time Chamber training with his father (as seen during the Cell Saga), @DBSKAKERU1 gives Trunks a slightly battle-damaged design complete with torn and ripped clothing and more than a few deep cuts and scratches etched into his skin. Sitting on the ground draped in his iconic Capsule Corp jacket while propped up on his signature Frieza-killing sword, Trunks gives a death glare worthy of Vegeta’s own 100-yard stare as he readies himself for his next battle or, more likely, takes a breather after a hard-fought (and already won) fight.






 Dragon Ball&#39;s Future Trunks Looks Intimidating in Fan-Made Art 
          

Looking as tough as ever in either hypothetical instance, this snapshot of Trunks could have been pulled from the moment right after he finally takes out the androids who ruined his life, despite him still brandishing the sword that Android 18 shattered when Trunks used it to protect a defenseless Vegeta way back in Dragon Ball Z. Trunks is already a badass character unique to the world of Dragon Ball, and with @DBSKAKERU1’s professional-level skills and talent, he gets a fanart design that does the original incarnation of this character justice.
