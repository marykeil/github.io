## Literature Review

Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of incredible openings across its two series, but some stand above the rest as being some of the best anime OPs ever.





It can be somewhat difficult to rank these sorts of openings given that some may have great animation but a lackluster song and vice versa. In addition, given this list is considering the openings from both Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, many may feature extremely different plot elements and characters. However, this list won&#39;t be a judgment on the differences between the two series. Instead, it will measure how well each opening sets the mood for the arcs they frame and how well the animation and music work together to create a greater whole. Here are all the openings of Fullmetal Alchemist ranked from least good to best.









 








 9  Fullmetal Alchemist OP #1: Melissa 
        

The first Fullmetal Alchemist opening is iconic, but when compared to many of the other OPs in the franchise it falls flat. While the song “Melissa” by Porno Graffitti is one of the best in the franchise, the animation of the OP is unfortunately static, featuring mainly a bunch of shots of characters looking away into the distance. This makes it a decent introduction to the various important characters at the beginning of the series, but it makes it a bit bland when compared to the much more dynamic and action-packed openings that would grace the series in the future.





 8  Fullmetal Alchemist OP 2: Ready, Steady, Go 
        

The second opening of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime is one of the most beloved in the series largely because of how exciting the song “Ready, Steady, Go” by L’arc-en-Ciel makes it. The opening also features a great shot of Ed smirking at the viewers at the very start, which perfectly captures his subversive personality. The running shot partway through the opening also makes it more dynamic than the first OP. However, it is still mostly made up of static character shots which makes it visually boring compared to the other openings in the franchise.





 7  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OP 3: Golden Time Lover 
        

While this opening may not be as iconic as the previous two OPs on this list, its more dynamic transitions and more interesting character shots put it above them. The song “Golden Time Lover” by Sukima Switch isn&#39;t quite as good as in many of the other openings, but it does fit Ed&#39;s more depressed mood for the arc. In addition, his charge against Brotherhood&#39;s assembled homunculi at the start perfectly emphasizes his commitment to his goal despite his feelings of helplessness. Unfortunately despite these great moments, the opening doesn&#39;t quite top some of the other OPs in the franchise.





 6  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OP 2: Hologram 
        

Much like with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s third opening, the series&#39; second OP also has a somewhat less iconic song, this time being “Hologram” by NICO Touches the Walls. However, the upbeat tune fits the tone of the arc and the bright colors of the OP fit this as well. Additionally, unlike most of the previous openings on this list, this OP actually features some pretty awesome action shots, showing an incredibly fluid battle between Ling and Bradley as well as Ed taking on Envy and Gluttony. All this elevates it a bit above the previous entries on this list despite its lackluster music.





 5  Fullmetal Alchemist OP 3: Undo 
        

In many ways Fullmetal Alchemist&#39;s third opening mirrors the second Brotherhood OP mentioned above. Unlike the first two openings of the original series, this opening actually has some pretty dynamic transitions and shows off some pretty exciting fights. The ones between Ed, Al, and Greed and his underlings are especially great. It also features some shots of Ed and Al hanging out together, highlighting how much they care for each other. Where this opening really surpasses the previous opening on this list is its song “Undo” by Cool Joke, which is a better tune overall while also fitting the arc&#39;s mood well.





 4  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OP 4: Period 
        

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s fourth opening fully captures the grand scale of the series. Not only does it show Edward and Alphonse&#39;s experimentation with alchemy as children, but it also shows how far they have come by highlighting all the lives of those they have met and helped. Brief snippets of action scenes both provide the viewer with visual stimulation and also highlight the many fronts of the conflict between the alchemists and Father&#39;s homunculi. The way the accompanying song “Period” by Chemistry builds over the course of the OP also shows how big the plot of the show has become. All this makes Period easily one of the best OPs of the franchise, only coming in fourth on this list due to some tough competition.





 3  Fullmetal Alchemist OP 4: Rewrite 
        

Fullmetal Alchemist&#39;s fourth opening serves a similar role as Brotherhood&#39;s fourth OP, highlighting how large and exciting the conflict has become. There are two elements that elevate this opening above the last one, however. The first is the epic fight scene between Ed, Al, and the Homunculi in a massive pool of water. This scene still blows many modern-day anime fight scenes out of the water in terms of its complexity and the fluidity of its animation. The second is the iconic song “Rewrite” by the legendary band Asian Kung-Fu Generation. While this is easily Fullmetal Alchemist&#39;s best OP, Brotherhood actually has two excellent openings that somehow surpass it.





 2  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OP 5: Rain 
        

This opening serves as the emotional introduction to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s final arc, and it fits that role perfectly. After an awesome transition at the start that shows the homunculi all Morphing into each other, the opening is largely static shots of characters, which may make its placement on this list seem weird in comparison to the first couple of entries. However, the static shots here take place in the quiet moments between or after fights occur, implying the massive battle taking place while also showing the impact it is having on its characters. The rain that ties together all of these shots also shows how the conflict has truly escalated to a countrywide scale, with the fate of every character in the series on the line. This combined with the powerfully tender song “Rain” by SID truly makes this an emotional tour de force that beautifully wraps up the series.





 1  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood OP 1: Again 
        

One of the most iconic anime openings of all time, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s first OP deserves the top spot on this list. The opening expertly condenses a large amount of information into a short time frame, covering Edward and Alphonse&#39;s tragic past as well as their present conflicts. Every shot of this OP is beautifully animated, from simple clips of characters walking in fields to epic alchemy battles. Paired with the deservedly iconic song “Again” by Yui, this OP makes for an unforgettable watching experience before the show has even begun and is perfectly fitting for the beginning of a show of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s caliber.
Regardless of how the individual openings stack up against each other, each one is still better than the openings of most other anime. It is a testament to the high level of quality of both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist that fans were graced with these incredible openings that would stick with them long after the shows ended. So while these Fullmetal Alchemist openings may be able to be ranked from worst to best, each one is still a great representation of the series that fans can cherish.
