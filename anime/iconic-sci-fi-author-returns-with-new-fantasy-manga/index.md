## Literature Review

A new fantasy manga by Tsutomu Nihei, author of award-winning BLAME! and Knights Of Sidonia will debut for Kodansha.





With Shueisha&#39;s Shonen Jump releasing new manga to replace its most popular ones like One Piece and Jujutsu Kaisen, Kodansha has to follow suit if it still wants to retain its the spot as Shueisha&#39;s biggest competitor. The company will start publishing a new fantasy manga, Tower Dungeon, that seems very promising, and it will be written and drawn by none other than Tsutomu Nihei. Coming off two award-winning sci-fi manga, Nihei is ready to change genre and hopefully take the industry by storm for the third time.

 Tsutomu Nihei Moves Away From Sci-Fi To Make A Promising Fantasy Manga 

 

As reported by the reputable X account MangaMogura, the new manga titled &#34;Tower Dungeon&#34; will make its debut on October 6 in issue 12 of the Monthly Comic Sirius magazine issue. Other big manga are published in that magazine such as That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime and The Masterful Cat Is Depressed Again Today, which recently got an anime adaptation. Tower Dungeon&#39;s plot revolves around an evil sorcerer who killed the king, kidnapped the princess and hid himself in a tower with monsters roaming. A task force is created to recover the princess and a young farmer joins.

The plot seems to be close to that of the hit manhwa Tower Of God where a seemingly incapable man adventures through a mysterious tower to find a woman. Nihei is an expert at drawing buildings and architecture as he once worked in the field. His gorgeous and extremely detailed landscapes have propelled him to multiple awards and his name often comes up in conversations about the best manga artists. With the series possibly entirely set inside a huge tower, It&#39;s safe to say that the art will be nothing short of amazing.




          

The manga has already gained traction online and that shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise. Nihei is obviously super popular in Japan, but he also anticipated the popularity that manga and anime would get overseas. He lived in New York for a year, attended many comic book conventions, and even made an entire miniseries for Marvel Comics, Wolverine: Snikt!, becoming widely recognized in the international stage. Tsutomi Nihei&#39;s new fantasy manga, Tower Dungeon, has many eyes on it and the first chapter will obviously attract a lot of readers, but only time will tell if the series will live up to the expectations set up by Blame! and Knights of Sidonia.
