## Literature Review

These shows provide the perfect opportunity to sit back and relax, making viewers forget their worries, or even realize how insignificant they are.





In stark contrast with the epic sagas that take viewers on long, complicated journeys, these shows are laid-back and slow-paced, seeking not to tell a story of grandiose proportions or uniquely creative concepts, but rather to just give them the opportunity to sit back and unwind. No matter what one may be going through, these wholesome titles are sure to prove uplifting and inspiring.









 








 10  Non Non Biyori 
        

Non Non Biyori is one of the most well-known iyashikei and cottagecore titles, and for good reason. The story follows Hotaru Ichijou, as she leaves the busy life of Tokyo together with her family, moving to a small town in the countryside. Everything here is different from what she&#39;s used to, with stores not being as convenient and her classroom being significantly smaller, but these differences prove to be a source of joy rather than frustration. Watching Hotaru as she learns about rural life and explores it with the ever-curious Renge Miyauchi and the friendly Koshigaya siblings makes for one of the most peaceful and relaxing experiences the medium has to offer.





 9  Little Witch Academia 
        

Little Witch Academia follows Atsuko Kagari on her journey of becoming a witch after being inspired by the renowned Shiny Chariot during one of her spectacular performances. Unfortunately, even while attending the Luna Nova Magical Academy, a prestigious school for ambitious young witches, she is often at a disadvantage compared to her peers because of her non-magical background, thus having to work harder and learn more to keep up. While Atsuko&#39;s path may often prove to be perilous, watching her take on challenges and work hard to reach her goals is always enjoyable, and the show&#39;s fantastical setting and colorful art style further complement the uplifting ambiance.





 8  K-On! 
        

As one of the most popular shows of the Cute Girls Doing Cute Things sub-genre, K-On! truly lives up to the theme it is emblematic of. The story revolves around an ordinary school&#39;s Light Music Club, wherein high school girls learn to make music together. Some, like Mio Akiyama, are more experienced, acting as guides for the others, while Yui Hirasawa has virtually no experience with musical instruments, having to learn everything from scratch. In spite of their different musical abilities and personalities though, these girls always manage to work together and have fun, never failing to bring a smile to viewers&#39; faces.





 7  Hinamatsuri 
        

While Hinamatsuri&#39;s premise may be one of the stranger ones in the medium, the show is certain to turn any skeptical viewer into a passionate fan. The story follows two main characters, the titular Hina, a girl with mysterious origins and strange supernatural powers, and Yoshifumi Nitta, a yakuza member who suddenly finds Hina in his room one day. Due to Hina&#39;s potentially destructive powers, Yoshifumi decides to look after her, which marks the beginning of their life together. This show is not only one of the most wholesome ones out there, but also one of the best anime comedies, particularly due to supporting characters like Hitomi Mishima.





 6  Barakamon 
        

Barakamon revolves around Seishuu Handa, a budding calligrapher whose talent is only matched by his narcissism. After reacting inadequately to criticism of one of his pieces, he is sent to the Goto Islands by his father, in an attempt to make him reflect on himself and his attitude. Though he may expect rural life to be quieter than Tokyo, he soon learns not to trust his assumptions, as no moment can be quiet with energetic and cheerful children like Naru Kotoishi around. Another lesson he learns, and viewers along with him, is the importance of belonging to a community and connecting with others, instead of single-mindedly focusing on one&#39;s career.





 5  Bunny Drop 
        

Bunny Drop follows Daikichi Kawachi, who, upon attending his grandfather&#39;s funeral, learns that he had a young illegitimate daughter, named Rin Kaga, whom the rest of his family wants nothing to do with. Upset by everyone&#39;s cold attitude, he decides to start taking care of her by himself. As Daikichi was never planning, or even prepared to be a father, there is a lot he has to learn, but, thanks to his affectionate nature and genuine desire to look after Rin, his journey ends up being one of the best parenting anime. The one thing fans need to be aware of is the source material&#39;s controversial ending, which is likely best avoided.





 4  School Babysitters 
        

After losing his parents in a plane crash, Ryuuichi Kashima is left to take care of his toddler brother, Kotarou, by himself. Though the president of an elite school decides to take them under her care, her one condition is for Ryuuichi to join the school&#39;s babysitter&#39;s club, looking after his brother and other babies when possible. School Babysitters may seem to have a rather dark premise, but Ryuuichi&#39;s boundless optimism, along with Kotarou and the other toddlers&#39; adorable and remarkably expressive behavior, prove to be a recipe for a surprisingly heartwarming show, which anyone is sure to enjoy, whether they have baby fever or not.





 3  Bocchi the Rock! 
        

As the second show to revolve around music on this list, Bocchi the Rock! proves just how wonderful the power of (chart-topping) music can be. The story follows Hitori Gotou, better known by her nickname &#34;Bocchi&#34;, a girl who is genuinely passionate about guitar and making music. Unfortunately, even though she spent a lot of time practicing and even uploaded videos of her music online, she always had trouble making friends and finding a band to play with due to her social anxiety. That is, until she met Nijika Ijichi, and finally found a group who could understand her. Though she may still struggle in public, her efforts are always encouraging.





 2  Laid-Back Camp 
        

As the title implies, Laid-Back Camp is truly one of the most laid-back anime shows out there, reminding viewers to take things slowly and enjoy the simple pleasures in life. The story follows Rin Shima, a girl who is genuinely passionate about camping, even by herself, and Nadeshiko Kagamihara, who is keen on cycling and looking for opportunities to see Mount Fuji. After meeting by chance and striking up a friendship, the two of them often go on camping trips together. In a world caught up in chasing trends and keeping up with the latest innovations, this show highlights how freeing it can be to just relax and enjoy nature.





 1  Natsume’s Book of Friends 
        

Natsume’s Book of Friends revolves around the titular Takashi Natsume, a boy whose ability to see youkai has always caused him trouble, leading him to be shunned by his peers and passed around different foster homes. Upon moving to his grandmother&#39;s home, he accidentally releases a supernatural creature resembling a lucky cat and learns about the Book of Friends, which his grandmother used to seal the name of youkai she had defeated, thereafter deciding to protect it. Natsume&#39;s encounters with different spirits of the Japanese folklore are always insightful and captivating, with the show&#39;s mythological approach to the iyashikei theme resulting in a uniquely heartwarming experience.
Wholesome anime shows can take plenty of different forms, ranging from the ones that remind viewers of the tranquility of nature, to those that focus on the power of connections, community, and bringing people together through shared interests, and even some whose central theme is that of childcare. Regardless of what form they take though, these shows always allow viewers to forget about their concerns, or perhaps even realize how unimportant they may be in the grand scheme things, and simply relax. The ability to do this is what sets wholesome anime apart from all others.
