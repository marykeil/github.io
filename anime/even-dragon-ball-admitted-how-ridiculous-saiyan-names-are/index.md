## Literature Review

Fans of Dragon Ball are well aware of the comical names given to Saiyans in the series, and Dragon Ball GT calls it out with the most meta joke ever. 





Since the Saiyans were officially introduced at the start of Dragon Ball Z, fans were immediately taken aback by the oddly-sounding names they were given–starting with the very first Saiyan invader of Earth (minus Goku): Raditz.




          

The name ‘Raditz’ was seemingly derived from ‘radish’, and when Raditz got to Earth, he revealed that Goku’s real name was Kakarot, which is eerily similar to ‘carrot’. When looking at the broader franchise, it&#39;s clear that all full-blooded Saiyans are named after vegetable. Vegeta is half of vegetable, Nappa is named after a Chinese cabbage, and so on. While this little joke runs in the background of Z, it wasn&#39;t directly called out until GT.

In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 25, GT’s evil Machine Mutant, Baby, is attacking a city on Earth while possessing a seemingly normal-looking person. The reason for this calamity is that Baby’s looking for Saiyans, since merging with one would make Baby infinitely more powerful. While asking around in-between beating up random people he thinks are in his way, Baby comes across a girl who Goten was on a date with before all of this destruction and chaos began. Baby asked her if she knew where he could find the Saiyans, and she replied by telling him to go ask a vegetable vendor.






Episode 25 of Dragon Ball GT is written by Atsushi Maekawa, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation.






 Dragon Ball GT’s Meta Joke Calls Out Saiyan Names 
 Saiyan  Vegetable   Kakarot (Goku)  Carrot   Vegeta  First Half of Vegetable   Tarble  Second Half of Vegetable   Raditz  Radish   Nappa  Chinese Cabbage   Bardock  Burdock Herb   Gine  Spring Onion   Broly  Broccoli   Paragus  Asparagus   Cabba  Cabbage   Caulifa  Cauliflower   Kale  Kale   








Kale&#39;s name actually references her similarities to Broly, as kale is from the same species as broccoli.




There is no reason this young woman should have told Baby to go ask a vegetable vendor where Saiyans are, other than for the purpose of a meta joke aimed directly at the audience. Saiyans are a near-extinct alien race, one which many people on Earth aren’t fully aware of. Truthfully, many people don’t even know who Goku is as most think Mr. Satan is the best the Earth has to offer in terms of world-saving fighters. This means that Goten’s date didn’t even personally know enough Saiyans to be in on the in-universe observation of their strange names, which indicates that she was breaking the fourth wall to poke fun at the fact that Saiyans are named after vegetables.

The joke itself is easily missed as it is surrounded by the drama of a powerful, insidious force that wants to find the Saiyans and use their power for evil–but for the Dragon Ball fans who caught it, they’re assuredly glad they did as it is a hilarious moment in Dragon Ball GT that perfectly calls out how ridiculous Saiyan names honestly are.
