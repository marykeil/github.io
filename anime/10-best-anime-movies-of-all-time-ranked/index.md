## Literature Review

Anime has often produced masterful works in not only TV shows, but in movies, as well, and here are the 10 best anime movies that stand out.




Anime has never been limited to just TV shows, with the best anime movies standing out as some of the finest films ever made. That idea has become even more apparent in recent years as anime movies make their way to theaters and streaming in greater and greater frequency, and as such, they tend to receive just as much praise and attention as TV shows, if not more so.
Anime movies have long since established themselves as an essential part of the medium, and the best anime movies are ones that every fan of the medium should watch. Some of the best anime movies are part of various franchises, whether it be adaptations of manga and light novels or anime-original stories, while others are completely standalone stories supported entirely by the staff and studio behind them.

 10  The First Slam Dunk 
Based on the Manga Created By Takehiko Inoue
        

  Release Date   December 3, 2022    Director   Takehiko Inoue    Cast   Paul Castro Jr., Jonah Scott, Aleks Le, Ben Balmaceda, Aaron Goodson    Runtime   124 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Currently unavailable on streaming    
It might be relatively recent, but Takehiko Inoue&#39;s The First Slam Dunk has already earned its place among the anime industry&#39;s best films. In addition to animating the final arc of Slam Dunk, The First Slam Dunk told an original story about Ryota Miyagi. Not only were the two storylines perfectly interwoven with one another, but the music and shot composition of every scene allowed for Slam Dunk’s story to be taken to even greater heights than before. All of this was thanks to series creator Takehiko Inoue writing and directing the movie, and it all shows just how timeless Slam Dunk and Inoue’s writing, in general, has managed to be.





 9  Akira 
Based on the Manga Created By Katsuhiro Otomo


 







  Release Date   July 16, 1988    Director   Katsuhiro Otomo    Cast   Johnny Yong Bosch, Joshua Seth, Wendee Lee, Jamieson Price    Runtime   124 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
In direct contrast to The First Slam Dunk, 1988’s Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo is a classic that&#39;s aged exceptionally well. Just like The First Slam Dunk, Akira’s original creator, Katsuhiro Otomo, wrote and directed the film, and in his hands, he created a gripping cyberpunk story with writing, animation, and voice acting that still more than holds up today against modern anime. Akira is often cited as one of the major reasons that anime took off in the West, and with how much love and care is put into every scene, it’s easy to see why that would be the case.





 8  Ghost In The Shell 
Based on the Manga Created By Masamune Shirow
        

  Release Date   November 18, 1995    Director   Mamoru Oshii    Cast   Mimi Woods, Richard Epcar, Tom Wyner, Christopher Joyce, William Frederick Knight    Runtime   82 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Prime Video, Tubi    
Another older anime film that was of high enough quality to leave an impact on the entire medium was 1995’s Ghost in the Shell. Ghost in the Shell features amazing art, animation, and direction that have hardly aged in the almost 30 years since its original release, and when paired with its mature and thought-provoking story about the nature of humanity, it makes for a movie that easily stands out as one of the best in all of anime. The Wachowskis and James Cameron both cited it as major influences for The Matrix and Avatar, respectively, so its overall quality and impact on film, as a whole, cannot be understated.





 7  Persona 3 The Movie: #4 Winter Of Rebirth 
Based on the Video Game Series Created By Atlus
        

  Release Date   January 23, 2016    Director   Tomohisa Taguchi    Cast   Akira Ishida, Maaya Sakamoto, Megumi Ogata, Miyuki Sawashiro    Runtime   105 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Available for rental on Prime Video    
The Persona 3 tetralogy is often cited as one of the rare examples of a good video game adaptation, and the best showing of that was with the final film, 2016’s Persona 3 The Movie: #4 Winter of Rebirth. The animation is just as good as the previous films, but more importantly, the direction of Winter of Rebirth makes the drama and catharsis from its resolution hit even harder than the original game, thus creating a perfect conclusion to Makoto’s arc of relearning the value of life. The Persona 3 movies are a perfect substitute for the original game, and the stellar direction of Winter of Rebirth perfectly sells that.





 6  Perfect Blue 
Based on the Novel Created By Yoshikazu Takeuchi


 







  Release Date   February 28, 1998    Director   Satoshi Kon    Cast   Junko Iwao, Rica Matsumoto, Shinpachi Tsuji, Masaaki Okura    Runtime   81 Minutes    Where to Stream It   AMC&#43;, Shudder    
Over a decade since his passing, Satoshi Kon is still often hailed as one of the greatest directors in all of anime, and one of the films that best exemplifies that is 1998’s Perfect Blue. In addition to brilliantly exposing the darker elements of the entertainment industry, Perfect Blue tells a surreal and dramatic story of identity and how easy it is for someone to lose not only control of their life but their entire grasp on reality, altogether. Perfect Blue is as haunting as it is engaging, and it and the rest of Kon’s resume show why he was able to leave such an impact, even after his passing.





 5  Gurren Lagann The Movie: The Lights in the Sky Are Stars 
Based on the Anime Series Created By Studio Gainax
        

  Release Date   April 25, 2009    Director   Hiroyuki Imaishi    Cast   Tetsuya Kakihara, Katsuyuki Konishi, Marina Inoue, Yukari Fukui    Runtime   126 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Currently unavailable on streaming    
Anime compilation films have a reputation for being largely unnecessary, but one movie that perfectly refutes that idea is 2009’s Gurren Lagann The Movie: The Lights in the Sky Are Stars. Also known as Lagann-hen, not only does the movie fix the weaker elements of Gurren Lagann’s second half, but it makes the final battle both more technically impressive than the original anime and even more over-the-top than what was originally done. It goes far above and beyond what would be expected of a compilation film, and with those additions added to what already made Gurren Lagann so great, the movie is more than worth anyone’s time.





 4  Grave Of The Fireflies 
Based on the Short Story By Akiyuki Nosaka


 







  Release Date   April 16, 1988    Director   Isao Takahata    Cast   Adam Gibbs, Emily Neves    Runtime   89 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Max    
Studio Ghibli has made some of the greatest anime films of all time, and one of their best is 1988’s Grave of the Fireflies. The semi-autobiographical tale immediately establishes that there won’t be a happy ending for the protagonists, and everything that explains that is appropriately depressing from start to finish. That being said, there’s a certain beauty to be found in how much the movie refuses to shy away from the horrors of living through World War II, so as dark as it might be, Grave of the Fireflies is a beautiful film that shows just how much variety there is to Studio Ghibli and anime, as a whole.





 3  Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion 
Based on the Anime Series Created By Magica Quartet
        

  Release Date   October 26, 2013    Directors   Akiyuki Shinbo, Yukihiro Miyamoto    Cast   Cristina Vee, Christine Marie Cabanos, Sarah Anne Williams, Carrie Keranen, Lauren Landa    Runtime   116 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Available for rental on Prime Video and Youtube    
It’s very common for an anime-original series to have its story continued with a movie, and a great example of that is 2013’s Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion. Rebellion served as a sequel to Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and not only did it improve on the already creative and gorgeous animation of the anime, but it did so through a story that masterfully built off of the anime to create an incredible twist that completely changed how one should look at the series. Rebellion more than holds up a decade later, and seeing how the long-awaited sequel, Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht: Rising, continues the story will be great to see.





 2  Belle 
Original Anime Film Created By Studio Chizu
        

  Release Date   July 16, 2021    Director   Mamoru Hosoda    Cast   Kylie McNeill, Paul Castro Jr., Jessica DiCicco, Manny Jacinto, Chace Crawford    Runtime   124 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Max    
Mamoru Hosoda has become one of the most noteworthy anime film directors in recent years, and the film that speaks the most to his abilities is 2021’s Belle. The stellar visuals and storytelling that are common in Hosoda’s work are on full display in Belle, and not only does it being a musical add a lot of originality, especially with how great the songs are, but that aspect is perfectly used to carry Suzu’s character arc of regaining her self-worth. Whether it’s a moment of big spectacle or human drama, every scene in Belle is a sight to behold, and it all comes together for a truly fantastic film.
            
 
 Belle: The Anime&#39;s Biggest Differences To Disney&#39;s Beauty &amp; The Beast 
Mamoru Hosoda&#39;s film Belle takes obvious inspiration from Disney&#39;s Beauty and the Beast, but even with that, the movies differ in a few ways.








 1  The Disappearance Of Haruhi Suzumiya 
Based on the Light Novel Series By Nagaru Tanigawa &amp; Noizi Ito
        

  Release Date   February 6, 2010    Directors   Tatsuya Ishihara,Yasuhiro Takemoto    Cast   Crispin Freeman, Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, Stephanie Sheh, Johnny Yong Bosch    Runtime   162 Minutes    Where to Stream It   Currently unavailable on streaming    
2010’s The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya continues from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya with a story of existential dread that did a great job of delving into Kyon’s character and his relationships with the rest of the cast, and it did so with animation and direction that still stands out as among the best of anything Kyoto Animation has ever put out. The movie greatly improved on the original light novel, and with season 3 of the anime unlikely to ever happen, it serves as a great conclusion to the original series.
While many of anime&#39;s best movies differ in genre and release date, the things they do have in common are excelling through incredible writing, art, and animation. For the older movies, that’s helped them stand the test of time and influence many works to follow them, and for the newer ones, it’s done a lot to make them stand out right from the start and immediately become major hits. Whatever the case, the best anime movies all exemplify what makes a great anime movie and a great film, in general.
