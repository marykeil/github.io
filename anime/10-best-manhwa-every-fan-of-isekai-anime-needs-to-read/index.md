# 10 Best Manhwa Every Fan of Isekai Anime Needs to Read


## SUMMARY 


 Manhwa isekai series incorporate a unique cultural and colorful flare not commonly seen in Japanese-written isekai manga.

 Many isekai manhwa feature Korean landscapes, historical references, and elements of Murim (martial arts world) and Joseon customs, making them a big draw for readers interested in these aspects.

## Literature Review

While isekai has been popular with anime and manga for years, there are a surprising number of manhwa that pose as formidable competition.




The best isekai manhwa tell stories similar to their manga counterparts, but incorporate a unique cultural and colorful flare that isn&#39;t present in Japanese-written isekai series. Manhwa will often feature Korean landscapes and historical references that are not commonly seen in manga, making it a big draw for readers who are interested in Murim (martial arts world), Joseon customs, modern Seoul metropolitan landscapes, and more.
The term isekai is one that often comes under contention. Many series bend and shape the meaning of this term to create new stories and interpretations, which leads to questions about rebirth and time travel stories that don&#39;t specifically take a protagonist&#39;s body and move it to a different space. However, all variations of the isekai tend to attract similar audiences. For the sake of clarity and a wider variety of considerations, an isekai should be considered a series where a character is exposed to a world contrasting with their status quo.

By Ro Yu-Jin and Jeongha

 1  Solo Leveling Is the Face of Manhwa 
By Chugong, Jang-Sung-rak, and Disciples


 







Solo Leveling&#39;s popularity has always been at the head of manhwa, and even more so with the recent Solo Leveling anime adaptation, but what isn&#39;t normally considered is the series&#39; status as an isekai. Although the story follows Sung Jin-woo as he navigates a devastating post-fantasy-revolution modern world, the manhwa is actually set between multiple worlds.
Through portals from which monsters enter Earth, the universe is slowly connecting in a game-like manner that Jin-woo decidedly embraces. Beginning as a talentless hunter in a world fraught with danger, Jin-woo stumbles upon a stroke of luck that marks the beginning of a rise in strength, and the discovery of new worlds.
