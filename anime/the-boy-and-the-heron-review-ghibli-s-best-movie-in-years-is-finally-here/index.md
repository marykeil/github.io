## Literature Review

The Boy and the Heron is the long-awaited new film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and it stands out as one of their best projects in years.





The Boy and the Heron is set to officially release December 8, 2023, but it&#39;s already premiered at various film festivals around the world and has been having early previews since late November.




          

The 2023 New York Film Festival was its first premiere in the United States, and anyone who was in attendance was able to see a film that excels in story and animation to the point of only being surpassed by the upper echelon of Studio Ghibli&#39;s resume. The Boy and the Heron truly stands out as one of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s best, and overall, it&#39;s no wonder that he once considered retiring with its release.

                  Where To Watch The Boy And The Heron: Showtimes &amp; Streaming Status   Fans of Studio Ghibli&#39;s animated movies might be wondering how to watch The Boy and the Heron, Hayao Miyazaki​​​​​​​&#39;s twelfth (and newest) film.   


 The Boy And The Heron Is One Of Studio Ghibli&#39;s Best 
          




Studio Ghibli has always been famous for the stellar direction of its films, and The Boy and the Heron might be their strongest yet. In terms of animation, every scene in The Boy and the Heron boasts a level of fluidity and overall composition that surpasses its predecessors, making every scene a visual spectacle. The opening scene, with Mahito running to his mother, stands out for its creative use of colors, shadows, and choreography is nothing but a sight to behold and one of the best scenes to ever appear in a Studio Ghibli film, Hayao Miyazaki or otherwise.

The Boy and the Heron&#39;s score is also plenty commendable. Longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi has returned to provide the music, and his score does an amazing job of capturing the mood of every scene, whether it be tense, melancholy, or a rare moment of happiness among the cast. Joe Hisaishi’s score is as much of a treat in The Boy and the Heron as it is in other Studio Ghibli films, and when combined with the animation, it all comes together to give The Boy and the Heron a level of direction that stands out as one of Studio Ghibli’s best, if not the best.




                  Most Anticipated Movies Of Fall 2023   The year might be almost over, but there are plenty of exciting movies still releasing this fall. Here are the most anticipated movies of Fall 2023.   



 The Boy And The Heron’s Characters Are All Great To Watch 
         

 English Voice Cast  Luca Padovan, Robert Pattinson, Karen Fukuhara, Christian Bale, Mark Hamill   Japanese Voice Cast  Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Aimyon, Takuya Kimura, Shohei Hino   



In addition to its wonderful direction, The Boy and the Heron has incredible characters. The Boy and the Heron, much like Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s previous works, is very much a human drama, and the script appropriately does a great job of adding humanity to its cast. Mahito and Himi get the brunt of that kind of writing, with the film going to great lengths to explore their various traumas and how they react to them, but even smaller characters like Kiriko, Natsuko, and Mahito&#39;s father are still fleshed out enough to be fully defined in their own right.




The more comedic and tertiary characters are also great additions to the film. The Grey Heron serves as a great comedic foil to Mahito, and the parakeets provide plenty of levity. Conversely, the noble pelican, with what little screen time he has, does a great job of emphasizing the cruelty of the world Mahito finds himself in, and Mahito&#39;s granduncle was excellent at emphasizing the grand scale of everything beyond the human drama. Some of the characters would have certainly benefited from more development, but overall, they all formed a great ensemble for the film.



 The Boy And The Heron&#39;s Weakest Attribute Is Its Story 
          

As expected of Hayao Miyazaki, the story of The Boy and the Heron is also a great one, although it&#39;s not without its faults. Everything from start to finish is engaging, as Miyazaki explores his usual avenues of war and humanity, and the exploration of those ideas through Mahito&#39;s character arc makes for truly riveting drama. The film also takes care to balance things out with plenty of comedic and quiet moments that never overstay their welcome, all of which result in a story that’s nearly perfect with its execution of Miyazaki&#39;s ideas.




Unfortunately, the film does have a handful of shortcomings. For starters, much of the supporting cast lacks any sort of significant development, and as such, it&#39;s hard to get attached to them. The pacing of the second half is also incredibly fast, which causes things like the nature of the other world, Mahito’s acceptance of Natsuko, and the high concept nature of Mahito’s granduncle’s godhood, to end up underdeveloped and hard to explain. The Boy and the Heron still manages to bring everything together in a cohesive manner, but these points still unfortunately end up detracting a lot from it.



 The Central Theme Of The Boy And The Heron Makes The Film 
          

Above all else, the thing that best sells The Boy and the Heron is its central theme: trying to understand how to properly live. The crux of the film explores Mahito’s struggle with that idea in the wake of tragedy, something that ends up being perfectly contrasted time and again with things like Himi&#39;s acceptance of her tragic fate and Mahito&#39;s granduncle’s refusal to face reality. It makes the story incredibly relatable in ways that one might not expect from its fantastical nature, and seeing such a heavy topic be treated with such care adds a lot of depth to the film, overall.




All of that hits its peak with Mahito&#39;s ultimate resolution to accept change and continue living his life. While that might seem like an obvious conclusion, that didn’t make it any less serious, and the work Mahito needed to do to get there made the journey, and the emotional catharsis gained from the resolution, plenty worthwhile. Mahito&#39;s journey was the core of the film’s original title, How Do You Live?, and it served as a perfect answer to that question and was able to excellently cap off the film.

The Boy and the Heron was widely speculated to be Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s final film, and it would have been an amazing film to end his career on. The film wasn’t without its faults, mostly regarding its story, but with its amazing direction, characters, and universal themes more than make up for it and create a film that stands out as one of Studio Ghibli’s best. The Boy and the Heron is a film any fan of Hayao Miyazaki would be remiss to skip, and seeing how he tops something like it with his next project will truly be a sight to behold.
