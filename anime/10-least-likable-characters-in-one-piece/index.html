<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From sniveling brats to oppressive tyrants, One Piece has its fair share of unlikable and despicable but characters but these ones take the cake!</p>
<p>It is entirely possible to like a character for being an excellent antagonist, as seen with Katakuri, who despite being a major antagonist of his arc, is generally well-loved and respected for wanting a fair fight with Luffy. However, most of the least likable characters in One Piece are simply too despicable to look past despite their narrative role in the series.</p>
<p>10 Strongest Non-Devil Fruit Users in One Piece
Although One Piece contains many Devil Fruits that grant their wielders unique abilities, it also features many strong characters that don&rsquo;t use them.</p>
<p>10  Flampe</p>
<p>Charlotte Flampe is Big Mom&rsquo;s 77th daughter who was introduced in the midst of Luffy&rsquo;s battle against Katakuri in the mirror dimension during the Whole Cake Island Arc. Flampe is known mainly for her infatuation with Katakuri which borders on obsession as it pushes her to interfere in the battle out of wanting her brother to win. While wanting to help a sibling is far from despicable, Flampe is disliked mostly for her obnoxious, vain personality. What&rsquo;s worse is her infatuation quickly turns into disgust when she learns about Katakuri&rsquo;s mouth. Faced with the reality that Katakuri isn&rsquo;t as perfect as she believed him to be, Flampe turns her nose on him, going as far as to disown him and threaten to gossip about him to the rest of the family.
Safe to say, Flampe might&rsquo;ve been less unlikable if not for her shifty, petty behavior towards her own brother whom she once idolized. It also doesn&rsquo;t help her case that she comes off as quite the nosy brat.</p>
<p>9  Stelly</p>
<p>Stelly is Sabo&rsquo;s adopted brother who went on to become the king of the Goa Kingdom. Much like the rest of the nobles there, Stelly looks down on everyone else as inferior to him. Stelly is particularly condescending to Merfolk and Fishmen and holds racist, stereotypical views about them. Not only is Stelly arrogant but also snotty and extremely spoiled as a result of which he often looked down on and insulted even his half-brother Sabo from a young age. Even as an adult, Stelly&rsquo;s attitude towards Sabo remains highly contemptuous, though he did seem shocked when he learned the latter was alive and part of the revolutionaries.
To top it off, Stelly also shows signs of being power hungry, evidenced when he saw the empty throne at Mariejois and even though his actions aren&rsquo;t all that atrocious he is still among the least-liked characters in the series.</p>
<p>8  Absalom</p>
<p>Absalom was a member of the Thriller Bark Pirates with the power of the Clear-Clear Fruit and a penchant for being quite the misogynistic pervert. Even nicknamed &lsquo;Erosalam&rsquo; by the zombies at Thriller Bark, he not only used his fruit to peek at Nami while she was bathing but also abducted her and forced her to marry him all within the little time the Straw Hats spent there. More importantly, Absalom has also expressed how he liked docile women who couldn&rsquo;t fight back like Nami.
While Absalom&rsquo;s behavior is not much different from Sanji&rsquo;s who also used his Germa powers to try and spy on women at a bathhouse, Absalom doesn&rsquo;t have an inkling of respect for women, unlike Sanji. In fact, Absalom&rsquo;s obsession with wanting a bride stems not from romance but from the desire for more of a trophy than a partner which explains his unpopularity in the fandom.</p>
<p>10 Best One Piece Episodes Ranked
There are many to choose from but the best One Piece episodes have fantastic animation, epic villains, and significant events taking place.</p>
<p>7  Wapol</p>
<p>Now the owner of a massive conglomerate, Wapol is the former ruler of Drum Island and the epitome of the word inexorable. During his time on Drum Island, Wapol was a terrible ruler. Besides being incredibly selfish, he is also a huge coward who abandoned his people to fend for themselves when the island was attacked by pirates. More importantly, he destroyed the rich tradition of doctors on the island by keeping twenty of the best ones for himself and hunting down the rest. Wapol&rsquo;s self-centeredness also makes him very petty and arrogant to the point where he did not hesitate to hit a young Vivi simply because her father Cobra had admonished him.
In all, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any hope for Wapol to redeem himself. Even after losing everything he had after being defeated by Luffy, Wapol went right back to his old, arrogant self after his rise back to money and power.</p>
<p>6  Spandam</p>
<p>Spandam was the ruthless yet cowardly chief of CP9 and the man in charge of capturing Nico Robin. The dislike for Spandam mostly stems from his sadistic treatment of Nico Robin at Enies Lobby where he not only broke his promise not to harm her but also shoved her down the stairs and physically assaulted her. Spandam was ruthless in the sense that he was willing to sacrifice anything to achieve his goal—that is, except himself. When the Straw Hats attacked Enies Lobby he sent the CP9 agents and several subordinates to deal with them instead, proving to be quite the coward despite his arrogance.
Interestingly, Spandam is one of the earliest examples of the World Government&rsquo;s brand of absolute justice and highlights the worst problems with the Government, as well as its moral grayness. Together with his horrible personality and hypocritical tendencies, this makes Spandam very easy to dislike.</p>
<p>5  Arlong</p>
<p>A simple look at Coco Village and what the Arlong Pirates did to its people is enough to justify why Arlong may not be a fan favorite. Despite Arlong&rsquo;s sentiments towards humans making sense considering the tragic history of the Fishmen, it hardly justifies his actions toward the innocent people of Coco Village as well as the countless other places he ravaged. Arlong not only took all their money but also killed Bellemere and forced a young Nami into working for him. Moreover, he held the village hostage to ensure Nami&rsquo;s loyalty.
Arlong was easily one of the most ruthless, despicable antagonists of the East Blue Saga who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill even an innocent child. Considering that the Fishmen&rsquo;s past and their strained relationship with humans weren&rsquo;t explored until much later in the series, it does make sense why Arlong may be among the handful of unlikable characters in the series.</p>
<p>What Arlong Is In One Piece: Netflix&rsquo;s Live-Action Fishmen Explained
Since Netflix&rsquo;s One Piece does not explore the history and origins of Arlong&rsquo;s fish-men, it is hard not to wonder who they are and what they want.</p>
<p>4  Saint Charlos</p>
<p>While nobles are infamously snobbish as proven by Stelly, the Celestial Dragons are a whole different breed among which Saint Charlos stands out most for his arrogance, pretentiousness, and condescending attitude toward everyone around him. However, what strikes viewers the most is his general disregard for life and his poor treatment of his slaves whom he takes pleasure in abusing and tormenting. Saint Charlos represents the worst of the Celestial Dragons, their perceived superiority over every other being on the planet, and everything that&rsquo;s wrong with the World Government as well as the world of One Piece as a whole.</p>
<p>3  Akainu</p>
<p>The dislike for Akainu stems mostly from his skewed sense of justice. Akainu&rsquo;s belief in absolute justice often causes him to disregard the lives of several marines and innocent civilians. To him, any means are justified as long as he achieves his goal of terminating what he and the World Government deem &rsquo;evil&rsquo;. Akainu&rsquo;s cruelty stands out most during the Ohara Incident where he decimated an entire ship full of civilians off the chance that one of them may be a researcher. In that sense, Akainu&rsquo;s idea of justice is biased towards the Celestial Dragons he serves.
Admittedly, Akainu makes for an excellent antagonist and hardly anyone can blame him for killing Ace at Marineford as he was only doing his job. That being said, Akainu&rsquo;s blind obedience to the Celestial Dragons and his ignorance and disregard towards any other life paint him as quite the unlikable character.</p>
<p>2  Trebol</p>
<p>While most of One Piece&rsquo;s least likable characters are unlikable because of their actions or beliefs, Trebol is unlikable by virtue of how obnoxious he is. Though Trebol&rsquo;s constant interruptions during Luffy&rsquo;s battle against Doflamingo weren&rsquo;t quite as noticeable in the manga, they could not be any more infuriating in the anime. That being said, Trebol&rsquo;s obnoxious laugh and laid-back persona hide his true, insidious nature, seen when he took advantage of a young embittered and disillusioned Doflamingo and instigated him to a life of crime.
​​​​
Regardless of the role Trebol played in Doflamingo&rsquo;s childhood, the fact remains that he&rsquo;s unlikable because he&rsquo;s annoying, meddlesome, and possibly the most repulsive character in the series.</p>
<p>10 Important One Piece Characters Netflix&rsquo;s Remake Will Probably Never Show
With only eight episodes in the upcoming One Piece live-action remake series on Netflix, several important characters from the anime will be left out.</p>
<p>1  Orochi</p>
<p>Orochi is easily the most unlikable character in One Piece. In fact, if being a terrible ruler were a competition, Orochi might even give Doflamingo a run for his money. Not only did Orochi underhandedly grab the title of the shogun, but he also sold his people into slavery to a vicious pirate all while starving them by keeping all the resources untouched by pollution to himself. Moreover, Orochi turned on the only man who took him in all out of resentment and his thirst for vengeance. Yet, despite his anger, Orochi could not bring himself to face the Akazaya Nine and Oden, choosing instead to hide behind Kaido like the coward he is.
Overall, Wano&rsquo;s story is incredibly tragic, and it&rsquo;s hard to believe a man as pathetic as Orochi almost managed to destroy the entire nation which makes it all the more satisfying when Orochi finally meets his fate for his actions.
All in all, only time will tell whether any of these characters will get the chance to redeem themselves. Considering Oda&rsquo;s ability to turn characters on their head and the fact that he has surprised readers before with once unlikable characters like Franky even joining the Straw Hats, it&rsquo;s safe to say nothing is entirely impossible. Unlikely as it seems, there may even be a sliver of hope for One Piece characters like Wapol and Akainu.</p>
