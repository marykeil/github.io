## Literature Review

The Boy and the Heron has more than lived up to years of hype, and it&#39;s recently broken another record for anime films in the United States.




It’s been no secret that Studio Ghibli&#39;s The Boy and the Heron has been the company&#39;s biggest success in over a decade. In addition to receiving a Golden Globe nomination, The Boy and the Heron took first place in its opening weekend in the United States box office, the first 2D original animation to do so since 2009&#39;s The Princess and the Frog.




The Boy and the Heron is truly one of the biggest anime films in recent years, and it’s managed to reach another big milestone. As of December 17, 2023, The Boy and the Heron’s domestic gross stands at $23.1 million, giving it the highest domestic gross for an anime film that’s a wholly original property and not part of an established franchise.

          

The Boy and the Heron still lags behind many other anime films, domestically or otherwise, but regardless, it&#39;s still an amazing feat and a true testament to how great of a film The Boy and the Heron managed to be.

                  The Boy and the Heron Review: Ghibli&#39;s Best Movie in Years is Finally Here   The Boy and the Heron is the long-awaited new film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and it stands out as one of their best projects in years.

With The Boy and the Heron being such a success at the box office, that also calls to mind comparisons to other anime films. While it does have the highest domestic box office for a domestic property, The Boy and the Heron only has the seventh-highest domestic gross for an anime film, in general, and with a worldwide gross of approximately $106 million, it&#39;s the 23rd highest-grossing Japanese film of all time. Both of those statistics show that it does fall short compared to its contemporaries, but The Boy and the Heron is still a major success in its own right, regardless.

There are plenty of other noteworthy statistics about The Boy and the Heron&#39;s domestic gross. Just from its opening weekend, The Boy and the Heron was both the first-ever Hayao Miyazaki film to top the domestic box office and the first fully foreign production to do so since Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero in 2022. Even if The Boy and the Heron won&#39;t finish its run as one of the biggest anime films to be released, it&#39;s still done a lot to make a name for itself and revitalize Studio Ghibli as a brand, and that&#39;s exactly what the film needed to do after spending so many years in production.

​​​​​​​The Boy and the Heron has had great success at the box office both in and out of the United States, and it&#39;s easy to see why that is. In addition to being both the latest Studio Ghibli film and the latest Hayao Miyazaki film, The Boy and the Heron is simply a great film to watch with its stunning visuals and score, and with its emotionally resonant story about loss, it would have been stranger if it hadn&#39;t found so much success. It’s clear that The Boy and the Heron has become a smash hit, and it&#39;s a great sign of Studio Ghibli being as competent as ever.
