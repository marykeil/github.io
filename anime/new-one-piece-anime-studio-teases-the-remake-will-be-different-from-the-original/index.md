## Literature Review

Wt Studio is officially remaking the One Piece anime, and they&#39;re already teasing big changes from the original series.




Wit Studio is set to produce an official One Piece remake called The One Piece, and it’s already teasing major changes for the series. Not much is currently known about The One Piece, but based on the teaser trailer, the series will at least adapt all the East Blue saga, and if it proves to be successful, it’s bound to continue adapting even more story arcs of the manga.




Something else that’s noteworthy about The One Piece is that there’s already a promise of major changes to the story. Following the announcement of The One Piece, Wit Studio and the team involved with The One Piece said that they were determined to draw “new trajectories” for the series and looked forward to presenting Luffy’s adventures in a “new and nostalgic way”.


 

The comments were shared on X by @sandmanAP, who translated the message from Wit Studio and the anime&#39;s production team. These comments suggest a new spin on One Piece’s original story. While there are a lot of different ways to interpret that, they all leave a lot to be excited about for The One Piece’s upcoming release.


 One Piece’s Remake Can Help Streamline The Original Story 
          




The best possible outcome for The One Piece putting its own spin on the story is the idea that it can help streamline the original story. While the East Blue saga is by no means bad, it does stand at odds with the arcs that follow it for its comparative lack of worldbuilding and certain inconsistencies with the lore. This is of course normal for a series that has been around for 25 years, but it means that The One Piece has a chance to make the early parts of the story more consistent with what One Piece would do in later arcs.

From a more technical standpoint, The One Piece can also streamline the story by adjusting the anime’s pacing. One of the biggest complaints about the One Piece anime is how much padding there is, with many episodes in recent years only adapting one chapter at a time. This was motivated by a need to wait for the release of new chapters of the manga but since The One Piece doesn’t have to worry about that it can adapt the story without any of the padding and filler of the original anime.




                  &#34;It Makes Me Sad&#34;- One Piece&#39;s Remake Could Harm the Series Claims Red Animation Director   A talented animation director who played a large part in creating One Piece&#39;s anime has expressed valid concerns regarding Netflix&#39;s upcoming remake.   



 One Piece’s Remake Will Be Walking On Thin Ice 
          

Another way The One Piece can be different from the original story is by potentially changing some controversial character elements of the story. While the cast of One Piece is largely beloved, there are certain aspects of the characters that are divisive among fans and critics, notably Sanji’s behavior around women. There is a concrete chance, or risk, that The One Piece could change these elements of its characters, not unlike how the live-action One Piece made its own changes to certain characters. Such a decision would surely be controversial and divisive among the fandom.




Considering how popular and beloved One Piece is, Wit Studio will be walking on very thin ice. On the one hand, doing a scene-by-scene remake of the original anime will be considered pointless. On the other, introducing too many changes will surely anger purists. Surely, Eiichiro Oda will have absolute control over the final product (just like he did with the live-action), so any changes will have to be approved by him, which should reassure fans. Still, Wit Studio&#39;s mention of &#34;new trajectories&#34; for its remake is fascinating, and it means that The One Piece will at least try to separate itself from the original.
