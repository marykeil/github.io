## Literature Review

Chihiro Rokuhira is shounen&#39;s hottest new hero and here&#39;s how his mysterious powers and the power system of Kagurabachi work.





Kagurabachi has taken the shonen genre and the manga industry at large by storm with its baffling success within mere weeks of making its debut. While the first three chapters did put on quite a spectacular display of its tragic hero&#39;s abilities, Chapter #4 has finally given fans of the series much-needed exposition on its power system and the technicalities behind Chihiro&#39;s peculiar goldfish-conjuring katana.




                  Kagurabachi Already Proved Why It&#39;s Different From Jujutsu Kaisen   While the hype surrounding Shonen Jumpâ€™s hot new manga Kagurabachi has focused on its likeness to Jujutsu Kaisen, it has a plan to go its own way.   


 Chihiro&#39;s &#39;Black&#39; Attack Releases a Slash of Pure Spiritual Energy 
          

Chihiro&#39;s attack &#39;Black&#39; releases the pent-up spiritual energy inside his body as a long-distance slash of pure spiritual energy. As his katana is imbued with spiritual energy, making it an enchanted blade, it amplifies and channels the spiritual energy or life force inside his body into a highly concentrated mass. This concentrated energy created by the enchanted blade also takes the form of the different goldfish seen hovering around Chihiro and the blade. As Shiba explains in Chapter #4, this mass of energy is also far superior to the objects a sorcerer can create alone using solely the energy outside one&#39;s body such as the Daruma dolls created by Chihiro&#39;s opponent in Chapter #4. This attack looks a lot like the iconic Getsuga Tensho used by Bleach&#39;s protagonist Ichigo, confirming that Kagurabachi is borrowing heavily from its famous predecessors.






 &#39;Red&#39; Can Deflect and Seize Control of Attacks 
          

A more original power that Chihiro possesses is &#39;Red&#39;, a highly versatile defensive move that allows Chihiro to not only deflect attacks with a swirl of spiritual energy but also supposedly absorb them and &#34;seize ownership&#34; of other people&#39;s attacks. Based on Shiba&#39;s comments in Chapter #4, Red likely allows Chihiro to control external masses of energy other than his own which helps him deflect and redirect them though whether this ability allows him to absorb other techniques and emulate them as fans have speculated is yet to be seen.

Nonetheless, Black and especially Red paint Chihiro as quite the invincible protagonist which arguably only lends more to the hype surrounding the series given the general liking for overpowered characters in shonen. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s clear that Chihiro has yet to realize and attain his full potential. The series is also yet to reveal the attack associated with the third, multi-colored goldfish featured in Chapter #1 that utterly decimated the room full of Yakuza members as well as the significance of the three goldfish overall which seem to correspond with Chihiro&#39;s attacks by color.




All in all, Chihiro&#39;s journey to find the villainous Hishaku and the enchanted blades forged by his father has just begun, and the series likely has plenty more surprises in store. Nevertheless, it is easy to see why Kagurabachi is one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most popular series given its simple yet compelling narrative, engaging pacing, and unique art style that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and detail, so fans can only hope that Kagurabachi lives up to its hype and continues to surprise.

Kagurabachi is available from Viz Media.
