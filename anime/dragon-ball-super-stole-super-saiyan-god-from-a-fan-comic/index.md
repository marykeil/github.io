# Dragon Ball Super Stole Super Saiyan God From A Fan-Comic


## SUMMARY 



  The Super Saiyan God ritual in Dragon Ball Super was first explored in a fan-comic called Dragon Ball AF, created by Toyotarou.   Dragon Ball AF introduced a similar ceremony that required seven Super Saiyans to call Goku back to Earth, similar to how seven Saiyans are required to perform the Super Saiyan God ritual in Super.   Toyotarou&#39;s fan-comic, although not canon, showed his ability to build on Dragon Ball GT&#39;s controversial story and anticipate future power-ups, making his contributions to Dragon Ball Super meaningful.

## Literature Review

Super Saiyan God needs a specific ritual to be unlocked, and a fan-comic introducing a similar concep before Dragon Ball Super even existed.




In Dragon Ball Super, to reach Super Saiyan God form, Goku had to perform a very specific ritual with other Saiyans to help boost his power to incalculable levels, and this idea was first explored in a two-decade-old fan-comic created by current Super manga artist Toyotarou. Called Dragon Ball AF, this unfinished series introduced a similar ceremony well before Dragon Ball Super came to be, and quite possibly influenced the direction of the story Toyotarou would one day eventually become an integral part of.




Technically first seen in 2014’s Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods movie — the events of which were slightly tweaked and retold during the initial arcs of 2015’s Dragon Ball Super anime and manga series — the Super Saiyan God ritual saw Goku and “five righteous Saiyans” join together to help him transcend his limits and step into the realm of God Ki.

          

In 2003’s doujinshi (fan-comic) Dragon Ball AF, created by Toyotarou (then going by the name of Toyble) Goku is residing in the Ryu’oshin Realms, the place he follows Shenron to at the end of Dragon Ball GT, and is soon needed back in the human world, resulting in the Earth-bound Z-Warriors enacting a special ritual requiring seven Super Saiyans to call him home.




                  Super Saiyan 4 Was Almost Dragon Ball’s First Super Saiyan God Form   Super Saiyan 4 looks a lot like how many Dragon Ball fans would picture a Super Saiyan God, and one Dragon Ball GT episode reveals that it almost was.   


 Dragon Ball AF Introduced a Version of the Super Saiyan God Ritual Before Super 
          

This similar ceremony consisted of Gohan, Goten, Vegeta, Trunks, Bra, Pan, and a revived Broly joining forces to rejuvenate the seven inert Dragon Balls by pouring their Super Saiyan energy directly into them. And since Goku, as explained in this doujinshi, is now the living vessel for Shenron’s spirit post-GT, the completion of this ritual would allow him to be summoned to Earth and thus, back into the fight against his lab-created biological son, the vicious villain named Xicor.



Toyotarou never finished Dragon Ball AF, so its fifth volume consists only in rough drafts.







Although this ceremony is one that didn’t yield the same results as Super’s God-like transformation, Dragon Ball AF’s version similarly required six Saiyans, plus Goku to make seven, to pull off correctly and also helped bring Goku back into the fray in a way that evened the playing field against an incredibly powerful enemy. Furthermore, by introducing this rite, Toyotarou took Dragon Ball GT&#39;s divisive story and built on its foundations in meaningful ways that felt right at home in the Dragon Ball universe, no doubt inspiring his professional work on the series years later.

So while this fan-comic and its post-Dragon Ball GT story isn’t canon, having one of the creative minds behind Dragon Ball Super’s manga run come up with an eerily similar ritual featuring the use of multiple Saiyans way before it ever became a thing in official lore is far too coincidental to ignore. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that Dragon Ball AF also anticipated a Vegeta power-up later shown in Super, meaning that the young author, while mostly working under the supervision of Akira Toriyama, is surely bringing his own ideas to Dragon Ball Super, much to the delight of fans of his early works.

Dragon Ball Super is available from Viz Media and Manga Plus.
