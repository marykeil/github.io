## Literature Review

The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #10 will feature Shadow arriving in the Oriana Kingdom to confront Princess Rose about her betrayal.




With episode #9 establishing the premise for the next arc of The Eminence in Shadow Season 2, episode #10 is set to involve Cid in a major political conflict. It also will likely continue to explore Rose&#39;s character, which will be refreshing after her long absence from the series. It may also involve more members of Shadow Garden given Rose&#39;s potential betrayal of that organization.

 What Happened In The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #9? 
          




Episode #9 focused largely on Rose and her unit in Shadow Garden. They were recruited by the unpredictable Shadow devotee No. 559 to spy on the Cult of Diabolos as they enacted a ceremony. Upon seeing her mother taking part, Rose stepped in to protect her and thus betrayed her allies in Shadow Garden. This led to her being taken back to the kingdom of Oriana and betrothed to the evil Doem Ketsuhat. Upon hearing this news, Shadow furiously rushed off to confront her, wondering why she had apparently given up on her convictions. His unexpected passion in this moment once again shows why Shadow is such a chaotically great hero.



The episode also featured some clever nods to the original Web Novel






 The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Episode #10 Will Have Shadow Confront Rose 
          




Given Shadow&#39;s frustration with Rose at the end of episode #9, he is almost certain to have a very charged discussion with her at the start of episode #10. However, given his anger stems from her apparent loss of ambition instead of the sting of betrayal, he may not punish her in the way that 559 is expecting. This could lead 559 to try and take revenge on Rose for Shadow, which could cause another fight between the two. Rose&#39;s fiancÃ© Doem likely also won&#39;t be pleased by Shadow&#39;s interference and will likely try to muster his political power to make things difficult for him in the capital.

This new arc has the potential to be the best of the season given the way it is building on past character development and worldbuilding. If it does live up to its potential, it will further cement The Eminence in Shadow as a modern classic isekai. The events of The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #10 will be a good indicator of the overall quality of this arc and also hopefully provide some great moments between Cid and Rose.
