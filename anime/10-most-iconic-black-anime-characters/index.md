He doesn&#39;t put in nearly as much work as others, but will still easily beat them in a game.
Aomine&#39;s drive for basketball went down when he realized nobody could challenge him, but when he played Kagami, his true skills were put on display.

However, that doesn&#39;t mean he is a coward; far from it. He is one of the bravest because he faces his fears for the sake of his friends and what&#39;s right.
