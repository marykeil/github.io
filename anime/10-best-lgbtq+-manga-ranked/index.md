## Literature Review

Even in a medium that may seem open to all kinds of stories, LGBTQ representation isn&#39;t always the best, but these titles succeed where others fail.




As diverse and creative as the industry may be, it can prove surprisingly difficult to find instances of genuine, well-written queer representation in manga. However, some truly special titles go above and beyond in terms of realistically depicting the experiences and struggles of queer people, and these are some of the best LGBTQ&#43; manga thereof.
Even in a medium where same-sex romance has long been commonplace, well-meant LGBTQ&#43; representation that does not rely on stereotypes can still be tricky to find. This is especially true for transgender, non-binary, and other queer characters who are hardly ever present in manga, making the titles that do depict such characters realistically that much more important and praiseworthy.
