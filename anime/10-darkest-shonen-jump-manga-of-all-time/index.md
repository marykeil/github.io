 10  Jujutsu Kaisen 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 2018 - present
        

As a title that has been gaining traction at a staggering rate, particularly due to the popularity of its excellent anime adaptation, Gege Akutami&#39;s Jujutsu Kaisen may not be the most original work ever, but it is certainly one of the most enjoyable and captivating dark stories out there. The titular Jujutsu sorcerers are humans who wield various mystical arts to fight Curses, powerful yet mysterious monsters who have been secretly terrorizing humanity from the shadows for ages. From its unique power system to the immersive world-building and intriguing story developments, there are plenty of reasons why fans fell in love with this work.





 9  Dandadan 
Shonen Jump&#43;, 2021 - present
        

Yukinobu Tatsu&#39;s Dandadan revolves around an odd pair, formed of a girl who believes in ghosts but not in the occult, and a boy who is obsessed with the occult but shows no regard for ghosts. After the two meet by chance and share their beliefs, they embark on a quest to disprove each other&#39;s theory, by visiting different locations. However, as they do so, they realize that neither of them was wrong all along. From the artwork to the storytelling, and even the way it handles comedy, this title is excellent all-around, but it can also get surprisingly dark when readers least expect it.





 8  Fire Punch 
Shonen Jump&#43;, 2016 - 2018
        

As somewhat of a predecessor to the incredibly famous Chainsaw Man, Tatsuki Fujimoto&#39;s Fire Punch proves that the author always had an inclination and talent for dark supernatural stories. In a freezing world nearly brought to ruins by the Ice Witch, a powerful &#34;blessed&#34; being born with supernatural powers, her actions lead to every other blessed being targeted and persecuted, including the innocent ones who want nothing but to survive. Such is the case for Agni, an orphan driven by vengeance after losing his sister. This title can be controversial at times, with opinions on it ranging from overrated to masterpiece, but it is undoubtedly dark and depressing.





 7  Undead Unluck 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 2020 - present
        

Yoshifumi Tozuka&#39;s incredibly creative Undead Unluck makes its unique premise surprisingly clear from the title; it&#39;s all about an undead boy and an unlucky girl. Fuuko Izumo has been long afflicted by a condition that causes great misfortune to anyone who comes in contact with her, even going as far as to result in their deaths. Her parents were no luckier, having lost their lives to the effect of this curse as well. Meanwhile, Andy, despite desperately wanting to die, is simply unable to do so, which is why Fuuko decides to help him, having finally found a benefit to her unfortunate condition.





 6  D.Gray-man 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 2004 - 2009; Jump Square, 2009 - present
        

As one of the older titles on this list, Katsura Hoshino&#39;s D.Gray-man started being published long before dark stories were trending in the shonen manga demographic. While this means that it was likely overlooked by many who weren&#39;t interested in unusual approaches, it also made the experience that much more impactful and memorable for fans. The story takes place in a world defined by the conflict between &#34;Akuma&#34;, evil beings led by the Millennium Earl, set to destroy humankind, and exorcists, humans who wield divine powers in the form of &#34;Innocence&#34;, working for the Black Order to protect the world, no matter what tragedies they may encounter along the way.

 5  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 2016 - 2020
        

Koyoharu Gotouge&#39;s Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba wastes no time to prove just how dark and sad it can be, as its very beginning consists of a tragedy. Living with his family on a remote mountain and working as a coal seller, Tanjirou Kamado&#39;s life may not be one of wealth and comfort, but he&#39;s satisfied being able to stay by the side of his loved ones. However, his peaceful life is suddenly ruined when a malevolent demon slaughters his entire family and turns his younger sister into a demon herself, forcing him to set out on a dangerous journey, fraught with twists and tragedies.





 4  Hell&#39;s Paradise: Jigokuraku 
Shonen Jump&#43;, 2018 - 2021
        

Hell&#39;s Paradise: Jigokuraku became famous as one of the &#34;dark trio&#34; of manga that revolutionized Shonen Jump, and has recently experienced a new surge in popularity thanks to an excellent anime adaptation. Gabimaru the Hollow is an infamously vicious ninja, known for his ruthless efficiency and emotionless attitude. As he is betrayed and given a death sentence, he is sent with other death row convicts on an impossible mission in exchange for their freedom, to recover the elixir of life from an island believed to be Paradise, which is actually a nightmare landscape ruled by immortal monsters, turning the story into a horror survival game.





 3  The Promised Neverland 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 2016 - 2020
        

As a psychological thriller that focuses on the theme of survival, there are few titles that can invoke as much dread as Posuka Demizu and Kaiu Shirai&#39;s The Promised Neverland does. The story follows a group of orphans who initially seem to live comfortable lives at the Grace Field House, learning and playing together without a worry in the world. However, their situation soon reveals itself to be much darker than anyone could expect, as the kids learn the truth that they are only being raised to be fed to demons. Even without any allies by their side or knowledge of the outside world, giving up is not an option. Even after the group escapes the orphanage, the manga only gets darker.





 2  Chainsaw Man 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 2018 - 2020; Shonen Jump&#43;, 2022 - present
        

Chainsaw Man is the most popular title of the dark trio, and it is not difficult to see why. Written and drawn by Tatsuki Fujimoto, who has proven his mastery over various genres through titles such as Goodbye, Eri and Fire Punch, Chainsaw Man surprised the world by proving just how dark and gruesome shonen manga can be, redefining the genre both in terms of visuals and the psychological themes it covers. The titular chainsaw-wielding protagonist Denji lived an unfortunate life, being forced to work for the yakuza until they decided to kill him. However, instead of dying, he merged with his pet devil Pochita, and became a hybrid.





 1  Hunter x Hunter 
Weekly Shonen Jump, 1998 - present
        

As a title that was released long before bleak and dreadful situations became commonplace in shonen manga, Yoshihiro Togashi&#39;s Hunter x Hunter could be said to have paved the way for stories like the &#34;dark trio&#34; to become as highly regarded as they are, influencing them in the process. While other Shonen Jump protagonists face their own share of setbacks and obstacles, the journey of Gon Freecss often takes him to perilous places, proving exactly how dangerous the world of Hunters is. From tragic backstories to gruesome deaths, there is no limit to just how dark the story can get, especially when it comes to the infamous Chimera Ant arc.
Typically setting their stories in dangerous and fantastical worlds, these manga titles understand that the best way to make viewers understand how dark their worlds are is to showcase tragedies boldly, without hesitating to put even their protagonists in psychologically scarring and life-threatening situations. Unlike the classic shonen worlds where death is but a myth and the good guys always win, these stories feel real, and the stakes are always high, which is what allows the darkest Shonen Jump manga to stand out from the rest.
