## Literature Review

2024 promsies a robust catalogue of brand new anime to keep fans&#39; watch-lists full during the new year, including highly anticipated titles.




While 2023 has marked yet another successful year for the anime industry, with series like Oshi No Ko breaking world records, the most anticipated anime of 2024 promise to top that success. With the medium growing in popularity every year, so comes an increased number of entertaining series worthy of viewer&#39;s attention. Moments of intense action with fluid animation, hilarious situational comedies, and heartbreaking dramas are set to entertain fans of every anime genre in 2024.
As great anime continue to be released, the public&#39;s open-mindedness towards the medium grows. New series like Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead provided a gateway for horror comedy fans into anime, and long-running series like One Piece consistently spoiled fans caught up with the series, with an epic and incredibly well-produced conclusion of the Wano arc. Still, those great series may be surpassed by what 2024 has in store.









 








 10  Joker &amp; Harley Quinn Go To Another World In Suicide Squad Isekai 
The release date for Suicide Squad Isekai is currently TBD in 2024


DC&#39;s Suicide Squad has had its share of stories adapted in the past decade, but Suicide Squad Isekai presents the unlikely heroes like never before. First announced by Crunchyroll during Anime Expo 2023, the new series will follow Harley Quinn and The Joker as they are somehow sent to a fantasy world with Suicide Squad members like Clayface, King Shark, Peacemaker, and more. While the ever-popular isekai genre often sends the main protagonists to a strange new world, few stories feature such chaotic – and iconic – pre-established characters being thrust into a fantasy setting, making Suicide Squad Isekai a project that&#39;ll likely entertain fans of both DC and anime alike.





 9  The Devil May Cry Anime Can Be The Next Great Video Game Adaptation 
The current release date for the Netflix Devil May Cry anime is TBD in 2024


The incredibly stylish and over-the-top Devil May Cry series is filled with larger-than-life creatures, cool weapons, and a cocky protagonist in Dante. Such ingredients would make a fun action anime, which producer Adi Shankar (of Netflix&#39;s Castlevania and Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix series fame) is setting out to accomplish. While not much information on the Netflix Devil May Cry anime has been released, Shankar has ensured excited fans that they can expect the half-demon/half-human brothers Dante and Vergil in an adaptation that will likely honor the beloved Capcom series much like the Castlevania anime did for its source material.





 8  The Egghead Arc Is One Of One Piece&#39;s Most Satisfying Arcs 
One Piece&#39;s Egghead Arc will begin airing on January 7, 2024


While 2023 was the One Piece franchise&#39;s biggest year yet, with events like Gear 5 Luffy&#39;s debut bringing about the conclusion of the stunningly animated Wano arc, the next arc might surpass it. Manga readers have been delighted by Eiichiro Oda&#39;s Egghead Arc, and without spoiling things for anime-only fans, it&#39;s been one of the franchise&#39;s most satisfying thanks to shocking revelations and surprising battles that quickly begin to top one another until the series&#39; ultimate villains finally reveal themselves. Time will tell if the high bar set by the anime&#39;s Wano finale will be able to be topped by One Piece&#39;s Egghead Arc.

 7  Dandadan&#39;s Offbeat Style Is Set To Defy Anime Fan Expectations 
The release date for Dandadan is currently TBD in 2024


Dandadan is a manga series that&#39;s risen in popularity at an impressive rate since it debuted in June 2021. The offbeat and stylish series follows two high school students who make a bet on whether aliens or ghosts are real, a bet that would take them both on a larger-than-life adventure. Hot off the incredibly fun Scott Pilgrim Takes Off anime, Science Saru is working on an anime adaptation that will take viewers out of this world with its completely wild story and outrageous visuals.
Known for its impressive art, high-octane action, and great character development, Dandadan is surely a sleeper hit manga that will be catapulted to notoriety thanks to this anime adaptation.





 6  Bleach&#39;s Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 Will Reach Godly Levels 
The current release date for Bleach: TYBW Part 3 is TBD in 2024


The resurrected Bleach anime continues to dazzle audiences with its stylish and well-directed adaptation of the epic final arc, The Thousand-Year Blood War. While the manga&#39;s original ending was considered rushed, Bleach&#39;s anime has confirmed it&#39;s different with improvements to the story. Bankai action that was never shown before and an added focus on beloved characters have helped breathe new life into the franchise. Unfortunately, the arc&#39;s ultimate antagonist, The Quincy King Yhwach, aims to reshape all life in his image, and the events of Part 3 of Bleach: TYBW might see him do it.

 4  My Hero Academia Season 7 Will Be The Beginning Of The End 
The release date for My Hero Academia Season 7 is currently May 4, 2024


The previous season of My Hero Academia&#39;s anime adaptation concluded the anticipated and emotional Vigilante Deku arc, which was a mere appetizer for the events that are to follow. Manga readers have been spoiled by the following arc that season 7 of the My Hero Academia anime is preparing to adapt. With All For One free and Shigaraki continuing to grow even more powerful – Deku, Bakugo, and the rest of Class 1A have a lot to contend with in the beginning of what seems likely to be the final battles in the super-powered shonen series.

Solo Leveling, much like One-Punch Man, began as a webcomic and grew to such high acclaim that further adaptations became inevitable. Now, the same anime studio that adapted Sword Art Online and Nier: Automata Ver1.1a, A-1 Pictures, is creating what will likely be the first hit anime of 2024. Solo Leveling follows the world&#39;s weakest hunter as he works to get stronger in order to provide for his family. However, after a near-death experience, Jinwoo is granted a power that allows him to level up like no other and become a fighter determined to become the best in the world.





 2  Demon Slayer&#39;s Fourth Season Adapts One Of Its Best Arcs 
The current release date for Demon Slayer season 4 is Spring 2024


The Demon Slayer anime adaptation has made waves worldwide with its three previous seasons and feature-length films. The incredibly dramatic and action-packed series tells the tale of Tanjiro and his quest to find a way to revert his demon sister into the human girl she once was. Season 3&#39;s shocking ending left many questions unanswered and teased a massive threat that Tanjiro, his sister Nezuko, and the surviving Demon Slayers will need to prepare for in season 4 of Demon Slayer when it begins in Spring 2024.

Dragon Ball Daima is an entirely new anime and story featuring Goku, Vegeta, and many other beloved characters from the franchise.
