## Literature Review

Studio MAPPA has been criticized for creating a toxic work environment, and a recent meltdown by Jujutsu Kaisen animators perfectly highlights that.




For years, Studio MAPPA has received criticism for their allegedly poor treatment of animators, with Jujutsu Kaisen season 2’s production issues being the most recent and the most publicized. Numerous animators who have worked on season 2 have come out to claim the studio has given them short deadlines and poor compensation.




Despite critical acclaim and a number of high-profile titles such as Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, and Attack on Titan, MAPPA has come under fire from many of its workers. MAPPA animator HoneHone recently commented on Jujutsu Kaisen season 2’s production, claiming an unreasonably tight schedule.


 


The worst thing is when all the staff work hard to complete a schedule that would normally be impossible to meet in time, and the people above them look at the results and think, ``I can&#39;t say anything!&#39;&#39; and fail to make improvements. I guess the cycle started when I completed one movie in four months...


More than that though, they also claim that the issues started when Jujutsu Kaisen 0 had to be finished in only four months, which is a tight schedule for a project as big as a high-profile movie in an established franchise.





 Jujutsu Kaisen Animators Allege Crunch From MAPPA 
          

The factor that’s been at the center of the recent meltdown is the animators being overwhelmed by the short production schedule and alleging that they&#39;re not receiving proper support for the intense workload.


 


Bad news has arrived and I&#39;m suddenly overwhelmed. The most boring ending I can think of. Ah, the festival is over. Yes, disbanded. Disbanded.


One animator, Barikios, commented on receiving “bad news” in reference to Jujutsu Kaisen season 2&#39;s schedule and called for the team to disband. Another animator, Amphibi, just said “Owarida”, the Japanese word for “It’s over”.





 

Unfortunately, it appears as though issues with Jujutsu Kaisen and Studio MAPPA go back even further than this. One prominent animator, Itsuki Tsuchigami, has repeatedly expressed disappointment with MAPPA.


 


I didn&#39;t think so much about the previous work, but it makes me really uncomfortable to hear people praise the company&#39;s name for the good things about the current work. Those who should be praised are the director who moved around to gather outside contractors and people, and each department within the company, including production and filming, who persevered.







 How Jujutsu Kaisen’s Production Issues Could Impact Season 2 
          

With how massive the latest meltdown by Jujutsu Kaisen animators has been, that naturally calls into question how the rest of season 2 will be impacted. Season 2, episode #17 should already be in production, so these most recent frustrations from the animators are likely to only impact episode #18, onward. Studio MAPPA has long since been at the center of the criticisms of modern anime production, and everything that’s happened with Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 shows that reputation will hang over the studio for some time.

Jujutsu Kaisen releases new episodes Thursdays on Crunchyroll.
