## Literature Review

Right after the dramatic finale of the second season of Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War, part 3 has been announced.





Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War is an adaptation of the popular manga Bleach by Tite Kubo. Airing from October 2004 to March 2012, the original anime ended without adapting the final arc of the manga. Fans of the franchise were understandably ecstatic when a new anime arrived to finish the project in 2022. The whole series is split up into four parts and with the first two now done, the second half is slowly approaching and will surely be a headliner in the anime-packed year of 2024.




                  Prequel Anime to Bleach Creatorâ€™s Followup Officially Announced   New episodes of Burn the Witch, by the creator of Bleach Tite Kubo, have been announced more than 2 years after the first season aired.    


 Bleach Will Make Its Return In 2024 With Part 3 Of Thousand-Year Blood War 

 

The official X account of Viz Media has just released a gorgeous and dramatic teaser for what is to come in the third part of Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War - The Conflict. The minute-long teaser shows the main villain Yhwach and Squad Zero&#39;s captain Ichibe facing off, in the most anticipated fight since Yhwach versus Yamamoto. The teaser also shows Ichigo and his crew rushing into the castle of the Soul King, which falls down soon after. The teaser does the highly anticipated sequel justice and excellently portrays the violence and action that is about to ensue.




The website of the anime released a key visual alongside the exciting news, depicting the future Quincy King Uryu Ishida standing in front of a blue background with his bow drawn. This season hasn&#39;t seen much action from Uryu so the next will most likely see him in battle and showing off his new powers. The series is scheduled for 2024, and while no specific release date was made public, fans can expect it to be announced most likely during the 2024 Jump Festa where Bleach will have a stage.

Fans of Bleach have been treated to a grand finale with two episodes broadcast in sequence, and they are already building up wxcitiement for the next installment in the series. With 2024 set to feature an amazing anime lineup, including some hot new series such as Solo Leveling and Kaiju No. 8, the new season of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is still a contender for being a headliner, considering the amazing quality delivered until now.
