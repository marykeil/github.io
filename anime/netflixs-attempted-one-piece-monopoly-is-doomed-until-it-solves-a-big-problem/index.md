# Netflixs Attempted One Piece Monopoly is Doomed Until it Solves a Big Problem


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix&#39;s slow release schedule for One Piece hinders its ability to monopolize the franchise.   To truly have a monopoly on One Piece, Netflix needs to release story arcs at a faster rate and transition to weekly releases.   Netflix&#39;s historically sluggish release of anime shows a need to overhaul their release model for One Piece and capitalize on the franchise&#39;s success.

## Literature Review

Netflix is steadily becoming more involved with One Piece, but its monopoly over the franchise has one fatal flaw that needs to be fixed.




It&#39;s become abundantly clear that Netflix is trying to build a personal One Piece monopoly. With the service having both the anime and the highly successful live-action adaptation, not to mention how it will be home to the upcoming animated remake titled The One Piece, it&#39;s easy to see Netflix making a big push to become the go-to place for all things One Piece.




If Netflix really is trying to monopolize One Piece, however, then there&#39;s a big problem that needs to be addressed before they can take any real steps forward. On a surface level, Netflix’s One Piece library is roughly the same as Crunchyroll and other major anime streaming sites, and having so many other unique programs to choose from, animated or otherwise, would make it an ideal site to go to for watching any version of One Piece.

          

However, there&#39;s a fundamental problem in how Netflix distributes One Piece, and unless it takes strides to fix that, it will never truly have a monopoly on the franchise.

                  &#34;It Makes Me Sad&#34;- One Piece&#39;s Remake Could Harm the Series Claims Red Animation Director   A talented animation director who played a large part in creating One Piece&#39;s anime has expressed valid concerns regarding Netflix&#39;s upcoming remake.   





 Netflix Is Too Slow To Have A True Monopoly

The main problem with Netflix&#39;s attempts at building a One Piece empire is a simple one: Netflix is too slow with its releases to make it work. At the time of writing, Netflix only has up to the Impel Down arc of the One Piece anime available for streaming, and they only add one story arc at a time every few months or so. That&#39;s an incredibly slow release rate for a show as long and popular as One Piece, especially when Crunchyroll already has every episode with weekly releases, so Netflix can&#39;t be the primary home of One Piece without changing its overall structure first.

As for how Netflix would change its structure for One Piece, that would ultimately be very easy to do. The biggest problem with Netflix&#39;s handling of One Piece is how slow their release schedule is, so to fix things, Netflix needs to release story arcs of One Piece at a much quicker rate until they&#39;re completely caught up and can transition into weekly releases of new episodes. Doing that would completely avert the issue with Netflix&#39;s handling of One Piece, and it would go a long way towards making their monopoly of One Piece in both animation and live-action a reality.




                  One Piece Fans Have One Major Concern About Netflix&#39;s Anime Remake   The studio behind Netflix&#39;s new The One Piece anime has previously used AI, and some fans are worried the controversial tool will be used again.   



 Why Is Netflix&#39;s Release Model For One Piece So Bad?

Netflix needs to overhaul its release model for One Piece if it wants to truly monopolize the franchise, and that begs the question of why it&#39;s been so bad to begin with. Netflix is famous for popularizing the binge model of streaming and sticking to it so many years later, and whenever Netflix licenses an anime, it usually sticks to the binge model, as well. One Piece is just one of many anime on the platfotm to be subjected to their adherence to binge viewing, and that&#39;s caused the anime to have such poor handling on Netflix for many years.




That being said, Netflix has gotten better at how it handles anime. Series like Vinland Saga and the upcoming Delicious in Dungeon all show that Netflix has started changing how they handle anime, so something similar could happen with One Piece that leads to story arcs being released in quicker succession until they can do weekly releases. Something like that would work wonders to capitalize on the success they’ve had with One Piece from the live-action series, and the success they&#39;re bound to have with The One Piece, and if Netflix follows through on it, then it would be a surefire way of securing a monopoly on the franchise.
