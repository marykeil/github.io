## Literature Review

Whether they were subject to physical or emotional abuse, or they had to experience betrayal and trauma, nothing could break these anime heroes&#39; will.





However, what separates these characters from others is that they never give up, no matter what perils await them, or what situations they had to experience. Often defined by their unbreakable determination and inspiring willpower, there is nothing that can stop them from achieving their goals. The fact that they continue to move on when most would give up is what truly makes them the most resilient ones.









 








 10  Hyakkimaru (Dororo) 
        

Dororo&#39;s main protagonist, Hyakkimaru, is a ronin whose life is defined by tragedy and abandonment. In exchange for power and the prosperity of his land, his father made a pact with twelve different demons, allowing them to take his newborn&#39;s son body parts and skin. As such, his very survival seems to defy all reason, as he remains alive even without any senses. Saved and given prostheses by Jukai, a doctor driven by the desire to redeem himself for his past deeds, Hyakkimaru learned to fight and set off on a journey of revenge, seeking to regain everything he&#39;s lost, proving his determination in spite of his cruel fate.





 9  Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece) 
        

As the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, Monkey D. Luffy is driven by the desire to find the legendary One Piece treasure and become the Pirate King. To this end, he embarks on a highly perilous journey of epic proportions, inspiring his crewmates with his confidence and boundless optimism. Thanks to his unbreakable willpower, he has successfully endured plenty of trials and dangers that not many could handle, whether in the form of powerful enemies, lethal poison, near-death experiences, or the loss of his beloved brother Ace. Moreover, he has also proven himself not to fear death, laughing in the face of executions. Luffy will go to any lengths for his friends and his dream.





 8  Ken Kaneki (Tokyo Ghoul) 
        

Even before becoming a half-ghoul, Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s protagonist Ken Kaneki was always an altruistic person, willingly taking the blame for others&#39; actions and always going out of his way to ensure he wasn&#39;t hurting others, no matter how much he had to suffer for it. Although his kindness and compassion towards his friends and allies remained unchanged, his personality shifted after undergoing intense torture, becoming more merciless towards his enemies. As a shy and gentle person, Kaneki struggled to understand the world of ghouls, but he eventually adapted and thrived in it, proving his determination and endurance, even when facing tough battles or cruel torture.





 7  Subaru Natsuki (Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-) 
        

As one of the best isekai anime ever, Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- does not feature the typical overpowered protagonist, instead following a hero whose only granted power upon being transported to a different world is that of going back in time once he dies. Given the horrifying condition of this ability, it should come as no surprise that Subaru Natsuki ends up facing various dangerous situations. However, no matter how many times he falls into despair, even when the one he loves seems to vanish, with her name and memories being devoured, Subaru is always ready to start over and keep moving.





 6  Senku Ishigami (Dr. Stone) 
        

The world of Dr. Stone is defined by sudden global petrification, which destroyed most of what humanity had built and completely reset all human progress. Waking up in a strange new world, bereft of all the comfort, safety, and convenience one is used to, would prompt most people to be terrified or hopeless. However, Senku Ishigami is anything but that. Using his genius intelligence, he decides to save all of humanity, single-handedly trying to rebuild civilization. Senku&#39;s mental resilience also proves to be extraordinary, as he retained his consciousness even while petrified, always counting time and keeping track of changes.





 5  Takemichi Hanagaki (Tokyo Revengers) 
        

Tokyo Revengers&#39; Takemichi Hanagaki may not be the strongest anime protagonist, with him constantly losing fights and being dubbed the &#34;Crybaby Hero&#34;, but his resilience and endurance are nearly unparalleled. No matter how many hits he takes, whether he&#39;s stabbed in the hand or shot in the foot, he continues to run on and fight, never giving up on his mission. Having the ability to travel back in time, he makes numerous attempts to save his first love from certain death, only to witness the results of his failures time and time again, yet nothing is enough to stop him. Even when facing the toughest of foes, Takemichi refuses to back down.





 4  Shirase Kobuchizawa (A Place Further Than The Universe) 
        

Given the more grounded nature of A Place Further Than The Universe, it should be no surprise that the difficulties Shirase Kobuchizawa had to overcome are likewise different, compared to other entries on this list. After her mother goes missing, she continues to hope for her survival, sending her emails every day and working hard to achieve her goal of traveling to Antarctica herself. To this end, she endures constant mocking from her peers and works hard to save up one million yen, taking various different part-time jobs while still in school. Shirase may not have faced ruthless enemies or physical abuse, but her resilience is impressive all the same.





 3  Homura Akemi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica) 
        

Homura Akemi, who is set to return in a new Puella Magi Madoka Magica movie, is one of the anime medium&#39;s most tragic characters. After suffering from heart disease for most of her childhood, she is transferred to a new middle school, where she has trouble connecting with people due to her shy and timid nature. This is where Madoka comes in, making friends with her and protecting her. Unfortunately, Madoka ends up dying before her, which prompts her to make a wish. Gaining the ability to travel back in time, she goes through dozens if not hundreds of time loops trying to save Madoka, as she once saved her.





 2  Naruto Uzumaki (Naruto) 
        

As Naruto&#39;s eponymous protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki&#39;s journey is endlessly inspiring and full of moments that prove his resilience. Because of the beast sealed within him, the Nine-Tailed Fox Kurama, Naruto was always shunned by most of his village throughout his childhood, often being mocked or simply ignored by his peers. However, this never stopped him from chasing his dream of becoming the Hokage, in spite of all the difficulties he faced on the way. From impossibly powerful foes to harsh training, near-death experiences, and even betrayal, Naruto had to overcome various obstacles on the way, but he eventually achieved his goal of becoming Konohagakure&#39;s leader, forcing everyone who doubted him to finally acknowledge him.





 1  Guts (Berserk) 
        

Berserk&#39;s tale is an infamously dark and disturbing one, with its protagonist being the subject of countless horrors and trials, that begin from his very birth. Initially left to die, Guts is eventually found and taken in by a group of mercenaries. However, he ends up being a victim of verbal and physical abuse, at the hands of the closest thing he has to a father figure. Later on, he joins the Band of the Hawk, where he meets his lover and a presumed friend, only to be betrayed yet again and lose everything he holds dear. In defiance of the horror he witnesses during the Eclipse, Guts decides to fight against the supernatural Apostoles and endure incredible hardships in the feeble hope of reaching a land where Caska can be finally at peace. As far as fiction goes, Guts may just be the personification of resilience and perseverance.
Some of these characters lived depressing lives, full of abuse and trauma. Others had to see the ones they cared for die, sometimes even repeatedly. However, the one thing they all have in common is that they never allow these moments to define them. Instead of giving up on the world and themselves, which would be fully understandable given their experiences, they only became stronger and more determined to survive and achieve their goals. This is why the most resilient anime characters are also the most inspiring ones.
