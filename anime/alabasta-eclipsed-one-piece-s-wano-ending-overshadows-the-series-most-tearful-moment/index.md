## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s most emotional arc ending has been surpassed by the new Shogun of Wano&#39;s touching declaration, which was more earned than Vivi&#39;s.





Summary

  The ending of the Wano arc in One Piece was even more emotional than Vivi&#39;s sendoff in Alabasta, as it saw the defeat of two Pirate Emperors and the liberation of the land&#39;s citizens from brutal conditions.   The people of Wano endured more hardship than the citizens of Alabasta, as they were made into slaves, subjected to starvation, and had their emotions stripped away by defective Devil Fruits.   The conclusion of the Alabasta arc laid the groundwork for the emotional impact of the Wano arc, as it featured a compelling villain, a heartwarming sacrifice by a friend, and Vivi&#39;s touching decision to stay behind and help rebuild her country.  







The One Piece anime&#39;s ending of Wano managed to be even more emotional than Vivi&#39;s Alabasta sendoff. Wano saw Pirate Emperors Big Mom and Kaido vanquished. The land&#39;s citizens no longer needed to live under the brutal conditions they&#39;d been subjugated to for decades. Luffy and his allies have previously saved kingdoms, but even the tearful goodbye to Alabasta&#39;s Princess doesn&#39;t compare to the emotions felt after Wano was reclaimed.

There have been more than a few heavily emotional arcs throughout One Piece&#39;s story. One of the most moving scenes that sticks in many fans&#39; minds is Vivi&#39;s decision not to leave Alabasta after Crocodile&#39;s defeat. At that point, Vivi had been a prevalent member of the crew throughout several of the anime&#39;s early arcs. The drama of that decision, the Marine&#39;s pursuit, and the recently quelled Civil War helped make the end of the Alabasta arc incredibly moving for many viewers. However, author Eiichiro Oda has made that ending feel like it was on training wheels compared to the emotions that came after Kaido&#39;s defeat in the latest anime arc.




                  One Piece&#39;s 25 Best Arcs, Ranked   One Piece is one of the most iconic, beloved, and long-running anime and manga ever. In all of its history, what are the best arcs in the story?   


 The People of Wano Endured More Hardship Than Alabasta&#39;s 

 

Many plot threads built up for years across several arcs finally paid off in episode #1078 of One Piece. Characters like Momonosuke and Kin&#39;emon were introduced as far back as the Punk Hazard arc, which aired in 2013. Since then, Luffy and his crew made significant enemies of two of the world&#39;s most powerful pirates, Big Mom and Kaido. As the Straw Hat Crew closed in on Kaido&#39;s base of operations on Wano, the once beautiful home of the samurai seemed a lot different from how Luffy&#39;s companions remembered it. For over 20 years, Wano&#39;s lands had been stripped and poisoned while its citizens endured one of One Piece&#39;s most disturbing fates.




One of One Piece&#39;s least likable characters, Kurozumi Orochi, worked to transform Wano into a weapons factory for Kaido&#39;s Beast Pirates. Citizens were made into slaves, starvation was rampant, and Orochi found a way to make things even worse for the hungry people of Wano. Kaido&#39;s defective artificial Devil Fruits were fed to the starving citizens, which permanently harmed their brains, causing them only to be able to express joy. The cruel tactic stripped the people of all of their emotions even while their family members were murdered in front of them. Alabasta&#39;s citizens did not have to endure such atrocities for 20 years.


 

While the anime has yet to have the Straw Hats leave Wano, episode #1078 beautifully concluded a horrific journey for the citizens of Wano with a triumphant and well-earned declaration. Momonosuke, the rightful Shogun of Wano who was thought long dead, appeared before his people to reveal that both Kaido and Orochi had been defeated. The touching speech ensured that after 20 years of suffering, the citizens would now be able to eat, drink, and live as they pleased, once again under a ruler who loves their country and its people.






 Alabasta&#39;s Ending Walked So Wano&#39;s Could Run 
          

The conclusion of the Alabasta arc is a fan-favorite for many good reasons. After becoming entangled with Vivi, Luffy and his crew were on a crash course with the notorious criminal syndicate Baroque Works and its cunning leader, the Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile. The villain manipulated the country&#39;s citizens with unnatural droughts and stroked tensions to cause a Civil War, all in his mission to find one of One Piece&#39;s ancient weapons that ended up being on Wano instead. Because Crocodile was such a compelling villain, finally watching Luffy take him down was rewarding in itself. Still, the arc&#39;s ending is highly regarded for more than its final battle.

After saving Alabasta, the Marines granted the Straw Hats higher bounties, prompting the crew to flee the country before being captured. Thankfully, the Straw Hats were able to make it to their ship, which was being protected by the shape-shifting Baroque Works agent Bon Clay. He was willing to help because Luffy&#39;s crew had formed a strong friendship with him before finding out he worked for Crocodile. He felt the bond was so strong that he sacrificed his freedom to distract the Marines for the crew despite only being friends with them briefly. While that gesture was moving, it merely warmed up viewers&#39; tear ducts for Vivi&#39;s moment.




Princess Vivi was given the choice to continue traveling with the Straw Hats, but it was a difficult decision between that and helping rebuild the country she worked so hard to save. She ultimately decided to stay behind, but her touching speech expressed her overwhelming gratitude and hope that, despite her decision, she was still regarded as a friend of the crew. Under the eye of the approaching Marines, the Straw Hats could not risk proving their connection to Alabasta&#39;s Princess. So they each brandished the Xs on their arms toward Vivi as the audience heard Luffy&#39;s words, &#34;No matter what happens, this thing on our left arm is the sign of our friendship!&#34;


 



 One Piece Viewers Were More Invested in Wano&#39;s Conclusion 
          




There is little debate that Vivi was a more likable character than Momonosuke, which helped Alabasta&#39;s ending hit its emotional high. Still, Momo&#39;s journey to eventually become the Shogun of Wano was more traumatic for him and his people. After learning about the betrayals, Oden&#39;s life, and the story of Kin&#39;emon and each of the Nine Red Scabbards, the desire to see Orochi dead and Wano free mounted to high levels that Alabasta did not.

Since Wano was the longest arc, there was a lot of time devoted to showcasing the brutal hardships and cruelty its people endured, so when Momonosuke presented himself as the new Shogun that would usher the land into a new dawn, tears erupted from both his people and One Piece viewers. While both endings were fantastic and tear-jerking, Oda has improved his writing skills over One Piece&#39;s 24 years of publication to make Wano&#39;s plight as miserable as possible, so when its happy ending did come, it felt much more impactful. Time will tell if One Piece will be able to deliver an ending even more impactful than Wano&#39;s in its final saga.
