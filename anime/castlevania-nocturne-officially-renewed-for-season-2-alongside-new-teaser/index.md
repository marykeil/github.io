## Literature Review

Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 gets an official confirmation and teaser trailer from Netflix after the first season&#39;s success with fans and critics.




Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 is officially confirmed to be in development at Netflix in an exciting new teaser trailer. The followup series to Netflix&#39;s original Castlevania animated series has already been marked as a wild success among fans and critics, with Nocturne already entering Netflix&#39;s top 10 in its first five days. Luckily fans thirsty for more can whet their appetite with a small teaser trailer for Castlevania: Nocturne season 2.




In a press release, Netflix released a teaser trailer for Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. The teaser shows what appears to be storyboards for the second season. Though the teaser does show the first season&#39;s main characters like Richter, Maria, and Annette, the biggest takeaway from the teaser is the new focus on Alucard. No further information such as a release date was revealed in the trailer, so it&#39;s unclear just how long fans will have to wait for Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. Regardless of the wait though, it&#39;s clear passion for the project is there as showrunners Clive Bradley and Kevin Kolde said:


“Thanks to all of the Castlevania fans old and new for the amazing response and support! We are excited to be able to bring you more Castlevania: Nocturne and the next chapter in the rise of Richter Belmont.”



 Castlevania: Nocturne Season 2 Puts Alucard in the Spotlight 

 




Season 1 of Castlevania: Nocturne was always poised to be a big moment for the animated adaptation of Konami&#39;s beloved videogame series. Nocturne is a loose adaptation of the fan-favorite Castlevania era that moved the series forward with games like Rondo of Blood (remade as Dracula X in the West) and Symphony of the Night. Though season 1 of Nocturne used Rondo as the rough basis for its characters and plot, the series diverged from the original in many ways. Notably the first season of Castlevania: Nocturne ended with the appearance of Alucard with a design quite reminiscent of his iconic look from Symphony of the Night.

If the teaser trailer is anything to go by, fans can definitely expect a lot more from Alucard. It&#39;s unclear how much Nocturne will take from Rondo or Symphony, though adapting the latter might be a more complicated task than initial appearances suggest. While Dracula is the main antagonist of almost every Castlevania game, his relationship to Alucard important to the plot of Symphony of the Night. However, Dracula is a much different character in Netflix&#39;s Castlevania than he is in the video game series. While the 300-year time skip between Castlevania and Nocturne could readily explain a sudden shift, it might undermine his development in the first series.




Regardless of how or if Nocturne adapts Symphony though, the team behind the animated adaptation is undoubtedly talented and has only ever made positive changes to the source material, so fans can rest assured Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 will be quality no matter what it adapts or changes. While details on the second season are scarce, Nocturne&#39;s success and swift renewal will no doubt be a major relief for fans of Richter, Maria, Anette, and Alucard. Castlevania: Nocturne season 2&#39;s confirmation certainly speaks to how hungry fans are for more of the beloved series.
