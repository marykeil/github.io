## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #14 will resolve the cliffhanger of the previous episode and also likely feature other fights occurring in Shibuya.




After a major cliffhanger ending in episode #13 fans are eagerly waiting for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #14. Given the high quality of episode #13, which featured one of the race&#39;s most anticipated fights, episode #14 could be disappointing in comparison. However, depending on how it deals with the major twist at the end of the previous episode, episode #14 could also have the potential to surpass it.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode #14 Releases 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #14 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, October 26. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 26 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #13? 
          

Episode #13 was almost entirely devoted to the fight between Yuji and Choso. This fight was easily one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s best, with Yuji initially being overwhelmed by Choso&#39;s blood manipulation techniques until he transitioned the fight into a bathroom. There he broke enough pipes to spray the room with water, which caused Choso&#39;s external blood to dissolve and turned the battle into a much more physical melee. Unfortunately for Yuji, Choso was still able to prevail but couldn&#39;t strike the killing blow after seeing false memories of Yuji as his brother. Then in a post-credits scene, Nanako and Mimiko find Yuji&#39;s body, which they seem to have a plan to use.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #14 Will Deal With Yuji 
          

The fact that this episode featured a post-credits scene related to Yuji&#39;s unconscious and grievously injured body implies that the next episode will follow up on that plot thread instead of leaving it for a later episode. Given his body is also shared by Sukuna and the King of Curses had a brief cameo during episode #13&#39;s fight, this could potentially have major ramifications for the rest of the arc. Once Nanako and Mimiko&#39;s plan is revealed, however, the episode will probably jump to some of the other fights in the arc such as Mei Mei&#39;s clash with the Smallpox curse. It may even start some new fights given there are some major characters like Nanami and the recently brought back Toji who are in Shibuya but currently not fighting anyone.




If the other fights that episode #14 features have the same level of animation as episode #13 they may also go down as some of the series’ best. Even if they aren’t the ramifications of what happens with Yuji next episode will likely be incredibly important to the remainder of the arc, making episode #14 potentially a watershed for the series. This makes Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #14 something that fans of the series won’t want to miss!

Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #14 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 19, 2023.
