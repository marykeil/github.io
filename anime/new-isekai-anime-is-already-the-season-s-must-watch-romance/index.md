## Literature Review

Tales of Wedding Rings might be an isekai â€“ but romance is one of the key drivers of this new series with formulated and even innovated tropes.




Warning: Spoilers for Tales of Wedding Rings episode #1




Fans who want a traditional isekai with a more prominent focus on romance as opposed to action and adventure as is the norm are in luck with the debut episode of the new Crunchyroll series Tales of Wedding Rings. Some of the best isekai feature a great deal of romantic encounters, like Sword Art Online, but what already sets Tales of Wedding Rings apart is that the entire premise is driven primarily by the relationship between the main characters Sato and Hime instead of it becoming a major theme later on.

Adapted from the original manga by Maybe, Tales of Wedding Rings features many of the most ubiquitous romance tropes within the first episode. For example, there&#39;s a protagonist who&#39;s tormented by his inability to tell his love interest how he feels as he anguishes over whether she returns his feelings.

          




The first episode even features the stereotypical date at a festival where the girl wears a stunning yukata. And, of course, it culminates in a romantic fireworks display. However, this is where the stereotypes end and the series takes an original direction.


 Tales of Wedding Rings Is A Conventional Romance But Still Innovates 
Produced by Square Enix and based on the manga by Maybe
          

While conventional in these regards, what will undoubtedly catch romance-goers off guard is that Sato and Hime actually kiss not once, but twice during the debut episode. This is unprecedented on many levels. Although this has the potential of ruining the build-up that most romance anime benefit from, Tales of Wedding Rings is still remarkably able to leave enough room for doubt among both characters, maintaining some semblance of the much-needed suspense and anticipation that most romance anime thrive under.




As a result, Tales of Wedding Rings is able to uncharacteristically comply with and innovate celebrated romance tropes within an isekai setting. The only caveat is that Tales of Wedding Rings is marked as &#34;mature&#34; due to some classic fan-service scenes, so it&#39;s very likely that the series might get unnecessarily more graphic, but only time will tell. Similar to how romance drives Tales of Wedding Rings&#39;s plot despite being an isekai, the incorporation of this genre coincidentally lays the foundation of the romantic elements in its first episode. Sato and Hime are automatically star-crossed lovers, since they are literally from different worlds.

          

Even though extenuating circumstances eventually bring these star-crossed lovers closer together than most characters, the series is already creating the impression that Sato being from another world will likely cause some complications down the road. Regardless, what fans of Tales of Wedding Rings are excited about is not necessarily the battle that Sato is about to embark on with his enhanced battleaxe, but what awaits him and his wife in his new isekai home.
