## Literature Review

With so much good manga available, it&#39;s easy to skip some gems. However, one excellent title similar to Blue Lock is doing its best to get noticed.




While Blue Lock might be the best-selling manga of the past year, Young Jump&#39;s The Days of Diamond has thrown down the gauntlet to challenge it as the best sports manga of the year. This underrated sports series isn&#39;t just great, it&#39;s one of the year&#39;s most underrated shonen manga.




Hirai Oohashi&#39;s The Days of Diamond follows middle school student Jiro Ayasegawa who wants to find a place to fit in. The problem is that he&#39;s a natural athletic talent. When he puts his mind to it, there&#39;s no sport he can&#39;t master. Unfortunately, his abilities intimidate others to the point that they&#39;d rather quit than compete with him. Most importantly, the jealousy and hate that his abilities generate in others make it almost impossible to make friends.

          

Life changes for the better, however, after he joins a local little league baseball team whose motto is just to have fun. With no pressure to win games, Jiro&#39;s teammates don&#39;t care if he&#39;s better than them. Happy to have found his place to fit in and make friends, Jiro feels less pressure to hold back his talents. As a result, he blossoms into an awesome baseball talent. Soon, the National youth team comes looking, and once again Jiro is thrust into the ultra-competitive sports situation he hates. But something strange happened this time - he&#39;s not the only one on the team who is talented.





 The Days Of Diamond Is A Manga Best-Seller In The Making 
          

When compared to the currently best-selling title, Kodansha&#39;s Blue Lock, The Days of Diamond has all the attributes to compete. According to This Manga is Amazing!, The Days of Diamond was the most popular manga title of the year among Japanese male teens and young adults. As with Blue Lock the plot&#39;s focus is on the players. The Days of Diamond goes further down this path in that readers already knows Jiro is good. The issue is how the personal and team-oriented pressures of being so talented affect him and those around him. It&#39;s a microcosm of contemporary youth sports where talented kids at increasingly younger ages need to navigate a world where they and everyone around them have an interest in their success.

Notwithstanding Jiro himself, there are also plenty of memorable characters. There&#39;s his mother - the always supportive guardian who unwittingly gives Jiro additional pressure by wanting to put her son in the best position to succeed. There&#39;s also his teammate Tougou, who, as his catcher, is the first person he&#39;s met who can catch his pitches and - more importantly - is not intimidated by his talent. Finally, there&#39;s the art. While baseball, by its nature, is not a very &#34;action-oriented&#34; game like soccer, Hirai makes those parts of it that have movement - the pitches, hits, catches, and base running - pop with a graphic electricity rarely seen in sports manga.






 The Days Of Diamond Is Already Popular in Japan 
          

One of the barriers to The Days of Diamond having a wider, more global popularity is that it hasn&#39;t been showcased in Shueisha&#39;s premier manga anthology Shonen Jump. Currently, it&#39;s being published in Shonen Jump&#39;s sister magazine Young Jump. While Young Jump is popular in Japan, it does not have much of an international footprint. Another impediment is that it currently does not have an anime adaptation. Anime adaptations help diversify a title&#39;s fan base, often bringing increased interest from viewers who want a deeper dive into the story than provided in the anime.

While Shueisha&#39;s stable of Jump magazines tends to emphasize titles that showcase action-packed, fight-centric stories, The Days of Diamond is one of its few sports-based manga series that can transcend its genre and find general acceptance. While it is currently not well-known outside of Japan, its popularity and its quality suggest that it&#39;s only a matter of time before Young Jump&#39;s The Days Of Diamond will be challenging Blue Lock and others for the best-selling title.
