## Literature Review

Netflix has officially debuted the opening credits for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, and the music and visuals makes it just as awesome as fans expected.




The opening for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off has officially premiered, and it&#39;s just as awesome as fans expected it to be. Netflix&#39;s upcoming adaptation of the hit graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley is undoubtedly the most anticipated anime for the remainder of 2023. Not only is it showcasing a faithful art style, but it&#39;s also reuniting the iconic cast from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World to reprise their roles.




Now with the premiere of the anime less than a month away, the opening credits have officially debuted on Netflix&#39;s YouTube channel, and it&#39;s absolutely perfect. It&#39;s a beautiful mix of punk art style, which mimics the opening credits of the 2010 film, and Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley&#39;s iconic character designs.


 

As it begins with a bass, Scott Pilgrim&#39;s instrument of choice, playing a solo riff before getting into Nercy Talkie&#39;s main theme called &#34;Bloom,&#34; it just feels like what fans would expect from an animated adaptation of the franchise. The use of color, 2000s-era music and expressive animation make this opening stand out as it gears up fans for the perfect adaptation of the hit graphic novel series.


 Scott Pilgrim&#39;s Cast Takes the Spotlight 
          




One of the most notable moments in the opening is a brief segment when Scott and Ramona hold hands while floating through subspace. The cast from the 2010 Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World film are highlighted in massive lettering, letting viewers make no mistake that every member of the film&#39;s cast returned for the new series. From Michael Cera to Ellen Wong, the series wears these performers like a badge of honor as they return to some of their most beloved roles to give the source material a proper adaptation. After all, the film was finished before O&#39;Malley&#39;s final chapter in the Scott Pilgrim saga was published, so giving fans the chance to see these stars, especially Mary-Elizabeth Winstead and Michael Cera, play out the comic&#39;s true ending is something that&#39;s worth celebrating in the show&#39;s opening.



 Ramona&#39;s Seven Evil Exes Are Scarier Than Ever 
          




Something else that really stands out about this opening is how the Evil Exes are portrayed. The way they&#39;re highlighted by shadows makes them a far bigger threat than they could ever be portrayed in live action. As it lists off the various people Scott will fight throughout the series, Gideon Graves alone is perfectly shown as an ominous force in the background pulling all the strings in an effort to control Ramona&#39;s love life. He&#39;s dark, sinister and could potentially be better here than he was in the film.

As for the others, it looks like fans will finally get to see more comic-accurate depictions of these Exes as they appear to take Scott on. The most notable of these first six though are the Katayanagi twins. They&#39;re actually shown with their robot that was a huge presence in the comics, hinting that the film&#39;s anticlimactic battle with them will finally explore their characters and the meaning the Katayanagi twins bring to Scott Pilgrim&#39;s story.

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is set to premiere on November 17th. Based on the early trailers, the advanced clips, and now the opening credits reveal, this will be a series that fans of the comic won&#39;t want to miss. The opening&#39;s tone captures the spirit of Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley&#39;s universe while giving enough for fans to look forward to as it hints toward a more faithful adaptation. There&#39;s nothing quite like Scott Pilgrim, and the fact that this anime has what made the comic and film work on full display makes it undoubtedly one of the year&#39;s best anime opening credits.
