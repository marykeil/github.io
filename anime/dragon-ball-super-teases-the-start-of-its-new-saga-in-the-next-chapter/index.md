Summary

  Dragon Ball Super fans can look forward to a new saga starting in chapter #100, after the Super Hero Arc ends, according to the editor of V-Jump magazine.   Fans have been eagerly awaiting an original storyline after the Super Hero movie adaptation, and they may finally get it with the upcoming developments in the manga.   The editor&#39;s tease of &#34;unbelievably unexpected&#34; events and &#34;crazy developments&#34; in chapter #100 will create immense hype among fans, making the wait for the new chapter feel even longer.  





Dragon Ball Super surprises fans by teasing that its much-anticipated new saga will start in the next chapter, right when the Super Hero Arc ends. The Dragon Ball Super manga is currently adapting the Super Hero movie, which left fans starving for a new original storyline for a while, and they could get it very soon.




In a recent video for the Bandai Spirits channel, the editor of the V-Jump magazine (where Dragon Ball Super is currently published) promoted the latest issue, which contains chapter #99 of Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou&#39;s manga. However, Uchida also left fans with a tease of what&#39;s to come.


 

As shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user @perperayume (Andy), Uchida said in the video that something &#34;unbelievably unexpected&#34; will happen in chapter #100, and that fans should look forward to the upcoming &#34;crazy developments&#34; in the series.

Victory Uchida&#39;s tease could not come a second too soon. The manga adaptation of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero added meaningful content to the movie version, but fans were nonetheless disappointed about not getting an original story. The previous arc of the manga ended in truly dramatic fashion, with the return of Frieza who debuted his incredibly powerful Black form, and made quick work of both Goku and Vegeta despite them using their Ultra transformations.

Fans who were hoping to see how the manga would follow up on that had to settle first for a Super Hero prequel focused on Goten and Trunks, and then for a faithful adaptation of the story they have already seen in theaters or streaming online. Meanwhile, Goku and Vegeta have been training on Beerus&#39; planet, while Frieza simply disappeared. Fans hoped that this story would continue after the Super Hero Arc, which will conclude in chapter #100, but there was no guarantee this would happen, as the manga could simply go on hiatus instead. There is also no guarantee that the story will pick up where the Granolah the Survivor Arc ended.




          

Of course, chapter #100 marks a milestone for the series, and it&#39;s understandable that the authors want to capitalize on it by making it as memorable as possible. Victory Uchida&#39;s words are not just teasing the start of a new story arc, but major developments that fans could not anticipate, so the hype for the new chapter is bound to reach unprecedented heights. There is only one month to go before chapter #100 of Dragon Ball Super, but it will surely seem a lot longer for fans.
