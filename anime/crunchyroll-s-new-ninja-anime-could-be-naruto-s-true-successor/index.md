## Literature Review

Crunchyroll’s new anime Under Ninja explores a long-ignored element of ninja life, and in doing so, shows its potential to be a game-changing anime,





Under Ninja, which is adapted from the Kengo Hanazawa manga of the same name, tells the story of the modern-day ninja. In the contemporary world, ninjas are still present, but they are no longer delegated – at least officially – in hidden villages. Instead, they&#39;ve been co-opted by the official government as a secret military force and integrated into the general population.




          

However, ninja society does remain socially isolated. While they could be a teacher, doctor, or food delivery person, they maintain a permanent and inescapable role in ninja society that runs parallel to their role in the &#34;open&#34; society.


 Ninjas Are Everywhere In Modern Japan 
          

The anime follows Kuro Kumogakure, a seventeen-year-old Genin ninja who is one of the 200,000 shinobi currently present in Japan. However, while he possesses the classic set of ninja abilities, Kuro lacks a ninja job to put those abilities to use. In fact, unlike the thousands of other unassigned ninjas, Kuro doesn&#39;t even have a &#34;cover&#34; job in the general community. He spends his days using his ninja skills to steal beers and food from his neighbors, and playing pranks on others. This all changes when he receives an assignment from his handler to infiltrate a local high school. Finally, with a real ninja job in his hands, Kuro decides to give it his best shot. The problem is, he&#39;s been slacking for so long, it&#39;s not as easy channeling his ninja side as he thought.




Under Ninja&#39;s focus on the back-end aspects of being a ninja makes it the perfect successor to the most famous ninja anime of all time – Naruto. On the one hand, Naruto proved that any ninja – even the underdogs – can rise above the circumstances of his life to become one of the greatest ninjas of his generation. However, it was a fantasy anime at its core, with little concern for realism. Conversely, Under Ninja shows that ninjas can be an important part of the modern world, ridden with conflict and warfare as it is. However, they live hidden in plain sight, making the setting and tone of the story a lot more realistic.



 Under Ninja Presents The Aspects Of Ninja Life That Naruto Skips 
          

If Under Ninja followed the typical ninja anime model, the episodes would be a lot more action-ridden. However, the genius of Under Ninja is that it details the non-action-facing aspects of the mission, such as how Kuro overcomes the obstacle of registering for a school without a grade report and without parents or a guardian. These more realistic aspects of the ninja lifestyle are ignored in Naruto. This isn&#39;t to say that Under Ninja is all about ninja minutiae. Showing the more mundane aspects of the lifestyle is actually interesting when packaged with a compelling story. Under Ninja provides a more holistic, interesting, and updated view of a ninja&#39;s life than Naruto ever did, making it potentially one of Crunchyroll&#39;s next big hits.




Under Ninja is streaming new episodes every Thursday on Crunchyroll.
