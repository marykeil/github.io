<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Throughout the series, Ash Ketchum is joined by many friends who accompany him across the region as they work towards their own goals.</p>
<p>Pokémon is an iconic anime series that has introduced equally iconic characters to the world. As the protagonist, Ash Ketchum travels throughout the different regions, he is joined by many characters who support him on his journey. While some companions only join him for a short time, others remain for multiple seasons of the anime.
The concept of Pokémon first originated in 1996 as a pair of role-playing games for the Game Boy but quickly expanded to include manga, trading cards, and anime, since becoming a fixture of popular culture. The anime&rsquo;sstory follows a boy named Ash Ketchum as he encounters many friends and foes on his quest to become a Pokémon Master.</p>
<p>With the series ending after more than two decades, it&rsquo;s often nostalgic to remember Ash&rsquo;s most memorable companions.</p>
<p>10  Goh Has a Good Relationship With Ash Despite His Flaws
Pokémon Journeys: The Series</p>
<p>Goh is the last companion from the main series and is considered a controversial character by many fans. Part of this stems from the way he is depicted as a prodigy, who, despite his lack of training, is seen as being superior to Ash despite the latter being more experienced as a trainer. Regardless of Goh&rsquo;s character, however, he has a good friendship with Ash, and they share many similarities that bring them closer. He admires his friend and learns from him on several occasions, but the story quickly sets him up as a deuteragonist whose adventures exist separately from Ash. This is different from other companions who, despite having their own goals, are seen more as supporting characters.</p>
<p>9  Lana Has a Calm Energy That Compliments Ash
Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon</p>
<p>Lana first meets Ash while riding a Lapras, and fishes him out of the water. The two soon become classmates at the Pokémon School when they take Professor Kukui&rsquo;s class on Alolan Pokémon. As a water Pokémon trainer, Lana is often seen doing water-based activities and spending time with her partner Popplio. Although calm most of the time, she will lose her cool when she sees Pokémon being mistreated. She has a good relationship with Ash, showing great respect for him and cheering him on during his battles, while he does the same for her. However, the two friends occasionally show irritation towards each other.</p>
<p>8  Lillie Learns To Overcome Her Fear With Ash&rsquo;s Help
Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon</p>
<p>Lillie is another one of Ash&rsquo;s classmates from the Pokémon School. She is terrified of Pokémon due to a traumatic attack from her childhood, but still works towards her dream of becoming a researcher. After adopting an Alolan Vulpix, Lillie starts to overcome her fear with the support of her classmates. While much of her story revolves around her relationship with her mother, she has plenty of great moments with her friends. Lillie develops a close friendship with Ash, taking inspiration from him and admiring his love for Pokémon. She also uses her knowledge to help him and reassure him when he&rsquo;s down. Their bond is shown during Lillie&rsquo;s departure when she gives Ash a heartfelt goodbye.</p>
<p>All of Ash&rsquo;s Companions, Ranked By Number of Pokémon Caught
Ash may not have caught them all, but how did his friends fare over the course of the series? Here&rsquo;s each of Ash&rsquo;s traveling companions, ranked.</p>
<p>7  Kiawe Is Both a Rival And Friend For Ash
Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon</p>
<p>Kiawe is a fire Pokémon trainer who attends school with the rest of his friends, while also making deliveries for his family&rsquo;s farm. He first meets Ash when the two battle against Team Skull, becoming impressed with the other boy&rsquo;s efforts. As the series progresses, the two develop both a rivalry and a friendship, often training together and having heart-to-heart conversations. As the most experienced trainer among his classmates, Kiawe appears calm and confident in his abilities but is actually an emotional person who frequently serves as comic relief. Despite this, however, he sometimes shows a serious side when he acts as a supportive older brother figure for Ash.</p>
<p>6  Clemont And Ash Say Goodbye With a Battle
Pokemon the Series: XY</p>
<p>Despite being the fourth companion who is a Gym Leader, Clemont has quirks that make him just as memorable as the rest. Specializing in electric-type Pokémon, he is a brilliant inventor forced out of his gym by one of his inventions, a robot he calls Clembot. He and his sister, Bonnie, find Ash thrown out of Lumiose City Gym, and later decide to join him on his travels across Kalos. Clemont has great admiration for Ash, who in turn has a deep respect for his friend. The two are shown as equals who are constantly learning from each other and helping each other grow. They finish their time together with a symbolic battle, ending their journey exactly the way it started.</p>
<p>5  Serena Is Ash&rsquo;s Childhood Friend Who Reunites With Him
Pokémon the series: XY</p>
<p>While she&rsquo;s often known for her implicit romance with Ash, Serena is an excellent character in her own right. She first meets him as a child and is immediately inspired by his positive attitude. After joining the group, she frequently supports Ash in his endeavors and tries her best to lift his spirits when he&rsquo;s upset. He returns these sentiments and even delays one of his gym battles so that she can participate in a contest. However, Serena&rsquo;s infatuation and occasional self-doubt sometimes cause her to put Ash on a pedestal, making their relationship somewhat one-sided. Despite this, the two share a close friendship that allows Serena to truly develop as a character.</p>
<p>4  May Is the First Companion To See Ash As a Mentor
Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire</p>
<p>With her sunny disposition and love for cute Pokémon, May is one of the most lovable characters in the series. She&rsquo;s also the first companion to see Ash as a mentor figure who helps her overcome her dislike for Pokémon. She first meets him after Pikachu destroys her bike, but instead of getting angry, she asks to travel with them so that she can learn about becoming a Pokémon trainer. As the story progresses, May realizes her dream of competing in contests and, while she still looks up to him, becomes more of an equal to Ash. The two of them develop mutual support and admiration for each other, growing from their shared experiences.</p>
<p>3  Dawn &amp; Ash Are Like Two Peas In a Pod
Pokémon the Series: Diamond &amp;Pearl</p>
<p>Dawn&rsquo;s relationship with Ash greatly resembles that of siblings. She meets Ash similarly to his other female companions, once again having her bike fried by Pikachu, and joining him on his travels after. However, she stands on her own as a charming character who is just as stubborn and passionate as Ash. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for the two to bond, even sharing frequent high-fives as a sign of their friendship. Ash and Dawn often rely on each other for advice, especially for contests and battles, and constantly encourage each other to grow. During the Master&rsquo;s Eight Tournament, Dawn is also the only companion to cheer on Ash during his battle.</p>
<p>Pokémon: Every League Championship Ash Participated In (&amp; Where He Placed)
Ash competes in plenty of League Championships throughout his time in the Pokémon anime and even wins some of them, thanks to his skill as a Trainer.</p>
<p>2  Misty Is Ash&rsquo;s First Companion And Friend
Original series &amp; onward</p>
<p>As the first-ever companion to join Ash, Misty holds a special place in many fans&rsquo; hearts. She is the prototype for the running gag of Ash destroying bikes and initially follows him so he can pay her back. However, they develop a strong friendship over time, with Misty often acting as a foil to Ash and mentoring him as a Pokémon trainer. The two are shown to deeply care for each other and share a strong level of trust. Their constant bickering is also hilarious and has since become a trademark of their time together. Overall, they continue to maintain a strong friendship after parting ways, with Misty sending her fishing lure to Ash, who treasures his gift.</p>
<p>1  Brock Cares About Ash Like An Older Brother
Original series &amp; onward</p>
<p>Brock is the longest-running companion, to the point where he is basically family to Ash. He meets the younger trainer when they battle at the Pewter Gym and later shares many adventures with him while developing an everlasting friendship. Throughout the series, Brock takes care of Ash and his other friends, ensuring their safety and acting like an older brother to them. He also serves as a mentor for Ash, showing endless faith and support in him. This feeling is mutual from Ash&rsquo;s end, and he deeply respects and looks up to Brock. Their emotional goodbye in Diamond &amp; Pearl signifies the end of an era for Pokémon, easily cementing Brock as the best companion from the series.
