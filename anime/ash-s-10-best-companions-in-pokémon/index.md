## Literature Review

Throughout the series, Ash Ketchum is joined by many friends who accompany him across the region as they work towards their own goals.




Pokémon is an iconic anime series that has introduced equally iconic characters to the world. As the protagonist, Ash Ketchum travels throughout the different regions, he is joined by many characters who support him on his journey. While some companions only join him for a short time, others remain for multiple seasons of the anime.
The concept of Pokémon first originated in 1996 as a pair of role-playing games for the Game Boy but quickly expanded to include manga, trading cards, and anime, since becoming a fixture of popular culture. The anime&#39;sstory follows a boy named Ash Ketchum as he encounters many friends and foes on his quest to become a Pokémon Master.
        

With the series ending after more than two decades, it&#39;s often nostalgic to remember Ash&#39;s most memorable companions.









 








 10  Goh Has a Good Relationship With Ash Despite His Flaws 
Pokémon Journeys: The Series
        

Goh is the last companion from the main series and is considered a controversial character by many fans. Part of this stems from the way he is depicted as a prodigy, who, despite his lack of training, is seen as being superior to Ash despite the latter being more experienced as a trainer. Regardless of Goh&#39;s character, however, he has a good friendship with Ash, and they share many similarities that bring them closer. He admires his friend and learns from him on several occasions, but the story quickly sets him up as a deuteragonist whose adventures exist separately from Ash. This is different from other companions who, despite having their own goals, are seen more as supporting characters.





 9  Lana Has a Calm Energy That Compliments Ash 
Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon
        

Lana first meets Ash while riding a Lapras, and fishes him out of the water. The two soon become classmates at the Pokémon School when they take Professor Kukui&#39;s class on Alolan Pokémon. As a water Pokémon trainer, Lana is often seen doing water-based activities and spending time with her partner Popplio. Although calm most of the time, she will lose her cool when she sees Pokémon being mistreated. She has a good relationship with Ash, showing great respect for him and cheering him on during his battles, while he does the same for her. However, the two friends occasionally show irritation towards each other.





 8  Lillie Learns To Overcome Her Fear With Ash&#39;s Help 
Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon

She is terrified of Pokémon due to a traumatic attack from her childhood, but still works towards her dream of becoming a researcher. After adopting an Alolan Vulpix, Lillie starts to overcome her fear with the support of her classmates. While much of her story revolves around her relationship with her mother, she has plenty of great moments with her friends. Lillie develops a close friendship with Ash, taking inspiration from him and admiring his love for Pokémon. She also uses her knowledge to help him and reassure him when he&#39;s down.

After joining the group, she frequently supports Ash in his endeavors and tries her best to lift his spirits when he&#39;s upset. He returns these sentiments and even delays one of his gym battles so that she can participate in a contest. However, Serena&#39;s infatuation and occasional self-doubt sometimes cause her to put Ash on a pedestal, making their relationship somewhat one-sided.
