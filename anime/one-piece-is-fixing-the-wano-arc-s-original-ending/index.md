## Literature Review

The ending to the Wano Arc was criticized for skipping over a wide variety of plot points, but the One Piece anime is primed to fix that.




Warning: Potential SPOILERS for episode #1084 of One PieceThe One Piece anime will soon finish adapting the Wano Arc, and it’s set to do so in a way that fixes the original ending. One common criticism of the Wano Arc is the rushed nature of its ending; despite being the longest arc, it left many plot points left unresolved, including some relevant ones concerning Zoro and his family heritage.




Fortunately, it appears that the One Piece anime’s version of the Wano Arc will fix some of the problems with the manga’s ending. Despite there only being one chapter of the Wano Arc left for the anime to adapt, One Piece episode #1084, “Time to Depart - The Land of Wano and the Straw Hats”, will instead expand on the Straw Hat Pirates’ final days in Wano.

          

Based on the preview, said episode will be used to cover material that the manga was criticized for skipping over, and while that won’t fix all the problems with the ending, it will still improve things, nonetheless.

 One Piece Episode #1084&#39;s Preview Hints At Big Changes For Wano&#39;s Ending 

 

The preview for One Piece episode #1084 suggests that the end of the Wano Arc is going to be expanded on, and there are certainly a few plot points for it to cover. For starters, Carrot disappeared from the manga after being appointed the new ruler of the Mokomo Dukedom, so episode #1084 can be used to let her properly part ways with the Straw Hats. Another point that needs to be addressed is Zoro visiting Ryuma’s grave, something he said he wanted to do, but never did, and that, in turn, would also be a good chance to delve into Zoro&#39;s Shimotsuki lineage, something the manga alluded to, but only ever discussed in an SBS.

If there’s anything that One Piece episode #1084 needs to cover, however, it’s giving Luffy and Tama a proper farewell. Tama was supposed to be the emotional centerpiece of the Wano arc and Luffy’s primary motivation for fighting Kaido, but the lack of interactions between the two of them in the later stages of the arc, including a lack of a proper farewell between them, greatly detracted from that and made Tama come across as less relevant. The preview for episode #1084, however, suggests that the primary focus will be on Luffy and Tama’s relationship, so it’s a perfect chance to finally give Tama a proper sendoff.






 One Piece Can’t Fix Everything About Wano’s Ending 
Yamato&#39;s Exit From The Story Will Still Be Disappointing
          

One Piece episode #1084 can certainly fix a lot about the Wano arc’s ending, but there are some points that it, unfortunately, can’t do anything about. As previously mentioned, one plot point that was skipped over in the manga was Marco talking to Luffy, which was only shown in a flashback in the Egghead arc, and since the story’s already passed the point when that chronologically happened, it’s unlikely that episode #1084 will cover it. Granted, they could change the point in time when Luffy and Marco talked, something that’s been done in the anime before, but that’s happened too infrequently for it to be a reasonable possibility now.

                  Retro Review: One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc Took The Series To Unprecedented Heights   From emotional flashbacks to shocking revelations and stunning action scenes, the Wano Arc is the pinnacle of One Piece&#39;s storytelling and animation.   




Another sticking point that can’t be alleviated is Yamato not joining the Straw Hat Pirates. Naturally, the anime can’t rewrite canon to have Yamato join the crew, and just like with Marco, the story has already passed the point in time when Yamato revealed the real reason why he was staying in Wano. Episode #1084 of One Piece can be considered the &#34;filler&#34; that the series needs to breathe a little before diving into the new arc, but there are still many things it can do to improve the overall story, thus making the Wano Arc’s ending even better than the manga.
