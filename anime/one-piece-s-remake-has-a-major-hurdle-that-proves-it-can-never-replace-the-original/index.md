## Literature Review

One inherent issue keeps the new One Piece remake from replacing the original and it could potentially alienate many loyal fans of the series.




One Piece&#39;s Netflix remake may be doomed to fail, and it all has to do with one major hurdle that could prevent it from ever replacing the original. The new One Piece remake aims to re-animate the East Blue Saga in an effort to draw in new fans who may be put off by the older style of animation but may end up alienating fans instead.




Admittedly, One Piece&#39;s animation and quality have come a long way since the series was first picked up by Toei Animation Studio twenty-five years ago, with newer episodes seeming nearly unrecognizable compared to earlier ones. Having said that, the old 90s-style animation of the earlier episodes of One Piece is highly nostalgic and holds a special place among many fans of the franchise who could understandably be put off by the remake.

          

Despite the remake having the best of intentions, this sentimentality attached to the original series and the older character designs could even end up being the reason the remake fails, possibly tarnishing the legacy of the franchise in the process.

                  One Piece Fans Have One Major Concern About Netflix&#39;s Anime Remake   The studio behind Netflix&#39;s new The One Piece anime has previously used AI, and some fans are worried the controversial tool will be used again.   





 One Piece&#39;s Original 90s Animation Holds Plenty of Nostalgia 
          

Though they may not be as crisp or flashy as the latest episodes, One Piece&#39;s older episodes have aged surprisingly well, becoming something fans can look back to with fondness, especially for those who grew up with the series and have religiously kept up with it over the last two decades. While many iconic moments from the East Blue Saga such as the walk to Arlong Park, Zoro&#39;s backstory with Kuina, and Luffy giving Nami his Straw Hat have been reanimated time and time again, these instances have been limited to select flashbacks, still preserving the memory of the original while helping fans reminisce.

Nostalgia is meant to be preserved and strategically evoked, but the One Piece remake could instead end up trampling on this nostalgia and the legacy of the series by devaluing the original and all the effort that went into its production, a concern also expressed by Film: Red director, Hiromi Ishigami.




                  First of its Kind - One Piece’s Anime Remake isn’t Just Surprising, it’s Unprecedented   One Piece makes history yet again by becoming the first ever anime series in history to receive a reboot while still airing.   



 The One Piece Reboot Cannot Fix the Pacing Without Ruining the Series 
          

Given that fans have just recently witnessed the events of the East Blue Saga through Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of One Piece, another adaptation of the same series of events may be all the more unnecessary. While some might argue the remake could fix One Piece&#39;s infamous issues with pacing, the East Blue Saga is one of One Piece&#39;s shortest sagas, even though it comes in at 61 whole episodes.

Though the live-action adaptation proves its story can be condensed into a much more compact form, it only manages to do so by sacrificing investment in minor characters and their backstories. This exploration of minor characters is not only one of the series&#39; defining traits but also what makes One Piece truly exceptional. One Piece is very much about the journey and as hard as the series may be to get into at the start, the East Blue Saga sets the tone for the rest of the series and the surprising extent of emotional investment fans can expect in the most insignificant characters.




          

Overall, while One Piece is far from flawless, its imperfections have been wholeheartedly embraced by many fans who may prefer the original regardless of how fantastic the remake may be. Despite its slow pacing and dated animation, the East Blue Saga is undoubtedly iconic, and the remake will surely never be able to replace the original for this very reason.

One Piece is available from Crunchyroll.
