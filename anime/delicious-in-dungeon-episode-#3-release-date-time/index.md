 What Happened In Delicious In Dungeon Episode 2? 
          

As the episode title would imply, Delicious in Dungeon episode #2, “Roast Basilisk/Omelet/Kakiage”, was split into three different segments. In the first segment, Laios’ party hunted a basilisk that had just wiped out a newbie party, and after roasting it, Senshi imparted onto the surviving members the importance of proper diet and exercise. In the second segment, Marcille nearly got herself killed using a giant bat to harvest mandrakes when everyone started making her feel useless, but Laios reassured her that he just wanted her to save her strength for the lower levels of the dungeon, and Marcille regained her confidence as they ate mandrake omelets.




In the final segment, which took up roughly half the episode, Chilchuck, whose role in the party is to detect traps, fights with Senshi over his lack of attention to the traps, made worse by Senshi deciding to use oil from a firetrap for their next meal. Senshi later put Chilchuck in charge of the mandrake and bat kakiage, a tempura dish made with small pieces of food, and Chilchuck’s struggles with it made him realize how hard Senshi’s job is. With that, Chilchuck and Senshi buried the hatchet and agreed to teach each other a little about the other person’s skills, thus bringing them closer as party members.
