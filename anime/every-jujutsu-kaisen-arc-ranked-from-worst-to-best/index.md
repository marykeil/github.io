## Literature Review

After being serialized for over 5 years Jujutsu Kaisen has a variety of arcs, all of which are great but some of which are better than others.




Warning! Contains major spoilers for the Jujutsu Kaisen manga!
Jujutsu Kaisen is currently one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most iconic battle manga, standing alongside the likes of My Hero Academia and One Piece. This is partially due to how long it has been serialized, spanning multiple intense arcs. Now that the manga is officially in its end game, it seems a perfect time to compare these storylines and see which Jujutsu Kaisen arcs are the best.
Of course, as fans know, no Jujutsu Kaisen arc is abjectly terrible. They all feed into the manga&#39;s overall narrative in interesting ways and often are filled with innovative fight scenes. Mangaka Gege Akutami is a master at constructing the plot of the series simultaneously on a micro and macro level, which leads these arcs to all be incredibly satisfying even if they may not measure up to the best moments the series has to offer. However, some storylines stand out as being a cut above the rest with the best of them being one of the best Shonen manga arcs ever. These are all of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s arcs ranked from worst to best.









 








 11  Itadori&#39;s Extermination Arc 
        

As the first storyline after the Shibuya Incident, the Itadori&#39;s Extermination arc had some big shoes to fill but largely can&#39;t maintain the same standard of quality as its predecessor. This isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s all bad. The aftermath of the Shibuya Incident is fascinating and tragic to witness and the reintroduction of Yuta is superb. But the lack of any major fights in this arc really holds it back.





 10  Death Painting Arc 
        

While the Death Painting arc has two great fights, that&#39;s pretty much all it has going for it. The arc does introduce the concept of Cursed Wombs, which would become important later on when Choso became more of a character, so it&#39;s far from filler. However, the brevity of the arc also works against it, making it one of the more forgettable storylines in the series. But forgettable isn&#39;t bad, with moments like Itadori and Nobara&#39;s dual black flash really standing out. It just doesn&#39;t compare to the later storylines the story would tackle.





 9  Fearsome Womb Arc 
        

This may be a controversial pick but the Fearsome Womb arc deserves it. Being the first arc of the main series the Fearsome Womb arc has a lot of exposition to do, and luckily it does it well, setting up the world of sorcery and curses quite nicely while also introducing the main characters of the series. It also fears the first fight between Gojo and Sukuna as well as Yuji&#39;s shocking &#34;death&#34;. However, like the Death Painting arc it is too short to make a lasting impact on the audience beyond hooking them on the story. Still as an opener goes, few series could do better.





 8  Culling Game Arc 
        

The Culling Game has been one of the most controversial arcs in Jujutsu Kaisen history. It features some of the highest highs the series has to offer like Sukuna possessing Megumi and the fight between Hakari and Kashimo, but it also drags. Focusing on each colony individually meant that certain characters weren&#39;t featured for a very long time and made many of the new characters and fights feel inconsequential. However, the arc may read better on a reread after the series is over as the Culling Game may have set up ideas that haven&#39;t actually paid off yet.





 7  Cursed Child Arc 
        

This arc is kind of a weird one given it isn&#39;t really part of the main series, instead serving as a prequel focused on Yuta Okkotsu. Its events are very important for the series as a whole featuring the culmination of Geto&#39;s plans and his death at the hands of Gojo. It also shows a variety of characters before their introduction in the main series like Gojo, Maki, Panda, and Inumaki. Its greatest strength however is telling one relatively self-contained story about Yuta&#39;s growth as a character, which makes it more fulfilling than some of the other arcs on this list.





 6  Gojo&#39;s Past Arc 
        

The Gojo&#39;s Past arc is another arc taking place before the events of the main series, except this time the chapters were released as part of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s regular serialization. It follows Gojo and Geto&#39;s high school years as they take on a mission to protect a young girl before she gets assimilated by the immortal sorcerer Tengen. Unfortunately their mission fails due to the actions of one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s coolest villains Toji Fushiguro, causing the arc to be incredibly tragic. Just like in the Cursed Child arc, this storyline is satisfying on its own due to it being relatively disconnected from the main plot, which elevates it above many arcs on this list.





 5  Perfect Preparation Arc 
        

This arc should probably rank lower on this list for a variety of reasons. Yuji and Megumi&#39;s quest to recruit Hakari for the Culling Game is relatively boring, and the arc is pretty short overall. However, this arc also features Maki&#39;s awakening and the incredibly cathartic slaughter of the Zenin clan, which is one of the best parts of the entire series. Sure that sequence is a bit rough around the edges as Gege didn&#39;t have time to polish it up before release. But the sheer emotional weight and epic scale of the destruction make up for that and make Perfect Preparation a top-tier Jujutsu Kaisen arc.





 4  Vs. Mahito Arc 
        

This arc is one of the most tragic and twisted arcs of the series, which perfectly set the tone for the later arcs to come. The arc does a great job at establishing Mahito as a twisted villain with a personal connection to Yuji. Also Yuji&#39;s friendship with Junpei is touching and his horror upon their death at the hands of Mahito leads to one of the coolest panels in the entire series. Adding Nanami&#39;s introduction along with the multiple fights against Mahito that hinted at how cool Jujutsu Kaisen battles can be makes this easily one of the best arcs in the series despite how early into the manga it comes.





 3  Kyoto Goodwill Event Arc 
        

This arc features an incredible expansion of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s cast of characters by introducing the sorcerers at the Kyoto school. This includes some fan favorites such as Miwa and the hilariously lovable Todo. Not only this but it features some epic fights both between the sorcerers themselves and against the Disaster Curse Hanami who infiltrates the event. In addition to the high-octane fights it also takes the time to show off fun interactions between the high school students such as in the baseball game that takes place after Hanami is defeated. This arc truly has everything that makes Jujutsu Kaisen special which makes it a top 3 arc.





 2  Shinjuku Showdown Arc 
        

Putting this arc so high up on this list may be premature given it is still ongoing. However, the Gojo vs Sukuna fight alone was one of the best things Jujutsu Kaisen has ever done and every chapter after that has just carried forward the story&#39;s momentum. Many fans were understandably upset at Gojo&#39;s shocking death, but even they can&#39;t deny that it served to make Sukuna one of the most threatening Shonen villains of all time. Seeing the rest of the cast scramble to try and defeat him after Gojo&#39;s death just hammers that point home further and makes this unpredictable arc feel simultaneously hopeless and exciting. As the culmination of the entire series this deserves a place at the top of the list.





 1  Shibuya Incident Arc 
        

While the current Shinjuku Showdown arc could eventually dethrone it, the Shibuya Incident currently stands as the best arc in Jujutsu Kaisen. The arc forever changed Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s status quo and its revolutionary nature changed Shonen manga forever. It also featured some of the best and most chaotic fights in the series with each battle bleeding over into the other ones and creating a beautiful whole. As the culmination of everything that came before it, the Shibuya Incident is in equal measure tragic and cathartic, creating one of the best Shonen arcs of all time.
As Jujutsu Kaisen races towards its conclusion, this ranking may change depending on how the final arcs of the series turn out. But no matter how the series concludes, the greatness of these arcs leave a lasting legacy that is sure to influence the next generation of Shonen manga. Even Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s worst arcs have great moments and its best arcs show why it is one of the best modern Shonen series out there.
