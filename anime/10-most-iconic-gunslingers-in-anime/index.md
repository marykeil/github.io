Death the Kid is the son of Death himself, and the most popular character in Soul Eater (an anime famous for its controversial ending). He receives his name from the famous historical gunslinger, Billy the Kid, and fights with his Demon Twin Guns, whose power depends on the strength of the one wielding them.
Death The Kid is a truly extraordinary gunslinger, who has earned his reputation. His long-ranged skills are precise, and he has many attacks that can take out thousands of enemies with a single shot. While gunslingers are generally known for firing bullets, Death the Kid also uses the guns as close-range weapons, using martial arts skills to make them deadly weapons in an up-close fight.

Mista is one of the best characters from JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure and one of the major characters in Golden Wind, as well as one of the most interesting. His Stand is called Sex Pistols, which works in tandem with his marksmanship.
Mista&#39;s Stand are six individuals who look like bullets themselves. He often fires them alongside actual bullets, where they can then redirect his bullets any way he desires. This makes his shots far more precise than any real talent could ever offer him. It also makes his battles far more interesting, with careful tactics that surprise his enemies. His Stand also aids him in loading his gun more swiftly, as they quickly insert the bullets.

He&#39;s always able to shoot precisely where he wants and can hit the same exact spot over and over again without fail. While he is proficient in all sorts of different firearms and has an incredible aim with even non-firearms, his primary gun of choice is a Colt Python handgun.

Kiritsugu does not have a specific weapon that he favors, as he&#39;s constantly seen shifting between various firearms. He is skilled in all ranges of combat, whether it&#39;s sniping, mid-distance, or close combat. His magic is also focused on time manipulation, which dramatically helps improve his already precise marksmanship abilities.

Train, one of the best assassins in anime, spends most of his years as a skilled assassin until he quits and becomes a bounty hunter. However, his skill with a gun never changes. His weapon of choice is a unique revolver called Hades. Hades has many special bullets and abilities, such as the Freeze Bullet, which will freeze anything it hits upon contact. His strongest attack used in the series was called the Burst Railgun, which used both his physical power combined with a bullet. This attack manages to destroy the barrel of Hades, which is supposed to be indestructible.

He primarily specializes in three weapons. Two of them are dual pistols called the Right Head of Cerberus and the Left Head of Cerberus, named after the three-headed dog of the underworld in Greek mythology.

 Alucard (Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate) 





 
Alucard is one of the strongest vampires in anime and the main protagonist of Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate, the latter of which adapts the manga series completely. He is a vampire whose true identity is the infamous Vlad the Impaler and Count Dracula. While he has many incredible vampiric powers, he often focuses on using his two handguns.
The first handgun is a specialized weapon of the Hellsing family designed to kill monsters by using silver bullets. It is named the Hellsing ARMS Casull and is a massive semiautomatic pistol. His other gun is nicknamed the Jackal and was manufactured specifically for Alucard and improves upon the Hellsing ARMS Casull in every regard. Alucard has gun skills, but he more relies on their power, as they create large wounds in his opponents and can even explode upon impact. His vampiric strength and speed also allow him to fire rapidly and take out dozens of monsters swiftly in what is one of the best anime about vampires.





 Vash The Stampede (Trigun/Trigun Stampede) 
        

Vash the Stampede is the main protagonist of Trigun and the new adaptation of the series, Trigun Stampede. He is a cheerful hero who never aims to kill, despite his expertise as a gunman, and he&#39;s one of the best characters with &#34;a no-kill rule.&#34;
Vash&#39;s primary gun of choice is a .45 Long Colt, which happens to be the weapon his brother Knives uses, as well. Due to Vash&#39;s alien abilities, he&#39;s able to perform all sorts of different attacks. This also increases his exactness with his gun. Vash has his fair share of gunfights in the series, but none were better than his final duel with his brother Knives, who was one of the creepiest kids in anime when he was younger. This fight alone is one of the best, if not the best gunfight in anime.
