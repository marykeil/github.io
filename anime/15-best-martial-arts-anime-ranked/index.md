## Literature Review

Whether through skill or strength, martial arts anime like Dragon Ball and Naruto always have characters pushing their limits in incredible fights.





More so than just generic action anime, there&#39;s something special about martial arts anime in particular. Training plays a huge role in this as audiences watch the lead heroes of anime grow stronger and stronger with each passing episode, all culminating in one epic test against another. The best martial arts anime make fighting look beautiful with fluid animation and compelling character moments.









 








 15  Kinnikuman 
        

 Wrestling is actually incredibly popular in Japan, which is why it&#39;s no surprise that one of Shonen Jump&#39;s original big hits was about wrestling. Kinnikuman is a 1983 anime based on the manga of the same name by the mangaka duo Yudetamago. The series follows a goofy superhero named Kinnikuman who must prove himself worthy of his home planet&#39;s throne in a wrestling tournament. Though it&#39;s undeniable that elements of Kinnikuman haven&#39;t aged well, it&#39;s a foundational martial arts series that laid the groundwork for later huge hits like Dragon Ball. Western fans might know the series more for its 2002 sequel series which was localized as Ultimate Muscle. While Kinnikuman might not be the best martial arts anime, its influence and legacy make it a cornerstone of the genre.





 14  Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple 
        

Kenichi is a comedy-filled story of a weakling named Kenichi who becomes an expert martial artist through intense training in various styles of martial arts. In truth, Kenichi is exactly how many fans would expect a clich√© martial arts story to happen. A bullied kid who wants to be good at martial arts finds a hidden master (in this case there are multiple) who trains them into an incredible warrior. Despite the abundance of cliche though, there is a core of real-life martial arts in the show, but as the series progresses, supernatural powers also begin to unlock.





 13  Naruto 
        

Naruto in many ways was the perfect successor to the many martial arts anime that came before it, providing fans with action-packed hand-to-hand combat in addition to its more fantasy-based fights. Naruto has some of the best long fights in shonen anime and is able to do this well with its usage of martial arts. Ninjutsu, taijutsu, and genjutsu are the three types of jutsu utilized in Naruto. Not only does this help fit into the theme of martial arts, but it also adds to the overall theme of shinobi. With some ninja like Rock Lee and Might Guy focussing almost exclusively on the more martial arts based taijutsu, it&#39;s undeniable that Naruto has some truly incredible martial arts scenes.





 12  Megalobox 
        

Taking place in a near future where boxers where exoskeletons to enhance their fighting capabilities, Megalobox is a short martial arts anime that is well worth watching. The series follows a young man known only as Junk Dog as he rises through the ranks of the titular Megalobox sport. Though the series employs the use of science fiction elements such as exoskeletons, Megalobox won critical acclaim for its realistic animation. Boxing has never looked better than it does in Megalobox and that automatically makes it one of the best martial arts anime.





 11  The God of High School 
        

Based on one of the best Webtoon manhwa, The God of High School follows a group of high schoolers who enter the titular tournament in order to have a wish fulfilled. The plot of The God of High School will sound instantly familiar to any fan of fighting games as it features a big martial arts tournament run by a suspicious corporation, an eclectic cast of characters with unique powers, and multiple realms vying for power. Elements like those are popular in fighting games for good reason, and they all add up to making The God of High School fantastic martial arts anime.





 10  Jujutsu Kaisen 
        

Though Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s incredible power system definitely gives it a mystical edge, at its heart, the series is just as much of a martial arts anime as many other hit shonen series. The story follows a young man named Yuji who is inducted into a secret society of sorcerers in order to fight the numerous cursed spirits plaguing Japan. With Studio MAPPA&#39;s signature attention to detail, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s fights look gorgeous in motion, with some truly jaw-dropping animation. Particular mention needs to go to Gojo and Miguel&#39;s fight in Jujutsu Kaisen 0 where the series&#39; most powerful sorcerer delivers one of the best beatdowns in martial arts anime history.





 9  Kengan Ashura 
        

Kengan Ashura focuses on a society where the outcome of fights decides business deals. The series&#39; main character, Ouma, strives to become the world&#39;s strongest martial artist.

 8  Tomorrow&#39;s Joe 
        

Tomorrow&#39;s Joe is easily the most influential anime boxing series. Tomorrow&#39;s Joe tells a compassionate story about a young man named Joe who becomes a boxer under the tutelage of a man named Danpei. While Joe has anger problems outside the ring, Danpei tries to teach Joe how to harness it in his boxing matches. Joe is separated from many of the typical protagonists of martial arts anime who are meek or weak initially and instead is the bully and a delinquent who develops into a kinder and better person over the course of the series.





 7  Bamboo Blade 
        

Sword fighting is an incredibly popular subject for martial arts anime, which is why it&#39;s so surprising that there are few anime about the real sport of kendo like Bamboo Blade. Based on the manga by Masahiro Totsuka and Aguri Igarashi, Bamboo Blade follows an all-female kendo group as they train to face a rival kendo group. Far from the fantastical fights of many martial arts series, Bamboo Blade&#39;s real strength is how grounded it is. Without any embellishments, the series gives kendo the kind of quiet dignity that shows a great deal of respect for the sport. Few martial arts anime are as realistic as Bamboo Blade.





 6  Fist of the North Star 
        

Fist of the North Star is a martial arts tale in a post-apocalyptic world with incredible battles throughout. This story is Bruce Lee meets Mad Max in the best way possible. While the animation of the original anime hasn&#39;t aged well in many areas, the series&#39; incredible influence is felt all through the industry with hits like JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure. Fans of martial arts anime wanting something a little more current may even want to wait for Fist of the North Star&#39;s upcoming anime reboot, which has the potential to be incredible.





 5  Hajime no Ippo: Fighting Spirit 
        

Hajime no Ippo: Fighting Spirit is likely the most recognizable boxing anime and rightly so. Fighting Spirit contains some of the most intense and visually impressive fighting in anime and is guaranteed to get any fan pumped. What&#39;s so incredible about the series&#39; fights is just how unpredictable they are. All of the bouts rarely go the way fans imagine they will, which helps make the show feel more realistic and enjoyable. No one wants to watch a fighting anime where the main character always wins after all. Ippo is another incredibly influential manga series, and its recent adaptation in Fighting Spirit ranks among the best martial arts anime.





 4  Yu Yu Hakusho 
        

Much like many Shonen Jump hits, Yu Yu Hakusho uses a mixture of physical combat and energy attacks to create some truly energetic fights that stick with fans. The series follows a young man named Yusuke who dies after saving a child and is given a second chance at life as a spirit. Though Yu Yu Hakusho initially starts out as a detective series, its later focus on martial arts is where the series truly found its legs. The fighting in Yu Yu Hakusho is thrilling, and the Dark Tournament is easily one of the best tournament arcs in shonen anime.





 3  Baki Hanma 
        

Few martial arts anime can match the utter ridiculousness of Grappler Baki. The series follows a young man named Baki as he trains to become a strong fighter in the world of martial arts. Though the manga has its more grounded moments, the anime adaptation that began in 2018 and continues to this day shows just how wild the series can get as the titular fighter battles an ultra-powerful caveman named Pickle and even a giant praying mantis. The strongest fighters in Baki Hanma are all memorable characters, easily ranking the series among the best martial arts anime ever made.





 2  Samurai Champloo 
        

Coming from the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe, it&#39;s no surprise that Samurai Champloo shows a reverence for martial arts. The series follows the vagabond Mugen and the masterless samurai Jin as they escort a young woman named Fuu through a heavily stylized version of Edo Period Japan. Many things stand out about the series, but particular praise needs to go to just how well the anime captures a wide variety of fighting styles. From Jin&#39;s more thoughtful and reserved sword skills to Mugen&#39;s wild abandon, few other anime make martial arts look quite as good as Samurai Champloo does, easily earning it a rank among the best martial arts anime ever made.





 1  Dragon Ball 
        

Dragon Ball is what many people think of when they think of martial arts anime. The original Dragon Ball series focused on some of the most exciting martial arts fights and tournaments ever seen in any anime or manga. What made Dragon Ball&#39;s fights so revolutionary was how dynamic they were as characters were constantly having to reevaluate their position and strategy in battle. Even Dragon Ball Super has brought technique and skill back into the picture with abilities like Ultra Instinct. Though Dragon Ball Z was more about its explosive battles, it too contained some core martial arts. All of it adds up to making Dragon Ball rank as the best martial arts anime ever made.
Martial arts has always had a place in anime for good reason. At its best, martial arts series can show a character&#39;s personal and physical growth in one epic blowout. There&#39;s also an emphasis on things like stamina in many martial arts series, with characters constantly having to accommodate for their own physical and mental exhaustion. The best martial arts anime take all of these elements and combine them into some of the best fights ever animated.
