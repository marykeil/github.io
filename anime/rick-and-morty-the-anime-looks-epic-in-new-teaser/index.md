## Literature Review

Adult Swim gave anime fans their first glimpse of the upcoming Rick and Morty anime with a small teaser, which shows the mad scientist in action.




Programme Block Adult Swim uploaded a short clip of the upcoming Rick and Morty: The Anime to its YouTube Channel. While running under a minute, it does finally give anime fans a glimpse of how the popular cartoon fares when transferred to Japan&#39;s art style and language. While no premiere date is known, seeing Rick and Summer in motion still shows the project is moving ahead.




Rick and Morty is easily one of Adult Swim&#39;s most successful shows, so it seems natural that they would commission an anime to continue building on its reputation while searching for new audiences with this tie-in work. The anime will reprise a number of creative staff that were already involved in prior Rick and Morty shorts from Japan.


 

With Adult Swim showing off teasers, it is reasonable to expect Rick and Morty to appear sometime in 2024.

The teaser released by Adult Swim on YouTube is not heavy on details, as it mostly shows Rick and Summer involved in flying craft and multiversal shenanigans. The Japanese-dubbed, English-subtitled content does show what language viewers can expect, though an English dub is inevitable. Besides Adult Swim, the anime will stream on Max; its owner, Warner Bros. Discovery, gave more details in a 2022 press release: the anime will have 10 episodes, and &#34;adapt themes and events of the main series&#34;, but &#34;will stand on its own as an original work&#34;. So fans will be getting new storylines, rather than mere cosmetic changes.

Takashi Sano will be directing the anime, with Telecom Animation Film handling production. Notably, Sano has already directed anime shorts based on the franchise, specifically &#34;Rick and Morty vs. Genocider&#34; and &#34;Summer Meets God (Rick Meets Evil)&#34;. While other directors handled other animated shorts, it seems Adult Swim has selected Sano to head the multi-episode venture. Regardless, Sano&#39;s involvement is good news, since the anime is being led by someone familiar with the material. The anime hews close to the original series&#39; look, though the thin lines and flat colors happen to be a natural fit for Japan&#39;s animation work.




Anime spin-offs are a hot fad again, with Scott Pilgrim, The Suicide Squad, and now Rick and Morty getting productions by Japanese studios. Still, of these, Adult Swim could be considered truly invested in the industry, between their work bringing shows to the West, or their funding the long string of FLCL sequels. Suffice to say, they will be invested in making this project, which combines two of their major appeals, not turn out to be a disaster. For now though, this teaser for Rick and Morty: The Anime is all the proof fans have that it&#39;s on its way.
