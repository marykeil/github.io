## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons Episode #29 sees the team encounter a Poké Ball artisan, and this mysterious character has a connection to the mechanic, Orla.




Pokémon Horizons episode #29 sees the airship crew running into a Poké Ball Artisan who happens to be on the lookout for the Ancient Poké Balls as well, and she has some kind of connection with the Rising Volt Tacklers&#39; mechanic, Orla. Here&#39;s how fans can tune in to the latest episode of Pokémon&#39;s new series.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

Pokémon Horizons is currently airing exclusively on the Japanese network TVTokyo. TVTokyo broadcasts take place on Fridays at 6:55 PM JST, which is equivalent to 4:55 AM Eastern Time and 1:55 AM Western Time, a fairly inconvenient time frame for most American fans. Episode #29 of Pokémon Horizons is currently scheduled for 6:55 PM JST on November 17, 2023. Since episode broadcasts are intended for Japanese audiences, these airings will not feature any subtitles, so fans will need some comprehension of the Japanese language in order to follow along. Pokémon Horizons is confirmed for an English dub in late 2023, but no more specific date is currently available.



 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #28? 
          




Pokémon Horizons episode #28 saw Liko, Roy, and Friede paying a visit to an antiques dealer who was once friends with Liko&#39;s grandmother, Diana. However, upon seeing Roy&#39;s Ancient Poké Ball, the antiques dealer stole it, which took the group a short while to notice. What followed was a grand chase across town, as the old man used his team of Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokémon to help keep the ball away from them. Liko and Roy eventually obtained the ball again with Captain Pikachu&#39;s help, and the old man admitted he was planning to sell the ball to a customer--a Poké Ball Artisan who had promised a high price for rare Poké Balls.



 Episode #29 of Pokémon Horizons sees the Team Meet the Poké Ball Artisan 
          

The episode preview for #29 shows that it won&#39;t take long for the Rising Volt Tacklers to track down the artisan in question, who appears to be a young woman. From the preview, she seems to have some kind of relationship to Orla, the crew&#39;s mechanic, and the narration for the preview suggests that Orla might be considering leaving the crew. It&#39;s not clear yet what kind of existing relationship Orla has with the artisan, or if these two plot lines are connected. Orla was one of Friede&#39;s earliest supporters in creating the team, so one can&#39;t help but wonder what might cause her to want to leave at this stage.




While it&#39;s unlikely that Orla will actually leave, it is interesting to see another episode focused on the adult characters in the crew. Orla has yet to have an episode focused on her, like Molly, Murdock, and Friede have, so this will provide a good opportunity to delve into her backstory and explain her reasons for joining the Rising Volt Tacklers. If the situation is causing her to question her decision, then it&#39;s a good idea to revisit why she made this choice in the first place, and to see if this is really what&#39;s right for her.

Pokémon Horizons episode #29 holds the answer to this, as well as the mysteries of the Poké Ball Artisan, so the only way to find out is to watch.

               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
