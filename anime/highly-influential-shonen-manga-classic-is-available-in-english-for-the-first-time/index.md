## Literature Review

Despite its popularity, only now has the seminal boxing manga Hajime no Ippo come Westward with an official release via K Manga





Hajime no Ippo is easily one of the most recognizable sports stories to come out of Japan, and has given fans a still ongoing manga over a hundred volumes long, along with an equally lengthy anime adaptation. Despite its influence, it has only now officially come Westward and in English with the K Manga releases.

 Hajime no Ippo&#39;s First 10 Volumes Are Now Available In English For The First Time 

 

K Drama has its own official synopsis for the series:


What does it feel like to be strong? That&#39;s the question on the mind of Ippo Makunouchi, a clumsy high-school kid who gets bullied a lot. But when he runs into pro boxer Mamoru Takamura, it isn&#39;t long before the dynamite in his fists is unleashed! Dreaming of joining Takamura in the pro ranks, Ippo joins him at the Kamogawa Boxing Gymâ€”and there his quest for true strength begins, in and out of the ring!


The news officially broke on September 26 via K Manga&#39;s official X Account, which proudly announced that it was now hosting the first 87 chapters of Hajime no Ippo, subtitled &#34;Fighting Spirit!&#34; to match the original localized title from the anime. This equals the first ten volumes of a series that&#39;s hit 138 and is still ongoing; author Joji Morikawa himself claims the story is only halfway finished. Surprisingly, despite being published since 1989, and even having an anime adaptation that was released and also localized in the early 2000s, the manga only now has also received its English localization.

 Hajime no Ippo Is A Hugely Influential Shonen Manga 
          

Suffice it to say, this is a major gain for Kodansha and K Manga. Hajime no Ippo is an incredibly important manga, as one of the most well-known blends of sports and battle. Morikawa showed how many shonen genre conventions - training arcs, special techniques, and sideline commentators - were also a natural fit for sporting events. As &#34;mundane&#34; as boxing can be, all it needed was a dose of exaggeration to make it as exciting as any Naruto battle. Combined with excellent character development and a large recognizable cast, and it&#39;s no surprise Ippo currently has 100 million copies in circulation.

The weekly updates are a good sign that K Manga fully intends to cater to new Western audiences despite being years behind Japanese readers. Even if the English chapters will lag behind, readers will eventually find new storylines. While many fans follow the anime, Madhouse&#39;s last episode was in 2014, meaning the manga has a near decade&#39;s worth of extra material. Either way, the internet now has an official source for more Ippo Makunouchi. This year is the perfect time to pick Hajime no Ippo again, as the story can now be followed all the way through to the end.
