## Literature Review

The concept of capturing and forcing Pokémon to fight might feel a little controversial, but the anime actually addressed this problem immediately.





There&#39;s something inherently cruel about trainers beating creatures until they are unable to break free from a small ball that they attempt to trap them inside of once they&#39;ve fallen unconscious. Aside for a few exceptions, these captured creatures usually obey the twisted commands of their captors from then on, even aiding in the subsequent capture of other Pokémon by similar means. However, the anime introduced a surprising concept as early as episode #1 that highly implied Pokémon might actually want to be caught.





 Pokémon Tried To Explain Its Biggest Controversy At The Very Start 
          

In episode #1 of the first Pokémon anime, before becoming best friends, Pikachu and Ash are not in good terms. Pikachu refuses to weaken another Pokémon, causing Ash to act rashly and prompting a Spearow into attacking him. However, the Spearow soon targets Pikachu to Ash&#39;s surprise, which prompts the Pokédex to inform him that wild Pokémon tend to be jealous of human-trained Pokémon. An earlier scene also shows the Pokédex saying that most Pokémon stay in their Pokéball, but there are some who don&#39;t because they hate being confined - which is how Pikachu behaves.

The Pokédex&#39;s explanation as to why Spearow was attacking Pikachu creates some interesting implications. Why would wild Pokémon be jealous of human-trained Pokémon? Since being trained by humans usually involves getting put into Pokéballs and forced to fight other Pokémon, it&#39;s easy to assume that Pokémon must somehow not think negatively of these things. Similarly, by the Pokédex explaining that only some Pokémon hate being confined, this automatically implies that most of them don&#39;t. The explanation given fixes most of these issues: wild Pokémon are jealous of human-trained Pokémon, meaning they actually want to be captured and most of them don&#39;t hate being inside Pokéballs.






 Pokémon Are Actually A Lot More Complex Than They Look 
          

By putting out this explanation so early, the anime is clearly protecting itself from any accusations that wild Pokémon are being &#34;enslaved&#34; by humans, and that, at the very least, Pokémon don&#39;t mind being stored inside otherwise cramped-looking Pokéballs. The fact that wild Pokémon can actually be jealous of those who are trained by humans adds some complex psychological layers to these little critters. If they feel this way then that would mean there&#39;s a part of them that wants to be trained by humans (and thusly get caught by them), and yet all of them resist by fighting back.

These are some highly conflicting messages that however add more layers to the apparently simple creatures known as Pokémon. Even though wild Pokémon feel a strong jealousy about their peers who get to experience a bond with humans - so strong to even attack them - at the same time wild Pokémon also have a natural instinct that drives them to remain free. It&#39;s a compelling conflict that, unfortunately, was never explored because the idea of wild Pokémon being jealous of those with a trainer was never mentioned again, leaving one of the biggest controversies in the series mostly unresolved.
