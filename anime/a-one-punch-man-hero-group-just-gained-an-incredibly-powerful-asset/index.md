## Literature Review

Fubuki tried to recruit Saitama as the newest member of the Blizzard Group, but instead she got another powerful and dangerous asset.





Originally appearing as a villain as an executive of the Monster Association, the dog-like Overgrown Rover was previously tamed by Saitama and started living as his pet. While attempting to recruit Saitama into her group of heroes with the lure of premium meat, Blizzard Group leader Fubuki accidentally wins over Rover instead. In hopes of being able to eat more high-end beef, Rover begins persistently following the Blizzard Group. Initially annoyed by this development, by the end of the chapter, Fubuki witnesses Rover defeating a powerful monster with a single attack and thus welcomes the &#34;pet&#34; as the newest member of the Blizzard Group.




                  One-Punch Man&#39;s Saitama Just Destroyed Fubuki With One Word   For Fubuki, Saitama&#39;s punches aren&#39;t the most devastating thing he could do; instead, he only needed to utter a single word.   


 Overgrown Rover Is A Much-Needed Powerful Addition To The Blizzard Group 
          

Rover joining the Blizzard Group will undoubtedly be an asset for Fubuki. In previous One-Punch Man chapters, Rover has proven to be a powerful creature. Rover has survived battles with members of the Hero Association, including Fubuki herself. Although the combined efforts of Fubuki, Bang, and Bomb previously defeated Rover, this was mostly due to the heroes inadvertently giving Rover a command to sit and be still, but during the fight itself, Rover took little actual damage. Most notable, however, is that in the fight against Saitama, Rover survived a punch, a feat that not even the strongest monsters such as Orochi can boast. While that was not necessarily a &#34;Serious Punch&#34;, the attack still damaged and shook the entire Monster Association base.




Although Rover has shrunk down into a much smaller, weaker form in recent chapters, he is clearly still powerful enough to defeat monsters in a single attack and has a proven track record of durability and resistance to damage. The Blizzard Group has obviously gained a powerful new asset, one that they sorely needed. While after the confrontation between Fubuki and Tatsumaki the Blizzard Group has sworn to become stronger, its members are still pretty weak by One-Punch Man standards. Having Rover on the team means that they will be able to play a more important role in the future, which in turn will also give more spotlight to the fan-favorite Fubuki.



 Fubuki&#39;s Development Is One Of The Best Stories in One-Punch Man 
          

Although it was initially an accident, Overgrown Rover joining with Fubuki and the Blizzard Group could be a significant storyline development with a lot of potential for comedy shenanigans too. Considering how relevant Fubuki&#39;s growth was in the previous story arc, it&#39;s great to not see her disappear to the sidelines already. Fubuki has one of the most interesting character arcs in One-Punch Man, and gaining this powerful asset will hopefully push both Fubuki and the Blizzard Group to a new level.
