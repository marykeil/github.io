## Literature Review

One Piece&#39;s Egghead Arc may bring back a certain group of pirates for its ending which may be far more shocking than fans anticipated.





The Straw Hats&#39; fun futuristic adventure on Egghead has quickly escalated into an overwhelming battle against the full might of the Navy and the World Government and Saint Saturn&#39;s arrival on Egghead has all but confirmed that the conclusion of Egghead&#39;s battle may very well go down as a historic event as hinted in Chapter #1078.




          

However, escape seems all but impossible at the moment, and with news of events constantly leaking, the ending of Egghead could see the Straw Hat Grand Fleet coming to the rescue, making the &#39;great incident&#39; involving the fleet foreshadowed at the end of Dressrosa a reality.

                  One Piece Is Finally Going To Show Roger&#39;s Battle Fans Always Wanted To See   One Piece&#39;s anticipated God Valley flashback is preparing for the epic clash of legendary figures, including Roger and Garp vs the Rocks Pirates.   


 Egghead Will End With Saturn&#39;s Defeat and The Straw Hat Grand Fleet Reappearing 
          




The ending of the Egghead Arc may be the great incident involving the Straw Hat Grand Fleet foreshadowed in Chapter #800. The Navy has a hundred ships surrounding the island and the Straw Hats could need the might of the fleet to hold them off. Moreover, the Pacifista have turned against Vegapunk with Saint Saturn&#39;s arrival and the Seraphim are sure to follow. This suggests that &#34;the great incident&#34; mentioned so many times could be the death of one of the Five Elders, which would be indeed unprecedented but also the only chance for the Straw Hats to escape.

The members of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet have been gaining notoriety since Dressrosa: Leo and Sai have caused much trouble in the Holy land during the Reverie and Bartolomeo even invaded Shanks&#39; territories under the Straw Hats&#39; banner. Unfortunately, most of their adventures have been relegated to Cover Stories, and fans have been eager to see Luffy&#39;s Grand Fleet finally come together. Considering the fleet captains possess Luffy&#39;s vivre card and Morgans is constantly leaking news of the developments on Egghead as seen in Chapter #1074, the fleet is likely aware of the situation and could find their way to Egghead. While the Straw Hats could still escape the island with a Coup de Burst as planned, the fleet may still make an appearance to hold off the marines from pursuing the Sunny to the next island.






 The Return Of The Straw Hat Grand Fleet Will Be a TenYears-Long Foreshadowing Masterpiece 
          

While the appearance of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet seems very likely due to the parallels between the &#34;great incident&#34; mentioned in chapters #800 and #1078, dealing with Saturn will have to come first. Saturn&#39;s defeat and possible death would certainly contribute to the shock factor hinted at in Chapter #1078. Additionally, Chapter #1095 has given fans a glimpse of the highly anticipated God Valley flashback and the chapter draws some interesting parallels between God Valley and Egghead, which both seem to be similarly surrounded by Navy ships. If Saturn were somehow killed or held hostage, the Egghead Incident would surely gain the same level of notoriety as the God Valley Incident which was also covered up for making the World Government seem weak according to Sengoku in Chapter #957.




Nonetheless, Egghead likely still has plenty of exciting exposition in store before the eventual battle against Saint Saturn, who seems all but invincible. Still, the eventual appearance of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet would prove once again Eiichiro Oda&#39;s incredible storytelling ability and his unparalleled mastery of foreshadowing, besides being an incredibly exciting development that One Piece fans have been anticipating for almost a decade.
