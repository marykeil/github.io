## Literature Review

One of Shonen Jump&#39;s most underrated current series The Elusive Samurai is receiving an anime next year and a new visual shows how great it may be.




One of Shonen Jump&#39;s most underrated manga series is getting an anime adaptation, and a new visual shows how epic the show could be. That series is The Elusive Samurai by Yusei Matsui, which follows the young noble Tokiyuki Hojo as they try to reclaim their kingdom. This won&#39;t be the first of Matsui&#39;s works to receive an adaptation, as their manga Assassination Classroom was previously turned into a popular anime, but it will be relatively unique in some key ways.




The Twitter account @MangaMoguraRE recently posted a new visual showing the main cast of the series fighting over a burning emblem. The tweet isn&#39;t the first confirmation of the anime adaptation, which airs in 2024, but it is the first glimpse at what many fan favorite characters will look like in the adaptation.


 

The art done by the studio CloverWorks doesn&#39;t perfectly mirror the manga&#39;s style, but the metaphorical conflict in the image hints that the anime will preserve the striking visual metaphors of the original work. It also captures many of the characters’ personalities well, from the fun-loving Tokiyuki to the menacing villain Takauji.



The series is not connected to Zelda, the Hojo clan symbol just looks like the Triforce.








 The Elusive Samurai is One of Shonen Jump&#39;s Most Underrated Manga 
          

It is good that the visual so clearly captures the characters’ essences well as those characters are one of the main reasons the manga is so compelling. The first arc of the story follows the young Tokiyuki hiding from the Shogunate that usurped his family&#39;s rule and needing to gather powerful retainers around him in preparation to reclaim it. In many ways, this process is similar to Luffy recruiting new Straw Hats in One Piece and the retainers Tokiyuki finds are just as charming as that crew. The manga&#39;s antagonists are just as iconic, with Takauji being one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most disturbing villains.

Hopefully this anime will do justice to one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most underrated series. While The Elusive Samurai is apparently popular in Japan, in the West it is often overlooked for a variety of reasons. Given it is a historical drama about a relatively obscure period in Japanese history, many fans can find its setting and political factions confusing. In addition, the series is often very dense, packed with information about its large cast of characters, its unique setting, and the details of its battles. Even Akane-banashi, Shonen Jump&#39;s superb and revolutionary Rakugo manga, seems to be more followed in the West, despite its obscure subject.






 The Elusive Samurai&#39;s Anime Could Make It a Hit 
          

With the anime coming out in 2024, many fans will now have an easier entry point to the series, which will hopefully increase its popularity. If done well, the series could be a modern classic on par with other Shonen Jump titans like My Hero Academia. Anime fans will have to tune in next year when The Elusive Samurai premieres to see whether it will live up to its full potential or if it will continue to remain one of Shonen Jump’s most underrated series.
