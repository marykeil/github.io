  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Compelling villains are paramount to an enjoyable story, and anime is no exception.
It&rsquo;s difficult to empathize with a hero without a formidable antagonist, which is why every good anime needs a great villain with distinct motivations and methods of wreaking havoc.
Despite their evil actions, these villains have remained popular and memorable, often overshadowing their hero counterparts, proving that compelling villains can be the most interesting characters in anime.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>For villains as evil as these, no method is too immoral. Friend or foe, they will remove anyone standing in their path without any remorse.</p>
<p>While heroes and their companions tend to be the ones in the spotlight, well-written anime villains are just as important to the success of a title. As the more evil ones also tend to be more memorable, the most evil anime villains are those that left a long-lasting impression on fans.
A compelling villain is paramount to an enjoyable story. After all, it’s difficult to empathize with or support a hero fighting against a supposed villain who lacks any ambition or noticeable malice. This is why the evil antagonists, determined to wreak havoc in the world, typically allow for a more engaging experience.</p>
<p>10  Tomura Shigaraki (My Hero Academia)
Based on the Manga Created By Kouhei Horikoshi</p>
<p>Release Year   2016    Number of Episodes   138    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu, Netflix <br>
My Hero Academia’s Tomura Shigaraki is the main antagonist of the series, as well as the leader of the League of Villains, a powerful organization consisting of various villains that, for some reason or another, despise the hero society and aim to destroy it. As the leader, Shigaraki surpasses most other villains in terms of both strength and hatred towards heroes. While he was not necessarily born evil, Shigaraki’s circumstances and upbringing caused him to go down this path. Still, while some may sympathize with his backstory, nothing can change the fact that he’s killed innocent civilians with no remorse and attempted to bring society to ruins.</p>
<p>9  Askeladd (Vinland Saga)
Based on the Manga Created By Makoto Yukimura</p>
<p>Release Year   2019    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Netflix, HIDIVE <br>
Vinland Saga’s Askeladd is a complex character who, despite being the decided antagonist of the first season of the show, managed to find favor with viewers thanks to his charisma and cunning. Unlike other villains, his actions are motivated by certain goals, and he doesn’t wreak havoc indiscriminately, as he is shown to genuinely care about his mother, and the safety of her country, Wales. However, his methods are far from heroic and don’t always reflect his original ambitions. As a Viking, Askeladd would resort to violence with no hesitation, and he murdered and ordered the massacre of entire villages while showing no guilt whatsoever.</p>
<p>8  Light Yagami (Death Note)
Based on the Manga Created By Tsugumi Ooba &amp; Takeshi Obata</p>
<p>Release Year   2006    Number of Episodes   37    Where to Stream It   Hulu, Netflix <br>
Light Yagami, also known as Kira, is an especially interesting case, as he is not the antagonist, but rather the protagonist of Death Note, a role typically reserved for heroes of justice. Truthfully, Light is also primarily motivated by his sense of justice, as he is trying to create a world of honest and kind people, but his methods and progression throughout the show are what make him evil. Upon obtaining the titular Death Note, Light uses its power to rid the world of criminals, seeing his own actions as a necessary evil. However, he eventually reaches a point where he would kill anyone that stands in his way, criminal or not.</p>
<p>7  Shou Tucker (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood)
Based on the Manga Created By Hiromu Arakawa</p>
<p>Release Year   2009    Number of Episodes   64    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu, Netflix <br>
Though Shou Tucker’s role in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was not a major one, his deeds made him one of the most memorable and simultaneously detested characters of the show. Initially, he appears to be a gentle man, albeit admittedly more interested in his work than other people, but a horrific truth is soon revealed. In the name of advancing science, he experimented on other members of his family, specifically his wife, daughter, and dog, sacrificing them only to obtain and maintain his status as a State Alchemist. He may not have killed nearly as many people as other villains did, but he remains the cause of one of Fullmetal Alchemist&rsquo;s darkest moments.</p>
<p>6  Bondrewd (Made in Abyss)
Based on the Manga Created By Akihito Tsukushi</p>
<p>Release Year   2017    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Netflix, HIDIVE <br>
Emblematic of the theme of Made in Abyss, Bondrewd is a man whose darkness and horrors extend far beyond the surface. Though his actions are not motivated by malice and he never appears hostile toward anyone, he is much more terrifying than his emotionless attitude lets on. In the name of science and knowledge, Bondrewd’s research defies all common ethics and morals, as he would experiment on children without a second thought. Whether he turned them into Cartridges or sacrificed them in some other way, no one who met him had a kind fate. He even turned his followers into Umbra Hands, essentially clones of himself, so that his consciousness would never die.</p>
<p>5  Dio Brando (JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure)
Based on the Manga Created By Hirohiko Araki</p>
<p>Release Year   2012    Number of Episodes   50 (Part 1 &amp; Part 3)    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Netflix, Funimation <br>
In stark contrast to JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure’s first protagonist, Jonathan Joestar, who was designed as an unwavering symbol of justice, Dio Brando is an arrogant megalomaniac who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Even when the Joestar family kindly took him in, he never made any effort to get close to them or show any appreciation. Instead, he saw it as an opportunity to deceive them and humiliate Jonathan, in an attempt to take his place. Moreover, his cruelty only grew along with his strength, as he manipulated even his most loyal followers after becoming a vampire, and continued to unapologetically murder anyone who stood in his way. Dio&rsquo;s enduring popularity in the franchise and outside of it proves just how far a good, compelling villain can go.</p>
<p>4  Kyubey (Puella Magi Madoka Magica)
Original Anime Created By Studio Shaft</p>
<p>Release Year   2011    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu, Netflix <br>
As one of the best and most iconic magical girl anime titles, Puella Magi Madoka Magica thrives on surprising viewers by way of shocking reveals. One such example is Kyubey, who, despite appearing innocent and even enchanting at first glance, is eventually shown to be the cause of boundless grief and horrors. While Kyubey can’t technically be considered evil, as the Incubators are an emotionless race, its actions are undoubtedly despicable. Supposedly aiming to prevent the Heat Death of the Universe, it deceives young girls into becoming magical girls, only to doom them to a fate of either dying or being corrupted by despair and becoming witches.</p>
<p>3  Griffith (Berserk)
Based on the Manga Created By Kentarou Miura</p>
<p>Release Year   1997 (Original)    Number of Episodes   25    Where to Stream It   Netflix (Depending on Region) <br>
Berserk’s Griffith is perhaps one of the most polarizing and compelling characters ever. Some may believe that Guts is the reason Griffith became evil, while others may say he was evil from the start. Regardless, it is likely that his ambition to obtain his own kingdom is what mainly caused him to make the choices he became infamous for. As the trusted leader of the Band of the Hawk, whose members were akin to a found family, he eventually betrayed and sacrificed all of them during the fifth Eclipse, when he joined the God Hand in the form of Femto, thus losing what remained of his humanity.</p>
<p>2  Johan Liebert (Monster)
Based on the Manga Created By Naoki Urasawa</p>
<p>Release Year   2004    Number of Episodes   74    Where to Stream It   Hulu, Netflix <br>
Monster’s titular antagonist is Johan Liebert, a man that some would consider the devil himself. Though he may appear to be charismatic and compassionate on the surface, this is all but a facade that he uses to get close to people, manipulate, and corrupt them. Combining his remarkable intelligence with his psychopathic tendencies, he typically avoids killing others directly. Instead, he makes them experience so much suffering that they feel left with no choice but to end their own lives. Moreover, unlike other antagonists, he has no ambition of ruling over the world or changing it in any way. More often than not, he causes destruction purely out of pleasure.</p>
<p>1  Frieza (Dragon Ball)
Based on the Manga Created By Akira Toriyama</p>
<p>Release Year   1989 (Dragon Ball Z)    Number of Episodes   291    Where to Stream It   Crunchyroll, Funimation <br>
Dragon Ball’s Frieza is undoubtedly one of the most infamous and irredeemable anime characters ever. After rising to power at a young age, he quickly became known for his exceptional cruelty and power, proving himself as a merciless tyrant. Sadistic and megalomaniac above all, he would torture people and destroy planets purely for enjoyment. Even his most loyal of followers are not immune to his wrath, as he would slaughter anyone on a whim. However, his cruelest deed has to be the genocide of the Saiyans, which he committed only to avoid any potential threat to his rule, as he deemed their existence too risky. While Frieza may seem a very traditional villain by modern standards, his popularity has rightfully risen him to the status of icon in the anime medium.
Some of these villains cause destruction on a smaller scale, limiting themselves to certain areas that are particularly important or interesting to them. Others feel no need to restrict their chaos, going as far as to obliterate entire planets. Whether they act purely out of pleasure or to advance toward some kind of greater goal, what is certain is that they will stop at nothing to get what they seek, removing anyone who stands in their way. Still, considering how some of them became incredibly popular, sometimes overshadowing their hero counterparts, the most evil anime villains are often the most compelling and interesting characters.</p>
