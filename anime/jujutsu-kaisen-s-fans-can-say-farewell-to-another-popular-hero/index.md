## Literature Review

Sukunaâ€™s return to his original form does not bode well for his opponents, and it suggests that fans&#39; worst fears about another popular hero are true.





While the latest chapter of Jujutsu Kaisen is primarily focused on the fight between Sukuna and Hajime Kashimo, the last panel reveals a startling pivot. Sukuna&#39;s appearance has changed from his modified Megumi physical form to his original body. Previously, this form was only seen in flashbacks of when Sukuna roamed the Earth as himself, before he was defeated by the Jujutsu sorcery community and sealed away. Even more startling than that sight was the implications it raised, namely that Sukuna has completely taken possession of Megumi&#39;s body and permanently overwritten his soul.




                  Sukuna&#39;s Real Form In Jujutsu Kaisen Is The Final Insult To Gojo   Sukuna has finally been reincarnated in Jujutsu Kaisen, and his true form proves the fight against Gojo may have been decided from the start.   


 Sukuna Reveals His True Self, Sealing Megumi&#39;s Fate 
          

For most of the series, fans had gotten used to the idea that whatever manifestation Sukuna would ultimately express, it would somehow be through his possession of Yuji. Indeed, Yuji&#39;s mental toughness proved more than adequate to stamp down any effort by Sukuna to take full control of his body. Sukuna, however, actually used his time in Yuji&#39;s body to search and identify another more useful, and less headstrong, vessel, namely Megumi. Indeed, while &#34;partnering&#34; with Yuji had its benefits, Megumi&#39;s higher sorcerer aptitude and Ten Shadows Technique were much more complimentary to Sukuna&#39;s strengths.




Once Sukuna took possession of Megumi, fans understood the chances of him returning in control of his body. Unlike Yuji, Megumi was more susceptible to the mental torture Sukuna proved so good at. His use of Megumi&#39;s Ten Shadow Technique to hurt Yorozu, the sorcerer possessing the body of Megumi&#39;s sister Tsumiki, was soul-crushing. However, there was always hope that Megumi would somehow deny Sukuna full control, or fight a guerrilla campaign at the spiritual level to sabotage what he could of Sukuna&#39;s powers. Even Satoru Gojo surmised that since Sukuna was still appearing in the modified Megumi form, he was still not in full control.



 Megumi&#39;s Body Now Belongs To Sukuna 
          

However, while that might have been the case during their fight, Sukuna&#39;s transformation into his original form against Hajime suggests that Megumi has been broken and has now no chance to wrestle control of his body back from Sukuna. Perhaps the last break to Megumi&#39;s will was watching his Ten Shadow Technique kill the next person he cared for the most after his sister: Satoru Gojo. Now that Sukuna has unleashed his true, original form upon the world, and considering that Jujutsu Kaisen has shown little hesitation in killing even popular characters, it&#39;s very unlikely that fans will ever see the return of Megumi Fushiguro.
