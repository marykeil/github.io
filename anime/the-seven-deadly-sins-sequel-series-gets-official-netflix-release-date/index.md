# The Seven Deadly Sins  Sequel Series Gets Official Netflix Release Date


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix has picked up the sequel to The Seven Deadly Sins, The Four Knights of the Apocalypse, which will be available for streaming next year.   The new anime is set in the same world but focuses on a different region, making it accessible for both new audiences and old fans.   While Netflix usually releases all episodes at once, it remains unclear how many episodes of The Four Knights of the Apocalypse will be available upon release, as the series will not have been completed in Japan by then.

## Literature Review

A new Netflix trailer confirms that Four Knights of the Apocalypse has been acquired by the streaming service, which will broadcast it next January.




The sequel to The Seven Deadly Sins, subtitled The Four Knights of the Apocalypse, has been picked up by Netflix. While the anime already premiered in October, it currently only broadcasts in Japan. The news was revealed in a trailer that also dropped a broadcast date of January 31 next year.




Given that the entirety of the original anime currently streams on Netflix, it is no surprise that the service would grab the sequel. While it is a sequel set in the same world as Nakaba Suzuki&#39;s prior manga, the focus on a different region should make it easy to approach for both new audiences and old fans.


 

Given Netflix&#39;s style of release, expect The Four Knights of the Apocalypse&#39;s episodes to come all at once.

 The Four Knights of the Apocalypse Releases on Netflix on January 31st 
          




The trailer, currently available on Netflix&#39;s YouTube account, comes with a short description of the anime:


A kind young boy named Percival lives with his grandfather in a remote area called &#34;the Finger of God&#34; â€” but the world would not allow this peace to last. An encounter with a mysterious knight changes Percival&#39;s destiny and reveals a startling secret, causing him to set out on an endless journey.


The Four Knights of the Apocalypse is set 16 years after The Seven Deadly Sins and follows a new cast in the Kingdom of Camelot. While there are notable references to its predecessor - including children of the original cast - the show seems to be viewable by itself. It helps that it follows a different aesthetic and motif: as its title indicates, Arthurian references and knights seem to be a running theme this time around. Furthermore, Percival is a completely fresh face, with no prior history. In this way, interested audiences shouldn&#39;t feel compelled to fastidiously watch The Seven Deadly Sins.




Of course, with both anime now falling under Netflix&#39;s umbrella, it is certainly within the audience&#39;s ability to watch all 100 episodes of the older show before preparing for the sequel. Given that Four Knights arrives next January, the few months before will at least provide some buffer. There is a question about Four Knights&#39; release schedule when it arrives next January, such as how many episodes will be available upon release. While Netflix usually provides all available episodes at once, the series won&#39;t have been completed in Japan by then. A binge wouldn&#39;t bring viewers to completion, then.

Nakaba Suzuki&#39;s manga itself is currently receiving positive reception from fans and critics, and has finished its first part. With this sort of situation, it is likely the animated adaptation will continue, having plenty of material and plenty of interest to continue pushing new seasons through. At any rate, Netflix is now the only stop for international fans who want to watch anything set in the world of Britannia. For fans looking forward to The Seven Deadly Sins: The Four Knights of the Apocalypse, 2024 is a stone&#39;s throw away from having their favorite franchise on demand around the world.
