# Exciting New HIDIVE Anime Combines Isekai With Death Games &amp; a Possible Twist


## SUMMARY 



  The protagonist, Takatou, may have already possessed powers before being transported to the new fantasy world, which breaks the conventional isekai format.   Takatou&#39;s lack of glowing when transported could be explained by him being asleep, suggesting that he received his powers along with everyone else.   The series also tackles the unconventional idea of heroes becoming villains in their second isekai experience, a rarity in isekai anime.

## Literature Review

The first episode of HIDIVE&#39;s My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered is hinting that its death games isekai could be breaking conventions. 




Warning: Spoilers for My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered Episode 1!!






This is an adaptation of the light novel series by Tsuyoshi Fujitaka called My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me!




A thrilling new Isekai series from HIDIVE&#39;s winter lineup called My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered isn&#39;t the first of its kind to incorporate a death game into the main premise, like the manhwa Omniscient Readerâ€™s Viewpoint, nor is it the only Isekai to feature a protagonist with an unrivaled skill that essentially makes them a god. However, the first episode has hinted at the possibility of something that few isekai have done that the series will hopefully confirm later on.

Most isekai protagonists only gain incredible powers once they have inevitably been transported to their new fantasy world. This format naturally complements the genre&#39;s whole &#34;escapism&#34; appeal where the new realm they get isekai&#39;d to is completely out of the ordinary, underscoring their &#34;larger than life&#34; experience.




          

However, HIDIVE viewers are led to believe that protagonist Yogiri Takatou may have already had powers before getting transported, in the debut episode of this adaptation of Tsuyoshi Fujitaka&#39;s original light novel series called My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me!


 It&#39;s Very Likely Takatou Had Powers Before Getting Isekai&#39;d 
Produced by Mainichi Broadcasting System
          

Part of what makes this unconventional likelihood more possible is that when Takatou and his classmates get isekai&#39;d, Takatou&#39;s body doesn&#39;t glow, which happens to the other students who do gain an ability. And yet, Takatou still manges to unleash his eponymous instant death ability regardless. However, the anime was able to create some doubt by having Takatou sleeping when the whole spectacle happened. With this, it&#39;s possible to conclude that Takatou may have still received his powers along with everyone else, but just didn&#39;t glow because he was asleep.




However, the debut episode further complicates everything by cleverly inserting what&#39;s implied to be a dream sequence from when Takatou is asleep. In the dream, a much younger Takatou uses similar powers to save someone named Asaka. Although maybe nothing more than a dream, it&#39;s still possible that the dream could also be functioning as a literal flashback. If that&#39;s the case, then Takatou will be unlike most isekai protagonists, since he would already have had powers to begin with before getting transported to his new fantasy world.



 There Is One Convention Broken in Episode 1 
          

While currently just a very strong theory, what My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered actually does officially tackle unconventionally is how three other characters from Takatou&#39;s party already isekai&#39;d into this new world as heroes. The first time, they were like most protagonists by taking up the mantle as heroes. This second time around clearly demonstrates, however, that the trio ended up getting corrupted by leveraging their experiences to try and exploit their classmates. While there are anime series about protagonists who get isekai&#39;d more than once, it&#39;s rare to see heroes become villains the second time around. One of the few series that&#39;s explored this is the manhwa Hero Has Returned, except it shows how a returning hero becomes a villain in the real world as opposed to in the fantasy realm. Of course, this unprecedented approach in My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered isn&#39;t the main focus of the story and is just explained through useful exposition.




Although not as important to most isekai fans, viewers who are looking for something fresh will undoubtedly appreciate these developments and are most assuredly hoping that HIDIVE will confirm the theory in My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered that Takatou already had fantasy-based powers in the real world before getting isekai&#39;d.
