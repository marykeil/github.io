## Literature Review

Jump Festa is one of the biggest annual events for shonen manga and anime. This year was no different, and delivered huge news for the community.




This year&#39;s Jump Festa was one of the most exciting yet, with many trailers, announcements, and more. Although there were a few disappointments, such as the lack of an anime announcement for beloved ongoing manga like Sakamoto Days, there were many more reasons to be happy.
Jump Festa is a yearly event held by Shueisha where they announce new anime, provide updates for ongoing manga in Jump Magazine, release teaser trailers, and more. Mainstay franchises like One Piece and My Hero Academia have panels almost every year, but it is always exciting to see what new projects will appear during the event.

Interestingly, the anime is set to stream on both Crunchyroll and X (formerly Twitter).

Considering how successful the manga has been for Shonen Jump, Dandadan was always going to receive an anime adaptation, but the teaser trailer blew everyone&#39;s expectations out of the water. Produced by Science SARU, the very essence of the manga was captured in the anime adaptation, and fans found out that they wouldn&#39;t have to wait for greatness too long, as Dandadan is scheduled to release in October 2024.

Oda also revealed that there would be a highly unexpected fight in the next arc which would end with a shocking result.

With the second part of Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War, the third season was announced shortly after. Scheduled for 2024, a trailer was revealed that contained many shocking scenes for fans of the &#34;Big Three&#34; shonen title. With the reintroduction of old characters such as Aizen and Grimmjow, Bleach&#39;s upcoming season will definitely be one of the most anticipated anime of 2024.

The first day of Jump Festa saw My Hero Academia receiving its first official trailer for season 7 after being confirmed to air in Spring 2024. The anime has been a blockbuster release every year, and this upcoming season promises to carry the same effect thanks to the story arc being adapted. The highly anticipated Star and Stripes arc will mark the anime debut of America&#39;s number one hero and Shigaraki facing off in an intense battle. Scheduled for May 4, 2024, My Hero Academia&#39;s seventh installment is sure to uphold the series&#39; long tradition of domination.

 3  Chainsaw Man&#39;s Sequal Is A Movie 
Created by Tatsuki Fujimoto


With how extremely popular Chainsaw Man&#39;s first season was, it was guaranteed that a sequel would be in the works. Although it was assumed that a second season would be announced, Mappa surprised fans by adapting the highly anticipated Rize arc into a movie. As one of the series&#39; best arcs, a movie will surely do it justice given how much resources are put into films and how their animation quality is also better than that in seasonal anime. The release date is not known, and the movie is still in production, so it&#39;ll be quite a bit before Chainsaw Man&#39;s movie hits the cinemas.

 2  Jujutsu Kaisen Is Approaching Its End 
Created by Gege Akutami


As one of the most successful and popular manga of all time, the creator of Jujutsu Kaisen informing fans that the manga will probably end in 2024 was definitely a blow. With the Shinjuku Showdown arc at its climax, it only makes that the series approaches its conclusion as Itadori prepares to take down the main and final villain, Sukuna, in his strongest form. The cover of the new volume and the manga sales so far were also revealed, cementing the series as an all-timer.

 1  One Piece Receives A Remake 
Created by Eiichiro Oda


By far the most shocking and unexpected news of this year&#39;s Jump Festa was that One Piece was confirmed to receive a ground-up remake spearheaded by Netflix and animated by Wit Studio. 2023 was one of the best years for Eiichiro Oda&#39;s iconic franchise: with the live-action being a massive success, the anime&#39;s Wano arc hailed as one of the best in the franchise, and the manga approaching its most exciting arc with all the major players duking it out. This remake has the potential to rid the anime of all its problems, paving the way for One Piece to become the most popular anime of all time.
