## Literature Review

Goku passed down his immense strength to his son, Goten, but unfortunately, Goten inherited Goku&#39;s worst trait as well, and Dragon Ball GT proves it. 


Summary

  Goten, like his father Goku, inherited the trait of dropping his guard during battle, as shown in a Dragon Ball GT episode.   Despite possessing immense power, Goten&#39;s lack of focus and lowered defenses make him vulnerable to attack.   This inherited trait proves that Goten shares Goku&#39;s worst quality, hindering his ability to fully utilize his potential as a fighter in Dragon Ball GT.  





It is no secret that Goku and Goten share a number of similarities that go beyond them just being father and son–from physical appearance and airheaded nature to their love of fighting and penchant for shenanigans–and while that isn’t necessarily a bad thing given the fact that Goku is one of the most powerful fighters in the universe, it is unfortunate in one regard as Dragon Ball GT proves Goten also inherited Goku’s worst trait.




Goten was introduced in Dragon Ball Z following a time-jump after the Cell Saga–a storyline in which Goten’s father, Goku, was killed in battle. While Goten was initially introduced as a happy-go-lucky kid who liked to sneak into tournaments with his friend, Trunks, and get into all sorts of trouble, it was quickly revealed that Goten also possessed a power that was no joke. Before reaching the age of ten, and with zero training from his father (since he was dead), Goten was able to go Super Saiyan–a power Goku and Vegeta nearly had to die to attain. This proved that Goten inherited Goku’s massive power-level, which made his base ki-reading absolutely monstrous–and that’s without the hardened training he would undergo with Trunks leading up to the Majin Buu Saga. Thanks to Goku, Goten had a leg-up on basically any villain he came across, especially earthbound ones–too bad that’s not all Goku passed down to him.

                  Dragon Ball GT Flipped DBZ’s Cell Saga in One Huge Way   The Cell Saga was one of the most impactful sagas in the Dragon Ball Z series, and Dragon Ball GT completely flipped it in one incredibly massive way.   





 Goten Inherited Goku’s Bad Habit of Dropping His Guard 
          

In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 26 (written by Junki Takegami, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), GT’s insanely powerful Machine Mutant villain known as Baby is attacking a city on Earth while searching for Saiyans to possess and steal power from. In response to the widespread chaos, Goten flew to the scene and challenged Baby as he could not allow his villainy to continue. However, Goten went to confront the villain after abandoning a date he was on, so right as Baby was gearing up to attack, Goten gets a call on his cell phone from the girl he was with–a call he absentmindedly answers. Rather than getting off the phone immediately while keeping his attention on his opponent the whole time, Goten completely takes his eyes off Baby and even kicks his feet up in a relaxed pose while floating in the air, casually talking to a girl he likes as if there isn’t a homicidal space robot about to attack him.




It is well-noted throughout the Dragon Ball mythos (especially most recently in Dragon Ball Super) that Goku far too often drops his guard during battle. Goku let his guard down while fighting Majin Vegeta in Dragon Ball Z, which resulted in a shameful loss on his part as Vegeta knocked him unconscious with a single strike. Then, in Dragon Ball Super, Goku lowered his defenses again while fighting Frieza, which resulted in him getting shot by one of Frieza’s henchmen and nearly dying. Now, Goten is experiencing the same problem as shown in this GT episode. Goten was facing-off against an unknown villain of immense power–in fact, Goten even commented that Baby was the strongest fighter he’d ever sensed–and he lowered his guard completely to talk on the phone.

Goten proved in this Dragon Ball GT episode to be just as bad as Goku when it comes to staying focused on his opponent and maintaining his defenses throughout the fight–a strong indicator that Goten did, in fact, inherit Goku’s absolute worst trait.
