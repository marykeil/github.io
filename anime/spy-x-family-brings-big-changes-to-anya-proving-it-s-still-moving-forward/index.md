## Literature Review

Anya&#39;s Term Finals in the latest chapter of the manga shows that Endo is continuing to evolve his story and cast by putting some old gags to bed.




Warning: SPOILERS for chapter #92 of Spy x Family




Chapter #92 of Spy x Family shows a big change in Anya&#39;s character and potentially ties up a plot hole, proving that the series is a lot more than gag comedy. With the help of the Authens, Anya&#39;s grades may stop being so disastrous. Between that and the new emphasis on Anya&#39;s talent in &#34;Classical Language&#34;, author Tatsuya Endo seems to be assuring readers that the esper will find her place at Eden Academy, despite her rocky start.

Tatsuya Endo seems to be in a phase where the story is branching out from its early gags. This includes new stories that find a role for background characters like Millie Myers, the introduction of new ones like the elderly Authens, and recurring jokes like Anya&#39;s poor grades.

          

Chapter #92 in particular seems intent on letting Anya flourish at school, rather than stretch that idea past the point of credulity, as shown in the recurring gag that Anya does not know how to spell her name.

 Anya May Finally Succeed In School Thanks To The Authens 
         

The newest chapter follows Anya dealing with the tests for her Term Finals. While it leads to Loid dreading the inevitable fallout, he still recognizes that Anya&#39;s best subject is Classical Language. More importantly, it serves as an avenue to bring relevance to the new Authen couple, as Sigmund helps tutor Anya in ways that attract her attention and inspire her to study. Having a whole chapter dedicated to Anya&#39;s schoolwork is a major shift for Endo, who has so far been willing to mine it for jokes by making her return home to show one failing score after another.

While funny, it also stretched the suspension of disbelief that Anya was still keeping pace in such an elite school. However, by giving Anya both a subject she excels in, and a tutor to bring up her grades, her clichÃ© niche as the resident &#34;idiot hero&#34; might be done away with. The chapter also provides major developments for both Anya and Loid - as both of them now understand that education can be something fun, rather than a chore. More importantly, Anya is allowed to voice a heartfelt desire to use her knowledge for &#34;world peace&#34;, giving her a long-term goal.




          

Endo still reminds his readers that Anya&#39;s still the same goofball, with the way she marvels at a string of snot, or draws stubble on her chin with a permanent marker. But Chapter #92 is yet another that shows the author is preparing to build up the characters past their stereotypes. Chapter #89 fleshed out Yuri beyond his sis-con gags, while Chapter #91 turned Millie from a background character into the story&#39;s star. Now, Anya is finally allowed to do more at Eden Academy than fail tests for laughs, allowing Spy X Family to expand on her design.

Spy X Family is now available from Viz Media and MANGA Plus.
