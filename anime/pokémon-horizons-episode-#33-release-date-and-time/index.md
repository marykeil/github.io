Pokémon Horizons episode #33 will see an exciting battle take place, and hopefully some of the big mysteries of the series will be unveiled. The previous episode has seen Liko and Roy successfully persuade Lucius&#39; Lapras to go with them, but just as they&#39;re celebrating, the Black Rayquaza appears in the sky. Here&#39;s how fans can tune in to the hit new series and find out what&#39;s next for the crew of the airship.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

Pokémon Horizons releases new episodes exclusively on the Japanese network TVTokyo, at 6:55 PM JST each Friday. As a result, the next new episode of Pokémon Horizons can be expected on December 15, 2023. It&#39;s important to note that 6:55 PM JST is equivalent to 4:55 Eastern Time and 1:55 Pacific Time, making the show&#39;s airing time quite inconvenient for would-be American viewers. The series, being intended for Japanese audiences, is also broadcast without any form of subtitles, making some knowledge of the Japanese language essential to following the plot. Pokémon Horizons&#39; English dub has begun debuting on BBC in the UK, while the American release is now set for February 23, 2024.



Pokémon Horizons will be debuting on Netflix in the US.









 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #32? 
          

Pokémon Horizons episode #32 saw the crew confronting Lucius&#39; Lapras and its band of Pokémon Pirates, who had been covering ships in fog and stealing their cargo while Lapras pretended to help the lost ships find safety. Lapras wasn&#39;t very interested in hearing Liko and the crew out, but Friede and Liko managed to win over its followers by offering them free food and berries.

Lapras was reminded of the promise it made with Lucius long ago, and its former comrades, Galarian Moltres and Arboliva, came out to help convince it to keep that promise. Fans got their first good look at Lucius in a flashback in this episode, and he looks suspiciously like Liko.



 Pokémon Horizons Episode #33 Will Show A Vicious Brawl with Rayquaza 
          




The preview for episode #33 shows Amethio, seemingly not far from the airship, having a battle with the Black Rayquaza. It doesn&#39;t appear to be going well in the preview, as Amethio&#39;s Ceruledge is tossed into a rocky island at high speed when it attempts to attack. Seeing the Black Rayquaza seems to be a big deal for Terapagos as well, as the preview strongly suggests it will finally take on its true form in this episode. The Black Rayquaza has always had a crystalline sheen to it, which may be related to Terapagos&#39; abilities. Timed to align with the release of Scarlet and Violet&#39;s DLC, it seems fans will finally get to see the real Terapagos.

With Lapras added to their ranks, the Rising Volt Tacklers now have three of the six Pokémon mentioned in Lucius&#39;s myth at their disposal. It seems unlikely that Rayquaza will be convinced in the next episode, but perhaps merely seeing it and making contact with it will help Terapagos, or provide a clue as to where to look for the remaining Pokémon. It will also be interesting to see what Amethio is up to; he&#39;s been training, and last said he was on the hunt for the Black Rayquaza, hoping it would lead him to the airship again.




Episode #33 of Pokémon Horizons is shaping up to be a momentous one for this new but already exciting and successful series.
