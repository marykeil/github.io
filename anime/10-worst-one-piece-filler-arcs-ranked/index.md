## Literature Review

From Spa Island and Goat Island to Ice Hunter and Cidre Guild, and more, discover the most underwhelming filler arcs in One Piece history.  




Of the many divisive aspects of One Piece&#39;s anime, the one thing most fans agree to hate is the overabundance of non-canon filler arcs unnecessary to the overarching story. While some unrelated one-off story arcs are more amusing than others, the worst often feel superfluous and underdeveloped, lack compelling characterizations, and drop the ball in terms of storytelling.
Whether they&#39;ve featured the most detestable characters, contained unneeded recaps, ran for too long, or had dull and shallow stories, a handful of underwhelming One Piece filler arcs have left fans feeling cold over the past two decades. The worst One Piece filler arcs just don&#39;t capture the magic that makes the world&#39;s most famous pirate anime/manga franchise so thrilling.
            
 
 One Piece Filler List: Every Episode You Can Skip 
As with any anime series, One Piece comes with a selection of filler episodes. Which adventures aren&#39;t canon, and which One Piece arcs can you skip?












 








 10  The Post-Alabasta Arc is a Lackluster Followup to One of the Series&#39; Best Stories 
One Piece Episodes 131-135
        

Following what many consider to be one of the best main story arcs in One Piece, the five-episode filler arc that follows Alabasta pales in comparison. The Straw Hats sail to their next port and tell stories about themselves and the adventures they went on before becoming Straw Hats. Unfortunately, with poor pacing, awkward execution, and Luffy&#39;s lack of testimony, the arc leaves a lot to be desired.
While the filler arc has nothing to do with the main narrative and the personal anecdotes the crew relays do not advance the story in any substantial way, viewers at least get to learn a little more about the goals and histories of Nami, Chopper, Sanji, Usopp, and Zoro. Still, coming on the heels of the exciting action in the main Alabasta arc, the follow-up feels a bit limp.





 9  The Warship Island Arc Contradicts One Piece Canon 
One Piece Episodes 54-61
        

One Piece&#39;s first filler arc, the Warship Island arc, has slightly more depth than the tired and trampled ones that take place down the line. Still, many fans felt the story of The Straw Hats rescuing a girl named Apis and assisting her with returning a dragon to its village had too many plot holes, an overhyped villain that never paid off, and confusion relating to the Punk Hazard and Alabasta main arcs.
Contradicting the main narrative by having the Straw Hats claim they&#39;ve never seen a dragon 500 episodes later in Punk Hazard, Zoro also claims he can cut through anything in Watership Island, but proves the opposite later in Alabasta. Between these inconsistencies and Luffy&#39;s lame showdown with Eric, it&#39;s one of the most confusing shonen anime arcs on record.





 8  Goat Island Arc Ranks Among One Piece&#39;s Most Forgetable 
One Piece Episodes 136-138
        

Directly following the Post-Alabasta filler arc was One Piece&#39;s Goat Island arc. The Straw Hats arrive at Goat Island and help a quirky old man named Zenny and his herd of goats, which help Luffy and his crew fight off a Marine attack. While the arc does not advance the main story in any meaningful way, the droll interplay and witty banter between Zenny and the crew are fairly amusing. Despite a few genuinely funny exchanges between Zenny and the goats attacking the Marines somewhat memorable, the storyline of the arc itself is pretty forgettable and is easy to skip without missing the larger and more significant plot points.

 7  Caesar Retrieval Arc Has a Solid Setup But Disappointing Payoff 
One Piece Episodes 626-628


 







Tied for the second-shortest filler arc, One Piece&#39;s Caesar Retrieval arc finds the already-kidnapped Caesar Clown being abducted from the Straw Hats as they sail to Dressrosa. The Straw Hats must team with the Heart Pirates to defeat Doflamingo and Kaido to get Caesar back. Despite a solid setup, very little happens during the arc, leading to the villain using his Devil Fruit on himself in a total cop-out of a conclusion. Although the arc provides some development for Law&#39;s relationship with the Straw Hats and some decent action with Luffy and Chopper pursuing Captain Breed, the three episodes are fairly standard and do not add much to the overarching narrative.





 6  Cidre Guild Arc is One Piece&#39;s Shortest (and Most Forgettable) Filler Arc 
One Piece Episodes 895-896
        

With just two episodes, One Piece&#39;s Cidre Guild arc is the shortest filler arc in One Piece and is extremely forgettable as a result. The arc is about Luffy fighting the Cidre Guild bounty hunters with Boa Hancock after trying to buy soda for the Thousand Sunny. Beyond the short runtime, one of the main reasons the filler arc fails to resonate is that it does not take place between two main Arcs as most do. Instead, the Cidre Guild Arc took place while the Wano County Arc was still ongoing, which left many fans bewildered as to what the point was. While the Cidre Guild Arc does tie into the One Piece: Stampede movie, its lack of context otherwise hurts its effectiveness.





 5  Boss Luffy Historical Special Arcs Are Just Confusing &amp; Alienating 
One Piece Episodes 291-292, 303, 406-407


 







As tangential and unrelated as filler arcs come, the Boss Luffy Historical Specials are fun enough on their own but have no real bearing on the larger One Piece canon. Set in an alternate universe in Japan&#39;s Edo period, the filler episodes feel wildly out of place and usually end up confusing and alienating viewers. For instance, the first two episodes aired right in the middle of the Enies Lobby Arc, which disrupted the flow of the main narrative and confounded audiences in the process. Moreover, while it&#39;s entertaining to watch the Straw Hats explore an alternate historical epoch, the Wano County Arc went into much further depth in the depiction of Samurai culture and ended with much more satisfying results.





 4  Spa Island Arc is Obnoxious &amp; Boring in Equal Measure 
One Piece Episodes 382-384
        

Set right after the fan-favorite Thriller Bark Arc was One Piece&#39;s Spa Island arc, where the Straw Hats&#39; vacation on the titular Spa Island is interrupted by the return of the Foxy Pirates. Despite some solid HD animation, the short-lived filler arc was forgettable at best and downright terrible at worst. With a leisurely pace to go with the Straw Hats&#39; restful downtime, not much happens in the story other than encountering the extremely obnoxious Foxy and his mates Porche and Hamburg. While it&#39;s nice to see Brook included in his first filler arc, the jokes don&#39;t land, the plot falls flat, and the new character introductions are as unpleasant as they come.





 3  Ice Hunter Arc is Slow as a Glacier 
One Piece Episodes 326-335
        

Set between the awesome Enies Lobby and Thriller Bark Arcs was One Piece&#39;s Ice Hunter arc, which is infamous for its slow pacing. With roughly one episode of story material stretched over 10 slogging chapters, the second-longest filler arc in One Piece saw the Straw Hats sailing from Water 7 through The Florian Triangle to reach a winter island, where a band of bounty hunters steal the Thousand Sunny&#39;s flag.
For most anime fans, the beauty of filler episodes is how short and sweet they are, allowing for a slight diversion before delving right back into the main cannon narrative. The Ice Hunter simply turned off fans who had to wait months for the inconsequential filler arc to finish.





 2  Ocean&#39;s Dream Arc is Nothing But Boring Recaps 
One Piece Episodes 220-224


 







Much like the repetitive Post-Enies Lobby Arc, One Piece&#39;s Ocean&#39;s Dream arc is nothing but a series of unnecessary recaps that simply regurgitate what&#39;s already been seen. While other lackluster One Piece filler arcs attempt to tell wholly original stories, the Ocean&#39;s Dream arc does none of that and just takes its story cues from the One Piece video game, Ocean&#39;s Dream. Due to the characters waking up with amnesia, the whole plot concerns the Straw Hats regaining their memory and retelling their past histories, so it has nothing new to add towards advancing the main storyline, making it an arc more than worth skipping.





 1  Foxy&#39;s Return Arc is One Piece&#39;s Worst Arc Bar None 
One Piece Episodes 225-226
        

Of all the One Piece filler arcs, the one that stands out as the worst is One Piece&#39;s Foxy&#39;s Return arc. Set after the repetitive Ocean&#39;s Dream arc, the plot finds the return of Foxy the Silver Fox, a character who had already overstayed his welcome in the anime&#39;s extended version of the Davy Back Fight. Worse yet, Foxy is somehow made the star of his own side story in which fans are meant to conjure sympathy and root for his success, but it failed entirely, and the resulting Davy Back Fight was not only supremely underwhelming, but it also did nothing to help viewers understand the wider One Piece mythos. The end result makes Foxy&#39;s Return One Piece&#39;s worst filler arc.
