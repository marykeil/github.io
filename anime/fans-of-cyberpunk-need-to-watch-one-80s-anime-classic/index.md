## Literature Review

Bubblegum Crisis is a fun, stylish approach to sci-fi anime that every fan of series like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners should be willing to give a chance.




From the opening moments of the very first episode, it was clear that Bubblegum Crisis would be a stylish classic representing peak 80s sci-fi anime. Beginning with an eight-episode series that aired in 1987, the cult classic cyberpunk anime Bubblegum Crisis was followed by a three-episode series in 1991 meant to provide the original series with the ending it didn&#39;t get the opportunity to deliver in the original series. From there, it received a remake/reboot in the late 1990s called Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 and two prequel series. Bubblegum Crisis is a gem of both Cyberpunk and 80s anime and is a must-watch for Sci-Fi fans.




The female-led Sci-Fi series follows the four Knight Sabers, mercenaries in high-tech &#34;hardsuits&#34; and an impressive arsenal of weapons. The Knight Sabers fight cyborgs called Boomers, sort of equal parts the Replicants from Blade Runner and the classic Terminator endoskeleton. Thanks to the abilities of the hardsuits, the Knight Sabers are seriously powerful fighters and the stylish action of Bubblegum Crisis is eye-catching and creates many unforgettable moments in the series.

The tone of the series is established right from the opening scene. Priss, one of the Knight Sabers and the series&#39; main protagonist, moonlights as a singer and the opening montage of Bubblegum Crisis cuts between scenes of her concert and the other Knight Sabers and the AD Police fighting Boomers. This specific song is a fantastic introduction to the series, and is a genuinely enjoyable piece of music in its own right. The pure 80s soundtrack is consistently one of the greatest strengths within the series.




 : 10 Best Characters From 80s Anime, RankedAs for the setting of a cyberpunk series, Bubblegum Crisis&#39;s Tokyo isn&#39;t exactly a great place. Although it&#39;s outwardly bright and slick and illuminated with neon lights, its true face is decaying and dystopian. Bubblegum Crisis nails the Cyberpunk setting and esthetic, but due in part to being more action-oriented than purely expository or philosophical, the series is never quite as dark or bleak as the genre usually is. There are moments of legitimate emotional weight and tragedy and a certain level of cynicism pervading the dystopian setting, but Bubblegum Crisis is never quite as soul-crushingly bleak or ever feels quite as futile as other Cyberpunk series like Edgerunners.

         

Bubblegum Crisis synthesizes a lot of classic genre tropes to create a series that feels simultaneously familiar and unique. The Boomers look like Terminators, and are capable of growing to superhuman sizes. The hardsuits owe a clear debt to Iron Man&#39;s suits, but have a sleek visual design and a diverse slate of powers. The dystopian future Tokyo invokes classic anime film and manga Akira, but the actual plot goes in a completely unique direction. Fundamentally, Bubblegum Crisis is greater than the sum of its part and thanks to combining this novel approach to classic aspects of genre with a strong and engaging female-led cast, the series stands out among Sci-Fi anime.




Thanks to recent success of Cyberpunk 2077 and its Edgerunners anime adaptation, the Cyberpunk genre has been undergoing a resurgence lately. This is the perfect opportunity to revisit some of the early classics in the genre, and Bubblegum Crisis is the perfect place to start. A gem of 80s anime, Bubblegum Crisis is a must-watch for Cyberpunk fans.
