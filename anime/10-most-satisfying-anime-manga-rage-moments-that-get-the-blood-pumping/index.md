## Literature Review

Fights in anime involve many emotions but sometimes anger takes over. These are the best depictions of rage in anime and manga.





More so than just satisfying and entertaining, the best rage moments in anime can be incredible catharsis. It&#39;s not enough for a hero to just get angry out of nowhere, for a rage moment to truly work, the build-up is just as important as the payoff. When one of these bursts of fury works, it can be the culmination of a character arc or the beginning of a hero going down a dark path.

 10  Izuku Midoriya Vs. Overhaul - My Hero Academia 
        

One of the most enjoyable parts in anime fights is when a reserved character loses all composure and goes into rage mode. That&#39;s exactly what happened in My Hero Academia when Midoriya fought Overhaul. The fight took place after Overhaul killed Sir Nighteye. What really pushed Deku off the edge was his anger at himself that he couldn&#39;t protect the young Eri. Although his rage moment was epic, he didn&#39;t completely lose it and was still to think clearly, unlike other anime characters who fully gave into their anger. This fight showed just how powerful Deku is at 100% output, and it&#39;s going to be amazing to see him consistently use his full power once Deku masters One For All.





 9  Yuji Itadori Vs. Mahito - Jujutsu Kaisen 
        

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Yuji is one of the most kind-hearted anime heroes, and he risks his life to protect the weak. However, he is still human and gets angry like most people. Itadori rarely gets angry, but when he does, the recipient of his rage is basically doomed. He made a close friend in Junpei and they bonded deeply. When Junpei&#39;s mother was killed, and he flew into a rage, Yuji convinced the confused young man to join Jujutsu High with him. That&#39;s when Mahito killed Junpei in front of Yuji. Heartbroken by his friend&#39;s death and frustrated at Sukuna refusing to help, he lost it. He unleashed a rush of attacks but unfortunately, Mahito got away. He finally has a chance to get revenge in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s game-changing Shibuya Incident Arc, and it&#39;ll be a fight for the ages.





 8  Thorfinn&#39;s Hatred of Askeladd - Vinland Saga 
        

Vinland Saga&#39;s Thorfinn got a taste of war and the outside world after repeated warnings from his father Thors. He snuck onto a boat that his father and others were using to head off to war. When the boat was ambushed by the mercenary Askeladd and his crew, the mighty Thors fought them and defeated them all, but Askeladd played a dirty trick by taking a hostage. In exchange for letting the hostage go, Thors surrendered, and was promptly killed. Although the rest of the people were let go, Thorfinn once again snuck onto Askeladd&#39;s boat. Thorfinn was a troubled kid and his anger was always on display, but the scream and rage he let out when he snuck on the boat was unlike anything else. Despite being only a child, his anger intimidated the crew and shocked Askeladd himself.





 7  Obito Uchiha Becomes a Villain - Naruto 
        

Obito&#39;s angriest moment in Naruto is also when he changed his outlook on life and became a villain. He was presumed dead in the Third Shinobi World War, but he was saved by Madara. After months of staying in bed and healing, he was informed that his friends Kakashi and Rin were in trouble. Determined to save his friends from the pursuing enemies, he rushed to the scene but what he saw plunged him into an abyss he&#39;d never climb out of. He saw Kakashi piercing Rin&#39;s heart with the Chidori. In what can only be described as a massacre, he let out a cry and he killed all his enemies. Obito held Rin&#39;s dead body and wept for her. The sheer scale of Obito&#39;s rage activated the Mangekyo Sharingan and created one of Naruto&#39;s strongest villains.





 6  Levi Ackerman Vs. the Beast Titan - Attack on Titan 
        

Known as humanity&#39;s strongest soldier, Attack on Titan&#39;s Levi is used to seeing his comrades fall in battle. All his life he has seen loved ones die, from his mother to his friends. However, what the Beast Titan did to his friends and Captain Erwin unleashed a wrath never seen before. While the scouts and Erwin were distracting the Beast Titan, Levi sneakily went around the Titan&#39;s field of vision and ambushed him. With incredible speed and agility, Levi cut him down all over his body and cut Zeke out of the Titan. Although Zeke escaped, Levi&#39;s rage gave fans one of the best moments in a series that is action-packed.





 5  Monkey D. Luffy Vs. Charlos - One Piece 
        

Nobody can talk back to the Celestial Dragons in One Piece. They have the backing of the full force of the Navy, and so they abuse it. Saint Charlos was treating everybody at the auction however he pleased, especially the Fishmen and slaves. He stepped out of line when he shot Luffy&#39;s friend Octo. After watching Charlos&#39; antics, Luffy couldn&#39;t hold back and delivered a powerful right hook. Although the consequences were huge, Luffy didn&#39;t care and cared more about his friends than what his actions could mean. His silent demeanor and anger before knocking out Charlos makes this one of anime&#39;s most unique rage moments.





 4  Gohan Vs. Cell - Dragon Ball Z 
        

Quite possibly the best moment in Dragon Ball Z, Gohan despite his young age defeated Perfect Cell, a villain who powerhouses like Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks were no match for. Cell made the deadly mistake of killing Android 16 in front of Gohan and then proceeded to taunt him, awakening an anger the young Saiyan didn&#39;t know he possessed. Lamenting his weakness and the suffering of his friends at the hands of Cell, Gohan powered up and became the first Saiyan to achieve Super Saiyan 2. He wiped the floor with Cell and killed him. Gohan was always gifted, so it was no surprise he achieved such a monumental feat, but using a rage moment to power up was brilliant, and it cemented the scene as one of the best in anime.





 3  Roy Mustang Vs. Envy - Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood 
        

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&#39;s Colonel Roy Mustang was devastated by the murder of his best friend Maes Hughes and vowed to take down his killer. He was on a quest for revenge, and even his lieutenant noticed just how much he changed. He brutally took down the murderer&#39;s accomplice and once he found the killer, he lost all his senses. He launched a barrage of flames at Envy, bringing the shapeshifting villain to death&#39;s door over and over again. Roy Mustang&#39;s quest for revenge spanned most of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and his relentless takedown of Envy was a culmination of pent-up anger and sadness.





 2  Guts During the Eclipse - Berserk 
        

There are not that many anime characters who have faced as many hardships and suffering as Guts from Berserk. That&#39;s why it is understandable that he loses his senses due to anger so often. However, his most intense moment of anger came during the Eclipse after he was betrayed by someone he thought was a friend: Griffith. After seeing his lover violated and his friends killed, Guts flew into a blind rage. His anger was one of the most violent ever, as he ripped off his arm during the scene. Very few anime rage moments are as visceral as Guts&#39; during the eclipse, however only one moment manages to top it.





 1  Gon Freecs Vs. Neferpitou - Hunter x Hunter 
        

Hunter x Hunter&#39;s Gon takes the top rank for the most incredible depiction of anger in anime. What he did to Neferpitou was hard to watch, even though Pitou was beyond evil. Once Gon found out that Kite was dead, the only thing on his mind was ending Pitou. His thirst for vengeance was so strong that he sacrificed his lifespan and body for a temporary power-up, making him as strong as Meruem. He easily killed Pitou, but his body was beyond saving. It took a supernatural power that broke the universe&#39;s laws to heal him. What made his wrath stronger was that he held out hope that Kite was alive, but it was shattered along with his mind when he found out the truth.
Because of the action nature of shonen, there will always be flaring of emotions, particularly anger. There are many awesome portrayals of anger such as Ichigo, Naruto, Mob, and many others. They were all amazing to witness and had fans at the edge of their seats. However, the best anime rage moments stand at the top due to just how satisfying and thrilling they are to watch.
