# Shonen Jump May Have Found its Jujutsu Kaisen Replacement With Exciting New Series


## SUMMARY 



  Shadow Eliminators could be a replacement for Jujutsu Kaisen once it ends, but it needs to meet Shonen Jump&#39;s tough standards.   Shadow Eliminators and Jujutsu Kaisen share similarities in terms of cursed spirits and moral-driven protagonists.   For Shadow Eliminators to truly replace Jujutsu Kaisen, it needs a complex power system like Cursed Energy or do the unexpected and go for something simpler.

## Literature Review

Shadow Eliminators is a new Shonen Jump series that&#39;s giving similar vibes to Jujutsu Kaisen, and could replace the hit manga when it ends.




Warning: Spoilers for Shadow Eliminators chapter #1




A new Shonen Jump series called Shadow Eliminators could serve as a replacement for Jujutsu Kaisen once the veteran manga officially ends. Of course, Shadow Eliminators would have to miraculously meet Shonen Jump&#39;s overly harsh conditions first, which have led to the premature cancelations of too many series. Regardless, Shadow Eliminators and Jujutsu Kaisen share many similarities that fans might find exciting.

Jujutsu Kaisen appears to be in its final arc, even if series creator Gege Akutami assured fans that Jujutsu Kaisen will continue well into 2024 so he can address the many loose ends that still remain in his story. Despite this, as a highly popular series, the void that Jujutsu Kaisen will leave behind in its absence will be notable.

          

Luckily, fans have a new series to hopefully look forward to every week as Jujutsu Kaisen comes to a close called Shadow Eliminators, by first-time mangaka Kento Amemiya





 Shadow Eliminators Has Its Own &#34;Curses&#34; and &#34;Yuji&#34; 
          

Shadow Eliminators features malicious spirits called Threads that might as well be considered Curses. Much like how these cursed spirits are born from negative emotions in Jujutsu Kaisen, Threads are able to attach themselves to similar feelings as well as strong passions in general, allowing them to take physical form in the human world as beings called Kasane. These Kasane appear to be more likely to possess humans who don&#39;t put up a resistance to them. The only similar example of this happening in Jujutsu Kaisen is the bond between the powerful jujutsu sorcerer Yuta and his cursed spirit Rika.

Shadow Eliminators&#39; protagonist Yayoi Asakaze also shares a strong moral code that he inherited from a grandparent. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuji becomes driven by a desire to help others with his strength after his dying grandfather points him in this direction. Yayoi is also influenced by his grandfather, who was a cop. His grandfather&#39;s ideals of doing the right thing is what helps shape Yayoi&#39;s own obsession to protect those from injustice and unfairness. Yayoi himself doesn&#39;t possess any special powers, and yet, this innate drive in him allows him to confront a Kasane and help the powerful Aoba Kuromori who uses jutsu to defeat Kasane.




          

Although only one chapter of Shadow Eliminators has been released, Jujutsu Kaisen fans can at least cling to the few similarities in those first 57 pages as possibly being the first of many correlations to come. Of course, Jujutsu Kaisen is more than just cursed spirits and grandfather-loving protagonists. The series is both lauded and critiqued for its highly complex power system. For Shadow Eliminators to truly replace Jujutsu Kaisen, it will have to find a power system that&#39;s as deep and nuanced as Cursed Energy, or do the unexpcted and opt for a much simpler one. While Shadow Eliminators seems promising, it has a long way to go before Shonen Jump can claim it has found the next Jujutsu Kaisen.

Shadow Eliminators is available from Shonen Jump or Manga PLUS
