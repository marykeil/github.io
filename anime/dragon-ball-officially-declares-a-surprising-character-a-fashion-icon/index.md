# Dragon Ball Officially Declares a Surprising Character a Fashion Icon


## SUMMARY 



  Master Roshi, a classic character from Dragon Ball, is being recognized as a fashion icon with his unique Turtle Hermit style.   His fashion choices, including Hawaiian shirts and Chinese-inspired shirts, were trendy in the 1980s when the series was created.   Despite his age, Master Roshi&#39;s practical and adaptable fashion sense deserves more recognition as an underrated style.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball has several iconic costumes for characters, but one character&#39;s sense of fashion is highly underrated according to Dragon Ball Official.




When it comes to fashion in Dragon Ball, Bulma is usually considered the primary icon, alongside Goku&#39;s training look. However, the official site for the hit manga has declared that another classic character is a fashion icon in their own right. Fans should trade in their Goku-inspired gis for Master Roshi wardrobes.




Dragon Ball began serializing forty years ago in 1984. It was created by Akira Toriyama and is one of the most successful manga and anime franchises in the world. The franchise also has some of the most recognizable characters and outfits, with Goku&#39;s orange gi and Vegeta&#39;s Ginyu Force suit being notable fashion statements. Bulma&#39;s fashion has also included several fun and noteworthy outfits.

          

However, Dragon Ball Official has shared reasons why Master Roshi, or Kame-sennin, should also be considered a fashion icon worth being inspired by. His look may seem a bit old school and rather dated, but there are subtle details that ensure he&#39;s keeping up with trends. As a result, fans may be surprised by what a professional in the fashion industry has to say about his sense of style.

Master Roshi is known for his martial arts skills, as well as his mentorship of Goku and Krillin. One of the series&#39; original characters, he is also often thought of more for his perverted tendencies than his sense of style. Nonetheless, when broken down, he actually has great fashion sense - even if it isn&#39;t to most young readers&#39; and viewers&#39; tastes. He has what should be referred to as &#34;Turtle Hermit&#34; style. He is frequently seen wearing a turtle shell combined with brightly patterned shirts, such as the orange Hawaiian shirt with assorted letters on it. These shirts are often paired with barely visible shorts, sandals, and a pair of sunglasses.




At other times, Master Roshi notably wears Chinese-style shirts, such as the black one seen in the Tournament Saga arc, which was published in 1985. This is a major part of his Jackie Chun disguise. He also has a similarly styled orange shirt that he occasionally wears when not in disguise. According to Dragon Ball Official, both of these styles were very popular in Japan in the 1980s, when the series was being created and released. Updates to Roshi&#39;s fashion sense can be seen in the changing shapes of his sunglasses, which often fit the time that the series is debuting, going from very round to more angular over time.



 Turtle Hermit Fashion is an Underrated Fashion Style That Deserves More Recognition 
          

Though Master Roshi&#39;s sense of style may not be very youthful by nature of his character design, he did manage to hit the trends of his initial era. Additionally, his look is very fitting of his age, being classic in its elements. He is also very practical since he lives in an island home, which could be in a tropical or beachy climate. As a result, he combines fashion and function, opting for traditional martial arts attire when he needs it. He adapts to events and updates his eyewear, shifting up his outfit subtly, but enough to be trendy without much effort. Master Roshi should definitely be counted as a fashion icon, particularly since his Turtle Hermit style is severely underrated.
