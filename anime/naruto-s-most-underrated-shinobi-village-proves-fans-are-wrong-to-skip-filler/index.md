## Literature Review

Those who chose to skip Naruto&#39;s fillers missed out on one of its most emotional stories, set in the underrated Village Hidden Among Stars.





As this village is introduced in one of Naruto&#39;s filler episodes, pertaining to the Star Guard Mission arc, it is likely that some fans of the show missed it. While it is true that this location, and the story associated with it, may not be important to the rest of the series, that doesn&#39;t stop it from being one of the most interesting and memorable parts of the original show.

The name of the Village Hidden Among Stars most likely comes from its origins, as it was formed around a fallen meteorite which locals refer to as the &#34;star&#34;. What&#39;s interesting about this meteorite is that it emits radiation that can greatly increase chakra strength and levels, theoretically allowing the shinobi of this village to gain unrivaled chakra control and enough strength to stand against even the most powerful characters in Naruto. Naturally, harnessing the power of the meteorite is no easy task, with a certain arduous training method being required to fully master the &#34;Mysterious Peacock Method&#34;, as the technique is called.

Given just how powerful and versatile this technique is, it should come as a surprise that this village isn&#39;t more recognized, with even its Kage not being acknowledged by the others. However, the reason for that is simple - this technique comes at a steep cost, with its users being weakened or even dying as a result. This makes the meteorite a double-edged sword, whose power the village needs, should they insist on being recognized as a powerful group, yet which also threatens the people&#39;s very existence and stability. The conflicting views of the shinobi indicate just how difficult it is for an ordinary village to prove its strength and independence.

Besides showing how tough the shinobi world can be at a macro level, with people exposing themselves to great risks in order to be recognized, this village also serves as the setting for one of Naruto&#39;s most emotional stories. This is where Naruto meets Sumaru, a fellow supposedly orphan Genin who dreams of becoming his village&#39;s Kage. Later on, it is revealed that Sumaru&#39;s mother actually faked her death, and continued to watch over the village, waiting for a chance to stop the new leader from putting more people in danger by forcing them to undergo dangerous training. Unfortunately, she had to sacrifice herself in the process.

With Naruto including numerous filler arcs that are technically unrelated to the main story, it is no surprise that many choose to skip them. However, doing so results in missing out on plenty of original stories that were lovingly crafted by passionate people. The Star Guard Mission arc, in particular, remains one of the most memorable story arcs for those who watched it, with some going as far as to consider it not just the best filler of Naruto, but of all anime.
