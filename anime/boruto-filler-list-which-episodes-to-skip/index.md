# Boruto Filler List - Which Episodes To Skip


## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

Just like its predecessor Naruto Shippuden, Boruto is filled with many filler episodes that deviate from the main story.




The biggest gripe fans have with Boruto: Naruto Next Generations is the amount of filler it has. With a whopping 70 percent of the show containing filler episodes, the need for a guide to maneuver the manga canon and fillers is needed.




The reason Boruto: Naruto Next Generations contains so many filler episodes is that the studio adapting it needs to give the manga author time to stay ahead of the series. This is made worse because the manga releases chapters monthly as opposed to weekly.

          

Nonetheless, the series, even with filler, is still very popular and enjoyed by many. Here is a guide for all filler episodes for fans who want to stick with canon.


 Every Filler Episode Of Bleach 
 Episode/Arc Title  Episode #   Academy Entrance Arc  2-17   School Trip Arc  25-38   Genin Mission Arc  40-52   Byakuya Gang Arc  43-52   Chocho Arc  67-71   Mitsukiâ€™s Disappearance  72-92   Curse Mark Arc  98-105   Konohamaru&#39;s Love  116-119   One Tail Escort  120-126   Time Slip  128-136   The Funato War  232-255   Kawaki Goes Undercover  256-273   Labyrinth Games  274-281   






There are a total of 206 filler episodes in Boruto: Naruto Next Generation which is more than any other series. Studio Pierrot is notorious for introducing side stories not present in the manga, like in the case of Black Clover and Naruto Shippuden. As previously mentioned, fillers are used mainly to give the author some breathing room and time to put out more chapters. Studio Pierrot produces year-round episodes, so it makes sense why they&#39;re always catching up to the source material. When the source material is fully present like in the case of Bleach Thousand Year Blood War, there are zero filler episodes present and the manga is faithfully adapted.



 Are Any Of Boruto&#39;s Arcs Worth Watching? 
          

Contrary to popular narrative, Boruto does have fillers worth giving a chance. Despite most of the episodes being filler, the series is one of the most successful anime and has generated a lot of money and spin-offs and games. The most obvious one is the Mitsuki&#39;s Disappearance Arc. Mitsuki has always been a fan favorite but didn&#39;t get a backstory in the manga. The arc featured one of the best fights in the series between Orochimaru and Log. Another arc worth watching is the Time Slip arc where Sasuke and Boruto go back in time and meet the young Naruto cast and Jiraiya.




                  25 Best Episodes Of Naruto Shippuden, Ranked   Naruto Shippuden had tons of quality episodes, but how do they rank, overall? These are the best episodes of the series for your next binge-watch.   

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations is almost entirely filler, and is ridiculed for that. However, the series is very enjoyable, and the fillers entertain fans while the author is working hard to put out more chapters. The fillers don&#39;t affect the series at all as it&#39;s very easy to skip them and pretend like they never exist. The anime does a great job of expanding on characters who are ignored, and that has usually enhanced the show when those characters appear in the manga episodes. From foreshadowing new abilities to introducing the Jougan, the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime should be given a chance.
