## Literature Review

While there are few anime based on traditional books instead of manga or light novels, they are some of the best shows and movies in the medium.




Successful anime adaptations can be inspired by a variety of sources but one of the rarest is from a regular novel. There are many reasons for this including the fact that the existing art of a manga gives animators a template from which to craft their work. However, it also comes from the fact that novels can often be a lot more psychologically complex than a typical manga or light novel.
Before diving into the list, it is important to clear up a source of confusion regarding novels and light novels. Light novels are a unique type of book in Japan that are often much shorter than a regular book. They also often include illustrations of the characters or of important scenes. While these are technically novels, they are often treated as being different from the standard definition of the word. Thus for this list anime based on light novels like the Monogatari series or any number of isekai series will be excluded. This list will also not include anime that serve as a retelling of the general tale in a different setting like the futuristic Count of Monte Cristo story Gankutsuou. With those provisos out of the way, here are the ten best anime based on novels.









 








 10  Anne of Green Gables 
        

Anne of Green Gables is an old anime based on an old book, but that doesn&#39;t make this timeless tale any less great. Adapting the Anne of Green Gables novels by L. M. Montgomery, the anime of the same name is a perfect introduction to a series beloved around the world. The animation can be a bit dated at times and the show isn&#39;t as action-packed as many of the most popular anime currently airing, but Anne of Green Gables is still a heartwarming watch that will delight both newcomers and existing fans alike.





 9  The Great Passage 
        

The Great Passage follows an eclectic group of characters attempting to make a comprehensive dictionary of the Japanese language. While this is a perfect concept for the novel of the same name by Shion Miura, as an anime it sounds like it would be a tougher sell. However, seeing the characters come to life in the adaptation just makes them more lovable and their fascinating exploration of obscure words and the finer points of making a dictionary isn&#39;t hampered by the change in medium. While this series may be a bit niche compared to the others on this list, it is still a fun tale about a fascinating subject.





 8  Legend of the Galactic Heroes 
        

Based on the novel series of the same name by author Yoshiki Tanaka, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is easily the most epic anime on this list. For over 100 episodes it chronicles the conflict between two star-spanning countries, the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance. Each side of the war is told through the lens of various characters, but the main two are the Empire&#39;s Reinhard von Lohengramm and the Alliance&#39;s Yang Wen-li. While the series is long as its original version has some outdated animation, it is still incredibly good and worth a watch for fans of space operas.





 7  Welcome to the N.H.K. 
        

While it may have some slight differences from the novel it is based on, Welcome to the N.H.K. is still a great anime that is often overlooked in the modern day. Based on the novel of the same name by Tatsuhiko Takimoto, the series follows the shut-in Sato who meets a girl determined to break him out of his introverted lifestyle. The show is a great psychological examination of all manner of shut-ins and can be both funny and tragic in equal measure. While the anime did cut out some of the more risquÃ© aspects of the book, it is equally incisive and insightful as its source material and still a great watch for fans of more character-driven anime.





 6  Hyouka 
        

Hyouka is an anime adapting many of the novels in the Classic Literature Club mystery series by Honobu Yonezawa. It follows a lazy high school student Oreki who is forced to join the classical literature club at his high school and then further forced into solving various mysteries that arise around the school. While he may be lazy, Oreki soon proves he is a better detective than even Conan. While this mixture of slice of life and mystery may not appeal to some fans, Hyouka is still a beautiful show with charming and entertaining characters that make it a joy to watch.





 5  From the New World 
        

From the New World is a fascinating science fiction story showing what the future of humanity may be like if they developed psychic powers. Based on the novel by Yusuke Kishi, it follows a group of young friends in a small village as they grow up and discover many dark secrets their society has been hiding. While the show&#39;s premise is compelling enough, where it really shines is in its characters. All the children go through great growth arcs and the main antagonist of the series is one of the most compelling in all anime. From the New World is a sci-fi gem that more people need to watch.





 4  Tatami Galaxy 
        

Tatami Galaxy is easily the trickiest show on this list. Based on the novel by Tomihiko Morimi, it follows an unnamed college student as he explores the different paths he could have taken through his university life. The show is beautifully animated and incredibly witty, frequently featuring fast-paced and clever wordplay. An unabashedly absurdist show, it nonetheless manages to masterfully explore the human condition through its conceit and the various characters the protagonist encounters. While this is easily one of the toughest entries on this list to engage with, viewers who do will be greatly rewarded.





 3  Perfect Blue 
        

Perfect Blue was the legendary Satoshi Kon&#39;s directorial debut, but it is excellent enough to be the masterwork of any other director. Based on the novel Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, the movie follows the mental breakdown of the idol/actress Mima Kirigoe. The terrifying nature of her downward spiral combined with the gruesome murders that occur as it happens makes this movie one of the most terrifying anime ever made and also serves as a powerful commentary on society&#39;s obsession with celebrities. It is arguably Kon&#39;s best work, although many fans would give that title to another movie on this list.





 2  Paprika 
        

Paprika was the last movie that Satoshi Kon directed before his tragic death. The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Yasutaka Tsutsui. It follows a psychologist who enters a dream world to battle a terrorist who threatens to plunge the world into nightmares. It is a trippy masterpiece of animation that explores the nature of dreams and humanity&#39;s ever-changing relationship with technology. It even went on to inspire Hollywood blockbusters like Inception. While it may not be as terrifying as Perfect Blue, it is much more enigmatic and thought-provoking and is a worthy final film for Kon to have tragically ended his career on.





 1  Howl&#39;s Moving Castle 
        

Studio Ghibli seems to be in a league of its own when it comes to creating beautiful anime movies, and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle just serves as more proof. The movie is based on Diana Wynn Jones&#39; novel of the same name, although it makes some significant changes to its source material. The movie follows a girl Sophie who is transformed into an old woman by an evil witch and then encounters a wizard named Howl who helps her break out of her curse. This may sound relatively simple compared to the much more cryptic plot and imagery of Spirited Away, but this simplicity works in the film&#39;s favor and some fans actually think Howl&#39;s Moving Castle is the best Ghibli film, a testament to its high quality.
While the anime on this list spanned a wide variety of genres and themes, most of them featured a much deeper exploration of their characters than other series. This is likely a consequence of the nature of their source medium being able to explore the inner lives of its characters more easily. Thus, these 10 best anime based on novels can provide general insights into that sort of adaptation in general.
