## Literature Review

Both on HIDIVE, Phantom of the Idol is much less popular than Oshi no Ko, but it is clearly much less scattered and more effectively balanced.




HIDIVE is mostly known for hosting the critically acclaimed series Oshi no Ko, but very few fans are aware that the anime streaming platform licenses a newer title also about the idol industry called Phantom of the Idol. And while Oshi no Ko is popular for a reason, Phantom of the Idol deserves much more recognition than it currently enjoys.




Oshi no Ko and Phantom of the Idol are similar because they both use supernatural phenomena such as reincarnation and ghost possessions, respectively, to explore the intricacies of the idol industry. However, that&#39;s where all similarities end, as both series vary greatly in tone and direction.

          

On the surface, Phantom of the Idol&#39;s initial shock factor is the series&#39; decision to focus on male idols. Phantom of the Idol sees the ghost of a female idol possess a male who isn&#39;t particularly interested in being an idol. The series explores the gender dynamic between its leads by explaining the difficulty of a woman trying to perform in a man&#39;s body.


 Phantom of the Idol Explores Idol Culture in a Different Way Than Oshi no Ko 
          




Though Oshi no Ko is ostensibly a critical take on the idol industry, the overall mechanics of the profession are lost among the series&#39; exploration of the wider entertainment industry. Ruby&#39;s experiences might follow the idol aspect of the series, but Oshi no Ko often gets sidetracked by Aqua&#39;s storyline as he navigates other roles in entertainment to find out his mother&#39;s killer. By comparison, Phantom of the Idol&#39;s primary focus is on being an idol - which is portrayed through the differing experiences of Yuyu Niyodo and Asahi Mogami.

While Phantom of the Idol is much more upbeat, what it and Oshi no Ko share in tone is a sense of loss that their respective characters try to reclaim. In the case of Oshi no Ko&#39;s Ruby, and her former identity as Serena, her dream of being an idol is far removed from the profession as opposed to the Phantom of the Idol&#39;s Mogami. As Ruby, she wants to be an idol like her mother Ai was. As Serena, she wants to be an idol because Ai represented her hopes and aspirations. Although touching, Mogami&#39;s sense of loss is more complete. She was literally living out her dream as an idol before it was stripped away upon her untimely death. Even though she does live out that dream through her unique relationship with the living idol Niyodo, it still isn&#39;t the same.






 Dark Versus Light 
          

Phantom of the Idol diverges from Oshi no Ko for the better through Niyodo and Mogami&#39;s connection. Even though there are those who would prefer Oshi no Ko&#39;s darker take, Phantom of the Idol balances both the positives and negatives. It captures the bittersweet nature of Mogami&#39;s situation while still conveying the joys and passions that idols who truly love their profession share.

The key to Phantom of the Idol is how Niyodo and Mogami&#39;s odd relationship grows, effectively demonstrating how a person&#39;s passion can help ignite the same passion in others. It is this central adoration of idol culture that makes HIDIVE&#39;s Phantom of the Idol a much better representative of idol anime than Oshi no Ko. 

Season 1 of Phantom of the Idol is streaming on HIDIVE!
