 9  Step Up Is Surprisingly Catchy For A Background Song 
Soul Eater
        

Another great workout song from the pairing of Taku Iwasaki and Lotus Juice is “Step Up” from Soul Eater.

The fact that Justin listens to it in every scene he’s in gives a lot of credence to it being a great song to listen to, and as such, it would be a welcome addition to anyone’s workout playlist.





 8  Now Or Never Added Incredible Energy To A Classic Anime 
Astro Boy
        

Another great anime rap song to listen to while working out is “Now or Never” from the 2003 Astro Boy anime.

Naturally, that means listening to “Now or Never” is bound to put anyone in a good mood, Astro Boy fan or not, and that makes it a great song to listen to during one’s workout.
