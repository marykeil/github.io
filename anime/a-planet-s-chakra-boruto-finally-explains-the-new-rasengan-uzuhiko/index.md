## Literature Review

Boruto&#39;s new Rasengan&#39;s powers were heavily debated but chapter 3 explained its power, and it is shocking.





In chapter 2, Boruto unleashed a new type of Rasengan called Uzuhiko. There was a lot of speculation about its powers, but chapter 3 revealed the new version of the deadly jutsu, which is beyond what anyone imagined.




          

Rasengan Uzuhiko works under the same premise of chakra spinning, but Boruto incorporated the Earth&#39;s spinning chakra which completely disorients an opponent and interferes with their balance. Boruto attacked Code with this technique, and Code couldn&#39;t stand straight no matter what happened. This is reminiscent of Shinji Hirako&#39;s Bankai in Bleach which messes with an opponent&#39;s center of gravity. What makes Boruto&#39;s technique so deadly though is that it&#39;s also an attack with some serious power behind it, as evidenced by the toll it takes on Code.

                  Boruto Part 2 Is Already Leaving One Of Its Main Characters Behind   Kawaki became the main villain at the end of Boruto but he seems to have already lost all his relevance in Two Blue Vortex, where he shows no growth.   





 Boruto&#39;s Rasengan Uzuhiko is a Death Sentence For its Victims 
          

As Boruto explains, the way that Uzuhiko works is that it utilizes Earth&#39;s ever-spinning chakra and infuses it in into an opponent. This imbued chakra runs wild in a person&#39;s body, and they become dizzy, unable to discern right from left or up and down. Their equilibrium is completely destroyed, and they will not be able to stand much less fight. These devastating effects almost guarantee victory for Boruto, as he is free to do whatever to the opponent who can&#39;t see straight. This technique is even wilder than the speculated version of Boruto&#39;s new Rasengan that combines the Chidori and Hyuga Clan&#39;s technique.

By utilizing the Earth&#39;s spin and directing it onto an opponent, Boruto has just established himself as one of the most powerful ninjas. Code tried multiple times to attack him, but he couldn&#39;t even come close as his vision was impaired. Furthermore, the spinning chakra will continue to damage the opponent and kill him off gradually. The only way to avoid certain death is if the Earth stops spinning - which is impossible - or until Boruto deactivates the technique. It is safe to say that it is game over for a victim of the Uzuhiko. They cannot stop the planet&#39;s rotation nor can they kill Boruto in their state.






 Rasengan Uzuhiko Is Extremely Overpowered 
          

What makes Uzuhiko even more frightening is that Boruto isn&#39;t using his own chakra - he is absorbing the Earth&#39;s chakra and then redirecting it onto an opponent. The fact that such an incredible technique doesn&#39;t drain the user of their chakra means that Boruto is free to use it as many times as he wants without exhausting his energy. With an unlimited supply of chakra from the Earth and the speed to make the attack land, Boruto&#39;s new weapon is one of anime&#39;s strongest. There are still a lot of questions to be answered, but it&#39;s confirmed that Boruto&#39;s Rasengan Uzuhiko is one of the series&#39; most deadly jutsus of all time.

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is available to read on Manga Plus.
