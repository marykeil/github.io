 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #29? 
          




Pokémon Horizons episode #29 saw the airship crew track down the Poké Ball artisan they were told about in the previous episode, while the ship&#39;s mechanic, Orla, dealt with a variety of minor disasters aboard ship. Orla goes with Friede, Liko, and Roy to meet this Poké Ball artisan, who turns out to be treating her own mass production machines rather roughly, prompting Orla to give them a tune-up. Orla and the Poké Ball artisan grow closer, and she asks if Orla might stay with her. While Orla briefly considers it, Roy gets into trouble with a Galarian Weezing, and the team must fend off the attackers with Friede&#39;s help. Orla is reminded why she likes being aboard the airship, and decides to stay.



 Pokémon Horizons Episode #30 Sees Spooky Phenomena Aboard the Airship 
          

The preview for episode #30 shows the airship being haunted by a Polteageist, a Pokémon from the Galar region that resides inside an antique tea kettle. The mystery of what Pokémon is causing them so many problems won&#39;t be quite so easy for the characters to solve, however, as this Polteageist is a slippery character--both literally and metaphorically, as it spills the liquid in its body on the floor to trip those giving chase. It&#39;s not clear from the preview what this Polteageist might want, as it could be after something in particular, or simply another Ghost-type Pokémon playing pranks on the crew for fun.




The airship&#39;s current destination remains a mystery for now; they may still be remaining in the Galar region for some time, or it could finally be time to set sail and seek out the next region where one of the Ancient Adventurer Lucius&#39;s Pokémon may be waiting. While the Galar region has had plenty of excitement and new sights to offer, some fans are beginning to grow a bit bored with the location, so it may be time for the airship and its crew to head off on the next leg of their journey. Upcoming episode titles suggest their next target will be Lucius&#39;s Lapras, but where exactly Lapras is stands as a mystery for now. Pokémon Horizons seems to be set to get back on track with the plot after the next episode, so fans may finally get their change of pace from Galar.
