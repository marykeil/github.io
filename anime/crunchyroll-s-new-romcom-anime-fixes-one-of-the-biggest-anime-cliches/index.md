## Literature Review

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You has finally premiered, and it fixes one of the biggest anime clichés.





Harems are definitely a major cliché in anime, but The 100 Girlfriends is already doing a lot to fix it through parody. As the title would imply, 100 Girlfriends is also a harem anime, and unlike other anime, the harem aspect, rather than just being an add-on to the story, is what the anime explicitly revolves around. Even with that, however, it manages to fix the biggest problems with the genre, and it all stems from one vital change it makes to the basic premise: it follows through on it.





 100 Girlfriends Fixes Harem Anime By Actually Following Through On Its Premise 
          

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You fixes the harem anime cliché in one simple way: by actually following through on it. The story of 100 Girlfriends revolves around protagonist Rentaro Aijo who, after being romantically rejected 100 times, is rewarded by the God of Love in a rather complicated way: he will encounter 100 soulmates throughout high school, and he has to date every of them or they’ll die a tragic death. Episode #1 ends with him entering a relationship with his first two soulmates - Hakari Hanazono and Karane Inda - with the promise of 98 more to come, so it’s clear that 100 Girlfriends is a step above other harem anime by actually committing to the bit.

                  What&#39;s New On Crunchyroll In Fall 2023   The Fall 2023 season of anime is about to start, and here are all the new anime people can expect to watch on Crunchyroll throughout the season.   




The best part about The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You following through on its harem plot is how natural it’s all made out to be. Whereas most harems have flimsy reasons for why the characters are attracted to one another, 100 Girlfriends establishes genuine chemistry between Rentaro, Hakari, and Karane, and the lengths to which Rentaro goes to show his affection make it clear that people can expect a protagonist who truly earns having so many girls love him. It’s far more work than other anime put into their harems, and it’s great to see an anime try and fix some of the genre’s problems.



 100 Girlfriends Is The Perfect Product Of The New Romance Anime Trends 
          

Another takeaway from The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You committing to the harem element is that it makes it the perfect product of the new trends of romance anime. In recent years, it’s become more common for anime to get to their romance as soon as possible, or even start with it, with Bloom Into You and Kaguya-sama: Love is War being notable examples. Not only does 100 Girlfriends follow that same idea, but it does so with a harem, one of the biggest symbols of old anime tropes, so it can be seen as the ultimate representation of how much romance anime has changed.

This idea, of course, is best exemplified through the characters. In addition to how much work is done to perfectly justify why Rentaro would have girls be attracted to him, as later volumes of the manga show, the girls are all given character arcs and personalities completely independent of their feelings for Rentaro, something that harem anime far too often fail to do. It’s something that perfectly goes along with The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You’s attempts at fixing the clichés of the harem genre, and it will be great to see it play out in the upcoming weeks on Crunchyroll.

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You releases new episodes Sundays on Crunchyroll.
