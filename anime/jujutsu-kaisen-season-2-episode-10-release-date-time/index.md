## Literature Review

In Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #10, Gojo&#39;s allies must fight the Disaster Curses without the aid of one of the most powerful characters.

Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #10 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, September 28. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on September 28 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 12 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #9? 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s season 2 episode #9 focused on Gojo&#39;s battle with the Disaster Curses in the Shibuya station. Initially, he seemed to be doing very well, quickly killing Hanami while keeping bystander casualties rather low. However, once Mahito showed up with a train load of transfigured humans, he had to quickly figure out how to save people from them as the rate of carnage rapidly increased. He did this by briefly opening his Domain expansion and then killing all the transfigured humans while everyone was stunned. However, this left him vulnerable, and the sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body was able to appear and seal him in the prison realm.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #10 Will Focus on the Fallout of Gojo&#39;s Sealing 
          

With Gojo now out of the fighting for the foreseeable future, the other sorcerers will have to defeat Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s remaining villains like Jogo and Mahito. Given that Mechamaru has somehow alerted Yuji to Gojo&#39;s sealing, they at least will be somewhat aware of the situation in Shibuya and thus not walk into a trap. However, even with this advance notice, they may not be able to match the raw strength and power of the Curses. This also isn&#39;t even factoring in any other surprises the sorcerer possessing Geto might have prepared for them, especially given it seems they have access to the Special Grade sorcerer&#39;s curse manipulation technique.

All of this means that Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s latest arc is about to get a lot more extreme and dangerous for its heroes. While the arc had been good before this point, this new sense of stakes will likely make it even better, hopefully allowing the arc to meet or surpass the high expectations fans have placed on it. Episode #10 will be a good indication of whether Jujutsu Kaisen will be better due to Gojo&#39;s sealing or if the show will falter without its most powerful character.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #10 when it airs on Crunchyroll on September 28, 2023.
