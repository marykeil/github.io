## Literature Review

Goblin Slayer is back for its second season, and the team continues its quest for a new adventure, but will a newcomer lead them to more danger?




Back for its second season, Crunchyroll&#39;s Goblin Slayer starts out where it left off at the end of its first season, namely with its intense depictions of violence, but that its fans have come to expect. It&#39;s also just as contentious as the last season – although, the controversies surrounding the series&#39; comeback are different from the original discussions surrounding the dark fantasy anime.




Goblin Slayer, which adapts the Kumo Kagyu series of light novels of the same name, follows Goblin Slayer – a sort of knight errant who has dedicated his life to ridding the world of goblins. In the story, goblins are portrayed in graphic detail as a race of beings who rape and slaughter anyone outside their species. Fighting fire with fire, Goblin Slayer tears into goblins with a degree of hatred and viciousness unparalleled by even some of the more controversial figures in anime. Along with the titular Goblin Slayer is a team of adventurers including Priestess, a young and inexperienced adventurer who almost died on her first mission, but was rescued by Goblin Slayer.

                  Berserk Fans Wanting More Gory Action Need to Read Its True Successor   Fans of dark fantasy stories who will miss Kentaro Miura&#39;s masterpiece, Berserk, should check out the grim and gory manga Goblin Slayer.   


 Goblin Slayer&#39;s Team Adds A New Player 
          




Goblin Slayer season 2, which premiered on October 6, 2023, finds the team ready for a new adventure. Instead of being considered a handicap, Priestess is seen by the team as an integral member, albeit one who still lacks experience. Fortunately, there are new associates on the team who are less experienced than her, including the Young Wizard. After the elder member&#39;s warnings are ignored by Young Wizard, Priestess is tasked with mentoring him through the trials and tribulations of goblin hunting.

While the episode is rather mild compared to the first season, it still contains plenty of dark content. There&#39;s still gratuitous violence and fan service that more than a few viewers will find inappropriate. Nevertheless, Goblin Slayer has developed a large fandom who believe its depravity is one of the elements of the story that make it unique and worthy of watching. This isn&#39;t to say that it should be condoned but that some fans find it legitimate in terms of the story. Completely limiting these aspects of the anime will certainly affect continuing support. Still, the series has seemingly toned itself down – for now.






 Goblin Slayer&#39;s New Controversy 
          

Goblin Slayer was released with controversy and returned with controversy, though not of the same variety as before. The controversy this time around is whether Goblin Slayer – for the sake of its own longevity – will continue with its former formula, or if it will continue to reign itself in. The first episode of the second season seems to be running through that analysis. It gives both sides of the issue hope that they will eventually prevail.
