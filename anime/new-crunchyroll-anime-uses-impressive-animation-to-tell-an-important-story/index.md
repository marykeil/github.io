## Literature Review

The upcoming anime adaptation of A Sign Of Affection by Ajia-do unveiled a gorgeous trailer that displayed how much love is going into the series.





A brand-new trailer for A Sign of Affection dropped on October 20, 2023, unveiling the staff behind the upcoming anime, as well as a unique detail that has fans of the original series more excited than ever. In the trailer, it&#39;s revealed that Ajia-do has put together a team of animators dedicated to animating the sign language seen throughout the series. This is gorgeously showcased in the conversations between Yuki and Itsuomi in the trailer, as well as showcasing other key characters communicating with Yuki.





 A Sign Of Affection Is A Winter 2024 Must-Watch 

 

As documented by Twitter user @Yuyucow in a tweet praising the effort put into A Sign of Affection, this exclusive animation team is made up of Ajia-do veterans, including the likes of Yoshiaki Yanagida (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Jin-Roh), Masaya Fujimori (Revenger, Fairy Tail: Priestess of the Phoenix), and Yuki Miyamoto (How NOT To Summon a Demon Lord, Doraemon Nobita no Takarajima). Additionally, the anime will be directed by Yuuta Murano, who&#39;s previously directed Kakushigoto, and has worked on episode storyboards for Dragon Ball Super and Kamisama Kiss.

          




The level of care and detail being put into the anime adaptation of A Sign of Affection is nothing short of astounding, and many fans of the original manga, as well as diehard shojo fans have been signaling for the anime community to commend and support this level of effort once the series begins airing. Additionally, the reception to the efforts being made to properly animate the sign language seen in A Sign of Affection speaks to how badly shojo anime fans want high quality adaptations of series within the demographic. After the successful releases of My Happy Marriage and My Love Story With Yamada-kun at Lv.999, its apparent that the demand for high quality shojo is more sought after than ever.

A Sign of Affection will begin streaming on Crunchyroll during the Winter 2024 anime season.
