# Inhumans Fanart Makes Marvel s Most Unique Superpower Look Real


## SUMMARY 



  Medusa&#39;s unique ability to use her long and luxurious hair as a weapon is brilliantly showcased in BossLogic&#39;s fan art.   The Inhumans, a society of superhumans with diverse powers, were given a big push by Marvel in the 2010s but their live-action adaptation fell short.   BossLogic&#39;s artwork honors the creative brilliance of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee by beautifully highlighting Medusa&#39;s dangerous and cool abilities.

## Literature Review

The Inhumans&#39; Medusa has one of Marvel&#39;s most unique powers, and now artist BossLogic has brought it to spectacular life.




A new piece of Inhumans fan art makes one of Marvel’s most unique superpowers look real. The Inhumans are one of Marvel’s oldest teams, and also one of its most powerful. Their powers are diverse, such as Black Bolt’s ability to level an entire city with a whisper. However, there is one member of the Inhumans who has one of the oddest powers in the Marvel Universe: Medusa, and now acclaimed artist BossLogic gives an awesome spin on her abilities.




BossLogic unveiled the piece in a post on Instagram. Calling it a “Medusa rework,” BossLogic stated he wanted to go “way extra” with her hair. BossLogic’s piece shows Medusa facing the viewer, a defiant look on her face. Her red hair, which is her primary weapon, is seemingly going wild.


 

Medusa is not deterred, and is firmly in charge of her abilities.


 The Inhumans Are A Unique Super Team 
          

Medusa is but one of the Inhumans, a society of superhumans who once resided in the Blue Area of the Moon. Centuries ago, the Kree experimented on humans, exposing them to the Terragen Mists, which gave them fantastic powers. Each individual Inhuman is subjected to the Mists as adolescents, and each gets their own ability. The Inhumans’ Royal Family, of which Medusa is a member of, includes the aforementioned Black Bolt as well as Gorgon and Karnak. Medusa, as the name implies, uses her long and luxurious hair as a weapon. No one else in the Marvel Universe does this, making Medusa a unique character.




In the 2010s, Marvel gave the Inhumans a massive push, awarding them multiple titles and a vaunted position in its universe. The Inhumans’ resurgence also led to a live-action adaptation. Originally intended to be an MCU movie, it was later reworked into a limited series. While the concept is undeniably cool, it did not translate well to the screen, and the series was a dud both critically and commercially. Part of the criticism leveled at the show was the effects, and indeed, showing some of their powers, such as Medusa’s, takes a suspension of disbelief that some fans were unwilling to do.

                  X-Men and Inhumans Have Finally Made Peace After Their Historic Battle   With Fox and Disney settling their legal battle, the X-Men and the Inhumans finally make peace in Marvel Comics - thanks to the power of lawyers.   



 The Inhumans Deserved Far Better 
          




Now, BossLogic has come along and shown the MCU, and the rest of the comics field, how to properly display Medusa’s powers. Using hair as a weapon may seem far-fetched, but in the hands of generations of creators such as Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, it worked beautifully. BossLogic’s new piece honors Lee and Kirby’s epic creation, showing her abilities as dangerous and cool. While Medusa and the Inhumans may not have set the screen on fire, BossLogic has created a superb piece of fan art that showcases this unique ability.
