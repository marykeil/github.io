                  The Boy and the Heron Review: Ghibli&#39;s Best Movie in Years is Finally Here   The Boy and the Heron is the long-awaited new film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and it stands out as one of their best projects in years.   


 The Future Is Bright For Studio Ghibli 
          




2023 was an exceptional year for Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, releasing the highly anticipated The Boy and the Heron, which took 7 years to produce. The movie broke records, both in Japan and globally. Garnering more than $120 million, the movie was the highest-grossing movie in North America during its opening weekend, was nominated for two Golden Globes for the first time alongside Suzume, and was shortlisted for an Oscar nomination. The movie went on to shatter many other records, solidifying itself as one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s best and most successful movies ever.



“To everyone,
We would like to express our sincere New Year’s greetings.
Thank you for always supporting Studio Ghibli.
Last July, for the first time in 10 years, we released a new film, The Boy and the Heron, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and since then many audiences have viewed it. The production period lasted seven years, during which time major incidents such as wars and the pandemic continued, but we are very proud to have completed the movie for people all over the world to watch. It will continue to be screened over New Year’s, so we would be happy if you could visit movie theatres to watch it.
In addition, Ghibli Park has been opening sequentially since the year before last in Nagakute City, Aichi Prefecture, and once the Witch’s Valley opens in March, all areas will be complete. This is a project led by Director Goro Miyazaki, who has been promoting it for seven years since the concept was announced. We hope you can spare some time to come and see it.
In 2024, work at Studio Ghibli will begin on Friday, 5 January. On this day, Director Hayao Miyazaki will celebrate his 83rd birthday, and we are very happy that he is still working in the studio.
Thank you for your continued support of Studio Ghibli and Studio Ghibli’s films this year.
1.1.2024.”






In addition to the movie, a Studio Ghibli amusement park was also built and was opened at the end of 2022. Featuring theme areas based on Studio Ghibli&#39;s many iconic movies, such as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, the theme park is a show of the studio&#39;s success over the years, as very few franchises have a dedicated park for them. The heartfelt message concluded by saying that the studio led by Miyazaki will return to work on January 5, following his 83rd birthday. It was rumored that The Boy and the Heron would be the director&#39;s final film, but it seems that his dedication to his craft has made him resume his activities.

It has been barely 2 months since the international release of the movie, and it has surpassed everyone&#39;s expectations. From the nostalgic animation to the ethereal music that was nominated for 2 major awards, The Boy and the Heron is a declaration that in an age of 3-D and CGI movies, 2-D animation will forever remain timeless. Fans are obviously ecstatic that Hayao Miyazaki will continue working his magic as he leads Studio Ghibli to more iconic and record-shattering movies.
