## Literature Review

Whether they have a fantastic soundtrack, look like an album cover, or bear the right attitude, these anime have what metal enthusiasts need.





There are many ways to be metal enough for genre enthusiasts to take an interest. Besides getting the right band on board, this selection also has suitably gritty tales, extreme visuals, or just simply has characters putting in the right guitar work. Either way, metal fans have a breadth and variety of hard-edged shows they can appreciate when they want both a visual and an audio experience to get their adrenaline pumping.
            
 
 10 Best Anime EDs of the 2010s 
The best anime endings of the 2010s are memorable for their eye-catching visuals, the strong feelings they evoke, and incredible music numbers.












 








 10  Berserk 
        

This seminal dark fantasy is a classic for a reason, with gorgeous art bringing panel after panel of stylized armor, towering castles, dark forests, deep seas, and a variety of monsters that turn Guts&#39;s journey of revenge into a Symphonic Power Metal album come to life. Once the visual draws readers in, the epic quest that has spanned years both in and out of the story will keep them there to follow the Black Swordsman in his various battles that only lack an electric guitar accompaniment to emphasize the sheer bloodiness of the chaotic supernatural sword fights he gets into.
            
 
 10 Best Berserk Scenes Which Still Haven&#39;t Been Adapted Yet 
With less than a third of the Berserk manga already adapted, there are still plenty of memorable scenes that deserve an adaptation.








 9  Demon City Shinjuku 
        

Yoshiaki Kawajiri directed some of the moodiest anime films of the 80s. While his other works tend towards cyberpunk noir, gothic horror, or feudal fantasy, Shinjuku is gritty in a way metalheads would enjoy. The demon-infested quarantine zone is filled with cracked concrete, fog, and muddy lighting, while the monsters are suitably grotesque. There is a rawness to the urban decay that is without glamor or elaboration that makes Kyouya&#39;s battle against evil delightfully visceral. While Kawajiri&#39;s other works are certainly also violent and relentless, their stylizations and genres add flavor in a way Demon City Shinjuku does not require.





 8  FLCL 
        

Despite its happy-go-lucky atmosphere, FLCL is all about rebellion against everything. Insane visuals, shifting mediums, and none-too-subtle sexual innuendos litter this coming-of-age story designed to bewilder and defy common sense. Through it all, Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll provides a consistent lifeline to hang onto through the chaos, be it through electric guitars serving as weapons, or the band The Pillows providing the soundtrack for the original six-episode show the sequel FLCL Grunge, and growling battle music just for any doubters of Alt-Rock. Naota&#39;s journey out of childhood remains one of the most beloved anime today, all thanks to its guitars and basses.





 7  Bastard!! 
        

This anime is subtitled &#34;Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy&#34; in English for good reason. If nothing else, Bastard!!&#39;s author loved the music genre enough to drop references everywhere in this over-the-top 80s fantasy that verges on self-parody. When the all-powerful wizard Dark Schneider is out to conquer the world and any overly voluptuous women, while fighting for the Kingdom of Metallicana to stop the demon Anthrasax, it is clear the anime&#39;s only goal is just to have a good time. While the anime already had a 1998 OVA, Bastard!! had a resurgence thanks to a two-season remake hosted on Netflix.





 6  Death Note 
        

This story&#39;s animated adaptation was likely many a fan&#39;s first introduction to Maximum the Hormone, who provided the music for the anime&#39;s opening credits. Past that is a world of death and murder, with memorably macabre designs for the setting&#39;s shinigami, and stellar visuals that make the hunt for a magic-wielding serial killer a joy to behold in its excess. Every scene is played to maximum drama, and every action is undertaken with the most flourish. Even the ostensibly foreign characters bear names so absurd they seem better fit as stage titles. Like metal, Death Note is hard to ignore.





 5  Black Lagoon 
        

If Mötley Crüe&#39;s Welcome to the Jungle had a physical incarnation, it would be the fictional Thai city of Roanapur Black Lagoon revolves around, when hapless salaryman Rokuro Okajima finds himself stranded there before deciding to take up modern-day piracy. Every adventure is filled with high-flying adventure and bloody combat against a series of increasingly ridiculous foes who nonetheless never fail to make jaws drop from the action. Whether a Yakuza slices a bullet in half, or an ex-guerilla maid clings to the back of a speeding car, viewers can only come away realizing how metal each new episode is.





 4  Chainsaw Man 
        

As its title implies, Chainsaw Man is a superhero story skewed in all the ways black comedy can muster, as an orphan gains demonic powers and chooses to fight invaders from Hell to gain food, women, and attention. The world is both bleak yet incredibly imaginative in terms of monster design, and MAPPA&#39;s animated adaptation does it justice with its decision to draw everything with realism in mind, which only emphasizes the insanity on display as Denji battles creatures fit for album covers. Meanwhile, the anime&#39;s ending songs are provided by bands like Vaundy, Maximum the Hormone, and People 1.





 3  Beck 
        

Anime like Bocchi the Rock or K-On! tend to take a local or hobbyist look at music bands. Beck, on the other hand, follows the long, arduous path necessary to become an international sensation. Rock music is serious business, ranging from the author&#39;s obvious love of the Red Hot Chili Peppers to the anime&#39;s climatic rendition of a Beatles song. The English dub is also celebrated, with the localization team not only getting voice talents who could sing but even locating series-accurate instruments in order to rerecord the music when necessary. Beck is nothing but a celebration of rock music.





 2  Fist of the North Star 
        

This anime is an institution in Japan, as it proved martial arts epics had no limit, and could even turn up in a retro-fit Mad Max-esque setting. Fist of the North Star always aims for maximum shock and awe: bare-chested, mohawk-wearing thugs explode with a touch, tanks are punched to pieces, and elephant-sized horses trample on victims. All the while, Kenshiro cries rivers of tears while meting out bloody vigilante justice with his Hokuto Shinken style. This is truly an epic anime that goes big in everything it does, including its rock ballad opening, which fits perfectly with Metal&#39;s larger-than-life attitude.





 1  DMC: Detroit Metal City 
        

While it may play heavy metal for crass laughs and vulgar jokes, DMC is the only anime where a death metal band comprises the main characters. The theatricality of death metal concerts and its subculture serves as the source of the comedy here, as Soichi, stuck paying the bills by performing as the ghoulish &#34;Johannes Krauser II&#34;, finds his despised stage persona growing ever more popular, as fans keep buying into his &#34;demonic&#34; legend. The series received a high-effort adaptation, distilling all the jokes into neat 10-minute episodes, which is backed by an original music album that defictionalized DMC&#39;s songs.
Loud, proud, and in your face, these shows embody the nature of Heavy Metal music, either visually or aurally. Like Metal, it might scare away audiences, but they just as easily draw in those seeking them out specifically. Either way, they are all perfect compliments to the genre, mixing fantastic guitar work or insane visuals to shock and delight those seeking the same rush heavy metal albums provide. For Heavy Metal fans who worry that the anime of today doesn&#39;t have what they need, these shows prove that the medium still has what it takes to create stories with some bite.
