Fall Anime 2023 has a great lineup of anime but one stands out among its peers and could be the next big thing.

 Undead Unluck Has the Ingredients To Become a Hit 

 

Undead Unluck is an anime adaptation of the manga with the same title by Yoshifumi Tozuka. With approximately 1.5 million copies in circulation, the series was a hit and was announced to receive an adaptation by David Productions, the studio behind hits such as Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure and Fire Force. With the beautiful animation the studio is known for, the series is in great hands. The trailers for the anime also look very promising as the sound effects and animation is reminiscent of Fire Force. There are many big names working on this series and as such there are high expectations. However, what makes the anime a front-runner for the top anime of Fall 2023 is the story.

The series follows the depressed Fuuko Izumo who decides to end her own life after finishing her favorite manga. Anyone she touches has a horrific bad luck streak, typically resulting in their death, and 200 people – including her parents – have died because of her ability. Just before following through with the act, she touches a man who is then killed by an oncoming train. Miraculously, the man regenerates. The two become acquainted, and Fuuko learns that he too wishes to die. The two team up as they are targeted for their abilities by an elusive organization. The immortal man agrees works with Fuuko so that he can finally die in the most exciting way possible.




Undead Unluck is yet another action-filled series that promises to make viewers burst out laughing. The immortal man is called Andy and his wild and wacky personality has a huge effect on the anime. The show is filled with over-the-top violence like Chainsaw Man, while incorporating comedy, making it unique. COmplete with a great power system, charming characters, and an excellent story; the anime has all the makings of a show destined for success. This will be yet another show that David Productions can add to its portfolio of hits.

Undead Unluck will start airing in October 2023 and will be available exclusively on Hulu.
