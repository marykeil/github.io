## Literature Review

One Piece has revealed a much-anticipated backstory and it may be tragic enough to leave fans in furious tears.





Fans of the series had already braced themselves for the worst when the manga first teased Kuma&#39;s past in One Piece Chapter #1074 when Bonney first stumbled upon Kuma&#39;s memories. However, after the subsequent chaos on Egghead, fans suspected the reveal had been put on the back burner indefinitely, but it seems Chapter #1095 has proved fans wrong once again with the reveal of Kuma&#39;s tragic origins.




                  One Piece&#39;s Biggest Mysteries Are About To Be Explained Thanks To One Character   The reason behind Kuma&#39;s inexplicable rampage on the Holy Land as well as several of Egghead&#39;s mysteries has been hiding in plain sight for months.   


 Kuma was Enslaved as a Child with His Father 
          

Chapter #1095 reveals Kuma and his father belong to the Buccaneer race and share common blood with the Giants. Saturn reveals their race committed a grave offense against the World Government resulting in Kuma and his parents becoming enslaved after Government officials at the hospital where Kuma was born leaked the information about their true identity. Kuma&#39;s mother died shortly after while his father was killed by a Celestial Dragon for making too much noise while telling Kuma about Sun God Nika and thumping his chest to the beat of Nika&#39;s drum-like heartbeat in an attempt to cheer him up.




While losing both his parents and being enslaved by the Celestial Dragons is already tragic enough, Kuma was taken to God Valley along with other troublesome slaves to be hunted down along with the inhabitants of the island by the Celestial Dragons as part of a cruel hunting game created by the Celestial Dragons. The chapter reveals Kuma attempted to escape and came across two other slaves, one of whom is none other than Emporio Ivankov while the other is a little girl named Ginny with an appetite and appearance reminiscent of Bonney.

While it is still too early to speculate, Ginny&#39;s appearance and disposition suggest she may be Bonney&#39;s future mother. More importantly, considering this flashback takes place the same year as the infamous God Valley Incident, it is safe to assume Kuma as well as Ivankov may know the truth about what transpired on the island 38 years ago. This could not only explain why the Five Elders were so eager to have Kuma&#39;s sense of self completely erased as well as the high price on Ivankov and other Revolutionaries&#39; headsâ€”treason and rebellion aside, of course.




In all, Kuma has been one of One Piece&#39;s most mysterious characters for the longest time and his backstory has taken readers by storm as fans could have never imagined him to have such a tragic story when he was first introduced on Thriller Bark. Kuma&#39;s story like many others who were enslaved by the World Nobles highlights everything that is wrong with the world of One Piece and the cruelty of the Celestial Dragons that only grow more despicable than before with every arc. Regardless, Egghead has been exceptional in terms of exposition and fans can only hope One Piece continues to explain its biggest mysteries as the series progresses.

One Piece is available from Viz Media.
