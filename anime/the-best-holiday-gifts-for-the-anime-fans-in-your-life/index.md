 8  Umbreon Tree Ornament - $16.99 
Pokémon Center


 







Pokémon merchandise is not hard to come by as most retailers have some sort of Pokémon collectible, but this Umbreon Tree Ornament is absolutely perfect for the holidays. Umbreon is already one of the most popular &#34;Eeveelutions&#34; by far, but the addition of the holly on its head and the toy train makes this item a must-have for collectors. The ornament comes with a green ribbon to easily hang from a tree or other surface, or it can be placed as a table-top ornament thanks to its flat base.
This Umbreon ornament is not considered a toy and is made from resin, so it is not advised to allow children to play with it.

In a world where AI art is becoming the newest trend, gifting art made by an actual human is becoming more and more significant. For fans of anime and art, getting a picture of oneself drawn in an anime art style is not only a unique gift, but also a personal one. These portraits can be made in a wide variety of anime styles, can feature one or multiple people, and can even have the anime version of the individuals put onto a real-world background and vice versa.
The process of acquiring these one-of-a-kind pieces of art is relatively simple: select the preferred anime style, upload the best pictures of the person(s) to &#34;animefy&#34;, select the number of people to include in the anime portrait, choose a background, leave some notes specifying poses and other details for the artist, then wait. Once the artist has finished, an email will be sent with the pictures which can be personally printed, or a picture can be made into a framed canvas by the artist. All of this and more can be done through Animefy Me, and the portraits can actually be finished before the holidays if ordered very soon!

 1  Manga for Their Favorite Anime 
Crunchyroll
        

Rounding out the list is a gift that most anime fans have received at some point; a manga from their favorite anime. Manga is effectively a book that inspires the anime that can be seen on screen. These books are always ahead of the show, so many anime watchers will choose to read them, especially if the show has just left them on a massive cliffhanger.
Most anime lovers likely have a way to watch anime through the multitude of apps and websites available to stream anime, but there are very few websites where a person can read manga without getting spammed with ads and dealing with other unappealing factors. Plus, there is something about having a physical copy of a manga, much like a book, that just feels right to a lot of people. Check out all the available manga that Crunchyroll has to offer, and make sure to keep an eye out for discounted rates on sets of manga.
