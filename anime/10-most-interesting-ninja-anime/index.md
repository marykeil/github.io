## Literature Review

The most interesting ninja anime take the best parts of the ninja&#39;s historical roots and the dramatic elements that make an exciting anime. 




With Under Ninja currently airing, depicting hidden ninja in modern Japan, fans may want to revisit some of the best anime about ninja. These stealthy, deadly figures date back to feudal Japan, where they were used for infiltration, spying, and even assassination. For this work, they were trained in ninjutsu: the art of ensuring that one’s presence is undetectable.
In the centuries since, ninja have taken on a sensationalized image, with many variations from their historical counterparts. Mystical arts and superhuman secret techniques are very common to these stories, and often borrow the name ninjutsu, with Naruto being the easiest example. The most interesting stories skillfully combine the most dramatic elements of both.









 








 10  Naruto 
2002-2017 - Available on Crunchyroll, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Hoopla, Peacock, Roku, Pluto TV
        

Possibly the most famous anime about ninja, Naruto and Naruto Shippuden depict a shinobi world barely a decade out from its latest horrific world war. Naruto Uzumaki is just one of many young ninja of the Five Great Villages training hard to become the best. Through the show&#39;s best story arcs, he never gives up his dream of one day becoming the village’s leader and hero.
The flashy techniques, genetically inherited superpowers, and even aliens are things historical ninja could never have imagined. However, their purpose as soldiers, spies, and assassins is more in line with the original role of a ninja. Naruto’s determination to create peace in the shinobi world is severely at odds with the general purpose of a shinobi, and though he is willing to kill if necessary, he’s never actually required to do so.





 9  Nabari No Ou 
2008 - Available on Crunchyroll


Another take on ninja in the modern world, Nabari no Ou centers around the legendary secret technique Shinrabanshou. Unfortunately for apathetic Miharu Rokujou, the scroll containing it is sealed inside him. He still wouldn’t care much, but the problem is, he’s now the target of ninja clans looking to steal the Shinrabanshou by any means necessary.
Miharu grew up unaware of the ninja all around him, up to and including his teacher, classmates, and his own family. All of them are very used to living in the shadows, watching their backs constantly for enemy action, and potentially getting into kill-or-be-killed situations. While powerful techniques are important to them, they are also skilled with mundane weapons such as kunai knives.





 8  Ninja Scroll 
1993 - Available on Prime Video
        

Ninja Scroll: The Series aired in 2003 and is available on Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime Video. 

Normally, samurai served under a lord; masterless samurai were called ronin, lone warriors who wandered alone. Like ninja, ronin were considered low and dishonorable, and often resorted to mercenary work. Jubei Kibagami strives to maintain his honor even as a ronin, rejecting money to do what’s right and risking his life to protect an innocent woman.
Though Jubei is technically a samurai, a skill set most clearly displayed by his masterful swordplay, he is regularly referred to as a ninja as well. In one of the best ninja movies, he&#39;s pitted against the demonic Kimon ninja, all of whom wield supernatural powers. These, of course, are no match for Jubei’s martial arts and determination.





 7  Flame Of Recca 
1997-1998 - Available on Crunchyroll, Peacock, Roku, Tubi, Pluto TV, Freevee
        

Recca Hanabishi has always been obsessed with ninjas. He’s pretty sure that they’re even cooler than his own ability to produce flame from his right hand. But when his new friend Yanagi Sakoshita is nearly killed by a mysterious ninja, he realizes he’ll have to move on from schoolyard fights and put his all into becoming strong.
As Recca hones his martial arts skills and stokes his flame, he doesn’t just fight his way through thrilling action scenes. He discovers that he may have been born to be a ninja, descended from a powerful clan from the Sengoku period (roughly the mid-1400s to early 1600s) that were killed by Oda Nobunaga, a famous Japanese historical figure who appears in several anime.





 6  Masked Ninja Red Shadow 
1967 - Available on Plex


Red Shadow handily mixes a ninja story with the ever-popular tokusatsu genre. Japan’s Sengoku period is also known as the Warring States period for the perpetual brutal political struggles. Amid this chaos, the three ninja Akakage, Aokage, and Shirokage rise in the name of peace and justice, defending Japan from kaiju and warlords alike.
The original manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama ran from 1966 to 1967, and the anime adaptation by Toei picked right up from there, airing from 1967 to 1968. The series was popular enough to get a remake in 1987 and two live-action film adaptations in 1969 and 2001.





 5  Katanagatari 
2010 - Available on Plex


 







Charged by her shogun with recovering the Twelve Deviant Blades of Kiki Shikizaki, Togame recruits Shichika Yasuri for help in her mission. Because Shichika is a master of a swordless fighting style, he won’t be tempted to steal the blades for himself like everyone else Togame tried to hire. A passionate man who is proud to fight for love, Shichika is happy to leave his home and aid Togame.
Historical ninja were not given to flashy swordplay, but that isn’t why the Maniwa Ninja Corps are competing with Shichika and Togame to find the Deviant Blades. They are all about that money and looking to sell them for a fortune. While real ninja tended to dress like regular people to blend in, the Maniwa blow right past the stereotypical head-to-toe black robes and go around in colorful, conspicuous costumes.





 4  Shinobi No Ittoki 
2022 - Available on Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime Video
        

For centuries, two of the most prominent schools of ninjutsu were based in the Iga and Kouga regions of Japan. Multiple anime utilize the premise of a bitter rivalry between these distinct disciplines to drive their plot. Shinobi no Ittoki is just among the newest ninja shows to do so.
His entire life, Ittoki Sakuraba has been relentlessly sheltered, but from what, he doesn’t know. He finally gets his answer in high school, after a girl asks him out on a date only to try and kill him once they’re alone. As the secret heir to the Iga clan, Ittoki will have to train hard to fend off the many more Kouga assassins after his head.





 3  Ninja Slayer 
2015 - Available on Funimation, Crunchyroll, Tubi
        

In this dystopian future, technology is cutting-edge, but the souls of the ninja terrorizing the people of Neo-Saitama are hundreds of years old. Kenji Fujikido really should have read up on the city’s crime statistics before moving his family there: they are soon killed by the Soukai Syndicate. In his grief, Kenji is possessed by the soul of Naraku Ninja, whose power he uses to take vengeance on the Syndicate.
Among the many ninja anime out there, it’s unique for its cyberpunk style, brought to life by Studio Trigger doing what they do best. There are no purely heroic ninja in this show, only the vicious Ninja Slayer and every evil soul tormenting humanity. Kenji fights with martial arts, shuriken, and other tools, and is good at sneaking into strongholds, making him more of a ninja than the yakuza-like Syndicate.





 2  Basilisk 
2005 - Available on Crunchyroll, Funimation
        

Famed shinobi Hattori Hanzou and shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu join the Iga and Kouga clans as historical figures made larger than life by anime. To decide which of Ieyasu’s grandsons will succeed him, the truce Hanzou brokered between the clans is broken. Now, the clans eagerly resume their feud, sending warriors to represent each heir and fight to the death for them.
This would be a very bad time to be madly in love with the enemy clan’s heir. Unfortunately, that’s what’s happened to both Gennosuke and Oboro, whose engagement is broken along with the truce between their clans. As the deadly competition rages on, with one of the best revenge plots in anime playing out behind the scenes, the lovers must fight to keep their relationship and their families alive.





 1  Blood Reign: Curse Of The Yoma 
1989 - Available on Roku
        

Blood Reign&#39;s anime adaptation consists of two 50-minute OVAs. 

In feudal Japan, the Takeda clan were among the most prominent samurai families. Throughout their extensive historical records, though, there’s no story quite like this. Marou and Hikage are shinobi loyal to the Takeda, until one night the head of the clan is murdered by a demon and Hikage vanishes.
Marou’s mission starts out as “find and kill Hikage,” for fear of other clans taking advantage of the Takeda’s vulnerability. But the story of Blood Reign extends far further than any shinobi could have imagined, as the entire country is threatened by the vengeful forces of Hell itself. A shinobi’s actions aren’t in a vacuum: the pain and rage of every soul killed in the recent war fuel the monstrous youma, allowing them to cause more chaos and death.
Ninja anime often borrow from real-life roots to tell the most interesting possible stories about a very eventful era and its influence on Japanese history. To this end, however, creators put their own flair on these stories, making them stand out from the rest with flashy powers, supernatural elements, and unique character designs. The most interesting ninja anime include both true classics and modern-age masterpieces.
