# Big Franchise Takes The Spot As Most-Watched Anime Of 2023


## SUMMARY 



  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba had the most viewership in 2023, surpassing other top anime by a wide margin.   The upcoming Hashira Training arc has been criticized as a weak storyline, potentially impacting the success of Demon Slayer in 2024.   Despite possible criticisms, Demon Slayer&#39;s previous success suggests that it will continue to be a major hit, maintaining its popularity among fans.

## Literature Review

2023 was a big year for anime, and according to an official report, one franchise stood out as the biggest anime of the year by a wide margin.




2023 was a great year for anime, and to the surprise of few, it turns out that Demon Slayer was 2023’s most-watched anime. It&#39;s no secret that Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the biggest anime in recent memory. Every new installment has been met with incredible critical and financial success, with Demon Slayer: Mugen Train still being the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, and it maintaining that level of success years after the manga’s ending is an excellent statement of the franchise’s staying power.




All this is why it&#39;s no surprise Demon Slayer was 2023&#39;s biggest anime. According to an X post by Shonen Jump News, the Japanese marketing company Video Research found that Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba season 3 was the most-viewed anime in 2023 with an average of 15.4 million viewers. The TV airing of the season 2 compilation film was the second-most-viewed anime with an average of 10.3 million viewers.


 

Those are amazing numbers for the series, especially when compared to the other top anime of 2023, and it’s a perfect showing of just how big Demon Slayer has become.

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba had amazing viewership in 2023, and that’s especially true when compared to other anime. Following Demon Slayer in the top two spots, Sazae-san took 3rd place with 9.96 million viewers in 2023, followed by the Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End series premiere with 7.94 million and Detective Conan with 6.99 million. While there isn’t a large gap between 2nd and 3rd place, Demon Slayer’s total viewership adds up to 25.7 million, almost three times as much as Sazae-san, so it’s clear that Demon Slayer took the top spot by a wide mile.

 Rank  Series  Viewership   1  Demon Slayer Season 3  15.4 Million   2  Demon Slayer Red Light District Arc  10.3 Million   3  Sazae-san  9.96 Million   4  Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End  7.94 Million   5  Detective Conan  6.99 Million   








 Will Demon Slayer Repeat Its Massive Success In 2024? 
          

2023 was a big year for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, but it might not repeat that success in 2024. 2024 will see the release of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba season 4, the Hashira Training arc, and that arc has often been seen as one of the weakest arcs in the series for how little story there is, making it come off as little more than padding before the final arc. With that in mind, it’s possible that the Hashira Training arc’s poor reception could lead to Demon Slayer not having as much success as it had in 2023.

                  Demon Slayer Season 4 Story, Latest News, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   A fourth season of Demon Slayer has been confirmed. Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s publicly known about the next season of the hit anime series.   




That might not necessarily be the case, however. The Swordsmith Village arc, for example, is also seen as one of the weaker arcs, but that didn’t stop Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba from being the most-viewed anime in 2023, so the series has likely garnered enough success at this point for the anime to always be a major hit, regardless of any criticisms that may arise. Even if that is the case, hopefully, that won’t stop Demon Slayer season 4 from being another great installment in the franchise that more than lives up to all the success it’s achieved over the years.
