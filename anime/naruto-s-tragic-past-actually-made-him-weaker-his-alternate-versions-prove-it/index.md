# Naruto s Tragic Past Actually Made Him Weaker &amp; His Alternate Versions Prove It


## SUMMARY 



  Two non-canonical versions of Naruto prove that he could have been more powerful and achieved more at an earlier age if he hadn&#39;t lost his parents.   Menma Uzumaki and Menma Namikaze, both created by the Infinite Tsukuyomi, outmatch Naruto in raw power and possess advanced techniques beyond what Naruto has.   Naruto&#39;s lack of guidance from his parents prevented him from reaching his full potential, making his character development and growth even more impressive in comparison.

## Literature Review

As much of a juggernaut as Naruto is by the story&#39;s end, his alternate-universe versions show that he still could have achieved greater power.




Even though the eponymous protagonist of Naruto is known for his cavalcade of power-ups, it can be argued that he could have been even more powerful. Naruto&#39;s fans believe that his tragic past made him stronger, but there are two alternative versions of the hero, both named Menma, who are stronger than the original, despite never losing their parents.




The Naruto series is notorious for its runaway power scaling. While the story started with subterfuge, it ended in battles with gods. Naruto himself kept up in the shonen arms race with his various forms and abilities, but Menma&#39;s non-canonical displays show that he could have gone further, sooner. Given the only major distinction between them is their backstories, it is clear that the ninja&#39;s tragic childhood also deprived him of an early power boost.


 Menma Shows What Naruto Could Have Achieved If He Hadn&#39;t Lost His Parents 
          

Menma has appeared not once, but twice, in two different interpretations, and both easily outmatch Naruto in raw power. While better known for being the antagonist Menma Uzumaki in the Road to Ninja movie, he also appeared as Menma Namikaze in episode #427 of the Naruto Shippuden anime in a more heroic light. In either case, the character displayed more advanced techniques than Naruto has, with Uzumaki possessing complete control over a black Kurama, and a variety of summons to boot, while Namikaze is shown with a Nine-Tails Mode that is more powerful than what Naruto had at his equivalent age.




          

Granted, both are dreamed-up variations created by the Infinite Tsukuyomi, but the writers behind these iterations try to answer the same question - what if Naruto had his parents while growing up? Minato and Kushina were both powerful warriors, so it stands to reason that, under their tutelage, their son would have sooner come to grips with his status and powers as a Jinchuriki. It&#39;s plausible that Naruto floundered in his early days due to the lack of guidance, preventing him from achieving his full potential.

          




Of course, Naruto&#39;s canonical story and evolution is the one that is closer to the vision of the author, Masashi Kishimoto. Naruto follows the path of a typical shonen hero, defined by his determination and by how he overcame a tragic past. By the end of the story, fans can more easily identify with the progress and growth that Naruto had over the years. However, looking at his alternative versions, Menma Uzumaki and Menma Namikaze, proves that Naruto truly faced an uphill battle due to growing up without his parents.

Naruto is available from Crunchyroll and Funimation.
