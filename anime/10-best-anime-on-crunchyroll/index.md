## Literature Review

Crunchyroll has an abundance of noteworthy anime, but with so many options, deciding which are the best can be a difficult task for anime fans.




The best anime on Crunchyroll can be difficult to narrow down simply because there are so many great series to choose from. Since it launched in 1994, Crunchyroll has built a reputation as one of the best websites for anime, film, and television. Not only do they have an abundance of genres, but many series are available in both their subbed and dubbed versions.
That being said, first-time visitors may experience a bit of choice paralysis while sifting through the hundreds of titles on Crunchyroll. From action to psychological thriller, sports anime to supernatural, which series on the streaming platform are actually the best? Some of them are quite popular (with good reason), while others are hidden gems that have flown under the radar.









 








 10  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju (2013) 
Based on the Manga By Haruko Kumota
        

  Studio   Deen    Episodes   25    Dub Available   No    
Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu follows Yotaro, a former yakuza who strives to be the next great rakugo performer of his generation. To master this traditional and comedic form of storytelling, he seeks out the elderly Bon, the greatest rakugo performer of his time. The series primarily explores Bon&#39;s ascent to stardom in the early 20th century. Despite rakugo&#39;s similarities to stand-up comedy, the series is melancholic and not for the faint of heart. Not only is Rakugo an anime that shows the beauty of Japanese culture, it&#39;s also one of the most psychologically probing series ever made.

 9  The Vampire Dies in No Time (2021) 
Based on the Manga By Itaru Bonnoki
        

  Studio   Madhouse    Episodes   24    Dub Available   Yes    
First airing in 2021, The Vampire Dies in No Time is a gut-busting &#34;odd couple&#34; anime. Ronaldo, a renowned writer and vampire hunter, is forced to become roommates with the vampire lord Draluc. In popular lore, not much can kill a vampire, but as the title suggests, Draluc can be killed by almost anything, such as a jumpscare, resulting in gags galore. Vampire boasts a memorable ensemble cast, including Fukuma, the bone-chillingly eerie editor of Ronaldo&#39;s manuscripts, and Etiquette Breacher, a vampire who disdains social norms. Most iconic of all is Draluc&#39;s pet armadillo, John, one of the most adorable creature companions in anime.

 8  Kuroko&#39;s Basketball (2012) 
Based on the Manga By Tadatoshi Fujimaki


 







  Studio   Production I.G.    Episodes   75 &#43; 3 OVAs    Dub Available   No    
It&#39;s easy to see why the sports anime Kuroko&#39;s Basketball is one of the best in the genre. The series chronicles Tetsuya Kuroko, a high school basketball player with a hidden skill set, and his colorful cast of teammates on their way to the championships. Fast-paced with genuine edge-of-your-seat thrills, Kuroko manages to keep the momentum going for 75 episodes and multiple movies. The anime even has a sense of humor in its heightened reality -- basketball players can quite literally enter &#34;The Zone,&#34; a state of mind and body on the court where their skills rival that of superheroes.

 7  Yona of the Dawn (2014) 
Based on the Manga By Mizuho Kusanagi
        

  Studio   Pierrot    Episodes   24 &#43; 3 OVAs    Dub Available   Yes    
Yona of the Dawn is a shoujo fantasy series that deserved a second season. The protagonist, Yona, grew up a spoiled and sheltered princess until her childhood friend&#39;s betrayal forced her to flee her castle with her bodyguard, Hak Son. Watching Yona&#39;s emotional growth as she goes from sheltered royal to self-sufficient and powerful fighter is a deeply fulfilling experience. In keeping with the genre, the series contains plenty of beautiful men, including the self-absorbed Jae-Ha and the cunning Su-Won. Above all, Yona&#39;s budding attraction to Hak Son will leave romance fans positively giddy for more.

 6  ERASED (2016) 
Based on the Manga By Kei Sanbe
        

  Studio   A-1 Picture    Episodes   12    Dub Available   No    
ERASED does the seemingly impossible: it&#39;s genre-bending and still quite an accessible series for people who don&#39;t like anime. The protagonist, Satoru Fujinuma, has the ability to travel back several minutes into the past when tragedy occurs. When Satoru is accused of a murder he didn&#39;t commit, he is sent back a full 18 years, where it is revealed that the murder may be linked to a former classmate. Equal parts mystery, psychological thriller, slice of life, and science fiction, ERASED accomplishes a great deal over the course of 12 episodes without ever feeling rushed.

 5  Death Parade (2015) 
Created By Yuzuru Tachikawa
        

  Studio   Madhouse    Episodes   12    Dub Available   Yes    
In Death Parade, purgatory takes the form of a swanky bar, where the bartenders pass judgment on where its visitors will spend the afterlife. The anime follows a bartender named Decim and his human assistant, Chiyuki, exploring complex themes of morality, power, and the full spectrum of human emotion. Mysteries abound, such as what Chiyuki is doing there in the first place and whether Decim can feel human emotions at all. In spite of a fun anime opening that is outright misleading, the series has several episodes that are guaranteed tearjerkers. Fans of xxxHolic and Psycho-Pass will find a lot to love with Death Parade.

 4  SK8 the Infinity (2021) 
Created By Hiroko Utsumi
        

  Studio   Bones    Episodes   12    Dub Available   Yes    
Released several months into COVID-19, SK8 the Infinity was just the right dose of escapism in an anxious and weary world. High schooler Reki Kyan introduces transfer student Langa to the underground skating rink known as S. The cast is iconic, ranging from the relentlessly bickering Joe and Cherry to the flamboyantly ruthless skater Adam. Even at its highest emotional peaks, the show never takes itself too seriously -- there are plenty of moments of fanservice, including an iconic beach episode. The English dub of Sk8 the Infinity also hilariously good fun; even sub-purists are encouraged to check it out.

 3  Chainsaw Man (2022) 
Based on the Manga By Tatsuki Fujimoto


 







  Studio   Mappa    Episodes   12    Dub Available   Yes    
Chainsaw Man has completely dominated pop culture over the past year, and it&#39;s easy to see why. A big draw is its wacky premise -- the main character, Denji, makes a contract to fuse his body with his dog-like companion, Pochita, granting him the power to transform his body into chainsaws. He later joins a government agency to take down devils, and his motive for doing so is hilariously straightforward. A memorable supporting cast, superior art direction, and even a character inspired by South Park are just a few of the reasons to give Chainsaw Man a try.

 2  Mob Psycho 100 (2016) 
Based on the Manga By ONE


 







  Studio   Bones    Episodes   37 &#43; 2 OVAs    Dub Available   Yes    
Since 2016, Mob Psycho 100 has been declared a masterpiece in animation, music, and well-written characters. Shigeo Kageyama, known as Mob, is a middle school psychic who works part-time exorcising powerful spirits with his boss, Reigen, who acts as a sort of father figure. Though it doesn&#39;t happen often, Mob&#39;s psychic energy sometimes reaches its breaking point (or 100%), causing him to go wild with power. The series is colorful, thrilling, wholesome, and an anime beginners must watch. Though the third and final season wrapped last year, the fanbase is just as enthusiastic and active as ever.

 1  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2009) 
Based on the Manga By Hiromu Arakawa
        

  Studio   Bones    Episodes   64    Dub Available   Yes    
One of the best fantasy anime of all time and the top-rated series on MyAnimeList, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is as critically acclaimed as they come. The good news: it lives up to the hype. Brothers Edward and Alphonse lost portions of their bodies trying to resurrect their mother through alchemy, and the series chronicles their quest to get their bodies back. Awash with political intrigue, philosophy, and edge-of-your-seat action, Brotherhood is an alchemical tour de force. It&#39;s also worth noting that Brotherhood boasts some of the most three-dimensional women in anime, which is especially noteworthy for a shonen series. Given its critical and fan acclaim, no one should be surprised that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is Crunchyroll&#39;s best anime series.
