## Literature Review

Boruto was originally intended to be a story about the “next generation”, but this is only becoming true now that Two Blue Vortex has begun.





In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #2, Konoha is invaded by Code and his army of Claw Grime soldiers. Naturally, Konoha&#39;s security divisions are tasked with responding to the threat, but what is surprising is that the majority of shinobi stepping onto the battlefield are members of the next generation. Even more importantly, except for the current Hokage Shikamaru, not a single member of the previous generation is present in the chapter. This finally gives the true protagonists of Boruto a chance to shine, including characters who have been criminally ignored in the manga.





 Boruto Part 2 Gives The New Generation The Role That Fans Demanded 
          

This is not the first time that the next generation has occupied the center stage in Boruto. The initial few story arcs of the manga largely focus on the young shinobi in training. Indeed, the first ten chapters detail how Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuko negotiate the trials and tribulations of the Chunin Exam. Nonetheless, all these initial arcs were anchored by a member of the older generation. Moving forward, characters such as Naruto and Sasuke became more and more prominent, giving fans the impression that the series was too scared to step away from Naruto&#39;s shadow and rely completely on the new characters.

This is not the case in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex. The kids introduced in Boruto are now teenagers ranging in age from 15 to 19 years old, and they are in command. For example, while Shikamaru is the standing Hokage, the first two chapters give the impression that it&#39;s really Kawaki who holds true power. Chapter #2 puts the spotlight on Shikadai, Cho Cho, Inojin, and even Iwamari, who all jump into the fray to protect their village. Meanwhile, Boruto is facing (alone, as Sasuke still has to show up) the big villain, Code, who is also a young character introduced in the sequel. As Naruto is still trapped in another dimension, it seems that the next generation has finally replaced their elders.






 Boruto&#39;s Young Shinobi Will Make The Story More Interesting 
          

Although it might have taken longer than expected, Boruto is finally starting to live up to its &#34;next generation moniker&#34;. It couldn&#39;t have come at a better time, as more than a few fans would agree that the story had grown stale. Now with the next generation fully in charge and active in the plot, there&#39;s a plethora of new stories and angles that Boruto: Two Blue Vortex can take - all outside the shadow of the elder shinobi introduced in Naruto.

Boruto: The Blue Vortex #2 is now available from Viz Media.
