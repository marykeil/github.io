  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Saiki from
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K
and Shigeo from
Mob Psycho 100
are both psychic characters who, despite their amazing abilities, find them a nuisance and want to live a quiet life isntead.
Other characters such as Hanajima from
Fruits Basket
had to deal with bullying due to their powers, and had to learn how to accept their abilities.
As shown in
AKIRA
, psychic abilities always come at a cost and, if left unchecked, risk destroying their users and the world around them.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Psychic powers are very common in anime, and they can be both versatile and make their users incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>The best psychics in anime all bring something new and exciting to one of the most prominent power sets in the medium. From telekinesis to mind control to command over nature itself, psychic powers can take essentially any form. So every anime that features them has the chance to do something creative with them.
Psychic characters are usually young, with the challenge of controlling their powers added to the already heavy burden of growing up and working out who they are. Often, they understand their powers just as little as everyone around them. If they can harness them, they’ll achieve their highest potential; if not, they’ll unleash untold destruction.</p>
<p>10  Kusuo Saiki - The Disastrous Life of Saiki K
2016-2018 - Available on Netflix, Tubi, Funimation</p>
<p>Many psychic characters take a while to adjust to having powers. Saiki is perfectly used to his powers: he just doesn’t like them. He reasons that they’re more of a nuisance than a help to him, despite how he could easily use them to get anything he wanted, except the one thing he really craves: a quiet, mundane life.
The anime takes its absurd premise and gleefully runs with it: Saiki’s absolute arsenal of psychic powers would make him an incredibly broken action protagonist, but they’re also perfect for comedy. Saiki’s cold and withdrawn behavior paradoxically makes him a magnet for every zany character in the show, all determined to befriend him. Between dealing with others and his powers, Saiki constantly has his hands full.</p>
<p>9  Saki Hanajima - Fruits Basket
2019-2021 - Available on Funimation, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>The original Fruits Basket aired in 2001 and is streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Amazon Prime Video</p>
<p>Even in one of the best fantasy shoujo anime, centered around a family cursed to turn into animals when hugged, Hanajima stands out. Her powers are never fully explained, unlike the Zodiacs, who at least have a folktale backstory, or her brother, who has to go out of his way to study the occult. She was just born with psychic powers and now has to deal with them.
Hanajima is one of Tohru’s staunchest defenders, scaring bullies away from her meeker friend. However, she used to be viciously bullied for her powers, which she was terrified of, and convinced herself she deserved the abuse after making one bully faint by wishing him dead. It was only after meeting Tohru and Arisa that she began to accept that she didn&rsquo;t deserve punishment for having powers.</p>
<p>8  Yuu Otosaka - Charlotte
2015 - Available on Hulu and Crunchyroll</p>
<p>At first, Yuu uses his ability to possess another person’s body for five seconds for some very unsavory behavior. But when he’s caught and forced to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy, he learns that not only is he far from the only psychic teenager around, but their abilities come at a terrible cost. He’ll have to shape up quickly if he wants to keep himself and his loved ones alive.
Every Hoshinoumi student has a psychic ability that awakens in adolescence. Often, they come at a terrible cost, and the user must either work to gain control of them or stop using them entirely before it’s too late. Worse, the kids of Hoshinoumi don’t have anyone else to turn to, and must locate and protect one another from those who would take advantage of them.</p>
<p>7  Sabrina - Pokémon
1997-present - Available on Netflix, Hulu, Tubi, and The Roku Channel</p>
<p>Many streaming services only have certain seasons of Pokémon available.</p>
<p>There are over one hundred Psychic-type Pokémon capable of everything from levitation to hypnosis to future sight. However, there are only a few humans who share such abilities, and the most prominent one is Sabrina, Gym Leader of the Saffron Gym. Her powers make her as mysterious and fearsome as any powerful Psychic-type.
Anime Sabrina is much more malicious than her game counterpart, who doesn’t much like battling, but acquiesces to her visions of strong challengers in the future. Her powers, despite still including the ability to communicate with Pokémon, leave her desperately lonely and mentally broken. Her desire for companionship combined with a marked sadistic streak lead her to use her powers to trap and torment others.</p>
<p>6  Anya Forger - Spy X Family
2022-2023 - Available on Hulu and Crunchyroll</p>
<p>With a spy father and assassin mother, it’s almost natural that the child of the Forger family is a mind reader. Four-year-old Anya is desperate to stay in her newfound home, not be abandoned again, and never let anyone find out about her powers. She fears that if she does, she’ll wind up back at the orphanage or worse, at the lab that kept her to study her powers.
Anya might rely on her telepathic powers to get by in the world, but they cause her just as many problems as they solve. She’s privy to everyone’s thoughts, but is still a young child with a child’s understanding of the complex adult problems she’s listening in to. Adopting a future-predicting dog helps her feel less alone in the “escaped lab experiment” department, but Bond’s problem-solving skills are also about fifty-fifty, creating some hilarious shenanigans.</p>
<p>5  Akiza Izinski - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds
2008-2011 - Available on Tubi, Pluto TV, Peacock, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, VIX</p>
<p>Most streaming services only carry a limited number of seasons of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds.</p>
<p>Akiza’s psychic powers isolated her from other people since childhood, when they accidentally went off during a duel and injured her father. This made her especially vulnerable to the manipulations of Sayer, who recruits other psychics to help him take over the world. After rejecting Sayer’s intentions for her and befriending Yusei’s group, she gains greater control over her powers than ever before.
Akiza can bring her Duel Monsters to life, often using them to attack when she is stressed or afraid. She is telekinetic and, like Luna, can see Duel Monster spirits. After accepting and connecting with her powers as a member of Team 5Ds, Akiza also unlocks an ability to heal injuries.</p>
<p>4  Tatsumaki - One-Punch Man
2015-2019 - Available on Netflix and Hulu</p>
<p>Tatsumaki’s psychic powers make her one of the strongest heroes in One Punch Man. An S-Class hero second only to Blast, Tatsumaki can control any and all matter with just her mind. Unlike Saitama and other heroes who trained and evolved over time, Tatsumaki has been incredibly powerful since birth, which unfortunately caused her to be kept in a lab as an experiment subject, until Blast freed her.
The Hero Association depends on her to bail the Earth out of trouble in the direst of straits. She’s never learned how to hold back in battle (or in her personal relationships, but that’s a different story), so is constantly giving 110%. She’s constantly using her power to float everywhere, and is introduced summoning a meteor down from space to kill a Godzilla-esque monster.</p>
<p>3  Haruhi Suzumiya - The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya
2006-2009 - Available on Crunchyroll and Funimation</p>
<p>It’s very unusual for psychics powerful enough to end the world as we know it to not be aware of their powers at all. As much as Haruhi Suzumiya is interested in the paranormal and in people with special abilities, she has zero idea that she is the most daunting of them all. The SOS Brigade is tasked with keeping Haruhi’s powers under control without Haruhi herself ever finding out about them.
Haruhi affects reality without realizing it, making herself effortlessly good at everything. This extends to the other people she chooses as her friends, giving them special abilities that will keep her entertained on their various adventures. Nobody on Earth or off is capable of categorizing exactly what she is, only that she is absolutely off the charts and that, if left unchecked, she could end the world.</p>
<p>2  Akira - AKIRA
1988 - Available on Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Funimation</p>
<p>Akira is a movie (based on the manga of the same name) that changed the history of anime forever. It tells the story of Akira and his fellow Espers, the result of government experiments that killed many other subjects. The explosion that destroyed the original Tokyo was caused by Akira, the strongest of the group, whose psychic abilities grew so powerful he ascended to a form of pure energy. His remaining friends are forced onto heavy drugs to keep their powers under control.
Tetsuo Shima, upon learning of Akira&rsquo;s existence, goes on a rampage in Neo-Tokyo in the hope of absorbing his powers. This leads to Tetsuo undergoing one of the most painful transformations in anime, which shows just how dangerous unrestrained psychic power can be, going on a sadistic power trip that ends in his mutation into an enormous fleshy monster that can’t be restrained by anyone, least of all Tetsuo himself. In the end, the only thing able to stop him is the efforts of all the psychics to transport themselves and Tetsuo to another dimension.</p>
<p>1  Shigeo Kageyama - Mob Psycho 100
2016-2022 - Available on Crunchyroll and Hulu</p>
<p>The strongest psychic powers dwell inside the gentlest and humblest Esper. Mob&rsquo;s been afraid of his constantly roiling powers ever since a childhood incident, which led him to develop an introvert personality. Despite being the most powerful psychic on Earth, his only desire is to be accepted for who he is - without his powers. His life changes after meeting Reigen, a fake Esper who however can teach him the best life lessons. Throughout his struggles, Mob keeps his belief that powers don’t make anyone special, for good or evil, which helps him develop a healthier mindset than many other Espers.
As Mob is confronted by greater threats, he must release more and more of his power and get in touch with the emotions that drive the worst explosions of them. At their peak, his psychic abilities make him more or less a force of nature but Mob’s true strengths are his kind and honest nature, and his determination to improve as a person.</p>
<p>Mob Psycho 100&rsquo;s Finale is the Perfect Capstone for the Series
Not many anime can maintain a high level of quality throughout, but Mob Psycho 100&rsquo;s skillful finish assures fans that the series is as great as ever.</p>
<p>Psychic powers have no limits, and neither do the possibilities present in creating a psychic character. They struggle with controlling their powers, balancing them with a normal life, and pushing past whatever obstacles face them and their loved ones. Done right, characters with psychic powers can be some of the most interesting in anime.
