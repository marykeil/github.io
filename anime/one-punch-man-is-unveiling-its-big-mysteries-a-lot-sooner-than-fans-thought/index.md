## Literature Review

One-Punch Man&#39;s latest chapter ended in a place that suggests it&#39;s about time for the truth about God and many other mysteries to come out.





Manako AKA Oculette, is a monster that was encountered by Saitama and Flashy Flash in the Monster Association HQ, and was with them when they discovered the mysterious cube that connected them with God. Blast, of course, showed up shortly thereafter, taking the cube into his own possession and helping all three to finally escape the underground base. Blast seemed to know more than he let on, but he left quickly, without giving Saitama&#39;s group time to really ask any questions.




          

Chapter #194 of One-Punch Man seemingly makes a big push forward toward the explanation of some of the current big mysteries in the series. The chapter ends abruptly with Saitama and Flashy Flash locating Blast at the Hero Association HQ with surprising ease, suggesting that the next chapter will actually give them a chance to talk, and perhaps learn more about God and Blast&#39;s relationship with it.


 Blast&#39;s Appearance Means That He Is About To Explain The Secrets Behind God&#39;s Threat 
          

Within the world of One-Punch Man, Blast is a rarely-seen figure, to the extent that his abilities are almost completely unknown even this deep into the story. Since even the Monster Association battle wasn&#39;t enough to draw his attention, there&#39;s an implication that whatever Blast is up to, it&#39;s incredibly important. This was confirmed when Sitch, a Hero Association executive, gathered a group of S-Class heroes to tell them about Blast and his ongoing, twenty years-long battle against God. This crusade, and God&#39;s power to &#34;corrupt&#34; people, led Blast to cut ties with the Heroes Association. As a result, though, Blast hasn&#39;t really had a chance to see what Saitama can do.




Given how slowly the God plot has unraveled in the manga so far, it was quite surprising to see that Saitama and friends were able to locate Blast so quickly - even if it was played for comedy effect. Flashy-Flash spent several chapters tracking Manako, and after all that it turned out that Manako really didn&#39;t know much more about God than the heroes do. Assuming that Blast is actually willing to talk to them, there could finally be some real explanation about what God is and what kind of threat it actually poses. Perhaps Blast might even be aware of the &#34;Abominable Fist that Has Turned Against God,&#34; and realize that it actually describes Saitama.



 One-Punch Man Is Not Afraid To Explain Its Mysteries Sooner Than Fans Expect 
          

Aside from the potential lore and exposition, this may offer fans an opportunity to get to know Blast as a character a bit, too. So far, Blast has been shown to be kind to Tatsumaki, and very mission-focused when out in the field, but other than that, his personality is fairly unknown. More importantly, this is further proof that the series is not afraid to subvert the genre&#39;s tropes by letting its main characters literally stumble into the explanation for such big mysteries, despite the very long buildup. After all, in the previous chapter, Saitama did a &#34;speedrun&#34; to a fight with a final boss in a fantasy world, which could be foreshadowing an upcoming battle with God. Even if that fight doesn&#39;t happen so soon, Blast&#39;s appearance will surely shed some light on one of the biggest mysteries in the One-Punch Man manga so far.
