## Literature Review

Never at a loss for words, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Gojo had an exceptional gift of gab. It wasn&#39;t all braggadocio, though, much was quite profound.




As a teacher, mentor, and face of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s sorcerer community, Satoru Gojo&#39;s words matter. Moreover, Gojo had no problems voicing his opinions or making brash comments. He relished letting friends or foes, underlings, or colleagues know what he was thinking. Accordingly, for the parts of the story that he was in, Gojo was a walking generator of quotable quotes.
As the self-claimed, and widely acknowledged, most powerful wizard in the Jujustu sorcerer community, Gojo had an enormous ego. Gojo was also deeply concerned about Jujutsu society and felt a strong sense of responsibility to help it develop - by training the younger generation of sorcerers to be the best they can be. His teaching instincts made it easy for him to give advice. His pride made it easy for him to advise anyone he felt needed - which was everyone he met - including Sukuna. Indeed, Gojo couldn&#39;t help keeping his mouth shut. Naturally, with a personality like Gojo&#39;s, his quotes ran the gamut from heartfelt gratitude to biting revulsion; from constructive criticism to destructive satire. Below are Gojo&#39;s most memorable or noteworthy quotes that are - in the context of the story - worth remembering or highlighting.









 








 10  &#34;For Real Real. I Feel Like New.&#34; 
Chapter 74 &#34;Hidden Inventory&#34;, Season 2, Episode 4 &#34;Hidden Inventory 4&#34;
        

One of the more shocking events in the early part of the story was Toji Fushiguro&#39;s assassination of Gojo. Until that point, Gojo seemed invincible or, at the very least, able to put up a better fight than he did against Toji&#39;s initial push. The surprise and shock that fans felt was echoed in the expression on Gojo&#39;s face. If humiliation could be personified- Gojo was its poster boy. However, fans were equally surprised - as was Toji - by his complete recovery two chapters later. Not only does it demonstrate that Gojo is still his egotistical self, but more importantly, that he&#39;s found a means to be even better than he was before.





 9  &#34;They&#39;ll Be As Good As Me Someday.&#34; 
Chapter 11 &#34;The Dream&#34;, Season 1, Episode 6 &#34;After the Rain&#34;
        

With all his bluster and pushing of the personal brand, it’s clear that Gojo did not think highly of many other sorcerers in the community. Indeed, as his first encounter with Sukuna illustrated, he didn’t even think much of the King of Curses – the most feared sorcerer in the history of the world. That’s what makes this quote so interesting. Not only does he admit that there are others as good as him, but it also reveals Gojo&#39;s tacit admission that they have the potential to be better than him. That is, anyone as good as Gojo should either be able to defeat him or, at least, not be defeated by him - which, for Gojo, is as good as being defeated.





 8  &#34;I&#39;m Gonna Reset This Crappy Jujutsu World.&#34; 
Chapter 11 &#34;The Dream&#34;, Season 1, Episode 6 &#34;After the Rain&#34;
        

In his younger days as a student, Gojo enjoyed the whole Jujutsu sorcerer experience. He lived and breathed it, and came away happier from the experience. But with the cold-blooded murder of Riko Amanai, and his friend&#39;s steady descent into the darkness afterward, Gojo&#39;s understanding of the Jujutsu sorcerer community matured. He no longer saw the community as a source of his enjoyment but as a cabal that manipulated others, especially the youth, for their own interests. This quote succinctly elucidates Gojo’s contempt for community administration in its current form and his plan to change it for the better.





 7  &#34;Purple!&#34; 
Chapter 75 &#34;The Hidden Inventory, Part 11&#34;, Season 2, Episode 4 &#34;Hidden Inventory 4&#34;


 







Gojo was born with a silver spoon of magical abilities, namely, being the first Gojo clan member in recent memory to be born with both the Six Eyes and Limitless techniques. However, what he, and everyone else, did not know at the time was that Gojo also had the ability to use a secret, super-powerful, Gojo clan technique known as Purple. Purple combines Limitless&#39; Red and Bull abilities to unleash a massive destructive force. Gojo only discovered how to use Purple in the middle of his fight against Toji Fushiguro. The stress of dying, resurrecting, and fighting for his life again unlocked the secret of its use. This quote is the incantation that unleashes its power.





 6  &#34;Infinity Exists Everywhere.&#34; 
Chapter 14 &#34;Assault&#34;, Season 1, Episode 7 Assault&#34;


One of the reasons Gojo has such a big ego is because he truly is a powerful sorcerer. Power hasn’t corrupted Gojo, it just gave him an inflated belief in himself. However, one problem with fans&#39; understanding of his power is that it&#39;s hard to understand intuitively. This quote goes a long way to pulling back the curtain on his abilities. It reveals that, like the mathematical formula for infinity, the technique approximates the attempt to close the distance between two points moving in the same direction. According to the formula, the distance can never equal &#34;0&#34;, because the point ahead will always be infinitesimally ahead of the point behind. Since infinity is everywhere, Gojo can manipulate it such that nothing should be able to hit Gojo unless he decides to turn off the ability.





 5  &#34;I Have Faith In Everyone.&#34; 
Chapter 91 &#34;The Shibuya Incident, Part 9&#34;, Season 2, Episode 10 &#34;Pandemonium&#34;


 







The Shibuya Incident arc ended with Kenjaku pulling off one of the most important power moves in the story – he was able to trick Gojo just long enough to send him to the Prison Realm. Almost as soon as the trap was sprung, Gojo cursed himself for making a rookie mistake, and not having been more careful. Nevertheless, despite being the guy who always wants the final shot, this quote reveals how much Gojo has matured. That is, he realizes that he doesn’t need to rely on himself to get the win. Rather, he can rest assured that his team – Yuji, Nobara, Megumi, and the others won&#39;t just step forward and take up the fight, but actually win it.
Gojo includes Nobara Kugisaki among the students he has faith in. This is likely because, at the time that he was sealed in the prison realm, he had not learned of Nobara&#39;s fate. 






 4  &#34;I Hope You Don&#39;t Mind If I Show Off A Little.&#34; 
Chapter 2 &#34;Secret Execution&#34;, Season 1, Episode 2 &#34;For Myself&#34;


 







One of the subtler but more enjoyable elements of Gojo&#39;s personality is his sense of humor. At times, it can be exuberantly hilarious, even finding ways to use Digimon to a complex sorcerer&#39;s concept. At other times, it can be cutting and acerbic. However, it&#39;s always entertaining. Whether he uses it as a tactic to throw off an opponent, to cope with the stress of the situation, or whether he truly finds the situation - it&#39;s always entertaining. Moreover, it also provides a key marker of his attitude. When Gojo stops joking, he’s about to get serious. This quote is the perfect example of his sense of humor. Interestingly, he&#39;s used it twice, both times being right before fighting Sukuna.





 3  &#34;My Best Friend Did. My One And Only.&#34; 
Chapter 0.4 &#34;Bright Darkness&#34;, Jujutsu Kaizen 0
        

Gojo is the perfect example of a social introvert. He can, and does, hang out with others. He is not socially awkward in public – in fact, he quite enjoys the limelight. However, all these interactions are merely at the surface level. There’s no deeper connection with the people around him. He is engaging but aloof. Intuitively, this makes sense. He&#39;s been so powerful for so long that it&#39;s hard for him to relate on a personal level with anyone else. This quote exposes Gojo&#39;s loneliness. Geto was, for a time, as powerful as Gojo and suffered many of the same problems connecting with others. They quickly formed a deep bond, and for once in his life Gojo had a true friend - and it made him happy. The death of Riko Amanai changed that, and Gojo has been lonely ever since. After Geto, he had more in common with Sukuna than with other sorcerers.





 2  &#34;Love Is The Most Twisted Curse Of All.&#34; 
Chapter 0.1: &#34;The Cursed Child&#34;, Jujutsu Kaisen 0
        

This is an interesting quote largely due to those who made it. While Gojo is interested and cares for his students and the Jujutsu sorcerer community, there had been no evidence at that time that he&#39;d experienced the kind of love that existed between Yuta and Rika. In other words, it would not have been out of place for Yuta to ask Gojo, &#34;Who are you to tell me about love.&#34; However, upon deeper consideration, the quote is quite profound. Considering what we learn later about Gojo&#39;s relationship with Geto, it reveals that Gojo certainly knows enough to offer his opinion. On the other hand, based on the translation in the manga, the quote implies that curses, like Rika, who spawn as a result of negative emotions connected with love, are bound to be abnormal and mutant because the underlying emotion is so powerful and intense. Taken both ways, it reveals the comprehensiveness of Gojo&#39;s mindset and that he was looking for a way to help Yuta.
In the manga, Gojo says, &#34;I&#39;ve always believed love manifests the most distorted curses.&#34; 






 1  &#34;Nah, I&#39;d Win.&#34; 
Chapter 221: &#34;Gain and Loss&#34;
        

If there is any quote that distills the essence of Saturo Gojo, this is the one. It was made in response to a question from Yuji about whether Gojo would be able to defeat a resurrected Sukuna. Gojo&#39;s response was instinctual and immediate. It left little doubt in Yuji’s mind about who would win. Moreover, it&#39;s the type of response fans have come to expect. Other than his brush with Toji Fushiguro, no one has come close to stopping Gojo. Gojo never gets in a fight he thinks he&#39;ll lose, because every fight he gets into - he wins. It oozes Gojo’s brash and bombastic persona. It was also absolutely accurate - until it wasn&#39;t.
