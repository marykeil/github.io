## Literature Review

With only 9 more episodes to go in Season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen, a new trailer teases the apocalyptic conclusion of the Shibuya Incident Arc.




Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 has been the highlight of the year for its fans, and with not too many episodes remaining, an explosive teaser teases the brutal developments that will lead to the grand finale of the Shibuya Incident Arc.




The Shibuya Incident is the most beloved and brutal arc in Jujutsu Kaisen. With each episode that airs, the anime community can&#39;t stop discussing it, and for good reason. The arc features suspense that leaves viewers at the edge of their seats and incredibly shocking plot twists. With the Shibuya Incident Arc halfway done, a new teaser and key visual have been released.


 

Although short, the video is very disturbing as it hints at the return of the most evil and powerful curse of all time, Sukuna. Standing in front of Shibuya Crossing, Sukuna has an evil grin that says he is ready to wreak havoc.


 Sukuna Is The Most Terrifying Villain In The Series 
          




Back in Jujutsu Kaisen season 1, Itadori was killed by Sukuna who ripped out his heart while he took over the body. Before Itadori died, he made a deal with Sukuna that would give him 1 minute of control in exchange for reviving him. The only restrictions in this Heavenly Pact were that Itadori wouldn&#39;t remember the deal they made after he was revived and that Sukuna wouldn&#39;t harm any of Itadori&#39;s friends. Sukuna hasn&#39;t activated the pact yet, but with all the chaos and the fact that Gojo has been sealed away, there is nobody to stop him.

Sukuna&#39;s return could not happen at a worse time for the heroes, who are surrounded by Special Grade cursed spirits and have just witnessed the reveal of the true identity of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s main villain. If that weren&#39;t enough, the return of Toji Fushiguro puts the heroes in an even deeper bind. The appearance of Sukuna will be the nail in the coffin, and even though he is compelled to not hurt Yuji&#39;s friends, fans can be sure he is still up to something sinister.






 Sukuna&#39;s Comeback Will Change The Tide Of The Battle 
          

One of the main objectives of the curses is the revival of Sukuna. His reincarnation will usher in a new age of curses and will topple the current status quo between humans and curses. Known as the King Of Curses, Sukuna is as evil as he is powerful. A mastermind and brilliant tactician, he will surely make the most of the one minute he has to kickstart whatever his plan. Jujutsu Kaisen knows how to keep fans&#39; excitement as high as possible, and this new teaser trailer and visuals preannouncing the return of Sukuna will raise expectations for the finale of the Shibuya Incident Arc even more.
