## Literature Review

Boruto did a great job at picking up the torch where his father left off, but not all his adventures are created equal - here at the 10 best.





Debuting in 2017, the anime (available to stream on Crunchyroll and Hulu) hasn&#39;t seen all of its episodes get English dubs yet. That hasn’t stopped audiences outside of Japan from devouring the series and discussing just how the Boruto anime compares to the manga. Some fans hate the filler episodes that occur between breaks in arcs based on the manga, while others prefer the episodes with epic fight scenes. The truth is that the best Boruto episodes, however, showcase some of everything the show has to offer.

 15  Episode 203: Surprise Attack 
        

Boruto has a solid mixture of setup and action, but few episodes do both as well as episode 203, Surprise Attack. The episode sets up more than a few plot points for future episodes such as Boruto&#39;s Kama reactivating and Jigen&#39;s return, while also providing some solid fight scenes. While Jigen/Isshiki and Naruto&#39;s fight in later episodes is far more grand, the one present in Surprise Attack is still quite a thrilling brawl. Boruto often gets criticism for its mountain of filler, but Surprise Attack shows that when the series sticks to its main plot, it can do incredible things.





 14  Episode 186: How You Use It 
        

Few episodes show the new Team 7 acting as one cohesive unit quite like Boruto episode 186, How You Use It. The episode sees Boruto, Sarada, Mitsuki, and Konohamaru face the cybernetic ninja Ao. With Boruto being the main character and legacy fighters like Naruto and Sasuke hanging around, it isn&#39;t as often that Boruto gives Team 7 an important battle. This is what makes How You Use It such a great episode, as it&#39;s fun seeing the team use their various powers together in fun and interesting ways. While the episode doesn&#39;t quite have the spectacle or emotional gut-punch of Boruto&#39;s top episodes, its solid animation and fight choreography elevate it to something special.





 13  Episode 129: Village Hidden In The Leaves 
        

While the original Naruto series explores the idea of other dimensions and universes made from dreams, Boruto features more exploration of time and space, allowing for time travel. Boruto and Sasuke end up in the Konohagakure of the past, specifically during the years of the original Naruto series. The arc in the show is largely filler, but this episode allows Boruto to gain a new perspective on his father. Boruto thinks he is drastically different from Naruto, but this episode highlights how similar they really are when they both, as children, interact with a young Sakura and an adult Sasuke. While the audience has always known about their similarities, an episode focusing on them gives Boruto a new appreciation for his dad.





 12  Episode 23: Bonds Come In All Shapes 
        

Part of the appeal of the Boruto series is exactly that it is a sequel series. It continues storylines started when Naruto was a child and answers some questions that the audience might have. One of those questions is the sustainability of Sasuke and Sakura’s relationship. Though Sakura has always cared for him, Sasuke’s feelings haven’t always been so clear. Even their daughter Sarada is confused by the relationship between Sasuke and Sakura, which this episode highlights. Sarada learns how much they care about one another and her in this episode, making it one of the most emotional of the early episodes in the series, and one of the best Boruto episodes.





 11  Episode 207: Regeneration 
        

Boruto, Mitsuki, Sarada, and Kawaki have to work together in an attempt to defeat Boro in this episode. One of the aspects that makes this among the best Boruto episodes is the unique fight that results. All four of the young shinobi use their usual attacks, but Boro is either able to easily counter them, or completely regenerate any injured part of himself too quickly for the foursome to keep up. Eventually, Sarada is able to remove Boro’s core, the part of him that powers all of his scientific ninja tools. It really ups the science fiction factor of Boruto but also demonstrates how well the group works together despite all of their differences.





 10  Episode 208: Momoshiki’s Manifestation 
        

While this particular Boruto episode features the tail end of the fight from the previous episode, it’s the kind of episode that occurs in the climax of a mystery. It’s where all the parties involved in trying to solve the case put their clues together, but they still don’t have all the puzzle pieces. In this case, it’s Sarada, Boruto, Mitsuki, and Kawaki giving their different perspectives on the fight that occurred while Shikamaru speculates about the potential dangers of Kara. Naruto and Sasuke compare their own notes about the organization. It’s as though almost all the puzzle pieces are there for the audience to fit together, but a few are still out of reach.

 9  Episode 189: Resonance 
        

For fans who were waiting to see just how truly powerful Kawaki is (and hadn&#39;t read the manga yet), this is the Boruto episode they were waiting for. When Kara member Garo comes after Kawaki, intent on retrieving the &#34;vessel&#34; for the organization, Kawaki doesn&#39;t go down lightly, and Konohamaru, Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki can do little more than watch the carnage unfold. Kawaki is able to literally punch a hole in the other man&#39;s stomach with an arm that changes shape. Then, when all is said and done, he blows up his enemy before his energy is depleted, warning everyone else he&#39;ll do the same to them if he finds out that they&#39;re enemies. It&#39;s a great way to tease just what the character can do.





 8  Episode 292: Hunger 
        

Regardless of how Naruto fans feel about Boruto as a character, it&#39;s undeniable that his &#39;death&#39; in Hunger was one of the series&#39; most shocking moments. The image of Kawaki blowing a hole straight through Boruto is powerful enough on its own. More than just a surprising twist though, Boruto&#39;s demise is a fantastic setup. Fans know the young ninja lives from the flash-forward, so the question becomes how he survives and what this means for his future fight with Kawaki. All of it is compelling stuff, leading into the next episode and next part flawlessly.





 7  Episode 286: Sasuke&#39;s Story: The Ring 
        

Sasuke&#39;s relationship to Sakura has always been controversial among fans of Naruto, and unfortunately, Boruto made it worse in some respects. This is why the Sasuke&#39;s Story sub-series is such a breath of fresh air. The mini-arc sees Sasuke infiltrating a prison in order to find a cure for a mysterious illness afflicting Naruto. Using her own skills, Sakura also infiltrates the prison by becoming its doctor. The entire arc is quality from the start, but it&#39;s the final episode The Ring which is the best of the bunch. Any fan of Sasuke and Sakura&#39;s relationship owes it to themselves to watch this episode as it finally shows just what makes the duo work so well together.





 6  Episode 216: Sacrifice 
        

As the title implies, one of the best Boruto episodes is all about heroes who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. In this case, it&#39;s Sasuke Uchiha, Naruto Uzumaki, and Boruto Uzumaki. The trio goes up against Isshiki, and when Boruto finds that his father and his mentor are both down and out, he makes a pretty gutsy choice. Boruto banks on the fact that Isshiki won&#39;t kill him and threatens to take his own life to protect the rest of the world. It&#39;s a big gamble, and it doesn&#39;t win the fight, but it buys him time. Naruto also chooses to take on a powerful new form, even though Kurama makes him aware it will likely kill him. Father and son have no qualms about dying to make sure everyone else lives, and it&#39;s both heartbreaking and a reminder of just what great heroes they&#39;ve become.





 5  Episode 217: Decision 
        

Picking up right where &#34;Sacrifice&#34; leaves off, the bulk of the episode centers on Naruto in his new Baryon Mode battling Isshiki. There are a lot of slick moves for fans of the fight scenes to play back, but the episode is also an emotional one. The truth is that the harder Naruto fights, the quicker he depletes his and Kurama&#39;s chakra, and his Baryon Mode consumes all chakra, meaning the longer the fight goes on, the closer to death they are. Kawaki&#39;s arm being tied to Naruto&#39;s chakra also means that Isshiki is able to summon him to the battle site, reminding him of all the trauma from his childhood. The episode provides a great balance between action-packed moments and emotional ones.





 4  Episode 204: He&#39;s Bad News 
        

The Boruto series has many big battles in alternate dimensions as a way to prevent Konoha from facing serious destruction. &#34;He&#39;s Bad News&#34; does that again with Naruto and Sasuke fighting Jigen. It makes for one of the best Boruto fight episodes of the show as it brings in a lot of interesting elements. Naruto and Sasuke are smart about taking on their opponent with Naruto using shadow clones to fight him, if only briefly, so Sasuke can analyze what they&#39;re up against. They discover that Jigen is the Naruto franchise&#39;s answer to Ant-Man. He can shrink himself and other matter during their fight. It&#39;s an interesting technique to see employed in the Naruto world, and one that makes battling him very difficult for two people who are used to using larger-than-life protections.

Orochimaru isn&#39;t exactly a good guy by the time Boruto and his own son are going to school. These are reasons why he is (and isn&#39;t) better now.








 3  Episode 65: Father And Child 
        

Centered on the leader of the new generation and the leader of the old generation, &#34;Father And Child&#34; is one of the best Boruto episodes. It takes Boruto a long time to see how like Naruto he is. “Father And Child” sees the two of them finally understand one another and work together. Though a team-up between Naruto and Sasuke does most of the work to defeat Momoshiki, it’s Naruto sharing his power with Boruto that allows his son to finish the enemy. This episode leads off the major mystery for the next run of the series as Momoshiki imparts a mysterious seal on Boruto before he passes. It&#39;s truly the episode that kicks off what Boruto is as a series with the family bonds and the beginning of new mythology.





 2  Episode 293: Farewell 
        

Boruto goes out on a massive high note with the appropriately titled Farewell. After Boruto&#39;s dramatic death in the previous episode, things slow down just a bit for Naruto to grieve over his son and Shikamaru to ask what to do about his murderer. It&#39;s a brilliant bit of characterization that Naruto wants to give Kawaki leniency despite what he&#39;d just done. All of it works, setting up Boruto and Kawaki&#39;s future conflict and where the series will go in its second part. Regardless of the episode&#39;s many strengths though, nothing in Farewell can top the image of a heartbroken Naruto cradling his dead son Boruto, changing the Seventh Hokage forever. While it&#39;s weakened slightly by the knowledge that Boruto will live, it&#39;s still enough to make Farewell one of Boruto&#39;s best episodes.





 1  Episode 218: Partner 
        

The partnership focus in the best Boruto episode is two-fold: that of Kawaki and Boruto, and that of Naruto and Kurama. Naruto has always had Kurama as a part of him, even when he wasn&#39;t aware as a child, and Kawaki and Boruto have come to think of themselves as brothers. Kawaki is willing to do anything to save Boruto and his family in this episode, just as Boruto Is ready to end his own life to save the world a few episodes earlier.
While Kawaki doesn&#39;t have to and is able to defeat Isshiki, Naruto does lose his partner in what might be one of the most emotional losses the franchise has ever had. Kurama admits that he didn&#39;t tell Naruto the entire truth because he knew he would die. Naruto is willing to die with him, but Kurama doesn&#39;t let that happen. It&#39;s a tragic Boruto episode, whos depth is complemented by the animators deciding to feature key Kurama moments in Naruto&#39;s life throughout the credits. Without Kurama, Naruto&#39;s power levels take a hit going forward, but he also loses a part of himself.
Despite the series&#39; reputation among fans of Naruto, Boruto has no shortage of standout episodes that deliver intense action, thoughtful characterization, or interesting drama. At its best, Boruto develops on its predecessor&#39;s ideas in compelling ways. The best episodes of Boruto prove that the series truly is a worthy followup to one of the most beloved anime series of all time.
