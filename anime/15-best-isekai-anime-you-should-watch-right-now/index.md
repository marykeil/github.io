## Literature Review

Even with the oversaturation of the genre, there are still plenty of excellent isekai anime shows worth streaming in the summer of 2023.




For better or worse, isekai is one of the biggest anime genres over the last decade, leading many fans to wonder what the best isekai anime available on streaming are. The genre became famous for showcasing stories of normal people getting transported to fantastical worlds where they&#39;re often granted special powers that allow them to save their new world. Though the genre is varied, isekai excels at putting relatable characters in fantastical situations.
With such a large catalog of anime to choose from, it can be difficult to decide which isekai is the best to invest time in, especially when so many series within the genre can have similar-sounding plot lines on the surface. Regardless, there are plenty of isekai worth binge-watching that offer a fun, refreshing spin on the genre. The best isekai anime on streaming show how wide and varied the genre truly is.









 








 15  Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon 
Based on the Light Novel Created By Hirukuma, Itsuwa Kato, &amp; Yūki Hagure
        

  Year Released   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
Reborn as a Vending Machine might be a new anime, but it&#39;s already one of the weirdest takes on isekai ever made. The series focuses on a nameless protagonist (referred to as Boxxo by the series&#39; characters) who is crushed by a vending machine and wakes up in a fantasy world as a vending machine. Far from a normal vending machine though, Boxxo has access to everything he had ever bought from a vending machine in his previous life. As silly as that seems, the resulting series finds plenty of clever uses for Boxxo&#39;s wares, making this isekai anime incredibly creative. Any interested fan can check out the first season of this hot new isekai anime which just finished airing on Crunchyroll!





 14  Digimon Adventure  
Based on the Toy Franchise Created By Bandai


 







  Year Released   1999    Number of Episodes   54    Where to Stream it   Hulu    
Though Digimon Adventure probably isn&#39;t the first series that comes to mind when fans think isekai, the seminal anime fits the genre quite well. Instead of one protagonist whisked off to a world where they&#39;re overpowered, Digimon Adventure sees a group of eight children band together to brave the wilds of the Digital World alongside their digital companions. Digimon Adventure is certainly not without fault, but the series holds up surprisingly well. Old fans looking for nostalgia and new fans looking for a different take on what an isekai anime could be should check out this classic which is currently streaming on Hulu.





 13  Inuyasha 
Based on the Manga Created By Rumiko Takahashi
        

  Year Released   200    Number of Episodes   167    Where to Stream it   Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Pluto TV    
Another classic anime that is actually an isekai in retrospect is Inuyasha. The series follows a young woman named Kagome who is mysteriously transported back in time to Feudal Japan where she meets the titular half-demon Inuyasha. From there the series develops and increasingly complex mythology as it&#39;s revealed that Kagome is actually the reincarnation of a priestess named Kikyo who plays an important role in Inuyasha&#39;s backstory. Though the result is quite different from a modern isekai anime, Inuyasha actually shares more in common with its spiritual successor than first appearances suggest. Any fan of isekai anime owes it to themselves to check out this classic streaming on Netflix.





 12  .hack//SIGN 
Based on the Franchise Created By Cyber Connect 2


 







  Year Released   2002    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Funimation, Tubi    
.hack//SIGN is an important isekai anime that established many tropes that are foundational to the genre. The series established the formula later codified by hits like Sword Art Online of having a cast of characters stuck in an MMO world and trying to get out. Arguably more so than any of its successors though, .hack does interesting things with this premise as it builds a genuinely interesting mystery around why people are trapped in its game world. The series&#39; increased emphasis on mystery and introspection might not appeal to every isekai fan, but those who are curious will probably be hooked. Fortunately for anyone looking into watching this seminal isekai anime, it&#39;s currently streaming for free on Tubi.





 11  Sonny Boy 
Original Anime Series Created By Shingo Natsume &amp; Studio Madhouse
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
More so than almost any other anime, Sonny Boy shows off the wide and deep potential of isekai. The series follows a group of high school students who are mysteriously transported to a black void, and then to an island, while they develop special powers. What sets Sonny Boy apart is its introspective nature and its outright refusal to be anything close to wish fulfillment. The young protagonists might be freed from the pressures adults place on them, but that pressure is replaced with a far deeper uneasiness. The result is mind-blowing in a way all the best fantasy anime are. Though Sonny Boy might be a different take on isekai anime, its one well worth seeking out on Crunchyroll.





 10  Campfire Cooking in Another World With My Absurd Skill 
Based on the Light Novel By Ren Eguchi
        

  Year Released   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
Animated by the legendary studio MAPPA, Campfire Cooking in Another World With My Absurd Skill is a gorgeously produced series that provides a cozy, refreshing spin on isekai. The series follows Tsuyoshi Mukouda, a salaryman who accidentally gets summoned into another world to defend the Kingdom of Reijseger against their foes. In a twist, Mukouda talks his way out of being the Kingdom&#39;s hero because his out-of-battle skill, &#34;Online Supermarket,&#34; is deemed virtually useless.
As a result, Mukouda takes up life as a merchant and adventurer, discovering that his skill is anything but useless. He&#39;s able to whip up a variety of dishes which eventually catches the attention of a mythical wolf named Fel, and the pair negotiate a partnership wherein Fel will become Mukouda&#39;s familiar in exchange for more food. While nothing groundbreaking, Campfire Cooking in Another World With My Absurd Skill is immensely entertaining from start to finish and never takes itself too seriously.





 9  Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion 
Based on the Web Novel By Milcha
  Year Released   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
Providing a unique twist on the concept of &#34;being born into another world,&#34; Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion follows Rinko Hanasaki after being reborn as a minor character from a novel named Raeliana McMillan, the eldest daughter of a baron who lived a relatively carefree life until she is eventually killed by her fiancé, Francis Brooks. With this knowledge, Raeliana is determined to break off her engagement with Lord Brooks and seeks help from the main protagonist of the novel – Duke Noah Wynknight.
Remembering everything about him from the book, she proposes a deal to the Duke: she won&#39;t reveal his secrets if he takes her as his fiancé. A romance with an intriguing mystery surrounding its male lead, Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion succeeds in delivering a heart-pounding story that forces audiences to keep him at arm&#39;s length up until the very end.





 8  The Eminence in Shadow 
Based on the Light Novel Created By Daisuke Aizawa &amp; Tōzai
        

  Year Released   2022    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   HiDive    
The Eminence in Shadow follows Minoru Kageno – a young man obsessed with the idea of becoming stronger than anybody else. This need for power doesn&#39;t stem from a desire for recognition or a feeling of inadequacy, in fact, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. After a tragic truck accident, Minoru is convinced in his dying moments that his ambitions have been thwarted, that is, until he wakes up as a noble child named Cid in a world where magic is commonplace.
The Eminence in Shadow&#39;s storyprides itself on being edgy as a means to elevate its comedic moments and succeeds in every possible way. With his ability to use magic, Cid finally has the power he so longed for in his previous life. He dons the moniker &#34;Shadow&#34; and forms a group called the Shadow Garden that fights back against the fictional Cult of Diablos – a group that Cid has seemingly made up. Intriguing while never taking itself too seriously, The Eminence in Shadow is the perfect tongue-in-cheek comedy isekai for fans of traditionally &#34;edgy&#34; content.





 7  Uncle from Another World 
Based on the Manga Created By Hotondoshindeiru
        

  Year Released   2022    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Netflix    
Technically classified as a reverse isekai, Uncle from Another World is an underrated comedy series that gives a glimpse into what happens when somebody who&#39;s been transported to another world comes home. After being in a coma for seventeen years, Takafumi Takaoka&#39;s uncle, Yosuke &#34;Ojisan&#34; Shibazaki, regains consciousness and begins to recount his adventures in the magical world of Granbahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle&#39;s stories until he witnesses him use magic, which inspires the pair to start a YouTube channel showcasing his abilities from his other life.
Additionally, Takafumi is tasked with getting his uncle caught up on everything that&#39;s changed in the world in the last seventeen years. Everything from the modern internet to the results of the infamous &#39;90s console war are treated as earth-shattering world developments. While absurdist at times, Uncle from Another World&#39;s fresh look at what could potentially happen when an isekai protagonist&#39;s journey comes to an end is nothing short of hilarious, making it the perfect summer binge-watch.





 6  My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!  
Based on the Light Novel Created By Satoru Yamaguchi &amp; Nami Hidaka
        

  Year Released   2020    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
Growing up as a young noble, Catarina Claes suddenly regains all her memories from her past life after an accident in her family&#39;s home. She realizes that she&#39;s been reborn as the main antagonist of her favorite dating sim, Fortune Lover, and that she&#39;s fated to die in every possible ending of the story. Using her knowledge of the game&#39;s events, Catarina is determined to try and change her fate, unaware that the choices she&#39;s making are affecting everyone else&#39;s stories, too.
My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! is an expressive and charming romantic comedy, sporting a large cast of lovable characters and an even more lovable protagonist. Catarina, despite trying her best, is rather aloof and fails to realize just how important she is to the people around her, believing that her tragic fate could be lurking around every corner.





 5  Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation 
Based on the Light Novel Created By Rifujin na Magonote
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   36 &#43; 1 OVA    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
With season 2 currently airing as part of the Summer 2023 seasonal anime releases, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation has been heralded as one of the best isekai series to date. Following the life of Rudeus Greyrat, Mushoku Tensei tells the story of somebody who was irredeemable in his past life, born into a new world with the hopes of becoming a powerful adventurer.
Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation is gorgeously animated, showcasing a lush fantasy world and a robust cast of supporting characters that Rudeus bonds with throughout his life. Part of what makes this series so unique amidst similar isekai anime is that it shows every key moment from Rudeus&#39; life, with the story beginning when he&#39;s an infant. Showcasing such a deep level of development makes it easy to connect with Rudeus despite his many flaws and immerses audiences in the world as it develops.





 4  Ya Boy Kongming!  
Based on the Manga Created By Yuto Yotsuba &amp; Ryō Ogawa
        

  Year Released   2022    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   HiDive    
Despite its bizarre premise, Ya Boy Kongming! is an infectiously fun and unorthodox isekai that has something for everyone. Zhuge Kongming, a former chancellor of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Period, wishes to be reborn into an era of peace and finds himself in modern-day Shibuya on Halloween. He meets an aspiring musician named Eiko Tsukimi, and inspired by her music, helps her pursue her dreams.
While vastly different from a typical isekai in that it lacks magical powers or any other traditional fantasy elements, Ya Boy Kongming! is incredibly fun, taking advantage of its absurd setup to tell a genuinely heartfelt story about pursuing one&#39;s dreams. The style and charm of this series make it one of the best anime that the genre has to offer.





 3  Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World 
Based on the Light Novel Series Created By Tappei Nagatsuki &amp; Shin&#39;ichirō Ōtsuka
        

  Year Released   2016    Number of Episodes   50    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
Suddenly transported to another world after leaving a supermarket, Subaru Natsuki attempts to navigate this mysterious new place, anxious and alone. He&#39;s quickly attacked by a group of thugs. He&#39;s saved suddenly by a girl named Emilia, who&#39;s searching for an insignia that was stolen from her. In their search, the pair are hunted and tragically murdered. That&#39;s when Subaru reawakens in front of the thugs once again and is suspiciously rescued by Emilia in the exact same way he was before.
As Re:Zero progresses, Subaru realizes that this mysterious power can help him just as much as it harms him. While initially presenting itself as a rather standard isekai, Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World quickly develops into something much more intriguing – and oftentimes gruesome – than audiences could ever anticipate. Subaru&#39;s endless suffering in trying to find the best outcome for each situation creates uncomfortable tension as stakes rise, making it one of the best isekai anime for fans of the genre.





 2  That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime 
Based on the Light Novel Series Created By Fuse &amp; Mitz Vah


 







  Year Released   2018    Number of Episodes   48 &#43; 5 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu    
Everyman corporate office worker Satoru Mikami is perfectly content with his mundane Tokyo lifestyle, despite never being able to get a girlfriend. After an encounter with one of his work colleagues, Satoru is stabbed on the streets by a stranger. Succumbing to his injuries, Satoru wakes up as a slime monster in an unknown world. After befriending and offering aid to a Catastrophe-level monster named the Storm Dragon Veldora, Satoru is given the name Rimuru Tempest and sets out on an adventure.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is a relatively standard isekai, and while it doesn&#39;t break any major genre conventions, it&#39;s a fun series that follows a new life of freedom granted to somebody who was already rather content, which does give the series a humble look at the expansive fantasy world it takes place in.





 1  KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing On This Wonderful World 
Based on the Light Novel Series By Natsume Akatsuki


 







  Year Released   2016    Number of Episodes   20 &#43; 2 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
After dying on his way home from buying a video game, high school shut-in Kazuma Satou awakens to find himself sitting in front of a beautiful yet annoying goddess named Aqua. She offers him two choices: he can either move on to the afterlife or be reborn into a fantasy world. Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma is quickly swept on a typical quest to defeat the Devil King plaguing the world. Before he begins his journey, he&#39;s allowed to select any item to take with him. Believing he&#39;d beat the system, he chooses Aqua, only to realize that she&#39;s completely useless.
With a genre that feels as oversaturated as isekai, it can be refreshing to find a series that pokes fun at everything the genre stands for. KonoSuba accomplishes this by taking every opportunity to not just poke fun at the many tired tropes that plague isekai, but by making fun of its main characters, turning them into walking parodies of isekai&#39;s most beloved archetypes.
Isekai is truly a diverse genre with an incredible breadth of different stories to tell. Though some fans of anime might find the genre same-y because of the genre&#39;s most famous examples, that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Isekai anime is so popular because it&#39;s able to appeal to so many different groups of people. The premise of a person being transported to a magic world has so much potential, and the best isekai anime all take advantage of that to tell incredible stories.
