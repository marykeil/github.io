## Literature Review

Wolverine #41 sees the brutal Sabretooth War finally kick off, as Victor Creed hits Wolverine where it hurts most, murdering members of his family.




Warning: contains spoilers for Wolverine #41Marvel just released one of its most R-Rated X-Men issues in history, as the vile Sabretooth murderously brutalizes the loved ones of his archenemy Wolverine in Wolverine #41. While Victor Creed has almost always operated as a sadistic psychopathic villain, he has had brief moments of antiheroic behavior, but that time is bloodily coming to an end as Creed brings the Sabretooth War to Logan&#39;s front door.




Creed recently escaped the clutches of Orchis and his multiversal son Graydon Creed by partnering with a team of monstrous variant Sabretooths, a group Earth-616&#39;s Sabretooth is now leading and hoped to use to slaughter Krakoa&#39;s Quiet Council for their treatment of him.

          

Wolverine #41, from writers Victor LaValle and Benjamin Percy with artists Geoff Shaw and Cory Smith, sees Sabretooth and his crew of variants brutally killing and cannibalizing Wolverine&#39;s young teammate Kid Omega after discovering the abandoned Krakoa, and also horrifically killing his biological son Akihiro.


 Sabretooth&#39;s R-Rated Murders Of Akihiro And Quentin Are Devastating 
          




In Wolverine #41 a shape-shifting Sabretooth variant lures Quentin in just close enough to murder him with a fake set of Logan&#39;s claws, meaning the last thing Kid Omega saw before his death was Wolverine&#39;s face, a horrific sight for the still-young hero. Later, on the night of Logan&#39;s birthday, Sabretooth and his team approach X-Force&#39;s new Antarctic base and slaughter numerous mutant refugees, before engaging in a bloody battle with Akihiro that ends in Wolverine&#39;s son&#39;s death. Even more horribly, Victor then arranged Akihiro and his other victims&#39; bodies to spell out &#34;Happy Birthday,&#34; psychopathically torturing Wolverine with the death of his son that he was helpless to prevent.

          

Sabretooth killing anyone that Logan is close to would anger Wolverine to no end, but it&#39;s Victor&#39;s slaughter of Quentin and Akihiro that makes the first strike of the Sabretooth War so devastating. Quentin Quire and Logan have been teammates on X-Force throughout the Krakoan Age, and Black Tom even hints that Wolverine considers Quentin to be an adopted son of his, calling Quire one of Wolverine&#39;s &#34;pups.&#34; Even more heartbreaking, while the relationship between Akihiro and Logan started violent and filled with hatred, they have made great strides in forming a respectful and even loving relationship. The two have come a long way since Akihiro was a villain trying to murder Logan, and their burgeoning father-son relationship was beautiful, and now tragic, to witness.






 Wolverine&#39;s Brutal War Against Sabretooth Is Only Just Beginning 
          

For decades now Sabretooth has kept the tradition of hunting down Wolverine on his birthday to do bloody battle with him, always sparing his life but beating him enough to prove his strength over Logan. However, this tradition stopped in recent years, and Wolverine grew more complacent than he should have, knowing that Victor is a manipulative and terrifyingly resilient man. Logan is fiercely protective of those he loves, and his &#34;Snikt Family&#34; has become his home in the past few years, so Victor&#39;s murder of Akihiro and Quentin will surely spiral Wolverine into a berserker rage.

The Sabretooth War is a 10-part event that will conclude Percy&#39;s epic 50-issue run of Wolverine, and the centuries-in-the-making war between the two feral fighters will only grow more violent and brutal. While the X-Men are out fighting the oppressive forces of Orchis Wolverine will be stuck battling an old enemy, and hopefully stopping Sabretooth from harming anyone else who he loves.




Wolverine #41 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
