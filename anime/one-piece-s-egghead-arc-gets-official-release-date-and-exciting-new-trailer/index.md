## Literature Review

Following the end of the Wano arc in the One Piece anime, a new trailer has been released to announce the official start of the Egghead Island arc.




One Piece’s Egghead Island arc is the first official arc to follow the Wano arc and the first arc in One Piece’s final saga. With how long the Wano arc went on, many people were more than ready for a new story by the time it came to an end, and so far, the Egghead Island arc has been seen as a welcome change of pace for the series.




The Egghead Island arc is shaping up to be One Piece’s biggest arc yet, full of shocking revelations and clarifications about mysteries that are by now decades-old, and there’s finally an official release date for its anime adaptation. Following the conclusion of the Wano arc in episode #1085, a trailer for One Piece’s Egghead Island arc was released that revealed the official start date as January 7, 2024.

          

That start date makes sense with the material that needs to be adapted before the Egghead Island arc, but more than that, the trailer does a great job of showcasing what people can expect from the arc on an aesthetic level, and that sets it up to be one of the anime’s best adaptations yet.

 One Piece’s Egghead Island Arc Won’t Start Until 2024 

 

Since the Wano arc just ended, it might seem odd that One Piece’s Egghead Island arc won’t start until 2024, but it makes perfect sense. The One Piece anime adapts the manga at a rate of roughly one chapter per episode, and One Piece’s Egghead Island arc doesn’t truly start until chapter #1061, four chapters after the end of the Wano arc in the manga. Add in how the anime will likely take a break for New Year’s, as is common, and 2024 is the only reasonable start date for the anime adaptation of One Piece’s Egghead Island arc.

 One Piece’s Egghead Arc Gives The Anime Another New Style 
          




Officially titled &#34;Egg Head Arc&#34;, this new part of the One Piece anime will bring another change in the overall aesthetic of the series, as seen from the trailer. Fitting the retro-futuristic style of Egghead Island, the Egghead Island arc trailer depicts the characters in a very light art style against partially 3D backgrounds, and the soundtrack appears to be using a techno style the likes of which has never appeared in the anime before. It’s a wholly natural progression of what’s been done in the manga, and it’s bound to lend itself to great animation for One Piece’s Egghead Island arc and overall presentation in the weeks to come.

All of that, of course, is an excellent continuation of what the Wano arc did for the anime. The Wano arc gave the anime a much-needed overhaul in art and animation that made it one of the best-looking anime to watch, and for the first time in years, the One Piece anime started being held in as high regard as the manga. The Egghead Island arc looks like it will keep to that same standards and have One Piece continue to be one of the most visually appealing anime to watch.
