  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Every anime fan knows and loves Studio Ghibli movies or popular titles like Your Name, but these underrated movies deserve to be appreciated as well.</p>
<p>Anime movies have recently become an increasingly popular industry, with titles like Your Name and A Silent Voice taking the world by storm. However, those willing to look into the most underrated anime movies are sure to be rewarded with entertaining and memorable experiences that, for some reason or another, were unable to gain as much traction as they deserve.
From light-hearted romances to serious adventures and touching dramas, anime movies can follow just about any topic and tell any story. More often than not, underrated anime movies tend to tell stories that, due to their simple premise and setting, are likely to be dismissed as generic or unoriginal. Yet those who overlook these titles are sure to miss out on some of the medium&rsquo;s best hidden gems.</p>
<p>10  Penguin Highway (2018)
Produced by Studio Colorido, Based on the Novel by Tomihiko Morimi, &amp; Directed by Hiroyasu Ishida</p>
<p>Despite only being in elementary school, Aoyama is a true genius, boasting knowledge and research skills that can rival those of most adults. When penguins suddenly begin showing up in his neighborhood, which should be impossible given its distance from the sea, Aoyama is determined to learn more about this mysterious event and solve the riddle behind it. To this end, he embarks on a life-changing adventure with Lady, a friendly woman who works at a dental office, and the two eventually discover an enigmatic levitating sphere to which the penguins seem to be linked.
Penguin Highway tells a colorful, imaginative story about growing up and facing the world&rsquo;s many curiosities. Relying on ambiguous metaphors and uncertain symbolism, much of the story is left up to interpretation, which some viewers might appreciate, while others might not. Likewise, the peculiar characters, most of whom are grade schoolers, often try to act more mature than they are, which tends to prove quite endearing. The movie also shines in terms of visuals and music, featuring vibrant colors and memorable music.
Tomihiko Morimi, the author of the Penguing Highway novel, also created titles such as The Tatami Galaxy, The Eccentric Family, and Night Is Short, Walk on Girl, which received likewise remarkable anime adaptations.</p>

<p>9  Belle (2021)
Original Movie Produced by Studio Chizu &amp; Directed by Mamoru Hosoda</p>
<p>Suzu Naitou is a high school girl who lives with her father in the rural town of Koichi. Although Suzu once loved to sing, the unexpected death of her mother and the distance she put between herself and the rest of the world made it difficult for her to sing again. However, after discovering &ldquo;U&rdquo;, an online world where anyone can live a new life as the avatar of their choice, Suzu finds that she has regained her ability to sing, as Belle. Belle&rsquo;s beautiful voice soon attracts the attention of many, including that of &ldquo;The Dragon&rdquo;, a mysterious beast.
Loosely inspired by the Beauty and the Beast French fairy tale, and featuring a protagonist that was drawn by veteran Disney character designer Jin Kim, Belle tells an important tale of self-discovery and acceptance, which manages to feel simultaneously familiar yet refreshing. Beyond the emotional story and realistic character, the movie also distinguishes itself through incredible animation that effortlessly mixes 2D with 3D scenes, and some of the medium&rsquo;s best music, which should be expected given the protagonist&rsquo;s passion for singing.
Mamoru Hosoda, the creator and director behind Belle, is best known for his other brilliant films, including Summer Wars, The Boy and the Beast, and Wolf Children.</p>

<p>8  Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011)
Original Movie Produced by CoMix Wave Films &amp; Directed by Makoto Shinkai</p>
<p>Having lost her father at a young age and living only with a mother who spends most of her time at work, Asuna Watase was forced to grow up quickly and learn to take care of herself. When she&rsquo;s not studying or doing chores, Asuna spends most of her free time with her pet cat Mimi, listening to the mysterious music of an old crystal radio. One day, as she is suddenly attacked by a strange monster and saved by a peculiar stranger, Asuna finds herself thrown on a long journey to a legendary land beneath Earth.
Children Who Chase Lost Voice takes viewers on an emotionally charged adventure set in a beautiful, intricate world. The ambitious story may result in certain elements feeling comparatively underdeveloped, but the scale of the world, which is brought to life by amazing animation and an impressive soundtrack, makes this film unmissable for fans of adventure titles. Despite being a movie directed and created by Makoto Shinkai, it seems to take a page from Studio Ghibli instead, departing from the auteur&rsquo;s usual style.
Fans are more likely to be familiar with Makoto Shinkai&rsquo;s more famous creations, such as Weathering with You, Your Name., and the more recent Suzume.</p>

<p>7  Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop (2021)
Original Movie Produced by Signal.MD and Sublimation &amp; Directed by Kyouhei Ishiguro</p>
<p>Cherry is a quiet but creative boy who expresses himself best through written haikus, while Smile is an aspiring influencer who, despite trying to make everyone smile, hides her own face with a mask due to insecurities related to her braces. After these two unlikely friends end up accidentally crossing each other&rsquo;s paths, they soon end up working at the same facility at a shopping mall. Prompted by Fujiyama, a senile old man&rsquo;s desire to recover one of his long-lost vinyl records, Cherry and Smile undertake a hunt that is about to redefine their summer.
Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop tells a vibrant and charming coming-of-age story about two adolescents coming to terms with their insecurities. The story is far from special, with countless similar variations already existing in some form or another, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less endearing. The simple yet realistic characters are designed in such a way that fans can&rsquo;t help but love them, and the colorful animation goes a long way in defining the movie&rsquo;s identity, making this one of the best Netflix anime movies.

All in all, this movie provides an original experience that simply cannot be found anywhere else.</p>

While distraught by the idea of borrowing someone else&rsquo;s body, Makoto eventually realizes that people are too complex and colorful, to the point where it may become difficult to distinguish one&rsquo;s own colors from those that surround them.
Colorful: The Motion Picture is a moving drama that tactfully explores a variety of important themes, ranging from the value of life to the importance of finding joy in every little thing. Grounded, relatable, and effortlessly beautiful, this title is likely to prove healing to viewers who have previously struggled with depression and life&rsquo;s often unnecessary complexity.

Determined to put his life back together, Kaoru returns to the entrance later, followed by Anzu Hanashiro, a mysterious transfer student with a wish of her own.
