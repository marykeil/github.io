## Literature Review

Isekai fans who are looking for something formulaic won&#39;t get that with Samurai in Another World, but it still scratches that itch more than others.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for Samurai in Another World chapter 5.






Samurai in Another World is a manga by Keigo Saitou.




A new isekai manga called Samurai in Another World combines ancient Japan with fantasy in what can essentially be considered a double Isekai. This explosive recipe revolutionizes the popular isekai genre by lacking a real-world, modern version of Earth, and it works.

Isekai&#39;s initial appeal has always been to allow readers to live vicariously through the protagonist&#39;s ability to escape from reality, since the protagonist always comes from a similar world as the reader, and gets isekai&#39;d into a fantasy realm.

          




The most popular spin on this formula is the reverse Isekai, where the protagonist is originally from a fantasy world and gets transported to modern-day Earth, usually for comedic effect. Samurai in Another World clearly doesn&#39;t follow any of these blueprints, and embarks on an incredibly unique journey.


 Ancient Japanese &amp; Fantasy Worlds Are the Perfect Mix For Multiple Reasons 
         

Originally created by Keigo Saitou, Samurai in Another World isn&#39;t just effective because modern-day Earth isn&#39;t even part of the equation. The fantasy isekai world is a perfect match for the series&#39; eponymous samurai named Ginko because of what time period she comes from. Her world has molded her to the point where her dreams can only be achieved in such a distinctive place as a fantasy realm like the one she gets isekai&#39;d to. Ginko is a product of the Warring States period, during the height of the samurai. As a samurai herself, she desires the honorable death of a warrior, but no one is even a match for her, making her desperate. A fantasy realm like the one she gets transported to is like heaven to her, since it&#39;s filled with demons, orcs, and dragons who are naturally much stronger than even the most gifted samurai.




This compelling setup naturally appears to create a clear path for Samurai in Another World to follow. The moment Ginko appears in this magical world, she gets excited and starts slaughtering various monsters â€“ a past that she will gladly participate in for as long as possible. Even though it would be enjoyable to watch her go up against bigger and more powerful monsters, the series immediately provides some much-welcomed twists that add more layers to the story. The biggest of them is that this fantasy world has heroes who are the saviors of humankind, and at least one of them is unpleasant enough that she is clearly dead set on giving this new visitor the opposite of a warm welcome for once stealing her thunder. Additionally, Ginko&#39;s aimless wanderings to find a more powerful monster later gain more of a distinctive purpose when she learns of specific demons that have harmed some new friends of hers whereby killing them would break their curses on them.

          




However, one goal reigns supreme over these various obstacles for Ginko, and it&#39;s one that the series is clearly leading up to: the slaying of a mythical dragon. The fact that Ginko has a brief encounter with one that doesn&#39;t end satisfactorily enough means Ginko now has a set mission for readers to look forward to. So, even though the &#34;double isekai&#34; effect is the Samurai in Another World&#39;s main appeal, Ginko&#39;s masterful introduction of additional threats and allies are already boosting what would clearly make an utterly promising anime.
