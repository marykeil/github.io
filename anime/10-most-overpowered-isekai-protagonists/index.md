## Literature Review

Whether they keep their skills from their past lives or are granted special abilities by the gods, these isekai protagonists are unmatched in power.




Whether they have memories or skills from their past lives to rely on, unique abilities granted to them by the gods who brought them to their new world, or bodies with an uncommonly high aptitude for magic, isekai protagonists almost always find themselves to be significantly stronger than their peers. Moreover, their innate strength is usually also paired with an incredible talent for evolution.
One of the more recent trends in the anime landscape is the increasingly popular isekai theme, which refers to stories wherein characters are reborn or otherwise transported to worlds vastly different from their own. When given a new chance at life, they can choose to approach this situation in a myriad of ways, though they often tend to be given an advantage. Having an overpowered main character has become a staple of the isekai genre, and here are ten protagonists who stand out even among this impressive crowd.









 








 10  Lugh Tuatha Dé Has the Skills of Two Lives 
The World&#39;s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat

        

The World&#39;s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat makes its premise quite clear from its title. A man who is known as the world&#39;s greatest assassin is granted the chance to be reborn into a noble family of assassins in a world of magic, with the goddess giving him this opportunity in exchange for him promising to use his skills to take out the hero. Combining the knowledge and experience he gained in his previous life with the magic and techniques acquired in his new world, Lugh Tuatha Dé easily proves himself to be an assassin of unrivaled talent.





 9  Yuna&#39;s Bear Strength Can Achieve Anything 
Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear
        

As a low-stakes lighthearted show, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear might seem unlikely to feature an overpowered protagonist. However, that&#39;s exactly what Yuna is. After fervently playing a VRMMO known as World Fantasy Online for a year, she receives a bear costume from the game&#39;s administrators. Yet as soon as she accepts it, she finds herself transported into the video game world, wearing the bear suit she was given. Thanks to her overpowered yet strange-looking suit, she finds herself taking on powerful monsters and achieving feats thought to be impossible with ease, which is how she also gains the nickname of &#34;Bloody Bear&#34;.

 6  Cid Kagenou Hides His True Power 
The Eminence in Shadow


 







Although he never wanted to stand out, Minoru Kagenou has always been obsessed with becoming as strong as possible, training and studying every day. After dying in an accident and being reborn as Cid Kagenou in a world of magic, he finally gets the chance to play the role he&#39;s always wanted: that of the antihero. Compared to most other similar shows, The Eminence in Shadow stands out because of its protagonist who, rather than openly boasting about his skills, spends most of his time and energy by pretending to be a weak &#34;mob&#34;, only so that he can make his grandiose entrances as the &#34;eminence in shadows.&#34; Cid also becomes the leader of an underground organization operating from the shadows, fighting a cult that he thought existed only in his imagination, not realizing the threat he&#39;s up against.

 5  Shishou Is A Literal Living Weapon 
Reincarnated as a Sword
        

While most isekai protagonists are brave warriors or peerless wizards, Reincarnated as a Sword follows, as one would guess, a sword. Despite this sword being able to move and fight mighty beasts by itself, absorbing their cores and gaining their abilities in the process, it ends up stuck in a mana-depleting zone. As Fran, a black cat beastkin and former slave, passes by, the sword, hereafter named &#34;Shishou&#34;, calls out to her, and they save each other in the process. While Shishou was already powerful by himself, pairing up with Fran only boosts the duo&#39;s strength further. Moreover, their evolution is impressive and extremely enjoyable to watch.

 4  Seika Lamprogue Brings Power From a Past Life 
The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World
        

The difference between The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World and most other isekai is that the protagonist Haruyoshi brought about his own reincarnation, as opposed to it happening accidentally or at the whims of some god. Despite being the strongest onmyouji in history, he was the victim of a classic anime betrayal, which is why he decided to be more cunning and calculating in his next life. Reborn as Seika Lamprogue in a new world, his family ignores him because of his inability to use magic, but he has secretly kept the exorcist techniques he spent his entire life mastering, as well as his pacts with powerful supernatural beings.

 3  Seiya Ryuuguuin Never Holds Back 
Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered, But Overly Cautious
        

Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered But Overly Cautious lays all of its cards on the table from the offset. The story follows Seiya Ryuuguuin, a hero who was summoned by goddess Ristarte to save the world of Gaeabrande. Although Seiya is extremely powerful, his overly wary nature causes him to excessively prepare for everything; even when fighting the weakest of enemies, he still goes all out, using his strongest skills and stocking up on potions and spare armor, just to be on the safe side. While this isekai story&#39;s protagonist is just as strong as any other, the emphasis of the show lies on the comedy of his situation.
