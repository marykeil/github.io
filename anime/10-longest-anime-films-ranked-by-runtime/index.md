## Literature Review

Anime films make up some of the longest animated films of all time, and these are the 10 films that hold the longest runtimes of all time.




One major factor that effects films, animated or otherwise, is their runtime. A film&#39;s runtime can be seen as either a positive or a negative depending on how well the story develops, and regardless of quality, a film having an especially long runtime can end up as a neat bit of trivia, and it can even be used to sell the film to certain people.
How long a film&#39;s runtime can get is always an interesting area of discussion, and anime films are no different in that regard. While it&#39;s common for anime films to have shorter runtimes, especially if they&#39;re spin-offs of anime adaptations in the 80s or 90s, there are plenty of anime films that end up with incredibly lengthy runtimes, to the point that anime films make up the majority of longest animated films.
        

It&#39;s a fascinating statistic to think about, and overall, it adds a lot to the reputation of some already great films.









 








 10  Great Conquest: The Romance Of The Three Kingdoms Part 2: The Yangtze River Burns! (1993) 
Runtime: 149 Minutes
        

  Release Date   March 18, 1993    Director   Tomoharu Katsumata    Cast   Teruhiko Aoi, Hidekatsu Shibata, Hideyuki Hori, Iemasa Kayumi, Takashi Yamaguchi    Runtime   149 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Currently Unavailable    
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is one of the most oft-adapted novels in history, and a noteworthy example is Toei Animation&#39;s animated film trilogy. The three films were released from 1992 to 1994, and the second film, 1993&#39;s Great Conquest: The Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 2: The Yangtze River Burns!, stands out as the tenth-longest anime film of all time with a runtime of 149 minutes. The films are also notable for being one of the few starring roles of Teruhiko Aoi, best known for playing Joe Yabuki in Ashita no Joe, as Aoi starred as Liu Bei across all three films.





 9  Star Driver: The Movie (2013) 
Runtime: 150 Minutes
        

  Release Date   February 9, 2013    Director   Takuya Igarashi    Cast   Mamoru Miyano, Jun Fukuyama, Saori Hayami    Runtime   150 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
Compilation films make up many of the longest animated films, and one of the longest is 2013&#39;s Star Driver: The Movie. Star Driver: The Movie is an adaptation of the cult hit mecha anime of the same name, and at 150 minutes, it stands out as the ninth-longest anime film of all time. As a compilation film, Star Driver: The Movie doesn&#39;t change much of the original story, although it does have a few scenes to expand on what happened to the cast after the anime, and with how hammy and over-the-top Star Driver is, there&#39;s still plenty of merit in seeing a condensed version of all of that, regardless.





 8  Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A&#39;s (2012) 
Runtime: 150 Minutes


 







  Release Date   July 14, 2012    Director   Keizou Kusakawa    Cast   Yukari Tamura, Nana Mizuki, Kana Ueda, Kaori Mizuhashi, Sanae Kobayashi    Runtime   150 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
As the name would imply, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A’s is an adaptation of season 2 of the original anime, and with a runtime of 150 minutes, it serves as the eighth-longest anime film of all time. Like the previous Nanoha film, it makes numerous changes to the anime&#39;s story, most notably by cutting out some of the side characters to tighten the plot, so old and new fans alike can watch it and get a wholly unique experience out of it.

 7  Farewell To Space Battleship Yamato (1978) 
Runtime: 151 Minutes
        

  Release Date   July 14, 1978    Directors   Leiji Matsumoto, Toshio Masuda, Tomoharu Katsumata    Cast   Kei Tomoyama, Yoko Asagami, Akira Kamiya, Bin Shimada, Chikao Ohtsuka    Runtime   151 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
Leiji Matsumoto’s Space Battleship Yamato is one of the biggest science fiction franchises in all of anime, and one of its most infamous entries is its second film, 1978&#39;s Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato. The film was a sequel to 1977&#39;s Space Battleship Yamato: The Movie, and with a runtime of 151 minutes, Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato is the seventh-longest anime film of all time. The film was infamous for killing off the majority of the cast to the point that a sequel to the original anime, Space Battleship Yamato II, retconned most of the film, and the events of the film have largely been ignored since.





 6  Ashita No Joe: The Movie (1980) 
Runtime: 152 Minutes
        

  Release Date   March 8, 1980    Directors   Osamu Dezaki, Yoichiro Fukuda    Cast   Teruhiko Aoi, Jukei Fujioka, Toku Nishio, Kazuko Nishizawa, Toshiyuki Hosokawa    Runtime   152 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Amazon Prime    
Another compilation film to have an especially long runtime is 1980&#39;s Ashita no Joe: The Movie. Licensed in the West as Champion Joe, the film abridges the original Ashita no Joe anime, and with a runtime of 152 minutes, Ashita no Joe: The Movie is the sixth-longest anime film of all time. The film was followed up with a second season of the anime appropriately titled Ashita no Joe 2, which also received a compilation film of the same name, but with a runtime of only 114 minutes, it ranks far lower on the list of longest anime films and longest animated films.

 5  Evangelion: 3.0&#43;1.0 Thrice Upon A Time (2021) 
Runtime: 155 Minutes


 







  Release Date   March 8, 2021    Directors   Hideaki Anno, Kazuya Tsurumaki, Katsuichi Nakayama, Mahiro Maeda    Cast   Spike Spencer, Tiffany Grant, Amanda Winn-Lee, Deneen Melody, John Swasey    Runtime   155 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Amazon Prime    
From 2007 to 2021, Hideaki Anno&#39;s Neon Genesis Evangelion was remade into the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy, and the longest of them was the final film, 2021’s Evangelion: 3.0&#43;1.0 Thrice Upon a Time. As the grand finale to both the Rebuild series and Evangelion, as a whole, Thrice Upon a Time naturally had a lot of ground to cover, so it makes sense that it would need a long runtime to close everything out. When it was finally released, Evangelion: 3.0&#43;1.0 Thrice Upon a Time ended up with a runtime of 155 minutes, making it the fifth-longest anime film of all time.

 4  Great Conquest: The Romance Of The Three Kingdoms Part 3: The Distant Land (1994) 
Runtime: 157 Minutes
        

  Release Date   April 29, 1994    Director   Tomoharu Katsumata    Cast   Teruhiko Aoi, Chikao Ohtsuka, Banjo Ginga, Takashi Yamaguchi    Runtime   157 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
It was already discussed that The Yangtze River Burns! is one of the longest anime films of all time, and that&#39;s also true of its sequel, 1994&#39;s Great Conquest: The Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 3: The Distant Land. The film concluded the Great Conquest trilogy, and with a runtime of 157 minutes, Great Conquest: The Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 3: The Distant Land is the fourth-longest anime film of all time. The Great Conquest trilogy might not be the most iconic adaptation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but the length of the films has still allowed them to leave a mark on the medium, regardless.





 3  The Disappearance Of Haruhi Suzumiya (2010) 
Runtime: 162 Minutes


 







  Release Date   February 6, 2010    Directors   Tatsuya Ishihara, Yasuhiro Takemoto    Cast   Crispin Freeman, Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, Stephanie Sheh, Johnny Yong Bosch    Runtime   162 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was one of the biggest anime in the world in the 2000s, and its sequel film, 2010&#39;s The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, was appropriately big, as well. The film adapted the light novel of the same name, and with a runtime of 162 minutes, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is the third-longest anime film of all time. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya also ended up being the grand finale of the anime, as no new episodes for the main series have been produced since, and with its impeccable writing and direction, it’s an all-around great anime film that more than earned its lengthy runtime.

 2  Final Yamato (1983) 
Runtime: 163 Minutes
        

  Release Date   November 5, 1983    Directors   Takeshi Shirato, Tomoharu Katsumata, Yoshinobu Nishizaki    Cast   Kei Tomiyama, Yoko Asagami, Goro Naya, Akira Kamiya, Masato Ibu    Runtime   163 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
The films in the Space Battleship Yamato franchise are known for their lengthy runtimes, and 1983&#39;s Final Yamato is no exception. As the title would imply, Final Yamato was the grand finale of the anime before Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection and various remakes and sequels, finished or otherwise, Final Yamato&#39;s 70mm cut boasts a massive runtime of 163 minutes, making it the second-longest anime film of all time. What&#39;s especially noteworthy about Final Yamato&#39;s runtime is that it was unsurpassed by any animated film until 2019, so for almost 40 years, Final Yamato had the prestige of being the longest anime film of all time.





 1  In This Corner (And Other Corners) Of The World (2019) 
Runtime: 168 Minutes
        

  Release Date   December 20, 2019    Director   Sunao Katabuchi    Cast   Laura Post, Todd Haberkorn, Barbara Goodson, Kirk Thornton, Karen Strassman    Runtime   168 Minutes    Where To Watch It   Unavailable    
The film that stands out as the longest anime film of all time is 2019&#39;s In This Corner (and Other Corners) of the World. The Studio MAPPA film is an extended cut of 2016&#39;s In This Corner of the World that expanded on the relationships between some of the principal characters and the World War II themes, and with a runtime of 168 minutes, In This Corner (and Other Corners) of the World is both the longest anime film and longest animated film of all time. It’s an achievement that the film more than earned, and its status as the longest anime film is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.
