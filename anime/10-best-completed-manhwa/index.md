## Literature Review

For fans who are tired of cliffhangers and unexpected hiatuses, completed manhwa provide uncompromising experiences and satisfying conclusions.




As enjoyable as it may be to follow ongoing manhwa, keeping up with new chapters and wondering what could happen next, it also comes with certain risks, such as the possibility of a title being canceled too soon or of the story taking an unpleasant turn that ruins the experience. As such, many fans may instead prefer to read the best completed manhwa first, before seeking out new and uncertain adventures.
In a medium as broad and varied as the manhwa one, there is a title for everyone, whether one prefers familiar tropes polished to perfection or one-of-a-kind tales that follow unique journeys set in fantastical worlds. From lighthearted titles that provide relaxing or comedic experiences to emotionally impactful ones that will cyclically sadden and inspire readers, there are plenty of options for fans looking for a completed story.









 








 10  Villainess Turns the Hourglass (2020) 
Based on the Novel by Sansobi, Written by Ttaelkkam &amp; Illustrated by Ant Studio


 







Aria Roscent is a hated villainess, known for bullying her seemingly saint-like, much-beloved stepsister, Mielle Roscente. However, right as Aria is about to pay the price for the suffering she caused, she learns that Mielle had been manipulating her the entire time, in an attempt to improve her own reputation. As she finds herself sent back in time, having received an enigmatic hourglass that can turn back time, Aria is determined to get ahead of her sister and overturn her plans, obtaining everything Mielle wanted in the process.
As a brilliant revenge manhwa, Villainess Turns the Hourglass follows a villainess that, rather than refusing to play her role or switching her character to gain others&#39; affection, commits to being the best anti-hero possible. Refreshingly, Aria is willing to do anything to obtain her rightful vengeance, no matter what method she has to resort to. However, she also has plenty of redeeming qualities, making her a complex and captivating character whose story readers are sure to want to read to the end.

Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Sakk

 8  Beware the Villainess! (2020) 
Based on the Web Novel by Ppongttamatseukeuryuba, Written by Yeolmae, &amp; Illustrated by Blue Canna


 







When a modern-day Korean college student becomes the victim of a tragic car accident, she wakes up in the body of Melissa Podebrat, the villainess of a popular novel. While her status as the duke&#39;s daughter allows her to live a comfortable life, surrounded by wealth, much unlike her previous one, she is also fated to suffer in love, at the hands of the loathsome male leads who take advantage of her kind nature. However, as she lacks the patience to tolerate their antics, Melissa resolves to live her life to the fullest, even if that involves taking them out of the picture.
As far as the manhwa medium is concerned, isekai stories, particularly those revolving around villainesses, are surprisingly common. Yet even in such a crowded landscape, Beware the Villainess! stands out thanks to its unique protagonist, who follows her goals with no regard for her reputation or any social expectations. More often than not, this tends to lead to absurd and amusing situations, making this one of the best comedy manhwa.

 7  The Boxer (2019) 
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Ji-Hun Jeong
        

As a victim of continuous cruel bullying, Yu&#39;s experiences made him apathetic, to the point where he simply tolerates the idea of being beaten by others, despite having the ability to easily dodge their attacks. Everything changes when K, an experienced boxing trainer who trained several world champions, takes note of Yu and senses his unrealized potential. The moment Yu accepts K&#39;s offer marks the beginning of his journey in the complicated world of professional boxing, as well as the start of his evolution as a person.
The Boxer is a deeply reflective and inspiring title that effortlessly blends dynamic action scenes with emotional ones. Though it may seem like a typical sports story of an underdog aiming for the top at first glance, it eventually reveals itself to be much more than what is presented on a surface level. Beyond its apparent story lies a profound character-driven drama, which explores themes of meaning, humanity, and overcoming hardships.
Ji-Hun Jeong, the author of The Boxer, also created The Horizon, another highly regarded title.

 6  Who Made Me a Princess (2017) 
Based on the Web Novel by Plutus &amp; Illustrated by Spoon


 







Although being reborn as a princess may sound like a dream come true, a modern-day Korean woman knows that fate is anything but kind to her when she wakes up as Athanasia de Alger Obelia, a character in a novel. Rather than living a carefree and enviable life, she is destined to be executed by her own father, a cruel emperor, on her 18th birthday. After her first plan, of completely avoiding her father and preparing for her escape, fails, she turns to her last resort, that of warming up to the cold emperor and gaining his favor.
Proving that original stories can be told even in a theme as saturated as isekai manhwa, Who Made Me a Princess follows a familial relationship first and foremost, emphasizing emotionally impactful developments. While a romance subplot is present as well, that is far from this title&#39;s focus, with the main characters&#39; heartwarming father-daughter relationship taking that place instead. Its beautiful and vibrant art style is also exceptional, which only further elevates the experience.
