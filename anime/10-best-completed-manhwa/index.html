<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>For fans who are tired of cliffhangers and unexpected hiatuses, completed manhwa provide uncompromising experiences and satisfying conclusions.</p>
<p>As enjoyable as it may be to follow ongoing manhwa, keeping up with new chapters and wondering what could happen next, it also comes with certain risks, such as the possibility of a title being canceled too soon or of the story taking an unpleasant turn that ruins the experience. As such, many fans may instead prefer to read the best completed manhwa first, before seeking out new and uncertain adventures.
In a medium as broad and varied as the manhwa one, there is a title for everyone, whether one prefers familiar tropes polished to perfection or one-of-a-kind tales that follow unique journeys set in fantastical worlds. From lighthearted titles that provide relaxing or comedic experiences to emotionally impactful ones that will cyclically sadden and inspire readers, there are plenty of options for fans looking for a completed story.</p>
<p>10  Villainess Turns the Hourglass (2020)
Based on the Novel by Sansobi, Written by Ttaelkkam &amp; Illustrated by Ant Studio</p>
<p>Aria Roscent is a hated villainess, known for bullying her seemingly saint-like, much-beloved stepsister, Mielle Roscente. However, right as Aria is about to pay the price for the suffering she caused, she learns that Mielle had been manipulating her the entire time, in an attempt to improve her own reputation. As she finds herself sent back in time, having received an enigmatic hourglass that can turn back time, Aria is determined to get ahead of her sister and overturn her plans, obtaining everything Mielle wanted in the process.
As a brilliant revenge manhwa, Villainess Turns the Hourglass follows a villainess that, rather than refusing to play her role or switching her character to gain others&rsquo; affection, commits to being the best anti-hero possible. Refreshingly, Aria is willing to do anything to obtain her rightful vengeance, no matter what method she has to resort to. However, she also has plenty of redeeming qualities, making her a complex and captivating character whose story readers are sure to want to read to the end.

<p>9  Hellper (2011)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Sakk</p>
<p>Gwang-nam Jang&rsquo;s gang, Killberos, is unlike any other. Rather than involving themselves in destructive or even criminal acts, as other gangs would, they spend their time creating clothes and helping anyone in need, protecting their city. As such, everyone is devastated when Gwang-nam dies in an unfortunate accident. But when he wakes up in the underworld wearing a black bracelet, he learns that there is a way for him to reincarnate and return to his loved ones, although the process is far from easy.
Hellper tells a truly original story set in an intricate world, which is sure to captivate readers immediately. The art style is likewise unique, with every stroke of color being meaningful and purposeful, and the interesting characters only further add to the title&rsquo;s recognizability and memorability. Thanks to its many strengths and the remarkable way it harmonizes action scenes with emotional ones, Hellper is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy manhwa.

<p>8  Beware the Villainess! (2020)
Based on the Web Novel by Ppongttamatseukeuryuba, Written by Yeolmae, &amp; Illustrated by Blue Canna</p>
<p>When a modern-day Korean college student becomes the victim of a tragic car accident, she wakes up in the body of Melissa Podebrat, the villainess of a popular novel. While her status as the duke&rsquo;s daughter allows her to live a comfortable life, surrounded by wealth, much unlike her previous one, she is also fated to suffer in love, at the hands of the loathsome male leads who take advantage of her kind nature. However, as she lacks the patience to tolerate their antics, Melissa resolves to live her life to the fullest, even if that involves taking them out of the picture.
As far as the manhwa medium is concerned, isekai stories, particularly those revolving around villainesses, are surprisingly common. Yet even in such a crowded landscape, Beware the Villainess! stands out thanks to its unique protagonist, who follows her goals with no regard for her reputation or any social expectations. More often than not, this tends to lead to absurd and amusing situations, making this one of the best comedy manhwa.

<p>7  The Boxer (2019)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Ji-Hun Jeong</p>
<p>As a victim of continuous cruel bullying, Yu&rsquo;s experiences made him apathetic, to the point where he simply tolerates the idea of being beaten by others, despite having the ability to easily dodge their attacks. Everything changes when K, an experienced boxing trainer who trained several world champions, takes note of Yu and senses his unrealized potential. The moment Yu accepts K&rsquo;s offer marks the beginning of his journey in the complicated world of professional boxing, as well as the start of his evolution as a person.
The Boxer is a deeply reflective and inspiring title that effortlessly blends dynamic action scenes with emotional ones. Though it may seem like a typical sports story of an underdog aiming for the top at first glance, it eventually reveals itself to be much more than what is presented on a surface level. Beyond its apparent story lies a profound character-driven drama, which explores themes of meaning, humanity, and overcoming hardships.
Ji-Hun Jeong, the author of The Boxer, also created The Horizon, another highly regarded title.</p>

<p>6  Who Made Me a Princess (2017)
Based on the Web Novel by Plutus &amp; Illustrated by Spoon</p>
<p>Although being reborn as a princess may sound like a dream come true, a modern-day Korean woman knows that fate is anything but kind to her when she wakes up as Athanasia de Alger Obelia, a character in a novel. Rather than living a carefree and enviable life, she is destined to be executed by her own father, a cruel emperor, on her 18th birthday. After her first plan, of completely avoiding her father and preparing for her escape, fails, she turns to her last resort, that of warming up to the cold emperor and gaining his favor.
Proving that original stories can be told even in a theme as saturated as isekai manhwa, Who Made Me a Princess follows a familial relationship first and foremost, emphasizing emotionally impactful developments. While a romance subplot is present as well, that is far from this title&rsquo;s focus, with the main characters&rsquo; heartwarming father-daughter relationship taking that place instead. Its beautiful and vibrant art style is also exceptional, which only further elevates the experience.

<p>4  Bastard (2014)
Original Series Written by Carnby Kim &amp; Illustrated by Yeong-Chan Hwang</p>
<p>Jin Seon lives a troubled life, ruthlessly bullied at school by those who deem him too weak to stand up for himself. However, what he fears much more than the bullies is his own father, whose reputation as a respectable businessman and altruistic person is nothing but a disguise, meant to conceal his true nature. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Dong-Soo Seon is a sociopathic serial killer, who forces his son to participate in his horrific acts. But when he finally turns his attention to Kyun Yoon, a new transfer student, Jin may just find the courage to fight back.
As one of the best horror manhwa, Bastard is a one-of-a-kind psychological thriller that will certainly keep readers on the edge of their seats. Horrifying yet captivating at the same time, the story follows some of the medium&rsquo;s most loathsome and realistic characters to provide a riveting experience full of unpredictable developments. Naturally, the art style suits the experience as well, contributing to the dark and depressing atmosphere.
Carnby Kim, the one behind Bastard&rsquo;s story, also authored several other similarly enjoyable horror titles, including Sweet Home, Pigpen, and Shotgun Boy.</p>

Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Hyeon-A Cho</p>

But right before the situation gets any worse, she suddenly finds a letter taped under her desk, which marks the beginning of a fun and enlightening scavenger hunt.
Your Letter tells a compelling tale of positivity, friendship, and finding beauty in the little things in life. Though it doesn&rsquo;t hide the fact that people aren&rsquo;t always benevolent and friendly, it also reminds readers that kindness begets kindness. Fitting for the heartwarming atmosphere, the art style is also colorful and warm, which perfectly complements the theme. Due to its short length, this story can also be experienced within but a couple of hours, making it a truly unmissable short manhwa.

Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Gyeong-Chal Han</p>

<p>1  Solo Leveling (2018)
Based on the Web Novel by Chu-Gong, Written by Hyeon-Gun, &amp; Illustrated by Seong-Rak Jang</p>
<p>When the Gate suddenly appeared, connecting the human world with that of magic, the threat of monsters terrified the world. However, to combat these beasts, people received special powers, marking the birth of the Hunters. Yet not all Hunters are equal, as abilities and skills vary drastically. Initially known as one of the weakest Hunters, Jin-U Seong receives a mysterious quest after nearly facing certain death, thus becoming the Player of the System and gaining the ability to evolve beyond any known limits.
While stories about worlds changed by invading monsters and heroes who gradually grow from pathetically weak to impossibly strong are not uncommon when it comes to manhwa, Solo Leveling is one of the best examples of a power fantasy, proving that such tropes only find success because they are genuinely entertaining. Having rightfully earned its popularity as a brilliant action-adventure title, Solo Leveling is undoubtedly one of the best completed manhwa, which no fan of the medium should overlook.
Much to the delight of fans, a highly successful anime adaptation of Solo Leveling is currently being released.</p>
