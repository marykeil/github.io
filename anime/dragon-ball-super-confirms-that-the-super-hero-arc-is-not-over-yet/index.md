# Dragon Ball Super Confirms That The Super Hero Arc Is Not Over Yet


## SUMMARY 



  The Super Hero arc of Dragon Ball Super manga is not over yet, as revealed in chapter #100.   Fans hoping for the start of a new arc in chapter #100 will be disappointed, as the focus will probably go back to Goten and Trunks.   The added scene in chapter #100 sets up Carmine&#39;s revenge plot, indicating more original content to come.

## Literature Review

Chapter #100 of Dragon Ball Super surprisingly shows that the Super Hero arc is not over yet, despite fan criticism for this adaptation of the movie.




Warning: SPOILERS for Dragon Ball Super chapter #100




Chapter #100 of the Dragon Ball Super manga was supposed to mark the ending of the controversial adaptation of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, but much to fans&#39; surprise, it seems that this saga, the Super Hero Arc, is not over yet.

At the end of chapter #100 of Dragon Ball Super there is a short sentence that is used to hype up the next chapter (these are usually present at the end of each chapter in the Japanese version but are cut from the English ones), translated and shared on X by @Herms98. It says that &#34;Earth&#39;s danger is past. But the super heroes/super hero (Japanese has ambiguous plurals) battle is not over!&#34;


 

This means that, most likely, fans will have to wait a little bit more before seeing the curtain fall on the Super Hero arc of the manga, which will probably add more original content focusing once again on Goten and Trunks&#39; adventures.

This comes as a surprise for fans who were surely hoping to see not just the conclusion of the battle between Gohan Beast and Cell Max in chapter #100, but also the start of a much-anticipated new arc, perhaps with the return of Black Frieza. Instead, the manga has mostly stuck to the script of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, adding only a scene showing Carmine, the aide of defeated Red Ribbon leader Magenta, heading back to Red Pharmaceutical, plotting revenge against the heroes.

The most likely development is that, in the next chapter, Dragon Ball Super will shift its focus again to Goten and Trunks, the two young Saiyans who were the protagonists of the short &#34;prequel&#34; arc that was published before the adaptation of the movie began. Goten and Trunks had a bigger role in the Super Hero manga adaptation than they had in the movie. In chapter #100, they even help Gohan deliver the final blow to Cell Max, a scene that was not present in the movie, so it makes sense for the story to come back to them for a while.




          

While the added focus on Goten and Trunks - who were relegated to the role of comic reliefs in the movie - was surely welcomed by fans, the disappointment must still be great for those who were hoping to see the start of a new arc in chapter #100. The long adaptation of the Super Hero movie has been divisive, and the majority of fans cannot wait to see original content again in the manga. The announcement that the Super Hero Arc is not over yet is not what most readers hoped to see in chapter #100 of Dragon Ball Super, but hopefully the manga still has some good surprises in store for its next chapter.
