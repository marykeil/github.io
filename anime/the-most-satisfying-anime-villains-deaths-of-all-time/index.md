## Literature Review

Many anime feature terrifying villains who demonstrate frightening strength, abilities, &amp; cunning – and there&#39;s nothing better than their downfall.




The most satisfying anime villain deaths often involve taking revenge on an antagonist who&#39;s initially introduced as being far too fearsome for the protagonist to face head on, but with so many stories of broken childhoods and crime-solving journeys, the deaths that are the most satisfying stand out in the way they serve as a quenching of thirst when dealing out the most fitting punishments.
To no surprise, the majority of villain deaths will take place in a genre where there are plenty of heinous figures to be found: shonen. Protagonists will either struggle towards exacting revenge or play the role of a moral judge, punishing wrongdoers for their crimes. This is a frequent trope found within shonen anime, but it is effective. At the moment of climax, a villain&#39;s death will mark a resolution of some kind, prompting sighs of satisfactory relief.

 9  Nnoitra Pays the Price For His Overconfidence 
Bleach, Episode #202
        

The hit shonen action series Bleach is not only an anime about Shinigami (Soul Reapers) and Hollows; it&#39;s filled to the brim with satisfying moments and villains that get their just desserts. One such villain is Nnoitra Gilga, the fifth-ranked Espada in Aizen Sousuke&#39;s arrancar army. Having previously been ranked number eight, Nnoitra&#39;s rise in rank, accompanied by his natural narcissism, provided him with unfounded confidence in his strength.
As a result, Nnoitra stands out for his obnoxious villainy, and creates waves of satisfaction when he is eventually defeated and killed by Kenpachi, the legendary captain of the 11th division of Soul Society’s Gotei 13.

 8  Neferpitou Brings Out a Monstrous Side of Gon 
Hunter x Hunter (2011), Episode #131


 







Hunter x Hunter, which was originally adapted to animation in 1999 and then received a remake in 2011, is a shonen anime that doesn&#39;t shy away from revenge stories. While one of the series&#39; main characters, Kurapika, is a prime example of the classic revenge story and the follies that accompany it, Gon, the protagonist, is cast as an upbeat, innocent child who can have almost nothing to do with revenge until the death of his mentor, Kite.
As a result, Gon throws himself further into the war against the Chimera Ants, and when he finds Neferpitou, Kite&#39;s murderer, Gon&#39;s anger sprouts into a monstrous transformation when he brutally kills her. This is a long-awaited breaking point for the cheerful Gon, as his incredible transformation into a long-haired adult version of himself created a shocking revenge scene.

 7  The Deep Sea King Is Humbled By One Fist 
One-Punch Man, Season 1 Episode #9
        

The anime One Punch Man is, on a surface level, a classic story of heroes and villains – so naturally, some insufferable characters will make their way out of the woodwork. One such villain is the Deep Sea King, a character who is inconsequential when compared to the strength of the protagonist, Saitama, but draws the ire of both heroes and audiences alike.
This monarch of the sea who has encroached on the idea of land domination has an ego as inflated as they come, and it reaches a climax when the Deep Sea King toys with the much-weaker Mumen Rider. In addition, he easily beats Saitama&#39;s disciple and S-class hero Genos to the brink of death. Fortunately, Saitama appears and defeats the Deep Sea King with his satisfying signature punch, wiping away the insults that the Deep Sea King spewed against the hard-working heroes of the world.

One-Punch Man is full of hilariously overblown characters and heroes with monstrous strength, but is its greatest creation the humble Mumen Rider?

 6  Elder Toguro Finally Gets His Due 
Yu Yu Hakusho, Episode #84


 







First making an appearance in Yu Yu Hakusho&#39;s Dark Tournament arc, Elder Toguro is a decrepit-looking antagonist who shamelessly clings to the coattails of his younger brother of the same name. Although the Younger Toguro and his team are defeated by the protagonists, Urameshi Yuusuke and friends, Elder Toguro finds a way to survive the ordeal and slips into the shadows.
However, Elder Toguro makes a reappearance in a later arc, clinging to yet another main antagonist, Sensui Shinobu. Fortunately, the rose-wielding demon of Team Urameshi, Kurama, deals Elder Toguro his final defeat, sealing his mind in an eternal landscape of horrors with the Sinning Tree. This pseudo-death is even more terrifying than the traditional counterpart, and it provides a satisfying end to a character that has long acted as a thorn in the main characters&#39; sides.

Attack on Titan, Season 2 Episode #12
        

Attack on Titan took the anime community by storm in 2013 with its first season, and hasn&#39;t slowed down since.

After two whole seasons of trials and tribulations, Eren finally avenges his mother&#39;s death using a power that he even found unfamiliar. After a big build up, Eren commands a group of smaller titans to devour the smiling titan, providing a seemingly well-deserved and pitiful death.

 4  Light Yagami&#39;s Self-Righteousness Leads To His Demise 
Death Note, Episode #37


 







Death Note follows the story of the eponymous notebook featured prominently throughout the series, in which anybody whose name is written will die, five minutes after being recorded in its pages. The anime focuses on Light Yagami, who discovers this book, which was conveniently placed by Ryuk, a bored Shinigami, and L, the genius detective who begins looking into the mysterious deaths caused by the book.
Although Light begins as a self-proclaimed hero, removing criminals from the world, his moral standing quickly takes a turn as the Death Note is abused for his increasingly manipulative plots. By the end of the series, when Light is exposed as Kira, his true colors come to light, and he deteriorates into a desperate whiner who is disposed of by Ryuk. With Light&#39;s death, the series ends, playing a note of relief after the constant high-tension situations throughout the Death Note anime.

 3  Envy Faces the Wrath of Roy Mustang 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Episode #53
        

The story of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a tantalizing tale full of philosophical reckonings and heart-wrenching goodbyes. The story is excellent at crafting relatable, well-liked characters, but takes them away once their popularity has reached a peak. One such character is Maes Hughes, a state military officer and family man, who is toyed with and murdered by Envy the Homunculus. 
Although it was narratively fitting for Hughes to meet his end due to the embodiment of jealousy, nothing can dampen the pain of losing such a beloved character. Fortunately, with much satisfaction, Hughes&#39; best friend, the Flame Alchemist, Roy Mustang, is able to dish out a fiery plate of revenge to the lurking personification of envy who had seemed to have always gotten away before.

However, it is all worth it as Trunks is able to travel back to his own timeline with renewed strength and information to exact revenge on the androids who terrorized his world, namely Android 17 and Android 18. He easily overpowers the brother-sister duo who have long deviated towards evil, and kills them each with one blast.

 1  Danzo Was the Perfect Underhanded Villain 
Naruto: Shippuden, Episode #211
        

The Naruto franchise is one of the main pillars of shonen anime, with Naruto: Shippuden being its most popular iteration. As any good shonen series does, Naruto: Shippuden introduces some of the strongest and most heinous villains. Shimura Danzo is one of the worst villains of the entire Naruto saga. Appointed as interim Sixth Hokage after Pain decimated the Hidden Leaf Village, Danzo does everything to undermine the morals and agendas of the series&#39; main characters.
Furthermore, it is revealed that Danzo orchestrated the Uchiha Clan massacre, eventually leading to Sasuke&#39;s tragic development. When delving deeper, so many more conflicts are then linked and indirectly attributed to Danzo&#39;s antiquated and misaligned actions. When Danzo finally meets his end at Sasuke&#39;s hand, the satisfaction is subtle, but immeasurable, like a tumor finally removed from the Hidden Leaf Village.
