The legendary animated production company known as Studio Ghibli and the decades-spanning manga and anime series that is Dragon Ball are two staples of the industry with signature art styles instantly recognizable to fans around the globe. And in a new piece of fanart, Goku, Krillin, and Master Roshi get a Studio Ghibli makeover that deserves to be seen in its own movie!

 Dragon Ball Gets A Studio Ghibli Redesign In Stunning Fanart 
          

Founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki, Studio Ghibli quickly became known for its layered and emotional storytelling along with its consistently breathtaking and impeccably animated visuals, and helped to push the anime industry forward, kick-starting a legacy that continues to this day. Premiering a year before the official debut of Studio Ghibli, the original Dragon Ball manga, created by Akira Toriyama, saw similar success following the epic exploits of its main protagonist, Goku, and became a juggernaut franchise after its anime adaptation raised the bar for the medium just how Ghibli did for films.

Merging a very Miyazaki-like visual esthetic with three of Toriyama’s most famous characters, @salvamakoto imbues a young Goku and Krillin with the wide-eyed wonder of Ghibli protagonists like Spirited Away’s Chihiro Ogino or Kiki from Kiki’s Delivery Service while expertly nailing the adventurous spirit of Dragon Ball. Also illustrating Master Roshi looking out to the horizon alongside his disciples, the rolling green hills and cloud-specked blue sky complete a piece of art that fits right at home in both universes, proving @salvamakoto’s artistic skills are some of the best in the community.






 Goku, Krillin, and Master Roshi Embark On A Studio Ghibli Journey In New Fanart 
          

Studio Ghibli’s most recent film, The Boy and the Heron, shows that the studio still has it in them to create a beautifully animated and compellingly told story, something that translates well into the world of Dragon Ball, especially for Goku’s more whimsical early adventures before things became boiled down to punching and kicking everything on sight. It’s highly doubtful Studio Ghibli will ever take on animating a Dragon Ball project, but thanks to @salvamakoto, fans can at least see what the company’s unique art style would look like when applied to Goku and pals!
