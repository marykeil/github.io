## Literature Review

As with any year, there were plenty of anime in 2023 that were severely underrated, and these are the 10 that embody that more than any others.




2023 is coming to a close, and it was an all-around great year for anime. Old favorites like Attack on Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen returned to much fanfare, and new anime like Oshi no Ko, Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, and The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady all became some of the biggest hits of their respective seasons.
Plenty of anime in 2023 gained a lot of attention from fans and critics alike, but at the same time, many great anime ended up being severely underrated. Sometimes it would be a case of some occasionally bad visuals and animation distracting from a great story, and other times, it would be the overall bad timing of when certain shows premiered throughout the year, especially when it put them against major hits of each season.
        

Whatever the case, there were a lot of great anime in 2023 that did&#39;’t receive the attention they deserved, and the best of those more than warrant having attention be called to them.









 








 10  Tomo-chan Is a Girl! Waited Far Too Long To Be Animated 
Created by Lay-duce


 







While the manga was incredibly popular during its run, Tomo-chan Is a Girl! didn&#39;t receive an anime adaptation until four years after it ended. By the time the anime finally went into production, the romance and comedy tropes that Tomo-chan largely played straight had started to be seen as clichéd and boring, so despite the series having an excellently written couple, the anime was viewed as being too old-fashioned compared to others and fell to the wayside as a result.

 9  Helck&#39;s Art &amp; Animation Couldn’t Support Its Great Story 
Satelight&#39;s Helck
        

Another great anime that ended up severely underrated in 2023 is Satelight&#39;s Helck. Helck did a great job balancing absurdist parody comedy with a surprisingly dark and mature take on Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style fantasy, but in addition to having to compete with massive hits like Jujutsu Kaisen and Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, Helck, unfortunately, suffered from subpar art and animation that never allowed for the fighting and overall writing to be conveyed to their fullest. As a result, the series has received little attention from fans and critics alike, and that&#39;s unlikely to change as it heads towards its big finale.

 8  Ragna Crimson&#39;s Incredible Action Deserves Far Better 
Created by Silver Link
        

Another 2023 anime that was held back by lackluster visuals is Silver Link&#39;s Ragna Crimson. The manga is famous for its incredible artwork and fight choreography by Daiki Kobayashi, but unfortunately, Silver Link&#39;s work on Ragna Crimson, while decent, doesn&#39;t capture the artistry of the source material, leading it to come off as just another average fantasy anime. With the anime continuing into 2024, there’s a chance that production will improve, but there&#39;s no way of knowing if that will happen, especially since Silver Link is already set to produce four new anime in 2024, in addition to Ragna Crimson.

 7  Undead Girl Murder Farce Couldn’t Compete With Some Of 2023’s Biggest Anime 
Created by Lapin Track
        

Many anime fall to the wayside because they get overshadowed by their competition, and a noteworthy example of that in 2023 is Lapin Track&#39;s Undead Girl Murder Farce. The anime had a unique premise of a shared universe of public domain characters, and with clever writing and overall direction, it was one of the best mystery anime to come out in years. Unfortunately, Undead Girl Murder Farce came out in the same season as massive hits like Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 and Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, so it was ultimately overshadowed by anime with much bigger fanbases and received little attention as a result.

 6  Dark Gathering Failed To Sell General Audiences On Its Horror Story 
Created by OLM, Inc.


 







Another 2023 anime that was majorly overshadowed by its competition was OLM, Inc.&#39;s Dark Gathering. Dark Gathering has a unique take on horror fantasy that’s complemented by great writing and character designs, but with other recent, more popular shows also having horror elements, Dark Gathering ultimately ended up being overshadowed by them. Add in how Dark Gathering&#39;s art and animation don&#39;t always do a great job of showcasing these darker elements, and it makes sense that it would receive so little attention throughout its run.

 5  Girlfriend, Girlfriend Waited Too Long To Come Back 
Created by SynergySP
        

It&#39;s common for sequel seasons of anime to see a dip in popularity, and a perfect example of that is SynergySP&#39;s Girlfriend, Girlfriend season 2. While Girlfriend, Girlfriend season 1 was popular for its subversion of the harem genre, it took two years for season 2 to come out, and by that time, the anime had lost nearly all of its momentum. Not helping matters is how Girlfriend, Girlfriend season 2 aired in the same season as The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You, which does everything Girlfriend, Girlfriend does with arguably better production value and humor, so it makes sense that it would fall to the wayside.

 4  Bofuri&#39;s Production Issues Killed The Hype For Season 2 
Created by Silver Link
        

Another sequel anime in 2023 that took far too long to release was Silver Link&#39;s Bofuri: I Don&#39;t Want to Get Hurt, so I&#39;ll Max Out My Defense. season 2. While Bofuri season 1 was a breakout hit in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and other production issues caused Bofuri season 2&#39;s release to be delayed for three years, and by the time it premiered, all the momentum from season 1 had been lost. Coupled with odd pacing and even more production issues that led to certain episodes being delayed, and Bofuri season 2 completely failed to reach the acclaim of season 1.

 3  Tokyo Revengers&#39; Change In Streaming Platform Killed Seasons 2 &amp; 3 
Created by Liden Films
        

An anime’s streaming platform can have a big effect on its popularity, and an anime that was deeply hurt by that was Liden Films’ Tokyo Revengers. Season 1 was one of the biggest anime of 2021, but Crunchyroll lost the distribution rights for Tokyo Revengers to Hulu, and with Hulu&#39;s limited availability around the world, seasons 2 and 3 have received far less attention. Tokyo Revengers is still a massive franchise, and the manga was the ninth best-selling manga of 2023, but its airing exclusively on Hulu means that it won’t get the attention it deserves as it finishes its story.

 2  The Rising Of The Shield Hero Can&#39;t Shake Off Season 2&#39;s Damage 
Kinema Citrus
        

Crunchyroll never lost the distribution rights to Kinema Citrus&#39; The Rising of the Shield Hero, but season 3 has still been severely underrated, regardless. While season 3 has had some of the best writing and animation in the anime to date, the infamously poor quality of The Rising of the Shield Hero season 2 killed all goodwill for the anime, and that&#39;s caused interest in the anime to fall to an all-time low. It&#39;s far too common for one bad installment in a franchise to kill any future investment on the audience&#39;s part, and The Rising of the Shield Hero is definitely feeling that, despite its high quality.

 1  SHY Is a Fresh Take On The Superhero Genre That Very Few People Have Watched 
Created by 8bit


 







SHY has a unique take on superhero stories that takes clear inspiration from magical girl stories and features some very inventive editing and overall direction, but inconsistent art and animation, along with premiering alongside major hits like Shangri-La Frontier and Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End, has caused SHY to go largely unnoticed by fans and critics alike. Add in how over saturated the superhero genre has become in recent years, especially for Western audiences, and it makes sense that SHY would end up as one of the most underrated anime of 2023.
