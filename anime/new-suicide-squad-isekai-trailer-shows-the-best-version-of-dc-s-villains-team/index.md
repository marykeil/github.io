 The Suicide Squad Will Wreak Havoc In An Isekai World 
DC&#39;s most popular villains challenge a Fantasy-tinged world

 

The gorgeous teaser shows all the major characters from the comics that will appear in the anime: Joker, Harley Quinn, Peacemaker, Deadshot, King Shark, Clay Face, and of course their cruel overseer Amanda Waller. Although the plot is unknown, the trailer shows Harley Quinn asking The Joker if he wants to go to another world, hinting at the fact that she might be the catalyst of the adventure. However, at the end of the trailer, Deadshot says that their heads will be blown off by Amanda Walker in 60 hours, hinting that they have been sent on a mission in that world.




Like the supervillains they are, the group is seen fighting the inhabitants of the world as soon as they arrive, and from the setting it looks like this is a classic Fantasy-tinged isekai world. The trailer is nothing short of breathtaking, and looking at the staff and cast, it makes sense. This anime is a collaboration between Warner Bros. and Wit Studio, the studio behind hit anime such as Attack On Titan, Vinland Saga, and Spy X Family. The writing staff are very experienced in the isekai genre, such as director Eri Osada, who worked on The World&#39;s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat, and Jujutsu Kaisen, and co-writer Tappei Nagatsuki, who is the creator of Re: Zero. The opening song will be performed by Tomoyasu Hotei, a legend in the music industry with a career spanning 40 years, and it will be titled &#34;Another World&#34;.

          




The release window has been confirmed to be in 2024, joining the likes of Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War part 3 and Oshi No Ko season 2. This collaboration between a Japanese studio and a foreign company isn&#39;t the first though, as Adult Swim and Mappa are making a sci-fi anime, and Netflix and Science SARU put out Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Everyone wants a piece of the anime pie, which is great news for fans as more anime can only be good. Suicide Squad ISEKAI is a daring and ambitious project that sees one of the most popular groups in comics coming to anime, bringing both fans of the medium together.

               Suicide Squad ISEKAI   Genres:   Action, Adventure, Anime    Rating:   Not Yet Rated    Seasons:   1    Writers:   Tappei Nagatsuki, Eiji Umehara    Franchise(s):   DC Universe    Directors:   Eri Osada
