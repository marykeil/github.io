## Literature Review

Many battles in Naruto Shippuden are filled with poetic drama, while others are just flat-out epic and cool, but only ten can be ranked as the best.




Unlike Part 1 of the series, Naruto Shippuden is filled with land-ravishing battles, some poetic in their presentation, and others still shared and talked about more than a decade after they aired. Many of the best fights in Naruto Part 1 featured effective strategies with clever uses of ninjutsu with limited power and abilities. However, after the 3-year time skip, Naruto and the scale of the franchise&#39;s battles significantly bulked up.
Naruto Shippuden starts three years after Naruto and Sasuke&#39;s first big clash at The Valley of the End. In that time, both the main characters and the Akatsuki group grew considerably in strength. With the organization of powerful rouge ninjas on the hunt for Tailed Beast charka, Naruto Shippuden hosts extreme battles with the seemingly unstoppable organization and a lot more.
        

Ninjas capable of immortality, creating airborne microscopic explosives, and resurrecting the dead populate some of Naruto Shippuden&#39;s best fights. The series gives most of the beloved cast time to shine with arcs filled with tales of revenge, sorrow, and war. While the series has dozens of battles worth watching, not every fight hits the beautiful peaks of tear-inducing drama and satisfying action that the Naruto series is capable of.









 








 10  Shikamaru Vs Hidan - The Fall Of Akatsuki&#39;s Immortals 
Chapters #332 - 341 | Episodes #83 - 88


After the murder of Shikamaru&#39;s sensei, Sarutobi Asuma, he had to prove himself in a quest for revenge against two Akatsuki members who had each attained a form of immortality, the Immortal Butcher Hidan and the heart-stealing Kakuzu.
&#34;Your god is not that stupid Jashin or anything. Now...I will hand down judgment.&#34; - Shikamaru Episode #88 

With the help of Kakashi, a brilliant strategy was devised and implemented that both avenged Asuma and delivered some of fiction&#39;s coldest final words to the immortal severed head of Hidan. Shikamaru&#39;s wit and Kakashi&#39;s combat skills were pushed to their limits against Akatsuki&#39;s Hidan and Kakuzu, two ruthless foes that only Konoha&#39;s future Hokage could best.





 9  Sakura &amp; Chiyo vs Sasori - Sakura Sets Shippuden&#39;s First High Bar For Battles 
Episodes #20 - 27 | Chapters #264 - 275


The incredible team-up between the Sand Villages Elder Chiyo and the Leaf&#39;s Hanaro Sakura was not just the latter&#39;s best fight but also one of the most entertaining in the series. One of Shippuden&#39;s first big epic battles featured Sasori&#39;s mysterious and overwhelming arsenal of deadly once-human puppets. However, it was a prime example of how the franchise and its characters matured since Part 1&#39;s conclusion. Outstanding direction and fluid animation gave Sakura&#39;s shining moment the attention it deserved when her overwhelming strength and Chiyo&#39;s experience combined to triumph over Sasori&#39;s 100 poison-filled puppets.





 8  Four Tails Naruto Vs Orochimaru - Revenge For Years Of Filler Arcs 
Episode #40 - 43 | Chapters #291 - 296
        

Naruto&#39;s rage and the power of the Nine Tail&#39;s chakra finally met an opponent that deserved every ounce of their fury: Orochimaru. Anime fans endured years of filler episodes after Sasuke was lured into Orochimaru&#39;s clutches with the promise of gaining strength. Watching Naruto lose control and unleash unseen levels of devastation with his rampaging Nine Tails chakra was exciting. However, the battle was made even more satisfying for fans who felt that Orochimaru&#39;s manipulation of Sasuke resulted in years of anime filler episodes. Plus, the Sannin, previously Part 1&#39;s most intimidating shinobi, going all out meant that Shippden&#39;s threats would only grow in scale from there.

 7  Jiraiya Vs Pain - Akatsuki&#39;s Leader Taught The Fanbase Pain 
Episodes #130 - 133 | Chapters #374 - 383
        

Many Naruto fans had their days ruined by the emotional death of Jiraiya The Gallant at the hands of his former student Pain. While Naruto&#39;s teacher did figure out the secret to the leader of Akatsuki&#39;s abilities, it was too late to win the monstrous battle. By summoning powerful Toad Allies and his rendition of Sage Mode, Jiraiya defeated Pain&#39;s own summons and his wide variety of attacks with style. Still, the Sannin ultimately fell after letting his guard down and facing the full extent of the Six Paths of Pain while grievously injured, but not without a genuinely epic final stand and a tear-jerking internal monologue.





 6  Reanimated Madara Vs Shinobi Alliance - Uchiha Madara Makes His Entrance 
Episodes #322 | Chapter #560


Madara&#39;s name had mostly been spoken as a legend until Akatuski&#39;s Tobi began going as the moniker. However, the world shook when the real Madara was brought back as an immortal zombie with infinite chakra. The shaking was caused by the fear of those in the Shinobi Ninja Alliance who had to charge against the intimidating foe or the two meteors he dropped onto them later in the battle. Episode #322 of Naruto Shippuden heavily expands on the manga&#39;s battle. The fear and bravery of warriors rushing into a losing situation are dramatically adapted and help cement just how overpowered the infamous Naruto villain really is. Madara against an army stands as one of the medium&#39;s best villain entrances.

 5  Sasuke Vs Itachi - Bloodthirsty Revenge Against A Big Brother&#39;s Love 
Episodes #135 - 138 | Chapters #383 - 394


For years, Sasuke and fans of the series anticipated the fateful battle against the seemingly evil older brother Uchiha Itachi. The long-desired battle followed one of the franchise&#39;s most heartbreaking deaths, and author Masashi Kishimoto knew precisely how to make fans feel better: by delivering one of the series&#39; most anticipated and epic battles yet. After learning about the context behind Itachi&#39;s actions, the battle between the Uchiha brothers becomes a different kind of emotional apart from Sasuke&#39;s rage and determination. While Itachi spends the last of his life ridding his brother of Orochimaru&#39;s influence, Sasuke demonstrates to his brother and audiences how far he&#39;s come in a world that would later need his strength.

 4  Naruto vs Pain - A Brutal Clash Between Two Warriors Of Peace 
Episodes # 163 - 169 | Chapters # 429 - 443
        

From Sage Naruto&#39;s grand entrance to the catastrophic emergence of several of the Nine-Tails beast forms, the Pain fight felt like it could have been the series&#39; final battle. Jiraiya&#39;s death set the stage for the colossal clash of ideals between his students, who both desired peace in the war-torn shinobi world. Few battles in the series manage to create the sense of dread that the Pain arc did by having the Akatsuki leader kill several beloved characters and then decimate Konoha. Although moments of the fight&#39;s animation didn&#39;t jive with all audiences, the intense battle between Naruto and Pain is one of anime&#39;s greatest.





 3  Guy vs Madara - Hard Work And Sacrifice Nearly Killed An Evil God 
Episodes # 419 - 421 | Chapters # 668 - 672


The Eight Gates technique was a stellar plot device established years before its ultimate payoff that nearly killed Madara, history&#39;s strongest shinobi, after he&#39;d achieved a god-like state. First introduced in Rock Lee&#39;s high-ranking battle against Gaara, the eight gates technique unlocks physical limiters on one&#39;s body to access intense wells of hidden strength. However, the more limiters that are broken, the more harm the user&#39;s body endures until its final gate sacrifices the user&#39;s life for a monstrous power boost. After Madara killed Naruto and Sasuke, Guy Sensei finally opened the final gate to end the war, which helped create many fans&#39; favorite moment in the Naruto storyline.
Guy&#39;s big moment against the Six Path&#39;s version of Madara was an epic sacrifice to ensure that the next generation was allowed to bloom. While the technique ultimately failed to put Madara down for good, the full power of Guy&#39;s Eight Gates left a significant impression on viewers and Madara himself, who couldn&#39;t help but compliment the taijutsu user&#39;s ferocious attacks. With punches strong enough to create air cannons, kicks that ignited the air, and an ultimate attack that was powerful enough to bend space-time itself, Eight Gates Guy versus Madara is a moment built up for years and remains in fans&#39; memories forever.

 2  Kakashi Vs Obito - Easily One Of The Anime Mediums Best Directed Fights 
Episodes # 375 | Chapters # 636


While the Naruto manga was released week to week, the reveal that Kakashi&#39;s former teammate was the masked man blew readers&#39; minds around the world. However, the anime&#39;s adaptation of the reveal and Obitio&#39;s ultimate battle against Kakashi in the time-space dimension surpassed the manga in many ways. Incredible animation and storyboarding flowed with an emotional score as Naruto&#39;s teacher confronted his past and the instigator of the Fourth Great Shinobi War.
Naruto&#39;s father, the Fourth Hokage, taught Kakashi and Obito when they started as ninjas, and a sparring session between the two is beautifully intercut between moments of their older self&#39;s deadly duel. Satisfying taijutsu, creative ninjutsu counters, and cunning tricks make the dramatic battle between Minato&#39;s pupils the definition of what a Naruto ninja battle should be.





 1  Naruto Vs Sasuke - A Perfect Final Battle For Kishimoto&#39;s Epic Ninja Tale 
Episodes # 476 - 477 | Chapters #694 - 698


The franchise includes genius foes who planned generations in advance, characters capable of obliterating mountains in seconds, and even an all-powerful alien. Still, the true plot of Naruto revolves heavily around humanity&#39;s cycle of hatred caused by violence and revenge, represented in Sasuke, against the idea of understanding each other with empathy and working together, as represented by Naruto. And despite the controversial introduction of Kaguya during the epic war arc, Naruto Shippuden delivered one of the most satisfying conclusions any series has seen with its final battle between Naruto and Sasuke.
Masashi Kishimoto&#39;s ninja epic took 15 years to tell, and during that time, Naruto and Sasuke gained a range of incredible abilities. Their final battle sees the pair meet again at The Valley of the End and demonstrate each of the powerful skills they acquired over the years. In a showcase of brilliant pacing, the young ninjas start with excellently choreographed taijutsu before taking on their huge planet-shaking forms that would permanently damage their world&#39;s surface. While large-scale attacks reach a new definition during the best Naruto Shippuden fight, the emotional final moments in the battle between the exhausted brothers in arms help solidify the series&#39; inspirational message that helped provide one of fiction&#39;s most satisfying conclusions put to paper.
