<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Tower of God is one of the most highly regarded manhwa stories, and rightfully so. Fans looking for a similar experience need to check these titles.</p>
<p>Tower of God is a highly appreciated and influential manhwa title, as evidenced by its popularity, high ratings, and successful anime adaptation. Naturally, all of its acclaim is entirely deserved, given its incredibly intricate story, intriguing characters, and engaging action scenes. As such, it is only to be expected that fans would be interested in other titles that emulate the experience in some way.
While no other manhwa title out there may copy Tower of God in its entirety, there are plenty of options that come close in some way or another. From those that follow a similar protagonist, progressing from weak and unnoticeable to extremely powerful, to those that otherwise replicate its setting, story, or overall atmosphere, fans should be happy to know that there are quite a few stories that should evoke a similar feeling of enjoyment for them.</p>
<p>10  Tomb Raider King (2019)
Based on the Web Novel by Sanjijiksong, Written by Yoonz, &amp; Illustrated by 3B2S</p>
<p>When mysterious tombs suddenly appear around the world, people inevitably get drawn to these dangerous dungeons and the powerful magical relics they can obtain by passing all their trials. Joo-Heon Seo is one such explorer, who nearly dies in a tomb after being betrayed by his boss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself sent 15 years into the past by a strange relic, at the time when tombs begin showing up. Determined to obtain revenge and avoid his past mistakes, Joo-Heon Seo sets out to become the titular &ldquo;Tomb Raider King&rdquo;.
In terms of similarities to Tower of God, Tomb Raider King also features similar dungeon-like areas with imaginative challenges, as well as creative powers and characters. The quality of its overall story may be somewhat debatable, with certain twists possibly seeming contrived, but the art, characters, and action are otherwise enjoyable and comparable to the aforementioned title.

<p>9  I&rsquo;m the Max-Level Newbie (2021)
Based on the Web Novel by Meseullou, Written by WAN.Z, &amp; Illustrated by Seuwingbaet</p>
<p>Kang Jin-Hyeok is a streamer and content creator known for being the only person who managed to clear the game Tower of Trials. Just as the game is declining in popularity and Kang prepares to change his focus, the Tower of Trials suddenly shows up in reality, along with a message according to which humanity will perish unless the tower is cleared. Armed with vast experience and knowledge of the game, Kang sets out to save the world and live out his fantasy life.
Both Tower of God and I&rsquo;m the Max-Level Newbie follow protagonists ascending a tower, starting out as weak and progressing quickly along the way, eventually reaching the top of the rankings. The latter also features fantastic artwork and compelling fights, though its story and characters are certainly not as original or complex as the former&rsquo;s.

<p>8  SSS-Class Revival Hunter (2020)
Based on the Novel by No-Ah Shin, Written by Neida, &amp; Illustrated by Bill K</p>
<p>After the Tower mysteriously showed up one day, people were immediately drawn to it, and those who had nothing to lose, or were otherwise willing to abandon everything, became hunters, facing its numerous trials and fighting the different floors&rsquo; various monsters in search of fame and wealth. Confucius Kim is one such hunter, whose unrestrained envy of stronger hunters compels the Tower to grant him a unique skill, that lets him copy abilities at the cost of his own life. Upon gaining the ability to travel back in time, his new journey to the top begins.
The similarities between Tower of God and this title are self-evident, as SSS-Class Revival Hunter features the familiar premise of ascending a dangerous tower, with the protagonist also growing in strength progressively. Additionally, the title&rsquo;s art is phenomenal, the story is surprisingly complex, and the characters are likewise well-developed, making it one of the most underrated manhwa out there.

<p>7  A Returner&rsquo;s Magic Should Be Special (2018)
Based on the Web Novel by Usonan &amp; Illustrated by Wookjakga</p>
<p>When the dangerous and mysterious Shadow Worlds start threatening the safety of the world, it is up to the mages to protect humanity. After a devastating war culminates in a fight between the few remaining mages and their impossibly powerful foes, the world seems to be doomed. However, just as the end is about to come, Desir Arman finds himself sent back to the past, in his early days as a student at the Hebrion Academy. Determined to prevent the future he experienced, Desir sets out to strengthen himself and his allies and save everyone from a tragic ending.
As a brilliant reincarnation manhwa, A Returner&rsquo;s Magic Should Be Special may seem quite different from Tower of God at a glance, but the protagonists are strikingly similar. While Desir travels back in time and Baam does not, both of them grow stronger throughout the story, and also create bonds with their allies, protecting each other and improving together. Moreover, they both use their intelligence to navigate new situations and act strategically.
A Returner&rsquo;s Magic Should Be Special received an entertaining anime adaptation in the Fall 2023 season, whose second season has been officially announced.</p>

<p>6  Hardcore Leveling Warrior (2016)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Se-Hun Kim</p>
<p>Won-Ho Gong is a passionate gamer who earned the highest rank in Lucid Adventure, a VR sandbox game that can be played in one&rsquo;s dreams, by maximizing all of his stats and using a skill known as &ldquo;The Bet&rdquo; to gamble with opponents and take their unique items and skills. But just as he was about to reach new heights, he was struck down by Zero, one of the game&rsquo;s gods, and lost everything, having to start all over again. Despite this setback, Won-Ho is determined to regain his rank and achieve his goals.
Much like Tower of God, Hardcore Leveling Warrior also follows a protagonist who is progressively getting stronger throughout the story, as well as a variety of well-developed side characters. Moreover, while the story itself is not nearly as intricate or compelling as the former&rsquo;s, it is still more than enjoyable. As for the art style, it may seem somewhat inconsistent, but the author&rsquo;s improvement over time is undoubtedly visible.</p>
<p>10 Best Manhwa on Webtoon
Webtoon has a little of something for everyone with well over a million titles to choose from. Here are 10 of the best manhwa on the platform.</p>
<p>Read on Webtoon</p>
<p>5  Second Life Ranker (2019)
Based on the Web Novel by Do-Yeon Sa, Written by Na-Ra, &amp; Illustrated by Nong Nong</p>
<p>The Obelisk is a mysterious tower, said to have been created by the Sun God, with 100 floors, all of which have different environments, managers, and objectives to achieve. These objectives come in various forms, from passing certain trials to defeating powerful beasts, but the reward is worth the effort, as the &ldquo;Player&rdquo; who climbs to the top is supposed to become a god. After his younger twin brother is betrayed while climbing the tower, Yeon-Woo Cha decides to follow in his steps and avenge his brother.
There are plenty of explicit similarities between these titles, as both Tower of God and Second Life Ranker revolve around the zero-to-hero journey of characters who are ascending a mysterious tower with varied floors and challenges to overcome. While the latter title may not be as popular as the former, its story, art, and characters are all remarkable nonetheless.
The creator of the Second Life Ranker web novel also authored The Divine Twilight&rsquo;s Return, a similarly enjoyable title that received a manhwa adaptation.</p>

<p>4  Player (2020)
Original Series Written by Jong-Seok Park &amp; Illustrated by Hyeon-Jun Oh</p>
<p>After leaving a particular comment on a webtoon, Seol-Jin Heo is selected by the god of the webtoon&rsquo;s world to become a titular &ldquo;Player&rdquo;. Now stuck in a completely new world, he has no choice but to climb a tower in search of power and wealth, competing with other players along the way. Although he starts out as the weakest one, Seol-Jin receives a legendary sword and special powers thanks to his unique origins, which he uses to evolve progressively, beyond known limits.
Evidently, Tower of God and Player share a lot of features in common, from the tower setting to the weak protagonist with unlimited potential. However, there are also differences between them, as the latter is a terrific isekai manhwa. As for Player&rsquo;s story and characters, while they are surprisingly well-done, they don&rsquo;t exactly come close to the heights of Tower of God.</p>
<p>3  Solo Leveling (2018)
Based on the Web Novel by Chu-Gong, Written by Hyeon-Gun, &amp; Illustrated by Seong-Rak Jang</p>
<p>The world is redefined by a new threat, in the form of mysterious gates leading to magical dungeons. These gates are ranked by their threat level, with E-Rank ones hardly posing a noteworthy risk, while S-Rank ones are dangerous enough to be considered an emergency for entire countries. Thankfully, along with the appearance of these gates, people were granted special powers, thus becoming &ldquo;Hunters&rdquo;. Yet not everyone is equally powerful, with Jin-Woo Sung, for instance, being the weakest of all. That is, at least, until the &ldquo;System&rdquo; gives him the chance to evolve without limits.
While Tower of God&rsquo;s setting is decidedly different, Baam is similar to Solo Leveling&rsquo;s Jin-Woo, in that they are both initially considered weak, only to eventually become some of the most powerful and feared characters in their respective stories. Solo Leveling&rsquo;s story may be a bit more divisive, as some find it too generic, but they are both great fantasy manhwa titles nonetheless.
Solo Leveling is officially set to receive an anime adaption, releasing in January 2024.</p>

<p>2  Level Up with the Gods (2021)
Based on the Web Novel by Black Ajin, Written &amp; Illustrated by O-Hyeon</p>
<p>Despite being one of the strongest warriors around, Yu-Won Kim ends up losing the war with the Outer Gods. Refusing to accept this fate, he returns in time with the help of Chronos, seeking to avoid his past mistakes and change the outcome of the war. Now back at the starting line and armed with more knowledge than before, Yu-Won seeks more efficient ways to strengthen himself and his allies, learning skills and ascending the Tower by clearing its various floors administrated by different gods.
While its setting and protagonist may make it seem like an uninspired copy of Tower of God, Level Up with the Gods distinguishes itself through its creative characters and fun, action-packed story. Despite its common setting, the title explores the tower&rsquo;s history in-depth, making it that much more immersive, and the artwork is likewise exceptional.</p>
<p>10 Best Manhwa Which Deserve Anime Adaptations
Lots of manhwas have the potential to be great anime adaptations, but these titles prove their worth with their captivating storylines and artwork.</p>
<p>The creator of the Level Up with the Gods web novel also authored The Hero Returns, a similar title which was also adapted into a manhwa that fans should enjoy.</p>
<p>Read on Tapas</p>
<p>1  Kubera (2010)
Original Series Written &amp; Illustrated by Currygom</p>
<p>In a world defined by an everlasting war between immortal gods and suras, ordinary, powerless humans are helplessly caught in the crossfire. The titular Kubera is one such human, whose entire village is destroyed by a sura on her 16th birthday. Even after losing everything, however, she is not fully alone, as a powerful and famous magician known as Asha comes to her aid. Together, they embark on a fateful journey, seeking not only revenge but also answers.
The similarities between Tower of God and Kubera are not surface level, but fans of one title are likely to enjoy the other one as well. While the former&rsquo;s action-oriented scenes are generally superior to the latter&rsquo;s, Kubera also emphasizes the importance of an intricate, expansive world, and a wide cast of complex characters whose motivations and stories are explored in-depth, to an even greater degree. Therefore, despite its different premise and setting, it is still regarded as one of thebest manhwa for fans of Tower of God.
