## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #19 will finish the first stage of the First Class Mage Exam and show off more of its participants.




After episode #18 introduced a brand new arc, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End is sure to continue exploring its various newly introduced characters in episode #19. While Frieren has always excelled at its episodic storytelling, this arc seems interesting enough to serve as a pleasant change of pace. Hopefully, its second episode will continue that trend and provide a fun conclusion to the first stage of the First Class Mage Exam.

It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on January 19 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 1 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 18:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #18? 
          

Episode #18 finally featured Frieren, Fern, and Stark arriving at the magical city of Außerst. Frieren and Fern both signed up for the First Class Mage certification exam, which is supposed to be challenging even for a mage of Frieren&#39;s caliber. The episode also introduced various other exam entrants such as the murderous mage Übel and the rival mages Lawine and Kanne. The first part of the test paired Fern up with Übel and Frieren with Lawine and Kanne, taking them to capture an elusive type of bird. While struggling to find and cage one for the majority of a day, the episode ended with Frieren seemingly figuring out a way to apprehend one.






Lawine and Kanne seem to not know about Frieren&#39;s fascinating immortality yet.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #19 Will Finish the Exam&#39;s First Stage 
          

With the first of the 2 days allotted to the first stage used up and Frieren having a plan to capture the bird they need, episode #19 will almost certainly bring the first stage to a close. Along the way though, the other test takers may attack them in order to disqualify them from the round. This is especially likely for Fern&#39;s partner Übel, who seems to be itching to use any excuse she can get to kill mages. This could lead to some exciting fights that show off the various abilities of mages who haven’t gotten much screen time yet and could help establish some tension going into the second stage of the exam.




With episode #18 being more of a setup episode for the general First Class Mage Exam arc, episode #19 will hopefully delve more into the characters themselves and help viewers care about these new faces. The end of the first stage of the exam may also bring some surprising results depending on how many teams are able to pass. Depending on what unfolds, this could become the best arc of Frieren&#39;s already superb fantasy story. This exciting arc is only just getting started so fans of Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End should look forward to when episode #19 releases on Crunchyroll on January 19.

Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #19 when it airs on Crunchyroll on January 19, 2024.
