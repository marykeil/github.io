Six years after the ending of season 2, classic isekai Konosuba finally announces the release of its long-awaited season 3.





The announcement came at Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko 35th Anniversary Festival.Konusuba shared a promotional video that revealed a new cast and a release of season 3 in 2024, although no exact date was provided. The first two seasons were animated by Studio Deen, and for the third Studio Drive will take over, as they were responsible for the spin-off that aired in 2023. Studio Drive has worked on hit anime such as Demon Slayer and My Dress-Up Darling. Yujiro Abe will direct the new season and Koichi Kikuta will be the character designer. Most voice actors will be returning and there will be three new faces: Kanon Takao, Yahagi Sayuri and Reina Ueda.

 The Long-Awaited Third Season Of Konosuba Is Almost Here 

 

The Konusuba anime is based on the light novels of the same novel by Kurone Mishima and Natsume Akatsuki, which serialized from 2013 to 2020 with 17 volumes. The light novel was very popular, receiving an anime adaptation for season 1 back in 2016. With movies, spin-offs and games, Konosuba is not only one of the most popular isekai out there but also one of the most popular anime. Season 3 will pick up right where the last season left. Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness will continue their journey to defeating the Demon King. After defeating the Demon King&#39;s general and gaining a reputation, although it was all accidental, the group is now closer than ever in their quest.

Konosuba is a hilarious action and isekai series. Although the setting and themes may be not very different from the well-established tropes of the isekai genre, the dynamics of the group is what really sells the show, as all of them are pretty useless and at each other&#39;s throats for that. Thanks to the masochistic Darkness, the stubborn Megumin, the ultra-useless Aqua and the perverted Kaguya, Konosuba&#39;s mark in the isekai genre world will be felt for a long time.



 2024 Will Be An Amazing Year For Anime 
          

The anime market saw an explosive growth in 2022 and 2023, but it looks like 2024 will also be a year to look forward to. Kimi Ni Todoke, Solo Levelling, Classroom of the Elite 3, Blue Exorcist and many more explosive new or returning series will make sure that fans won&#39;t be starving for quality content. Konosuba will definitely be an anime to watch out for in a year filled with highly anticipated series, as it offers comic relief, lovable characters and much more, all wrapped in a classic isekai package.




Seasons 1 and 2 of Konosuba are available to stream on Crunchyroll.
