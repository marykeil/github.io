## Literature Review

Baby is perhaps the creepiest villain in Dragon Ball GT, not only that, but he has proven to be the exact opposite of Majin Buu because of one power. 





Majin Buu is an ancient cosmic being who was first controlled by the villainous sorcerer Bibidi long before the events of Dragon Ball. Back then, Majin Buu was pure evil with the strength to consume gods (like the Lord of Lords) and decimate planets like it was nothing. Eventually, the combined might of a number of divine entities proved enough to force Buu into a potentially eternal sleep–that is, until he was awakened by the sorcerer Babidi during Dragon Ball Z’s aptly named Majin Buu Saga. During that saga, Buu exhibited abilities that had never been seen before, including targeted blasts that could kill everything on Earth in a single shot, the power to transform someone into food (primarily chocolate), and the ability to absorb anyone and take on some of their physical traits while wielding the full-extent of their power. In short, Majin Buu was practically unstoppable, which is actually something he shares with the villain-in-question from Dragon Ball GT–though one of their abilities are the exact opposite of each other.




                  Dragon Ball Confirms the One Z-Fighter Buu Can’t Beat (&amp; it’s Not Goku)   Even though Goku beat Buu, DBZ made it clear that he couldn&#39;t do it alone, but one Z-Fighter hints that they could defeat Majin Buu single-handedly.    


 Majin Buu Absorbs His Victims Into Himself, While Baby Does the Opposite 
          

In Dragon Ball GT season1, episode 24 (written by Atsushi Maekawa, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), Goku, Trunks, and Pan are taking a much-needed break on a planet following their encounter with the creepiest villain they’ve ever come across: Baby. Baby is a powerful Dragon Ball GT Machine Mutant who recently completed a re-birth process and is currently at large. Like Buu, Baby has an incredibly high power level and is able to essentially become sentient goo, making him practically untouchable. In this episode, Baby is stalking the Z-Fighters on this world in a way that makes it nearly impossible for them to track him: Baby is possessing people.




With every person Baby possesses, he steals their life force and retains a bit of their power. This process is how Baby grows in strength, with the added benefit of hiding in plain sight while hunting his enemies. While it is similar to what Buu does, it is actually the exact opposite. When Majin Buu absorbs people, he turns into loose goo and covers their entire body–then he takes on some aspects of their aesthetic while adding their power to his own. Baby’s process is essentially the reverse of Majin Buu’s as he turns into goo and slides inside his victims where he drains them completely after puppeteering their bodies for a bit, then Baby disposes of their drained corpses.

Both villains are goo-based, both are perhaps the most repulsive villains in their respective Dragon Ball eras, and both absorb the power and life force of their victims. While they do basically the same thing, they each do it in a way that is the total reversal of the other–proving that Dragon Ball GT’s creepiest villain is the exact opposite of Majin Buu.
