## Literature Review

The Heike Story anime series is the perfect place to start for anime fans interested in learning more about the history of Feudal Japan.




The anime series The Heike Story is the perfect place to start for anime fans interested in learning more about the history of Feudal Japan. In the original Japanese, the anime and the poem it adapts are known as Heike Monogatari, based on an alternate reading of the kanji for the name of the Taira clan, whose rise and fall the story chronicles.




As narrated in the 14th-century epic poem known as The Tale of the Heike, the Genpei War (1180-1185) is one of the most famous and important conflicts in Japanese history. In Japan, the influence of The Tale of Heike is comparable to the Iliad in Europe, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms in China. The opening lines of the poem, translated here by Australian scholar Arthur Lindsay Sadler, are among the most famous in all of Japanese literature:


The sound of the bell of Gionshoja echoes the impermanence of all things. The hue of the flowers of the teak tree declares that they who flourish must be brought low. Yea, the proud ones are but for a moment, like an evening dream in springtime. The mighty are destroyed at the last, they are but as the dust before the wind.


In one aspect the original poem is an introspective and philosophical text and all of the events narrated are seen through the lens of Medieval Japanese Buddhism. Looked at in another way, it&#39;s an epic war story full of larger-than-life heroes, featuring some of the famous celebrated samurai warriors and most famous battles in Japanese history.





 The Heike Story is a Must-Watch For History Buffs 
          

The anime&#39;s primary point of view character is a musician named Biwa, a character created specifically for the anime rather than being based on any of the original poem&#39;s characters. The main character being a musician is thematically fitting since the original Tale of the Heike was meant to be recited aloud with musical accompaniment. Biwa is primarily a passive observer of the series&#39; events, giving the audience a surrogate who understands exactly as little about the intricacies of the Imperial Japanese court as they do. It&#39;s a clever storytelling device that allows exposition to be delivered for the benefit of the audience potentially unfamiliar with Japanese history and folklore without coming across as clumsy.

A full written version of The Tale of the Heike is hundreds of pages and thousands of lines long. The Heike Story anime, meanwhile, is only 11 episodes long, meaning the story and details are abridged. For example, the original text of The Tale of the Heike devotes paragraphs at a time to intricately describing the armor and weapons of the story&#39;s battling samurai. It&#39;s much easier to depict that quickly in a visual medium like animation, which means the series&#39; runtime can be better devoted to the events and character interactions. Even so, certain sacrifices must be made to fit such a sprawling story into 11 episodes.

The Heike Story does at least cover the most important plot beats of the original poem. The initial rise to power of the Taira is explained to the audience, along with their descent into tyranny and the reasons for the outbreak of the Genpei War. The climactic naval battle of Dan-no-ura which ended the war gets an entire episode to itself. Admittedly, most of the things that are being skipped over won&#39;t be of any real interest to a general audience. It&#39;s a necessary sacrifice to make to condense years of history into 11 episodes, but it&#39;s a fantastic overview of the period.

In abridging the source material and emphasizing the most famous episodes in The Tale of the Heike, the anime adaptation of the poem in The Heike Story makes very wise storytelling choices to bring one of the most important literary works in Japanese history to a wider audience. The Heike Story is a fantastic introduction to the period and is a must-watch for anime fans who want to learn more about Feudal Japan.
