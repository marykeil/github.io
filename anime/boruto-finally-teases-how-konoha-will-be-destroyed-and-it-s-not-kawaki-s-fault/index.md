## Literature Review

While the destruction of Konoha seemed an inescapable result of the battle between Boruto and Kawaki, its fall will be due to a more sinister reason.





In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #2, Boruto has returned to Konoha Village after three years to defend it against an attack by Code and his army of beast soldiers known as Claw Grime. Code created them in Boruto Chapter #72, by using his Claw Mark technique to cut off pieces of the Ten-Tailed Beast that Isshiki Otsutsuki had long ago stashed away in another dimension. Once cut off from the Ten Tail, the pieces transformed into smaller humanoids. Code also upgraded their abilities by giving them a tweaked version of his Claw Mark ability that allows them to teleport through each other. However, it appears that Boruto knows something about the Ten Tails that even Code ignores. When he orders Code to retreat with his Claw Grimes, he adds &#34;do it now as long you&#39;re still able to control them&#34;.





 By Unleashing The Claw Grime, Code Is Playing With Fire 
          

As recounted in Naruto, during the Fourth Shinobi War, even shinobi as skilled and experienced as Madara and Obito Uchiha had difficulty controlling Ten Tails. Code clearly believes letting the Claw Grimes loose on Konoha gives him a tactical advantage. He also gloats to Boruto that he has several thousands of these soldiers ready, but apparently Boruto&#39;s most lackluster villain made yet another mistake. As Boruto alluded to in the chapter, making use of the Ten-Tailed Beast is an extremely risky endeavor. The creature is driven by a desire to devour an Otsutsuki, and the Claw Grimes will bite everyone in the vicinity until they find out. However, Boruto says that while this may normally be the case, Code&#39;s Ten Tails spawns are different due to the fact that he enhanced them.




Boruto&#39;s understanding of the Ten-Tails surely comes from something that happened during the three years time skip, perhaps from researches and discoveries he has made with his mentor and now fellow rogue shinobi, Sasuke. In fact, Boruto even says to Code that he doesn&#39;t understand &#34;the true horror of Ten Tails&#34;, meaning he knows something that the villains ignores. However, Boruto&#39;s most interesting (and ominous) quote in the chapter comes when he orders Code to get rid of the Claw Grimes, &#34;or else, we&#39;ll end up in the worst possible future for everyone&#34;. It&#39;s hard to not read this as a reference to the apocalyptic vision of a destroyed Konoha seen in the famous flash-forward that opened Boruto.



 Konoha&#39;s Destruction Is Inevitable 
          

Fans mostly believed that the destruction of Konoha would be a result of the feud between Boruto and Kawaki, and the latter&#39;s betrayal at the end of Boruto part 1 seemed to confirm the hypothesis. However, it now seems that it will be Code&#39;s messing with Ten Tails to bring forth that ominous future. Clearly, Boruto&#39;s main goal in going to Konoha is not simply to save his village and friends, but rather to force Code to bring him to the location where Ten Tails is hidden. This makes it more than likely that the destruction of Konoha seen in the Boruto opening flash forward will be largely due to Code&#39;s Claw Grimes (or possibly Ten Tails itself) rather than to the fight between Kawaki and Boruto.
