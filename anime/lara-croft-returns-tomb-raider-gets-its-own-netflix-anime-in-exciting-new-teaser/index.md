## Literature Review

A new teaser for the upcoming Tomb Raider anime has dropped and given fans a title and a clear line of what&#39;s next for Lara Croft.





As part of Netflix&#39;s huge Drop 01 event, the official teaser for the upcoming Lara Croft anime dropped on the streamer&#39;s official anime YouTube channel to give fans a peek at what&#39;s to come. Arrows are shown flying across the screen as Lara uncovers supernatural forces. It&#39;s everything fans of the popular video game franchise could want. It all culminates in the reveal of the series&#39; official title, Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. Take a look at the teaser here!





 What The Legend of Lara Croft&#39;s Title Means for the Franchise 

 

With the title officially unveiled for the upcoming anime, it seems clear where the franchise is going. The three reboot games from Square Enix put Lara through a lot as she slowly developed into the hero fans knew from the original games. However, it left the narrative on an open note when Lara returned to Croft Manor to establish it as a base to protect the world&#39;s mysteries. This anime will pick up where that story left off by showing Lara on her first adventure as the character fans knew from her early days while finding ways to establish how she acquired the look fans came to love in the original games. This could include when she acquires her dual-wielding pistols and makes them her signature weapon for the first time, signifying her passing of the torch from the reboot to the classic games.

 Loose Ends from the Reboot Could Finally Be Tied 
          

One of the most notable moments from the official teaser is a brief moment where Lara looks at a photograph of her friends from the first of the Tomb Raider reboot games. While Jonah would continue to appear in both Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Sam and Reyes disappeared and were never seen again after their adventure with Lara on Yamatai. This anime continuation could finally tie up what happened to them and close the book on their story by having Lara reconnect with them. If they don&#39;t make an appearance, Lara could finally explain what happened to them and why they&#39;re no longer a part of her adventures. It&#39;s a mystery that continues to be speculated by fans to this day, so to potentially have an answer in The Legend of Lara Croft could finally give a sense of closure for this take on the character.




As of right now, there is no current release date announced for The Legend of Lara Croft. The teaser simply ends with a &#34;Coming Soon&#34; before closing out. However, given the quality of the animation on display, it&#39;s safe to assume that it will arrive sometime in early to mid-2024. The return of Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider universe has been long-awaited by fans since its announcement, and based on this teaser, it looks like it will be one of Lara&#39;s best adventures yet.
