## Literature Review

Gojo and Sukuna&#39;s epic battle has at long last come to an end albeit in the most unexpected way that has fans everywhere heartbroken and in denial.





Although it seemed like the battle was all but decided in Chapter #235, the latest chapter has subverted expectations and concluded the fight in the most unexpected way. Spoilers for Chapter #236 reveal that Gojo has been utterly defeated by Sukuna and Mahoraga and has reunited with several beloved, deceased characters from the series in the afterlife. Fans are already showing their love for the moment on Twitter as fan Omar best exemplifies with their Tweet &#34;Incredible ending for Satoru Gojo, the best sorcerer of all and one of the best manga characters of recent years jujutsu kaisen is a masterpiece.&#34;





 Jujutsu Kaisen Kills Off Gojo in a Heartbreaking Twist 

 

Chapter #236 is ready to break hearts with a touching reunion between Gojo and Geto. Spoilers reveal a tear-jerking panel of Gojo imagining Geto among the other sorcerers cheering him on before the fight as he states he might&#39;ve been more satisfied if Geto were there too, at which the latter simply laughs and sheds a discreet tear. The chapter will also see Gojo reuniting with several others dear to him including Nanami, Principal Yaga, Lev Haibara, and even Riko Amanai.

Sad as the outcome may be, Gojo has gone down with dignity after giving the fight his all and has no regrets as he supposedly tells Principal Yaga according to fan translations. If anything, Gojo reveals that he only feels sorry that he could not make Sukuna give the battle his all. Regardless, Chapter #236 has left fans in denial with many holding out hope that Shoko may be able to heal Gojo or that he may give up the Six Eyes to use Reversed Cursed Technique and revive himself. Sadly, given Gege Akutami&#39;s well-known dislike for Gojo, a comeback seems unlikely, especially after such closure.




Though the series may never be the same again, Gojo&#39;s defeat was necessary as the plot would not be able to progress without him. Chapter #236 has not only created an opportunity for the other sorcerers on standby to enter the fight but also set the stage for a final showdown between Sukuna and Yuji, who has been set up as the one destined to ultimately face Sukuna from the very beginning of Jujutsu Kaisen.

Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Viz Media.
