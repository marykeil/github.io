## Literature Review

Fantasy settings may be a dime a dozen, but not all mages are equal. These sorcerers and spellcasters stand at the apex of the anime magic world.




Anime mages represent one of the most common type of characters in the medium, given just how popular fantasy worlds of sword and sorcery are. Yet even among the numerous wizards and witches that lead the stories beloved by anime fans, some stand clearly above the others in terms of raw power and expertise over magic.
Magic is one of the more versatile sources of power, as it can take any form and make use of any element, whether natural or not. Some mages prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic, devoting themselves to mastering their craft, while others are more keen on learning a large variety of spells, ensuring their arsenal is equipped with a solution to every issue they could possibly encounter.









 








 10  Howl Jenkins Pendragon Can Move Buildings 
Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, Studio Ghibli, 2004
        

Studio Ghibli&#39;s Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&#39;s titular protagonist Howl Jenkins Pendragon is a highly talented and respected wizard, known under many different names. He is quite different when compared to some other entries on this list, as his power does not manifest itself in the form of highly-destructive spells, capable of turning the tides of battles in his favor. While he does participate in the ongoing war, and he is noted for being Madame Suliman&#39;s best pupil, he instead prefers using his magic to fly and transform into different beings, getting out of unpleasant situations. He also has a contract with Calcifer, the Fire Demon, which further boosts his magic capabilities.

 9  Anos Voldigoad Performs The Impossible Magic 
The Misfit of Demon King Academy, Silver Link, 2020
        

As the reincarnation of the Demon King of Tyranny, Anos Voldigoad is quickly branded as The Misfit of Demon King Academy, because he not only possesses magical power so high that it cannot be assessed by normal means, but he is also capable of spells thought to be either impossible, such as resurrection, or lost over time, such as teleportation magic. Yet, as the founding ancestor, using impossibly powerful magic from the Mythical Age is as natural as breathing for him. Even beyond his immense magical power, he is equally gifted in terms of strength, speed, and intelligence, with some considering him the most powerful character in anime.

 8  Natsu Dragneel&#39;s Fire Dragon Slayer Magic Destroys All 
Fairy Tail, A-1 Pictures, 2009
        

With the world of Fairy Tail being full of powerful mages, it is nearly impossible to determine who is superior to all others. For instance, as the Ace of the Fairy Tail Guild, some may consider Gildarts Clive to be stronger. However, as the protagonist of the story, Natsu Dragneel&#39;s journey takes him from a point where he wields nothing but his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic, which is already strong enough and further boosted by his emotions, to a stage where he can enter the Fire Dragon King Mode at will. Even that is not his most powerful form, as he later obtains godlike demonic abilities through his E.N.D. Power.

 7  Julius Novachrono Stops Enemies in Their Tracks 
Black Clover, Studio Pierrot, 2017


 







In the world of Black Clover, the title of Wizard King has nothing to do with noble birthrights; instead, it is a title that can be bestowed upon anyone within the Magic Knights organization, if they prove themselves to be powerful enough through merits and achievements. As such, it should be no surprise that, as the most recent Wizard King, Julius Novachrono, is also the most powerful mage of the series, using his time magic to easily control the flow of battles, accelerating, stopping, and even reversing time to heal wounds. In spite of his proven mastery over magic, he always continues to search for new types of magic.

 6  Ainz Ooal Gown Knows Hundreds of Spells 
Overlord, Madhouse, 2015
        

After getting stuck in the world of a DMMO-RPG planned to shut down, Overlord&#39;s protagonist resolves to live as his character, Ainz Ooal Gown, and use his knowledge and experience with the game to conquer it. Widely regarded as the most powerful magic caster in the world, Ainz has achieved multiple feats thought to be impossible, especially when it comes to magic. For instance, while even players who reached the highest level could learn no more than 300 spells, he managed to use his special ability to learn no less than 718 different spells. Not only is he able to use high-tier magic, but he can also summon powerful beings at will.

 5  Megumin&#39;s Explosion Magic is Unmatched 
KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World!, Studio Deen, 2016


 







As KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World! is not a particularly serious title, instead taking the comedy-parody route, its characters often tend to be underestimated in terms of raw strength. Moreover, with Megumin being obsessed with Explosion Magic and refusing to learn any other spell, it may seem that she is actually quite weak. However, she is still an Arch Wizard and a member of the Crimson Demons, and her potential is unrivaled, thanks to her naturally high mana reserves and magical power. Even with her downside of being overly specialized, she remains a force to be reckoned with, especially when certain conditions are met.

The Seven Deadly Sins, A-1 Pictures, 2014
        

As a member of The Seven Deadly Sins, Merlin, the Boar&#39;s Sin of Gluttony, is known as the greatest mage in Britannia, and for good reason. Not only does she possess the unique power of Infinity, which allows her to keep her spells active endlessly, but she also makes use of a Sacred Treasure known as the Morning Star Aldan, a versatile crystal orb through which Merlin often channels her spells, and sometimes even transfers her soul into, to avoid lethal physical damage. Even without her unique abilities and weapons, Merlin has mastered a large variety of spells, which she uses to gain the upper hand effortlessly in any situation.

 1  Rimuru Tempest is Unstoppably Powerful 
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Eight Bit, 2018


 







Classifying Rimuru Tempest from That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is not exactly straightforward, as they tend to combine magic with swords when engaging in combat. Regardless, the majority of Rimuru&#39;s most powerful abilities are within the realm of magic, with their magical power further being boosted after awakening as a Demon Lord. Simply put, Rimuru&#39;s best strength is their potential to evolve, as proven by their journey from their humble origins as a Slime. After combining the Raphael and Beelzebuth skills to create Azathoth, a unique ultimate skill, Rimuru is able to not only duplicate and create virtually any ability, but also devour souls and create boundless chaos. All of this put together makes Rimuru anime&#39;s most powerful mage of all time.
