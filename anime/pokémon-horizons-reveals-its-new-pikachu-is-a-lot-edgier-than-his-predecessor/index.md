# Pokémon Horizons Reveals Its New Pikachu Is A Lot Edgier Than His Predecessor


## SUMMARY 



  Pokémon Horizons introduces a new, edgier side to the character of Captain Pikachu, who is running his own Pokémon fight club aboard the airship.   The fight between Polteageist and Shuckle shows that Pokémon genuinely enjoy testing their skills against each other.   Captain Pikachu&#39;s rough personality and appearance contrast with Ash&#39;s Pikachu, making him a unique and intriguing character in Pokémon Horizons.

## Literature Review

Captain Pikachu of Pokémon Horizons has already set himself apart from Ash&#39;s Pikachu, but the latest episode proves how different they really are.




Warning: Spoilers for Pokémon Horizons Episode #30Pokémon Horizons&#39; Captain Pikachu has already proven to be a very different character from Ash&#39;s Pikachu, but the latest episode takes that to a new level, as it&#39;s revealed that Captain Pikachu has his own Pokémon fight club. It&#39;s a very different side of Pokémon than the anime has really ever shown before, and it&#39;s as bizarre and hilarious as it sounds.




In episode #30 of Pokémon Horizons, a mysterious purple liquid appears aboard the airship, and Liko and Roy decide to investigate the source. After having no luck for most of the day, the culprit is revealed to be a Polteageist that somehow wandered aboard, and this Polteageist has a bone to pick with the crew&#39;s Shuckle.

          

Captain Pikachu sees the challenge and invites Polteageist down below decks, where a circle of Pokémon are waiting. Captain Pikachu signals to Shuckle and Polteageist that they may fight it out here, and the two immediately square off.



Pokémon Horizons&#39; English dub has not yet been released, but is supposedly due before the end of 2023.








 Captain Pikachu Runs His Own Fight Club In Pokémon Horizons 
          

Given that most of the Pokémon aboard the ship are part of this club (including Terapagos), the episode gives the impression that this is a regular occurrence aboard the airship. Polteageist and Shuckle actually begin their duel as if they&#39;re boxing, with Polteageist putting up its fists and Shuckle its tentacles. The situation escalates, however, and Shuckle ends up using a move that appears to be rollout, which hits at first, but eventually misses Polteageist and crashes into a cargo crate of berries. While they initially seem to want to continue fighting, the surrounding Pokémon cheer wildly, with Polteageist having earned their respect.

The idea of a Pokémon fight club is definitely a weird one, but it does seem to indicate just how much Pokémon love fighting. While Pokémon is sometimes criticized for having the creatures fight one another, it&#39;s clear here that they simply have a legitimate enjoyment of putting their skills to the test against one another, whether humans are involved or not. Still, running a fight club is certainly something that one would never see Ash&#39;s Pikachu doing, further separating the character of Captain Pikachu from his predecessor. Ash&#39;s Pikachu was often a peacemaker between the other Pokémon, whereas Cap here has decided that letting them fight it out is what&#39;s best for Polteageist and Shuckle.




          

Captain Pikachu definitely brings a whole new attitude to the electric mouse, with a rougher, edgier personality than that of the very family-friendly Pikachu that belonged to Ash. In the end, though, he&#39;s still a Pikachu, so there&#39;s only so much edge he can actually have. The contrast between Cap&#39;s personality and appearance is definitely a big part of the character, though, and this Pokémon fight club is just another way to exaggerate that contrast. One can&#39;t help but wonder what other kinds of bizarre shenanigans Captain Pikachu might get up to in future episodes of Pokémon Horizons.

               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.
