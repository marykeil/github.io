  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Main characters with great development can make or break an anime, as they are the ambassadors of the show and occupy most of the screen time.
The development of the main characters&rsquo; viewpoints in life enhances the viewer&rsquo;s experience and adds depth to the narrative.
Some main characters constantly evolve throughout the story, while others maintain the same ideals but become less naive and more nuanced.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From timid to tenacious, these 10 anime protagonists evolve in captivating ways, leaving a lasting impact on the world of storytelling.</p>
<p>The best anime unmistakably also always have a main character with great development. As the ambassadors of the show, the main characters can make or break an anime. Although there could be many reasons an anime fails, a bad or stagnant main character is a big reason as most of the screen time is on them.
Some of the best anime have the main characters who gradually or sometimes instantly develop their viewpoint in life. They learn more as they experience the world for what it is and adjust their ideals accordingly. Other incredible characters like Naruto and Luffy become even more steadfast in their opinions after facing adversity. Having a protagonist with great character development increases the viewer experience immensely.</p>
<p>10 Best Naruto Story Arcs, Ranked
Naruto is a manga that had plenty of separate story arcs, and these are ten of the best major story arcs in the series.</p>
<p>10  Hinata Shoyo Levels Up As A Player
Haikyuu!!</p>
<p>One thing that Haikyuu!! did brilliantly is the gradual progress of Hinata Shoyo. He wasn&rsquo;t extremely skilled at the beginning, but he did have great potential. Facing many strong opponents made him realize just how much he was outclassed, and how he would be a nobody on the court without his teammate Kageyama. Through various training sessions, matches, and experience, Hinata became the type of player he always wanted. He was finally a key part of the team, and together they reached what they didn&rsquo;t think was possible in part due to Hinata&rsquo;s explosive growth as a volleyball player.</p>
<p>10 Reasons Why Haikyu!! is the Biggest Sports Anime
For many reasons, Haikyu!! has seen phenomenal success as one of the most memorable sports anime. Audiences are sure to be drawn by what it offers.</p>
<p>​​​​​​</p>
<p>9  Midoriya Becomes A Model Hero
My Hero Academia</p>
<p>The Midoriya seen in episode #1 of My Hero Academia is completely different from the one who appears in the most recent episode of the anime. From the weak and wimpy boy who aspired to become a hero to a serious contender for All Might&rsquo;s replacement, Midoriya&rsquo;s ideals have more or less stayed the same, but he is much less naive. He has witnessed the death of many innocent civilians and friends, so tragedy has made him more aware of the reality of being a hero. His biggest change was in the Dark Hero arc where he became a lone wolf, but his great friends helped him come back from the grips of depression.</p>
<p>8  Hikigaya Hachiman Gets Out Of His Shell
My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU</p>
<p>Starting the series as an introverted and bitter high school boy, Hikigaya was forced to join the Volunteers Club by his teacher. The only thing is, the club had only one other member: the equally introverted and sharp-tongued Yukinoshita. Together, they take on requests from other students to help them out and each grows as a person. Hikigaya&rsquo;s journey from a hateful outcast to someone who cares about his friends is incredibly refreshing. He was even able to convey his true emotions later and thus bloomed the love between him and Yukino. From an unbearable narcissist to someone who is relied on, Hachiman&rsquo;s growth is truly inspirational.</p>
<p>7  Ken Kaneki Has A Tragic Ending
Tokyo Ghoul</p>
<p>Kaneki had one of the sadder stories in anime and an even sadder conclusion. A naive and trusting college student, his life changed for the worse when he became a half-ghoul after being attacked by Rize, the murderous ghoul. He was not able to eat normal food, wasn&rsquo;t able to continue school, and encountered many violent ghouls. Although he did find a sense of belonging with other ghouls and learned that ghouls were just as varying as humans, he still met a terrible end.
Tokyo Ghoul has a different ending in the anime compared to the manga.</p>
<p>6  Shinichi Conquers His Fears
Parasyte: The Maxim</p>
<p>When disaster struck on Earth and murderous aliens possessed humans, the nervous wreck known as Shinichi was lucky that he caught the alien before it fully took over his body. However, it now resided in his hand and gave him extraordinary power. Shinichi&rsquo;s character growth is one of the most remarkable in all of anime, becoming an extremely brave person and risking his life for others. Although he went through his fair share of despair and heartbreak, he eventually fell in love and he had a fairly heartwarming conclusion.</p>
<p>5  Gon Succumbs To His Rage
Hunter X Hunter</p>
<p>Although character development usually spans the whole series, Gon&rsquo;s development spiked in the Chimera Ant arc. He finally got a taste of the dark side of battles, even though he had already faced the Phantom Troupe. His anger was gradually increasing and was almost unrecognizable from the cheerful boy he used to be, especially after accepting that Kite was dead. Brutally killing Neferpitou, Gon gave in to his dark desire and was momentarily the most powerful character in the series, even if that came at a terrible cost. It was then up to his best friend Killua to rescue Gon and make him healthy again.</p>
<p>10 Most Satisfying Anime &amp; Manga Rage Moments That Get The Blood Pumping
Fights in anime involve many emotions but sometimes anger takes over. These are the best depictions of rage in anime and manga.</p>
<p>4  Eren Yeager Becomes A Mass Murderer
Attack On Titan Character development is usually attributed to a change for the better, but Eren&rsquo;s case is the exact opposite. He was always a bit twisted, but viewers could justify that with his extreme surroundings and seeing his friends die in battle. However, nobody could expect that he would become a genocidal maniac who wiped off billions of humans from the face of the Earth. His main goal was to guarantee peace for Paradis, but as his friends told him in the end, there were better ways to do this. Eren&rsquo;s big change remains today one of the most controversial decisions in manga and anime history.</p>
<p>3  Shigeo Kageyama Learns To Accept His Emotions
Mob Psycho</p>
<p>Considered one of the best anime of all time, Mob Psycho focuses on the kind-hearted esper Shigeo as he balances the life of an average student and his incredibly powerful abilities. He works as an exorcist under the money-hungry Reigen who apparently takes advantage of his powers but actually really cares for him. Meeting other people burdened by ghosts, fighting against powerful espers, and joining the Self-Improvement Club aids Shigeo in his pursuit of navigating life. Starting as an introvert who bottles up his emotions and has trouble socializing, Shigeo&rsquo;s journey is a metaphor for his blooming into an adult who learns to accept everything that comes with being human.</p>
<p>2  Shoya Ishida Atones For His Sins
A Silent Voice</p>
<p>Although he was still a child, Shoya was a terrible bully who made Shoko&rsquo;s life a living hell, no matter how kind she was to him. Tormented by his guilt of bullying a deaf girl who was nothing but sweet to him, Shoya tried his best to rectify his actions. Although it took a lot to gain her trust and most importantly, make peace with himself, Shoya succeeded in gaining forgiveness and even rescued Shoko when she tried committing suicide. His character redemption is one of the best despite having a simple premise, and he solidified himself as an inspirational character.</p>
<p>1  Thorfinn Renounces Violence
Vinland Saga</p>
<p>Thorfinn grew up on the battlefield trying to get revenge on Askellad for murdering his father. He killed hundreds and helped pillage villages. Haunted by his sins, he gave up on life and was later enslaved. Thorfinn&rsquo;s life changed drastically when he met the new slave Einar, and learned that he could atone for what he did. His redemption arc is what made Vinland Saga season 2 a contender for anime of the year. Thorfinn becomes one of the few true pacifists in anime, despite the fact that he has to survive in the ruthless world of the Vikings. Few character arcs feel so realistic and humane as what Vinland Saga does with Thorfinn.
From evil to good and vice versa, the sky is the limit to how many directions an author can take in progressing their main character. The most memorable characters are those who are constantly evolving the more they experience, while others don&rsquo;t change in terms of ideals, but they become less naive as they experience the nuances of the world. Having main characters with great development can be what differentiates an average anime from an extraordinary one.</p>
