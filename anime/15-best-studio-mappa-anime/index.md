## Literature Review

With around 50 anime series, Studio MAPPA&#39;s best anime run the absolute gamut from gory action, to unique idol series, and even to standard shonen.




Each anime studio has its own unique touch, which is why it&#39;s so surprising that Studio MAPPA&#39;s best anime are so wide and varied. Founded in 2011, MAPPA has exploded in popularity recently after the studio was given responsibility over several high-profile manga adaptations. A studio cracking just one huge adaptation would instantly make it notable, the fact that MAPPA has dozens of big hits marks it as legendary.
            
 
 MAPPA &amp; Acclaimed Writer Team Up With Netflix For New Supernatural Romance Anime 
Maboroshi is the latest directorial work by Mari Okada; between her and MAPPA&#39;s animation, Netflix seems to have another winner locked in for January.



Beyond faithful adaptations, all the anime MAPPA creates brings something original to the table. It&#39;s not enough for an anime to just straight up adapt its source, the best anime use the medium&#39;s unique strengths to enhance already stellar source material. It&#39;s this process of not just adapting source material but improving it that defines most of MAPPA&#39;s best anime.









 








 15  The God of High School (2020) 
1 Season, 13 Episodes
        

The God of High School sees protagonist Mori Jin, a South Korean martial artist, enter into a brutal fighting competition in which the victors will earn the right to have any wish granted by a mysterious corporation. However, things ramp up after the introduction of &#34;borrowed powers,&#34; which are ethereal energies used by some of the fighters to perform superhuman feats in combat. While this adaptation of a Manhwa hit has its detractors, The God of High School&#39;s action scenes make the series more than earn its ranking among MAPPA&#39;s best anime.

 14  Zombie Land Saga (2018, 2021) 
2 Seasons, 24 Episodes


 







Given that MAPPA is adapting well-known Shonen and Seinen manga, it&#39;s easy to assume that Zombie Land Saga is out of place among MAPPA&#39;s impressive catalog. However, when looking closer, MAPPA&#39;s thumbprint is all over anime&#39;s most unique idol series. The series follows a group of seven girls from throughout Japanese history brought back to life as zombies to form an idol group. With a morbid premise, a lovable cast of characters, and some surprisingly wholesome diversity of gender identities, Zombie Land Saga easily ranks among MAPPA&#39;s best anime.

 13  Rage of Bahamut (2014, 2017) 
2 Seasons, 36 Episodes
        

Based on a Japanese mobile game of the same name, Rage of Bahamut takes place two thousand years after humans, Gods, and demons joined together to seal away the titular leviathan and bring peace to the land of Mastarcia. The key sealing the monster away was split into two, but, when a mysterious amnesiac returns to the land with one-half of it, war begins to rage between those who want to revive Bahamut and those who want to keep it locked away. While it falls into many familiar genre tropes, Rage of Bahamut is a wonderfully visceral and action-packed series that evokes that Saturday-morning cartoon feeling sought after by many shonen fans.

 12  Kakegurui (2017, 2019) 
2 Seasons, 24 Episodes
        

A hyperviolent high-school anime centered on gambling, Kakegurui is a must-watch for its offbeat humor and stylized gore. The protagonist, Yumeko Jabami, is a talented gambler who changes the stakes at an elite school that&#39;s run on such gambling games. One can expect the unexpected with the way the tables turn in every episode. For instance, the players seek a thrill from betting on their own lives when the stakes are too high. All in all, Kakegurui might not be for anyone, but its overall weirdness is undeniably impressive.

 11  Terror in Resonance (2014) 
1 Season, 11 Episodes
        

With just 11 episodes, Terror In Resonance makes for a perfect binge for fans of underrated psychological anime series. The thriller starts off with a few youngsters stealing an atom bomb and threatening to destroy Tokyo until they get answers to government secrets. The attackers have had their own share of personal trauma which they wish to overcome, as they are the survivors of a covert operation to develop humans into weapons. This dark version of the present forms the setting, and the series delves heavily into concepts of authoritarianism and the trustworthiness of governing bodies. It doesn&#39;t shy away from its depiction of violence and terrorism to explore notions around what a perfect &#34;modern society&#34; would look like.

 10  Dorohedoro (2020) 
1 Season, 12 Episodes, 6 Shorts
        

Dorohedoro is a hugely underrated Netflix anime that retains the dystopian style and goofy humor of the manga that it is based on. Revolving around a reptile-headed amnesiac&#39;s quest to retain his memories, the post-apocalyptic backdrop is visually pleasing and interactive. Despite the setting, the anime largely deals with sorcery and dark arts rather than sci-fi. After being converted into his reptilian form, the protagonist, Caiman, quests to find the sorcerer behind his metamorphosis. A larger conspiracy is then unearthed involving humans being used as guinea pigs by the magical forces.

 9  Banana Fish (2018) 
1 Season, 24 Episodes
        

Banana Fish is a must-watch single-season anime that relies heavily on tropes set up by not only its titular manga but also crime thrillers from the &#39;90s. The central friendship between gang leader Ash Lynx and journalist Max Lobo offers the emotional punch while a mind-control conspiracy related to the Iraq War adds to the thrills. Even though the series was set in the 2010s—the manga on which it is based was set in the 1980s—the references and visual style still have a classic feel to them, setting Banana Fish apart from its contemporaries in the crime thriller genre.

 6  Dororo (2019) 
1 Season, 24 Episodes
        

The classic manga Dororo was famously interpreted in a 1969 anime. It was essentially a fantasy story revolving around the adventures of a young Ronin with prosthetic limbs called Hyakkimaru and an urchin called Dororo. The former&#39;s body parts are stolen by demons, prompting him to search all over for them. This central storyline is retained in the 2019 MAPPA update, although it does deviate majorly from the source material. All in all, it&#39;s an engaging dark fantasy anime with multidimensional characters. Hyakkimaru&#39;s quest isn&#39;t to just find his body, but to also find the purpose and identity of his life.

 5  Jujutsu Kaisen (2020 - 2023) 
2 Seasons, 47 Episodes


 







A shonen anime with elements of dark fantasy and adventure, Jujutsu Kaisen has garnered a huge following despite having debuted a few years ago. The plot largely follows high school student Yuji Itadori and his adventures after he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to kill a powerful Curse. Yuji also harbors a villainous monster within of which he&#39;s able to muster control. The dark elements aside, Jujutsu Kaisen avoids familiar anime tropes and offers a healthy dose of bizarre humor and allusions to iconic shōnen anime like Bleach and Naruto.

 4  Hajime no Ippo: The Rising (2000 - 2014) 
3 Seasons, 127 Episodes
        

Hajime no Ippo (also known as Fighting Spirit) is a Japanese boxing anime that Madhouse developed, but its third season, titled Rising, fell under the purview of MAPPA. It largely retained the original cast of boxers, chiefly the Featherweight Champion Makunouchi Ippo, who must defend his title in the face of new opponents. Boxing as a subgenre of sports fiction has become quite oversaturated with similar underdog themes and melodramatic bouts. However, Hajime no Ippo: Rising does show the introspective side of its boxer rather than just focusing on fast-paced action.
The first 76 episodes of Hajime No Ippo: The Fighting! are available on Crunchyroll.

 3  Vinland Saga (2019 - 2023) 
2 Seasons, 48 Episodes


 







Though Studio WIT handled season 1 of Vinland Saga, season 2 was done by none other than MAPPA. Many anime go through studio changes in their lifetime, but few are as thematically fitting as Vinland Saga&#39;s. Season 1 of the series follows a young viking boy named Thorfinn as he seeks revenge for the murder of his father while season 2 follows an older Thorfinn who has become a slave. In many ways, season 2 of Vinland Saga plays out like an entirely different series as Thorfinn spends his time focussing far more on farming than on fighting. The fact that season 2 is slower than the first without sacrificing any of the nuance or depth is a testament to MAPPA&#39;s keen eye for characterization.

 2  Chainsaw Man (2022) 
1 Season, 12 Episodes


 







One of the most outrageous anime to release from MAPPA, 2022&#39;s Chainsaw Man follows a young man named Denji who fights devils as the titular Chainsaw Man. The manga series from the enigmatic Tatsuki Fujimoto is famous for its wild plot and its introspective narrative in equal measure. Because of these dual natures, adapting the series faithfully is no small achievement, which makes it all the more thrilling that MAPPA knocked it out of the park. The acclaimed studio went all out for the anime too, producing not only an incredible opening layered with hidden meaning but also an impressive 12 closing themes. The sheer level of quality and effort put into season 1 marks Chainsaw Man as one of MAPPA&#39;s best anime.

 1  Attack On Titan: The Final Season (2013 - 2023) 
4 Seasons, 89 Episodes


 







Attack On Titan continues to be one of the biggest anime series of all time. Though Wit Studio developed the series&#39; initial seasons, MAPPA stepped in for the final one. As has been the premise of the series, the final season continues the post-apocalyptic war between humanity and Titans. However, unlike other dark fantasy and sci-fi anime, Attack on Titan benefits from an underlying philosophy behind its multi-layered characters as they discover their origins and history with every subsequent mission. It&#39;s this nuance in the overall writing that definitely sets itself apart from its contemporaries. Attack on Titan: The Final Season is the culmination of more than a decade of storytelling, and the result is MAPPA&#39;s best anime to date.
