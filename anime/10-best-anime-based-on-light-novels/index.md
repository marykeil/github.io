 10  Dirty Pair is a Pro Wrestling-inspired Pulp Space Opera 
Based on the novels by Haruka Takachiho.
        

Dirty Pair is a female-led Sci-Fi anime series following Kei and Yuri, the title pair of freelance Trouble Consultants. Although the two insist that their team is to be called the Lovely Angels, the inhabitants of the galaxy at large know them better as the Dirty Pair thanks to their tendency to cause inordinate amounts of destruction and collateral damage on their missions. Author Haruka Takachiho&#39;s original inspiration for his novel series was Japanese women&#39;s professional wrestling in the 80s, leading to Kei and Yuri&#39;s distinct visual design and team dynamic. Dirty Pair is overall a lighthearted Space Opera romp with genuinely impressive action sequences and the title pair often achieve victory through some frankly brilliant lateral thinking.

 9  Goblin Slayer is a Dark Spin on Classic RPG Archetypes 
Based on the novels by Kumo Kagyu.
Goblin Slayer contains sensitive and graphic content. 

        

Goblin Slayer recently returned for its second anime season, once again establishing itself as a grim and gritty Dark Fantasy version of the standard Fantasy anime world. Like many other Fantasy anime series, Goblin Slayer is set in a world that largely operates on RPG logic, though one tempered with much more realism than the standard Fantasy world. Goblin Slayer is unafraid of demonstrating the realistic and often bleak consequences of trying to charge straight into battle and often brutally deconstructs the standard depiction of Fantasy adventure and combat. The tonal darkness and graphic subject matter will likely turn off some viewers, but Goblin Slayer is undeniably a fascinatingly dark approach to the standard Fantasy world, coupled with excellent art animation.

 8  Toradora! Stands Out as a Slice-of-Life Story 
Based on the novels by Yuyuko Takemiya.


 







Most anime based on light novels are Sci-Fi or Fantasy-genre, so Toradora! is notable for being a Slice-of-Life romantic comedy. Toradora!&#39;s greatest strength is its fantastic cast of characters. Although these characters rely on fairly standard character archetypes for a high school-set anime, the writing is intelligent enough to play around with these archetypes in clever ways that really help to drive both the humor and the drama of the series. Admittedly, Toradora! goes through a bit of an identity crisis, with the back half of the anime focusing more on the drama than the comedy, a direction that alienated some fans. Even so, Toradora! remains an enjoyable and memorable series.

 7  Overlord Follows the Lives of Fantasy Villains 
Based on the novels by Kugane Maruyama.
        

Isekai is currently one of the most popular anime genres. Overlord&#39;s basic premise of its protagonist being transported into a video game is a common Isekai storyline, though Overlord makes itself distinct with a story that follows the villains rather than the heroes. A longtime player is transported into the world of an MMO and takes on the role of the powerful lich Ainz Ooal Gown, serving as a powerful evil boss character for the world&#39;s heroes to overcome. In his conflicts with the world&#39;s heroes, Ainz is a standard ruthless Fantasy villain. However, when interacting with his minions, Ainz is genuinely benevolent and caring. It&#39;s an interesting way to turn a typical Fantasy world on its head and offers a look into how Fantasy villains spend their time when they&#39;re not fending off questing heroes.

 6  Classroom of the Elite Is a New Approach to High School Drama 
Based on the novels by Sh≈çgo Kinugasa.
        

Classroom of the Elite is one of many anime set in a high school. The series makes itself distinct by taking the drama of going to high school to its logical extreme. While the series doesn&#39;t introduce any supernatural or even particularly unrealistic elements to its high school setting, Classroom of the Elite does take place in a very exaggerated high school setting. The school where the series takes place is Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School, a heavily stratified school divided based on academic ability, with the higher-ranked students having better prospects. The drama of the plot is driven by the protagonist Kiyotaka, a student in the lowest-ranked class, learning to navigate this setting and achieve his goals by manipulating and outmaneuvering his rivals.

 5  Spice and Wolf Breaks Down How Life in a Fantasy World Actually Works 
Based on the novels by Isuna Hasekura.
        

Spice and Wolf is a surprisingly educational anime. The series examines many aspects of everyday life in its medieval Fantasy world, with a major focus on economics. The series follows the travels of the merchant Lawrence and the wolf goddess Holo, a member of a long-forgotten pantheon of gods replaced by the rise of a new religion. Thanks to Holo being several centuries out of touch with humanity, Lawrence is given many opportunities to explain how human society has changed from the world she remembers. Despite this heavy focus on exposition, the writing and character interactions are strong enough that it&#39;s never boring and several of Lawrence&#39;s business deals end up spiraling into compellingly frantic escapes from the antagonists.

 4  Slayers is a Brilliant Blend of Fantasy Adventure and Comedy 
Based on the novels by Hajime Kanzaka.


 







Slayers is driven by a hilarious cast of characters who are brilliant parodies of classic Fantasy archetypes. Lina Inverse is a selfish and short-tempered antihero. Gourry is the wielder of the setting&#39;s most powerful magic weapon, but a complete idiot. Amelia is a naive and bombastic aspiring warrior princess. Zelgadis is the quiet, stoic straight man the other characters play off. With the assistance of a rotating cast of supporting characters, the four main protagonists find themselves the only ones capable of saving the world from certain doom. While the plot of Slayers does have legitimately high stakes, it never takes itself entirely seriously, and the main cast creates genuinely hilarious moments in how their idiosyncratic personalities interact with each other.

 3  Record of Lodoss War is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired High Fantasy Epic 
Based on the novels by Ryo Mizuno.
        

The novel series that inspired the Record Lodoss War anime was itself inspired by author Ryo Mizuno&#39;s transcriptions of his tabletop gaming sessions with a group of friends. Lodoss War is one of the best retro anime available. Although it&#39;s a fairly standard Good vs. Evil story with little ambiguity, thanks to how the Fantasy genre has changed in the three decades since Lodoss War debuted, watching it now actually makes it a major change of pace. It&#39;s an amazingly straightforward High Fantasy story presented with the utmost sincerity. On top of that, it has a fantastic art style that still holds up and some genuinely awesome opening and closing themes.
Ryo Mizuno is also the author of Lodoss War&#39;s spiritual successor Record of Grancrest War

 2  That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Follows the Adventures of an Unlikely Hero 
Based on the novels by Fuse.
        

Isekai anime where the main character is reincarnated as a low-level monster rather than a powerful hero are becoming increasingly common. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is the best example of the premise. This is thanks to the series following that hero&#39;s growth from minor monster to powerful leader of a large number of companions. Rimuru gradually becomes one of the most powerful Isekai heroes. Rimuru&#39;s progression and growth feel earned over the course of a journey that contains plenty of humor, along with genuine moments of powerful emotion and compelling action.

 1  KonoSuba is a Triumph of the Isekai Genre 
Based on the novels by Natsume Akatsuki.


 







KonoSuba has become one of the most popular Isekai anime. That reputation is well-earned. It&#39;s a well-written and consistently hilarious parody of the Fantasy genre. Although each of the main characters fits into the role of an established RPG class, their skills are actually terribly suited for those roles. Megumin, for example, is a master of Explosion Magic, but only Explosion Magic. Her spells hit hard, but take so much of her energy that she can only cast one spell before collapsing from exhaustion. This requires the group to utilize schemes based on lateral thinking that manage to be both very clever and very entertaining to watch unfold. KonoSuba is easily among the best comedic Isekai series. KonoSuba&#39;s third season is slated to debut in 2024.
KonoSuba&#39;s full Japanese title is Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o!, which translates in English to &#34;A Blessing on This Wonderful World&#34;.
