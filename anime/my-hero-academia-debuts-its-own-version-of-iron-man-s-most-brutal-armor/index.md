## Literature Review

My Hero Academia reveals that one student has used her powers to create her own version of the War Machine suit first designed by Tony Stark.





Momo Yaoyorozu is also known as Creati, a name taken from her Quirk&#39;s ability to construct almost anything she can imagine out of excess body fat. Momo has used this for a variety of things over the series&#39; run, such as disguises, electric-proof tarps, and even cannons. What fans may never have expected, however, was to see her ability used to create a shoulder-mounted minigun and cannon, with the full intent of mowing down the opposition in huge numbers. My Hero Academia&#39;s heroes aren&#39;t supposed to kill, after all, and the students certainly aren&#39;t. However, the desperate situation and the nature of the enemy made a shoulder-mounted minigun the best possible option.





 Momo&#39;s New Look In My Hero Academia Is A Homage To War Machine 
          

Aside from the minigun, Momo did make some (admittedly crude) armor to help protect herself as well as Mei Hatsume, who was hard at work trying to keep UA&#39;s floating campus in the air. The overall effect gives Momo the look of a half-finished version of Iron Man&#39;s War Machine, with the minigun even mounted on her left shoulder, the way War Machine&#39;s is typically portrayed in the comics. Knowing series creator Kohei Horikoshi is a big fan of Western comics, and Marvel in particular, the homage is almost certainly intentional. Momo apparently used this killer weaponry to take out hordes of Twice clones, something she could do since the clones aren&#39;t actually people, and thus the &#34;no-kill&#34; rule did not apply.

          




Tony Stark originally created the War Machine armor for his best friend Jim Rhodes, so that he could take his place while Tony was paralyzed and faked his death. It was the early 1990s, and big guns were all the rage in superhero comics, as the medium tried to become more &#34;edgy&#34; to appeal to new audiences. War Machine&#39;s design took that by heart, showing an array of deadly weapons that Iron Man usually shunned. Despite the times changing, War Machine is still an important character in the Marvel Universe so the reference in this chapter of My Hero Academia is extremely cool, and had fans lamenting that they weren&#39;t able to see more of Momo&#39;s epic defense of Hatsume. Characters like Todoroki and Ida and even Aoyama have gotten their moments to shine throughout the Final War arc, but Momo (and many of the other female students) have been left out.



 Momo Deserves Her Time To Shine In My Hero Academia 
          




In some ways, the decision makes sense; the pacing for the Final War has already been quite slow, with the story split across many different battlefields. It&#39;s just frustrating for fans of Momo and the other students who&#39;ve been out-of-focus to know that they did have cool moments, they just happened offscreen. Momo&#39;s War Machine-style look definitely came as a surprise, but it was really a brilliant answer to the kind of situation that they found themselves in. Momo&#39;s Quirk makes her potentially one of the most dangerous and deadly students of Class 1-A, but she rarely has the opportunity to really show what she&#39;s made of. Fans can only hope that Momo&#39;s War Machine rampage gets animated when this chapter of My Hero Academia gets adapted for the anime.
