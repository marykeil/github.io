## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 is officially in production, and here&#39;s everything known about it so far from its story details to its release date.




Following the season 2 finale, it was announced that Jujutsu Kaisen officially had a third season in production, which is set to adapt the Culling Game arc of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga. 2023 was definitely a great year for Jujutsu Kaisen, and it’s already being set up for a repeat of that success sometime in the future.




2023 saw the long-awaited premiere of Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, and with its amazing direction and story material, it ended up being even better than season 1. Add in all the incredible developments that happened in the manga as it progressed through its final arc, and 2023 was easily the biggest year for Jujutsu Kaisen yet.

          

At the moment, information on Jujutsu Kaisen season 3’s production is very sparse, but there’s still plenty of information worth discussing, whether it’s based on what was done in the previous two seasons or anything that takes the material of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga into account.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Ending Explained   Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Season 2 finale introduced viewers to a lot of important new information and dramatically shifted the series&#39; status quo.   





 The Latest Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3 News 
          

At the time of writing, the only real news about Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 is that it’s officially greenlit. Season 3 was only confirmed immediately after the season 2 finale, so, naturally, there isn’t going to be a lot of news about it at this time, besides the fact that it will adapt the Culling Game, following the progression of the manga&#39;s story. Once season 3 is further along in production, however, more information is bound to come out as its eventual release date approaches, and that information will be released accordingly.



 When Will Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3 Be Released &amp; Who Is Producing It? 
          




Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 is confirmed to be another Studio MAPPA production, despite the controversies surrounding season 2. Still, considering all the staff changes that happened between season 1 and season 2, there’s no guarantee that Shota Goshozono, Sayaka Koiso, and Yoshimasa Terui will return for direction, character design, and composition, respectively. As for the release date, since Studio MAPPA is likely prioritizing projects like Lazarus and the Chainsaw Man movie, it’s unlikely that Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 will air in 2024, so it should be expected to premiere in 2025, at the earliest. 



 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3’s Story Details Explained 
          

As the subtitle for Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 implies, it will be an adaptation of the Culling Game arc of the manga. Following the Shibuya Incident, Kenjaku, the true identity of the sorcerer who stole Geto’s body, engineers a nationwide fight to the death between sorcerers, designed to elevate the collective cursed energy of Japan to the point that its population can be fused into a massive cursed spirit. The Culling Game arc introduced a bevy of characters and story developments that added a lot to Jujutsu Kaisen as it entered its final stretch, and it will be great to see all that play out in animation, as well.




As for how much of the Culling Game arc will be adapted, that’s also easy to estimate. The first two seasons each adapted roughly eight to nine volumes of the manga, so with Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 ending at volume #16, season 3 will likely go up to volume #25 of the manga and the return of a fan-favorite character. In addition to being consistent with the pacing, ending season 3 there would be a perfect cliffhanger to get people excited for an inevitable fourth season.



 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3 Trailer 

 

Following the season 2 finale, a short trailer for Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 was released to announce its development. The Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 trailer didn’t show much, only having a few lines explaining the basic premise of the Culling Game arc being voiced with some of the manga art animated, but once production is further along, there will undoubtedly be a more extensive trailer for people to watch.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3 Cast 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 has only just been greenlit, but the handful of characters who survived the events of season 2 can all be expected to return. Among those characters, the most notable Jujutsu Kaisen cast members who should return for season 3 are Junya Enoki as Yuji Itadori, Yuma Uchida as Megumi Fushiguro, Takahiro Sakurai as Kenjaku, Junichi Suwabe as Ryomen Sukuna, Noriko Hidaka as Yuki Tsukumo, and Megumi Ogata as Yuta Okkotsu. Season 3 will also introduce major characters like Higuruma, Takaba, Naoya, and Kashimo, and when their voice actors are revealed, that information will be reported accordingly.



 Where To Watch Jujutsu Kaisen Season 3 
          




Since there’s no confirmation of Jujutsu Kaisen season 3’s release date, there’s also no confirmation of where it will be streaming. In all likelihood, Crunchyroll will stream season 3 just like they streamed the first two seasons and Jujutsu Kaisen 0, but it’s not impossible that Crunchyroll would lose the rights to another streaming service like Netflix or Hulu in the time it takes for season 3 to come out. All of that, of course, is purely speculative. Be sure to check this page periodically as any new updates surrounding Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 will be reported as soon as they’re readily available.

Seasons 1 and 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen and the movie Jujutsu Kaisen 0 are available on Crunchyroll.
