# One Piece Confirms A Major Theory About Luffy s Father


## SUMMARY 



  Chapter 1097 of One Piece reveals that Dragon is a former marine who left the Navy to become a revolutionary because he disagreed with the Navy&#39;s idea of justice.   Dragon only spent a short time in the Navy, but he learned to handle weapons during his time there.   While Dragon&#39;s rank and length of service in the Navy are still unknown, it is likely that he could have risen to the top like Garp if he had stayed.

## Literature Review

After years in the shadows, One Piece has finally revealed a key detail about Dragon that confirms one of the biggest theories about him.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for chapter 1097 of One Piece. One Piece has finally confirmed a major theory about Luffy&#39;s father which could change the way fans view the leader of the Revolutionary Army forever. Dragon has always remained an enigma, with little known about his devil fruit or his origins despite decades having passed since his introduction and multiple appearances over the years. Fortunately, the latest chapter of One Piece may have finally revealed a crucial piece of the puzzle.




Chapter 1097 of One Piece sees Dragon make another rare appearance albeit in a flashback. The chapter gives fans a look into the Revolutionary Army&#39;s activities following the God Valley Incident and with it, a key piece of information about Dragon&#39;s mysterious origins prior to forming the Revolutionary Army, finally confirming a popular theory about the mysterious revolutionary.

 One Piece Reveals Monkey Dragon is a Former Marine 
          

Chapter #1097 of One Piece reveals that Dragon is indeed a former marine and that he left the Navy to become a revolutionary instead because he did not agree with the Navy&#39;s idea of justice. Dragon also reveals he only spent a little time in the Navy, and it is there that he learned to handle weapons. While Dragon&#39;s rank within the Navy and how long he spent there are yet to be revealed, it may be safe to assume based on his strength that he likely could have risen to the top much like Garp had he stayed.




Countless theories have popped up over the years regarding Dragon. However, the theory that he was a marine and grew disillusioned with the Navy and the World Government has been the most popular with many fans speculating the involvement of Luffy&#39;s mother in this process. Much like Garp, Aokiji, and Fujitora, Dragon seems to also disagree with the Navy&#39;s concept of Absolute Justice most prominently followed by Fleet Admiral Akainu. Thus, while this revelation may not come as a shock to most fans it certainly fills a major gap in Dragon&#39;s character.

          

Fans have also speculated that Dragon might&#39;ve been one of the Admirals alongside Akainu, Borsalino, and Aokiji. While Aokiji and the newly introduced Admiral Rokugyu managed to climb the hierarchical ladder within the Navy fairly quickly, it seems unlikely that Dragon would remain the unknown figure that he has he acquired such a prestigious rank within the army. Moreover, as Garp reveals in chapter 1087, Dragon had already left and become a revolutionary before Aokiji could even become a Vice Admiral. Having said that, Dragon might have very well been among the candidates for a Vice Admiral position which could also possibly explain the origins of his devil fruit, if he does possess one at all.




Nonetheless, while the latest chapter has confirmed one popular theory, there are yet many questions left to answered about the mysterious Monkey D. Dragon, especially regarding his signature face tattoo. As for now, fans can only wait in silent anticipation that One Piece will answer all in due time.
