## Literature Review

Pokémon isn&#39;t always as happy as fans remember. Often, its characters have the saddest backstories, as seen with Cubone, Charmander, and Team Rocket.




Pokémon is well known for its fun and optimistic tone, but some of the anime series&#39; best stories are also its most tragic and heartbreaking. It encourages its characters and viewers alike to keep chasing their dreams no matter how difficult they may be. However, with all these triumphs and heartwarming friendships, it’s easy to forget where many of the characters started.
Neither Pokémon nor humans are spared from tragedy in their backgrounds. Whether they’re still grieving for their lost families, suffered a damaging relationship, or been rejected by society, many characters are carrying a lot of pain with them on their journeys. It’s a stark reminder that the Pokémon world isn’t quite as bright and cheerful as it seems.









 








 10  Jessie And James&#39; Tragic Backstories Make Them More Complex 
Pokémon Indigo League


 







There are several reasons why Jessie and James have gotten along so well for so long, as demonstrated in Team Rocket’s most iconic Pokémon scenes. One of them is that they can relate to each other’s feelings of loneliness and rejection. They might come from vastly different backgrounds, but the core of their issues is the same.
Jessie grew up horrifically poor, with no father in the picture to begin with and her loving mother, a Team Rocket operative, abandoning her for the sake of a mission. James came from money, but ran away to escape his abusive parents and, even worse, arranged fiancée. The two of them are each other’s only human friends, and it’s no wonder why they were so quick to befriend Meowth, another unloved kindred spirit.





 9  Mewtwo&#39;s Movie Origin Makes His Motivations More Understandable 
The Uncut Story of Mewtwo&#39;s Origin


 







As the very first cloned Pokémon, whose creators had anything but its best interests at heart, Mewtwo had a rough go of it from the beginning. According to “The Uncut Story of Mewtwo’s Origin,” its struggles with life begin right in the vat, as Mewtwo befriends the other clones in the lab only for all their bodies to fail and die. Its grief is so powerful that the scientists must wipe its memory to keep it from destroying the lab.
Not that it wouldn’t end up doing that anyway: killing its creators in the process, in rage at being made only as an experiment. Giovanni makes everything worse by pretending to be its friend first, only to reveal later on that he’s tricked Mewtwo into acting as a weapon for him. After the first few weeks of life he’s had, it’s not surprising that after breaking free of Giovanni’s control, Mewtwo immediately sets about trying to free every other Pokémon from humans, too.





 8  Sabrina&#39;s Sad Backstory Created the Series&#39; Creepiest Gym Leader 
Pokémon Indigo League
        

Sabrina doesn’t quite crack the ranks of the creepiest kids in anime, but she certainly comes close. Unable to control her psychic powers as a child, Sabrina grows up unable to relate normally to other people and lashes out with her powers. She turns her mother into a doll for displeasing her and her father jumps ship, abandoning her.
As a teenager, the effects of her atypical upbringing are obvious. Unlike her game incarnation, she lacks maturity and loves to taunt and torment the people unlucky enough to wander into her gym. It&#39;s only after Ash successfully beats her and frees his friends from her powers that the more innocent side of her personality is able to break through again.





 7  Larvitar Showed How Poachers Can Affect Pokémon 
Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver
        

Even Pokémon who only appear in a few episodes of the show can have standout tragic backstories. This is the case with the Larvitar that fell under Ash’s care in the Johto region. It was only an unhatched egg with Ash and company found it, but it had already been kicked thoroughly around by life.
Larvitar&#39;s mother was attacked by Pokémon poachers who wanted to kidnap her egg, before it was taken far away. Even after the poachers lost it, it was battered around and nearly shattered, with only pure luck bringing it safely to Professor Elm’s lab. On the journey to reunite with its mother on Mount Silver, it has two run-ins with Team Rocket and is nearly kidnapped again, though this time it has its new friends to protect it.





 6  Mallow Shows How Pokémon Can Handle Tough Topics Well 
Pokémon Sun &amp; Moon
        

Ash meets Mallow as he explores the Alola region, eventually revealing her to be one of the Ultra Guardians. Though she’s a cheerful Trainer now, her backstory holds a pain more familiar to viewers than the more fantastical elements of the Pokémon world. As a hurt and prematurely grieving child, she said something in a moment of grief that she regrets for the rest of her life.
When she was younger, Mallow’s mother was deathly ill, her sickness causing her to miss many important events in her children’s lives. Mallow, not knowing how to deal with her mother’s impending death, impulsively shouted at her mother that she hated her for constantly apologizing for her illness and ran away. When she returned, her mother had died, and she was so ashamed of her last words to her that she tries to avoid seeing her mom’s spirit in “Memories in the Mist!”





 5  Lillie&#39;s Fear of Pokémon Gives Her a Great Arc 
Pokémon Sun &amp; Moon
        

In a world that revolves around Pokémon, having a phobia of them is downright debilitating. Poor Lillie loves Pokémon, but absolutely cannot handle physical contact with them, in stark contrast to her game incarnation, who keeps her beloved Nebby close at all times. In the episode “A Masked Warning!”, viewers find out why in one of Pokémon’s darkest moments.
As a small child, Lillie was attacked by Ultra Beast Nihilego, a Pokémon whose venom causes catastrophic damage to the victim’s body and mind. Viewers get a very clear picture of the before and after of a Nihilego attack with Lusamine, who was turned into a shell of her former self. Between the loss of both parents, her brother abandoning her out of guilt for being too afraid to help, and the resulting trauma, Lillie is in an awful place before meeting Ash.





 4  Tepig&#39;s Past Abuse Proves Ash&#39;s Incredible Kindness 
Pokémon Black &amp; White
        

Ash regularly rescues his strongest Fire type Pokémon from abusive situations, and his Pignite is sadly no exception. Back when it was a little Tepig, it lost a battle. Its ​​​​​​trainer, Shamus, didn’t just abandon it, he tied Tepig&#39;s mouth shut and bound it to a post before he left, leaving Tepig unable to eat even after it gets free.
Shamus’ manipulative treatment of Tepig continues to affect it even after it’s bonded with Ash. He pretends to have released it only for its own good and be hurt to have to leave it, only to reveal that this is an act he pulls on all the Pokémon he abandons — an unknown number who may not have been lucky enough to be found by kind humans in time. Viewers more than sympathize when Tepig evolves into Pignite out of sheer rage and burns Shamus’ face.





 3  Meowth Was Judged For Trying to Be More Human 
Pokémon Indigo League


 







Meowth’s earliest memory is waking up alone, with no friends or family around. It doesn’t get better for the unfortunate Scratch Cat Pokémon from there. In one of the most tragic anime backstories, it looks everywhere it can for acceptance and friendship, only to be met with hardship at every turn instead.
Even the reason why Meowth is one of the only Pokémon that knows how to speak human has a sad origin. It was trying to impress a well-to-do Meowth named Meowzie, a human’s pet Pokémon, but Meowzie found Meowth&#39;s new skill freakish and rejected it in favor of a stronger, evolved Persian. At this point, Meowzie had been abandoned by her own Trainer but was still quick to look down on Meowth and treat it as below her.





 2  Charmander Nearly Died From Neglect 
Pokémon Indigo League
        

Shamus and Paul may have been cruel to their Fire types, but the former Trainer of Ash’s Charizard came the closest to actually killing his poor Pokémon. If the flame on a Charmander’s tail is ever extinguished, it will die. So Damian leavingCharmander out in the rain for being too weak in the episode “Charmander - The Stray Pokémon” is astoundingly cruel, and only makes Charmander’s determination to please its Trainer even after Damian’s neglect necessitated it being rushed to a Pokémon Center more heartwrenching.
As a Charmeleon and Charizard, it went through a rebellious phase, refusing to engage in battle it deemed beneath it, even when this had serious consequences for Ash. But in the episode “Charizard Chills,” Ash risks his life to save a frozen Charizard, who was badly weakened by Water and Ice attacks. It reminds Charizard of how Ash earned its friendship and respect in the first place, and it returns to loyally fighting for its true Trainer.





 1  Cubone is Destined to Be the Saddest Pokémon 
Pokémon Origins
        

Famously, each game’s Pokédex has tidbits about Pokémon that range from disturbing to depressing. Cubone, the Lonely Pokémon, wears the skull of its deceased mother on its head, and holds its treasured bone in memory of her. While Ash and company never have to help a Cubone deal with this tragedy, the anime does find an opportunity to bring it up.
In Pokémon Origins, Team Rocket attempts to poach a mother Marowak and her baby Cubone. When Marowak tries to protect her offspring, the poachers hit her with a stun baton hard enough to kill her. Though the newly orphaned baby was adopted by the kindly Mr. Fuji, it remained angry and distrustful of any other humans after humans took its mother from it. As if it was any surprise, Cubone truly has the saddest backstory in the Pokémon anime&#39;s history.
