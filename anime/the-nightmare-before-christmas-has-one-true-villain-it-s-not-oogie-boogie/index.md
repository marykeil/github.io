# The Nightmare Before Christmas Has One True Villain, &amp; It s Not Oogie Boogie


## SUMMARY 



  The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Battle for Pumpkin King introduces a new Disney villain, revealing that Oogie Boogie&#39;s evil nature was influenced by the previous Pumpkin King, Edgar.   Edgar&#39;s manipulation and refusal to let go of his role as Pumpkin King make him the true villain of the story, as his actions lead to Oogie Boogie becoming a vengeful and selfish character.   Without Edgar&#39;s interference, Oogie Boogie could have remained a good character and maintained his friendship with Jack, but Edgar&#39;s control and unfairness ultimately unlock Oogie&#39;s evil potential.

## Literature Review

Oogie Boogie may be the main antagonist of the film, but a new manga published by TokyoPop reveals how his evil potential was unlocked.




While Oogie Boogie may be known as the primary villain of The Nightmare Before Christmas, a new Disney manga reveals the story&#39;s true villain. The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Battle for Pumpkin King introduces the previous Pumpkin King who preceded Jack in the position. The original film&#39;s core villain was encouraged to become the villain he is through the nefarious planning of another character.




The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Battle for Pumpkin King, published by TokyoPop, has the creative team of Deborah Allo, Roberto Scalia, Don Conner, D. J. Milky, and Shaun McLaughlin. The story details how Jack Skellington became the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town.

          

A fierce competition is ignited between Jack and his best friend, Oogie Boogie, that threatens to tear them forever apart. However, the separation is not entirely Oogie&#39;s fault.


 Oogie Boogie Was Influenced By A Brand New Disney Villain 
          

The previous Pumpkin King, Edgar, is preparing to retire from his role. To choose a successor, a competition is held between the two candidates nominated by the citizens of Halloween Town: Jack Skellington &amp; Oogie Boogie. However, Edgar is not prepared to let go of his role completely. He enjoys the control he gets to exercise over the town, resulting in him siding with Oogie Boogie and helping him cheat in the competition. This will allow him to use the future villain as a puppet who obeys his wishes. Yet Edgar&#39;s assistance doesn&#39;t result in Oogie being victorious, leaving the youth to become vengeful.




Although Oogie Boogie would eventually become an iconic Disney villain, he previously had a very happy life with Jack being his best friend. However, his competitive nature is exploited by Edgar, and his worst traits are exasperated to the point where he appears to be beyond redemption in some ways. He is unwilling to play by the rules, becomes extra selfish, and blames everyone else for his failure to become Pumpkin King. Yet this would never have happened had Edgar been fair about the competition from the beginning. If he hadn&#39;t encouraged poor sportsmanship and tried to stay in control, Oogie Boogie likely could&#39;ve stayed friends with Jack long-term.

                  Disney&#39;s Most Underrated Villain Stars in New Darkwing Duck Spinoff   Dynamite Comics has been releasing several Disney-inspired series and this trend is slated to continue this Fall with Darkwing Duck&#39;s nemesis.   

Edgar&#39;s influence and refusal to move on with his life results in Halloween Town having a bigger villain in its future, effectively making Edgar himself the true villain of the story. Without his influence, Oogie Boogie could have stayed a largely good character instead of an isolated agitator. Additionally, the former Pumpkin King is responsible for encouraging Oogie to team up with Lock, Shock, and Barrel, bringing the future villain his own mischievous henchmen. Had he focused on what was genuinely good for Halloween Town, he would&#39;ve let the competition play out and then become a true mentor to the victor. Oogie Boogie may be the villain in The Nightmare Before Christmas, but The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Battle for Pumpkin King proves Edgar is responsible for unlocking his evil potential.
