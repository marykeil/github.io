# Gundam Build Metaverse Review A 10 Year Anniversary Celebration Wasted on a 3 Episode Commercial


## SUMMARY 



  Gundam Build Metaverse fails to live up to its potential as a 10-year anniversary celebration, offering forgettable characters, scripts, and battles.   The focus on fan service and familiar faces sacrifices originality and any meaningful exploration of the Gundam universe.   Instead of capturing the magic of the original Gundam Build Fighters, the series becomes a promotional tool for plastic models, leaving fans disappointed and longing for a &#34;real&#34; mecha show.

## Literature Review

Despite being a major milestone for the Gundam Build sub-franchise, the new ONA is a low-effort montage of cameos and poorly disguised advertisements.




October 2023 marked the online release of Gundam Build Metaverse, which, despite its place as an anniversary celebration, doesn&#39;t engender much cheer. The three episodes, available on the Gundaminfo YouTube channel, bring various characters from the Build sub-franchise together on one screen, but little else. Ultimately, it&#39;s a toyetic display of upcoming plastic models that Bandai-Namco hopes will send the &#34;loyal, true fans&#34; sprinting to stores.




The Build series has always garnered fans for the parts of Gundam that exists outside the stories. With its 10-year anniversary, there was a good opportunity to show that self-awareness again. Sadly, it was wasted, and what viewers will be treated to is forgettable characters, forgettable scripts, and forgettable battles: a trifecta of letdowns.

 Metaverse Exists in Promises, and Not The Show Itself

Sunrise spends an hour rushing through as many familiar faces as possible, while sacrificing any original idea as mere vehicles to revisit the past. Such sacrifice is encapsulated in Rio Hojo, the ostensible protagonist, who mostly exists to mandatorily gush about Gunpla and shout in surprise that he&#39;s meeting more popular, more interesting people. Even his â€“ and therefore, the anime&#39;s - signature machine, the Lah Gundam, lacks any personality, or interesting features, as if there was a mandate not to overshadow the cameos. All the while, the villain almost introduces an interesting emotional conflict but lacks the time to create it.




&#34;Fanservice&#34; is the name of the game for the three episodes. The concept of all the previous Gundam Build sequels unifying into a canonical timeline had promise, but it mostly exists to brush anachronisms under the rug in the name of shout-outs. Continuity is absent, just a chance for Sunrise to showcase recognizable characters, purely for fanservice. Even Reiji, who makes an appearance in the last episode, merely says he can &#34;somehow&#34; appear exactly as he did originally. Any interaction between cameos mostly amounts to meager hellos and goodbyes.

          

Sunrise has for years tried to recreate the magic of the original Gundam Build Fighters, which was self-aware enough to not take itself seriously and affectionate enough of Gundam itself to win hearts. Yet to celebrate its milestone, the characters are told to shill merchandise, shouting their model names loudly, so buyers will know what to get, before flying into limply animated battle scenes. While advertising plastic models with short animations is business as usual for Sunrise, it doesn&#39;t change the fact Gundam Build Metaverse was a missed opportunity, leaving fans to simply wait for the next &#34;real&#34; mecha show.
