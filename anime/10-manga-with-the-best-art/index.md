 9  Kingdom 
Written and Illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara


 







The Kingdom manga has a lot going for it: the plot, which is set during one of the most interesting points in Chinese history, the rich and diverse characters, and Shin&#39;s incredible and inspiring journey as he gives it his all for his dreams. The story follows Shin, an orphan who joins the army in order to become a Great General after his friend is killed. What truly sets Kingdom apart from other manga series is that it accurately depicts war as the evil and bloody thing it is, and uses incredible and often disturbing art that&#39;s impossible to look away from, no matter how uncomfortable it makes readers.
Kingdom has not been licensed for an English publication, with only the Japanese and French versions available. 






 8  Jagaaan 
Written by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and Illustrated by Kensuke Nishida


 







Jagaaan is an incredibly underrated manga that has been improving its art quality at a rapid pace. It&#39;s a dark shonen series that is written and illustrated by an unknown author. The story is set in a world where tiny aliens possess humans and go on a rampage. Each alien&#39;s abilities manifest differently according to its host. The main character, Shinatarou, has an alien that possesses his hand and gives him the power of a gun. Unfortunately, he is forced to kill his girlfriend after she is possessed by an alien. The only way to revive her is to kill all the other aliens. Thus, he embarks on a brutal and gory path to bring back the one he loves.





 7  Vinland Saga 
Written and Illustrated by Makoto Yukimura


 







The manga that gave birth to one of the best anime in decades, Vinland Saga once again got attention after a successful anime adaptation. Alongside Kingdom, the manga is a pioneer in the historical genre, beautifully balancing historical accuracy and creative freedom. Revolving around Thorfinn Karlsefni, the first European to set foot in North America, Vinland Saga follows his journey but also focuses on his path from a bloodthirsty avenger getting revenge for his father&#39;s death to a pacifist who tries to atone for his sins and all the suffering he&#39;s caused.

 6  Naruto Shippuden 
Written and Illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto


 







Although the Naruto manga featured breathtaking art, Kishimoto&#39;s brilliance really shined when he started working on the story&#39;s timeskip. It picks up right where Naruto left off, as he is trying to get stronger to bring back his best friend Sasuke and defend himself from the villainous Akatsuki who seeks to harness the power of the Nine-Tails that is inside of him. Naruto&#39;s art style isn&#39;t as realistic but is just as gorgeous and detailed, and the fact that the series was consistent for 700 chapters is even more astonishing.

 5  One-Punch Man 
Written ONE and Illustrated by Yusuke Murata


 







It&#39;s a running joke within the One-Punch Man fandom that whichever studio will handle the animation of future chapters will be overwhelmed, and as humorous as it is, there&#39;s some truth to it. Coming close to the photo-realistic art of Yusuke Murata, and doing hundreds of frames is impossible, and the manga&#39;s art will always manage to one-up the animation team. One-Punch Man&#39;s action-packed story is elevated by the expressive and realistic art that is burned into your memory just by how gorgeous it is.

 2  Oyasumi PunPun 
Written and Illustrated by Inio Asano


 







In the manga Oyasumi PunPun, the story revolves around a young boy who is portrayed as a bird and his journey through life. While the initial premise may not sound as thrilling as other popular shonen and seinen manga, it would be a grave mistake for fans to pass over this masterpiece.

 1  Vagabond 
Written and Illustrated by Takehiko Inoue


 







Takehiki Inoue has always been an incredible artist and storyteller, but his greatest work, Vagabond, elevated his name to great heights. The series is a dramatized biography of Masashi Miyamoto, a Japanese swordsman and philosopher from the 15th century. The story follows the path of a troubled and violent man to an enlightened and kind philosopher as he battles other swordsmen to become the strongest under the sun.
