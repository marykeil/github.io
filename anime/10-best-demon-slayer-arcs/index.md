## Literature Review

Demon Slayer has amazed fans with its incredible plot and characters, but which of its arcs stand out above the others as the series&#39; best?





Demon Slayer became an instant hit among fans of shonen anime. Anime-onlies and those who have completed the manga, which finished in May 2020, all look forward to the final story arcs of the show getting their animated adaptation. The adventures of Tanjiro, Nezuko, and their fellow Demon Slayers only get more exciting with each one.









 








 10  Tsuzumi Mansion Arc - Zenitsu &amp; Inosuke&#39;s Introduction 
Chapters 20 - 27 &amp; Episodes 11 - 14
        

When Tanjiro investigates a kidnapping, he encounters two other warriors who will become his closest companions in the fights ahead. Zenitsu’s Lightning Breathing is extraordinarily powerful already: it’s getting past his extraordinary cowardice that’s the problem. Meanwhile, Inosuke, raised by boars, has a very high opinion of his own strength, just not the self-control to refine it.
The main trio of the show play off each other excellently right away. Tanjiro is, characteristically, largely unfazed by his new friends’ eccentricities, and is mainly concerned with figuring out how they can all work together to defeat the mansion’s demons. His strategy to beat Kyogai, who controls the mansion’s layout with his drums, shows off his prowess in the versatile art of Water Breathing.





 9  Asakusa Arc - Muzan&#39;s Ruthlessness on Full Display 
Chapters 14 - 19 &amp; Episodes 8 - 10
        

Kibutsuji Muzan makes a horrifying impression in the first episode, slaughtering Tanjiro’s entire family and leaving Nezuko monstrously transformed. However, it’s not until later that the true depths of his ruthlessness are shown. Finding him masquerading as a human, complete with an oblivious wife and daughter, is as horrifying to the audience as it is to Tanjiro.
The Asakusa Arc also brings genuine sparks of hope that the Kamado siblings will find the peace they’re fighting for. They battle Yahaba and Susamaru side by side (with an extra note of horror that such strong opponents aren’t even close to the worst Muzan has to offer). Finally, Tamayo brings up the first hope that Nezuko can do more than learn to control her demon urges: she can become human again.





 8  Final Selection Arc - Demon Slayer&#39;s First Arc 
Chapters 1 - 9 &amp; Episodes 1 - 5
        

The earliest arc of Demon Slayer is also one of its most memorable. Officially, Tanjiro trains under Urokodaki, a former Hashira who also trained Giyuu. Unofficially, Tanjiro is also taught by the ghosts of Sabito and Makomo, Urokodaki’s previous students killed by demons. The moment Tanjiro proves himself strong enough to finish his year of training, both earning Sabito’s smile and causing him to disappear forever, is both triumphant and moving.
The emotions don’t stop there: Tanjiro carries all of their lessons into the Final Selection exam, a seven-day survival challenge. He even uses them to destroy the Hand Demon that killed Sabito and Makomo, avenging their untimely deaths. His journey to becoming a great Demon Slayer begins on a very bright note.





 7  Swordsmith Village Arc - The Latest Anime Arc Impresses 
Chapters 98 - 127 &amp; Episodes 45 - 55
        

The Nichirin Blades are not only some of the coolest swords in anime, but absolutely essential to a Demon Slayer’s job. Throughout the show, the village of swordsmiths responsible for them has only been hinted at, and now Tanjiro is given the rare privilege of visiting in person. Seeing an entire culture based around forging a very specific kind of blade (and confirming that Haganezuka is an oddball even among them) is very interesting.
The focus on Muichirou Tokito, the Mist Hashira, packs a lot of development into just a few episodes. The story of his and his brother Yuichirou, two of the best twins in anime, is the turning point of the arc, ending in Muichirou regaining his memories and moving beyond his formerly cold and dismissive behavior. Combined with the debut of Mitsuri Kanroji’s beautiful and powerful fighting style, and this is a big arc for Hashira lovers.





 6  Hashira Training Arc - A Unique Twist on the Training Arc 
Chapters 128 - 136
        

To beat Muzan’s strongest demons, Tanjiro and company must train with the best of Demon Slayers. In the lead-up to the final battle, they follow the Hashira to their preferred training grounds, where the top Demon Slayers help the lower ranks improve in each of their own greatest strengths. It’s a training program so intense it strikes fear into the hearts of the entire Corps.
Both average Demon Slayers and the strongest Hashira learn from each other in this unprecedented all-Corps training program. From Uzui’s shinobi-inspired stamina training to Gyomei’s muscle-strengthening regimen, we not only get to see what it takes to be a Hashira, but rejoice in seeing our heroes rise to the challenge.





 5  Mount Natagumo Arc - Demon Slayer&#39;s First tragic Villains 
Chapters 28 - 44 &amp; Episodes 15 - 21
        

This arc is the first of the anime to truly drive home the idea of its demons being some of the most tragic villains in anime. But first, it plays up its prominent horror elements as much as possible as the Demon Slayer Corps are hunted by fearsome spider demons. Their varying powers are difficult to handle alone and near impossible together.
The one responsible is revealed to be the smallest, most unassuming of the demons, Rui. Cold and cruel to the “family” of demons under his control, he is powerful enough to terrorize them and pose an insurmountable obstacle to Tanjiro. But as he’s dying, he regains the memories of his human life, the source of his longing for family as a demon, the first of many tear-jerking demon flashbacks to come.





 4  Mugen Train Arc - The Highest-Grossing Anime Film Ever 
Chapters 55 - 66 &amp; Episodes 27 - 33
        

Notable for being the anime’s first theatrical movie adaptation, the Mugen Train arc just goes to show why “stuck on a train” stories remain so popular. The trio, the Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, and dozens of civilians are trapped on a train by the demon Enmu. They must figure out how to escape Enmu’s powerful illusions and take him down before he devours everyone.
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train shattered box office records when it first premiered. It took the crown of one of the best Studio Ghibli movies as Japan’s highest-grossing film ever made. It’s a toss-up as to which sequence is more memorable: Tanjiro forcing himself to break free of his dream of his dead family, or Kyojuro going through the greatest fight of his career.





 3  Entertainment District Arc - One of Demon Slayer&#39;s Most Intense Fights 
Chapters 67 - 97 &amp; Episodes 34 - 44
        

With a flashy opening (fitting for the introduction of the Corps’ flashiest Hashira), this arc promises an adventure right away. The Sound Hashira, Tengen Uzui, takes Tanjiro and company into the Entertainment District of Tokyo to hunt down a demon targeting young women. Infiltrating in disguise, the Demon Slayers discover that the threat is greater than they feared.
The heart of the show is Tanjiro and Nezuko’s bond as the only surviving siblings of the Kamado family. This arc’s villains, siblings Gyutaro and Daki, represent what they could have been if they had grown up without a loving and supportive family. As they die, Tanjiro recognizes that and tearfully helps them reaffirm their love for each other in their last moments.





 2  Sunrise Countdown Arc - Demon Slayer&#39;s Last Arc 
Chapters 184 - 205
        

The very final arc of Demon Slayer ends the manga on a high note. With the Twelve Kizuki gone, Muzan is the last demon left standing, and the remnants of the Demon Slayer Corps pull out all the stops to outlast him until the sun rises to finally destroy him. Muzan cannot be defeated like any other demon, and the struggle just to survive against him while the clock runs down is nail-bitingly tense.
Muzan being Muzan, he insists upon going out with a spiteful bang. Watching kind and peaceful Tanjiro being transformed into a starving demon is shocking, but one of the prevailing themes of Demon Slayer has always been the inherent strength and resilience of humanity through impossible situations. This time, it’s not just the newly human Nezuko helping Tanjiro: it’s everyone he’s spent the entire series befriending and supporting.





 1  Infinity Castle Arc - Demon Slayer&#39;s Glorious Final Battle 
Chapters 137 - 183
        

While the actual climax of Demon Slayer’s story may be Tanjiro’s transformation into a demon, the all-out fight with Muzan and his last remaining Kizuki that comes before is even more thrilling. The series’ action and heart are what it is best known for, and these chapters deliver both in spades. This easily ranks among one of the most harrowing final battle sequences in manga. The Hashira are built up throughout the series as the strongest of the Demon Slayer Corps, but as seen with Kyojuro, they aren’t invulnerable. By the time the sun rises, most of them will have fought to the death to defend humanity alongside their companions, with each Demon Slayer&#39;s sacrifice uniquely tragic and triumphant at once.
Demon Slayer has earned its runaway popularity. Each story arc reveals more about the world of demons and the warriors who fight them. With a colorful cast and stunning action, it will remain a lastingly impressive work by both mangaka Koyoharu Gotouge and the crew of Ufotable. Demon Slayer&#39;s best arcs prove what makes the series such a massive hit.
