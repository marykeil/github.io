The teaser trailer also revealed that the anime will be animated by the South Korean company Studio Mir. The acclaimed studio animated the majority of The Legend Of Korra and the later seasons of Young Justice. They are not new to adapting video games as they&#39;ve also made Dota: Dragon&#39;s Blood and Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#39;s Revenge. Together with Adi Shankar, the director of Castlevania, the series is in very capable hands. The cast and staff haven&#39;t made public yet but fans can expect it due to the hype surrounding the series.

At the rate Netflix is going, they are poised to become one of the biggest if not the biggest company in the anime industry. Anime is becoming ever more popular globally, and Netflix isn&#39;t the only company capitalizing on this, as Adult Swim have invested in anime for decades. Given that anime has often been treated as a niche outside of Japan, the medium&#39;s mainstream success recently has proven to be a great boon for fans. Previously, anime adaptations of games might not reach the biggest audience possible, but in the wake of hits like Netflix&#39;s Castlevania, these anime adaptations of games are appealing to a wider audience.




Devil May Cry is Netflix&#39;s latest addition to its growing anime portfolio, and based off the teaser it looks gorgeous and one to look out for. Fans of the franchise are sure to be pleased with Netflix&#39;s take on the series&#39; signature action and beloved characters. From Tomb Raider: The Legend Of Lara Croft to Castlevania: Nocturne, Netflix have had a great year for anime and its not even done yet. Devil May Cry is already shaping up to be one of Netflix&#39;s finest adaptations.

Devil May Cry will be available exclusively on Netflix.
