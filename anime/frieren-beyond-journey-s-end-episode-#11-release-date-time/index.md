With the major antagonist of its latest arc defeated, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #11 could move the story in many potential directions. It could easily return to the more episodic adventures of its first few installments.

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #10? 
          




Episode #10 focused on the climactic showdown between Frieren and the demon Aura but it also delved deeply into the near immortal Frieren&#39;s past. As a young child, Frieren&#39;s village was destroyed by demons after which the powerful mage Flamme took her under her wing. Under Flamme&#39;s tutelage, Frieren learns to mask her true mana output, causing demons to underestimate her. This gave her an edge in fights and was particularly useful against Aura&#39;s technique. Given Frieren&#39;s massive amount of mana, the elf was able to put the demon in her thrall and order Aura to behead herself, ending that demonic threat.



Demons don&#39;t mask their mana, which allowed Frieren to take Aura by surprise.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #11 Will Start The Next Arc 
          




With the demon threat defeated, Frieren and her party can now continue northward towards the realm of the dead. This will cause the Elf and her companions to encounter more towns with people who need her help. This could return the series to its episodic roots that helped make Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s premiere so great. However, since Aura was a powerful demon, the defeat of her forces could cause other powerful demons to attempt to hunt down Frieren&#39;s party. Both of these outcomes have rich dramatic potential and so either could be a potential direction for the story to develop in.

No matter what happens in the next episode, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End has gained the faith of many fans with the quality of its previous installments. If the series manages to maintain this high standard then it could easily be the best anime of 2023. Thus, even if it is less exciting than episode #10, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #11 will likely still be excellent.

Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #11 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 17, 2023.
