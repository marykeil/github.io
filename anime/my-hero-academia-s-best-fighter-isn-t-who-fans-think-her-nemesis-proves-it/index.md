## Literature Review

My Hero Academia&#39;s best physical fighter might come as a surprise to some fans, but the way she&#39;s consistently handled her nemesis proves her skill.




When it comes to fighting other people, one My Hero Academia student has taken a massive leap past her peers, and it&#39;s all thanks to a little fighting style known as Gunhead Martial Arts. With all of the series&#39; many powerful heroes, it might be easy for fans to forget that Uraraka is actually a skilled martial artist who could beat almost any other hero in hand-to-hand combat.




When Ochaco Uraraka went on her week-long internship after the Sports Festival, she ended up interning with a hero known as Gunhead, who turned out to be a surprisingly cool mentor. Ochaco spent most of her week learning Gunhead&#39;s signature fighting style, Gunhead Martial Arts, and she picked it up quite quickly. Ochaco would go on to maintain her training in Gunhead Martial Arts, and it rapidly became one of her greatest assets. In fact, nothing has proven how valuable her knowledge of Gunhead Martial Arts has been to her than the frequent run-ins she&#39;s had with Himiko Toga.


 Gunhead Martial Arts Should Be Taught to Every UA Student 
          

As it turns out, Gunhead Martial Arts is all about grappling and controlling an opponent&#39;s movements to prevent them from attacking. It&#39;s excellent for disarming opponents as well, and Ochaco has used this against the knife-wielding Toga on several occasions (often shouting &#34;Gunhead Martial Arts!&#34; as she does so). Ochaco&#39;s mastery of Gunhead Martial Arts has undoubtedly saved her life time and time again, giving her the skill and knowledge needed to sidestep enemy attacks and immobilize them. Very few of her fellow students have engaged in any kind of martial arts training (Tailman Mashirao Ojiro being the big exception).




Ochaco&#39;s success with Gunhead Martial Arts actually makes a major point in favor of having some form of martial arts become part of the UA curriculum. Heroes aren&#39;t supposed to kill, after all, so being experts in restraining opponents would be an essential skill. And, while many villains use their Quirks, it&#39;s far from unusual to see villains wielding weapons as well, so the knowledge to disarm them would be incredibly valuable. While the nature of some Quirks, like Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow, might make martial arts less valuable to those students, there could still arise occasions where it&#39;s needed, and the discipline and exercise offered by martial arts would still be rewarding.

While fans may not expect Ochaco to be one of the series&#39; most skilled student fighters, her mastery of Gunhead Martial Arts is a pretty major achievement, especially since she only had a week to train with Gunhead initially. Ochaco understood the importance of these martial arts skills almost immediately, especially in combination with her Quirk, which is already excellent for disorienting opponents. While she may not have come into UA expecting to be a combat hero, Ochaco&#39;s skill certainly places her among My Hero Academia&#39;s best, and nothing proves that more than her defeats of Toga using Gunhead Martial Arts.
