## Literature Review

The conclusion of the Wano Arc in One Piece marks the perfect time for the series to do something it hasn&#39;t done in years: a filler arc.





Back when several popular anime series were released on a weekly schedule, anime filler was a lot more common. Series like Naruto created multiple filler arcs that explored unseen locations and introduced new characters. In contrast, other filler techniques stretched episodes out with dramatic pacing, like Dragon Ball Z did. One Piece has been guilty of both filler methods in its 24 years of broadcast. However, now is the best time for the show to dive into an anime-only story that can give the Straw Hat Crew a short, less intense adventure to demonstrate their growth and comradery before diving into the next epic arc.





 A Filler Arc Would Give One Piece&#39;s Characters Time To Breathe 
          

For a series with over a thousand episodes, One Piece has a shockingly small amount of filler. Several have been promotional episodes that help set up one of the series&#39; films. However, there have been notable exceptions, like the G-8 arc in episodes #196-206. This anime-only story takes place after Skypiea, where the Straw Hats accidentally land in the middle of a fortified Marine base. The arc felt like a breath of fresh air with its focus on comedy and, more importantly, the bonding it gave the characters, something One Piece desperately needs after the intense Wano Arc.

                  Two of One Piece&#39;s Wano Deaths Are More Important Than Fans Think   One Piece&#39;s chapter 1052 reveals that Kozuki Oden&#39;s retainers Ashura Doji and Izo were tragically killed during the battle for Wano Country&#39;s freedom.   




Wano was One Piece&#39;s longest arc by far. It also felt more substantial since pivotal story elements from past arcs all came to a head with the battle against two Pirate Emperors on Wano. Now that Luffy and his crew are not fighting against the clock to rescue a crewmate or working in an alliance to topple brutal dictatorships, the Straw Hats need an arc with fewer nail-biting stakes. If written well, a post-Wano One Piece filler arc could explore how Jimbei&#39;s presence on the crew changes the characters&#39; dynamics.



 One Piece Has Many Options For Filler Arcs 
          

Another excellent method the One Piece anime has used to create enjoyable filler material is animating the manga&#39;s cover stories. Creator Eiichiro Oda has made a habit of telling additional stories in the One Piece world with covers that often feature important events the manga couldn&#39;t fit in. It&#39;s been a while since the anime adapted any cover stories, like how Buggy got his body back in the East Blue and the brutal training that Coby and Helmeppo endured. Animating &#34;Germa 66&#39;s Emotionless Excursion&#34; would also be an effective bridge to some of the events of the Egghead Island arc.




Asking for more filler is an odd request in the anime community, but One Piece is a series that has almost limitless potential to tell fascinating tales. Plus, with Oda recently taking a few breaks to recover from eye surgery and to help with the hit Netflix live-action adaptation, the One Piece anime would benefit significantly by adapting the manga&#39;s cover stories or creating an anime-only filler story that gives its characters more time together in a less stressful environment.
