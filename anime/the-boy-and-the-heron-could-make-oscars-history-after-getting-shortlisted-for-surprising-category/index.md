## Literature Review

Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron continues its record-breaking tour as the Academy shortlists it for at least one Oscar at next year’s award ceremony.




Having already taken the world by storm, Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli&#39;s The Boy and the Heron looks to add the crown jewel of cinematic entertainment to its list of accolades as it has been shortlisted for an Oscar nomination.




Late last week, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released its annual shortlist of nominations for its most prestigious categories. Studio Ghibli&#39;s The Boy and the Heron made the shortlist for the Best Music (Original Score) category. The score was composed by veteran Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi.


 

The success of The Boy and the Heron since its premiere makes it one of the stronger candidates to win the award, but it faces some stiff competition from the likes of Barbie, The Color Purple, and the other animated film in the category, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The final nominations will be released on January 23, 2024, with the winner of the award to be revealed during the Academy Awards ceremony on March 10, 2024.


 The Boy and the Heron Could Bring Home More Than One Oscar 
          




An award in the Best Music category may not be the only Oscar the film takes home, as it is still eligible to compete in the Best Animated Feature category. The shortlist for this category has yet to be announced. Currently, over 30 films are vying for placement on the shortlist, including Western powerhouse franchises such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and of course, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Also on the list are the other stellar Japanese offerings, Suzume, and The First Slam Dunk.

Regardless if it brings home and Academy Award or not, The Boy and the Heron has already made history with prestigious recognition. Less than a month ago, it received nominations for both the Golden Globe Awards for Best Animated Feature and the Best Original Score. Nominated and awarded earlier, the Golden Globes are often used as a barometer for what to expect about the Academy Awards. Regardless of what categories the film is nominated in, the key metric will be how well it does in the Golden Globes. If it wins there, then it&#39;s likely to also be a special day for Miyazaki next March.






 Miyazaki&#39;s Unprecedented History Of Success 
          

Will The Boy and the Heron be flying away with one or more Oscars? Well, if Miyazaki&#39;s history as a director is anything to go by, then the odds are in its favor. Miyazaki&#39;s shelf is loaded with awards for his work on animated films. Widely considered one of the people most responsible for the modern development of Japanese anime, Miyazaki won his first award in 1979, and since then has consistently won or been nominated for the most prestigious awards in entertainment. In 2002, he won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature for Spirited Away. If, as expected, The Boy and the Heron gets nominated for Best Animated Feature, Miyazaki will join Pete Docter as the only two people with four nominations in that category.

The Boy and the Heron is now playing in selected theaters worldwide.
