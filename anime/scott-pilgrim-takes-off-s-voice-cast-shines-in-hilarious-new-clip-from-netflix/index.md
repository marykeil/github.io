## Literature Review

A new clip from the much-anticipated anime Scott Pilgrim Takes Off has arrived and gives the cast from the 2010 film a chance to shine in their roles.





As part of Netflix&#39;s Drop 01 event, a new clip was shared on their Netflix Anime YouTube channel that focuses on one of the story&#39;s most iconic moments. Scott, in an attempt to impress Ramona, orders something in the mail knowing that she&#39;ll be the one to deliver it. This leads to him waiting patiently at the door for her to arrive. It&#39;s as funny and adorable as it was in the comic and film, but it&#39;s made even better hearing the voices of Michael Cera, Kieran Culkin and Aubrey Plaza returning to their roles.

After 13 years, it&#39;s absolutely surreal to hear the same actors from the film recreating one of their best moments. What&#39;s even better though is that it feels like they never left. Michael Cera&#39;s performance as Scott here is as hopelessly romantic as he was in the film while Plaza&#39;s portrayal of Julie continues to delight with her disdain of the story&#39;s protagonist. Then there&#39;s Wallace, one of the standouts from the film. Kieran Culkin continues to shine in this clip as the witty and sarcastic character that made him such a favorite when he played the role in 2010. Based on the performances from these three characters alone, it&#39;s safe to say that the returning cast will be just as on top of their characters as they first were when they brought the story to life under Edgar Wright&#39;s direction.

 Little Differences Make Scott Pilgrim Takes Off Feel Fresh 
          

What&#39;s even better about this clip is how it feels like the same story, but some changes have been included to keep fans on their toes. In this case, the decision to make Ramona work for Netflix as a DVD delivery person is a cute little nod to their new home on Netflix while maintaining the time period the story takes place in. However, the montage of Scott sitting in front of the door waiting for her from the moment he puts the order in is made even funnier when it&#39;s turned into a montage as life goes on, and he just sits there, waiting. It&#39;s been stated before that Scott Pilgrim Takes Off will feature big changes to its story, and if this is what fans have to look forward to, it&#39;s already starting on the right foot.




The new series is expected to drop on November 17, 2023, with every episode releasing at once. The original Scott Pilgrim film left a lot on the table for a future adaptation since it released before the final entry in the graphic novel series came out. Now, with a full look at just how the series will play out through the lens of one of its best moments, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off could become one of 2023&#39;s biggest hits thanks to its sharp adaptation and beloved voice cast.

Check out Scott Pilgrim Takes Off on November 17, 2023, only on Netflix!
