# Jujutsu Kaisen s Anime Villains Are Much More Disturbing Than Their Manga Versions


## SUMMARY 



  Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s anime adds a disturbing implication by showing the Curses playing alongside innocent children, implying they killed or transfigured them later.   Studio MAPPA has made subtle changes to the manga throughout the second season, including expanding fights and fleshing out characters, to enhance the viewing experience.   While the change may be unnecessary, it further characterizes the Curses before the Shibuya Incident and makes them even more disturbing than in the manga.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s anime has made a variety of changes to the manga but its latest adjustment makes the series&#39; main villains even more disturbing.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #8!Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s anime has taken some liberties in adapting the source material in season 2, but one addition makes the series&#39; villains even more disturbing. This is somewhat shocking as mangaka Gege Akutami never shied away from showing the brutality of his villains. However, Studio MAPPA has gone one step further with a subtle but important change.




In Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #8, Jogo has a flashback to when Geto told him a plan to stop Gojo. Geto reveals this plan to him in a park, and the anime shows that the other Curses are frolicking around on a playground as they talk. This playground also contains a variety of children innocently playing alongside the Curses, including Mahito. Given what Mahito and the other Curses are known to do to humans, this implies that they all either killed or transfigured the children when they were done playing. The manga version of this scene still shows the Curses playing together, but it doesn&#39;t feature any children, which makes the scene much less dark.


 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Anime Implies That the Curses Killed Children 
          

This isn&#39;t the first time this season Studio MAPPA has made a subtle change to the manga. The Gojo&#39;s Past arc included some extra scenes fleshing out the plot and characters, such as Mei Mei and Utahime exploring a cursed mansion and Geto making some tea. It also expanded certain fights such as Geto vs. Toji, which made them much more exciting. Despite what some purists may say, these scenes allowed MAPPA to improve Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s source material and make for a better viewing experience overall. It is unclear if the change to Jogo&#39;s flashback is positive, but it certainly is an interesting one.




While it is certainly not out of character for the Curses to murder a group of children, it would be the most disturbing act they committed in the series thus far. It would also completely squash any potential sympathy fans might still have for them. Of course, their actions in the manga also didn&#39;t make it easy to sympathize or root for the Curses, but it never went as far as the anime&#39;s twisted implication. Thus, this change may just be seen as MAPPA trying to shock the audience before the Shibuya Incident reaches its most shocking moments. After all, the anime has already made some of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s twists even more brutal.



 Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Change Is Unnecessary But Important 
          

While this ultimately is an unnecessary change, it does serve to characterize the Curses further before the Shibuya Incident explores their characters even further. This may make many fans prefer the anime&#39;s version of the scene, despite its disturbing implication. No matter how fans feel about this scene, however, the fact remains that with it, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s anime has made the series&#39; villains even more disturbing than in the manga.




Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #8 is available to watch on Crunchyroll.
