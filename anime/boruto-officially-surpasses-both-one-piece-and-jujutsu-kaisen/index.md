## Literature Review

After years of being negatively compared to its predecessor Naruto, Boruto&#39;s part 2 made the series stand out and surpass industry juggernauts.




After years of mixed reception among fans and critics, and negative comparison to its famous predecessor Naruto, it seems that part 2 of Boruto, titled Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, has finally pushed the series in the right direction, letting it surpass best-sellers such as One Piece and Jujutsu Kaisen.




Over the years, a key Boruto metric cited by its detractors as proof of its poor quality has been its inability to outsell its rivals, which was a feat consistently achieved by Naruto. However, in December 2023, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex became the most-read manga on Shueisha&#39;s MANGA Plus website, surpassing One Piece, Chainsaw Man, and Jujutsu Kaisen.

          

MANGA Plus is an online platform where translated versions of manga from Shueisha&#39;s line of Jump manga anthologies - including Shōnen Jump, are published. The site also includes the ranking of the manga titles published on the platform. At the time of writing, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is steadily at the top, distancing Naruto&#39;s old rival One Piece by over 200,000 views. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that both One Piece and Jujutsu Kaisen were on hiatus in the week that Boruto surpassed them.





 Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Is Taking The Series To New Heights 
         

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations launched with about as much hype and fanfare as a manga series could ever hope for its debut. However, within months after its release, complaints that it felt rushed, lacked originality and was nowhere near the quality level of its predecessor began and haven&#39;t stopped. But then Boruto: Two Blue Vortex was released, and all signs point to the series finally living up to the promise it held when it was first released. Boruto has grown up to be the protagonist fans always wanted, coming back after the time skip with a new, edgy attitude and a determination that was never seen before. He&#39;s arguably more interesting of a character than his father was at a similar age. But it&#39;s not just Boruto who has led to the story&#39;s revival.




Much of the credit must go to the supporting characters, who are also coming into their own. Sarada Uchiha has been a fan-favorite character since the beginning of the story. However, Kishimoto&#39;s continuous overshadowing of her by other characters and plots created yet another reason for readers to complain about Boruto. Sarada now has a much bigger role in the story, while hopefully the rest of the Next Gen is also given room to develop. The benefits of this character work have helped revitalize a story many considered way past being stagnant. While memorable characters are essential to the making of a quality manga, they will have little impact if the story isn&#39;t equally exhilarating.



 Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Is A Good Story With Great Characters 
          

Surely, views on MANGA Plus alone should not be considered a sufficient metric of comparison between series. Fans in the West can also read these manga through other official platforms (such as Viz&#39;s Shueisha app) or simply buy physical copies. Also, Japanese fans have completely different ways of enjoying these media. Usually the number of volumes sold in Japan is one of the most important metrics for the success of a series. It will be interesting to see how well Boruto: Two Blue Vortex will do in that regard, and how it will compare to One Piece and Jujutsu Kaisen, once its first volume is published. However, regardless of that, it is undeniable that Two Blue Vortex was exactly the makeover that Boruto needed, and the positive reaction of fans is proof of the series&#39; newfound quality.
