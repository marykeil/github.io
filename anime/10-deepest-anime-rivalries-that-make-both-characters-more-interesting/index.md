## Literature Review

A good anime rivalry not only pits two characters against each other, it emphasizes the differences in their personalities and morals.





Anime lends itself well to contrasting characters. In worlds where overblown physical reactions and a wide range of appearances such as hair colors are the norm, animators can quickly convey to audiences the opposite nature of two characters. Many of the most iconic anime rivalries involve a gruff, dark-haired protagonist who is pitted against an ethereal, light-haired one. Occasionally, rivals look similar but are later revealed to have vastly different personalities. But what would a good rivalry be without different morals? Anime is one of the best mediums for exploring not only good vs. evil, but the many shades of gray that exist in between.









 








 10  Shinya Kogami and Shogo Makishima (Psycho-Pass) 
        

Psycho-Pass is rife with commentary about morality, and the rivalry between Kogami and Makishima only reinforces that. Kogami, a police officer in a dystopian Japan, becomes obsessed with the cold-blooded Makishima after he kills his friend, Sasayama. According to series director Naoyoshi Shiotani, Kogami was developed to be Makishima&#39;s exact opposite -- he&#39;s action-oriented and idealistic, while Makishima is clinical and pedantic. They also have strikingly different character designs; Makishima looks eerily angelic while Kogami is rugged and no-nonsense. The antagonism between them is so strong that their final showdown led to one of the best episodes from Season 1 of Psycho-Pass.





 9  Ash Lynx and Yut-Lung Lee (Banana Fish) 
        

Banana Fish&#39;s Ash and Yut-Lung are rivals that would provide any gender studies professor with months worth of discussion fodder. Ash, a practical and ruthless New York City gang leader, is much more stereotypically masculine than the conniving and temperamental Yut-Lung. As the series progresses, it is revealed that they have both experienced trauma of a deeply horrific and similar nature. The main difference in their recovery was that Ash had friends to help him heal, while Yut-Lung did not. Wistful fans often wonder whether these two would have gotten along, if not for their tug-of-war over Eiji that encompasses the second half of the series. With characters this good, it&#39;s no wonder Banana Fish was ranked as one of the most underrated anime of the past five years.





 8  Kotetsu T. Kaburagi and Barnaby Brooks, Jr. (Tiger and Bunny) 
        

Unevenly-matched superhero duos are a popular TV trope for good reason. A classic example is Tiger and Bunny&#39;s Kotetsu and Barnaby, who are paired together to fight crime and boost ratings for Sternbild&#39;s popular television program, Hero TV. Kotetsu, about to age out of his job, has a traditional view of heroism that he balances with being a dad, while Barnaby, the younger of the two, brings fresh insights to their work that often drive Kotetsu crazy. While their relationship is much more of a reluctant friendship than a rivalry, there&#39;s always a good laugh to be had when these two characters butt heads.





 7  Kenzo Tenma and Johan Liebert (Monster) 
        

Monster follows Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a surgeon who saved a gunshot victim who turned out to be the killer Johan Liebert. Tenma&#39;s crisis of conscience around the matter immediately contrasts him with the series&#39; titular monster. Over the course of 74 episodes, Tenma sticks close to his morals, such as his oath never to kill. Meanwhile, Johan spends the series on something of a killing spree. The appearance and personality traits of these characters also couldn&#39;t be more different -- Tenma, exhausted with hunting down Johan, often looks scraggly and unshaven, while Johan maintains a quiet, well-mannered persona that is almost otherworldly.





 6  Alois Trancy and Ciel Phantomhive (Black Butler) 
        

While Season 2 of Black Butler has generated controversy for departing from Yana Toboso&#39;s manga and creating entirely new characters, Alois Trancy has become one of Ciel&#39;s most memorable rivals. At first glance, he appears to be Ciel&#39;s mirror image -- a spoiled rich kid with a demon butler -- but there are subtle differences between the two. One of the eeriest is that Alois&#39; butler, Claude, is far less invested in his master&#39;s welfare than Sebastian is in Ciel&#39;s. While Season 2 is self-contained and possible to skip over, fans are encouraged to tune in for a master class in character foils.





 5  Tohru Honda and Akito Sohma (Fruits Basket) 
        

On a surface level, Fruits Basket&#39;s Tohru and Akito could not be any more different. Tohru, polite and people-pleasing to a fault, is the opposite of the violent and manipulative head of the Sohma clan. At the heart of their opposing personalities, however, is a great deal of emotional trauma that they have experienced separately. The impact of that trauma manifested differently -- Tohru&#39;s made her afraid of ever letting anyone down, while Akito&#39;s led to a desperate and controlling personality, resulting in one of the most tragic villains in anime. Remarkably, these two resolve their conflict with each other by the end of the series, but not without some substantial sacrifices.





 4  Sesshomaru and Inuyasha (Inuyasha) 
        

One of the best storytelling techniques, when revealing a character has a sibling, is to show the ways in which those siblings are different. Sesshomaru and Inuyasha are the poster children for sibling rivalries -- the former cold and imperious, the latter fiery and stubborn. Many of their disagreements are due to their parentage; Sesshomaru is a full-fledged demon dog while Inuyasha is half-human. The information audiences get about their upbringing and their parents&#39; modes of showing love could fill several psychology textbooks. While Inuyasha&#39;s main mission is to capture the Shikon jewel shards, the rivalry with his half-brother is equally, if not more, interesting.





 3  Katsuki Bakugo and Izuku Midoriya (My Hero Academia) 
        

It&#39;s difficult to think of two characters who contrast more clearly than Bakugo and Deku. Deku, gentle and idealistic, is often on the wrong side of Bakugo&#39;s hotheaded remarks. Once childhood friends, Bakugo&#39;s competitive streak and disdain for anyone Quirkless made Deku an easy target for his wrath. In five, going on six seasons of the anime, Deku has proven those who have underestimated him wrong countless times, but Bakugo is a tsundere and still a tough shell to crack. Still, Deku works to demonstrate kindness towards the friend who turned on him, and there is potential for these two to make amends yet.





 2  L Lawliet and Light Yagami (Death Note) 
        

L and Light are a classic example of anime foils and one of the best rivalries in a shonen anime. While their appearances certainly differ, they are actually more similar than first impressions would suggest. For example, while L is certainly not out to kill people, it&#39;s difficult to argue that he&#39;s on the side of pure good, either. He approaches his mission to stop Kira as one would a chess game or any other mentally stimulating puzzle. Light, while worried that his identity as Kira will be found out, also seems to get a perverse thrill out of outwitting the world&#39;s greatest detective. In many ways, they are perfectly suited for each other in their perpetual game of cat-and-mouse.





 1  Guts and Griffith (Berserk) 
        

Berserk has been heralded as a masterpiece since 1989, and one of the biggest reasons for that is the enthralling rivalry between Guts and Griffith. Initially comrades in the Band of the Hawk, Griffith&#39;s ambition gets in the way and results in one of the most devastating betrayals in anime history. Guts, a man of few words and (until the fateful Eclipse) one without a dream, contrasts sharply with the charismatic and calculating Griffith. The creator, Kentaro Miura, sadly passed away in 2021, but the manga appears to be in good hands with Studio Gaga, who is setting a new standard for series revivals. In other words, fans will likely get a satisfying final showdown between Guts and Griffith that has been in the works for nearly 35 years.
There&#39;s an old saying that jewelers will place shiny foil beneath a gem to make the stone shine brighter, and the same can be said for well-written rivalries in anime. By accentuating how two characters are different, they each must define themselves against the other to stand out in their own right. One of the many reasons that anime is such an impactful means of storytelling is the effort it goes into creating complex characters who challenge each other&#39;s motives, morals, and ways of life. Deep anime rivalries that make both characters more interesting do all that, and more.
