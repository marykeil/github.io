## Literature Review

Sometimes, adult anime fans can exhausted with high school romances and teenage leads. Thankfully, there are plenty of shows for older fans.




Adult anime fans may have a hard time finding series that fit their needs. The world of anime is incredibly vast, covering stories from a variety of genres. From romance to action, and even sci-fi, there&#39;s an anime series for every type of fan. However, for older fans of the expressive animation medium, it can sometimes be hard to find characters to relate to their own lives.
Many popular titles focus on young protagonists, often featuring high school students as the main characters. While there&#39;s nothing wrong with these titles, it&#39;s also nice to see someone more like yourself reflected on the screen. Still, there are plenty of options for the adult anime fan wanting a break from high school anime, looking for an emotional story, or simply wanting to laugh at the situations that every adult finds themselves in.
