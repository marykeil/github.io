## Literature Review

SHY was one of the most underrated anime of 2023, but fortunately, the series is set to receive a second season sometime in the future.




SHY is a superhero anime that was criminally underrated in 2023. The show had a unique take on the superhero genre that took clear cues from the magical girl genre and some very clever storytelling and editing, but due to a variety of factors, it was largely unnoticed during its run compared to other anime of the fall 2023 season and the year as a whole.




SHY&#39;s lack of attention during its run was very unfortunate, but there&#39;s a chance for the anime to redeem itself. Following the season finale, it was announced that 8bit&#39;s SHY would be continuing into a second season, although neither the release date nor the staff has been revealed at this time.


 

With the story that SHY season 2 is set to tell, it&#39;s bound to be just as good as season 1, if not better, and with any luck, it will help the series gain the recognition that it was so thoroughly robbed of throughout the entirety of its season 1 run.

                  10 Most Underrated Anime of 2023 That STILL Deserve More Attention   As with any year, there were plenty of anime in 2023 that were severely underrated, and these are the 10 that embody that more than any others.   





 SHY Season 2&#39;s Story Arc Explained 
Created by studio 8bit, based on the original manga by Bukimi Miki

          

With SHY set to receive a second season, it makes sense to discuss what season 2 will be about. Taking into account where season 1 left off and season 2&#39;s key visual, SHY season 2 seems to be focused on the conflict between Ai Tennoji and the Amarariruku member Utsuro Karakururi, the events of which cover volumes 5 to 9 of the manga. Said arc further enhances the fights and emotional character writing that had defined SHY from day one, and seeing all of that play out in animation will likely make the story, and the anime, even better as a result.

 Why SHY Season 1 Was So Underrated 
The anime series&#39; second season has the opportunity to bring the show into the mainstream
          

As exciting as it might be for SHY to receive a second season, it’s also important to discuss why season 1 fell so far under the radar. As good as SHY’s story might have been, SHY had to compete with anime that had far more attention attached to them, like Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End and The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You, and many episodes featured art and animation that were very noticeably lackluster. Because of that, as unfortunate as it is, it makes sense that SHY season 1 ended up receiving so little attention during its run.

As for whether SHY season 2 can fix these issues, it&#39;s still far too soon to tell. The story that SHY season 2 is set to tell takes the story to even greater heights, but if it has as heavy competition as season 1 did, and especially if it doesn’t have more consistent art and animation, then season 2 could also end up being as underrated as season 1. There&#39;s no way of knowing how SHY season 2 will play out, but with how charming of a series it is, it would be great if season 2 finally helped it catch on and gain a larger fanbase.
