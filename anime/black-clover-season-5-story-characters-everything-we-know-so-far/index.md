## Literature Review

Season 5 of Black Clover&#39;s anime will have a lot of great stuff to cover; here is everything currently known about the series&#39; anticipated return.




Anime fans are anxious for season 5 of Black Clover to continue, and after a hit movie and the manga hitting its stride with the series&#39; final arc, it may return sooner than expected. Author Yūki Tabata&#39;s story of Asta, a magicless but determined teenager set on becoming the Wizard King in a world filled with magic knights and fearsome devils, unfortunately, took a hiatus from both the manga and anime. Still, with the manga&#39;s return and the Black Clover: The Sword of the Wizard King film becoming a hit on Netflix, the anime series&#39; return seems more likely than ever before.




It&#39;s been since Spring 2021 that the Black Clover anime last aired with episode #170. While the episode featured a long-awaited reconciliation that&#39;ll help boost Asta to unseen levels of strength, it was a lackluster final episode for the epic Shōnen series. The manga has not only concluded the incredible Spade Kingdom Raid Arc the anime left off on, but has also made a good deal of progress in what&#39;s likely the final arc of Black Clover. Without spoiling things for anime watchers, they have much to look forward to in Season 5 of the Black Clover anime.

          

While the anime was releasing episodes weekly, it was beginning to get close to catching up with the manga. To avoid stretching episode pacing too thin or adding obnoxious filler arcs, Black Clover&#39;s anime paused production. However, now that the manga&#39;s final stretch has begun, season 5 of the anime has a lot of exciting ground to cover.





 The Latest News on Black Clover Season 5 
          

Season 5 of the Black Clover anime has not officially been announced to be in production. However, an announcement is likely now that the manga has released enough material for a new season to cover. The reason for such a delay could be that the studio that adapted the anime&#39;s previous seasons, Studio Pierrot, has been working on the stunning and celebrated Bleach: The Thousand Year Blood War adaption. With Pierrot&#39;s skills continuing to grow and the success of the Black Clover: The Sword of the Wizard King movie, the continuation of the Black Clover anime seems inevitable.

                  Black Clover Finally Makes Yuno Stronger Than Asta (With A Twist)   At the end of chapter #360, Black Clover convinced readers that Yuno is stronger than Asta, but a major twist made this victory short-lived.   






 The Story of Black Clover Season 5 
          

The existence of Devils and the influence of their terrible power has shaken Black Clover&#39;s world. Magical knights from multiple kingdoms have united to combat the Dark Triad, who plan on opening a gateway to the Underworld. If that were to happen, countless Devils would roam the lands, and its citizens would suffer greatly under a new world order. While the anime left off with a Devil&#39;s assault on the Heart Kingdom and Noelle&#39;s group, the next part of the story should see Asta gain an impressive new power in time for him and his allies to take on the Dark Triad.

                  Black Clover Proves How Great My Hero Academia&#39;s Original Ending Could Have Been   Considering My Hero Academia&#39;s original ending is the plot of Heroes Rising, similarities can be drawn to Black Clover&#39;s recent developments.   






 Black Clover Season 5 Release Date 
          

There is currently no release date for season 5 of the Black Clover anime. The start of production of the new season has also yet to be announced. However, several leaks on X have suggested that after the success of the Black Clover: The Sword of the Wizard King movie, a new season has been greenlit and will be released sometime in 2024. Still, those leaks have not been confirmed, and it&#39;s possible that the anime may wait until the final chapter of Black Clover is released to continue.

Once an official announcement, news, or a trailer about the return of the Black Clover anime is released, Screen Rant will magically appear to let fans know.
