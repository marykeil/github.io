 What Happened in Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #10? 
          




Spy x Family season 2, episode #10 follows the Forgers on the third day of the cruise trip as they finally reunite and spend the day together on a resort island. The Forgers enjoy a relaxing moment at last as they engage in fun activities including horseback riding, underwater diving, cave exploring, and sand castle building. Afterward, Loid is even forced to carry Anya and Yor back to the ship, as they have both passed out from exhaustion.

The Forgers return home the day after, and Loid visits the Handler to update her on the trip while Yor gives her co-workers souvenirs. Meanwhile, Anya goes back to school ready to boast about her vacation and hopefully impress Damian into inviting her over, only for her elite classmates to be utterly unimpressed. In a last-ditch attempt, Anya tries to lie about her trip to make it seem more exciting, but her classmates continue to make fun of her.

Dejected, Anya returns home where Yuri has come over to see Yor, and the three adults chastise her about lying. However, they silently defend the reason for their own lies in their heads, which Anya hilariously overhears using her psychic powers.
