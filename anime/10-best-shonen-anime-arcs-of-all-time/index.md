## Literature Review

Shonen is the most popular genre in anime, and many series have risen to the top thanks to unforgettable story arcs.




The most well-known anime such as Dragon Ball and Naruto are all shonen, and all those contain memorable story arcs that catapulted the series to fame.
Shonen is possibly the most popular genre in anime and was the gateway for many anime fans into the medium. Action-based series in every medium have always been popular, so it was no surprise that the action-packed shonen genre would become so loved. An arc is a story within an anime that is so significant that it warrants many episodes. It is very important to make an anime popular in that it engages viewers for many episodes and makes the anime more memorable, as opposed to a new story every episode.

 10  Karasuno&#39;s Toughest Match Yet 
Haikyuu!!, Karasuno vs Shiratorizawa - Season 3 Episodes 1-10


 







After many defeats and months of training, Hinata, Kageyama, and the Karasuno volleyball team finally went to the regional finals, but before them stood the undefeated Shiratorizawa. The game required everyone to bring out their best and they did. The team was holding on, and it seemed like they had a shot. The best moment in an emotional and intense match was when the lazy and laid-back Tsukishima let out a loud cheer after blocking the number 3 ace in the country, Ushiwaka. The team put everything into the game and came out stronger than ever. This was undoubtedly one of the best matches in sports anime.

 8  Kira And L&#39;s First Face Off 
Death Note, L vs Kira arc - Episodes 1-10
        

The first 10 episodes of Death Note were some of the best in the series. These 10 episodes were dedicated to Light&#39;s journey to becoming Kira, L hunting him down, and the iconic and chilling moment where Light revealed himself as Kira to Naomi before killing her. This arc was monumental in hooking viewers into what is probably one of the best thriller shonen anime of all time. The cat-and-mouse game between L and Kira was more entertaining than many fight-based shonen series out there and deviated from the generic action shonen that was increasingly popular at the time.

The highlight of the arc is obviously Gohan&#39;s rage moment and the defeat of Perfect Cell.

 1  An Elite Force Saves Humanity 
Hunter X Hunter, Chimera Ant arc - Episodes 76-136


 







It seemed like Hunter X Hunter would never replicate the heights of the Yorknew City arc but the Chimera Ant arc blew it out of the water. With the awakening of the Chimera King, Meruem, humanity seems to be headed to extinction. An elite group of assassins has the job of infiltrating a country run by the Chimera Ants and kill Meruem, getting past his incredibly strong bodyguards. This arc managed to convey hoe the heroes were fighting against impossible odds most of the time, but also took the time for some emotional development of the characters, even the villain Meruem. With Hunter X Hunter returning soon fans can only hope Togashi surpasses this peak.
