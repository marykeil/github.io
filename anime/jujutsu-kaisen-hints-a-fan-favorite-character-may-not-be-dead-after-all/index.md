## Literature Review

Chapter #236 of Jujutsu Kaisen broke many hearts but also inadvertently raised hope for the return of one of the series&#39; most loved characters.





Although the series is no stranger to killing off characters regardless of their popularity, Chapter #236 was especially gut-wrenching with several deceased characters making an appearance, reminding viewers of their tragic deaths. Gojo&#39;s unexpected demise felt all the more heartbreaking owing to his reunion with Geto, Nanami, Principal Yaga, and several others in what appears to be some form of the afterlife. That said, the absence of Nobara from the group that welcomes Gojo in the afterlife was glaringly obvious, and makes fans hope that she can still be alive.

 Gojo Did Not Meet Nobara in the Afterlife 
          

Nobara was not among those Gojo met in the afterlife in Chapter #236, suggesting that she may still be alive. Despite not being heard from or mentioned since the Shibuya incident, fans of the series have had their doubts about Nobara&#39;s death for the longest time given how ambiguous her final moments were. Moreover, the series never explicitly confirmed her death, fueling hopes that she may have received treatment from Shoko off-screen and was still recovering which would explain other characters&#39; silence on the matter as well as her absence during the Culling Game.

Though one might argue that Gojo met only the people truly dear to him and those who&#39;d had an impact on his life such as Toji, one cannot deny that Gojo did care for his students including Nobara, and saw himself during his youth in them. Actually, Gojo&#39;s love for his students is one of the defining traits of the character. Hence, there&#39;s no reason why she would not be present unless she isn&#39;t truly dead, unless author Gege Akutami is cruelly playing with fans&#39; hopes. Nonetheless, Nobara was a bright sorcerer with arguably just as much potential as Megumi and Yuji and might have grown into an exceptional fighter if given the opportunity.






 Nobara&#39;s Return Would Make Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Finale Even Better 
          

Given the general lack of well-executed female characters in shonen anime, Nobara was a breath of fresh air and has remained a favorite within the series despite attempts to replace her with Hana. Overall, Chapter #236 has raised many doubts with many being unsure of how the series will progress after such a monumental development. Regardless, Gojo&#39;s death has paved the way for the young sorcerers full of potential like Yuta, Yuji, and Nobara to take the spotlight as well as for the series&#39; original trio to reunite one last time albeit in a bittersweet battle before the grand finale of Jujutsu Kaisen.

Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Viz Media.
