## Literature Review

Although conceived on a whim, the Worst Generation in One Piece was full of vibrant personalities and powers. Here&#39;s where they all are now:





Many of these rookies have since been involved in several events that permanently altered the world of One Piece and shaped the story as we know it, living up to the notoriety that earned them the moniker. While most entered alliances in order to survive the brutal New World, some continued to move in the shadows, silently pulling strings in the background.

 6  Bege Went on an Adventure to Find Lola 
        

The macho Capone Bege and the Fire Tank Pirates played quite a pivotal role on Whole Cake Island in aiding the Straw Hats but little was revealed about what happened to them after. Luckily, Bege did receive a cover story of his own in the manga titled Gang Bege&#39;s Oh My Family, spanning multiple chapters beginning from Chapter #948.
The cover story follows the Fire Tank Pirates as they set out to find Lola at Chiffon&#39;s behest. Going off Lola&#39;s last known location the crew decide to head to Thriller Bark but are stopped by the increased security at the Red Line owing to the Reverie. Left with no choice, Bege and the crew head to Dressrosa where amidst the chaos and fighting Gotti mistakes Lola for Chiffon and saves her from the Marines until the real Chiffon shows up and clears the confusion. The two sisters reunite and also meet Pound who finally manages to prove he is in fact Chiffon and Lola&#39;s father. The cover story ends with the crew holding a celebration as cannonballs rain down on Gotti and Lola&#39;s wedding, the latter having proposed to him after he saved her.
Considering many of the Worst Generation have faced rather grim fates, it seems that Bege has been particularly fortunate in that regard. Though the anime has its hands full adapting more exciting events at the moment, Bege&#39;s wholesome family tale is certainly worth looking forward to and may be adapted with the rest of the Reverie Arc.





 5  Urouge Was Last Seen at Balloon Terminal 
        

Mad Monk Urouge is easily the most shrouded in mystery from the Worst Generation. Little is known about him other than that he hails from a sky island owing to his Birkan-like wings and strikingly similar appearance to Enel&#39;s High Priests. However, Urouge has been up to quite a lot since Sabaody. During the time skip, Urouge and his crew ventured into Tottoland where he defeated Charlotte Snack but was eventually defeated by Charlotte Cracker. Since then, Urouge was last seen near the sky island Kaido jumped off in Chapter #795.
Though the series hasn&#39;t said much about him since, given the trend of the Straw Hats encountering a member of the Worst Generation with every new story arc, perhaps it isn&#39;t long until Urouge and the Fallen Monk Pirates make an appearance.





 4  Drake, Hawkins, and Apoo Were Last Seen on Wano 
        

While Scratchmen Apoo was lucky enough to escape the chaos on Onigashima unscathed, X Drake and Basil Hawkins weren&#39;t as fortunate. Hawkins was defeated by Killer while Drake was injured while fighting against the CP0 agents at Onigashima. The two were last seen in Chapter #1052 gravely injured inside the castle, with Hawkins apparently dying form his wounds. Though there is a possibility that Drake might have survived, Chapter #1061 revealed that the Marines have not been able to contact him since leaving his fate undecided.
As for Hawkins, though his death has yet to be confirmed, it is quite unlikely that he survived from his last conversation with Drake where he revealed he had predicted his own death following the events at Onigashima. Meanwhile, Apoo was last seen in Chapter #1053 at Udon where he handed Kid a newspaper with the new bounty posters just a chapter prior. Though Apoo hasn&#39;t made an appearance since, considering his strong sense of self-preservation he likely escaped Wano and is alive and well.





 3  Law, Kid, and Killer Were Defeated by Emperors 
        

While Law and Kid were fortunate enough to survive after facing off against an Emperor once, it seems their luck ran out the second time around. After Law, Kid, and Killer left Wano, they were each unfortunately annihilated. Law had the misfortune of running into an ambush set up by Blackbeard while Kid was humiliated by Shanks who taught him a rather swift lesson at Elbaf.
Judging by the damage Kid&#39;s crew and ship sustained, it seems unlikely that either Kid or Killer survived Shanks&#39; Divine Departure. At best, the two may be fatally wounded. As for the Heart Pirates, fortunately, there seems to be some hope for their captain as Bepo manages to save Law from a tragic fate at the hands of the Blackbeard Pirates in Chapter #1081.





 2  Luffy, Zoro, and Bonney Have Been Cornered on Egghead 
        

Though the particulars of Luffy and Zoro&#39;s adventures after entering the New World are common knowledge, Bonney has made only a handful of appearances in the series so far up until Egghead. However, that isn&#39;t to say that she hasn&#39;t been up to much since entering the New World. Not only was she captured by the Blackbeard Pirates and Akainu but also managed to escape from the Marines, infiltrate Pangea Castle by posing as a noble, and escape from the Holy Land once again by stowing away on a ship.
From there, Bonney headed to Egghead Island looking for answers from Vegapunk about her father Kuma, where she is at present. Admittedly, things do not seem to be going well at Egghead with the Marines having sent a large portion of their might including Admiral Kizaru, nine Vice Admirals, and 100 ships to surround the island, all led by one of the Five Elders. Bonney also clearly has a big role to play in all these, considering how much Vegapunk seems to care about her.

 1  Blackbeard May Be Headed To Egghead 
        

Chaotic as the situation on Egghead may be at present, things may escalate even further if Blackbeard is heading to the futuristic island as well. Considering Blackbeard was last seen at Winner Island which is not quite far from Egghead, the ship seen heading to Egghead in Chapter #1079 may truly have Blackbeard aboard along with Burgess, Van Augur, Doc Q, and even Catarina Devon and Laffitte, who were noticeable missing from Fullalead. Unlikely as it seems, the ship seen approaching Egghead did have the Blackbeard Pirates&#39; Jolly Roger and shares a striking resemblance to the one seen in Chapter #1064 during the battle against the Heart Pirates.
In all, the Worst Generation has truly lived up to its name and reputation, and although recent events have cleared many players off the board, the finale might yet see several of them return for the epic, final war for the One Piece. After all, if there&#39;s one thing One Piece has taught fans over the years it is that no character is ever truly dead unless explicitly stated, so maybe there is still hope for several of the Worst Generation members.
