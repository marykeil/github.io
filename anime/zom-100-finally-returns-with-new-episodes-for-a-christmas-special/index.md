                  Massive Crunchyroll Hit Has One Big Problem, &amp; Its Opening Proves It   Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead has had notable production issues almost from day one, and nothing showcases that better than its opening theme.   





 Zom 100 Comes Back To End Season 1 With A Christmas Special 
          

Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead, based on the manga by Haro Aso and Kotaro Takata, was the first anime produced by BUG FILM. While the animation and design seemed to be on point, there were numerous production issues behind the scenes that resulted in almost weekly delays. Ultimately, the studio ran out of time slots to air the remaining three episodes, leading to an indefinite hiatus. However, after a two-month break to address these issues, the studio is now confident in releasing the remaining episodes on the biggest holiday of the year.

One of the reasons why Zom 100 became an instant hit was due to its unique premise. While a zombie outbreak would typically be a terrible event, the main character Akira Tendo is thrilled by the prospect of not having to return to work for his exploitative company. The anime was an ideal fit for the studio, which had previously experienced a grueling workload under the studio responsible for PokÃ©mon before branching out on its own. This theme made the unfortunate delays behind the anime, likely caused by an overworked staff, a little sarcastic and even sadder, especially for fans of the show.




          

The summer of 2023 was made memorable by the release of a new anime that took the industry by storm. This anime not only provided great entertainment but also highlighted the terrible working conditions faced by Japanese anime studios. Although it did not meet everyone&#39;s expectations, the creators can redeem themselves by providing a fitting conclusion to the first season of Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead when the final three episodes air on Christmas Day.
