## Literature Review

An episode of Pokémon the Series: XY sees Ash enter an alternate mirror world where Team Rocket are heroes instead of villains.




Team Rocket is the long-running antagonist of Pokémon, but one episode proved that, in an alternate world, they can actually be the greatest heroes. With their iconic uniforms and memorable catchphrases, the trio seeks to capture powerful Pokémon and take over the world, but their efforts always end in failure. While they are known for their schemes against Ash and his friends, there are several occasions where they act as heroes.




Team Rocket consists of Jessie, James, and Meowth, although Jessie&#39;s Wobbuffet sometimes comes out of its Pokéball and joins them. They are obsessed with capturing Ash&#39;s Pikachu and follow him across the different regions in the series. The trio&#39;s incompetency is pointed out by many other characters and often leads them into comical situations. Despite their status as antagonists, they are shown to have some affection for Ash and his friends, and will sometimes team up with them to fight a common enemy. They even display instances of humanity, such as when they save Ash from a fall in Spell of the Unown: Entei. 


 Team Rocket&#39;s Mirror World Counterparts Are Actual Heroes 
Pokémon the Series: XY, episode 37, &#34;The Cave of Mirrors&#34;
          

                  Only One of Pokémon&#39;s Team Rocket Duos Got the Happy End Jessie &amp; James Deserved   Pokémon&#39;s second most popular Team Rocket duo got to retire in peace, a fate which stands at odds with that of the much more popular Jessie and James.   




In Pokémon the Series: XY, episode 37, &#34;The Cave of Mirrors&#34;, the group enters a cave with reflective walls. As Ash approaches a light, he sees his reflection pull Pikachu into the rock and follows the two of them inside. He finds himself in an unfamiliar forest, surrounded by the mirror versions of his companions, whose personalities are the exact opposite of his world&#39;s counterparts. Ash learns that Serena is arrogant, Clemont uses magic, and Bonnie is a refined lady. In a strange twist, the Team Rocket of the mirror world is known as &#34;The Heroes of Justice.&#34;

While Ash doesn&#39;t meet the alternate Team Rocket, he learns from his friends that they are famous for always fighting against villains in the Mirror World. However, the original trio of antagonists ends up meeting their doppelgängers, who once again have opposite personalities, and preach goodness in their motto instead of evil. Their voices are hilariously deeper, and the &#34;R&#34; on their uniform is mirrored. The episode ends as the original Team Rocket looks upon the scene with shock.




          

While the anime plays it off as a joke, the Mirror World shows what Team Rocket could have been if their difficult childhoods hadn&#39;t directed them toward evil. Jessie and James&#39; backstories are surprisingly deep, and these influenced their choices later in life. They are shown to be notorious thieves, but they are hardly the biggest criminals in the Pokémon World and have even stepped up to fight greater threats. In an episode of Pokémon Chronicles called &#34;We&#39;re No Angels!&#34;, the group is mistaken for heroes by the residents of a farming village and considers turning to the good side.

While they will always be remembered for their roles as villains, Team Rocket has proven on many occasions that they are a lot more nuanced than that. The Mirror World episode in Pokémon the Series: XY offers a glimpse into what Team Rocket&#39;s lives could have been, proving that they could have been among the greatest heroes in the Pokémon world.
