## Literature Review

V for Vendetta and the cyberpunk genre rose at the same time, and now artist BossLogic deftly mixes the two together. 




V, from V for Vendetta, gets a cyberpunk redesign in an awesome new piece of fan art. V for Vendetta is widely regarded by fans and critics as one of the best comic books of all time, and a watershed moment in the careers of Alan Moore and David Lloyd. V, the series’ protagonist, is one of the most memorable characters in comic history, and now acclaimed artist BossLogic gives him an amazing cyberpunk reworking.




BossLogic unveiled the piece in an Instagram post. Prefacing the post by saying “write it down and remember that we never gave in,” BossLogic gives fans a truly unique look at this pop culture icon. Here, V is remade as a cyborg, almost more machine than human. He is wearing his trademark Guy Fawkes mask, only now has it been incorporated into his helmet.


 

V is sniffing a rose while other petals flutter around him.


 V for Vendetta Was a Landmark Comic In the 1980s 
          

V for Vendetta, by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, is hailed far and wide as a masterpiece of the medium. First published in Warrior magazine in the early to mid 1980s and finished later in the decade at DC Comics, V for Vendetta was a bleak and uncompromising vision of the future, one where Britain had descended into a fascist police state. V, an anarchist, sought to burn it all down. Coming at the time of Swamp Thing and Watchmen, V for Vendetta firmly established Alan Moore as a force to be reckoned with. The comic was adapted into a live action movie in 2005, introducing V to a mass audience.




While V for Vendetta was being published, a new genre within science fiction was being born: cyberpunk. Influenced by the New Wave of science fiction of the 1960s, cyberpunk was dirty and raw, showing worlds that were simultaneously high-tech and decadent. Cyberpunk authors such as William Gibson and Bruce Sterling gave readers bleak visions of the future where scientific progress did little to stop societal collapse. This juxtaposition made cyberpunk all the rage in the 1980s, and its influence is still being felt today.

                  Alan Moore Confirms V for Vendetta Almost Had a Very Different Name   Fans may be familiar with the visage of Alan Moore&#39;s classic character from V for Vendetta, but few may be aware of the names he nearly went by.   



 CyberPunk and V for Vendetta Are Made for Each Other 
          




And now BossLogic has brought cyberpunk to V for Vendetta, and it is the perfect pairing. Both V for Vendetta and cyberpunk show fans the disastrous consequences of losing empathy and basic humanity, and replacing them with greed and violence. The 1980s saw a great deal of deregulation of corporations and business, and the propagation of a “greed is good” mentality. Cyberpunk novels rail against this, just as V for Vendetta is a take-down of right wing authoritarianism. BossLogic sees the similarities between the two, and melds them perfectly in this new piece of fan art.
