  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The best shonen anime power systems enhance the series by introducing new developments and intensifying the narrative.
Certain series, like
Naruto
, have a well-structured power system from the beginning, while others like
Hunter X Hunter
and
JoJo
need to introduce new systems later on.
The introduction of new power systems not only changes the understanding of the story and characters but also opens up new paths of growth and possibilities.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The best shonen power systems introduce part-way through an anime will always add fresh perspectives and create new paths to strength.</p>
<p>The best shonen anime power systems will greatly improve their series when introduced, transforming any current landscape or status quo into a further contextualized universe. Many shonen anime start with an open-ended or pilot power system to test the waters. However, as a series continues, fans will demand more intensity and new developments, leading to a need for expansion that goes further than simply stating that new enemies have become stronger.
On the other hand, there are anime like Naruto that seemingly have a perfect grasp of their power systems from the get-go, as the concept is structured in a way that any future innovations can be smoothly integrated into the Chakra system. However, there are series that find themselves absolutely needing new power systems at one point or another, and the best systems that are introduced part-way through a series will not only change the understanding of the narrative and characters, but it will open up new paths of growth and infinite possibilities.</p>

Isekai as a genre often highlights just how over-the-top powerful its protagonists can be. In some series, this is cranked up to eleven.</p>
<p>10 Egyptian Magic Is Revealed as Duel Monsters’ Origin
Yu-Gi-Oh! - Studio Gallop</p>
<p>The original Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, which was released in 2000, has a power system based on a card game that lately gave birth to one of the most popular trading card games. The classic shonen anime follows a young Mutou Yugi, who is the owner of a strange puzzle that houses a mysterious soul. While the earliest part of the series saw Yugi compete in different high-stakes games, soon he embarks on a journey of playing Duel Monsters, a game involving battling monsters within a mix of strategy that also includes spell and trap cards.
Although Duel Monsters starts as a typical tabletop card game, it gradually injects itself into the world&rsquo;s reality, first starting with holographic systems created by Pegasus and Kaiba Seto. Later, the game introduces the background of the card game, its origins rooted in Ancient Egypt and its mythology and magic. This introduction perfectly contextualizes the motivation of the characters and the narrative of the show, serving as an interim power system of sorts where those with the deepest understanding of Egyptian history will reign supreme.

<p>9 The Black Trigger Opens Up The Trion Power System
World Trigger - Toei Animation</p>
<p>First released in 2014, World Trigger is an amazing shonen sci-fi adaptation of the manga of the same name by Ashihara Daisuke. The premise of the series is that, in a time a little past the modern-day, gates have opened up around the world, connected with various alien landscapes and universes. These aliens are labeled as neighbors, and given an overall villainous public image.
In the world of World Trigger, the power system is structured around an energy system called Trion, which powers the weapons, called triggers, that soldiers use to combat invading neighbors. However, with the introduction of one of the series&rsquo; main characters, Kuga Yuma&rsquo;s powers, the Black Trigger is brought to the forefront. Serving sort of as a sub-system within the greater Trion System, the Black Trigger is an ultimate weapon that requires the ultimate sacrifice for its creation, but creates unstoppable power of infinite varieties.

<p>8 Spiral Power Adds New Perspective To the Universe
Gurren Lagann - Studio Gainax</p>
<p>Released in 2007, Gurren Lagann is one of the most popular and successful original anime series, as it was directed by the masterful Imaishi Hiroyuki. The story follows a young, timid boy named Simon, as he is spurred on by his friend Kamina to embark on a journey to the surface world. In the world of Gurren Lagann, humans adhere to a status quo of being regulated to subterranean life, and Kamina, who is tired of the tunnels, decides to drag Simon along for some exploration.
The narrative of the series can essentially be segmented into two distinct parts: the first documents Simon and Team Gurren&rsquo;s iconic rise to power through mechs and reclaiming of the surface, and the second concludes with an epic intergalactic war with the Anti-Spirals, who turn out to be the real enemies of humans. Preceding the introduction of the Anti-Spirals, the power system of Spiral power had to first be inaugurated. Spiral power essentially represents humanity&rsquo;s power, leading Gurren Lagann to open up its creative mind to the wonders of the universe.

<p>7 Demon Energy Contextualizes The Final Tournament Arc
Yu Yu Hakusho - Studio Pierrot</p>
<p>Yu Yu Hakusho is a classic shonen anime series released in 1992 that has truly stood the test of time, entering it into the conversation of possibly the greatest shonen series in existence. The story follows a young delinquent named Urameshi Yuusuke, who uncharacteristically dies in the very first episode. However, the series takes a wonderful turn as Yuusuke&rsquo;s death opens up a whole new world of spirits, demons, and apparitions, which he begins to explore after an arduously touching but comedic path to resurrection.
The power system used in Yu Yu Hakusho is quite simple, and referred to as Energy, starting with the Spirit Energy that is exclusive to humans. As the series progresses through one riveting tournament arc after the next, series creator Yoshihiro Togashi introduces much-needed power levels, and later demon energy, as Yuusuke enters the demon world to fight for the throne. Such a new power also calls for new rankings, as the demons adopt a letter system that ranks up to S. Such an addition prepares for the ultimate tournament arc of the series in exciting fashion.

<p>6 Titan Shifters Adds a Whole New Fear Factor
Attack on Titan - Wit Studio, Studio MAPPA</p>
<p>One of the most popular shonen anime of the recent decade, released in 2013, Attack on Titan single-handedly raised the curtains on the new wave of dystopian and post-disaster genres. Following a young boy named Eren, the series is a statement of perseverance and revenge in a broken world that is overrun by humanoid giant monsters that feast on humans. Eren&rsquo;s mother was eaten by such a monster, which are called titans, and Eren vows to enter the Survey Corps and rid the world of the titan’s plight.
However, by possibly the biggest twist in anime history, it turns out that Eren has the power of the titans himself, and he is able to transform into a cognizant giant fighting machine. Thus begins the era of the titan shifters, which can arguably fit the mold of a shonen power system. The plot of Attack on Titan becomes infinitely more complex and interesting, as the idea of titans has evolved from mindless killing machines to a collective force with humans who can transform into titans lurking among their ranks.

<p>5 The Bankai Made The Shinigami System Legendary
Bleach - Studio Pierrot</p>
<p>One of the Big Three of shonen anime, Bleach took the world by storm when it originally aired in 2004, crafting a fresh perspective on action shonen with its slightly darker undertones. The franchise took an even bigger leap forward with the recent release of Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War. The overall story follows Kurosaki Ichigo, a high school student who is suddenly pulled into the spirit world turmoil involving soul reapers, soul society, and the vicious Hollows that serve as the series&rsquo; main antagonists.
Overall, Bleach’s power system is based on Spiritual Power, but branches off into many fields, as the Bleach universe houses different species and races that use different energies, such as Shinigami, Hollows, and Quicies. However, the greatest mid-series power system introduction that altered the entire anime landscape is a subsection of the Shinigami’s Zanpakuto powers called the Bankai. This final release of Shinigami powers completely opened up the floor in terms of creative freedom, and caused a still-persistent wave of anime fans shouting &ldquo;Bankai!&rdquo; along with their favorite characters.

<p>4 Nen Is One Of The Most Complex Power Systems Ever Seen
Hunter x Hunter - Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Released in 2011, the remake of Hunter x Hunter quenched the thirst of many anime fans who were disappointed with the end of the 1999 series. The story follows a young boy named Gon who sets out to become a hunter, the focus profession of the Hunter x Hunter narrative. The first arc of the series that covered the hunter exam introduced a large cast of characters, all with their unique abilities, but without an overall power system that defined the series.
Clearly, Yoshihiro Togashi, the author of Hunter x Hunter, quickly changed his mind and introduced the complex power system known as Nen, which served both as an expansion of the universe and an explanation for unexplained powers that were introduced earlier. Nen has rightfully become one of the most celebrated power systems in manga and anime, due to its sheer complexity and layered rules, which allows every Hunter x Hunter battle to become a mental more than physical challenge.

<p>3 The Saiyan Power System Redefined the Franchise
Dragon Ball Z - Toei Animation</p>
<p>The flagbearer of international anime, and a homestead name of the shonen demographic, Dragon Ball has moved millions of hearts with its retelling of the mystical Sun Wukong since 1986. After the original Dragon Ball series ended in 1989, Toei Animation followed up with Dragon Ball Z, which really started the rise of one of the biggest franchises in anime history.
The power system in Dragon Ball Z is centered around Ki, or energy. Despite the straightforward power structure, there is no lack of creative and diverse battles. However, compared to Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z takes a giant step forward with the idea of the Saiyan race and, subsequently, the Super Saiyan. This iconic transformation that turns its user blond can serve as a new power system introduction when considering the flow of the franchise as a whole, as it essentially creates a whole new story path that has transformed anime culture forever.

From the creative mind of Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is a mega multimedia franchise that spans back to the 1980s. Dragon Ball expanded quickly, starting as a serialized manga for Weekly Shonen Jump in Japan. It made its way overseas via manga and an anime adaptation that is enjoyed worldwide. Dragon Ball was the initial starting animated series that followed the adventures of the young Son Goku as he sought after the Dragon Balls. These mystical orbs would grant the wish of any who gathered them together. Then, the series would branch off into the immensely popular Dragon Ball Z, which followed Goku as an adult and featured high-intensity battles and Goku&rsquo;s never-ending search to be the strongest. The series has also enjoyed several popular video game adaptations and continues to release several new animated series and theatrical films up to the recent popular Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.</p>

<p>2 Stands Saved the Series In Iconic Fashion
Jojo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventures - David Production</p>
<p>JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure is a wacky shonen anime that was first released in 2012, following the incredible adventures of the Joestar family through generations, centuries, and even different dimensions. JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure is not only unique in the way that it structures its seasons into independent but connected parts, it also provides something new with every narrative step forward it takes.
As the story of the Joestar family unfolds, with each new generation embarking on their own adventure, the JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure universe also begins to transform. The beginning parts of JJBA revolve around a simple power system called Hamon, or Ripple, a form of vital energy applied to martial arts. However, by part 3, Stardust Crusaders, Stands are introduced, bringing whole new dimensions and perspective to the series. Stands are essentially the physical manifestations of a character&rsquo;s psyche, and each has a unique power, which allowed series creator Hiroiko Araki to go wild with his imagination, making each fight and character in the franchise different.

<p>1 Haki Opens Up the New World
One Piece - Toei Animation</p>
<p>The classic shonen pirate story that any anime fan would have heard of, One Piece is a series that has been ongoing for over two decades since 1999. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, a pirate who aspires to become the Pirate King, as he collects a group of crewmates that are just as eccentric as him. One Piece has also always been iconic for its power system, namely the Devil Fruit, a mysterious item that, when eaten, grants powerful abilities ranging from changing the body’s properties to rubber, to bestowing the ability to turn into smoke.
However, as the series progresses deeper into an expanding universe of stronger and stronger characters, a new power system is desperately needed, and Oda Eiichiro, the series&rsquo; mangaka, chooses the perfect time to reveal Haki, a system independent of Devil Fruits but just as strong. Haki not only introduces a new dimension of power, but it explains the strength of any mysterious characters who previously appeared with abilities beyond the One Piece universe’s understanding at the time.
