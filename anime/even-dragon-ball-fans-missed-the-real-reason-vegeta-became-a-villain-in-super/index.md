## Literature Review

Vegeta became a villain again in Dragon Ball Super, but this actually has a great explanation and it&#39;s connected to Destruction and Ultra Ego.





Vegeta turns on Goku in chapter #76 of Dragon Ball Super, going off to fight Granloah on his own, but what Vegeta mutters to himself when the Cerealean is about to kill him demonstrates that Beerus led him to believe that he needed to change as a person to effectively wield the Power of Destruction (Hakai). In chapter #69 of Dragon Ball Super, Beerus tells Vegeta that his own power as a God of Destruction is unbounded because he only thinks about destruction, and that if Vegeta wanted to wield Destruction, he would have to destroy any stray thoughts he had.





 Vegeta&#39;s Return To Villainy In Dragon Ball Super Was All An Act 
          

At the time, Beerus was chiding Vegeta for spending too much time feeling responsible for the sins of the Saiyan race. However, Vegeta clearly interpreted Beerus&#39; words as a need to return to his old, ruthless ways. During the fight against Granloah, Vegeta forces his opponent to destroy the ruins of his list civilization, and then even attacks Goku, telling him he would rather die than team up with him again. This seemed a completely random turn to fans, but it all makes sense because Vegeta was actually trying to master his new power, which came to fruition with his Ultra Ego transformation.

However, as proved by his later apology to Beerus, Vegeta was only fighting dirty against Granolah and said those horrible things to Goku because he was trying to wield Destruction in the most effective way, as Beerus told him to. This would explain why Vegeta is able to drop acting like he once did almost too quickly, as though nothing even happened. Surely enough, soon after that Vegeta teams up with Goku again, and the two Saiyans witness together the memories of Bardock, creating an even stronger bond over the legacy of their species.






 Vegeta&#39;s Redemption Is Genuine And He Will Remain A Good Guy 
          

So even though many fans may have felt that Dragon Ball Super promised to make Vegeta a villain again and then failed to deliver, Beerus&#39; comments to Vegeta about how he could master Destruction and then Vegeta&#39;s admission about how he failed to revert to how he once was all explain everything perfectly. Vegeta&#39;s return to villainy failed because he was trying to be someone he no longer was, and Dragon Ball Super was just giving fans one last glimpse of this version of the Saiyan Prince before shutting the door on that chapter of his life for good.
