Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #407 of My Hero Academia. 




As the series quickly approaches its climax, My Hero Academia has taken fans by storm yet again with a massive reveal in the ninth hour that changes the series&#39; lore forever. The latest chapter delves into All for One&#39;s origins and recontextualizes facts established by the series as early as the very first chapter.

Chapter #407 of My Hero Academia reveals All For One&#39;s mother possessed the earliest form of a quirk in the form of mysterious hardened growths while pregnant with All For One and Yoichi, which was then stolen by All For One once she gave birth.

          

Most importantly, these events take place prior to the birth of the luminescent baby, suggesting All For One, Yoichi, and their mother may have been the first quirk users. The chapter also finally reveals the origins of the mysterious gene responsible for the manifestation of quirks, which may lead to a paradigm shift in the understanding of quirks and their origins.




                  My Hero Academia&#39;s Four Types of Quirks Explained   Not all superpowers are created equal. In My Hero Academia, quirks come in four flavors, and which one you end up with can impact life significantly.   


 My Hero Academia Reveals the Truth About the Luminescent Baby 
          

Chapter #407 reveals All For One and Yoichi were born an entire year before the infamous luminescent baby who the series earlier established as the first quirk user. Rather, the luminescent baby was in fact only the first documented case. Moreover, the chapter also finally reveals the connection between All For One and the luminescent baby. While fans have long theorized that All For One might have actually been the luminescent baby, Chapter #407 suggests a slightly different story. While All For One certainly isn&#39;t the luminescent baby, he does end up stealing the quirk from him about three years later, oddly fulfilling the theory albeit in a roundabout way.




All For One&#39;s backstory also gives readers a better look into the state of society at the time as well as the events leading up to the various conflicts that followed with the appearance of quirks, particularly due to the early research conducted on them that revealed a surprising and terrifying truth.

                  10 Strangest My Hero Academia Quirks   Quirks in My Hero Academia are superpower-like abilities that have no limitations. Due to this variety, there are many Quirks that stand out.   



 All For One and Yoichi May Not Be Entirely Human 
          

Chapter #407 of My Hero Academia reveals that quirks users are a new subspecies of humanity entirely, with a unique genetic makeup. Though the series has yet to explain what exactly might have led to this disease or mutation, one can assume the specifics of All For One and Yoichi&#39;s conception and their parentage might provide some answers.




Though slim, there is also the possibility that this mutation arose from contact with an otherworldly species or alien life, as it seems odd that All For One&#39;s mother would develop such a drastic genetic mutation out of the blue without a catalyst. This could also explain why All For One and Yoichi&#39;s quirks are among the most powerful quirks in My Hero Academia as well as the unique characteristics of One For All and All For One as compared to regular quirks at the time.

          

While the idea of aliens crossing paths with the story of My Hero Academia seems incredibly far-fetched, it would certainly add an interesting level of complexity to the lore and also make for quite an unexpected twist. Most notably, the belief about quirk users being quite literally a different species also finally explains the source of prejudice against quirk users as well as the various conflicts that initially arose owing to their dehumanization. A revelation so frightening coupled with the chaos of manifesting abilities would have certainly divided society and set the stage for All For One to rise to prominence as he did.




Nonetheless, the latest chapter has single-handedly redefined key aspects of the series&#39; lore while also expanding on it in surprising yet meaningful ways. Although the chapter has left fans teeming with questions, the series will certainly provide all the answers in due time. All the same, it seems that My Hero Academia may yet have plenty of similar surprises in store as it nears its finale.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
