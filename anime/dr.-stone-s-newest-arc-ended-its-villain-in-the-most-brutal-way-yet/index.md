# Dr. Stone s Newest Arc Ended Its Villain in the Most Brutal Way Yet


## SUMMARY 



  Senku defeats Ibara in a brutal battle over the Medusa artifact in the Dr. Stone: New World finale, turning him to stone as the villain did to others on the island.   Despite being petrified, Ibara may still be conscious due to his intelligence and cunning, making his fate quite cruel.   Ibara&#39;s future looks bleak as his crimes and dangerous nature make it unlikely for him to be revived anytime soon, potentially remaining trapped for hundreds or thousands of years.

## Literature Review

The Dr. Stone: New World anime recently concluded, and it featured one of the most brutal endings for a villain in the series so far.




The latest season of Dr. Stone has concluded, with Senku bringing one of the most brutal endings to a character arc in the story so far. Dr. Stone: New World ends with a battle over the Medusa - a mysterious, alien-like artifact with the power to turn people to stone. Its power petrifies hundreds of islanders, with only Senku and the villainous Ibara remaining to fight for control over it.




While a new Dr. Stone spinoff manga focused on time travel has recently begun serialization, the anime is still behind, having just concluded its third season, Dr. Stone: New World. In the dramatic finale, following a battle of wits between Senku and Ibara for the possession of the Medusa, Senku comes out on top when Ibara ultimately falls victim to the device, being turned to stone like he had done to many others on the island.

          

While the Kingdom of Science freed the islanders from this petrification, they consciously decided not to revive Ibara, despite having the means to do so. Being turned to stone is a state similar to death for most people, and those affected have no memory of their time as statues when they&#39;re eventually released. However, Ibara is likely to be one of the rare exceptions.




                  Dr. Stone Characters, Ranked From Worst To Best By Character Arc   Dr. Stone is a unique shonen anime that utilizes science in an interesting way. Here are the main characters ranked by their arcs.   


 Despite Being Petrified, Ibara Might Still be Fully Conscious 
          

When Senku breaks free of his stone prison at the beginning of the series, he claims to have stayed conscious for the entire duration - almost 3720 years - by counting the seconds while he was trapped. This was also the case for Taiju, who focused on things like his love for Yuzuriha, and worrying about whether she was still alive, to avoid losing his awareness. While there is no strict rule for who can and cannot avoid losing consciousness while turned to stone, Ibara is a significant candidate for being able to do it due to his similarities to Senku and Taiju.




While the majority of main characters in Dr. Stone have claimed that they were unaware of their thoughts or surroundings while petrified, Ibara proved during the Treasure Island arc that his cunning and ruthlessness come from an intelligence that can rival even the biggest thinkers in the Kingdom of Science. He outsmarted Senku on numerous occasions, and he would have bested the scientist in their final confrontation if the fight had truly been one-on-one. That, paired with a tenacity that could rival even Taiju, makes it very likely that this serial plotter would keep his mind sharp while trapped in stone.



 Ibara&#39;s Fate Highlights Senku&#39;s Ruthless Side 
          

Unfortunately for Ibara, his numerous crimes against the islanders, as well as how dangerous he is as one of the most intelligent characters in Dr. Stone, make it unlikely that he&#39;ll be revived with any urgency. With limits to how quickly Revival Fluid can be produced, and with priority going to the millions of people still petrified, Ibara may not be revived for hundreds if not thousands of years. Without being kept near nitric acid, the substance that caused Senku to eventually revive, Ibara may remain trapped for a period longer than Senku if the new world keeps him that way - and he may remain conscious for the entire duration.




The fate of this character is highly unusual, as villains in Dr. Stone tend to be quickly redeemed and switch to the heroes&#39; side, as it happened with Tsukasa earlier in the series. Still, Ibara&#39;s fate highlights a ruthless side of Senku&#39;s personality and it proves that even in a light-hearted story such as Dr. Stone, some villains are simply beyond redemption.

Dr. Stone: New World is available to stream on Crunchyroll.
