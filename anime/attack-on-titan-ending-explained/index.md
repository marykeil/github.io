## Literature Review

After running for a decade, Attack on Titan&#39;s anime finally comes to an end, and here&#39;s everything about the ending explained in full detail.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Part 2After 10 years and going through two different anime studios, Attack on Titan’s anime has finally come to a close. The series finale, for better or worse, was largely the same as the extended ending to the manga with a few small changes, so people who read the manga and people who only watched the anime will likely have similar reactions to its conclusion.




Having unlocked the full power of the Founding Titan, Eren started the Rumbling and sent his Titans around the world to kill everyone outside of Paradis Island. Despite knowing that the Rumbling is the only way to ensure the safety of their home and that they don’t have any better ideas, Armin, Mikasa, Levi, and the rest of Eren’s former allies refuse to accept genocide as a solution, and they team up with some of the Marleyan forces to stop Eren.

          

Many more lives were lost in their journey, most notably Hange, but they still made it to Eren with the full intent of stopping him and saving the world.

                  Attack On Titan&#39;s New Chapter Could Fix The Series&#39; Controversial Ending   In 2024, Attack on Titan will be receiving a new story for the first time in three years, and it&#39;s a perfect chance to fix its controversial ending.   





 How The Final Battle Against Eren Starts In Attack On Titan 

 

In part 1 of Attack on Titan’s finale, “The Battle of Heaven and Earth”, Armin planned to blow up Eren’s Titan form with his transformation, but before he could activate it, an okapi-like Titan swallowed him whole, revealing that Eren had summoned countless Titan Shifters of the past to fight them. This even included more familiar Titan Shifters like Bertholdt, Galliard, and Ymir, and their combined power stopped Pieck from blowing up Eren’s neck, generally overwhelming the Global Alliance. It looked as if everyone was about to die, but at the last moment, they were saved by Annie and Gabi flying in atop Falco in his new Titan form.

With the situation more desperate than ever, the Global Alliance reluctantly accepted that they had to kill Eren, so they split into two teams: one to blow up Eren’s neck, and the other to save Armin. Neither team has any more luck fighting off the ancient Titan Shifters, however. Armin bemoans his uselessness as he watches his friends risk their lives to no avail. As Armin does so, he starts to question how he’s able to think in the first place, and that leads to Armin realizing that he’s been transported to the Paths dimension, upon which he meets Zeke building a sand castle.






 Armin Proves That Compassion Was The Best Solution In Attack On Titan 
          

In part 2 of Attack on Titan’s finale, “A Long Dream”, Armin tried to convince Zeke to help him stop Eren, but Zeke didn’t see the point as he no longer saw the point in life. Armin, however, made Zeke realize that life was all about the small, meaningless things that bring people joy, and that made Zeke think about how happy he would have been if he&#39;d just kept playing baseball with Ksaver. That realization caused the spirits of the deceased Titan Shifters who appeared in the series to manifest, and Armin and Zeke gave them the strength to resist Eren’s power and fight back against him.

With the old Titan Shifters on their side, the Global Alliance regained momentum and fought back against Eren. Mikasa freed Armin from the okapi-like Titan, and Zeke allowed himself to be killed by Levi, thus forcing Eren’s Titans to stop the Rumbling. Jean took advantage of that opening to detonate the bomb around Eren’s neck, which forced out the worm-like creature that first bonded with Ymir Fritz, and Armin attempted to destroy the worm-like creature and Eren with the explosion from his transformation. With Eren and the worm-like creature dead, it appeared that the threat of the Rumbling was finally over.

In a final gambit to continue the Rumbling, Eren reemerges with a new Titan form to fight Armin and the worm-like creature releases a gas that turns all the surrounding Eldians, save for Mikasa, Levi, and the Titan Shifters, into an army of Titans to help it reconnect with Eren. As Mikasa struggles with everything, she has a vision of a world where she and Eren ran away and lived together in peace as the world went to war. Said vision strengthened Mikasa’s resolve, and Mikasa decapitated Eren from inside his Titan form and said goodbye to him with a final kiss.






 Eren’s Death &amp; True Plan In Attack On Titan Explained 
         

In the final part of Attack on Titan’s finale, “Toward the Tree on That Hill”, Eren and Armin met in the Paths dimension where Eren revealed that he wanted Armin and everyone to become heroes for defeating him and earn enough respect to protect Paradis Island. He also revealed that everything was predetermined and designed to free Ymir Fritz from her love for King Fritz, something that Mikasa was the key to accomplishing. Armin also berated Eren for playing with Mikasa’s feelings, and Eren admitted to not wanting to die, but also said it was too late, especially with how the Rumbling had killed 80% of humanity outside the island.

Armin was horrified by all of that, and he was especially taken aback by Eren’s assertion that this was the only path to take after trying out countless different scenarios. Armin called out Eren’s plan for how it would only make things worse, and Eren admitted that he only said it was inevitable because he was an idiot who couldn’t make something different happen. Armin, in a final act of compassion, took responsibility for making Eren care about the outside world in the first place and said that they’ll be together again in hell. After embracing one last time, Armin returned to reality to tearfully reconfirm Eren’s death.






This is markedly different from how Eren and Armin&#39;s last interaction went in the manga, where Eren never admitted to his failings and Armin reluctantly thanked him for his sacrifice.






 Attack On Titan’s Ending &amp; True Meaning Explained 
         

With Eren’s death and the destruction of the worm-like creature, not only did the Rumbling end, but all Titan powers ceased to exist, turning all Eldians into normal humans. Three years later, tensions are still high in all corners of the world, the Yeagerists becoming even more radicalized and the outside world still not trusting Eldians. Armin and everyone else acknowledge that people have plenty of reasons to hate them as they head to a peace summit, but even so, Armin believes that there’s still a chance for them to come to an understanding if they have a chance to talk.




Unfortunately, as shown in the end credits, Armin’s ideals wouldn’t come to pass as Paradis Island would be bombed to ruins at some point in the future; it’s unknown how much time passed or if the outside world was truly responsible, but it still shows that despite Eren and Armin’s best efforts, the cycle of violence didn&#39;t come to an end. The final scene shows a boy in the destroyed Paradis discovering the tree Eren was buried under, now resembling the tree where Ymir Fritz gained her Titan powers, implying that he will gain Titan powers, as well.

                  Attack on Titan Ending: Who Lives and Dies in The Final Chapters?   Did the Attack on Titan finale continue its tendency to kill off characters, no matter how important to the story, or popular they might be?   

If Titan powers really can come back, then it’s likely that the fighting will never end, but it’s unknown what the current state of the world is, and if it’s a world without violence, then the new Titan powers could be used as a force for good, or simply not be used at all. Everything is up to interpretation, and that’s likely intentional because for better or worse, the story of the characters everyone knew came to an end with them living out the rest of their lives in peace, and that’s one of the few bright spots in Attack on Titan’s tragic ending.
