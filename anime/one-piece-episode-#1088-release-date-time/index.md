## Literature Review

One Piece episode #1088 will continue the intense battle between Boa, Blackbeard, and Koby as well as showing a bit more of the Straw Hats.




While episode #1087 didn&#39;t focus on the Straw Hats very much, it did establish an exciting conflict to be resolved in One Piece episode #1088. This sort of storytelling could be potentially frustrating to fans who want to see more of Luffy&#39;s adventures, but it is essential for informing viewers of what is happening in the larger world of One Piece. It also is putting the spotlight back on one of the series’ best villains.

 What Happened in Episode #1087 of One Piece? 
          

Episode #1087 began by clarifying why Yamato didn&#39;t join the Straw Hat crew. After Admiral Ryokugyu attacked Wano, Yamato realized that he would have to stay behind to help protect the country from more external threats. This was a welcome explanation, but the main focus of the episode was on Amazon Lily, where the Marines attacked in an attempt to arrest Boa Hancock and her crew. Blackbeard also came to the island with the intent of stealing Boa&#39;s Devil Fruit for himself. In the end, Boa&#39;s powers petrified most of the fighters on the island except for Koby, Blackbeard, and herself. These three powerhouses all began to clash right as the episode ended.






The episode also showed Marco leaving Shanks&#39; ship.






 One Piece Episode #1088 Will Finish the Fight With Blackbeard 
          

Given episode #1087&#39;s cliffhanger, it is almost guaranteed that episode #1088 will show the rest of the battle between Boa, Koby, and Blackbeard. The battle may even force Blackbeard to reveal more about how he can steal Devil Fruit powers, as that hasn&#39;t really been explored further since Marineford. Given episode #1088&#39;s title, it will likely also put the focus on the Straw Hats after the events on Amazon Lily wrap-up.

One Piece is in a bit of a strange place right now leading up to its next arc scheduled to release in early January. However, these interim episodes before the Straw Hats embark on their next big adventure are still very satisfying and can include some major hype moments. Hopefully, One Piece episode #1088 features a moment like this, but even if it doesn&#39;t it should still provide an exciting conclusion to Blackbeard, Boa, and Koby&#39;s fight.
