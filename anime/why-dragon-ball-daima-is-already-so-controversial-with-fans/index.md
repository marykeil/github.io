## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Daima has only just been announced, but many fans are already upset at what this new series could represent for the franchise.




The newly announced Dragon Ball Daima has only just been revealed, but for many fans, there&#39;s already been a negative response to the latest installment. Those who aren&#39;t upset by it can be left to wonder, though, just what exactly about this new Dragon Ball series has these fans so worked up?




Dragon Ball Daima was revealed at New York Comic-Con on October 13, 2023, to a surprising amount of backlash. The new series is supposedly set between Dragon Ball Z and Super, but features kid versions of the entire cast, not just Goku, which did lead to some small amount of confusion at first.

          

The description of the show at the panel suggests that series creator Akira Toriyama has had a large involvement in the production of the series, which would normally be enough to set fans&#39; minds at ease. However, it&#39;s the similarities to past Dragon Ball endeavors that actually has some fans upset the most.

Among fans who have posted about their discontent online, there are three main arguments that seem to be offered as to why they already dislike Daima. By far the most widespread is that the series&#39; premise of having Goku return to being a kid again is far too similar to the series Dragon Ball GT, which also opened with Goku being returned to a young age. Dragon Ball GT was created with minimal input from Toriyama, and was highly controversial among fans, to the point where it was effectively written out of canon when Dragon Ball Super came along. This similarity only seems to be surface level, however, and Toriyama&#39;s confirmed role in its production should ease fears of a GT repeat.

Another major concern among some fans is a desire to see the remaining story arcs of the Dragon Ball Super manga animated, which include the Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga and the Granolah the Survivor Saga. These story arcs are set in space and expand the lore and world of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s universe to a broad degree, and feature some amazing fights that fans can&#39;t wait to see animated. Learning that a new, different anime project is under works means that it&#39;s that much longer until Super&#39;s remaining arcs are animated, which had some fans already grumbling from the moment the new trailer debuted.




Lastly, it seems that some fans simply don&#39;t like the idea of turning the entire cast into Chibi-style child versions of themselves. This is a fair enough criticism on its own, and if one doesn&#39;t like the premise or style, there&#39;s not much that can ultimately be done to win them over. Some fans have behaved in a rational manner and realized that the series might not be for them, while others have been much more rude about their discontent. While Dragon Ball Daima&#39;s debut is still a ways off, hopefully its quality will be able to win back some of these displeased fans and have them regretting their early reactions.
