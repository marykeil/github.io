## Literature Review

Chainsaw Man&#39;s anime is continuing with a movie, Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc, that will adapt the popular Reze arc from the beloved manga.





During the second day of Jump Festa, Chainsaw Man was revealed to continue with a movie that will adapt what is probably its goriest and most heartbreaking arc that will see Denji&#39;s life become even crazier. Chainsaw Man&#39;s official X account confirmed the exciting news in a post saying, &#34;Production of the movie “Chainsaw Man Reze” has been decided!&#34;





 

Although there is little other information besides a key visual and a beautiful teaser put out by Chainsaw Man&#39;s production company MAPPA, that was all it took for social media to go crazy. The upcoming Chainsaw Man movie will cover the fan-favorite Bombgirl arc, and if the teaser is anything to go by, the movie will more than do it justice.

                  10 Scariest Devils In Chainsaw Man   A devil by its nature is a scary thing, but in Chainsaw Man, a devil&#39;s scare factor depends on the emotion, desire, or want they control in humans.   


 Chainsaw Man Movie Has The Potential To Surpass Mugen Train 

 




The teaser shows Denji and Reze, Denji&#39;s new friend and love interest. The two are seen together in the iconic moment from the manga where they go swimming in the middle of the night. The video also shows snippets of Denji&#39;s first true friend as they hang out and have a good time. With a sad melody playing in the background, this movie is sure to leave fans crying throughout.

The teaser also confirms that the movie is currently still in production, meaning it could be sometime before the movie is released. Titled Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc, this new film is sure to contain masterclass animation and sound design, considering how well the Jujutsu Kaisen: 0 movie was adapted. Fans should be excited knowing that Chainsaw Man will receive all possible resources to make it a hit since the CEO of MAPPA stated in an interview with Weekly Toyo Keizai that it was their most successful anime ever.

                  15 Best Studio MAPPA Anime   With around 50 anime series, Studio MAPPA&#39;s best anime run the absolute gamut from gory action, to unique idol series, and even to standard shonen.   




Although nothing is known about the cast and staff, it should be assumed that the voice actors of season 1 will return to their roles. As for the staff, they will be revealed in due time, and we will update this page to reflect that. Lately, there has been an increase in anime movies for canon arcs such as Demon Slayer: Mugen Train. However, Chainsaw Man&#39;s upcoming arc is the perfect fit for a movie: from the length of the manga chapters to be adapted to the action-filled plot that will end in the most depressing way possible. Chainsaw Man has been one of the most exciting new series to release in recent years, and Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc will undoubtedly be an example of anime movies done right.
