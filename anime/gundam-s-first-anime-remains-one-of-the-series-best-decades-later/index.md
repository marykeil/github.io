# Gundam s First Anime Remains One of the Series  Best, Decades Later


## SUMMARY 



  The original Mobile Suit Gundam anime continues to have a lasting impact on the franchise and anime in general, setting the conceptual and thematic precedent for later entries.   Gundam has become a common term for any mech seen in anime, but within the series, &#34;Gundam&#34; refers to a specific Mobile Suit with special technology or construction.   The original Gundam series, with its dark tone and exploration of the emotional toll of war on young pilots, remains one of the best entries in the franchise and is still worth watching.

## Literature Review

The original Mobile Suit Gundam still remains the franchise&#39;s best installment, even after years of new seasons, stories, and characters.




Although The Witch from Mercury broke a lot of ground for the Gundam franchise, it still owes a debt to the original Mobile Suit Gundam anime. The original Gundam is one of the most iconic anime of all time, influencing later entries in the franchise and anime in general for decades. As a show, the original Mobile Suit Gundam still holds up on its own merits.




Mobile Suit Gundam first aired in Japan between 1979 and 1980. The first Gundam series to be released in the United States was actually the sequel series Gundam Wing. However, the success of Gundam Wing prompted a release of the original series in 2001. Later entries in the series have been successful in both Japan and internationally. Many of the later entries continue to follow the conceptual and thematic precedent set all the way back in the original series. One of the clearest indications of the influence of the original Gundam is the fact that &#34;Gundam&#34; has become a shorthand word for any mech. It&#39;s worth noting that within the series itself, the generic term for mech is &#34;Mobile Suit&#34; and a Gundam is a specific kind of Mobile Suit with special technology or construction, though the definition can be unclear and arbitrary at times.

Gundam has never shied away from embracing a dark tone or an unflinching portrayal of the cost of war. This is established right from the opening narration of the very first episode of the original series, with an explanation that Zeon&#39;s independence war against Earth killed half the population of both sides and imagery of a space station being dropped onto a city. Similarly, the series&#39; longstanding tradition of the Gundam pilots being teenagers is established with the original&#39;s protagonist Amuro, along with the fact that the series has never ignored the inevitable emotional and psychological tolls of young people being thrust into the driver&#39;s seat of giant war machines. As cool as the Gundams are, anyone who thinks the main attraction of the series is mindless mech action is missing the point.

          




The original Gundam is 42 episodes long â€” technically 43, but one episode that the series creator and director was dissatisfied with was pulled from international releases. Narratively, that&#39;s long enough to flesh out the story arcs and the characters without relying on filler episodes. Animation has clearly come a long way since 1979, but the art style does have the vintage charm that a lot of old hand-drawn animation has, and the action scenes still hold up well enough. One of the series&#39; most noteworthy aspects is Amuro&#39;s primary rival, Char Aznable, a character so iconic and influential that &#34;Villain Who Looks Like Char&#34; became its own character archetype within the long-running franchise&#39;s later series. He&#39;s probably the most compelling character in the series, competent and capable enough to be a constant threat to the heroes and nuanced enough that he never stops being at least somewhat sympathetic.

Although newer entries in the franchise like Witch from Mercury continue to win new fans and break new ground, every later entry has continued to contain the thematic DNA of the original. Both because of its decades-long influence and for how well it continues to stand on its own right, the original Mobile Suit Gundam continues to be one of the best entries in the franchise.
