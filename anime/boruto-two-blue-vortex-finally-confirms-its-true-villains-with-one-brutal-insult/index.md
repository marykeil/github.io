# Boruto Two Blue Vortex finally Confirms its True Villains With One Brutal Insult


## SUMMARY 



  The emergence of self-aware Divine Trees explains why Boruto villain Code has been disappointing, confirming that he is just a pawn.   Code&#39;s role as a lowly villain isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, as it breaks the formula of previous major villains in the Naruto universe.   The introduction of the Divine Trees as the true new villains provides an unexpected twist and potential for Code&#39;s redemption.

## Literature Review

Code has always been an odd choice for main villain, but now Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #4 has confirmed his status in two brutal ways.




Warning: Spoilers for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex #4The sudden emergence of self-aware and humanoid Divine Trees has confirmed why Boruto&#39;s villain Code has been so pathetic up until now. Moreover, one of these new terrifying characters even calls Code something that has been on the mind of every fan since his lackluster debut: a clown that is just used by others.




As Isshiki&#39;s most faithful follower and the only one who continually survived, Code had always been positioned as the up-and-coming next major villain in both Boruto&#39;s Naruto Next Generations and Two Blue Vortex. This was especially the case upon Isshiki&#39;s defeat when no other villain except him was left.



Both Boruto series are by creator/supervisor Masashi Kishimoto and artist Mikio Ikemoto




          

Yet every chance he had to shine, Code always came up short in Boruto and usually in the most humiliating ways imaginable. However, the introduction of the new Divine Trees and their comment about how they used him to gain self-awareness just confirms Code&#39;s whole role in the series: a clown.





 Boruto Confirms Code Was Never The Big Bad With a Brutal Insult 
         

Code&#39;s latest embarrassment in Boruto chapter #3 suggests that the villain could somehow subvert expectations because it introduced a new low point for the poor villain. While the humanoid Divine Trees do credit him for their new-found self-awareness, they spin his role as them using him. In their words, &#34;It seems it&#39;s your inescapable fate to be a clown, who ends up being used by someone else.&#34; Code&#39;s true purpose is now clearer than ever. He was a red herring for the new Divine Trees, who are the true new villains. And one of them referring to him as a &#34;clown&#34; just cements his lowly status even more.



&#34;It seems it&#39;s your inescapable fate to be a clown who ends up being used by someone else.&#34;







This isn&#39;t a bad thing. Looking back at the franchise, every major villain has been just that - major. Some of them might be disliked more than others, but it&#39;s impossible to deny just how powerful or effective they&#39;ve been. It&#39;s therefore almost ingenious how Boruto broke this formulaic approach from Naruto. This was far from a worthless subversion because it led to the Divine Trees who are some of the coolest and least-expected Boruto villains.



 Boruto&#39;s New Villains Set Up Code&#39;s Redemption 
          

Of course, Boruto has now put Code in a better position to redeem himself. Before now, Code just failed because of his own shortcomings with no other explanation. Here, the Divine Trees are informing him that they used him and then resort to name-calling. Code has more of a reason to seek vengeance against them and the viciousness of his latest embarrassment creates a compelling reason for fans to root for him. Clowns sometimes deserve redemption even if they&#39;re Boruto&#39;s Code.
