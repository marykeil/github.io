## Literature Review

A fourth season of Demon Slayer has been confirmed. Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s publicly known about the next season of the hit anime series.





 The Latest News on Demon Slayer Season 4 

 




Following the Japanese finale of Demon Slayer season 3, the Swordsmith Village arc, it was officially confirmed that Demon Slayer would be continuing into a fourth season. It was announced again more broadly on animation studio ufotable&#39;s X (formerly Twitter) and the official (Japanese) Demon Slayer X account. The announcement simply states that the anime adaptation will continue by adapting the Hashira Training arc from the manga. This announcement was accompanied by character art of five Hashira, focusing on those who haven&#39;t gotten much screen time so far.

On December 11, 2023, a new teaser was released which finally revealed a Demon Slayer season 4 release window: Spring 2024. The teaser and accompanying announcement confirmed that the season would open with a special hour-long episode. It was also announced that a movie comprising the final episodes of the Swordsmith Village arc of season 3 and the first episode of season 4, entitled Demon Slayer: To The Hashira Training, would debut on February 23, 2024.






 The Story of Demon Slayer Season 4 
          

Demon Slayer season 4 will adapt the manga&#39;s Hashira Training arc, which sees Tanjiro getting the training needed to become a Hashira, as the title would suggest. Tanjiro will get to train with the strongest of the Hashira, including those who haven&#39;t appeared much so far, such as Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima. This will offer a nice spotlight on these characters, helping fans to get a better feel for their personalities than the original Hashira meeting scene did.

The Hashira Training arc is only 9 chapters long, however, which is quite short. For comparison, the 11-episode Swordsmith Village arc was 27 chapters long in the manga, meaning each episode adapted about 2 chapters. That would suggest that either season 4 of Demon Slayer will only be 4 or 5 episodes, or that the season will cover more than just this one brief arc. The arc that comes after the Hashira Training arc is the Infinity Castle arc, which at 46 chapters would need a whole season&#39;s worth of episodes itself. Demon Slayer has thus far tried to release whole arcs at once, rather than splitting them across seasons, but that may need to change for season 4. All of this makes it difficult to say how much season 4 will cover at the moment, and only more official details will clarify the issue.






 The Characters of Demon Slayer Season 4 
          

Demon Slayer season 4 will, of course, feature the main cast, but more exciting is the focus on Hashira. Many Hashira, such as the Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima, Serpent Hashira Obanai Iguro, and Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa, have yet to do much in the story, so this will be an excellent time to introduce these characters and get to know them. Tanjiro will spend time training with each of them one-on-one, giving him a chance to build relationships with them that will be invaluable moving into the final arc.

Tanjiro won&#39;t just be training with the Hashira who&#39;ve been out of focus; fan favorites like season 3&#39;s Mitsuri Kanroji and Muichiro Tokito or season 2&#39;s Tengen Uzui will also return to aid in Tanjiro&#39;s training. The story will also catch back up with Zenitsu and Inosuke, who were separated from Tanjiro and sent on other missions, thus leaving them absent from the Swordsmith Village arc. Genya will also be around, and has some issues to work out with his brother, Sanemi.






 Demon Slayer Season 4 Release Date 
          

As of now, there is no known release date for season 4 of Demon Slayer. Demon Slayer season 3 was announced on February 13, 2022, and premiered on April 9, 2023. Demon Slayer Season 4 is now revealed to be debuting in Spring of 2024, which may mean it will have a similar release schedule to season 3. It also may ultimately depend on how many episodes season 4 is intended to be; if it truly does only adapt the Hashira Training arc, it could be quite short, and thus released much sooner (since fewer episodes will be produced).

That&#39;s everything that&#39;s currently known about Demon Slayer season 4, but be sure to check back regularly for updates, trailers, and new information as it becomes available.
