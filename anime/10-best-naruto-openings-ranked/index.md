 10 Best Fights in Naruto, Ranked 
Part 1 of the Naruto anime features several battles that stand the test of time, including these top 10 fights that continue to delight viewers.












 








 10  Heroâ€™s Come Back!! - Nobodyknows&#43; 
Shippuden Opening 1


Hero&#39;s Come Back!! started Naruto Shippuden with the titular ninja returning to Konohagakure. This opening perfectly set the tone for the new series, with its usage of drums and guitar combined with hard Japanese rap lyrics. The visuals featured the cast in their new gear combined with blurred, grainy images. This insinuated that the series would have a much darker and more mature tone, and it was executed perfectly. In some of the most notable English lyrics, &#34;3, 2, 1 make some noise,&#34; are images of Garra, his brother, Konkaro, his sister, Temari, and Naruto showing concern as he vanishes from the screen and a hand is drowning in sand. With dark images of the Akatsuki and The 9 Tails, this first opening sets an exciting yet eerie tone for the series.





 9  Guren (Crimson Lotus) - Does 
Shippuden Opening 15


Naruto Shippuden opening 15 Guren (Crimson Lotus) by Does leads with a powerful guitar lead and dominating display of drums that breaks out into a menacingly paced, head banging, masterpiece that is visually impressive and epic to hear. Crimson Louts captures the depth and malice of the Senju and Uchia feud. Translated lyrics mention, &#34;Heads and tails, good and evil, light and shadow keep looking for the answer in between,&#34; with visuals featuring Naruto and Sasuke with a wavering black line to separate them and a young First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, and Madara Uchiha with a split between them as well.
The song&#39;s lyrics and saturated visuals demonstrated how enemies or opposites can find common ground or die trying. Crimson Lotus remains with a dark dreamlike hue throughout as it showcases the rebirth of the 4 Kage, Neji&#39;s death, the reunion of team 7, the bad blood between Tobirama and Madara, and the battle between Kakashi and Obito.





 8  Blood Circulator - Asian Kung-Fu Generation 
Shippuden Opening 19


The band that seamlessly set the tone for the entirety of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, Asian Kung-Fu Generation, gave fans and opening that stands the test of time with Blood Circulator. From the muffled guitar intro that breaks into an all-out jam session, followed by a voice so strong it sounds like a perfectly played instrument, Naruto Shippuden opening 19 executed a phenomenal close to the War Arc, Naruto&#39;s ultimate villain Kaguya the Rabbit Goddess, Infinite Tsukuyomi, and Naruto vs Sasuke.
The lyrics of Blood Circulator focus on how one should never give up in the face of despair, with visuals of Naruto sinking into darkness while Team 7 continues to press on through battle. Together the lyrics and visuals climax in epic proportion as Naruto rises from darkness, and alongside Sasuke, they charge head first at Kaguya to the solo strings of a guitar and banging of drums.





 7   r - Joe Inoue 
Shippuden Opening 7


The Naruto Shippuden opening that is better known as Shikamaru&#39;s opening uses malefic tones and instrumentals to show the magnitude of the coming battle between the Akatsuki members Hidan and Kakuzu and Asuma Sensai along with his Team 10 and Jonin.  r by Joe Inoue focuses on the importance of life and savoring it while we can, which becomes existentially apparent when Team 10 is faced with the death of Asuma Sensai. The visuals are focused around Shikamaru and it&#39;s all riveting, bringing in goose bump barring excitement that inspires fans to keep moving forward no matter what we&#39;re faced with, even death. This opening is more melodic and calming, but the thrill behind its sequences easily makes it rank among Naruto&#39;s best openings.





 6  GO!!! - Flow 
Naruto Opening 4


&#34;We are fighting dreamers!&#34; Naruto&#39;s fourth opening which is the epitome of early 2000s punk captures everything that fans love about the series. From the head-banging instruments to the lyrics that fans are positive they can speak fluently, Flow convinced every fan they were a rock star. Visuals of characters running across static, pastel Manga panels that moved on the screen, to the eerie glare of Itatchi Uchia&#39;s Sharingan eyes paired with the upbeat vocals of Flow meant that fans were in for a treat with an opening that delivered a catchy and exciting way. Where this opening does not focus on the complex and dark nature of the arc that follows it still is the Naruto opening that captures how exhilarating the series always has and will be, making it one of Naruto&#39;s best openings.





 5  Seishun Kyousoukyoku (Rhapsody of Youth) - Sambomaster 
Naruto Opening 5


Seishun Kysoukyoky (Rhapsody of Youth) by Sambomaster was more than just the fifth opening of Naruto, it was the opening that showed fans when boys become men. This opening was focused around the young ninjas of Konohagakure as they endure a fight for their lives against enemy ninjas of the Sound Village, all in a failed attempt during Sasuke Retrieval Arc, one of Naruto&#39;s best story arcs. Rhapsody of Youth is about a friend who is struggling to accept that their friend is gone, which conveys the overall theme of what Naruto is going through. The opening builds with heartfelt tears from Naruto&#39;s piers, and memories of his good times with Sasuke before it ends with the two slipping away from one another before their series-defining battle. Easily making it one of Naruto&#39;s best-executed openings.





 4  Sign - Flow 
Shippuden Opening 6


Holding the spot for one of Naruto Shippuden&#39;s most impactful, suspenseful, and melancholic openings Sign by Flow showcased the magnitude of events to come. With visually dazzling scenes of Master Jiraiya battling Pain, the Akatsuki standing by as Itatchi and Sasuke&#39;s showdown finally hits the screen, and Naruto becoming consumed by the 9-Tailed Fox this opening was an ever-changing build-up of the stakes&#39; fan&#39;s beloved characters have to endure which led to the ultimate deaths of Jiraiya and Itatchi. Flow executed this song&#39;s somber lyrics excitingly and energetically showing fans that emotions and epic battles were awaiting them. Even without knowing the message behind this opening, it is flawless and ethereal in every way.





 3  Haruka Kanata (Far Away) - Asian Kung-Fu Generation 
Naruto Opening 2


The opening that deserves to be at the top, Haruka Kanata (Far Away) by Asian Kung-Fu Generation only failed at not delivering one of the greatest anime openings of all time. What&#39;s so special about this opening is that this is when the series took off. Little is shown visually of the events to come, yet the foreshadowing is so impactful that it is only amplified by the jam session that is used to show viewers. Scenes of the teams that passed the first portion of Naruto&#39;s iconic Chunin Exams followed by various action sequences of the young shinobi, Orochimaru&#39;s eyes on Sasuke, and the evil within Garra, are shared with us by lyrics that translate to proving oneself. The perfect message for this arc where Naruto and his friends battle to show their skills, survive, and advance.





 2  Blue Bird - Ikimino Gakari 
Shippuden Opening 3


Blue Bird by Ikimino Gakari is the opening in which Naruto fans gather together to chant at the top of their lungs and for good reason. Blue Bird is about the fleeting nature of happiness and how it can be hard to hold onto, especially when things seem difficult, it is important to be determined to keep moving on. The uplifting melody of Blue Bird is what captivates the fans of Naruto and J-Pop as it tells us that we all have a bluebird inside of us waiting to be set free and the visuals of the opening show this as a bluebird is used to transition the scenes around the central characters. Though it was played during one of Naruto Shippuden&#39;s filler arcs, Blue Bird&#39;s visuals begin focusing on the distance Sasuke has put between him and Konohagakure, and how all the shinobi have accepted this except for Naruto, for whom it is especially difficult to let Sasuke go. This opening is as beautiful as its message.





 1  Silhouette - Kana-Boon 
Shippuden Opening 16


The pinnacle of Naruto openings was bestowed upon fans during the culmination of the War Arc. Silhouette by Kana-Boon is nearly ineffable and is nothing short of a masterpiece. From the opening of the pivotal characters to the monochromatic visuals of the journey fans have gone on up until this point. Seeing the main title Naruto burn into the screen and then burst to life like a phoenix, the first fourteen seconds alone of Silhouette trumps every other opening the series has created.
The visuals are superb in their execution of showing the development of the two main villains, Obito Uchia and Madara Uchia, and the growth of the main protagonist Naruto in stunning transformation running animations. Silhouette outlines what a Naruto opening should be, it is visually mesmerizing, melancholic, action-packed, and presents the gravity of the conflict. The lyrics pair perfectly with the visuals and the tone is so inspirational it always brings tears and chills to fans.
Naruto is a massive series, so it&#39;s only natural that it would have so many openings. More than just space fillers though, genuine thought and care were put into both the music and the visuals of each and every one of the series&#39; openings, leading to some of the best openings in anime history. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden&#39;s openings effortlessly convey the series&#39; themes and messages alongside some truly incredible music. Naruto&#39;s best openings of all serve as great reminders of what makes the franchise so special to this day.
Both Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden are available now on Crunchyroll!
