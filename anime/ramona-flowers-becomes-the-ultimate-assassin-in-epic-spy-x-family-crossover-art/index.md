## Literature Review

In an epic piece of crossover fanart, artist Dkajda has brought Ramona Flowers into the world of Spy X Family as the ultimate assassin.




An epic fanart crossover with Spy X Family has turned Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&#39;s Ramona Flowers into the ultimate assassin, Yor. When Ramona took the lead in the recent Scott Pilgrim anime, fans applauded just how well the series fleshed out her character. Not only did it free her of the infamous Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope, but it also explored her backstory and flaws to make her one of the show&#39;s most talked about characters. This has resulted in a huge surge in fanart surrounding Ramona, including an epic new piece that has turned her into one of anime&#39;s deadliest assassins.




Artist Dkajda recently shared with their followers on X a crossover for the ages as Ramona takes the role of Yor Forger from Spy X Family, best known as the Thorn Princess. Yor has become famous for being one of the deadliest assassins in the medium as she ruthlessly kills her targets without ever getting caught.


 

Here, Ramona has filled her boots as she dons her iconic assassin dress while wielding Yor&#39;s infamous blades to complete the look while her iconic hammer from the Scott Pilgrim series lies next to her. This is an incredible piece of fanart that not only captures the art style of Takes Off perfectly but makes Ramona feel right at home in the world of Spy x Family as well.

                  Spy x Family&#39;s Yor &amp; Komi Can&#39;t Communicate Fuse in Adorable Fanart   In an adorable piece of fanart from Princess Hinghoi Lite, Yor from Spy x Family and Komi from Komi Can&#39;t Communicate get an amazing fusion form!   





 Ramona&#39;s New Assassin Abilities Make Her a Threat to the League of Evil Exes 
          

What&#39;s fun about this piece of fanart by Dkajda though is the speculation surrounding how this could transform Ramona&#39;s fighting style. She&#39;s already been depicted as a brawler with a mastery of handling blunt weaponry such as her iconic hammer. If she were to gain Yor&#39;s abilities as an assassin though, it would make her a total threat to be reckoned with. She would be much more nimble and able to evade attacks even easier than she&#39;s already capable. This would defeat the purpose of Ramona facing the Exes in Takes Off since the anime focuses on redefining their roles to make them more complex, but it would make for an interesting change in fighting style that they would never see coming.



 Yor Would Find Enjoyment in the Scott Pilgrim Universe 
          




Of course, the speculation behind a crossover of two very different properties goes two ways. How would Yor fit in being the new Ramona? Surprisingly, she&#39;d find some enjoyment in it. It&#39;s well established in Spy X Family that Yor has a fascination with weaponry to the point where she gets overexcited at dinner cutlery. If she were to gain access to Ramona&#39;s Subspace Suitcase, she would be in heaven as she uses it to house as many weapons as she can to fight off any enemies coming her way. Since Toronto, Canada in the Scott Pilgrim universe is littered with overexaggerated antagonists willing to pick a fight, Yor would undoubtedly find herself living in the best possible place to both hone her skills and express her enjoyment of assassin work with an endless supply of weapons to keep her going.

Despite the two series being incredibly different in premise, Dkajda&#39;s crossover artwork shows that Ramona and Yor could switch places in the best way. It&#39;s a perfect crossover between Scott Pilgrim and Spy X Family that blends what works best about both franchises while adding some personality to make Ramona fit in with the anime&#39;s tone. This could be just the beginning for Ramona Flowers crossing over with other anime characters as her popularity continues to rise.
