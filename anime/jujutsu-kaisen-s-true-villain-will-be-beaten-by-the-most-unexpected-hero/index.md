## Literature Review

Kenjaku has been portrayed as something of an invincible villain in Jujutsu Kaisen, but chapter #239 sets him up to be defeated by an unexpected hero.





Fortunately, Jujutsu Kaisen chapter #239 looks as if it’s finally going to alleviate that regarding Kenjaku as he’s set up to fight Fumihiko Takaba. Takaba has been nothing but comedic relief since his debut, even being an in-universe stand-up comedian, so on a surface level, the idea that he could beat someone like Kenjaku might seem utterly ridiculous.




          

However, the way that Takaba’s cursed technique works makes him one of the few people who reasonably could deal with someone like Kenjaku, so despite how largely unimportant Takaba has been, he presents the best chance for Kenjaku to finally be defeated.

 Takaba Can Defeat Kenjaku With Jujutsu Kaisen’s Strongest Cursed Technique 
          

The way that Takaba can defeat Kenjaku is due to his cursed technique possibly being the strongest in all of Jujutsu Kaisen. Takaba’s cursed technique, Comedian, lets him make anything happen as long as he thinks it’s funny, and when his technique was first revealed, it was explicitly stated that it would even let him fight Gojo. Despite his personality, Takaba is easily one of the most powerful characters in Jujutsu Kaisen thanks to the incredible versatility of his cursed technique, so if he’s being matched against Kenjaku, then it’s highly likely that this could be where Kenjaku’s finally defeated.




There are some caveats to be had, of course. Takaba has been noted to not fully understand how Comedian works, so that could impact the effectiveness of it and prevent him from using it to its fullest extent. Not only that but since the upcoming fight will be the first extensive use of Comedian, it might be revealed to have some limitations that keep it from being too overpowered that Kenjaku could easily take advantage of and eke out another victory. Regardless, Takaba does currently have the best chance of defeating Kenjaku, so it will still be interesting to see how their fight plays out.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Forces Popular Manga To Go On Hiatus Out Of Shock   The events of Jujutsu Kaisen chapter #236 have left a major mark on fans of the series, and they&#39;ve even caused a popular manga to go on hiatus.   



 Kenjaku’s Potential Defeat Would Be His Most Fitting Death In Jujutsu Kaisen 
          




If Takaba does defeat Kenjaku, then it would be the most fitting death Kenjaku could suffer in Jujutsu Kaisen. Like many other villains in the series, Kenjaku does nothing but look down on and insult those he considers inferior, and chapter #239 even had him look down on Takaba by saying that Higuruma was the only awakened sorcerer with any potential. With that level of arrogance, seeing Kenjaku be defeated by someone who was written off as nothing but a joke, despite the power of his cursed technique, would be incredibly ironic, and it would easily be the most fitting end to Jujutsu Kaisen’s overarching villain.
