## Literature Review

The best anime eye catches stand out for the ways that they incorporate animation, images, music and more to create memorable interludes. 




Anime eye catches are the little animations or title cards that occur when an anime goes on an intermission or commercial break. They&#39;re often characterized by the music or sounds played during them, the images and animations displayed, and the logo or name of the series in question. Eye catches seem to serve a lot of different purposes; they draw attention back after a break, carry on the overall tone of the series, offer some insight into the characters and world, and much more! With all of that in consideration, it makes sense that a lot of thought goes into the creation of anime eye-catches.
While some anime put little thought into their eye-catches, others can use these short little animations to great effect. The best anime eye-catches stand out for the many fantastic and thoughtful artistic choices made during their creation. 









 








 10  Haikyu!! 
        

 Haikyu!!&#39;s eye catches are adorable brief scenes that change throughout the seasons. In the beginning, they show various characters attempting to serve a volleyball over the net to hit a plastic bottle on the opposite side. Sometimes these feature a single character or several character interactions. When the anime makes a shift in their eye catches, it becomes a small scene of animal versions of characters interacting. For example, a small round crow Hinata flying across the screen or cat versions of Kenma and Kuro. These scenes are all cute and fit the series&#39; tone and themes perfectly, making Haikyu!!&#39;s eye-catches easily ranks among the best in anime history. 





 9  Hunter x Hunter (Both Versions) 
        

Both versions of Hunter x Hunter&#39;s anime have equally interesting commercial break images and animations. For the 1999 version, there&#39;s typically colored-in concept art of characters or creatures in the series. In the 2011 version, there&#39;s a character introducing the audience to vocabulary in the Hunter x Hunter world, such as character names. The Hunter x Hunter alphabet, which is demonstrated in these scenes, consists of symbols based on Japanese hiragana and katakana. These scenes do a great job of informing fans about the world and characters, doing a lot with such a small amount of time.





 8  One Piece 
        

As a result of the length of the series, One Piece has several different eye-catch animations. Several of the more common ones involve shots of the crew or scenes of their updated wanted posters blowing by. They have specific intermissions for some of their episode specials, such as the One Piece, Toriko, and Dragon Ball Z collaboration. The wanted poster ones in particular are iconic because they exist throughout the series and show how both the style of the anime has changed and how the characters are depicted over time. 





 7  Yu Yu Hakusho 
        

 The Yu Yu Hakusho anime intermission is a classic and features the main cast in a chibi-fied form. When several small eye bats from the Beasts of Maze Castle arc fly onto the screen, Yusuke and the gang are ready. After defeating the bats, each one turns into the characters spelling out the series&#39; title. To straighten out the characters, Yusuke fires mini spirit guns. Botan flies in off-screen and Koenma falls down on Kuwabara (sorry, buddy) from above. The scenes are undeniably cute and capture the spirit of the series&#39; lead characters perfectly, making them some of the best anime eye-catches.





 6  All Saints Street 
        

 All Saints Street is an animated series based on a Chinese webcomic. The series is a delightful show available on Crunchyroll and frequently has some of the most adorable eye-catches in anime history. The eye-catches are typically different every time and relate to the events of the previous scene. Sometimes they depict one of the main characters on their own or interacting with others, but always stand out as a charming addition to the prior scenes.





 5  Pokémon 
        

Another classic example of a good eye catch is the &#39;Who&#39;s That Pokémon?&#39; section of the Pokémon series. It features a silhouetted image of a Pokémon with a voiceover asking &#34;Who&#39;s that Pokémon?&#34;. The second half fills in the image of the Pokémon, offers an answer, and also includes the audio of what that Pokémon sounds like in the show. Similar to some other eye catches, this one serves to give audiences more information about the world of the series. This is easily one of the most iconic anime eye-catches ever, as any fan who watched the Pokémon anime will undeniably be familiar with them.





 4  Demon Slayer 
        

Demon Slayer&#39;s eye catches often showcase close-ups and overall shots of dynamic art of the show&#39;s characters. They typically feature the character in a scene that is relevant to the current portion of the story, further showing off the beauty of the visuals in the Demon Slayer anime. The art will sometimes take up a portion of the screen or its entirety depending on the composition. The effectiveness of the choices made in these intermissions proves that there are a variety of different eye-catches that tend to grab the viewers&#39; attention in different ways.





 3  Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun 
        

 Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun&#39;s intermission sections, like many other series, typically contain an image related to recent events in the anime coupled with the show&#39;s logo. The image shown above is from episode 4, showing an image of a character from the game that Mikoto and Nozaki played together. Other types of imagery involve the cast members and their silly antics and various character interactions, all accompanied by one of the show&#39;s character&#39;s calling out &#34;Gekkan-Shoujo Nozaki-kun!&#34; 





 2  Cowboy Bebop 
        

 Like many other great anime eye-catches, the eye-catches in Cowboy Bebop are really evocative of the show&#39;s overall tone. These intermissions make use of a lot of different font types displaying the show&#39;s name in conjunction with the occasional images shown in black and white or limited color. The layout of the font and the design of the graphics shifts in different episodes and yet their appearances on their own all feel like they&#39;re part of the same property (even without the inclusion of the series&#39; name). 





 1  Cardcaptor Sakura 
        

Cardcaptor Sakura is another good example of an anime eye-catch that really stands out. In Cardcaptor Sakura, during a commercial break, there&#39;s a solid color background and a circle with the name of the series displayed in it. In addition to that, the viewer gets an image of the back of a Clow Card that spins and reveals one of the main characters portrayed on it themselves. It&#39;s cute, contains plenty of iconography that leaves no question as to what the viewer is watching, and continues the overarching tone of the series.
Anime eye catches are a great way to draw the audience&#39;s attention back from a commercial and offer them more glimpses of the anime&#39;s overall world. They can depict fun or amusing character interactions, add drama with graphic and bold illustrations, or serve up cute animations that leave a lasting impression. When it comes to the creation of all the different components that make an animated series, the thought put behind the best anime eye-catches really highlights them as another inspired element.
