## Literature Review

The &#34;Visions of Coleus&#34; OVA has been picked up by Crunchyroll, allowing the short story to join the rest of the anime on the streaming service.




Streaming service Crunchyroll announced that it would be hosting the OVA side story for That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, subtitled Visions of Coleus. It will be available at the very end of October. The story, which originally came packed with physical Blu-ray cases, will be available for all fans of the isekai anime to experience.




The OVA serves as an interquel between the events of Season 1 and Season 2. As a short story, it doesn&#39;t provide exhaustive or revelatory plot elements for the future.


 

Nonetheless, for fans of the series who have been waiting to see more of Rimuru, this is the chance they have been waiting for.

                  That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&#39;s Orc War Arc is Still Its Best   The Orc War in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime offered the characters their first big challenge, making it into the show&#39;s most memorable arc.

Crunchyroll&#39;s official synopsis for the OVA says:


Rimuru has saved the children he was teaching in the Kingdom of Engrassia, and his time as a teacher is nearly over. Then Yuuki, Grandmaster of the Free Union, asks him to get to the bottom of the race for the throne in the Kingdom of Coleus, which is located between Engrassia and the Holy Empire of Lubelius. So Rimuru infiltrates Coleus under the name &#34;Satoru,&#34; and he finds a nation at the mercy of not only a battle for succession, but a web of schemes woven by demons and vampires!


Visions of Coleus has a curious release history. Written by the light novel&#39;s author, Fuse, the original material was an added freebie that came packed with each Blu-ray disc for the animated adaptation&#39;s second season. The studio responsible, Eight Bit, clearly saw its potential for an adapation. The OVA will come in three episodes; Crunchyroll announced that it would stream Visions of Coleus on October 31, while it airs in Japan on November 1. This is the first Slime anime in a while, with Season 2 concluding in 2021, while Season 3 of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is due in the spring of next year.




Given the premise of the story involves Rimuru traveling alone to an isolated and unrelated location, with none of the secondary cast of the main story appearing, it is unlikely that Visions of Coleus will be considered &#34;essential viewing&#34; for new fans of the isekai. In other words, the OVA is as truly a &#34;side story&#34; as it gets. Nonetheless, it&#39;s an excellent appetizer ahead of the next incoming season and, at the very least, a compact and tidy little adventure for fans who don&#39;t have the energy to watch or rewatch all 48 episodes of the slime&#39;s prior antics.

While numerous isekai and fantasy anime are still coming out, including seasonal darlings like Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End, it is still nice to see a story that was normally locked away in a disc case become available worldwide. The fact Crunchyroll managed an international broadcast near simultaneously with Japan only goes to show both its influence and the popularity of Slime even after a multi-year break and a season that was unfortunately delayed by Covid-19. At any rate, fans of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ought to keep an eye on Crunchyroll when Visions of Coleus arrives.




That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.
