Throughout the history of the mech genre, these powerful machines have become instantly recognizable by anime fans because of their impressive performances and awe-inspiring power. From giant robots to brilliant artificial intelligence to cybernetic super-soldiers, memorable mechs have a long history of inspiring awe in audiences. With proven impressive power and an influence that continues to be felt, these icons stand out from other anime mechs as truly the most important in the history of the genre.









 








 9  The Knightmare Frames - Code Geass 
        

While the real driving factor of the series is Lelouch&#39;s geass powers that allow him to compel others to do as he commands, the Knightmare Frame mechs are a major element of the setting. The series&#39; backstory, the Knightmare Frames are the primary reason Britannia was able to conquer Japan in the first place, establishing the main conflict driving the series and setting into motion Lelouch&#39;s entire plan with his geass powers. The Knightmare Frames are also a major component of the recurring action of the series, which centers on the frequent use of the Knightmare Frames as powerful weapons.





 8  Chamber - Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet 
        

When Ledo and his Caliber, the mech he pilots, are transported across space and time via a wormhole, the mech&#39;s AI system Chamber quickly proves its use in the strange new world they find themselves. Taken in by the nomadic fleet based on a large ship called Gargantia, Ledo quickly proves a valuable asset in combat while piloting Chamber, providing firepower the enemy pirates are incapable of matching. On the other hand, Chamber also proves useful in several boring but practical and hugely important ways. Chamber is able to translate the other characters&#39; language, allowing Ledo to communicate with them, and also serves as a forklift for the crew of the Gargantia.





 7  The Patlabors - Patlabor 
        

While fairly small and unassuming compared to other well-known anime mechs, the eponymous mechs of Patlabor are notable for being presented as a particular component of everyday life in the setting. Fundamentally, Patlabor is a workplace comedy like The Office or Brooklyn Nine-Nine, centering around a group of otherwise fairly mundane and down-to-earth characters who are police that just happen to pilot mechs as their day job. Patlabors may not have the raw power of other anime mechs, but Patlabor does examine how the mechs of the setting would actually work and how everyday life would be affected by the widespread adoption of mechs in society. Patlabors may be lacking in power, but they&#39;re fascinating as a story concept.





 6  Adam Smasher - Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 
       Adam Smasher in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners  

Cyberpunk-genre stories don&#39;t usually have happy endings, and Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s award-winning anime spin-off is no exception. Throughout the Cyberpunk franchise&#39;s incarnations across various mediums - the original tabletop game, the 2077 video game, and the Edgerunners anime - Arasaka&#39;s cybernetic super-soldier Adam Smasher has been a formidable enemy. This is demonstrated in a clear and brutal fashion in Edgerunners. Adam Smasher&#39;s horrifying and effortless dismantling of the heroes is a large reason why Lucy is the series&#39; sole survivor.





 5  Mechagodzilla City - Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle 
        

While the trilogy of Godzilla anime films was not well-received by fans, particularly notable is how the anime trilogy reimagined Mechagodzilla. At first appearing to be a city created from the remnants of the destroyed Mechagodzilla, it is ultimately revealed that the living nanometal Mechagodzilla City is made of threatens to eventually absorb the entire planet and every living thing on it, including the protagonists. While the Godzilla anime trilogy stumbles for other reasons, it does take Mechagodzilla&#39;s traditionally formidable power in an interesting new direction to establish Mechagodzilla as a major threat in a nightmarish new way.





 4  The Fool - Nobunaga the Fool 
        

Despite all of the characters being based on real historical figures, Nobunaga the Fool is a Steampunk Space Opera, a conceptually fascinating twist on a historical Fantasy anime. In the series, Feudal Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga is reincarnated into a world consisting of two warring planets inhabited by other reincarnated historical figures, where he becomes pilot of a powerful mech destined to be used by the Savior King of prophecy. Combining Nobunaga&#39;s natural talent with a legendary mech makes for some truly memorable action scenes.





 3  Dann of Thursday - Gun X Sword 
       The mech Dann of Thursday from Gun X Sword.  

One of the Original Seven, mechs named for the days of the week built to keep the peace on the planet of Endless Illusion, Dann is piloted by Gun X Sword&#39;s hero Van and enters its battles dropping from orbit in the shape of a giant sword. As Van pursues vengeance against a man known as the Claw, he pilots Van against countless other mechs, culminating in facing off with the other six mechs of the Original Seven, whose pilots have all joined with the Claw. Van is able to achieve victory by learning to unlock Dann&#39;s full potential and access the mech&#39;s previously hidden powers and abilities.





 2  Gurren Lagann - Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 
        

The combined form of the two main mechs of the series, Guren and Lagann, is largely defined by its ability to constantly unlock new powers. This baseline combined form the two mechs attains more powerful and larger forms. Since Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann constantly strives to outdo itself and bring its action over the top again and again, Gurren Lagann&#39;s final form is the single largest mech ever represented in anime, becoming larger than the entire observable universe.
The EVA Units - Neon Genesis Evangelion
        

Ostensibly built to combat the alien threat of the Angels, the exact purpose of the EVA units becomes clear as the plot of Evangelion unfolds. While they are undeniably powerful weapons, the EVAs&#39; true purpose is so much more. Fittingly for a series so steeped in religious and mythological symbolism and metaphors, the EVAs are godlike beings with the potential to rewrite reality. The EVAs&#39; godlike power is made particularly clear in the Rebuild of Evangelion spin-off films, which involves an irate Shinji precipitating the Third Impact and causing the films&#39; plot to veer drastically away from that of its source materials





 1  RX-78-2 Gundam - Mobile Suit Gundam 
        

While perhaps outclassed in sheer size and power on paper by other anime mechs, the original RX-78-2 Gundam is nevertheless presented as a gamechanging super-weapon in its home series. The original Gundam&#39;s most significant power, is the real-life influence it&#39;s had on Pop Culture as perhaps the most iconic mech of all time. In addition to kicking off the entire Mobile Suit Gundam series that has produced dozens of sequels and spin-offs across decades, the original Gundam has proven hugely influential on later anime mechs, inspiring both designs and storytelling.
These anime mechs have deservedly become icons of the genre over the years: they won important battles and went on to amaze audiences and influence later stories for generations. These mighty machines are some of the most memorable and important figures in the history of anime. The iconic mechs have a proven legacy of both incredible power and a huge influence on the genre.
