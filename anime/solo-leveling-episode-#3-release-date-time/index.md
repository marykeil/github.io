 What Happened In Solo Leveling Episode #2? 
          

Episode #2 of Solo Leveling adapted the beginning of the series&#39; main plot. It picked up where the previous episode left off, with Sung Jinwoo and his colleagues being trapped in the dungeon with high-level monsters. Jinwoo&#39;s many near-death experiences sharpened his survival skills, as he was able to predict what the monsters were about to do and save who he could. He gradually figured out the rules of the dungeon and was thus able to help the others survive. Despite being the weakest hunter in the world, he was the MVP of the day and his calm demeanor in a high-stakes situation led him to save Joohee and the others.




Unfortunately for our hero, he lost his leg, and with him and Joohee being unable to move, the captain had to carry Joohee out of the dungeon and leave Jinwoo behind. As he accepted his impending death, he bravely picked up a sword to not die a meaningless death. He was completely overpowered by the statues, and a bloodbath ensued. He was stabbed, cut, smashed, and subjected to ultimate pain before being finished off. However, a loading screen appeared before him 0.2 seconds before he died, asking if he wanted to become a &#34;player&#34;.



 Solo Leveling&#39;s Third Episode Will Showcase Jinwoo&#39;s Unique Powers 
          

In episode #3, Jinwoo will wake up miraculously alive and slowly discover that he has gained a unique power in the world of Hunters: the ability to level up. He will also decide to enter a dungeon to test the new powers he has acquired. The real story finally begins, as Jinwoo now has the faculty to improve his powers greatly. The first two episodes featured great animation but also did not shy away from the gory and violent nature of the source material. The first iconic panel was also adapted perfectly, making Solo Leveling fans hopeful that the series will be done justice.




Solo Leveling episode #3 will air on Saturday, January 20th, only on Crunchyroll.
