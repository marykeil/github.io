## Literature Review

Scouting the location, analyzing their targets, and figuring out the most efficient methods to finish the job, these assassins are the deadliest.





Some assassins live in more grounded worlds, relying on nothing but their strength, speed, and killing techniques, while others incorporate fantastical or supernatural powers into their jobs. Yet, what they all have in common is that they maximize efficiency, typically seeking to take out their targets in as few moves as possible, ideally while remaining completely undetected. As if putting on a show for the viewers, they elevate killing into a calculated art.

After leaving the circus, he makes use of his acrobatic skills in his new line of work, moving effortlessly in any environment and taking out his targets with ease.

Considering assassination involves taking out targets in a stealthy manner, the process always requires not only techniques polished through rigorous training and experience, but also a keen awareness of one&#39;s surroundings. Being strong is simply not enough, as paid killers need to be able to complete their objectives without leaving so much as a trace that would reveal their real identity. In a field as dangerous as this, only the best can rise to the top without dying, which is exactly what these anime assassins have managed to accomplish.
