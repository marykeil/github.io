## Literature Review

It&#39;s not surprising that Eiichiro Oda&#39;s beloved series has been so influential on many manga and anime that have come after. 




One Piece is the best-selling manga series of all time and has been consistently popular for decades. It&#39;s not surprising that Eiichiro Oda&#39;s beloved series has been so influential on many manga and anime that have come after. The best anime that follow One Piece&#39;s legacy capture the series&#39; spirit while adding something fresh.
One Piece has an instantly identifiable art style and tone, with recognizable character designs and a plot that deftly balances epic action and frequent humor. The handful of anime series that best capture One Piece&#39;s spirit evoke this style and tone. At the same time, the creators of these series have demonstrated themselves to be creative enough to tread new ground at the same time, paying homage to the influence of One Piece without falling into being overly derivative.









 








 10  Drifting Dragons Turns the Sky into an Ocean of Adventure 
Based on The Manga By Taku Kuwabara


 







  Release Year   2020    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch   Netflix    
Like One Piece, Drifting Dragons follows the crew of a ship as they adventure. Drifting Dragons follows the steampunk airship Quin Zaza, a draking ship that serves as the world&#39;s equivalent to real-life Early Modern whaling vessels. On the whole, Drifting Dragons is much more laid-back than One Piece and is fundamentally a slice-of-life series, though one set in a fictional, fantastical world. The main draw of the series is the interaction and relationship between the crew of the Quin Zaza, which is powerful enough to make Drifting Dragons one of the best steampunk anime.





 9  The Tower of Druaga is a Blend of Adventure and Comedy 
Based on The 1984 Video Game By Namco
        

  Release Year   2008    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Watch   Crunchyroll    
The original inspiration for The Tower of Druaga is an infamously difficult and confusing 80s arcade game. Both the game and the anime follow the heroes&#39; quest to climb the Tower of the title and slay the evil god at the top to be given a wish. Despite the epic mythological grandeur of the premise, The Tower of Druaga is primarily a very off-the-wall comedy. The series&#39;s excellent mix of genuinely hilarious comic moments with an epic adventure and exciting action sequences are stylistically very similar to One Piece. Additionally, both One Piece and The Tower of Druaga are excellent Fantasy series that don&#39;t rely on Isekai plots.





 8  Pokémon Horizons is a Whimsical Adventure 
The Latest Anime Adaptation of the Long-Running Franchise Based on The Video Game Series
        

  Release Year   2023    Number of Episodes   30 (currently airing)    Where to Watch   Currently unavailable to stream    
In her journey, Liko is helped by the Rising Volt Tacklers, Pokémon&#39;s equivalent to the Straw Hat Pirates. Although the Rising Volt Tacklers are more researchers than pirates, they&#39;re still a tight-knit crew of heroes with big personalities. Much like the Straw Hats, the Rising Volt Tacklers can also handle themselves in a fight. While the Rising Volt Tacklers technically travel by airship, they still really lean into the adventurous seafarer character concept. Part of the reason Captain Pikachu is the best new character is because he plays to the archetypal grizzled old sea captain character as much as a Pokémon can. Although Pokémo Horizons is more laid-back and less action-oriented than One Piece, the two series share a creative artistic spirit and are permeated by a great sense of adventure.





 7  My Hero Academia&#39;s Quirks Are Like Devil Fruit Powers 
Based on The Manga By Kōhei Horikoshi


 







  Release Year   2016    Number of Episodes   138 &#43; 9 OVAs (currently airing)    Where to Watch   Crunchyroll    
My Hero Academia&#39;s most important rule is that 80% of people are born with Quirks which grant them superpowers. This means that the world of My Hero Academia is brimming with characters who possess unique and stylish superpowers, with the very best Quirks being memorable both artistically and conceptually. In both One Piece and My Hero Academia, the main appeal of the action is encounters between super-powered individuals with stylish abilities. Both One Piece creator Eiichiro and My Hero Academia creator Kōhei Horikoshi have really flexed their creative and artistic muscles in giving their characters cool powers and realizing those powers with fantastic visual designs.

 6  Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is Set on an Ocean World 
An Original Anime Series By Production I.G directed By Kazuya Murata
        

  Release Year   2013    Number of Episodes   13 &#43; 4 OVAs    Where to Watch   Crunchyroll    
Following the time-displaced soldier Ledo and Chamber, the highly intelligent and powerful combat mech he pilots, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet takes place on a world flooded after the end of an ice age. The human inhabitants of this world survive on the planet-wide ocean in nomadic convoys of ships, with larger-than-life pirates as a constant threat. Gargantia has sci-fi elements not shared by One Piece, although it shares the basic premise of adventures in an ocean world filled with pirates. Thanks to being a sci-fi series featuring a sentient mech as one of its major characters, Gargantia is able to put a novel spin on the premise. Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet shares the spirit of One Piece in many ways, while also adding new elements to its story and world-building that allow it to stand out as distinct.





 5  Kill la Kill Features Quirky Powers, Stylish Art, and an Oppressive Government 
Original Anime Series By Studio Trigger &amp; Directed By Hiroyuki Imaishi
        

  Release Year   2013    Number of Episodes   24 &#43; 1 OVA    Where to Watch   Crunchyroll    
Although Kill la Kill is more mature than One Piece, it actually shares a lot of elements with One Piece. Stylistically, Kill la Kill makes the most of its cartoonish art direction to allow for greatly exaggerated and larger-than-life character interactions, especially with its fight scenes. Conceptually, both Kill la Kill and One Piece feature heroes and villains with cool powers. In Kill la Kill, the characters use school uniforms that grant them special powers and techniques. Heroine Ryuko&#39;s powers come from her uniform, which is actually a sentient alien. Finally, although the world Kill la Kill is notably darker and more dystopian than One Piece&#39;s, the oppressive World Government looms over the setting of One Piece in a way similar to the Honnouji Academy Student Council and Kiryuin Conglomerate rule over the setting of Kill la Kill.





 4  Edens Zero Takes a Familiar Concept Into Space 
Based on The Manga By Hiro Mashima
        

  Release Year   2021    Number of Episodes   50    Where to Watch   Netflix (Season 1), Crunchyroll (Season 2)    
As the follow-up work to Fairy Tail by Hiro Mashima, Edens Zero has often unfairly been written off as Fairy Tail in space. While Mashima does obviously make deliberate references to Fairy Tail while writing Edens Zero, the series actually feels a lot more like a sci-fi version of One Piece. Like One Piece, Edens Zero follows the crew of a ship on a quest to seek out a mythical goal. Where the Straw Hats are searching for the One Piece treasure, the crew of the Edens Zero is searching for Mother, the Goddess of the Cosmos. Just like One Piece, the plot is driven by the protagonist building a crew for his journey and their growing friendships eventually leading to them becoming a team of trusted companions.





 3  BNA: Brand New Animal&#39;s Heroine is a Lot Like Luffy 
An Original Anime Series By Studio Trigger Directed by Yoh Yoshinari
        

  Release Year   2020    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Watch   Netflix    
BNA: Brand New Animal follows Michiru, a previously normal human girl who has been suddenly transformed into a Beastman. Specifically, Michiru has become a tanuki, an animal long associated with shapeshifting in Japanese mythology. BNA fully embraces this mythological inspiration, giving Michiru a full slate of shapeshifting powers. Although Michiru never displays an exact equivalent of Luffy&#39;s rubbery Gum-Gum powers, her ability to change her physical form in creative ways is certainly reminiscent of Luffy&#39;s similar powers. Michiru also shares personality traits with Luffy. Both are kindhearted, friendly characters who prefer not to fight, but are capable of fighting with intense ferocity when pushed.





 2  My Bride is a Mermaid Features a Colorful Cast of Fish-People 
Based on the Manga By Tahiko Kimura
        

  Release Year   2007    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Watch   Funimation    
The villainous Arlong largely serves as One Piece&#39;s first introduction to the Fish-Men, as well as the central figure of one of One Piece&#39;s best story arcs. Since then, Fish-Men have become an important part of the series. While also driven by its cast of merpeople, My Bride is a Mermaid, largely uses the concept to create comedic moments. The plot is set into motion by the mermaid Sun rescuing the human Nagasumi, who is then obligated to marry her. Although the merpeople of My Bride is a Mermaid aren&#39;t particularly fond of humans, they&#39;re less openly hostile to humans than the Fish-Men of One Piece. There are fewer moments of true conflict and much more general cultural shock. In particular, much of the series&#39; comedy comes from the fact that Sun&#39;s family are depicted as a Yakuza clan who live by a deliberately exaggerated gangster code of honor.





 1  Bodacious Space Pirates is the Next Best Anime About Pirates 
Based on the light novels by Yūichi Sasamoto.


 







  Release Year   2012    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Watch   HiDive    
While One Piece is the most famous anime about pirates, Bodacious Space Pirates is a better example of how piracy actually works. In fact, despite being set in the far future and 12 light years from Earth in the Tau Ceti system, Bodacious Space Pirates presents a system of piracy that is directly modeled on piracy in the historical Golden Age of Piracy, with the space pirates being hired by third parties and sanctioned by letters of marque. The major instance of artistic license taken by the series is that it basically depicts piracy as an elaborate form of theater, with rich patrons hiring pirate crews to stage fake attacks on cruise ships for the sake of entertainment. Like One Piece, Bodacious Space Pirates is a fairly lighthearted adventure yarn that makes the most of the audience&#39;s expectations of pirate tropes. Notably, Bodacious Space Pirates features a strong female cast. All of this adds up to Bodacious Space Pirates being the best anime inspired by One Piece
