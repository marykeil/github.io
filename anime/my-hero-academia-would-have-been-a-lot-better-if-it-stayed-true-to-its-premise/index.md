## Literature Review

My Hero Academia could have been even better by staying true to its premise of a powerless Deku working to become a hero without a Quirk





Being able to overcome superpowered enemies through sheer hard work and determination could have been so much more conceptually interesting. There are so many other directions the series could have gone by focusing on a powerless Deku working to become a hero without a Quirk. He could have learned to fight with his wits rather than powers like Batman, or built a super-suit like Iron Man. He could even have taken on a role of the leader or tactician rather than the frontline fighter. Instead, with no foreshadowing or build-up whatsoever, not even three chapters in, the series walks back on the promise it had been making up to that point.





 Deku Should Have Remained Quirkless In My Hero Academia 
          

Suddenly, Deku is bequeathed All Might&#39;s One for All Quirk. While there is no denying that author Kohei Horikoshi built a captivating and entertaining saga from there, Deku gaining All for One is the least interesting direction My Hero Academia could have possibly taken. It feels like a betrayal of the premise that was established in the first chapters. It&#39;s the quickest, easiest, and cheapest possible way to resolve the issue of Deku not having a Quirk. A storyline that should have driven the entire series is anticlimactically discarded right away. Sure enough, Deku then has to learn how to properly use One for All, which also takes a huge toll on his body, but it&#39;s not the same as having to fight and survive without a superpower.

Deku gaining All for One may be conceptually boring and thematically inconsistent with the previous episodes, but at least he has to earn his new powers. It&#39;s not as interesting as Deku being powerless, but it is admittedly still in-character. His training with All Might and the gradual learning process of harnessing One for All without damaging himself does give the &#34;work hard, never give up&#34; aspect of his character a time to shine, but him getting a Quirk at all still feels completely out of left field after how much focus was given to him wanting to succeed as the one hero without a Quirk in the first chapters/episodes. The hard work theme, however, also disappear completely by the time Deku gets full mastery of One for All and awakens all the other Quirks contained in his incredible power.






 My Hero Academia Betrayed Its Initial Promise 
          

Deku going from the kid with no Quirk to wielding the most powerful Quirk feels like a betrayal of the promise established by the series. It&#39;s a testament to Horikoshi&#39;s storytelling abilities that he not only managed to still make My Hero Academia so interesting, but also kept developing Deku in a compelling character that remained inspiring despite immediately getting what he wanted. Even so, it&#39;s impossible to shake the feeling that the one simple choice of keeping Deku powerless could have created a much more interesting version of My Hero Academia.
