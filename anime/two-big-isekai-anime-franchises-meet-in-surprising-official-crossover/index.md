## Literature Review

Kadokawa gave anime fans a surprise Halloween treat with a short animation that brings the casts of Overlord and The Eminence in Shadow together.




October 31 gave a surprise treat for fans of the isekai genre, when Kadokawa released a short animation where the casts of Overlord and The Eminence in Shadow meet. The two shows, which already have super-deformed spin-offs, are a natural match. Perhaps more surprising is that the anime follows through on what was ostensibly an April Fool&#39;s joke made earlier this year.




Both stories have manga adaptations that appear in Kadokawa&#39;s Comp Ace magazine, which is how both casts were allowed to appear for this 10-minute short. Of course, Ainz Ooal Gown and Cid Kagenou both have many more similarities, which is likely why the April Fool&#39;s Joke that introduced the crossover eventually became a real animation.


 

Crossing that line might also mean further chances for the Eminence characters to appear in further comedy crossovers. Both Overlord and The Eminence in Shadow are among the best isekai anime streaming right now, so the crossover is a great treat for fans of the genre.

                  The Eminence in Shadow Proves its Hero&#39;s Depths With One Great Joke   The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 episode #1 has made its protagonist even better with one hilarious joke that implies a lot about his character.   





 April Fool&#39;s Gag Comes to Life In An Amusing Meeting of Edgelords 
          

The video, which is free to view on the Kadoakawa Anime Channel on YouTube, shows Cide and Ainz switching minds, and thus finding themselves dealing with their counterpart&#39;s group of lethal women, either the Pleiades or the Seven Shades. While the video isn&#39;t subtitled, the joke writes itself: both series involve main characters with mundane inner thoughts who act out roles of dark, mysterious masterminds, a role eagerly accepted by an inner circle who take names from the Greek Alphabet. Perhaps fittingly, both series have garnered a fanbase, with audiences delighting in the comedy of misunderstandings involving overpowered villain protagonists.

Officially, the super-deformed designs come from either anime&#39;s spin-offs, Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades and Kage-jitsu!, which are character-focused comedy shorts that are mostly an excuse to see the cast fool around. The crossover was originally teased in an April Fool&#39;s joke, which showed a &#34;fake&#34; poster for the crossover. At the time, the crossover, though amusingly appropriate, was considered just a pipe dream - the poster even had a supposed release date of &#34;April 2138&#34; to make it clear the project was not happening. Kadokawa obviously thought the joke was too good to pass up, however, leading to its official creation.




The crossover might lead to some interesting repercussions going forward. Overlord&#39;s characters have already been regularly used in several earlier comedy crossovers, particularly Isekai Quartet in 2019, which ran for two seasons. The Eminence in Shadow checks all the same boxes the prior crossover did, and with this April Fool&#39;s gag no longer a joke, there is nothing to really stop the characters from being further used. With any luck, this might mean more gag crossovers being made, with only the sky (and Kadokawa&#39;s portfolio) being the limit as to where Overlord and The Eminence in Shadow can appear next.
