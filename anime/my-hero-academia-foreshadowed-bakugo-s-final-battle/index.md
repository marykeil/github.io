## Literature Review

The matchups for the final battle are here, and Bakugo&#39;s has left fans stunned despite the series having hinted at his final battle multiple times.




Warning: Contains spoilers for chapter 405 of My Hero Academia!!




My Hero Academia has finally revealed what may be Bakugo&#39;s final battle in the series, and his opponent is none other than All For One. Unexpected as this matchup may seem given Bakugo&#39;s fatal condition a few chapters prior, this fateful battle may have been foreshadowed long ago and may mark the culmination of Bakugo&#39;s character arc and destiny.

Chapter 405 reveals that the damage to Bakugo&#39;s body has been successfully repaired, albeit at the cost of Edgeshot&#39;s life. Although Bakugo&#39;s condition is far from ideal, Edgeshot&#39;s sacrifice has allowed Bakugo to re-enter the battlefield and declare himself All for One&#39;s final opponent. Moreover, the chapter reveals a surprising connection to the second user of One For All, suggesting he may truly end up taking him down against all odds.

                  My Hero Academia Is Making A Huge Mistake In Saving All Might   My Hero Academia may have just ruined its final battle and Deku&#39;s character arc with one fell swoop by saving All Might.   





 Bakugo Mirrors The Second User, And Represents All For One&#39;s Worst Nightmare 
          

Chapter 405 of My Hero Academia all but confirms the parallels between Bakugo and the second user of One For All. All For One sees a glimpse of the second user when Bakugo attacks him in chapter 405, just as Shigaraki did in chapter 365 when he was intimidated by Bakugo, which was clearly one of All For One&#39;s memories. Furthermore, All For One seemed visibly disturbed and almost frustrated during his battle against the second user in chapter 369. This common frustration along with the peculiarly similar comments made by both Shigaraki and All For One in both these scenarios suggest All For One&#39;s biggest fear may actually be being defeated and humiliated by someone he considers insignificant like the second user or Bakugo, whom he has noticeably dismissed as a pawn to manipulate Deku throughout the series.




          

While fans have long speculated Bakugo&#39;s connection to the second user, with some suspecting he may even be a descendant, the latest chapter suggests Bakugo may instead simply carry on his will. Bakugo being the one to defeat All For One while Deku contends with Shigaraki makes perfect sense from a thematic standpoint, especially considering Bakugo&#39;s journey so far and how he himself has learned not to look down on his peers as insignificant &#39;extras&#39;. That said, defeating All For One will be no easy feat, particularly in Bakugo&#39;s current state, but he may be able to stall All For One long enough for Rewind to do the rest.

Nonetheless, My Hero Academia is quickly approaching its climax, all bets are off for the finale. The battle against All for One and Shigaraki has been a long and hard one and despite the heroes&#39; plans going awry in every way imaginable, and the winds of fate appear to be quite literally blowing in their favor, so perhaps Bakugo may eke out a victory against All For One as well.
