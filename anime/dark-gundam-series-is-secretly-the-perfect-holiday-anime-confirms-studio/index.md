## Literature Review

Despite its horrific, but necessary, depiction of war, Sunrise and Gundam fans still mirthfully consider War in the Pocket perfect for Christmas.




Christmas and mechs may not seem like a good match, but Sunrise, for a bit of holiday fun, announced that they&#39;ll be screening the 1989 OVA Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket in theaters on Christmas Eve. This, it seems, is unofficial confirmation that the tragic six-episode war story is perfect holiday material. The screenings also celebrate the 40-year anniversary of the distributor Emotion Label, Sunrise&#39;s sister company.




While not distinctly Christmas-themed, the OVAs take place during a space colony&#39;s holiday season. This was excuse enough for Sunrise and Emotion to announce the special screenings, as well as limited-time sales of 0080 figures this season. Regardless, War in the Pocket is an excellent and focused side story set during the Universal Century timeline that&#39;s lauded by fans, even now.

 War in the Pocket Is One of Gundam&#39;s Boldest And Darkest Stories 
Created by Studio Sunrise
         

Set during the same One-Year War as the original 1979 TV series, War in the Pocket follows a team of Zeon commandos who infiltrate a space colony to destroy the Gundam Alex. One child, Alfred Izuruha, enamored by the idea of &#34;cool&#34; war stories with giant robots, wishes to help â€“ only to realize too late it will lead to Bernard, the commando he&#39;s befriended, and Christina, the Gundam&#39;s pilot, fighting to the death. The OVA is also noteworthy for being the first Gundam to not be directed by franchise creator Yoshiyuki Tomino, with the responsibility handed to Fumihiko Takayama.




Distributor Emotion Label, which works alongside Sunrise under Bandai-Namco, hosted a special stream celebrating its 40-year anniversary, where it was revealed that all six episodes would be played at Shinjuku Piccadilly on December 24, following a ticket sale between 20 and 21. Furthermore, Gundam portal site Gundam.info reported that Gundam Base stores would be selling limited-edition figurines based on &#34;ad balloons&#34; that appeared in the OVA. Emotion&#39;s YouTube channel will also make the first episodes of select Gundam anime free to watch.

The Christmastime setting of War in the Pocket adds a bit of extra bite to its satire of Gundam&#39;s mobile suits, which have become a major source of merchandising despite its anti-war message. Alfred, a child eager to see robots duke it out, is a necessary allegory for fans more interested in Gundam&#39;s models. Nonetheless, between that and the memorable first battle that takes place in the frozen Arctic, it can be argued that there is enough snow and celebration to consider Mobile Suit Gundam 0800: War in the Pocket appropriate for Christmas, a notion that Sunrise cheekily agrees with.
