## Literature Review

Gojo Satoru&#39;s Limitless techniques know no bounds when used in conjunction with Six Eyes. Here&#39;s what the various stages of Gojo&#39;s Limitless entail.




Among the many formidable jujutsu sorcerers in the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, Satoru Gojo stands out as the indisputable master of the Limitless technique. Gojo is frequently considered Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest sorcerer, and a key part of that is his access to the ridiculously powerful Limitless technique.




Akin to the Six Eyes, Limitless is an inherited technique passed down within the Gojo family and works best in conjunction with the Six Eyes. Unlike other members of his clan, Gojo is an incredibly rare individual who was born with both Limitless and the Six Eyes, and his ability to use both abilities has given him the reputation of the strongest sorcerer in modern day.

          

Bringing the concept of infinity to reality, Limitless allows the user to distort and manipulate space at will, which proves to be an integral arsenal during fights against special-grade cursed spirits.

                  10 Best Gojo Quotes in Jujutsu Kaisen   Never at a loss for words, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Gojo had an exceptional gift of gab. It wasn&#39;t all braggadocio, though, much was quite profound.   





 Gojo&#39;s Limitless Makes Him Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Strongest Sorcerer 
          

Gojo explains the concept of Infinity by stating that a convergence of infinite series prevents an opponent from hitting him directly, as the blow ends up hitting infinity itself. This directly mirrors the Achilles Paradox, wherein the Greek hero is theoretically unable to catch a tortoise due to the infinite amounts of finite space separating the two. Limitless also makes any force attempting to penetrate infinity slows down to the point of halting in its entirety. Gojo is also able to wield the Cursed Technique Lapse, or Blue, and the Cursed Technique Reversal, or Red, which give him powerful ranged attacks.

Blue generates the power of attraction and cursed energy output; Gojo can use this to assault people with intense gravitational force, or he can use it on himself to move at super speed which, in turn, can make his physical attacks move fast enough to hit with incredible force. In contrast, Red allows him to reverse the effects and hit people with an intense force of repulsion, the effects of which are just as deadly. Blue and Red can also be combined into Hollow Purple, a massive blast of pure destructive energy that annihilates everything in its path, and it serves as Gojo&#39;s strongest regular technique in Jujutsu Kaisen.






 Gojo&#39;s Domain Expansion Explained 
          

Beyond the regular applications of Limitless, of course, is Gojo&#39;s Domain Expansion, Unlimited Void. Gojo&#39;s Domain Expansion assaults his opponents with unlimited knowledge that leaves them catatonic and allows Gojo to finish them off in an instant, and thanks to the Six Eyes reducing his cursed energy consumption to virtually nothing, Gojo is able to use Unlimited Void multiple times in a row before exhausting himself. Even with all that, Gojo still lost to Sukuna thanks to his utilization of Mahoraga, but his mastery of Limitless still served to make Gojo the strongest modern-day sorcerer in all of Jujutsu Kaisen.
