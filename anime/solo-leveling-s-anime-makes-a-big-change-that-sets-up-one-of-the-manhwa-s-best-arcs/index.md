## Literature Review

Solo Leveling makes one major change from the manhwa that teases the most crucial arcs of the series and sets the stage for Jinwoo&#39;s biggest feat.




Solo Leveling is quickly shaping up to be the biggest anime of 2024 with a hit pilot episode that also teases one of the manhwa&#39;s biggest arcs, among other surprises. While Jinwoo&#39;s journey towards becoming the strongest has only just begun, the anime has already paved the way for his most exciting battle yet, laying the groundwork for the Jeju Island Arc with its opening scene.




Episode #1 of Solo Leveling sets the stage for the highly anticipated Jeju Island Arc, with a flashback to the third Jeju Island Raid in the episode&#39;s opening scenes. Though a notable deviation from the manhwa, the Jeju Raid scene certainly helps establish the presence of the threat in advance while also functioning as an introduction to the peculiar world of Solo Leveling.

          

The flashback also features appearances from many prominent S-rank hunters, including Baek Yoonho, Eunseok, and Choi Jong-in, many of whom play a prominent role in the story going forward, giving fans of the manhwa a glimpse of their anime character designs and building excitement for their return to the story in the present timeline.

                  Solo Leveling Review: An Exciting Debut For 2024&#39;s Hottest Anime   Solo Leveling is one of the most hyped anime of 2024, and going off of the first two episodes, that level of excitement is more than warranted.   





 Solo Leveling Teases The Jeju Island Arc 
          

The Jeju Island Arc is without a doubt one of the best arcs in Solo Leveling and also one of the most crucial. Not only does the arc feature plenty of exciting action, but it also marks a turning point in Jinwoo&#39;s journey as he single-handedly wipes out the island and gains notoriety as a national hero. As the flashback in episode #1 establishes, these ants are far from weak, and Jinwoo&#39;s ability to finally defeat them after years of failed raids is certainly a massive feat.

The main highlight of the arc is, of course, Jinwoo&#39;s battle against Beru, the Ant King, who eventually grows to become quite a fan-favorite. The arc also promises many other significant developments, particularly a sizable addition to Jinwoo&#39;s shadow army. That said, considering the series has been slotted for only 12 episodes, it is unclear whether the current season will be able to cover the Jeju Island Arc, which takes place approximately 90 chapters into the manhwa. At the current rate of approximately 5 chapters adapted per episode, it appears the anime will most likely end with the Demon Castle Arc.




                  Solo Leveling Reveals First Opening Song And Worldwide Premieres&#39; Dates   The first opening of the highly anticipated Solo Leveling has been revealed, and it&#39;s a collaboration between top Japanese and Korean artists.   

Fortunately, even if the anime series is unable to cover the Jeju Island Arc, there is still the possibility of the arc being adapted into a movie instead, allowing for much better animation and an overall epic experience that does the arc justice. Either way, Solo Leveling&#39;s future as a franchise depends entirely on the anime&#39;s success, so only time will tell whether fans will ever get the chance to see the series&#39; biggest arc animated or not.
