## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen teases it may finally be bringing back its iconic brand of deadpan humor with this unexpected matchup.





Having largely abandoned its humor that originally drew fans to the series in favor of focusing on more dramatic, rather apocalyptic affairs since the Shibuya Incident, Jujutsu Kaisen has taken on a rather depressing tone, especially after Gojo&#39;s heartbreaking death, and fans have never felt the absence of the series&#39; lighthearted humor more strongly. Fortunately, Takaba&#39;s return may provide the much-needed comedic relief the series has been lacking.




                  10 Funniest Jujutsu Kaisen Moments   The funniest scenes in Jujutsu Kaisen offer a break from the show&#39;s serious plot and help to further characterize its cast in a short amount of time.    


 Takaba&#39;s Battle Against Kenjaku Promises Plenty of Entertainment 
          

Chapter #239 of Jujutsu Kaisen reveals Takaba has entered the battle against Kenjaku and his tomfoolery might just bring back the humor Jujutsu Kaisen has been missing as of late. Though Takaba is only a side character as he himself points out in the chapter, he may truly end up stealing the show while stalling Kenjaku. The fight already shows promise of being extremely entertaining with one of the series&#39; most meme-able faces yet and has been well-received by fans despite the expectations surrounding the battle against Sukuna. Takaba has managed to fly under the radar since his introduction, but upcoming chapters may finally reveal his true potential for both comedy and sorcery as well as whether a thousand years of living have given Kenjaku a sense of humor or not.




                  Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s True Villain Will Be Beaten By The Most Unexpected Hero   Kenjaku has been portrayed as something of an invincible villain in Jujutsu Kaisen, but chapter #239 sets him up to be defeated by an unexpected hero.   

Nonetheless, it&#39;s pleasant to see one of the series&#39; side characters get the rare opportunity to face one of the series&#39; final antagonists and while fans are apprehensive of Takaba&#39;s fate against Kenjaku, the comedian seems just as much if not more unaware of his own Cursed Technique and may end up surprising even himself. Takaba is one of the regular humans who were transformed into jujutsu sorcerers by Kenjaku during the Culling Game, and as such he is unaware of the full potential of his Cursed Technique. However, as Kenjaku&#39;s surprise in this chapter proves, Takaba&#39;s &#34;Comedian&#34; has the potential to turn the tables on Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s master villain.



 Comedy Has Become The Strongest Power In Manga 
          




Just like Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 in One Piece, Takaba&#39;s Comedian has the power to turn comedy into reality. When Takaba thinks of something he believes will be funny, that happens in the real world. Both broken powers come from a desire to add some levity to shonen fights that, according to Oda at least, have become too serious and dramatic. Jujutsu Kaisen has surely evoked strong emotions from fans and fellow creators alike with recent events and Takaba&#39;s entrance offers the perfect chance for a nice change of pace after the overwhelmingly tragic tone of the series over the last few chapters.
