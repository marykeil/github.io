## Literature Review

My Hero Academia reveals the release date for Season 7, alongside an enthralling trailer that hints this season could be the last.




My Hero Academia has revealed the release of the seventh season of its anime during Jump Festa 20224, alongside an exciting new trailer and a key visual. The anime is nearing its climax as the series edges ever closer to its final battle between the heroes and villains, which will conclude one of the most iconic anime of all time.




The release window was officially confirmed on December 10, 2023, following a leak that circulated online. Although it was revealed that the anime would be coming out in Spring 2024, a more specific release date was announced during the My Hero Academia panel at Jump Festa 2024.


 

As per the official X account of the anime, season 7 of My Hero Academia will be released on May 4, 2024, streaming on Crunchyroll. From the images shown in the trailer, this season will also cover the epic final battle between the heroes and the villains, currently developing in the manga.

                  Suicide Squad, One Piece, &amp; Solo Leveling: 2024&#39;s 10 Most Anticipated Anime   2024 promsies a robust catalogue of brand new anime to keep fans&#39; watch-lists full during the new year, including highly anticipated titles.   





 The End Is Near For My Hero Academia 

 

The trailer is filled with many bombshells. After an intense war between the heroes and the Paranormal Liberation Army, the League of Villains and All for One are ready to make their final move and destroy hero society once and for all. Judging from the trailer, this season will not only cover the epic battle between Shigaraki and Star And Stripe, and the &#34;U.A. Traitor&#34; arc, but also the final war between the heroes and the villains.

The season will most likely be split into 2 cours with 24 episodes in total, based on previous seasons. Considering how the anime faithfully adapts the source material, the first 12 episodes will focus on the Star and Stripe arc, with All Might&#39;s friend from the US taking the lead. Her main goal is to stop Shigaraki before he is fully awakened, and All For One aims to steal Star and Stripes&#39; quirk. The second half will then cover the U.A Traitor arc, which will be about a mole planted by All For One in U.A Academy to supply him with information about Midoriya, the wielder of All For One&#39;s most desired quirk.




          

However, the trailer also shows scenes from the Final War - specifically the villains teleporting to the battlefield using the Warping Quirk - that fans of the manga have seen developing in the pages of My Hero Academia over the past year. This could mean that Season 7 will end with the start of that battle with an incredible cliffhanger, but also that this could be the final season of My Hero Academia. 2024 is shaping up to be quite the year for anime fans, with the fourth My Hero Academia also set to come to theaters next year.

The My Hero Academia anime has been entertaining fans for the past eight years, and promises to continue doing so as it concludes its exciting story with a spectacular season 7.
