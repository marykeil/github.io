## Literature Review

The studio behind Netflix&#39;s new The One Piece anime has previously used AI, and some fans are worried the controversial tool will be used again.




The news that Netflix&#39;s and Wit Studios&#39; modern anime adaptation The One Piece would be using &#34;cutting-edge visual technology&#34; has some fans worried that the modernized series could use AI. Using artificial intelligence to create art has become a controversial topic that instantly raises a red flag for many viewers due to the tool&#39;s potential to take away jobs from human animators. A past project tied to Wit Studios&#39; raised concerns that the new anime adaptation of Eiichiro Oda&#39;s beloved series may use AI in its creation.




Although there is already a popular anime adaptation of One Piece, it&#39;s been ongoing since 1999 and has more than 1088 episodes. That intimidating length has driven away some people curious to dive into the celebrated epic&#39;s depths. At the same time, animation has come a long way since the late 90s, and modern techniques should help The One Piece appeal to newer audiences. Still, if AI is used in its creation, it may drive some of them away.


 

The official announcement from Netflix states, &#34;...the committee aims to provide viewers with a fresh yet familiar experience, utilizing cutting-edge visual technology to reimagine Luffy&#39;s adventures...&#34; The statement likely refers to features the 1999 One Piece anime was not created with, like an HD format, 16:9 aspect ratio, and CGI-assisted animation. Still, that hasn&#39;t stopped certain X users like shabboo3 from assuming the statement is referring to AI.





 Wit Studios Has Previously Used AI In A Short Film 

 

The use of AI for The One Piece anime has yet to be confirmed. While the reveal of the modernized series was mostly met with excitement, others took the line referring to &#34;cutting-edge visual technology&#34; and assumed Wit&#39;s upcoming adaptation of one of the world&#39;s most beloved franchises would be primarily made using AI artwork. At the same time, the concern is not entirely unfounded because the studio has previously used AI in a 2023 short film. Still, the controversial tool was not used for the creation of the entire animated project.


 




An experimental three-minute short film titled The Dog &amp; The Boy used AI to help create stylish backgrounds. However, much of the project was still made by human animators. The Netflix anime project was developed jointly by Base x Rinna Co., Ltd., a technology developer, and WIT Studios. A breakdown of the animation showed detailed drawings created for the short before and after AI was used to add extra details and backgrounds. Still, with WIT Studio&#39;s name attached to the emotional short film, it is more than enough for some internet users to conclude that The One Piece will be made using AI.



Wit Studio&#39;s previous anime credits include Attack on Titan (Seasons 1 - 3), Spy X Family, Vinland Saga, and Ranking of Kings.






 It&#39;s Possible To Use AI Ethically In Art Creation 

 




Despite the negative connotations around using artificial intelligence in creating art, it&#39;s a tool that has its benefits when used ethically. Using AI indeed has the potential to take away jobs from people deserving of the work, which some employers have and will abuse. However, AI can also be used to complete time-consuming, mind-numbing tasks viewers may not consider in the art creation process. More details about the upcoming Netflix adaptation and if and how AI will play a part in its creation are desired. At the end of the day, passionate One Piece fans hope for a new series that will do the story justice with beautiful animation showcasing human animators&#39; talents.

The One Piece will be releasing on Netflix maybe in 2024.
