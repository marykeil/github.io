# My Hero Academia s Villains Are Only Successful Because of One Hero


## SUMMARY 



  Ragdoll&#39;s Search Quirk gave All for One the ability to track and defeat heroes by learning their weaknesses, radically changing the outcome of later arcs.   Acquiring Ragdoll&#39;s Quirk was one of All for One&#39;s strongest strategic moves, allowing him to disrupt battles and evade capture.   The heroes&#39; inability to protect Ragdoll allowed All for One to successfully steal her Quirk, shaping the plot of My Hero Academia and showcasing the danger of noncombat Quirks.

## Literature Review

It&#39;s only thanks to one hero&#39;s Quirk that My Hero Academia&#39;s villains have become so dangerous, but there was nothing the heroes could do to stop it.




The power of one My Hero Academia pro has gone on to become one of the villains&#39; most valuable abilities, and their acquisition of this skill radically changed the outcome of many later arcs as a result.




During the Forest Training Camp arc, the villains actually had two objectives: one was to kidnap Bakugo, in hopes that they might convince him to become a villain, and the second was to kidnap the Pro Hero known as Ragdoll. Ragdoll possessed the Search Quirk, which allowed her to detect as many as 100 different people, as well as their locations and weaknesses, from many miles away. During the incident at the training camp, Ragdoll used this Quirk to help keep track of the students... until she was rendered unconscious and taken to All for One&#39;s base, where he proceeded to steal her Quirk for himself.


 Ragdoll&#39;s Search Quirk Changed the Game for All for One 
          

All for One had apparently had his eye on this Quirk for quite some time, but he had good reason to wait. The Quirk not only tracks people, but it stores data on the people it has tracked in the past, making it trivially easy to track them again. By waiting until the training camp, All for One got the Quirk pre-programmed to track every student in Class 1-A and 1-B, as well as all their teachers. Ragdoll presumably had data on hundreds of other people as well, likely including many pros who she&#39;d worked with in the past. With this Quirk, it would not only be easy for All for One to evade the heroes looking for him, but to outright defeat them by learning their weaknesses.




It was actually because of this stolen Search Quirk that Midoriya had to leave UA during the Dark Deku arc. All for One was undoubtedly using the Quirk to track Midoriya&#39;s location, so he needed to stay on the move in order to avoid drawing trouble to any one location. The Search Quirk was even deployed during the Final War arc, allowing All for One to home in on Shigaraki and Deku&#39;s battle and speed off in that direction to disrupt it. Acquiring this Quirk from Ragdoll was one of All for One&#39;s strongest strategic moves, and he knew exactly how best to put this Quirk to work.

Unfortunately, the heroes at the time of the Forest Training Camp arc had no way of knowing that Ragdoll was a target, and were thus unable to protect her in any meaningful way. While they were able to deduce that the students (or at least some of them) were targets, Ragdoll simply disappeared, and was only later recovered around the same time as Bakugo was. Had Ragdoll managed to avoid capture somehow, events from this point forward would&#39;ve unfolded radically differently. My Hero Academia&#39;s plot was surprisingly shaped by this one stolen Quirk, proving just how dangerous All for One can be even with noncombat Quirks.
