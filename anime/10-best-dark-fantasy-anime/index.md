## Literature Review

Even when set in magical worlds of angels and demons, the best dark fantasy anime stay grounded, realistically depicting nightmares and horrors.





While some fans may look to the fantasy genre hoping to find interesting worlds that they would like to live in, others prefer the intricate and depressing worlds of dark fantasy, wherein survival is seldom guaranteed and the worst horrors of humanity are revealed. The best dark fantasy anime do not shy away from subjecting their characters to tragedies and traumatic events, instead asking how such events can affect them.









 








 10  Drifters 
        

An isekai with a unique premise, Drifters follows three important historical figures as they are summoned to a different world to fight against the &#34;Ends&#34;, other historical figures whose tragic lives caused them to reincarnate as twisted versions of their former selves, furthermore possessing strange new supernatural abilities. Though all three are great warriors known as some of the strongest of their respective time periods, that doesn&#39;t necessarily translate into an easy victory when fighting in an unknown world of magic. The cruelty and brutality of the fights they participate in are clear to see, proving that this is not a typical case of an overpowered isekai protagonist taking it easy.





 9  Claymore 
        

Not too dissimilar from other dark fantasy anime, the story of Claymore&#39;s protagonist Clare is one of loss and revenge. After her family is attacked by youma, mysterious flesh-eating demons, and she herself becomes subject to abuse and trauma caused by the demons, she is finally rescued only to once again lose everything she held dear. This is when she decides to become a Claymore and start fighting back, driven by nothing but pain and a thirst for power. The world she lives in is a dangerous and gruesome one, where tragedy and massacre are all but guaranteed, and even the strongest are never truly safe.





 8  Hellsing Ultimate 
        

As more of an urban fantasy than anything, Hellsing Ultimate&#39;s world may not be as fantastical as others, but it is still absolutely defined by its supernatural elements and dark ambiance. The titular Hellsing is a secret organization working to keep ordinary people safe from fearsome creatures, and the protagonist is Alucard is their strongest ally, an impossibly powerful vampire seeking out and taking down other vampires who pose a threat to society. Alucard&#39;s methods are brutal and ruthless, and, while not everyone may appreciate the excessive gore of the show, those looking for dark and grimy action are sure to enjoy the bloodbath.





 7  The Promised Neverland 
        

Similarly to other anime shows that like to subvert expectations with surprising episode 1 reveals, The Promised Neverland starts out by presenting viewers with the image of a seemingly peaceful orphanage, where kids see each other and their loving caretaker Isabella as a family, living comfortable lives, learning, and playing freely, only for this image to soon be shattered. Once they learn that the supposed adoptions that were happening regularly were actually times when kids were sold to man-eating demons, they decide to find a way to escape their fate, even without the assurance that there is any safety in this dark fantastical world for them.





 6  Overlord 
        

Though Overlord&#39;s stakes may not seem to be as high as those of other dark fantasy anime, given that the events take place in the world of video game, this world is completely real and serious to its inhabitants, including Ainz Ooal Gown, a former player who was somehow trapped here on the day of the VRMMO&#39;s shutdown. Now having to live as the most powerful mage skeleton, commanding various fearsome minions, he has no choice but to act the part and play the role of the ruthless villain. As great of a dark fantasy as this series may be, it also differentiates itself from others with occasional moments of comedic relief.





 5  Castlevania 
        

Though Castlevania&#39;s status as an anime may be up for debate, its quality as a dark fantasy work is anything but. Inspired by the beloved classic video game franchise whose name it bears, Castlevania follows members of the Belmont family and Alucard as they fight against Dracula and his minions, in an attempt to defend the nation of Wallachia. Boasting an intricate, dark story, with the foundation of which many viewers may already be familiar, as well as an impressive art style reminiscent of typical anime, this series is not only a must-watch for fans of the video games, but also genuinely enjoyable for any fans of the subgenre.
            
 
 How Castlevania: Nocturne Is Connected To Castlevania 
Castlevania: Nocturne continues Netflix’s adaptation of the video game series. Here’s how Richter’s story ties into the previous show, Castlevania.








 4  Made in Abyss 
        

Though Made in Abyss starts out rather innocent, presenting itself as a mysterious fantastical world waiting to be explored, it gradually reveals itself to be much darker and gruesome than unsuspecting viewers may expect. The titular Abyss refers to a massive, largely unexplored chasm, wherein strange creatures roam freely and relics of long-lost civilizations await. Riko, an orphan aspiring Diver, and Reg, a robot with unknown origins, team up and choose to brave the depths of the Abyss together, each for their own reasons, but nothing could possibly prepare them or the viewers watching their journey for the events that are to unfold.





 3  Fate/Zero 
        

Fate/Zero follows the events surrounding the Fourth Holy Grail War, the winner of which is said to be granted any wish, no matter how impossible. In accordance with the potential gains, this war is also terribly dangerous, with the survival of its participants being far from guaranteed. There are seven participants in this cutthroat game, each commanding a different powerful familiar, with origins typically inspired by real-life history. Though they all have their own unique situations and desires, none is willing to give up easily, making their battles truly tense and epic, with shocking violence being all but guaranteed, always keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.





 2  Dorohedoro 
        

While most magical worlds tend to be on the bright and positive side, seemingly inviting viewers to imagine the possibility of living a life enhanced by the capabilities of sorcery, Dorohedoro is completely different in that regard. Here, ordinary humans without magic are not only shunned by sorcerers, but also used in experiments by them and even killed, despite living separately, in a depressing and merciless place known as the &#34;Hole&#34;. Moreover, even magic users live dangerous lives, as their own place of residence is just as lawless. No matter how strong, no one can ever truly be safe in the dark fantasy world of Dorohedoro.





 1  Berserk 
        

No list of dark fantasy anime would be complete without including Berserk, one of the most influential dark fantasy works ever created. Berserk&#39;s world shows no hesitation in proving how dark it can be, with abuse and massacre being the order of the day. Yet it is also intricate and thoroughly fantastic, with elves and demons being likewise commonplace. Guts&#39; journey is fraught with trauma, tragedy, and betrayal, with him and his loved ones being subject to profound psychological horror. Truly, there is no story quite as emblematic of the dark fantasy subgenre as that of the Black Swordsman, and that&#39;s exactly what makes it one of the best. While the 1997 Berserk anime does end on a massive cliffhanger, it still hasn&#39;t been topped as the greatest dark fantasy anime.
Dark anime shows come in various forms, but the fantastical ones are often the most intriguing and captivating, as their settings enable them to tell unique stories that couldn&#39;t be told otherwise. Even in a subgenre such as this, there can still be significant variety, with some series being darker in terms of their action and brutality of their scenes, while others emphasize the cruelty and tragedy of their stories instead, even when their visuals may subvert expectations. For viewers looking for maturity, gore, and overall realistic struggles, dark fantasy anime are the ones to watch.
