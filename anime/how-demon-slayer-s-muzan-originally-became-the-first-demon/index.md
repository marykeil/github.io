Muzan creates other demons by giving his blood to humans, transforming them and granting incredible powers, but those who can&#39;t handle the mutation die.   Muzan&#39;s ultimate goal is to find the Blue Spider Lily, a rare flower that caused his accidental transformation into a demon, in order to regain his ability to tolerate sunlight and eliminate his weakness.

## Literature Review

The one known as Muzan Kibutsuji is the progenitor of all the demons in Demon Slayer, but how did he end up as a demon in the first place?




Warning: Contains Spoilers for Demon Slayer&#39;s MangaThe big villain of Demon Slayer, Muzan Kibutsuji, isn&#39;t just the mastermind behind a lot of the plots that the heroes try to stop; he&#39;s also literally the origin of nearly every demon they encounter, as a result of his ability to create more demons. But if Muzan created all the other demons that are shown in the series, who created Muzan?




Though Demon Slayer is set in the early 20th century, Muzan has been shown alive in flashbacks as far back as 1,000 years ago. He creates other demons by giving his blood to humans, causing them to transform and gain incredible powers--provided they can handle the mutations.

          

If they can&#39;t, their body will simply be reduced to a pile of goo before turning to dust. Muzan extends a surprising amount of control over those who he has transformed, able to kill them with ease simply for things like speaking his name.

 Demon Slayer&#39;s Muzan Became a Demon On Accident 
          




In chapter 127 of the Demon Slayer manga, it&#39;s revealed that Muzan wasn&#39;t always a demon, but he was always a pretty bad guy. Like most other demons, Muzan started out as a human, but since he was the first, there wasn&#39;t simply a demon who could give him blood and cause him to transform. Muzan&#39;s transformation into a demon was actually a complete accident. In the early 900s, 1,000 years before the story, the human Muzan was dying of an unspecified illness and decided to undergo an experimental treatment in an attempt to save his life.

The experimental medicine was made out of a flower known as a Blue Spider Lily, a rare plant that&#39;s scarcely more than a myth. While the medicine seemed to heal him, he was unable to go back out into the sunlight again and began exhibiting other signs of being a demon. In a rage, Muzan killed the doctor who created the original medicine but was left with no way to tolerate sunlight as a result.

Since then, Muzan has attempted to do two things. The first was to create more demons by sharing his blood, in the hopes that one of them would mutate in such a way as to be able to withstand sunlight, allowing him to learn the secret from them. The other was to search out the Blue Spider Lily, in hopes of recreating the original serum which transformed him and possibly regain his ability to go out into the sunlight. This is also why Muzan is shown to have an interest in chemistry and science at various points throughout the manga--he&#39;s spent the past 1,000 years learning anything that might help him to overcome this weakness.

Despite all of this, Muzan doesn&#39;t want to go back to being one of Demon Slayer&#39;s humans; having already once lived with the specter of death hovering over him, he refuses to do so again, instead questing to remain immortal by eliminating his one significant weakness.

Muzan&#39;s motivations and backstory are more complex than one might expect from a villain who is so cold and cruel, but that&#39;s Demon Slayer. The ultimate irony is that the Blue Spider Lily only blooms in the day, and even then very rarely, so no matter how many thousands of years Muzan looked, he never would have been able to find it in Demon Slayer.
