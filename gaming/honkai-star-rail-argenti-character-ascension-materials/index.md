## Literature Review

You will need to farm the proper materials to Ascend Argenti and level his abilities in Honkai: Star Rail. Here’s what they are and how to get them.





In battle, Argenti uses Physical DMG. Along with Huohuo and Hanya, Argenti is one of the new characters that were announced during the Honkai: Star Rail 1.5 livestream. This playable hero is only obtainable whenever his banner is featured in the gacha system. If you are lucky enough to beat the odds and pull Argenti, however, you will need to work to fully Ascend him and level his abilities. In addition to his character build, this task will make him a much more effective character in combat, as his damage output will be boosted, as well as his chances of surviving tough encounters.




                  Honkai: Star Rail Warp Drop Rates &amp; Pity System Explained   HoYoverse’s new RPG, Honkai: Star Rail, is a gacha game that requires players to pull from banners. Here are the odds and pity system explained.   


 Ascension Materials To Farm For Argenti In Honkai: Star Rail 
         

According to Honey Hunter World, the first set of materials needed for Argenti’s character Ascension is Extinguished Core, Glimmering Core, and Squirming Core. These materials make up an item family and are easily farmable from some of the most basic and easily accessible opponents in the game. They normally drop from elemental spawn creatures in Honkai: Star Rail. The best way to farm these Cores is by fighting Windspawn, Thunderspawn, Frostspawn, Flamespawn, Blaze Out of Space, Ice Out of Space, and Mask of No Thought. As pointed out by Game8, a prime location to farm Cores is in the Backwater Pass and Rivet Town maps on Jarilo-VI.






As Ascension levels get higher, rarer materials will be needed. As such, you should use the Synthesizer to transform Extinguished Cores into Glimmering Cores, and then Glimmering Cores into Squirming Cores.




You will need a large number of these Cores, as they are needed not only in the Ascension process but are also required to level up Argenti’s Traces. The next important set of materials needed for Argenti’s Ascension is called Netherworld Pass in Honkai: Star Rail. This item drops exclusively from the Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Perdition, added to the Fyxestroll Garden map on Xianzhou Luofu with Version 1.5. This means that this item could not be pre-farmed prior to the update’s release. You will have to challenge the Stagnant Shadow a few times in order to obtain the required amount for all of his Ascension stages.

The table below lists all the materials needed for Argenti’s complete Ascension in Honkai: Star Rail:

 Argenti Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Honkai: Star Rail   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    5x Extinguished Core   4,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 30 Ascension    10x Extinguished Core   8,000x Credits     -   Level 40 Ascension    6x Glimmering Core   3x Netherworld Pass   16,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 50 Ascension    9x Glimmering Core   7x Netherworld Pass   40,000x Credits     -   Level 60 Ascension    6x Squirming Core   20x Netherworld Pass   80,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 70 Ascension    9x Squirming Core   35x Netherworld Pass   160,000x Credits     -   Total Materials    15x Extinguished Core   15x Glimmering Core   15x Squirming Core   65x Netherworld Pass   308,000x Credits       3x Star Rail Pass      






To pay for the various rounds of the Ascension process itself, you will need to invest a total of 308,000x Credits in Honkai: Star Rail. This sum does not include the extra 580,100x Credits consumed if you utilize Character EXP Materials to level Argenti up through the Ascension thresholds – of course, you can level up Argenti by facing opponents, but that can take a long and unreasonable time. Ascending and leveling Argenti is both a time-consuming and costly task, but crucial if your goal is to unlock the Physical DPS’ hero’s full potential.



In case you are in need of more Credits, you should use Trailblaze Power to challenge Calyx (Golden): Bud of Treasure.






 Materials For Argenti’s Traces (Abilities) In Honkai: Star Rail 
          




While Ascending and leveling can be expensive, the hardest part is upgrading all of Argenti’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail. As was previously mentioned, Extinguished, Glimmering, and Squirming Cores are all needed for Argenti’s Talents and, in comparison, a lot more is needed here than for his Ascension process. These items can be obtained from all the aforementioned sources. A few can also be purchased every month from the Embers Exchange shop, though it is best to only do this if you need a very small amount and are unable or unwilling to farm targets across Jarilo-VI maps.

The second set of items needed for Argenti’s Traces are exclusive to Erudition characters. Key of Inspiration, Key of Knowledge, and Key of Wisdom are required in large numbers to fuel all of Argenti’s abilities. Though they can be obtained through other means, such as monthly purchases at the Embers Exchange store, the best way to farm Keys in Honkai: Star Rail is to challenge Calyx (Crimson): Bud of Erudition. This domain will need to be faced several times, as the Trace-leveling process is demanding. Like the Cores, Keys are a part of an item family and need to be evolved using the Synthesizer as the need changes.




As you progress further into Argenti’s Traces, you will also be required to use two rarer items. The first of them is Regret of Infinite Ochema. This item can be farmed from the weekly boss Phantylia in Honkai: Star Rail, though you will need to face her several times. There is also a weekly limit on these types of bosses, so farming the material to fully level all of Argenti’s abilities can take some time. The other important item for higher levels is Tracks of Destiny, which can be gathered from the Nameless Honor battle pass, Simulated Universe, and as rewards from limited-time events.

The table below lists all the materials you will need for Argenti’s abilities:

 Argenti Trace Materials In Honkai: Star Rail   Extinguished Core    41x      Glimmering Core    56x      Squirming Core    58x      Key of Inspiration    18x      Key of Knowledge    69x      Key of Wisdom    139x      Regret of Infinite Ochema    12x      Tracks of Destiny    8x      Credit    3,000,000x      






You will also need a fair share of Credits to get Argenti’s Traces up to the maximum level. Fully leveling and Ascending the 5-star character is a time-consuming endeavor, as well as a costly one, but it is the first step in optimizing the hero’s abilities. Of course, later on, you will need to build Argenti in Honkai: Star Rail, but this is what will unlock his powers and allow his abilities to be enhanced.
