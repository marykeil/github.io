# Forget Pokémon Black &amp; White Remakes, There s Another We Need First


## SUMMARY 



  The next Pokémon remakes are assumed to be the Generation 5 games, Black and White.   However, Pokémon Emerald deserves a remake, even if the series has abandoned its third versions.   There is precedent for self-contained remakes, like Let&#39;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#39;s Go, Eevee!, and Emerald&#39;s sprite artwork provides an opportunity for a completely new remake style.

## Literature Review

While most Pokémon fans are looking to the fifth generation of games for the next remake, there&#39;s another classic that should get a remake first.




Although Pokémon Black and White seem like prime candidates for the next remakes in the Pokémon franchise, there&#39;s one classic game that could use the remake treatment first - Pokémon Emerald. Despite the fact that the series has essentially abandoned the idea of releasing third, more definitive versions of each generation&#39;s games, replacing them with DLC expansions, there are still plenty of ideas from the original Pokémon Emerald on the Game Boy Advance that would get a better chance to shine in an all-new remake. And, while remakes of the third generation already exist in the form of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, another remake for Hoenn could take on a significantly different style.




Starting with FireRed and LeafGreen in the third mainline generation, Pokémon has been steadily remaking old games in the series, bringing the series&#39; modern systems and Pokémon to older regions, with the most recently released being Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, remakes of the fourth-generation Sinnoh games. However, while fan expectations and new leaks point towards Gen 5 Pokémon remakes, there&#39;s still room to revisit older games - especially with a different style from the usual remakes that the Pokémon series usually gets.

 Pokémon Emerald Deserves A Remake 
          

While Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, released on the 3DS, serve as remakes for the third generation, a Reddit post by KyonC137 shows how the game could look re-imagined in an isometric perspective. Although remakes of older generation Pokémon games now usually transition the games&#39; visuals to 3D, matching the style of newer generations, an isometric view could represent an opportunity to return to a more nostalgic, sprite-based art style, more closely matching the visuals of the classic games while still adding something new.






 Is An Isometric Pokémon Emerald Remake Possible? 
          

An isometric perspective would bring with it some notable limitations. Most importantly, the Pokédex of an isometric remake of Emerald would likely need to have an even more limited selection of Pokémon than current games, as instead of reusing 3D models, the game would have to have all-new sprites made for each individual Pokémon. Fortunately, remakes with extremely limited selections of Pokémon and differing art styles already exist in the form of Let&#39;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#39;s Go, Eevee!, so there is precedent for more self-contained, experimental remakes. And, as some fans of the franchise prefer 2D sprites to the current 3D models, a remake of Emerald in an isometric style could be especially pleasing to older fans.





 

So, although the next Pokémon remakes are likely for Gen 5, there&#39;s still plenty of reason to take another look at earlier generations as well, and take the chance to experiment and break away from the usual remake formula. A new Emerald remake in an isometric style could have significantly different offerings than ORAS, especially on the improved hardware of the Switch, and could potentially be a massive success for Pokémon.
