## Literature Review

The remake of the Super Mario RPG is pretty close to the original, but there are still several changes and updates that have been made to it.




The remake of the Super Mario RPG is a good balance in keeping the foundation of everything that made the game special and unique, while still making some big changes to improve the mechanics, gameplay, and graphics. The original Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars was released in March 1996 for the SNES and now has been recreated for the Nintendo Switch for everyone to be able to revisit - or be introduced to - Mario&#39;s first questing adventure. Although the story has remained faithful to the original, several tweaks and added features have improved the quality-of-life experience of the game for the Switch.
Mario and his friends embark to repair the Star Road and defeat the Smithy Gang in Super Mario RPG, and this unique adventure for the Super Mario characters is a vastly different style of game than the traditional platformers that came before it. The story-rich RPG has been a favorite for many since it debuted in 1996, which meant that for a remake to be successful, many things needed to remain true to the original. Below are ten of the biggest changes that were made in this modern remake of Super Mario RPG for the Nintendo Switch.

 10  Some Character Names Have Changed 
Princess Toadstool Is Officially Princess Peach
        

At the time that Super Mario RPG came out for the SNES, Princess Peach was known as Princess Toadstool. Now, very few would recognize her by that moniker. Therefore, it makes sense that for the remake, she has been officially renamed to Princess Peach.
Several other characters also received new names for this edition of the game, such as Yaridovich becoming the awkwardly-sounding Speardovich, and Mack becoming Claymorton. Perhaps the most disappointing of all is the rebranding that Frogfucius has undergone to become the much more boring Frog Sage.

There are five playable characters in Super Mario RPG. They all have their strengths, but some are just better overall. Here are the rankings.








 9  Graphics Have Been Updated 
From SNES&#39; 16-Bit To The Switch&#39;s Fully Rendered 3D


 







The most obvious and necessary change in the remake of Super Mario RPG was the overall look of the game. Although the SNES creation was impressive for its day, the Nintendo Switch has been able to take that attempted 3D art and make it much smoother and more visually appealing. The look continues to capture the feel of the first game while offering a much brighter and more detailed style.





 8  Super Mario RPG Remake Added A Journal 
Monster List, Sound Player, &amp; More
        

A very helpful addition to the remake of Super Mario RPG is the Journal tab. This includes a useful Monster List bestiary, a Scrapbook with entries from party characters, a Sound Player to listen to original and newly-arranged music, and a Play Report that gives gold medals for breaking records in mini-games.
The information in the Monster List could be particularly helpful, as it will list the following information for each monster:
 HP 
 Experience 
 Weak Elements 
 Weak Statuses 
 Drops and Rare Drops 
 Location Found 
 Times Defeated 
 Thought Peek Text 
 Fun Facts 

To get the monsters to show up in this bestiary and have it fully filled out, players must use Mallow&#39;s Thought Peek skill on them. 






 7  Hidden Treasures Are No Longer Permanently Missed 
Missed Treasure Can Be Returned To
        

One common frustration about the original Super Mario RPG was that for completionists who wanted to get every Hidden Treasure, it was easy to permanently miss some. At least one, inside the Mushroom Kingdom Castle, which would have been gone forever if not found at the right time, can now be accessed at any point in the game. There will be some Toads that may have to have their heads jumped on to reach it, however.





 6  Gold Coin Storage Is Increased 
Purchasing Expensive Items Is Easier
        

Mario can now have more money in his pockets to buy items in Super Mario RPG&#39;s remake. In the SNES version of the game, the maximum limit of coins was 999, which has now been raised to 9,999 gold coins that can be carried at any time. This means that Mario and his friends can much more easily purchase items such as Fireworks that can cost 500 coins at once.





 5  Combat Is Better In Super Mario RPG Remake 
Triple Moves, Action Gauge, &amp; Chained Attack Buffs


 







Having different parties of characters in Super Mario RPG gives opportunities for different combination moves based on the selected characters. Once the Action Gauge reaches 100%, the three party members can combine to use a Triple Move that is different for each trio, and features impressive animations as well as effects. Additionally, the Action Gauge can help signify Chained Attack buffs, which will also vary depending on the party members included.

 4  Difficulty Settings &amp; Action Prompts 
Normal Or Breezy Mode


 







Whether to be able to more easily focus on the story without as much of a challenge, or simply to make the game more accessible for those who may struggle with difficult situations in Mario&#39;s adventure, the remake of Super Mario RPG now has two difficulty settings. The Breezy Mode is an easier way to play the game, with less challenging battles, quicker level advancement, and better Attack Action Commands. Additionally, while Action Commands were in the original Super Mario RPG, it could be hard to get the timing right and easily became frustrating. For the Nintendo Switch, this is now more obvious with an exclamation mark prompt shown to guide the player on when to press the button.





 3  Item Storage Feature Has Been Added 
Storage Box In Mario&#39;s Home
        

One simple, but very appreciated, quality-of-life improvement for Super Mario RPG&#39;s remake on the Switch is the addition of Mario&#39;s home Storage. With this basic chest, when the carry limit has been exceeded, items will be stored for later retrieval. The Storage Box receives items automatically after the limit has been reached, making it easy for Mario to travel back to his house and get things if needed, without them being lost forever.
Breezy Mode allows players to carry more items than Normal Mode. 






 2  Autosave 
No More Lost Progress
        

The Switch remake of Super Mario RPG has an autosave feature built in that will save the game every time the characters enter a new room or area. There are still Save Blocks located in the world which are recommended to use as well, but the autosave will help to prevent any disappointing losses of data in the event of an unforeseen circumstance. There is no way to turn off the autosave setting, but players can delete saves if needed.





 1  Fast Travel Saves Time &amp; Energy 
Unlock Teleport


 







The most useful and appreciated change in the Super Mario RPG remake for the Nintendo Switch is the added ability to Fast Travel. This handy feature isn&#39;t immediately unlocked, but once it is available, it makes it much simpler to explore the world in this adventure, which requires some Regions to be visited multiple times. Players can not only select locations on the map to visit, but some dungeons or mini-game locations can provide teleport options within that location.
