## Literature Review

Wordle, the popular word-guessing game hosted by The New York Times, has over 1,700 words remaining as possible solutions. 





Wordle started on June 19, 2021, with a listed 2,315 possible solutions. When The New York Times purchased Wordle in 2022, six words were removed from this list: agora, pupal, lynch, fibre, slave, and wench. When players connect to the Wordle site, their browser downloads a script that stores all past answers and future, unused Wordle words.

The New York Times offers players a new five-letter word from the list of unused Wordle words above to guess each day, never repeating words, so there is a finite list of words left to be played. There are many strategies players use to guess the daily word whether it&#39;s choosing the best Wordle starter words, eliminating vowels first, or knowing the statistics of letters. Players are given six chances to guess the word, being notified of correct letters and correct letter placement each turn.



Having trouble winning even though you are using an unused Wordle word to start every time? Check out this video from BuzzFeed Multiplayer, which shows some handy methods for never losing at Wordle!

 
 




As of right now, the script allows for over 1,700 more days of its famous five-letter puzzles, keeping Wordle a popular puzzle game for at least five more years. No matter what strategy players use, now they at least have a reference for which possible words Wordle may use next. With almost 9,000 possible five-letter words according to The Scrabble Dictionary, it is very possible that Wordle will add even more to its vocabulary over time.

               Wordle   Released:   2021-10-01    Developer(s):   Josh Wardle    Genre(s):   Puzzle    Platform(s):   iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows    ESRB:   E    Publisher(s):   Josh Wardle, The New York Times Company    Summary:   Wordle is a web-based word-guessing game developed by Josh Wardle that took the world by storm in 2021. Players are given a five-letter word to guess and have six attempts to get the word correct. When they get a letter correct, it will mark itself as green if it&#39;s in the correct position and yellow if it is the correct letter in the wrong position. A yellow letter also means that letter could appear more than once. Wordle was purchased by The New York Times Company in 2022 and added to their website and app, keeping the core game free to play as promised - with additional words and other bonuses available through subscription, and is available via browser, iOS, and Android.
