## Literature Review

The Spider-Man franchise is home to a vast roster of supervillains, a few of these Iconic figures need to be in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s sequel.




Insomniac Games&#39; Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is the latest in a series of video games that has done a phenomenal job of including a vast range of powerful adversaries for Peter Parker and Miles Morales to face - both universally known enemies and those that are little recognized outside the most dedicated Spider-Man fans. Despite this, there are a significant number of enemies that absolutely must feature in the inevitable sequel to the latest entry, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 - a few of whom have never made it into a game, but absolutely have the potential to be devastatingly powerful bosses that torment both Peter and Miles as well as New York.
[Warning: The following article contains minor spoilers for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.]
With Venom and Kraven headlining the villains in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, it&#39;s unlikely that they will make a reprisal of their roles for a while; however, the Spider-Man franchise has an extensive roster of absolutely outstanding supervillains that could make the next game even better - not an easy feat considering the outstanding quality of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Mans 2&#39;s storytelling and gameplay. Though obvious, widely known choices may be more likely, fans of the Spider-Man franchise are most certainly eagerly anticipating the appearance of some of the unique, powerful, and outstanding enemies in all the Marvel universe in the next installment of Insomniac&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series of games.
            
 
 &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review 
Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.












 








 10  Joystick 
Alter Ego Janice Olivia Yanizeski
        

The Spider-Man antagonist, Joystick, is a relatively unknown supervillain, only appearing in comic books. Despite this, she possesses a unique set of abilities and her gimmick would likely make her an interesting character for Spider-Man to face in any future Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man sequel. Though Joystick does not possess the name recognition to make her a significant figure in a game&#39;s story, she could prove to be an excellent henchman or side mission boss battle, filling a similar role to Wraith in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Joystick is driven by challenge and risk; she is the ultimate thrill seeker, a fact that could play a sizable role in her manifestation in a game.





 9  Morlun 
No Known Alter Ego
        

Morlun is a powerful enemy in the Spider-Man universe. A non-human adversary, Morlun is an inheritor and as a result, he gains his power by feeding on totems - people such as Spider-Man who have developed animal-themed powers. This proves to be Morlun&#39;s motivation and would afford him an excellent boss dynamic in any future Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games. Though he has yet to make an appearance in a video game, Morlun would be a perfect boss to face Peter and Miles in New York City - either as a powerful main antagonist or as a tune-up fight for the main event.





 8  Black Cat 
Alter Ego Of Felicia Hardy
        

A master thief, Felicia Hardy, better known as Black Cat, made a brief appearance during the main story of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but left New York for Paris. Black Cat has been a fixture in the Spider-Man roster since the late 1970s, and as a result, she has developed a degree of notoriety and name recognition that would certainly justify her inclusion in future games. Though she has worked with Peter in the past, Black Cat&#39;s penchant for crime could make her a perfect replacement for Wraith, a character that is worked with for several missions before a tricky boss fight ensues.





 7  Spot 
Alter Ego Of Jonathan Ohnn
        

Although not the most visually impressive or intimidating supervillain, Spot possesses an impressive arsenal of powers that would transition amazingly in future Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games. Spot can teleport himself - or anyone or anything - to wherever he wants, an ability that has the potential for a multi-stage boss battle set all around New York, or out of New York. A boss battle against Spot would be perfect if Kingpin makes a return in the next game, primarily as the two have a history of working together. Spot was a doctor who gained his abilities during an experiment orchestrated by Kingpin.





 6  Chameleon 
Alter Ego Of Dmitri Nikolayevich &#34;Anatoly&#34; Smerdyakov
        

The Chameleon has the inauspicious, but notable, honor of being the first-ever antagonist of Spider-Man. During the &#34;Unidentified Targets&#34; side activity in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, the supervillian Chameleon makes a very brief cameo, perhaps a sign that he will play a part in a future Insomniac Spider-Man game. The half brother of Kraven, Chameleon could seek revenge for his recently deceased sibling. Although Spider-Man is not responsible, his sheer rage could make that an easily overlooked fact. Chameleon, as his name may suggest, has a skill set that allows him to be a master of disguise - a power that could be interestingly employed in a sequel to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.





 5  Doctor Octopus 
Alter Ego Of Dr. Otto Gunther Octavius
        

Doctor Octopus is one of Spider-Man&#39;s big three archenemies - he is an icon of the series with almost as much name recognition as Spider-Man himself. The founder and leader of the Sinister Six, Doc Ock was already the main villain and final boss of the first Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. During Spider-Man 2, Otto is held as a prisoner at the Raft, and plays no part in the story, but he does feature prominently in one of the credits scenes. This scene does more to tease Green Goblin&#39;s potential appearance in the next game, but Doc Ock making a return would certainly be a highlight.

 Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Ending &amp; Credits Scenes Explained (In Detail) 
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 depicts the difficulty in rebuffing both Kraven the Hunter and Venom, and the ending is both hopeful and heart-wrenching.








 4  Green Goblin 
Alter Ego Of Norman Osborn


 







The man behind the mask of Green Goblin plays an enormous role in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but never as the bad guy. Norman Osborn is the father of Harry Osborn, Venom&#39;s host through most of the game. With Harry incapacitated, seemingly in a coma at the end of the game, it seems likely that Norman will seek revenge against Spider-Man - he certainly seems to blame the heroes at the end of the game. Norman&#39;s final scene in Spider-Man 2 has him requesting the preparation of the &#34;G-Serum&#34; from an unknown person on the phone, strongly hinting he&#39;ll take on his iconic villain role in the next game.





 3  Morbius The Living Vampire 
Alter Ego Of Michael Morbius
        

Though Morbius has become the subject of a meme in the wake of Jared Leto&#39;s performance of the character in 2022&#39;s Morbius, Morbius as depicted in the comics would be a great boss battle in a Spider-Man game. Morbius the Living Vampire is, as the name implies, a vampire, and he possesses the quintessential skill set of such an undead creature. Furthermore, the addition of a tragic, even sympathetic, adversary could allow the game&#39;s writers to craft a very interesting and moving story that was not entirely possible with the roster of supervillains that featured in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.





 2  Carnage 
Most Notable Host: Cletus Kasady


 







Although Carnage is primarily the archenemy of Venom, the red-tinted symbiote and its most famous host, Cletus Kasady, have already appeared in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Kasady is the villain of a side mission chain called &#34;The Flame,&#34; in which he&#39;s the leader of an arsonist cult of the same name. Peter Parker teams up with Wraith to put a stop to The Flame&#39;s machinations, but Kasady manages to escape justice and gain possession of a symbiote he claims was stolen from Oscorp. It seesm likely Carnage will appear in Spider-Man 2 DLC, but the character is a significant enough member of Spidey&#39;s rogues gallery that a larger role in the next full game wouldn&#39;t hear many objections.





 1  Kingpin 
Alias Of Wilson Grant Fisk


 







An antagonist in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and a minor antagonist in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Kingpin was notably absent from Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Perhaps Insomniac will consider bringing him back as a sequel&#39;s main antagonist, a position he would excel in. Kingpin is one of the most feared and powerful crime bosses in New York City; while he is currently incarcerated, perhaps in the next game he could escape and wreak havoc on the city he has dominated for so long - hiring an extensive list of tough henchmen to help him defeat, once and for all, his nemesis, Spider-Man. It is undeniable that Kingpin would make for an excellent villain in a future Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man game.
