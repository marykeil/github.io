## Literature Review

The ruins of the Zonai seen in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild provide subtle connections to classic franchise lore.




The Zonai ruins, which can be found across Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, hide some subtle references to classic Zelda lore. The nature of the Zonai is perhaps the greatest mystery of BOTW, and they are central to many of the lingering mysteries of TOTK. But these games&#39; masterful use of environmental design has also given many hints to aspects of Zonai culture, including some links to long-established aspects of the Zelda canon.




                  Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom May Hint At The Sheikah Tribe’s Origins   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could be offering players a clue to the ancient history of the Sheikah tribe with a subtle detail.   

The Zonai and their history are somewhat vague even after their proper debut in Tears of the Kingdom, with Zelda’s memories of her time spent with Rauru and Mineru only offering brief glimpses of how the last of the Zonai lived as part of Hyrule. They clearly inhabited TOTK’s iconic sky islands, with their reach extending all the way to the Depths, but most of their structures are clearly no longer fit for this purpose. However, as with real-life archaeology, even the most mysterious of Zonai ruins can still demonstrate parts of their culture through how it informed their architecture.


 Ancient Zonai Statues Reference The Legendary Triforce 
          




In BOTW alone, the Zonai ruins visible on Hyrule’s surface feature several recurring motifs. Statues of boars, owls, and even dragons are common sights, implying that these creatures were of great significance to the ancient race. As revealed in the book Creating a Champion, these statues are actually symbolic of The Legend of Zelda’s Triforce and the values it represents: Power, Wisdom, and Courage. Naturally, Triforce symbolism is a common theme throughout the Zelda franchise in a variety of ways, and the three aspects have commonly been associated with Ganon, Zelda, and Link. But as the Zonai prove, they aren’t the only people who can be influenced by the Triforce.



In the original The Legend of Zelda, only the Triforce of Power and Triforce of Wisdom appear to exist; the Triforce of Courage was actually introduced in its sequel, The Adventure of Link.




It seems that both these associations and others are the core inspirations for the choice of animals depicted by the Zonai. Ganon, who takes the form of a boar on occasion, is clearly being referenced in the Zonai’s own Power symbolism. Owls, meanwhile, are commonly associated with wisdom even in real life, with examples such as them being associated with the Greek goddess Athena. Within the Zelda canon, this common association can be seen reflected in the multiple times that Link is guided by an owl on his quests, such as Ocarina of Time’s infamous Kaepora Gaebora.





 



 The Legend Of Zelda’s Dragons Are An Ideal Representation Of Courage 
          

Dragons themselves can indeed be associated with Courage, such as BOTW and TOTK’s Farosh, although it should be noted that they can also just as easily be associated with the other parts of the Triforce as with Dinraal and Naydra. On the other hand, the Spring of Courage lies at one end of the Dracozu River, which, as the name suggests, forms a distinctly draconic shape. It is entirely possible that the Zonai took note of this and Farosh’s presence in the area, leading to them specifically associating dragons with Courage over the rest of the Triforce.




Of course, there is another way in which dragons may have become considered courageous. The forbidden act of swallowing a Secret Stone and undergoing Draconification can certainly be a courageous act, given the immense sacrifice involved. And given that it is a known effect, then there were likely previous instances of individuals deciding to eat Secet Stones before Zelda became the Light Dragon, perhaps explaining the presence of Dinraal, Naydra, and Farosh. If, like Zelda, these were willing sacrifices made in pursuit of some greater good, then it is easy to see how the Zonai could associate dragons with an immense act of courage, even as they also forbade it.



 The Zonai’s Statues Prove Their Respect For the Golden Goddesses 
         

The prevalence of these statues makes it clear that the Zonai were aware of the Triforce and the Golden Goddesses, although they are never directly mentioned in either game. As such, it is reasonable to presume that the Zonai worshipped the goddesses, or were at least highly respectful of them. It should be noted that it is unclear precisely how legitimate the Zonai’s own rumored divine ancestry is, which would doubtlessly have affected how they interacted with the existing Hyrulean pantheon. But even if the Zonai only assimilated the Golden Goddesses into their culture after coming to Hyrule, the prevalence of symbolic statues indicates that doing so wasn’t half-hearted.




It is worth noting that Sonia’s appearance also reinforces this idea, with the image of the Triforce clearly visible on her arm. This is further proof that the divine artifact, and by extension its creators, were known entities at the time of the first queen of Hyrule. Of course, given the fact that this same knowledge seems to have faded from modern Hyrule, the fact that the most recognizable monuments to the creator goddesses are obscure ruins themselves seems especially poignant. Although everything could, of course, change in a future title, it seems that the Zonai’s remaining monuments are the only tributes to the Golden Goddesses currently in Hyrule.

                  Is The Barbarian Armor In Zelda: TOTK &amp; BOTW Really Zonai?   Although the Barbarian Armor has long been believed to come from the Zonai, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom casts doubt on that assumption.   

The Zonai are a mystery in many respects, but the remnants of their culture can still explain small things about the way they lived. In addition to this, their ruined statues provide an intriguing link to the wider lore of The Legend of Zelda and its deities. The carved boars, owls, and dragons of the Zonai are tangible artifacts that make the ancient civilization much more believable than it may otherwise be. The relics do not have a direct bearing on Link’s quest but provide an understated source of worldbuilding that helps to flesh out who the Zonai were.
