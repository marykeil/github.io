## Literature Review

November 23rd’s Wordle answer contains a repeating vowel that is bound to throw many players off if they don’t use some relevant hints.





While the answer is quite common, Wordle’s hard mode should be used to discover the repeating letters. This mode prevents players from using random guesses, which can help you carry on your daily streak. However, since there is a repeating letter, you will still need to be careful with your attempts. At some point, if you find it difficult to solve the answer, you can use some relevant hints that might help.
