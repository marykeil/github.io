# The Biggest Ark Survival Ascended News Has Nothing To Do With A DLC


## SUMMARY

A major update to the game&#39;s development kit is being planned to allow players to create entirely new games using the system.   The graphical quality of Ark: Survival Ascended&#39;s assets, which push the detail possible in Unreal Engine 5, makes it easier to create appealing environments when using the dev kit.

## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended is getting DLC in the near future, but the more exciting content additions will come from a different avenue entirely.




DLC expansions might seem like the main thing to look forward to in the future of Ark: Survival Ascended, but the most interesting update in the works is a different sort of thing entirely. Ark: Survival Ascended already has a much clearer roadmap than most games, thanks to the fact that it follows a pre-established formula as a remake of Ark: Survival Evolved. The big focus is on delivering all of the DLC that the original game featured, although the core content will be free for anyone who purchased the game this time instead of racking up individual transactions again.




At the moment, much of the hype for future content is centered around Scorched Earth, a desert-focused expansion that&#39;s been confirmed for a release on April 1, 2024. Ragnarok and Abberation should be following up Scorched Earth in the near future, although an earlier estimate of Q1 2024 launches might need some adjustment. In total, there are 12 DLC packages from Survival Evolved for Ark: Survival Ascended to work through, so it&#39;s safe to say development on the title should be busy for quite some time.

                  What Is The Max Character Level In Ark: Survival Ascended?   Those looking to become the most powerful in their Ark: Survival Ascended servers must be at the max level, which isn&#39;t an easy task.    


 ASA&#39;s Developer Kit Update Could Change The Game 
         

The most recent Community Crunch update from the official Ark: Survival Ascended blog talks about Scorched Earth and some other upcoming content, but the most interesting thing that it covers is a major update to the game&#39;s development kit. The ASA devkit has been available for several months already, but so far its primary focus has been on giving players the tools to make mods and community content in the game. With the planned update, however, developer Studio Wildcard is attempting to &#34;put the power of unbridled game creation directly&#34; into the hands of the community.




Although this could just sound like vague promises, Studio Wildcard makes it clear that it really does intend for players to have everything they need to make entirely new games using the system. A platformer will apparently be included as a sample, and the Community Crunch mentions a PvP dinosaur-fighting arena as a random idea for inspiration. Ark: Survival Ascended players who are already veterans of Ark: Survival Evolved might find this news welcome, as it should herald a much wider range of gameplay possibilities accessible through the game that could help freshen it up and keep it feeling new.

 The Dev Kit Update Makes ASA Into A Game Platform 
          




Ark: Survival Ascended isn&#39;t the first game to focus on offering community game-building tools, and looking at prior examples helps clarify just exactly how this could transform its future. One direct comparison is Fortnite, which likewise runs on Unreal Engine 5 and provides players with an extensive kit for creating content with Fortnite assets to be used within the client. The publication of Unreal Editor for Fortnite in 2023 felt like a natural outgrowth of the game&#39;s evolution, which has taken it from a survival game eclipsed by its battle royale to a robust suite of gameplay options unified by a launcher.

The success of initiatives like this can be traced back to a number of inspirations, but perhaps the most significant is Roblox, which launched with a focus on community-made game modes rather than eventually evolving to support them. Originally released in 2006, the platform has seen significant growth over the years in spite of a variety of Roblox controversies that have dogged its monetization schemes and poor attempts at moderation. Considering its popularity, it&#39;s no surprise that more and more titles are seeing the advantage of playing into similar community appeal.




What gives Ark: Survival Ascended a unique appeal is the graphical quality of its assets, which pushes the detail possible in Unreal Engine 5 much further than Fortnite&#39;s cartoony style. Although the focus on prehistoric (and mythical) creatures gives any resources that are easy to use a very specific flavor, the surplus of dense environmental detail in the game should make it much easier to create appealing environments when using the dev kit. The biggest barrier to entry may be $44.99 price tag attached to Ark: Survival Ascended, which doesn&#39;t compare particularly favorably against the free-to-play models of Fortnite and Roblox.



 Ark: Survival Ascended Has A Big Focus On Mods 
          

Mods are often viewed as a PC-centric aspect of video games, but Ark: Survival Ascended is one title that&#39;s pushing the accessibility of community-made content for console users. The game is officially partnered with major mod platform CurseForge, making content published for the game automatically accessible on both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. Although the dev kit itself is only accessible on PC, this still makes the dev kit updates relevant for console players as well, pointing to more options across systems.






Although Bethesda is widely known for mod availability on consoles, Starfield&#39;s planned Xbox mod platform hasn&#39;t yet launched, showing how low of a priority it can often be.




Community Crunch posts also highlight Studio Wildcard&#39;s interest in supporting mod content by including a Mods Spotlight session. At the moment, this tends to focus on newly made creatures or fresh cosmetic options, but the possibility of creating actual games with the dev kit might change the kind of content showing up in the Mods Spotlight in the future. Both approaches are valuable for the game&#39;s longevity, as improving the base game and introducing new ways to play altogether can prevent the official game modes of Ark: Survival Ascended from becoming stale.

The introduction of the improved dev kit might not provide the immediate boost in Ark: Survival Ascended content that DLC, like Scorched Earth, will, but its long-term effects are likely to be more substantial by a wide margin. According to the Community Crunch update, this change should be coming before the end of January, although the tradition of delays for Ark content could always strike before then. Regardless, it shouldn&#39;t be too long before the expanded dev kit is accessible for Ark: Survival Ascended players, and it could well transform the game for years to come.
