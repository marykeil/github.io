## Literature Review

My Time At Sandrock is launching with over twenty NPCs available for dating and romance, and players can even have kids with their chosen partner.




My Time At Sandrock has been available on PC in early access for quite some time with regular updates and additions being made to the game, but now is officially being released as a full game. Although this doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t still be new characters or story added in the future, at launch there are an astounding 21 romance options available. Players can date their favorites, marry them, and even have children in this wholesome post-apocalyptic life sim RPG.
Relationships in My Time At Sandrock are an extra, optional thing and marriage is not required, but the option to date, propose, and have kids with a favorite NPC can add a lot of value to the game. Plus, having a strong friendship with NPCs can unlock perks, character-specific questlines, and even give cheaper rates on goods and services. While potential partners are plentiful in My Time at Sandrock, some are definitely better candidates than others.
            
 
 &#34;One Of The Best Life Simulation Games In Years&#34;: My Time at Sandrock Review 
My Time at Sandrock expands and improves upon its predecessor in almost every way, creating one of the most memorable simulation games in years.













 








 21  Pen 
Self-Proclaimed Protector Of Sandrock
        

Pen is a strong character with an extravagant style and a pit of a pride issue. He has named himself the Protector of Sandrock and an Enforcer of the Church of the Light, but comes across more as a supervillain than a superhero. His remarks on others&#39; appearances can be a bit cruel and overall he is an arrogant person, although it&#39;s possible his personality may soften in a romance, he&#39;s perhaps My Time at Sandrock&#39;s least enticing bachelor.





 20  Miguel 
Pastor Of The Church Of The Light
        

Like Pen, Miguel has more of a supervillain aura than a respectable church pastor in My Time At Sandrock. He is a very clever person and has strong feelings about how the church and Sandrock itself should be run, but not much kindness. He does, however, have a strong work ethic and is good friends with everyone affiliated with the church.





 19  Catori 
Owner Of The Golden Goose &amp; Catori&#39;s Museum
        

Catori has impressive goals of creating a world-renown entertainment complex, the Golden Goose, in My Time At Sandrock and previously divorced her husband for not being supportive enough of her dreams. She has a son who she left with her Ma when she came to Sandrock in order to focus on her dreams. She is sweet, but her intense dedication to her work can be a bit off-putting.
            
 
 My Time at Sandrock: Romance Guide (Likes, Love &amp; Dislikes) 
My Time at Sandrock has seven male characters and seven female characters that can be romanced, and each person has different likes and dislikes.









 18  Grace 
Cook At The Blue Moon Saloon
        

Grace is one of the characters in My Time At Sandrock who just feels like there needs to be a little more development for her. Her character is very shy, and she is an archeology student working on a thesis while staying in Sandrock. She is the cook at the Blue Moon Saloon, but is actually quite awful at cooking.





 17  Unsuur 
Member Of The Civil Corps
        

Unsuur has a mysterious past and nobody really knows of his life before he joined the Civil Corps. Despite being very quiet, he is hardworking and kind. Unsuur requires a little more understanding and patience than some of the other characters, but is also a very interesting and wonderful NPC. He works hard to keep Sandrock safe and is friendly with all the animals in My Time at Sandrock.





 16  Arvio 
Owner Of By The Stairs
        

Arvio is Amirah&#39;s brother and both of them came to Sandrock to open their own shops. He is a talented and hardworking entrepreneur who is always trying to rise above his difficult upbringing. He loves Amirah and would do anything for her, which is a very sweet relationship to watch. At times, his determination can come across a bit too much like a used car salesperson, with more of a focus on making money than building relationships with others.
            
 
 My Time At Sandrock&#39;s Most Original Character Customization Options 
My Time at Sandrock, the sequel to My Time at Portia, introduces a complex character creator with unique and diverse customization options.









 15  Elsie 
Rancher
        

Elsie grew up in Sandrock on a ranch and is very fond of animals and a great horseback rider. She is caring and loyal, although very wary of newcomers to the area. Between her clothing and some of her dialogue, she comes across as a bit immature, and it is hard to not see her as a child or teenager.





 14  Qi 
Director Of The Research Center
        

Qi may not be the most charismatic of characters, but he is an accomplished scientist from Vega 5 and a very sweet guy once a player chooses to get to know him better. In My Time At Sandrock he focuses on research a lot, even forgetting to eat quite often and is a fan of robots and old cartoons. As a nice throwback to My Time At Portia, he is best friends with Mint from that game.





 13  Venti 
Member Of The Eufaula Salvage Team
        

Venti has the adorable fact of sharing a name with a Starbucks cup, and is a cheerful and optimistic character despite growing up in a junkyard. Her life has been hard, fighting for scraps to eat, and she is a hard worker as a result. She is the youngest on the Eufaula Salvage team and nice, yet she also seems as though given her difficult history that her personality should be a bit more developed and distinct.





 12  Logan 
Wanted Criminal
        

For players who prefer the &#34;bad boys,&#34; Logan is quite literally a wanted criminal in My Time At Sandrock with a reckless nature. He has strong opinions on justice and his backstory is quite well-developed. It is interesting to get to know him and put the pieces of his story together and decide whether he truly is an evil bandit or just misunderstood.





 11  Amirah 
Artist &amp; Owner Of Ceramic Gate
        

Amirah is Arvio&#39;s sister and a talented artist in pottery. She loves making ceramics and enjoys all forms of art such as sculptures and paintings. She is a bit of a workaholic and can be a bit overbearing with her brother, but is a very kind person who truly loves what she does. She can be a bit difficult to romance because of her focus on her craft.





 10  Pablo 
Owner Of Pablo&#39;s Parlor
        

Pablo is talented when it comes to his passions of fashion and hairstyles, but seems a bit underdeveloped otherwise. He loves gossip and knowing everything that is going on in the town and other towns. He is often talking about everything happening in the surrounding cities, and gives the impression that he would rather be elsewhere.





 9  Burgess 
Runs The Water World Shop
        

Burgess is an incredibly honest, conscientious, and loyal guy who is very religious, being a member of the Church of the Light. He runs the store Water World near the Water Tower and suffers from a lot of anxiety about trying to do the right thing. He may not be the most conventionally attractive, and is a bit uptight about some things, but he is a good-hearted guy that just wants to help everyone and do the right thing in all situations.





 8  Jane 
School Teacher
        

Jane is the most recent addition to the game, being added to My Time At Sandrock just prior to the full release of the game. She is a school teacher who is not present immediately in the game but will move to the town after the &#34;Let&#39;s School&#34; quest has been triggered after a crucial plot point in the story.





 7  Ernest 
Reporter &amp; Aspiring Writer
        

Ernest is a writer who moved to Sandrock after his train was attacked by Logan. He is very interested in learning more about Logan and writing a story about him, and wants to interview everyone in My Time At Sandrock to learn more about him. He also enjoys writing books for preteens and wants to become as famous as his sister, the famous singer, Luna. Unfortunately, although Ernest is a fun character and a great romance option, he spends a lot of his time alone in his apartment, so it is hard to catch him to build the relationship.





 6  Heidi 
Architect


 







Heidi is from Sandrock originally and her family is all in the area, although she went to Atara to get her degree as an architect. She owns Construction Junction and occasionally writes articles for the local newspaper. She is one of the nicest characters in the game as well as being highly educated.





 5  Justice 
Sheriff


 







Justice is the head of the Civil Corps and the sheriff of Sandrock. He is strong and energetic and is often seen patrolling the area trying to help anyone he can. His name was originally Maurice, but he changed it many years back to reflect his values and beliefs, and it is a very fitting name for a sheriff. He is a great character with a sense of humor and compassion for all, and is incredibly sweet when he is in a romance.





 4  Nia 
Student


 







Nia is a childhood friend of the main character, but she actually does not live in Sandrock. She communicates regularly with the main character through letters as she is attending botany school in Highwind. She visits Sandrock at one point, and eventually does move back to the area. Interactions with Nia can be a bit strange at first as it feels that the player should know her much better than they do, but she is a very sweet girl.





 3  Fang 
Doctor


 







Doctor Fang has a pet raven, X, and is a bit mysterious with a broken past. He uses alternative medicines that work surprisingly well and is a very quiet and shy individual. He requires a lot of patience and his quests take a long time, but a relationship with Fang is also ultimately one of the most rewarding in the game.
A great way to get closer to Fang is to actually befriend his raven, X. 






 2  Mi-an 
Builder


 







Mi-an is new to Sandrock, arriving around the same time that the main character does, and is a builder. She is very hardworking, cheerful, and bubbly, and one of the sweetest people in the game, always showing enthusiasm for everything. In My Time At Sandrock, Mi-an is determined to help bring Sandrock back to its glory days and is included in many of the quests throughout the game.
