## Literature Review

Exclusive: Newly-announced heist game Den of Wolves will have features the developer originally wanted to implement in previous title GTFO.




A recent developer interview revealed that the upcoming heist game Den of Wolves will be able to implement features that didn&#39;t make it into the studio&#39;s previous title GTFO. Announced this week at The Game Awards, Den of Wolves comes from Swedish developer 10 Chambers, which was co-founded by Simon Viklund and Ulf Andersson, two veterans of the Payday franchise. With the punishing horror shooter&#39;s content coming to an end, 10 Chambers has shifted focus to Den of Wolves, but unimplemented ideas from their previous release won&#39;t all be left behind.




Screen Rant recently interviewed Simon Viklund, who serves as narrative director on Den of Wolves, to discuss what players can expect from the game. While talking about lessons learned from his time on GTFO, the developer revealed that the creative freedom the team has with the new title will allow for features not possible in their first release, including opportunities for more lore. Check out the full quote below:


Simon Viklund: There&#39;s a lot of little things throughout the entire development. Learning to kill darlings when you&#39;re a small team, hoping of course that we don&#39;t have to do that as much when we have more resources that we do now. And maybe we can even pick some of those things up that we wanted to put into GTFO that would work in the context of Den of Wolves and actually implement those in that game.
A lore library is one of those things. It&#39;s very hard to keep track of the lore in GTFO and we want to present it in a more digestible way in Den of Wolves. It&#39;s one of those things that makes taking in the storytelling easier on the player.





                  GTFO Review: A Brutal Shooter That Strikes Pay Dirt   After years in Early Access, GTFO succeeds in providing a brutally difficult FPS co-op experience for like-minded friends and courageous solo acts.   


 Clearer Lore Is Great News For Den Of Wolves 
         

The lore of GTFO has always been doled out to players in bits and pieces, largely told through things like audio recordings and environmental storytelling. With the eighth and final GTFO Rundown releasing this week, the title&#39;s storyline will finally be wrapped up, but it&#39;s undoubtedly been hard to keep track of all its intricacies over the years due to the nature of how the narrative is presented. While this hasn&#39;t held the game back in any major way, for fans of lore having everything condensed into one place helps to add a clear through line and enhances its overall depth.





 

Though not much about Den of Wolves has been revealed so far, its gritty sci-fi setting and web of shady corporations have great potential for engaging and intricate storytelling. Player characters in the game aren&#39;t pre-defined, allowing heisters to project any motivations they want onto them, and it&#39;s much easier for fans to construct their own backstories with everything clearly laid out in front of them. A lore library likely isn&#39;t the only thing cut from GTFO developers will include in Den of Wolves, but with most details still under wraps, players will have to wait to find out more.
