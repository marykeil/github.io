## Literature Review

The Sims 4â€™s upcoming DLC For Rent will let players build apartments for groups of Sims to live in close confines, with all the drama that includes.




Another Expansion Pack is coming to The Sims 4, and this time it will allow players to become property owners and run their own apartment buildings for a little community of Sims, or become a tenant in an already established complex or duplex. The notion of having multi-residential buildings in The Sims 4 has been requested many times over the years and opens up a plethora of opportunities for hilarious hi-jinks and dramatic interactions. As a twisted bonus, the For Rent expansion gives a whole new way for Sims to die a gross and painful death by mold.




The Sims 4 For Rent Expansion Pack will include a lot of changes to the very way that homes can be divided within an individual building, letting a structure have a basement rental, become a duplex, or have several apartments on one lot. The new city of Tomarang also offers a bustling nightlife with a Southeast Asian-inspired feel and cuisines in the area&#39;s Night Market. With Sims living in such close quarters, regular community events such as potlucks and pool parties are a great chance to mix and mingle.

                  &#34;Delivers Exactly What It Claims To And Little More&#34;: The Sims 4 Horse Ranch Review   The Sims 4 Horse Ranch Expansion Pack adds several worthwhile features to the game, but feels more like a Game Pack than an EP in terms of its depth.

 New Features Included In The Sims 4 For Rent 
Buildings Can House Multiple Families
          

The Sims 4 has various different levels of DLC content, from small Stuff Packs to larger, full add-on expansions. The Sims 4 For Rent is an Expansion Pack that includes an entirely new lot type and city for the game in addition to many other cosmetic items and possibilities. Below is an overview of everything included in For Rent.

 New Lot Type In Town  Residential Rental lots can provide a chance for multiple families to live in the same lot through rental units, duplexes, or apartments. Sims can become landlords or live as tenants in apartments.   Property Management  Sims can be property owners and live on-site as property managers next to their tenants or live in a separate location. They must keep the rental property&#39;s Unit Ratings high by keeping things working and clean, or else a Tenant Revolt or moldy deaths could occur.   City Of Tomarang  Gorgeous new architecture from Southeast Asian inspirations, as well as a new Night Market, Spirit House, Animal Sanctuary, and Botanical Garden surrounded by a lush tropical landscape.   Sim Interactions   r living quarters mean more interactions and chances for eavesdropping, snooping, and breaking and entering. Potlucks, pool parties, and other social gatherings are also fun new options for mingling.   Furniture  Many Southeast Asian-inspired decor pieces are added with the Expansion Pack, such as wood carvings, rattan chairs, beautiful fabrics and curtains, and more.   New Food &amp; Drink  Southeast Asian-inspired food and drinks are added such as Tofu Pad Thai, Burmese Samosa Soup, Khao Niao Mamuang, Pancit Bihon, Banh Cuon, Halo Halo, and Thai Iced Milk Tea.   Street Eats Digital Content  If The Sims 4 For Rent is purchased between November 2 and January 18, a Grill Cart, Street Umbrella, and Fruit Basket will be included as bonus gifts.   






New activities for children are also included with games of hopscotch and marbles added as interactive objects. Kids may enjoy playing with other kids in their neighboring apartments as well, particularly if there are outdoor playgrounds on the lot that they can easily share.


 

Whether living in an apartment or being a landlord, there are negatives to having apartments and rental units, just like in real life. Noisy neighbors, electrical problems, broken plumbing, and mold are just a few of the possible irritations that can lead to Sims getting unhappy about the situation. Plus, the mold might be a bit more than just an irritation.



 Mold Can Kill Sims In Dirty Apartments 
Mold Can Also Spread To Neighboring Sims
         




Some players find that killing Sims in new and creative ways can be highly entertaining, and The Sims 4 For Rent Expansion Pack introduces Sims to the concept of deadly (and gross) mold. When areas are not kept clean, this green and black fungus can grow and spread, and will not just make Sims sick but can kill them. Their ghostly green specters won&#39;t leave it at that either, as they can then share the infection with others post-mortem.



 For Rent Introduces Property Ownership &amp; Micro-Communities 
New Sim Interactions Can Create Plenty Of Drama
         

Food stalls, the Night Market, and more all encourage Sims to leave their apartments and interact with each other. The socializing that can happen at potlucks, pool parties, or even just bumping into one another in common areas will provide more social opportunities than previously seen but also gives even more chances for drama, particularly with the introduction of Snooping abilities.






 Bonus Items For Purchasing The Sims 4 For Rent early

The Southeast Asian cultural inspirations for the For Rent Expansion Pack and the city of Tomarang were designed in collaboration with Asian-American rapper and social justice advocate Jason Chu, who is a cultural expert and has family ties to Southeast Asia.
