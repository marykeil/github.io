## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

Players can increase the total number of Elden Ring&#39;s talismans they can equip to four by acquiring all Talisman Pouches present throughout the game.





You can increase the number of slots by finding Talisman Pouches. Two can be acquired by defeating Elden Ring&#39;s non-optional bosses, but others can be easily missed. One of the Talisman Pouches can easily be missed since it requires players to speak to an NPC, who will disappear if players progress too far into the game.

 Extra Talisman Slot #1 
          

The first Talisman Pouch that unlocks an additional slot can be acquired by beating Margit, the Fell Omen. She can be encountered in Stormhill as they make their way to Stormveil Castle. Margit will be your first major challenge, as she can be quite challenging to beat. However, if you summon Sorcerer Rogier just before the fog gate, you will have a better chance of defeating her. Additionally, you can acquire the Lone Wolf Ashes, which are quite powerful at this stage of the game, and buy Margit&#39;s Shackle from Patches, as it will ground Margit and allow you to get a few hits for free.

 Extra Talisman Slot #2 
          

The third Talisman slot can be one of the easiest to miss as it requires talking to an NPC. However, if you beat Godfrey, the NPC will disappear, and you won&#39;t get a chance to get the Talisman Pouch later on. To avoid missing out on this Talisman Pouch, after beating Godrik the Grafted, choose one of the following bosses to beat instead of Godfrey: 

  Malenia, Blade of Miquella   Mohg, Lord of Blood   Morgott, the Omen King   Rennala Queen of the Full Moon   Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy   Starscourge Radahn  

One of these bosses needs to be defeated because you will need one additional Great Rune in addition to Godrick&#39;s. Once two have been acquired, travel to the Roundtable Hold and head right and up the stairs to find Finger Reader Enia in the corner of the room. Speak to her at this point to receive the second Talisman Pouch and increase the number of slots to three.






 Extra Talisman Slot #3 
          

The final way to get more talisman slots in Elden Ring is obtained near the end of the game after you beat Godfrey, the First Elden Lord. Much like Margit, this boss will severely test your skills and will require you to be adequately prepared as well as leveled up. Players will encounter this boss in Leyndell, the Capital of Ash, after completing &#34;Crumbling Farum Azula.&#34;

After defeating Godfrey, you will acquire the final Talisman Pouch, raising the total number of talismans that can be equipped in Elden Ring to four.



Having trouble beating Godfrey and his second, much more brutal form to get the third talisman slot increase? Watch this boss fight guide video from Tyrannicon on YouTube for some helpful tips!
