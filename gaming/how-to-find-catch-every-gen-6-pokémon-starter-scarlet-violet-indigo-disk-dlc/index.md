## Literature Review

The Gen 6 Starter Pokémon from X &amp; Y can join your adventures in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet through the Indigo Disk DLC and its special biomes.





The Starter Pokémon will not appear in the Blueberry Academy biomes until you progress through the main story. Early on in the DLC, following your tutorial for BBQs (Blueberry Quests), you will have to fight Carmine, who will then formally invite you to the school&#39;s League Club. This will unlock a new feature called the Support Board, where you spend BP (Blueberry Points) on various requests for special rewards. The X &amp; Y Starters are locked behind these requests.






To earn BP to spend on the Support Board, you must complete quests around Blueberry Academy. Since each Generation 6 Pokémon is connected to one quest, you must collect over 10,000 BP to unlock all three Gen 6 Starters.




                  Every Scarlet &amp; Violet Version Exclusive In Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC doubles the number of version exclusives compared to The Teal Mask, and it&#39;s helpful to know the full list.   


 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Chespin 
          

Chespin may not fit the animal themes of most Starter Pokémon, but it is a great Grass-type Pokémon available in, surprisingly, the Polar Biome. If you want Chespin to spawn along other surprising Polar Biome Starters like Torchic from Generation 3 in Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, you will need to spend 3,000 BP on a Teranium Club request to boost the biodiversity of the Polar Biome. Once you spend the required BP, Chespin will start wandering the Polar Biome, typically near the heart of the area.






 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Fennekin 
          

Fennekin is a fox-like Fire-type Starter Pokémon from Generation 6 who eventually spawns in the Savannah Biome, home to many Fire-type Starters. You will need to access the Support Board and pay 3,000 BP to boost the biodiversity of the Savannah Biome if you want Fennekin to appear in the Indigo Disk DLC. Fennekin has often been found along the border between the Savannah and Canyon Biomes after completing the Teranium Club&#39;s request.

                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 1 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   The classic starters from Red &amp; Blue are all available in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but they require effort to unlock.   



 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Froakie 
          




Froakie is the Gen 6 Water-type Starter Pokémon and a lovable addition to any Indigo Disk team. If you want Froakie on your team, you will need to complete the 3,000 BP biodiversity request for the Coastal Biome. Once you pay 3,000 BP, you can find Froakie wandering the northern portion of the biome. With that, you can have all three Gen 6 Starter Pokémon on your team as you adventure through the Indigo Disk DLC in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
