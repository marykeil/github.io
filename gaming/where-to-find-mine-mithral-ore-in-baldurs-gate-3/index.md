## Literature Review

Mithral Ore is an important crafting material at the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which allows you to make some powerful weapons and gear.





Mithral Ore is only found when you reach the Adamantine Forge in BG3 during the events of Act 1 in the story. This area is an optional location you could easily miss as you continue exploring and interacting with parts of the world. However, you need to talk to a specific NPC that can guide you to the larger city that the Forge is a part of, but your party might run into conflict on the way.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 1   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is hiding boss encounters, powerful armor, weapons, cutscenes, and companions as long as the party knows where to look.    


 How To Reach Grymforge 
          

The only way to reach the city of Grymforge, where the Adamantine Forge is located, is to head into the Underdark during Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Depending on your choices with different groups in your playthrough, there are a couple of ways to do this. The easiest method would be to jump down the hold in the Blighted Village and enter the Underdark in a swift and chaotic fashion.



You could also use the hidden teleporter in the Sunlit Wetlands or talk your way past the guards in the Zhentarim Hideout of Waukeen&#39;s Rest to reach the Underdark. Those who have a good relationship with the goblins at the Goblin Camp could also go through the Defiled Temple.







Once in the Underdark, head to the Decrepit Village by taking the Beach Waypoint if your party has already explored this region. Talk to the Duergar NPC in this area, and start an interaction related to his boat that could transport you and your companions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. You can kill the Duergar for their vessel or convince them they need to take your party to the city.

  

Along the waters to Grymforge, you will encounter another Duergar named Corsair Greymon that will invade your ship as you approach the Forge&#39;s location. Characters with a high enough Deception or Intimidation skill could convince Greymon to let your group pass. Alternatively, you could engage in a fight with the Corsair and their allies to quickly end the threat to your party.






Certain spells like Charm Person could give you an advantage on the Charisma-based roll needed to deceive or intimidate Corsair Greymon, but those playing on higher difficulties will risk being caught trying to charm the Duergar.






 Where To Find Mithral Ore Veins 
          

You can find each of the two Mithral Ore veins in the Abandoned Refuge of the Adamantine Forge in BG3. One is to the northeast at coordinates (X: -556, Y: 277) against the cave walls where the Forge operates. Many traps and rivers of lava exist deep in the Forge, so tread carefully and pay attention to successful Perception checks that reveal environmental hazards.

The second vein of Mithral Ore is at coordinates (X: -642, Y: 253) in the northwest section of the Refuge, but more specifically in an area called the Ancient Temple. When you find a deposit of Ore, have one or more party members hit the vein with either a weapon attack or spell to dislodge a piece of Mithral. Be careful not to accidentally use an ability that cannot recover until after a rest.






Do not travel too far into the Forge if the traps greatly damage your party on the way to Mithral Ore Veins. The powerful Grym boss in the Adamantine Forge guards where you craft using Ore and can be nearly impossible to beat if you haven&#39;t rested.




                  Defeating Baldur Gate 3&#39;s Grym Is Simple If You Do This Trick At The Adamantine Forge   The Adamantine Forge fight can be a big challenge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but there&#39;s one way to make an easy victory happen in the blink of an eye.   

One of the veins you discover will be guarded by Magma Mephits or small elemental creatures that explode into the fire when they die. These small beasts can cast Heat Metal on your party but have a glaring vulnerability to cold magic like Ice Knife or Ray of Frost in BG3. Thankfully, this encounter only happens at one spot to mine Mithral ore, not both of the veins you come across.



 How To Use Mithral Ore At The Adamantine Forge 
         




You only get two pieces of Mithral Ore to use and craft two of six available items at the Adamantine Forge once the boss guarding the area has been defeated. However, you need to find the molds for these items to have the right blueprints to create them. When you have the right plans, insert the Ore into the Crucible and the correct mold of the item you want into the Mold Chamber.

Pulling down the Forge Lever when all items are in place will cause the main anvil to crash down and create the weapon or gear that works best for your party. Keep in mind that the boss of the Forge, Grym, will try to attack you and your companions the first time you try to activate the Lever. The items the Adamantine Forge can produce are:
