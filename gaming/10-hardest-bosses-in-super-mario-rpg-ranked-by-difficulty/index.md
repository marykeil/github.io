# 10 Hardest Bosses In Super Mario RPG, Ranked By Difficulty


## SUMMARY 


 Super Mario RPG has some tough bosses, so players should be prepared with recovery items, good equipment, and consistent attack timing. 
 The Valentina &amp; Dodo battle can be difficult if players are not prepared, so swapping characters before the battle can be helpful.

## Literature Review

Super Mario RPG can be deceptively hard from time to time. Here are some of its toughest bosses, and a little advice on how best to beat them.




Super Mario RPG has some tough bosses. Despite being a relatively easy game overall, it can sometimes surprise players with formidable foes who come out of nowhere. Somewhere between their cutesy character designs and gimmicky mechanics, it&#39;s easy to underestimate them, only to be left mouth agape when the entire party is defeated. As a rule, the party should always be prepared with recovery items, the finest equipment available, the best playable characters in Mario RPG, and consistent attack timing to defeat these difficult bosses.
There are 30 bosses in the Switch remake of Mario RPG, both required and optional, excluding six post-game rematches. Most of them haven&#39;t been greatly changed from the original Super Mario RPG, although a couple of bugs have been removed and stats have been fiddled with to ensure fair and interesting fights. This list draws from all of the above to assemble an aggregation of the most arduous adversaries in Super Mario RPG.

Super Mario RPG brings the fan-favorite classic back with welcome bells and whistles, inspiring players young and old to rediscover this Mario curio.












 








 10  Claymorton 
Formerly Known As Mack The Knife
        

Claymorton could be called Super Mario RPG&#39;s first actual boss. The introductory boss fights in the game are pretty trivial, and mostly only exist to teach players the basic mechanics of battle. Claymorton doesn&#39;t pull any punches, and since only two party members are available for this fight (Mario and Mallow), players will have to make the most of every turn. He&#39;s also flanked by a group of Shy Guy bodyguards, who are best eliminated first with Mallow&#39;s all-enemy Thunderbolt attacks. But just keep everyone healed up with items or Mallow&#39;s skills, and Claymorton will fall before long.





 9  Valentina &amp; Dodo 
The Refined Rogue
        

During their visit to Nimbus Land, Mario and company face off against the scheming royal aide Valentina in what may be a difficult battle if they&#39;re not prepared. On her first turn, Valentina summons Dodo, whom the party will have already fought twice by this point. Dodo kidnaps whichever party member is in the second position, forcing them into a one-on-one battle. If it&#39;s someone with lower HP, like Peach or Mallow, it could be an issue. Players can prepare for this fight by swapping Geno or Bowser into the second position before starting it.





 8  Bowyer 
Introduction To Triple Moves
 The fight against Bowyer begins as a pretty standard boss battle, until he plops three lettered squares on the field: A, X, and Y. Bowyer can hit the squares with arrows to immediately disable that battle option for Mario and his party. In essence, if he hits A, they can&#39;t attack, X, they can&#39;t use items, and Y, they can&#39;t use specials. How devastating this can be really depends on what square Bowyer hits when. Not having access to items at the beginning of battle is fine, but when the party needs healing and is low on FP, it can become a problem. Ultimately, this fight is a test of the party&#39;s flexibility. At the end, Bowyer disables all the buttons, at which point Mario, Mallow, and Geno unite to perform their first Triple Move.





 7  Speardovich 
Formerly Known As Yaridovich
        

Speardovich is mostly dangerous because of his ability to split himself into two clones, both with equal attack power. Thankfully, the move&#39;s visual effects make it easy to tell which Speardovich is the real thing. But since they both have access to unblockable skills, the two of them can deal a lot of damage before the fight is over. It may be tempting to go after the clone first, especially considering he has lower defense, but it&#39;s best to attack the real one first. Once his HP is reduced to zero, the fight ends automatically.





 6  Axem Rangers &amp; Blade 
Mighty Morphin&#39; Mario Bosses


 







The Axem Rangers are a set of five, multicolored villains who emulate tokusatsu hero bands like the Power Rangers. However, they&#39;re committed to doing evil instead of good, and plan on stealing all the party&#39;s Star Pieces in order to prevent hope from taking root. The trouble with this fight is that each Axem Ranger has a unique set of stats, including resistances, weaknesses, and special moves. It takes a lot of experimenting to figure out what works where.
This fight gets less complicated, if more difficult, in its second phase. Once they&#39;re all defeated individually, the Axem Rangers can also fuse into a Voltron-like robot, serving as the power source for a mechanical head that fires defense-negating Breaker Beams at the entire party.





 5  Exor 
The Sword In The Stone
        

At the beginning of Super Mario RPG, Mario&#39;s attempt to rescue Princess Peach is interrupted when a giant sword falls from the sky, cutting off his route to Bowser&#39;s Keep. Eventually, Mario discovers that the sword is called Exor, and he and Bowser team up against it.
What makes Exor so difficult is his ability to inflict a wide variety of status effects, sometimes multiple per turn: Sleep, Silence, and Scarecrow are among them. Exor is also composed of multiple parts, the most important of which is the pommel. Unfortunately, the pommel can only be damaged after at least one of the eyes has been downed, and the eyes regenerate after a few turns.





 4  Smithy 
The Final Boss, If Not The Hardest


 







Smithy is the final boss of Super Mario RPG, but don&#39;t think that means he&#39;s the most difficult. Sure, he hits hard and has lots of HP, but his true strength is his versatility. Smithy has five different forms: Normal, Tank, Magic, Mask, and Treasure, each of which has different strengths, weaknesses, and special moves. For example, Tank-head Smithy has great physical attacks and defense with a weakness against lightning, while Magic-head Smithy has incredibly powerful spells with a low physical defense. Smithy can swap forms every turn, so players need to pay attention and stay on their toes to beat Smithy in Super Mario RPG.





 3  Extra-Fancy Bundt, &amp; Raspberry 
No Longer A Piece Of Cake
        

Mario defeats Chef Torte and his wedding cake gone awry during the course of Super Mario RPG&#39;s main story, but he can actually return for a much harder rematch later. This is a fight against four targets: the cake&#39;s top layer Extra-Fancy Bundt, its bottom layer Extra-Fancy Raspberry, an Exhausted Chef Torte, and his Apprentice.
It&#39;s hard enough dealing with a powered-up version of Bundt and Raspberry, but this fight&#39;s unique candle mechanic is the icing on the cake. On each of their turns, the chef and his sous will attempt to light Bundt&#39;s candles. If they&#39;re all lit, Bundt and Raspberry will unite to perform their Celebration Shot ultimate attack, which can deal 9,999 damage to everyone in the party. Thankfully, the candles can be blown out with normal attacks.





 2  Duel-Ready Johnny 
A One-On-One With Jonathan Jones
        

The main game version of Johnny, the shark pirate captain, is tough enough, but in the post-game, Mario can face a more powerful version of Johnny in a one-on-one duel. Mario won&#39;t be allowed to use items or swap out teammates during this fight; it&#39;s a good old-fashioned duel.
Mario can add two other characters to his party as usual, even though they won&#39;t fight with him this time. Whoever he selects will cheer him on from the sidelines, providing a unique buff. Geno&#39;s buff, which raises Mario&#39;s speed and attack, is probably the most useful, while the third slot can go to Peach for a magic defense boost or Bowser for a physical defense boost. Either way, block timing is everything in this fight, as it&#39;s important to avoid as much damage as possible while going blow for blow with Johnny.





 1  Culex 3D 
Super Mario RPG&#39;s Secret Optional Boss


 







Super Mario RPG contains two hidden bosses, Culex and Culex 3D. They&#39;re both tough, but Culex 3D, a rematch version who&#39;s only available after finishing the main story, is easily the hardest boss in the game. With over 12,000 total HP when combined with his elemental crystals, Culex will take a while to burn down. The crystals do much of the attacking, while Culex removes any buffs placed on the party. He also has access to powerful, unblockable, non-elemental spells like Meteor. The party needs to be fully leveled and kitted out for this fight, and even then, it won&#39;t be easy.
That&#39;s the worst of the rogues&#39; gallery in Super Mario RPG. As with any game in the genre, it&#39;s important to consider party composition, item stock, and elemental weaknesses before knowingly walking into any one of these fights. Preparation is half the battle in Super Mario RPG.
