# Xbox Game Pass Is Losing One Incredible Game On January 31


## SUMMARY 



  A new set of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in January 2024 was accompanied by news that Hitman: World of Assassination will be leaving at the end of the month.   The sandbox nature of Hitman: World of Assassination allows for a wide variety of methods to eliminate targets, making it highly replayable.   While the loss of Hitman: World of Assassination is regrettable, there are new games coming to Xbox Game Pass to soften the blow, and a new Xbox Developer_Direct on January 18 may reveal more upcoming games and news.

## Literature Review

Only one title is leaving Xbox Game Pass at the end of January, but it&#39;s a package with a uniquely comprehensive amount of gameplay to offer.




Xbox Game Pass is known for its continually expanding library of games, but along with the frequent additions to the subscription service, it does occasionally lose some titles as well. Games that are set to be removed are usually announced alongside additions, so it&#39;s often easy to prepare for the changes coming in a month ahead of time. Even with an active subscription, games can&#39;t be played after they leave the service, so having enough heads-up for a decent window to play the game tends to ease a lot of potential frustration.




Although the announcement of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in January gave advance notice for titles departing on January 5 and 15, no losses in the lineup were initially confirmed for the rest of the month. As officially revealed through the Xbox Wire blog, however, Hitman: World of Assassination is leaving Xbox Game Pass on January 31 after roughly a year of availability via the service. Although this is technically just a single title being removed, anyone wanting to play through it in advance might need to carve out an impressive chunk of spare time.


 Hitman: World of Assassination Is More Than One Game 
          

Although the title doesn&#39;t offer much clarity on what&#39;s included, Hitman: World of Assassination is actually a package that includes the campaigns from all three modern Hitman games. This is an especially convenient way to enjoy the adventures of master assassin Agent 47, especially considering the fact that the first game in the trilogy was originally drip-fed as an episodic release. Outside of Xbox Game Pass, the full bundle can be purchased for a fairly standard price of $69.99, and the older standalone releases of Hitman and Hitman 2 are no longer available digitally.




For many Hitman fans, the trilogy included in World of Assassination was a return to form after the more linear experience of Hitman: Absolution, and its sandbox nature gives it an absurd amount of replayability that makes its removal from Xbox Game Pass especially unfortunate. Agent 47 has the freedom to eliminate targets through a wide variety of methods, from simple silenced pistol shots to much sillier techniques. A free Hitman: World of Assassination DLC added a roguelite mode to the game in 2023, forcing improvisation and making things feel new even for veteran players.

                  Hitman: Freelancer Review - Agent 47 At His Best   Hitman: Freelancer is a free update to the now-titled World of Assassination trilogy, and it&#39;s the best Hitman experience available on any platform.   

There are enough new games coming to Xbox Game Pass to ease the sting of losing Hitman: World of Assassination, but it&#39;s still a regrettable departure for the service. Even subscribers who don&#39;t have time to play through the trilogy before it leaves could benefit from checking out a level or two, as long as stepping into the shoes of an unfeeling killer sounds appealing. A new Xbox Developer_Direct on January 18 is likely to reveal some upcoming games and news that could further soften the blow, although January 31 will still be a sad day for Xbox Game Pass with the departure of Hitman: World of Assassination.
