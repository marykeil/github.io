# Marvel s Spider-Man 2 Just Got Another Link To Daredevil


## SUMMARY

The disappearance and subsequent return of the Nelson and Murdock law office plaque in the game suggests that Insomniac intentionally drew attention to it, possibly as a setup for Daredevil&#39;s arrival.

## Literature Review

Through reinstated Easter Eggs and interview references, Insomniac Games seems to be heavily teasing a Daredevil appearance in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.




Insomniac Games seems to be heavily teasing a Daredevil appearance in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. There has long been speculation surrounding whether the two New York superheroes could ever meet in a game, primarily as players are able to explore The Man Without Fear&#39;s stomping ground, Hell&#39;s Kitchen across all three of Insomniac Games&#39; Marvel titles to date.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2]

Whereas Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales saw their protagonists fighting crime solo for the majority of their campaigns and throughout the free-roam sections in the city, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 had both Peter and Miles&#39; Spider-Men teaming up with each other and with other characters such as Harry Osborn (when his symbiote resembled Agent Venom) and Wraith in the game&#39;s open world. With this in mind, players are hopeful that other Marvel characters could start to join in on the action when exploring New York, especially with how many are referenced across the game&#39;s map.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.    


 Daredevil Has Been Teased Throughout The Spider-Man Games 
          




In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, Peter Parker had a business card for Nelson and Murdock: Attorneys at Law in one of his many backpack collectibles. Upon opening this, Peter recalled the time a blind man gave him it and offered Spider-Man some help, wondering how a blind man knew he was Spider-Man in the first place. Players could visit the exterior of the law firm, with its plaque displayed prominently by the entrance.



The Nelson and Murdock office can be found near the center of the Hell’s Kitchen district.




The sign returned in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but then mysteriously disappeared for the launch of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, with an eviction notice on the door instead. During an episode of IGN&#39;s Beyond podcast, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s Senior Creative Director, Bryan Intihar, was asked about the missing Easter Egg, and after a very long pause he told the others on the podcast to &#34;stay tuned&#34; and reassured them that the lawyer duo was fine. Days later, the plaque was added to the game, and Intihar simply posted &#34;Guess they paid their rent&#34; in response to the news on X.





 

It&#39;s unclear whether this is an intentional plot point building up to the arrival of Daredevil, or if it was simply an asset that was missing at launch and got patched back in following Insomniac being asked about it. The eviction notice being taken off the door with its return seems to imply that its initial absence was intentional, drawing attention to the law firm before teasing the character further.

                  How Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Sets Up Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3&#39;s Story &amp; Villains   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has set up plenty of plot points for a future entry in the series, from returning villains to potential new superheroes.    



 Insomniac Seems To Be Teasing Daredevil Further 
          




On November 2, PlayStation held a listening party in which Intihar and the game&#39;s composer John Paesano discussed several tracks from the game&#39;s soundtrack. In the final seconds of the stream, Intihar casually asked “Where is Daredevil?” out of the blue. While this could be seen as trolling the fans who are adamant that the character will appear at some point, or a joke referring to the missing plaque, it could also be a tease at what&#39;s to come.


 



 How Could Daredevil Tie Into Spider-Man 2&#39;s Story? 
          

There are several ways Daredevil could be integrated into the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man stories going forward. During Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Peter and Miles try to restore Flint Marko (aka. Sandman)&#39;s memories. Upon completing every challenge in this arc and learning Marko&#39;s story and why he went on a rampage at the start of the game, they mention Peter&#39;s &#34;lawyer friend&#34; who may be able to help Marko get visitation rights to see his daughter, so Peter could reach out to Nelson and Murdock as a part of this arc going forward.






Regardless of whether players are playing as Peter or Miles, this dialogue referring to Nelson and Murdock remains intact.




Another Easter egg has been uncovered fairly recently which many have speculated could refer to one of Daredevil&#39;s main adversaries, the ninja clan known as The Hand. A hidden room on the Upper West Side could be seen through a barred window beneath a massive red flag and has various swords and other bladed weapons displayed alongside a library of books. While the emblem on the walls doesn&#39;t match The Hand&#39;s one from the comics, many believe that the kind of weapons on display could be the biggest indicator that they&#39;re active in New York. If so, Daredevil could team up with Spider-Man to stop them in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC, especially if his alter-ego has already been working with the heroes on Marko&#39;s case.
