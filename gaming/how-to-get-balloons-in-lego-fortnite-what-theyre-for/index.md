## Literature Review

Balloons are one of the most flexible and fun items in LEGO Fortnite. Crafting them involves using a Spinning Wheel and Loom to weave Silk.





Balloons in LEGO Fortnite come in two variants: Small Balloons and Large Balloons. You can easily get high up in the air by attaching them to platforms and other structures, allowing you to take scenic hot air balloon rides. They’re also great for exploration, allowing you to survey and find great new landing spots and village sites from a unique perspective.





 How To Get (And Use) A Small Balloon In LEGO Fortnite 
          

You can craft a Silk Balloon with 1 Silk Fabric, 1 Torch, and 1 Cord under the Toys tab in the Build Menu.

          

Silk Fabric isn’t easy to obtain. You’ll first need to construct a Spinning Wheel (8 Planks, 5 Wooden Rods, 5 Wood, and 5 Wolf Claws) in the Build Menu. This allows you to process Silk, which you get from killing spiders, into Silk Thread. Spiders spawn everywhere on the ground, and these tiny critters are generally quite easy to kill.

          




Silk Thread can then be woven into Silk Fabric in a Loom, which you can build in the Build Menu. A Loom requires 9 Flexwood, 8 Flexwood Rods, and 6 Sand Claws: all resources that can be obtained in the Dry Valley desert biome. To get Flexwood, cut down some of LEGO Fortnite’s Cactus plants. A single piece of Silk Fabric requires 5 Silk Thread each.

          

Torches and Cord are fairly basic crafted items. Torches can be made at a crafting bench with 3 Wood and 5 Vines, while Cord can be obtained by processing 5 Vines in the Spinning Wheel.

          




To use a Small Balloon, simply attach it to your structure of choice. With enough Small Balloons, you should be able to lift the structure off the ground. However, keep in mind that Large Balloons have more lifting power and don’t cost much more.



 How to Get (And Use) A Large Balloon In LEGO Fortnite 
          

You can craft a Large Balloon with 2 Silk Fabric, 1 Torch, and 1 Cord in the Build Menu. Essentially, you’ll need more Silk Fabric, but the rest of the recipe remains the same.



If you’re missing important resources, consider assigning new resource collection jobs to any LEGO Fortnite Villagers you’ve recruited.




Large Balloons lift more than Small Balloons. A single Large Balloon can lift a Dynamic Foundation platform, which you can build as a base for your hot air balloon builds. In contrast, it takes three Small Balloons to lift the same platform, so a Large Balloon might be a better use of your resources.




However, once you’ve built your Balloons, the sky is quite literally the limit. Hot air balloons are fun, but there’s plenty more you can do, including assembling advanced flying machines to explore your LEGO Fortnite world.

              Fortnite  Fortnite took the world by storm on its 2017 release, and it’s still one of the most popular battle royale games in the world despite stiff competition from Apex Legends and Call of Duty: Warzone. Like all games in the genre, the objective is to be the last player standing at the end, and one of the biggest differences is its tie-in characters from Star Wars and other popular franchises.The game has fast-paced gameplay, and players must rush to find weapons scattered throughout the map. Where it differs from other Battle Royales is the building mechanic, which allows you to build fortifications to protect yourself from enemy fire and delay advancing opposition.Fortnite didn’t have a split-screen mode in its official release, and Epic Games only added the feature in Chapter 2. The mode allows up to two players to enjoy the game in a horizontal or vertical orientation. Split-screen in Fortnite is available for Duos or Squads, so you can play with friends at home and team up with online players.
