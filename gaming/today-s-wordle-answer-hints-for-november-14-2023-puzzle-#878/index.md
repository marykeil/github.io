 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
November 14th #878
          

The November 14th Wordle answer is SASSY.




 For our starting Wordle word we used IRATE which only provided a single misplaced &#39;A&#39; and a large chunk of incorrect letters.                   



 For our second attempt, we tried moving the &#39;A&#39; and going with PACKS. This locked in the vowel&#39;s position and provided us with a new misplaced letter, &#34;S&#34;.                



 Moving forward our third attempt was MASON which locked in the &#39;S&#39; and added another chunk of incorrect letters.                



 We assumed the vowel must be repeated since we weren&#39;t getting anywhere with what we had so we tried BASAL as our fourth attempt. This proved incorrect and only provided even more wrong letters.                



 The mood was growing dire as we tried our fifth guess, WASHY. This brought in the letter &#39;Y&#39; and gave us just a little hope for victory.                



 The end was near, and the assumption was that the &#39;S&#39; must be repeating, for our sixth and final attempt we went with GASSY. As the &#39;G&#39; flipped to grey we knew our long-standing Wordle win streak was over, time to start anew.
