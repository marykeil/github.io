## Literature Review

HoYoverse has revealed the special promo codes during the Genshin Impact 4.4 livestream. Here are all of them and their in-game rewards.




The Genshin Impact 4.4 livestream codes are now available, allowing players to redeem them and, in turn, claim free rewards for the popular RPG, including Primogems. Before the arrival of every new update for the live-service game, developer HoYoverse tends to host a special program that highlights the new content that will be arriving. With Version 4.4 on its way at the end of January, the special Genshin Impact 4.4 livestream has showcased some of that new content, including the gameplay for the new playable character Xianyun and Gaming. During the event, HoYoverse confirmed some of the many leaks that plague its content.




An example is the confirmation of the new areas in Genshin Impact’s best region, as well as some story content set in those locations. Throughout the special program, several promo codes were shared with the spectators. These codes are a way of thanking them for watching and thanking players for their continued support of the game. When redeemed, these Version 4.4 livestream codes offer special in-game prizes, from Character EXP Materials and Weapon Enhancement Materials to the coveted Primogems, which are hard to come by and are crucial to obtaining new playable characters and weapons in the game.

                  New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.

The livestream codes for the next update were shared during the Version 4.4 special program, broadcast on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch. In total, three distinct codes were distributed during the event. All three of these codes can be redeemed by players, but there is a very strict time limit to redeeming them. The in-game rewards include Mystic Enhancement Ore, Hero’s Wit, Mora, and, of course, Primogems. The table below lists each of the codes and their respective rewards:

 How To Redeem Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream Codes 
          

In order to ensure these items are obtained, players will have to redeem the Genshin Impact codes provided to them during the Version 4.4 livestream. It is possible to do so through two different methods. The first is through the official Genshin Impact website. There, players will be required to log in with the accounts they use to play the game and fill out the empty slots. Once the codes have been redeemed, the prizes will be sent to the in-game mailbox, where players will have to manually claim the rewards.



Once players log in, the Server and Character Nickname slots on the official website should be filled in automatically.




The other way of redeeming the promo codes is through the game itself. Once logged in, players should open up their main menu and go to the settings page. From there, they should navigate to the Account tab, where they will find the Redemption Code feature. There, they simply need to insert the Version 4.4 livestream codes and click on redeem. Like through the official website method, the respective rewards are sent to their in-game mailbox. Genshin Impact 4.4 will be released on January 31, bringing forth 2024’s version of the Lantern Rite Festival, two new playable characters, and much more.
