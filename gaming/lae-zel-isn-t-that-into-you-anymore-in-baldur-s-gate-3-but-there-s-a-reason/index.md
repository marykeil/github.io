## SUMMARY 



  Romancing Lae&#39;zel in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 requires proving oneself through actions, as her loyalty to githyanki traditions values martial prowess and mental strength.   The change to Lae&#39;zel&#39;s romance requirements may be a response to speedrunners exploiting the game to quickly reach the romantic milestone.   Patch 4 not only adds the requirement for proving worth to romance Lae&#39;zel but also includes fixes to her Act 2 material, dialogue, and animations.

## Literature Review

Some new obstacles to earning Lae&#39;zel&#39;s affection in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 have arisen, and the reason that they&#39;ve appeared is a little unusual.




It might feel like building a relationship with Lae&#39;zel in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has suddenly gotten harder than it&#39;s ever been before, and there&#39;s a particular reason why this is the case. Interpersonal connections and romances play a big part in the game, especially when it comes to the Origin characters that can join the party in Act 1 thanks to the shared struggle of mind flayer parasites. Navigating these links can be tricky, especially when it comes to winning over characters who don&#39;t share the same inclinations toward good or evil as a custom Tav protagonist.




Romance ranks highly among the many Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 features to receive tweaks since the game&#39;s exit from early access to full release. Playing at launch made it obvious that something wasn&#39;t quite right, as characters like Gale were all too eager to get things started without any real prompting. Developer Larian Studios acknowledged some mistuned elements to the system that it has since worked on correcting in the several major patches. Patch 4 makes changes to Lae&#39;zel, although they&#39;re a little different from prior adjustments to Origin characters.

 You Have To Prove Yourself To Lae&#39;zel In BG3 
         




Romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is principally based on a basic system of approval, with party members responding positively or negatively toward various actions. Wyll might appreciate an act of heroism, for example, while Astarion is more likely to be impressed by a bit of manipulation. The actual decisions around entering relationships are triggered through specific conversations, but these only work at all if the general approval rating is high enough. Patch 4, available in full on the official Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 website, adds another layer to romancing Lae&#39;zel, as it&#39;s now necessary to &#34;have proven yourself worthy through your actions&#34; to acquire Lae&#39;zel&#39;s attention.

This change makes sense with Lae&#39;zel&#39;s character, as her loyalty to githyanki traditions instills a very strict code of beliefs in her and a major valuation of martial prowess and mental strength. Her willingness to hook up in the past could have been justified as a pragmatic choice, but it does ultimately seem unlikely that she would take any sort of interest in someone who didn&#39;t put in the work to really stand out. Figuring out exactly what Lae&#39;zel considers worthy will likely prove complex, but the passionate Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 community is certain to get a hold of the situation before too much time passes.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Pros &amp; Cons Of Romancing Lae&#39;zel In BG3   Maintaining a true emotional connection with the githyanki warrior might be harder than one would think, but the payoff is totally worth it.     



 Lae&#39;zel Changes Target Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Sex Speedruns 
          

There&#39;s another possible reason for Larian Studios to have singled out Lae&#39;zel as the recipient of a romance overhaul, and that has to do with speedrunners looking to bypass obstacles to getting in the sack. The wide variety of potential objectives in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has led to a number of splintered speedrun paths, with one focus being on the flippantly named Sex% speedrun. Just like Shadowheart&#39;s essential role in skipping much of the game for general speedrun purposes, Lae&#39;zel had taken on a central status as the key to fast-forwarding a relationship to the critical point.




                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.    

The crucial moment for the Sex% speedrun is the opportunity to coerce a tiefling to bow down before Lae&#39;zel, an act of forced subservience that pleases her greatly. With enough knowledge and talent, this can be triggered only a couple of minutes into the game, and it&#39;s traditionally cleared the threshold to interest her in intercourse. Whatever the worthy acts now necessary to win Lae&#39;zel over may be, they certainly get in the way of this technique. Larian Studios probably didn&#39;t find slowing the speedrun down to be a critical concern, but this approach may be what brought how quickly Lae&#39;zel can be romanced in general to their attention.



It&#39;s possible to make it through the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 opening section aboard the Nautiloid ship in under a minute with some efficient dashing and jumping.







Outside of speedruns, Lae&#39;zel hasn&#39;t managed to rise to the same level of popularity as some characters that the community has really latched onto, as indicated by an early Community Update from Larian Studios that showed her as the least picked Origin selection in character creation. Despite featuring excellent stats that make them a uniquely powerful choice to have in a party, githyanki have been an underappreciated race in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 overall. The Patch 4 changes will likely do some damage to interest in romancing Lae&#39;zel as well, although some may appreciate the added level of challenge.



 Lae&#39;zel Has Other Changes In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Patch 4 
          

The addition of proving one&#39;s worth in Patch 4 might be the biggest tweak to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 relationships with Lae&#39;zel, but it isn&#39;t the only adjustment. Her Act 2 material gets a much-needed fix by bringing a fresh romance up to speed with the surroundings, as starting on a relationship in the Shadow-Cursed Lands could previously lag behind with Act 1 material getting introduced instead. Her story is also smoothed over by removing the option to romance her immediately after certain events in the githyanki crèche, which can leave her in a state of some distress until she reorients herself accordingly.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: You Shouldn&#39;t Skip The Githyanki Crèche Questline   The Githyanki Crèche questline in Baldur’s Gate 3 is part of Lae’zel’s companion quest, but it offers plenty of information to discover.    

Other changes branch out from the romantic focus to fix some general problems with Lae&#39;zel, mostly pertaining to dialogue and story flow. Some Act 3 comments that ignored events of the first two acts have been removed, and certain dialogue scenes have added necessary triggers or removed ones that could roadblock them at inopportune times. She&#39;s also the recipient of some animation improvements, with new idle animations at camp and a fix to a sleeping animation that could make her move in an erratic cycle rather than slumbering with any semblance of peace.

Although anyone who&#39;s already deep into a relationship with Lae&#39;zel should likely still be secure in the wake of Patch 4, it&#39;s best to keep the new rules in mind if starting up a fresh game with the intent of romancing the githyanki fighter. There are always other options among the rest of the potential party members, even if some patience should ultimately pay off with Lae&#39;zel. Romance speedruns are mostly just a silly challenge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but when looking at Lae&#39;zel&#39;s new romance requirements in Patch 4, it seems like Larian Studios isn&#39;t afraid to bulldoze them for proper balance.
