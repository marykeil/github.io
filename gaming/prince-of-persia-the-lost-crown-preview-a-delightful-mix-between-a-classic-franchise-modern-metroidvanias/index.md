## Literature Review

Screen Rant went hands-on with Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown at Brazil Game Show 2023. Here are our first impressions of the game.





Instead of telling the tale of the unnamed Prince, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown follows the story of Sargon, a warrior who is part of a clan known as The Immortals. He and his colleagues are entrusted with the mission of rescuing Prince Ghassan, who has been kidnapped. While the story itself is still wrapped in mystery, the gameplay is not. Screen Rant had the opportunity to go hands-on with the new Prince of Persia game and test it during a short gameplay session at Ubisoft’s booth during Brazil Game Show (BGS) 2023.





 A Very Agile Game 
          

The build offered by Ubisoft was one that had mildly progressed beyond the start of the game, where Sargon already had a few abilities unlocked. This was key to having a better understanding of the general gameplay. The first noticeable thing about Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is that it is a very agile game. The pacing of the exploration and combat seems almost accelerated were it not for the traversal and fighting challenges. There is an immediate sense that the new Ubisoft title draws inspiration from modern-day metroidvania games such as Ori and the Will of the Wisps and, perhaps, even Hollow Knight.

Opposed to the more careful and calculated movement of older 2D Prince of Persia titles, such as The Sands of Time for Game Boy Advance, The Lost Crown relies on a frenetic yet pleasant rhythm when jumping around, running, and striking. The gameplay flows rapidly yet naturally in a very fluid and organic way. Nonetheless, it does retain the feeling of older titles as well. This is due to how environmental puzzles are presented. Even if the protagonist is moving generally faster, there are still puzzles and obstacles that demand precise timing and care when traversing. Players will still encounter rotating pillars full of death and other such classic elements.






 Traversal That&#39;s Metroidvania-Inspired 
          

There are also many sections with wall jumping, grounds full of spikes, and moving platforms. In the short period of the trial, there were several locked areas that seem to hint at an intense amount of retroactive exploration, which makes it lean even deeper into its metroidvania-inspired gameplay. Another gameplay feature that makes Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown feel like a spiritual successor to Ori and the Will of the Wisps, for instance, is the customization options when it comes. Players will be able to equip Sargon with various types of talismans, each of which grants different abilities and perks to him, either in combat or in exploration.

                  Prince Of Persia Remake: Ubisoft Shares Update Amid Cancelation Fears   After cancelation rumors and multiple delays over the years, Ubisoft has now offered another update on the Prince of Persia remake&#39;s development.    




Having the ability to enhance specific skills or perhaps improve Sargon’s chances of survival is key to the experience. Some of these talismans also alter the behavior of certain abilities, giving them more range, for instance. Similarly, players have the option to intensify the challenge presented by not giving the protagonist any advantages. The level of customization through these items is also a recurring mark of modern metroidvanias, which shows exactly how much Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown leans into what is successful in the genre at the moment.



 Slick Combat 
          

Even with how fantastic exploration feels, the slickest aspect of the gameplay so far seems to be combat. In fights, players will not let go of the game’s quick pacing, but use that to their advantage, moving around swiftly and disrupting enemies’ attacks. Sargon moves insanely fast and can reposition himself quite easily. His time-based powers can also help him with that when fighting, other than simply resetting a poorly-calculated platforming jump. The single most important aspect of combat in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, however, seems to be parrying. Not only do players avoid damage, but they are actually rewarded for doing so.




With a generous window to parry, the action works as a counter-attack, which opens up the enemies’ defenses and, on occasion, finishes them off. There are great audio and visual inputs in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown that help players react to attacks. The way that parries work makes players happily wait for an enemy to attack, only to destroy them a few seconds later. Although speed and movement are, obviously, core to the experience, these small periods of precision and patience seem to play a vital part during battles – this may be proven through tougher encounters against bosses, which were not included during the short demo session.



 A Truly Impressive Demo 
          

The remarkable gameplay offered by Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown seems to walk hand-in-hand its impressive graphics, performance, and art design. The new Ubisoft title is a wonder to behold. The characters’ animations and designs, the environmental and level designs, and the art style applied to Sargon’s skills are enchanting and make the player want to explore more to see more. The previously mentioned parries are, arguably, only as great as they are due to how well executed the animation sequence comes immediately after blocking an attack. The sheer power of a counter combined with a refined animation is what makes it feel like a reward.




While the demo was short, the feeling was of anticipation for more gameplay. The mix between classic elements of older Prince of Persia games with modern-day metroidvania seems to be paying. When combined with a game demo that is very fast and dd not present any performance issues when played on a PS5 console, it gets even better. With its fantastic art style and exquisite animations to coat it, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is aiming to be a contender as one of 2024’s best games.
