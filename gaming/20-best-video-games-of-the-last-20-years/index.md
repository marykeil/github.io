## Literature Review

In honor of Screen Rant&#39;s 20th anniversary, the Gaming team has selected the best 20 games of the last 20 years, with one entry per year.




In celebration of Screen Rant&#39;s 20th anniversary, the SR Gaming editor team has taken a deep look at how gaming has evolved since 2003, picking the best game of each year for the last two decades. From Guitar Hero to Elden Ring, here are the most memorable and industry-shaking video game releases since Screen Rant&#39;s inception.




Video games are an ever-changing and ever-growing medium, with each console generation and technological leap providing new ways to approach and enjoy gaming. In the last 20 years, gaming has seen the release of the PlayStation 3, 4, and 5, while Xbox has launched the 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Nintendo continues to pave the way for innovative console releases with the Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, and plenty of handhelds too, while VR continues to gain traction. The next 20 years will inevitably bring about a host of technical improvements and marvels, but while the future remains a mystery, video gaming&#39;s past is ripe for dissection.

                  20 Biggest Gaming Stories Of The Last 20 Years   To celebrate Screen Rant&#39;s 20th anniversary, the gaming team takes a look at some of the best - and worst - gaming stories of the last two decades.    


 Best Game Of 2003: Star Wars KOTOR 
RPG
          




   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic      Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , Nintendo Switch , Linux , Xbox One , PC     Released    June 15, 2003     Developer(s)    BioWare , Obsidian Entertainment , Saber Interactive     Publisher(s)    LucasArts , Disney Interactive , Sony Interactive Entertainment      

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is widely considered one of the best Star Wars games of all time. Its release came at a perfect time for movie fans, launching during the prequel trilogy era between Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). The game quickly turned developer BioWare into a household name and paved the way for an entire Knights of the Old Republic series. A remake of the original game was announced in 2021, though little has been heard on its development since.



 Best Game Of 2004: World of Warcraft 
MMORPG
          

   World of Warcraft      Franchise    Warcraft     Platform(s)    PC     Released    November 23, 2004     Developer(s)    Blizzard     Publisher(s)    Blizzard      




World of Warcraft has managed to stay relevant in the nearly 20 years since its release, consistently drawing in new players thanks to its expansions and updates, while still remaining true to the original experience its most dedicated fans have come to expect. WoW appeals to a range of playstyles (offering both PvE and PvP gameplay), and is the perfect option for both experienced and new MMORPG players due to its leveling system. With a whole episode of South Park devoted to it, it&#39;s hard to deny the cultural impact WoW has had on video games.



 Best Game Of 2005: Guitar Hero 
Rhythm
          

Gaming peripherals and add-ons were a lot more commonplace in the early 2000s, and wielding a large plastic guitar in order to play the latest AAA hit was no big ask in 2005. Guitar Hero took the world by storm, quickly becoming a fan-favorite rhythm game even for those who weren&#39;t too interested in video games as a whole. The title spawned multiple sequels, as well as spin-offs in both Rock Band and DJ Hero. A Guitar Hero reboot may well be launching in the future, as teased by Activision&#39;s Bobby Kotick.






 Best Game Of 2006: Wii Sports 
Party
          

   Wii Sports      Platform(s)    Wii     Released    November 19, 2006     Developer(s)    Nintendo     Publisher(s)    Nintendo      

The Wii is Nintendo&#39;s second best-selling home console of all time, surpassed only by the Switch. This meant that - as the game included with all new Nintendo Wii consoles - Wii Sports quickly gained a huge following. Designed to show off what the Wii&#39;s motion controls were really capable of, Wii Sports became more than just a tech demo and still serves as a reminder of one of the best party games ever released, providing competitive family fun across a variety of sports.



 Best Game Of 2007: Halo 3 
First-Person Shooter
          




   Halo 3      Franchise    Halo     Platform(s)    Xbox One , Xbox 360 , PC     Released    September 25, 2007     Developer(s)    Bungie     Publisher(s)    Xbox Game Studios      

Perhaps the pinnacle of the Halo, 2007&#39;s Halo 3 set a new standard for the series and is still considered one of the best releases in the franchise to date. With the introduction of new modes like Forge, new vehicles and weapons, and unforgettable campaigns like The Ark and The Covenant, Halo 3 was the perfect finale to the original trilogy. Halo hasn&#39;t quite met the same lofty heights since then, with 2021&#39;s Halo Infinite marred in controversy.



 Best Game Of 2008: GTA 4 
Action/Adventure
         

   Grand Theft Auto 4      Franchise    Grand Theft Auto     Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360     Released    April 29, 2008     Developer(s)    Rockstar North     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games      




Rockstar Games is known for its immersive releases, and Grand Theft Auto 4 is no exception. GTA 5 might be the game synonymous with the developer, but its predecessor laid the foundations for a lot of what made 5 so successful. GTA 4 has less of the over-the-top action, but much more of the heart, with memorable characters and what&#39;s generally accepted as the best storyline in the GTA franchise. It&#39;s rumored that a remaster was canceled to pour more resources into GTA 6.



 Best Game Of 2009: Batman Arkham Asylum 
Action/Adventure
         

   Batman: Arkham Asylum      Franchise    Batman , Batman: Arkham     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 3 , Xbox One , Xbox 360 , PC     Released    August 25, 2009     Developer(s)    Rocksteady Studios     Publisher(s)    Warner Bros. Games , Square Enix      

The Batman: Arkham series revolutionized combat with its fluid and adaptive movements, and its influences can still be seen in new releases even more than a decade on. Arkham Asylum stands as one of the best superhero games of all time, spawning multiple sequels and even a VR title. Developer Rocksteady is once again returning to the world of Batman with 2024&#39;s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, which will hopefully live up to the games that came before it.




                  Suicide Squad: KTJL Doesn’t Realize What Made Batman: Arkham So Great   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is developed by Batman: Arkham creator Rocksteady, but the shooter looks to fall short of its predecessors.   



 Best Game Of 2010: Red Dead Redemption 
Action/Adventure
         

   Red Dead Redemption      Franchise    Red Dead Redemption     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360     Released    May 18, 2010     Developer(s)    Rockstar San Diego     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games      

Red Dead Redemption 2 is often a front-runner when it comes to Best Games of All Time lists and polls, but its 2010 predecessor Red Dead Redemption is just as important a release. Following the character of John Marston, RDR truly embraced the Wild West in its design, themes, and music. While its sequel went on to perfect everything RDR set out to do, the first Redemption game raised the bar for Rockstar. Now available on Nintendo Switch, there&#39;s never been a better time to play it.






 Best Game Of 2011: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 
RPG
         

   The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim      Franchise    The Elder Scrolls     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Microsoft Windows     Released    November 11, 2011     Developer(s)    Bethesda     Publisher(s)    Bethesda      

There&#39;s little to be said about The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim that hasn&#39;t been said before, but that doesn&#39;t stop it from being one of the best games of the last 20 years. While it&#39;s become a meme just how many times Bethesda has re-released Skyrim in the years since its 2011 launch, there&#39;s good reason for it, as the game has amassed millions of adoring fans. With its massive and densely-populated world, it&#39;s possible to spend hundreds of hours in Skyrim and still have lots to explore, making it one of the most impressive sandbox games ever.






 Best Game Of 2012: Journey 
Adventure
          

Thatgamecompany&#39;s Journey is a short but beautifully sweet story that follows a nameless protagonist traveling through various harsh and empty landscapes to reach a distant mountain. Playable solo or with random online encounters, Journey&#39;s heart lies in its ability to forge friendships with others - despite only being able to communicate in singular musical notes. Perhaps the most beautiful game of the early 2010s and with an unforgettable score from Austin Wintory, Journey is well-deserving of its high praise.

                  Journey: Austin Wintory Interview   Celebrating Journey’s ten-year anniversary, composer Austin Wintory discusses scoring the game and reworking his original music into a new album.   






 Best Game Of 2013: GTA 5 
Action/Adventure
         

   Grand Theft Auto 5      Franchise    Grand Theft Auto     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , PC     Released    September 17, 2013     Developer(s)    Rockstar Games     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games      

The second best-selling game of all time (bested only by Minecraft), GTA 5 redefined what it means to be a financial success in video games and cemented Rockstar as one of the biggest developers in the sphere. The game follows crooks Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips, and Franklin Clinton as they navigate the criminal underworld of San Andreas. GTA 5 celebrated its 10th anniversary this year with little fanfare, as Rockstar now seems to be pouring everything it has into the development of GTA 6.



 Best Game Of 2014: Mario Kart 8 
Racing

 




Before its Switch re-release as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the original Mario Kart 8 became the best way to experience everything the long-standing series had been building towards for years. Mario Kart 8 is a much pared-down version compared to Deluxe, but it still shone brightly as one of the best games of the year. Unfortunately, being on one of Nintendo&#39;s least-successful home consoles ever, few people experienced 8 until the Deluxe version released in 2017. Deluxe is now the best-selling Switch game of all time, building further upon what made 8 great.



 Best Game Of 2015: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt 
RPG
          

   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt      Franchise    The Witcher     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , Nintendo Switch , Microsoft Windows , Steam , Epic Games Store     Released    May 19, 2015     Developer(s)    CD Projekt Red     Publisher(s)    CD Projekt     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Open-World      




When it comes to the best RPGs ever released, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is definitely up there. It&#39;s rare for the third game in a series to be most players&#39; entry point, but the success of Wild Hunt introduced millions of players to Geralt and his companions in the quest to defeat the Wild Hunt. Taking a vastly different direction to its predecessors, The Witcher 3 focuses more on the world and story than combat, providing hundreds of hours of entertainment and winning Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2015.



 Best Game Of 2016: Stardew Valley 
Farming/RPG
          

   Stardew Valley      Platform(s)    Xbox One , Android , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation Vita , iOS , PC , Linux , Nintendo Switch , macOS     Released    February 26, 2016     Developer(s)    ConcernedApe     Publisher(s)    Chucklefish     Genre(s)    Simulation , RPG      




The pioneer of what&#39;s now known as the cozy genre, Stardew Valley took the basics of the beloved Harvest Moon series and elevated every aspect. From solo developer Eric Barone, Stardew Valley isn&#39;t just the perfect management and farming sim - it&#39;s also a masterclass in game design, as well as an inspirational tale for budding game developers the world over. Stardew continues to receive game updates to introduce new content, and proves that indie games can be just as important as AAA titles.



 Best Game Of 2017: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
Action/Adventure
          

   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild      Franchise    The Legend of Zelda     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    March 3, 2017     Developer(s)    Nintendo EPD     Publisher(s)    Nintendo      

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild needs little introduction as the best-selling Zelda of all time, and the game that revolutionized open-word game design. Even years after its release, players are still discovering new BOTW secrets, and it&#39;s still something of a mystery how such a large and beautiful game could even run on the Switch hardware. BOTW had an unmissable impact on game design, with plenty of new releases taking inspiration from its impressive world and play-it-your-way combat.






 Best Game Of 2018: Red Dead Redemption 2 
Action/Adventure
          

   Red Dead Redemption 2      Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Microsoft Windows , Stadia     Released    October 26, 2018     Developer(s)    Rockstar Studios     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games      

Almost every aspect of Red Dead Redemption was improved upon with its 2018 sequel, and despite now being half a decade old, RDR2 is still widely regarded as one of the best video games ever made. RDR2 players embark on an unforgettable journey as Arthur Morgan, experiencing its stunning landscapes and gut-wrenchingly sad story - one that truly sets a new standard for narrative storytelling in a game. While there&#39;s no RDR3 yet confirmed by Rockstar, it seems inevitable that the saga won&#39;t end here.



 Best Game Of 2019: Disco Elysium 
RPG
          




   Disco Elysium      Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , macOS     Released    October 15, 2019     Developer(s)    ZA/UM     Publisher(s)    ZA/UM      

Disco Elysium is still regarded as one of the best indie games of all time thanks to its beautiful art style, deep and rich storytelling, and masterful game design. One of the most memorable aspects of the game is its characters, with its many NPCs feeling very much like real people thanks to the countless dialogue options and interactions the player can have with them. It&#39;s best to go into Disco Elysium knowing as little as possible, but it&#39;s certainly worth a playthrough thanks to its unignorable impact on gaming as a whole.



 Best Game Of 2020: The Last of Us Part 2 
Action/Adventure
          




   The Last of Us Part 2      Franchise    The Last of Us     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4     Released    June 19, 2020     Developer(s)    Naughty Dog     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment      

As the sequel to one of the greatest PlayStation exclusives of all time, The Last of Us Part 2 had a lot to live up to when it released in 2020. The game divided the fanbase with its controversial decision to kill off a main character, and story leaks in the run-up to launch led many to turn their backs on the game. Despite this, TLOU2 won TGA 2020&#39;s Game of the Year Award and racked up countless other accolades for developer Naughty Dog. A PS5 remaster is now rumored to be in the works.



 Best Game Of 2021: Forza Horizon 5 
Racing
          

   Forza Horizon 5      Franchise    Forza Horizon     Platform(s)    Xbox Series X , Xbox One , PC     Released    November 9, 2021     Developer(s)    Playground Games     Publisher(s)    Xbox Game Studios      




The Forza Horizon games aren&#39;t just perfect for racing fans - they&#39;re also staple games for anyone who enjoys exploring breathtakingly realistic worlds that really show off the power of the current gaming generation. Forza Horizon 5 takes races to Mexico, featuring beautiful jungles as well as sprawling cities. The graphics are certainly a step up from its critically acclaimed predecessor, and Forza Horizon 5 earned a near-perfect review score from Screen Rant.



 Best Game Of 2022: Elden Ring 
Action/Adventure
         

   Elden Ring      Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    February 25, 2022     Developer(s)    FromSoftware     Publisher(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment     Genre(s)    Action , RPG      

FromSoftware&#39;s Elden Ring brought together the genius of Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, resulting in an unforgettable experience that surpassed expectations and earned itself the title of The Game Awards 2022 Game of the Year. Elden Ring is arguably the first FromSoft title to garner mainstream appeal, which is no easy feat considering its tough and difficult-to-master gameplay. The title is confirmed to be getting DLC titled Shadow of the Erdtree, though no release date is confirmed.






 Best Game Of 2023: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
RPG
         

   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3      Franchise    Baldur&#39;s Gate     Platform(s)    macOS , Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5     Released    August 31, 2023     Developer(s)    Larian Studios     Publisher(s)    Larian Studios      

2023 has been packed with GOTY contenders, including Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and Starfield. However, Screen Rant has to give our Best Game of 2023 to none other than Larian&#39;s Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. BG3 has kept players entertained for months after its initial launch, offering plenty of reasons to jump back into the game after beating it. From its wonderful gameplay to its fantastic script and game design, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is by far our favorite release of the year.
