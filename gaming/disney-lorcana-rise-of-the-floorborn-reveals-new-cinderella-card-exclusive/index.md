## Literature Review

Screen Rant reveals a new Disney Princess card coming to Disney Lorcana’s second set, Rise of the Floodborn, and she’s a true Ballroom Sensation.




Disney&#39;s captivating new trading card game, Disney Lorcana, is nearing the release of its second set titled Rise of the Floodborn. The collectible and competitive card game allows glimmers of familiar Disney characters a chance to save the world of Lorcana with the help of players acting as Illumineers to guide the battle and hunt for lore. Some of the most beloved Disney princesses are already among the catalog of card choices for questing or challenging opponents, and now another take on the classic Cinderella is joining the fray.




Thanks to Ravensburger, Screen Rant can exclusively reveal the new Cinderella card, titled Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation, that will be joining the Amber ink deck when Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn debuts later this month. This second set for the game continues to reveal the mysterious story behind what happened to the previous Illumineers and how to save the lore of Lorcana. Cinderella previously appeared with one card in The First Chapter and has had two additional cards for Rise of the Floodborn already announced before this reveal. None of those are quite as classic as this iconic imagery, however, of the princess stepping from her pumpkin carriage.

          

This Disney Lorcana card art by Casey Robin displays the traditional look of Cinderella in her magical ballgown with twinkling lights around her. It is aptly titled Ballroom Sensation as it evokes the memories of scenes with Cinderella impressing the Prince and everyone else present at the royal ball. It is truly one of the most definitive images of a Disney princess.




                  Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards   Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is releasing soon, with new cards arriving via Illumineer&#39;s Troves, Gift Sets, and more in this second set.

Cinderella&#39;s Ballroom Sensation card for Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is a part of the Amber deck, and represents the princess as a Storyborn Hero. Unlike the Floodborn or Dreamborn cards, a Storyborn card is the most basic of glimmer classifications and represents the most traditional form of a character. As such, they can often also be fairly weak cards, such as this example where Cinderella only has an attack power of one, and a defense of two. When questing, she only gains one lore.

Despite this, it is still a very useful card to have, as it only costs one ink to play, or can be turned into ink, and can count as a cost of three to sing songs. This is a particularly useful power for Amber decks, as it could allow players to use the fan-favorite cost-three Song card, Part Of Your World, much earlier in the game. Cinderella Ballroom Sensation is a Rare card, denoted by the bronze triangle at the base of the card.






Having this Cinderella card in play can also allow for a cheaper placement of the powerful Floodborn card Stouthearted Cinderella, which is in the Steel deck.




Rise of the Floodborn is set to arrive at local game stores on November 17, 2023, with a wider release on December 1, but if The First Chapter was any indication, cards may be difficult to come by. Since its release this summer, Disney Lorcana has proven exceptionally difficult to purchase, as the amount of cards made available was drastically lower than the demand for the game. Hopefully, this will be corrected with Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn, and many Illumineers will be able to bring Cinderella on quests in the future.
