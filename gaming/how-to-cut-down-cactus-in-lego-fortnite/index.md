## Literature Review

To cut down Cactus in LEGO Fortnite, players must use the upgraded Rare Forest Axe. Crafting this item requires several rare crafting resources.





The first step you will need to take is to find the Dry Valley desert biome. Unlike Fortnite’s main Battle Royale mode, which has great seasonal landing spots and landmarks, LEGO Fortnite’s worlds are all procedurally generated. You’ll eventually need to find the Dry Valley to progress, but due to random generation, finding it is a matter of luck.

 How To Cut Down Cactus Plants In LEGO Fortnite 
          

To cut down Cactus Plants, you’ll need the Rare quality Forest Axe. The crafting recipe is only available on a Crafting Bench that’s been upgraded twice and requires 5 Cut Amber and 3 Knotwood Rods.

          

To upgrade the Crafting Bench, you will need the right resources:

  8 Planks and 3 Shells for the first upgrade.   12 Knotwood Rods, 15 Marble Slabs, 6 Sand Claws, and 3 Sand Shells for the second upgrade.  




Knotwood Rods can be refined from Knotwood using the Lumber Mill, while Sand Claws and Sand Shells drop from defeated Sand Wolves and Sand Rollers. These dangerous creatures spawn all over the Dry Valley biome, so make sure you have the right weapons to take them down.

          

Cut Amber is harder to obtain. Rough Amber can be mined from mineral veins in the Dry Valley with an Uncommon quality Pickaxe. It can then be refined into Cut Amber using a Gem Cutter, which requires extra resources:

  20 Marble Slabs   5 Rough Amber   5 Sand Claws   3 Sand Shells  

With an upgraded Crafting Bench, Cut Amber, and Knotwood Rods, you should be able to cut down Cactus plants.
