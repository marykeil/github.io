                  How to Increase Your Profit Factor in Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader   Profit Factor determines what you can and cannot purchase from vendors in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, so increasing it is in your best interests.   


 How to Defeat Chaos Marine Aurora in Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader 
          

The most important strategies for defeating Aurora are to position your characters away from each other before the battle starts, and to take out the Chaos Marine&#39;s minions quickly. The boss will use many devastating Area of Effect (AoE) attacks in Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader. This means that you need to place your team in far apart positions in the initial round you have to prepare for the upcoming fight.



The arena where you fight Chaos Marine Aurora has different spots where your characters can be placed behind cover. Organize your team in protected spaces at first to minimize the chances of them getting hit by enemies.







Aurora will summon Chaos Cultists to the battlefield that you need to deal with fast to reduce the pressure of multiple enemies. The most dangerous of these minions is a Sniper who is located at the back of the map in an elevated position. Use long-rank weapons or Argenta&#39;s Run and Gun ability to deal with this target before they can pick off any of your companions in Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader.

Buff your allies and inflict bleeding status on Aurora to maximize the DPS you can inflict on the boss with various abilities. Exploit whatever weaknesses you can, and keep in mind that Aurora may be more powerful if you are playing Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader on a higher difficulty. Troops like Cassia can be very strong against Aurora with skills that let them apply buffs to your other soldiers.

You have to start off strong for this fight to make sure your team has everything they need to wear Aurora down. Try to lock the boss down, and remember that you can save before the fight to reload back to the beginning if you get some bad luck. As long as you don&#39;t let the boss&#39; AoE attacks hit every member of your squad, you should be able to eventually drop their health to 0.




If you manage to beat Chaos Marine Aurora in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader without letting any of the three shuttles in the boss arena get destroyed, you will earn extra rewards for victory.
