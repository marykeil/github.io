## Literature Review

Unorthodox allies like spiders can be spawned to aid your party in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and fight for you alongside companions during tough battles.





The Spider Egg Sac is a hidden Miscellaneous item you can discover at coordinates (X: 138, Y: 365) at the Harper Outpost in the Roadside Cliffs area. Climbing a ladder into this space lets characters in your party do a Perception check to try and see this landmark. A highlighted rock revealed by a high roll can be interacted with, giving you a chance to collect the Egg Sac in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.






The character who investigates the spider-infested rock has to pass multiple Nature and Investigation checks to successfully grab the Egg Sac. Feel free to use Guidance or another spell to boost your chances of passing each roll.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 1   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is hiding boss encounters, powerful armor, weapons, cutscenes, and companions as long as the party knows where to look.    


 How To Summon Friendly Spiders in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

When you throw the Spider Egg Sac or destroy it while it is on the ground, it summons five friendly crag spiders as companions until your next long rest. This Consumable item can only be used once before being destroyed forever in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. You can throw the Sac as a bonus action if you are in combat already, but you may want to unleash the spiders beforehand.




Placing the Sac on the ground and shooting it with an arrow will release the spiders without injuring them. Make sure to only do this when your party is healthy or when you immediately leave camp after a long rest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The spiders will leave your party permanently when you long rest again, so take advantage of these allies while they last.

  

Crag Spiders are Level 1 Beasts with a Bite attack that deals 1d4 - 1 piercing damage to targets they hit. Any creature with a spider&#39;s strike must make a DC 9 Constitution Saving Throw or take an additional 1d4 of poison damage. While this may not seem like much, having five spiders with these attacks on your side can quickly stack up injuries on your enemies in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Best Companion Isn&#39;t A Companion At All   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a strong variety of distinct companion characters, but they aren&#39;t the only ones worth inviting to the party in the campaign.   




Even though the spiders you spawn to fight for you in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 only have 9 AC and 6 HP, they could be the deciding factor between your party&#39;s victory or defeat.
