## Literature Review

Solving November 9th’s Wordle answer shouldn’t be too much trouble if players use contextual hints that give a fair idea of the solution.





Many players tend to get carried away when using random words in the hopes of discovering the correct position of a few letters. This strategy might work in the first few attempts but isn’t helpful in the long run. However, if you use Wordle’s hard mode, you have a better chance of solving the puzzle without sacrificing your daily streak.
