## Literature Review

Now that EA isn&#39;t the sole proprietor of Star Wars games, there are plenty of titles in development for fans to look forward to in 2024 and beyond.




Just like the films, Star Wars video games are almost always highly anticipated, and luckily, there are already some games lined up to look forward to in 2024 and beyond. George Lucas&#39; creation has blossomed over decades into one of the largest media franchises in existence, with classic games like Knights of the Old Republic and Battlefront standing as important contributions. Following Disney&#39;s acquisition of the Star Wars IP, Electronic Arts was the sole publisher allowed to release officially licensed games. That is no longer the case, and other companies have joined the roster of upcoming titles.
There are eight Star Wars games that appear to be in development, although the field of titles that are actually likely to release in 2024 is comparatively scarce. Currently, there are only two Star Warsgames confirmed with a 2024 release window, with the others essentially only having a single trailer or nothing more than an announcement. There could be some surprises in the coming months, but the franchise, for now, appears to have a relatively shallow output of games as other developers have only just gotten started on several titles now that Star Wars is free of EA&#39;s control.

 8  Star Wars Outlaws Is The Next Big Star Wars Game 
Massive Entertainment


 







  Star Wars Outlaws  


  Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Developer(s)    Massive Entertainment     Publisher(s)    Ubisoft     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , Open-World ,  Sci-Fi    


Star Wars Outlaws is the first upcoming AAA project on the horizon for the galaxy far, far away, currently set for a release in 2024. This title is in development at Ubisoft subsidiary Massive Entertainment, which is responsible for both Tom Clancy&#39;s The Division games and the recent Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It&#39;s currently being billed as the first open-world Star Wars game, and it certainly looks to be the most expansive singleplayer experience in terms of sheer scale, with freely explorable environments spanning a number of confirmed planets.
Star Wars Outlaws is taking a very different tack from a game like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, focusing on the galactic scoundrel side of things rather than anyone who&#39;s ever held the right to wield a lightsaber. The combat is consequently blaster-centric, while other aspects of gameplay include stealth possibilities, speeder bike chases, and spaceflight. The story takes place during the Original Trilogy, sliding into the gap between the major plot points in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.





 7  Star Wars Hunters Is A 2024 Mobile Release 
Zynga


 







Star Wars: Hunters was announced in early 2021 and originally expected sometime in the same year, but was later pushed to a 2022 window, then 2023, and ultimately to 2024. So far, there has not been any official word from developer Zynga on any sort of release window within that, although the game is being tested on mobile devices in some parts of the world. Hunters is an arena fighter coming to Nintendo Switch and mobile devices, and it will pit players against each other in teams comprised of a variety of characters. Wookies, Jawas, droids, Stormtroopers, and even a new Dark Side user named Rieve are slated to be included as playable characters.
The gameplay of Star Wars: Hunters appears to take inspiration from hero shooters, though lightsaber wielders will bring a decent amount of melee combat to the game. The experience is set in-universe, with the game taking place between the original and sequel trilogies. The gameplay represents a sort of spectated gladiatorial competition, providing team-based multiplayer battles that can be waged with friends or random online players for high stakes and glory.





 6  Star Wars Eclipse Could Be As Late As 2026 
Quantic Dream
        

Star Wars Eclipse was announced with a captivating reveal trailer at The Game Awards 2021. It will be the first Star Wars game set in the High Republic era, which is a period of prosperity for the Galactic Republic decades prior to the events of The Phantom Menace. Very little is known about the game itself since it isn&#39;t expected to release for a few more years. Star Wars Eclipse is being developed by Quantic Dream, a studio known for its interactive story-driven games and a number of controversies relating to a toxic work environment.
Eclipse came under scrutiny following its announcement because of Quantic Dream&#39;s involvement, which resulted in #BlackoutStarWarsEclipse trending on Twitter. Many fans feel the lucrative Star Wars IP shouldn&#39;t be licensed to creators prone to repeated, troubling behavior, but the situation hasn&#39;t necessarily evolved since the outcry. Rumors have suggested that some of these issues could put the game a long way off, potentially as far as 2026.





 5  Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic Is In Flux 
Saber Interactive


 







Longtime Star Wars video game fans were delighted when a remake of Knights of the Old Republic was announced at Sony&#39;s PlayStation Showcase in September 2021. The original, developed by BioWare, came out for the Xbox and PC in 2003 and has since become one of the most beloved RPGs ever to be released. An equally lauded sequel was developed by Obsidian in 2005, but a third KOTOR never came. Fans waited a long time for the series to return to the light of day, and although concrete news of a new title would have been hard to beat, a remake of the original is still a welcome surprise.
Only a teaser for the remake featuring Darth Revan igniting a red lightsaber has been released, with all other details on the KOTOR remake still a mystery. Reports of a change in developer for the KOTOR remake from Aspyr to Saber Interactive worried fans about the state of the game, and a tweet from 2023 revealed an exchange with the CEO of the company behind Saber, Stephen Totilo, that offers little hope for an imminent release. Despite various other scares, like a delisted KOTOR remake trailer, rumors continue to show vague signs of life in the project. Those interested may want to check out the fantastic RPG in the recent KOTOR Nintendo Switch port, which was developed by Aspyr.







 4  A Third Star Wars Jedi Game Is In The Works 
Respawn Entertainment
        

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor followed up its predecessor Fallen Order, as a hit, and it looks like that momentum won&#39;t be stopping any time soon. VGC reported on a comment that Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan made at Ocala Comic Con referring to work being done on a third game. This isn&#39;t a definitive statement in the way that an announcement from Respawn or EA would be, but it would seem to confirm that some form of progress is being made on the title, whether that&#39;s pre-production or active development.

 3  Respawn&#39;s Star Wars FPS Is Likely Years Away 
Respawn Entertainment
        

When it was first revealed that a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was in the works, the information was accompanied by the news that Respawn has two other Star Wars projects in the works, one of which is a first-person shooter. Although Star Wars Jedi: Survivor released in 2023, this untitled Star Wars FPS is likely years away from release. Electronic Arts&#39; press release revealed that the director for this title will be Peter Hirschmann, previously involved in games like the original Battlefront series and The Force Unleashed. This is unlikely to be a continuation of the modern Battlefront series, which is developed by DICE, especially since Battlefront 3 was reportedly canceled over licensing costs.





 2  Respawn Is Leading A Star Wars Strategy Game 
Respawn Entertainment/Bit Reactor
        

Respawn&#39;s other untitled Star Wars project will be a strategy game and is a collaborative effort with a newly formed development studio called Bit Reactor. Just like the FPS, this game is probably years away from release, with its early announcement part of a hiring strategy. EA claims Bit Reactor will take the lead in development since Greg Foertsch, a former employee of Firaxis Games, helms the studio. Foertsch has experience working on Firaxis&#39; XCOM series, so it&#39;s plausible that this upcoming Star Wars title will be a turn-based or tactical strategy game rather than an RTS.
            
 
 20 Best Star Wars Games 
Star Wars has a long catalog of video games, but there are a handful of especially great titles that are still must-plays for fans.








 1  Amy Hennig Has A Star Wars Project 
Skydance New Media
        

A new Star Wars game by Amy Hennig was announced to be in early development at Skydance New Media. Hennig is best known for her work as creative director and writer of the first three Uncharted games, but was notably attached to a separate Star Wars project at Visceral Games before the studio was shuttered by Electronic Arts. Her upcoming title could draw from that prior Star Wars experience while borrowing elements of Uncharted&#39;s characters and gameplay, both highly regarded in the general sphere of gaming.
This untitled project marks the second marquee game in development at Skydance New Media, alongside another title in development for Marvel. The new studio was only formed in 2019 and has yet to release a game, but Hennig and other AAA development talent have attracted some of the most coveted IP in multimedia entertainment. Like many other upcoming Star Wars titles, details on the game remain almost nonexistent. With Hennig&#39;s portfolio, however, it is expected to be a narrative-heavy, fairly linear experience and hopefully a successful flagship for the Star Warsgames coming in 2024 and beyond.
