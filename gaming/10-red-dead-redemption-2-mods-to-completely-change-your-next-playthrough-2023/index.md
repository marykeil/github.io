## Literature Review

Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t the newest game, but with the help of mods, your next playthrough can feel completely different from the past.




Red Dead Redemption 2 has been available for a few years now, but that doesn&#39;t mean that a new playthrough can&#39;t feel fresh. The modding community is active and continues releasing new mods while updating old ones. As a result, RDR2 can be made into an entirely different game by installing select mods.
The creativity of modding communities, and their dedication to pumping out content even years after a game&#39;s release, never fails to impress. There&#39;s no shortage of mods to choose from for RDR2, but mods that implement substantial changes and were added in 2023 may be the most useful.
            
 
 Red Dead Redemption 2: 9 Best Things to Do After Beating The Game 
Even after the end of Red Dead Redemption 2, there are plenty of things to do after beating the game that expand upon the best parts of the Wild West.












 








 10  Western Iron Man (Red Parrot) 
Models And Textures


 







Western Iron Man by Red Parrot answers the question of what if Iron Man was the main character of RDR2. This game has plenty of serious moments and a few humorous ones, but this mod changes the atmosphere a lot. Even better, this version of Iron Man looks like the Black Knight from Monty Python was mixed with a Dark Souls character. It should make for a unique playthrough, at the very least.
            
 
 All 19 Red Dead Redemption 2 Horses, Ranked From Worst To Best 
Each horse in RDR2 has pros and cons, and so Arthur must take care to choose wisely. Here&#39;s a breakdown of all 19 horse breeds and how they perform.








 9  Peaceful Frontier (Aturovidal009) 
Quality-Of-Life
        

Peaceful Frontier by aturovidal009 doesn&#39;t make the frontier start off peaceful. However, once a gang is defeated, they don&#39;t keep respawning. Not only is this a nice quality-of-life improvement, but it makes it feel like a difference is being made by clearing out gangs and then not seeing them come back to life repeatedly due to respawns.
            
 
 Red Dead Redemption 2: The Best Outfits and What They Do 
Here is a guide to the best outfits in Red Dead Redemption 2 along with how to get them and what they can do for you in the Wild West open-world epic.








 8  Toast&#39;s Restored Pedestrian Pack (AClassySliceOfToast) 
Models And Textures


 







Not everything makes it into the end product of a game, but it&#39;s often possible to restore cut content with the use of mods. AClassySliceOfToast created Toast&#39;s Restored Pedestrian Pack to restore elements of minor NPCs from textures to outfits to whole characters. Toast estimates that this mod affects around 100 characters, so the game should feel more alive, and even old characters can feel new with a different outfit and look.

 7  Bandit Hideouts (Gunter Severloh) 
Gameplay
        

In case it feels like there aren&#39;t enough bandits to fight, Gunter Severloh created a mod to add even more bandits. According to the description, this mod adds 95 hideout locations, 20 ambush locations, roaming bandits, and bandits on horseback. Then, there&#39;s the ability to hire gunmen at saloons. And, of course, the addition of zombies to the game.





 6  Terrain Textures Overhaul (Nigeez) 
Models And Textures
        

Making a game feel new again doesn&#39;t require adding new content or making major changes to mechanics. Sometimes, it&#39;s enough to upgrade the environmental quality, and that&#39;s what Nigeez does with this mod. The areas where the main story of RDR2 have been remade in this mod to increase the terrain textures&#39; quality, and that&#39;s more than enough to make the next playthrough fresh.





 5  Jobs - Expanded And Enhanced (Shtivi) 
Scripts
        

Job boards provide a way to make money without affecting one&#39;s reputation negatively. While they&#39;re part of the regular game, Shtivi took on the task of adding to the available jobs and enhancing the existing ones to create more opportunities to make money legally in the old west. These jobs are available from job boards in each city, and they range from being a chauffeur to being a ranch hand and pest control. Not only does this change part of the game, it adds content that could make a new playthrough even longer than previous ones.





 4  Ambient Random Events (Crossed99) 
Gameplay
        

Red Dead Redemption 2 already feels fairly alive, but this mod by Crossed99 adds to that by implementing random events happening in the area around the character. The random events are limited to bounty hunters trying to catch a target, a fistfight, and shootouts, but the events can end differently, such as the bounty hunter&#39;s target escaping or which group wins a fight. To add to the ambiance of life that comes with this mod, the events aren&#39;t always close to the character, in which case it could be nothing more than sounds of a fight in the distance. It doesn&#39;t change the game in a huge way, but it changes enough to make the game feel different in that it&#39;s more alive.
            
 
 How To Get The Fastest Horse In Red Dead Redemption 2 
It can be a drag to explore the Wild West on the wrong steed, but thankfully, getting the fastest horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 solves this problem.








 3  Cut Dialogue Enhanced (Milferino) 
Gameplay
        

This is another mod that restores cut content, but this time, it&#39;s in the form of dialogue lines for Arthur and John. Milferino adds lines that were previously unused, and that means the next playthrough includes more content because it restored dialogue to the game. The result is that Arthur and John will rarely repeat lines with this mod, and anticipating lines that weren&#39;t in the game before can change the experience. There&#39;s another mod that&#39;s similar, but Cut Dialogue Enhanced builds on it, meaning it contains the content of Cut Dialogue Restoration and Enhancement while adding more dialogue not restored in the latter mod.





 2  Serenity (MaybelleElizabethColter) 
Gameplay
        

Many small changes can be enough to make a game feel completely different, and that&#39;s what LittleCDumpster does with Serenity. This mod changes prompts when a character is near water and includes other features like removing the graze distance so horses are more likely to graze near the character. Plus, grazing restores the horse&#39;s health, so it&#39;s a nice way - and easier - to keep them in top shape.

RDR2’s ending is devastating no matter what, but doing something nice just for Arthur can help soften the blow. Here are a few ways to say goodbye.








 1  Chaos Mod (Shdel) 
Scripts


 







Shdel&#39;s Chaos Mod was released in 2022, but it makes Red Dead Redemption 2 unpredictable in ways that no other mod matches. It is also a great option for streamers since it lets Twitch viewers vote on which effect happens to the streamer next. The effects are game-changing because they can be highly inconvenient to the point that it feels like a new game. Effects include being kidnapped by pig farmers, making the character drunk, taking away the character&#39;s ammo, and so many more. Each effect lasts 45 seconds, and it creates a fun time when you want to play RDR2 in a new, challenging way.
Modding communities provide tons of content for their favorite games, and it can range from quality-of-life improvements to changes meant to be silly and humorous, like the Chaos Mod. Games like RDR2 are perfect for modding with the amount of content the base game has along with the huge world it features. That&#39;s why, when it&#39;s time to hop into the shoes of Arthur Morgan again, adding a few mods can make the next Red Dead Redemption 2 playthrough unique.
