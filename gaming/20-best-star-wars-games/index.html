  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Star Wars has a long catalog of video games, but there are a handful of especially great titles that are still must-plays for fans.</p>
<p>Even from its earliest years, the monumental Star Wars franchise has extended to video games. Although its nascent arcade offerings are humble compared to modern games, even some older Star Wars games are classics worth playing. Star Wars may be best known for its blockbuster films, but the franchise&rsquo;s video game sector has been far more prolific, and the medium offers a level of interactivity that can&rsquo;t be matched. The galaxy far, far away captures the imagination like few fictional settings can manage, and games allow players a wide range of in-universe experiences, including dueling with lightsabers, piloting a starfighter, and marching into the battles of the Clone Wars.
Following Disney&rsquo;s purchase of Lucasfilm – and by extension, the Star Wars brand – in 2012, an exclusive license to publish games for the franchise was granted to Electronic Arts. While a tighter grip on the IP was par for the course in Disney&rsquo;s early years at the helm, there were noticeably fewer Star Wars games being released compared to the deluge that came out of the now-defunct LucasArts prior. With EA&rsquo;s exclusive license now expired, more variety is on the horizon, including Ubisoft&rsquo;s truly open-world Star Wars Outlaws, but newer Star Wars games, playable on modern hardware, are surprisingly few and far between. Luckily, even many retro titles contain the best storytelling in all of Star Wars.
How we choose entries for our Best-Of LIsts.
Screen Rant has taken into consideration the aggregate of critic scores via Metacritic, user reviews from Steam, and Screen Rant&rsquo;s own reviews. Screen Rant has been critically analyzing and evaluating media for over two decades, and has a particularly keen focus on the Star Wars franchise at large. Alongside certain older titles&rsquo; legacies, audience expectations of what makes an exceptionally great Star Wars game have also been weighed, as well as the merits of both gameplay and story as it pertains to game.</p>
<p>20  Star Wars: TIE Fighter (1994)
Space Combat</p>
<p>Star Wars: TIE Fighter is a sequel to 1993&rsquo;s Star Wars: X-Wing, flipping the player&rsquo;s allegiance to Empire, putting them in the cockpit of seven different Imperial starships (when counting those included in TIE Fighter&rsquo;s two expansions). TIE Fighter&rsquo;s main campaign primarily takes place between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, commencing shortly after the Battle of Hoth and ending prior to the Battle of Endor. Although dated visually, TIE Fighter&rsquo;s lauded gameplay still holds up relatively well, and appearances from the likes of Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, Mon Mothma, and then-Vice Admiral Thrawn give its story significantly engaging stakes.

<p>19  Star Wars: Dark Forces (1995)
First-Person Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars: Dark Forces</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation (Original)     Released    February 15, 1995     Developer(s)    LucasArts     Publisher(s)    LucasArts     Genre(s)    FPS , Shooter     ESRB    T</p>
<p>1995&rsquo;s Star Wars: Dark Forces may be a bit dated for modern audiences, but it&rsquo;s a watershed release for the franchise&rsquo;s earlier video games. It&rsquo;s the first Star Wars first-person shooter, but perhaps more importantly, it introduces Kyle Katarn, a beloved character of the now de-canonized Star Wars Expanded Universe (now referred to as Legends). Dark Forces mostly takes place after A New Hope, seeing reluctant mercenary Katarn uncovering the Galactic Empire&rsquo;s Dark Trooper program. While Dark Forces is readily available on PC through Steam, many interested players may want to wait for the upcoming remaster from Nightdive Studios, which is expected to release on all major platforms.

<p>18  Star Wars: Shadows Of The Empire (1996)
Third-Person Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    Nintendo 64 , PC     Released    December 3, 1996     Developer(s)    LucasArts     Publisher(s)    Nintendo , LucasArts     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , Third-Person Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire is another fairly dated game that can still be enjoyed on PC. Originally a Nintendo 64 game released in 1996, Shadows of the Empire is only one part of a larger multimedia project undertaken by Lucasfilm to fill in the gaps between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Starring Dash Rendar, the game begins with the Battle of Hoth but includes a multitude of storylines and a variety of gameplay. Primarily a third-person shooter, Shadows of the Empire does well to incorporate its original characters with those from the films, including Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and Lando.
Critic   Score    Steam   Mostly Positive</p>
<p>17  Star Wars Episode 1: Racer (1999)
Racing</p>
<p>Star Wars Episode 1: Racer</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    Dreamcast , Game Boy Color , macOS , Nintendo 64 , PC , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    May 18, 1999     Developer(s)    LucasArts     Publisher(s)    LucasArts , Nintendo , Aspyr , THQ Nordic     Genre(s)    Racing</p>
<p>Adapting one of the quintessential set pieces from The Phantom Menace, Star Wars Episode 1: Racer puts players in the pilot seat of a podracer. With high-speed racing gameplay akin to F-Zero, Racer includes the podracers Anakin faces on Tatooine in the movie (plus some additional, original characters), but includes tracks from all over the Star Wars galaxy. Though originally released in 1999, Racer has more recently been ported to more modern hardware, complete with the original console version&rsquo;s two-player split-screen capability.
Critic   Score    Metacritic   70    Steam   Very Positive</p>
<p>16  Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008)
Action-Adventure</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , Wii , PC , Xbox One , Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3     Released    September 16, 2008     Developer(s)    Lucasfilm Games , Aspyr     Publisher(s)    Aspyr     Genre(s)    Action</p>
<p>In some ways, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed epitomizes the way the franchise&rsquo;s video games danced around the stories of the mainline films, often creating characters and storylines that were unnecessary, but nonetheless captivating. The Force Unleashed (and its sequel) illuminates the rise of Starkiller, Darth Vader&rsquo;s secret apprentice between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. Prior to the Inquisitorius being created in the newer Star Wars canon, it was Starkiller&rsquo;s job to hunt down the Jedi who managed to survive the Great Jedi Purge.
A planet-hopping game with plenty of lightsaber dueling, The Force Unleashed was also important because of its Rebel Alliance origin story, which unveiled the machinations of a Darth Vader intent on overthrowing the Emperor. Unfortunately, The Force Unleashed&rsquo;s most recent version is a Nintendo Switch port of the motion-controlled Wii release, which doesn&rsquo;t translate very well to the Switch&rsquo;s Joy-Cons. Anyone hoping to enjoy the game now is likely better off opting for the PC version, or finding a copy to play on original console hardware.
Critic   Score    Screen Rant (Switch port)   2.5/5    Metacritic   73    Steam   Mostly Positive</p>
<p>15  Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002)
Action-Adventure, Third-Person Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter continued the tradition of the franchise&rsquo;s games filling in gaps between the mainline movies, providing context to Jango Fett&rsquo;s role in Attack of the Clones. The story has now been de-canonized as part of the Legends continuity, but has yet to see a replacement or re-telling. Bounty Hunter&rsquo;s plot revolves around Fett being hired by Count Dooku, aka Darth Tyranus - a job that evolves into a test to see if the bounty hunter is a suitable template for the clone army that will be created on Kamino.
Originally releasing on PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, Bounty Hunter may be a bit clunky by modern standards, but more than makes up for its lackluster elements with a captivating story and its novelty. So far, a game based on The Mandalorian is the stuff of dreams, and Bounty Hunter remains the closest in-universe substitute. Jango Fett remains an incredibly popular character alongside his cloned offspring, Boba, and Bounty Hunter gives players the pleasure of utilizing his dual blasters, jetpack, and wrist rockets.

<p>14  Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2 (1997)
Third-Person Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PC     Released    October 10, 1997     Developer(s)    LucasArts     Publisher(s)    LucasArts     Genre(s)    Action , First-Person Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2 is the direct sequel to Dark Forces, but contains a key turn for protagonist Kyle Katarn: the discovery of his connection to the Force. Dark Forces 2 starts out as an FPS much like its predecessor, but the player is quickly given access to a lightsaber and an array of Force powers for the remainder of the campaign. Taking place shortly after Return of the Jedi, the game takes Katarn on a deeply personal journey to confront the Dark Jedi that murdered his father. It&rsquo;s a fascinating evolution in both gameplay and story from its prequel, and introduces online multiplayer to the series.
Critic   Score    Metacritic   91    Steam   Mostly Positive</p>
<p>13  Star Wars: Battlefront (2004)
First/Third-Person Shooter</p>
<p>The original Star Wars: Battlefront is only limited by its scope. Released before Revenge of the Sith even hit theaters, Battlefront has a somewhat disjointed campaign, introducing battles via clips from the five then-released Star Wars films as the story progresses through the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. Despite feeling a little barebones by modern standards, the gameplay of 2004&rsquo;s Battlefront still holds up, and the Galactic Conquest and Instant Action modes provide plenty of variety and replayability.
Critic   Score    Metacritic   80    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive</p>
<p>12  Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017)
First/Third-Person Shooter, Space Combat</p>
<p>Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2017)</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PC     Released    November 17, 2017     Developer(s)    DICE     Publisher(s)    EA     Genre(s)    Adventure , Action , First-Person Shooter , Third-Person Shooter</p>
<p>The return of Battlefront following Disney&rsquo;s acquisition was met with much excitement, especially since DICE, the developer behind the long-running Battlefield series, would be taking the reins. Ultimately, the 2015 reboot didn&rsquo;t quite live up to the towering legacy of their predecessors, but its 2017 sequel, Star Wars Battlefront 2, is in a wonderful state. After an incredibly rocky launch, which included EA posting the most downvoted comment in Reddit&rsquo;s history and a number of scathing review scores (including Screen Rant&rsquo;s own), DICE spent the next couple of years turning Battlefront 2 into a more than serviceable FPS with a wealth of content available. A highlight, though, remains Battlefront 2&rsquo;s compelling single-player campaign, which remains the most important game in the Star Wars timeline.
Critic   Score    Screen Rant   2/5    Metacritic   68    Steam   Very Positive</p>
<p>11  Star Wars: Squadrons (2020)
Space Combat</p>
<p>Star Wars: Squadrons</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PC , PlayStation 5     Released    October 1, 2020     Developer(s)    Motive Studios     Publisher(s)    EA     Genre(s)    Action , Shooter , First-Person Shooter     ESRB    T</p>
<p>2020&rsquo;s Star Wars: Squadrons is perhaps the most authentic adaption of the films&rsquo; iconic space battles. There is a rather thorough single-player campaign, with a dual focus on main characters who are starfighter pilots for the New Republic and Galactic Empire, but the multiplayer is where Squadrons really shines. The first-person dogfighting gameplay has some real complexity to it, giving Squadrons a rather steep learning curve and high skill ceiling.
Those who pick up Squadrons in 2023 may have some difficulty getting started, though, since limited modes have lead to a waning player base in the three years since release, and those who have stuck around are primarily very good at the game. Technical issues may arise as well, with many Steam user reviews citing the games inability to launch, which is contributing to its &ldquo;Mixed&rdquo; review status.

<p>10  Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (1998)
Space Combat</p>
<p>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is an excellent alternative to Squadrons for a more dedicated single-player experience. While Squadrons&rsquo; campaign is nothing to scoff at, Rogue Squadron puts players in the cockpit of Luke Skywalker during the Galactic Civil War. All three Rogue Squadron games are must-plays for die-hard Star Wars fans, but the first is sadly the only one readily available on modern hardware. Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader and Rogue Squadron 3: Rebel Strike have never been ported from their original platform, the Nintendo GameCube. Other games from the same era, including Star Wars Episode 1: Racer and the two Knights of the Old Republic games, have received ports in recent years, so there is still hope of a Rogue Squadron comeback.
Critic   Score    Metacritic   85    Steam   Mostly Positive <br>
The PC version of Rogue Squadron, which is available on Steam, is called Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D.</p>
<p>9  LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga (2007)
Action-Adventure</p>
<p>Licensed LEGO games have long provided a comedic, casual take on some of the world&rsquo;s biggest franchises. LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga combines the first two games in the series, giving players the ability to play through its brick-based adaptation of the original and prequel trilogies. The Complete Saga is the original, beloved LEGO games formula, with fairly linear levels, basic combat, platforming, silent and gesticulating characters, and a ton of collectibles. The more recent LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a grander approach to the series, but it leans heavily into the collect-a-thon gameplay with its open-world levels, losing much of The Complete Saga&rsquo;s charm.
Critic   Score    Metacritic   80    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive</p>
<p>8  Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011)
MMORPG</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PC , Xbox One , Xbox 360 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    November 20, 1985     Developer(s)    EA , BioWare     Publisher(s)    EA     Genre(s)    Free-to-Play</p>
<p>Instead of the canceled Knights of the Old Republic 3, BioWare&rsquo;s second Star Wars game was an ambitious MMO set in the same era, Star Wars: The Old Republic, which is now maintained by Broadsword Online Games. The Old Republic is bursting with story content; each of the game&rsquo;s eight classes has its own, three-act storyline, and the MMO has received eight expansions since its release, the most recent being 2022&rsquo;s Legacy of the Sith. In terms of sheer breadth, The Old Republic is unmatched among Star Wars games, and will provide untold hours of entertainment to those who enjoy the setting of the KOTOR games.

<p>7  Star Wars: Republic Commando (2005)
First-Person Tactical Shooter</p>
<p>Star Wars: Republic Commando</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    February 28, 2005     Developer(s)    Aspyr Media , LucasArts     Publisher(s)    Aspyr Media , LucasArts , THQ Nordic     Genre(s)    Tactical , FPS     ESRB    T</p>
<p>The definitive FPS experience in the franchise is likely Republic Commando. The single-player, tactical, first-person shooter is a wholly unique Star Wars experience, putting players in control of Boss, leader of Delta Squad. Players can also issue commands to the remaining squad members, Fixer, Scorch, and Sev. Republic Commando not only gives a compelling look into the Clone Wars, but also changed Star Wars clones forever, being the first story to characterize them as individual people, rather than effectively faceless drones. Star Wars: Republic Commando originally came out in 2005, but is easily accessible thanks to it being ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in 2021.

<p>Whereas Republic Commando succeeds in its tight focus on a single clone trooper squad, Empire at War delivers an equally compelling take on the galaxy at a much larger scale. The real-time strategy game features two parallel campaigns in which the player is in control of either the Rebel Alliance or Galactic Empire&rsquo;s forces before and during the events of A New Hope, with the Imperial campaign featuring an altered version of the movie&rsquo;s plot. Star Wars: Empire at War not only has an official expansion, Forces of Corruption, but also has a wealth of mod content created since the game&rsquo;s release in 2006. Even better, the Steam version of Empire at War has full multiplayer support, and its workshop support makes modding simple.

<p>New Star Wars RTS Game Should Be An Empire At War Sequel

<p>5  Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019)
Action-Adventure, Soulslike, Metroidvania</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , Microsoft Windows     Released    November 15, 2019     Developer(s)    Respawn Entertainment     Publisher(s)    Electronic Arts     Genre(s)    Action-Adventure     ESRB    T     Sequel    Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p>
<p>Somewhere between a Soulslike and a Metroidvania, Fallen Order has players exploring labyrinthine levels with plenty of platforming across multiple planets, interspersed with technically demanding combat that makes swinging a lightsaber about as satisfying as one can imagine. Equally fascinating is its narrative, centered on Cal Kestis, a former Jedi Padawan that&rsquo;s been in hiding for five years following Order 66 and the Great Jedi Purge. A race against the Empire to find a Jedi Holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children has Cal reconnecting with the Force, grappling with the ramifications of being a child soldier in the Clone Wars, and finding a new family among the Stinger Mantis crew.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was perhaps the most innovative game to come out of EA&rsquo;s tenure as sole steward of the franchise&rsquo;s gaming license. However, its gameplay is not as refined as that in its successor, Jedi: Survivor, and its ambiguous genre categorization makes it familiar, but potentially off-putting. It doesn&rsquo;t have the deep combat or build mechanics to be a full-fledged Soulslike, and its Metroidvania aspects are similarly not at Fallen Order&rsquo;s forefront. Star Wars fans willing to try something different and engage with its mechanics will find an endearing and exciting journey, though.

<p>4  Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2005)
First/Third-Person Shooter, Space Combat</p>
<p>Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2005)</p>

<p>The original Star Wars: Battlefront 2 is the typical example of a classic Star Wars video game – and for good reason. It built on its predecessor from only a year before in practically every way, adding space battles and a playable roster of heroes and villains, including Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Darth Maul, and many more. While its multiplayer is certainly a highlight, and the Galactic Conquest mode is sorely missed in the reboot series, Battlefront 2&rsquo;s campaign serves to elevate it. Centering on the 501st Legion, the main story sees the harrowing development of the clone trooper division from Republic soldiers, to the Imperial unit known as Vader&rsquo;s Fist.

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is one of the most recent Star Wars games, and has immediately established itself as one of the franchise&rsquo;s greatest. Being brand-new helps the graphical side of things – Jedi: Survivor is gorgeous – but the game also builds on its predecessor, Fallen Order, in every way, delivering a robust and varied experience. The Metroidvania and Soulslike gameplay returns with larger environments, more lightsaber stances, and a better story. Cal and the Stinger Mantis crew return five years after the first game as more compelling characters, with Cal emerging as one of Star Wars&rsquo; best heroes to date. Jedi: Survivor is a genuine Star Wars adventure front to back, and is just the latest installment in one of the franchise&rsquo;s most endearing storylines.

<p>2  Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic 2 – The Sith Lords (2004)
RPG</p>
<p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords</p>
<p>Franchise    Star Wars     Platform(s)    Android , iOS , macOS , Nintendo Switch , Linux , Xbox (Original)     Released    December 6, 2004     Developer(s)    Obsidian Entertainment     Publisher(s)    LucasArts     Genre(s)    RPG ,  Sci-Fi     ESRB    T     Prequel(s)    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</p>
<p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 has only one glaring fault: it&rsquo;s technically incomplete. Playing the vanilla version is by no means bad – it&rsquo;s still an incredible game – but the ending segments in particular feel rushed. Thankfully, the popular Restored Content mod is available through the Steam workshop for that version of the game, rounding out Obsidian Entertainment&rsquo;s deep and thought-provoking RPG. On the other hand, the more recent Switch port has unfortunately abandoned its plans to integrate the Restored Content as DLC, leaving the most accessible version slightly lacking.
KOTOR 2&rsquo;s main cast of characters in particular are a solid argument for claiming it&rsquo;s better than KOTOR 1, but regardless of the verdict on comparing the two, The Sith Lords is a definite high point among the many Star Wars video games. Centering on a protagonist exiled from a Jedi Order on the verge of being wiped out by the Sith, KOTOR 2 tells a captivating story philosophically unmatched by most other Star Wars media, constantly calling into question the Jedi versus Sith dichotomy, and truly grappling with a number of ethical and moral dilemmas inherent to being a Force user.

Although dated in visuals, the 2003 release from BioWare is a triumph of storytelling in both Star Wars and the RPG genre as a whole. Players take control of an amnesiac soldier in a bygone era of the Galactic Republic roughly 4,000 years before the mainline film saga. One of three classes are chosen at the beginning of the game, and another is selected shortly after when the main character is trained to become a Jedi.
Knights of the Old Republic (and its sequel) is a sprawling, planet-hopping game built on a d20 system adapted from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and is filled with a number of surprising revelations and fascinating story arcs. Character development – both through the narrative and in selecting the custom character and companions&rsquo; skills and Force powers – is a particular highlight of KOTOR, helping it maintain its beloved status for two decades. When it comes to Star Wars games, Knights of the Old Republic has yet to be beaten, still used as a high-water mark for the franchise&rsquo;s potential in the medium.
