## Literature Review

Players in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can choose any of their traveling companions to begin a romance with. However which ones are worth the time to woo?




Like many RPGs, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 allows for characters to be romanced, adding further depth to an already epic tale. These romances can open up new dialogue and create a deeper understanding of the world. However, with so many romance options available, it&#39;s important to know who is worth wooing.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
Baldur’s Gate 3 has a few romance options for those inclined to mix love with adventuring as they attempt to save Faerûn. There are even other romantic alternatives available that aren’t as long-term as a full romance, such as the Dream Guardian, Mizora, and a couple of very friendly Drow twins. However, for those wanting the full experience, the party companions are the characters to pursue, with the best opportunity for a deep connection with these ongoing characters.

 12  Minthara 
Drow Paladin Of The Absolute
        

Minthara&#39;s romance in Baldur’s Gate 3 is a complicated one and certainly not for everyone. Firstly, it is necessary to betray the Druid Grove and side with the Absolute to even have her as a companion. This requires killing a lot of innocent characters, and risks losing approval from many other companions.
Choosing to betray the Druid Grove will come at the cost of three other companions, who will be locked out because of the decision. 

As a devoted follower of the Absolute, Minthara will obviously agree with decisions that further the cult&#39;s goals and generally be assertive when dealing with others, but she likes it when she is obeyed. She views kindness as a weakness, so will disapprove of many quests to aid others. However, the whole romance feels shallow and is lacking many of the intimate moments and depth the other romances have.

 11  Halsin 
Wood Elf Druid
        

Halsin wasn’t originally designed to be a romanceable companion in Baldur’s Gate 3 and, unfortunately, it shows. After being absent for the majority of Act One, he does not become available for romance until the end of Act Two, when the Shadow Curse is lifted, although he can be flirted with. Asking him about himself and his previous lovers will be enough to trigger the romance dialogue later, so long as his approval is high enough.
After that, though, the whole experience feels rushed with a polyamorous aspect that doesn’t quite work as well as people hoped. Halsin’s romance is much more passive than the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Origin characters, with an unsatisfying ending. However, those looking to win the heart of the Archdruid should keep in mind that he loves nature, kindness, and has a respect for life, while he disapproves of cruelty and unnecessary violence.





 10  Mizora 
Wyll&#39;s Infernal Patron
        

Romancing Mizora will not be a long-term relationship but rather a one-time rendezvous with many unhappy consequences. As Wyll&#39;s patron, whether there has been any flirtation between the main character and Wyll, he will be very angry. Many of the companions will be upset, including Gale, Lae&#39;zel, and Karlach, while others may be more neutral, but none will be happy about the situation. After the fling has finished, there is no continued relationship with the half-devil character.





 9  Haarlep 
Incubus
        

Haarlep is the personal incubus of Raphael, who takes on Raphael&#39;s appearance. Haarlep offers a deal wherein a one-time encounter can be traded for some crucial information. Rejecting the deal will lead to combat with Haarlep and numerous imps, whereas accepting will lead to several rolls to attempt to not be overpowered by the incubus&#39; powers. If Haarlep is successful, it can lead to many very uncomfortable situations for the character throughout the rest of the game, and the disapproval of most of the party.





 8  The Emperor 
Mind Flayer
        

The Emperor is another one-time fling that can happen in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which certainly takes the fantasy genre to new levels of romance. The mind flayer will give a very straightforward proposition for one night of passion in the Astral Plane. All the party members will be forced to quite awkwardly know about the romp through their dreams, yet none will mention it, and after the night, things will not have any lasting effects.

 7  Sorn Orlith And Nym 
The Drow Twins
        

Sorn Orlith and his twin sister Nym Orlith are available for no-strings-attached romantic encounters for gold at Sharess&#39; Caress. The Drow Twins are 500 gold for one, or the main character can spend 1,000 gold to hire both at once. Depending on the romancing status with Shadowheart, players could have her join in, and Astarion and Halsin would also consider it if group fun is an intriguing prospect.

 6  Karlach 
Tiefling Barbarian
        

Like Halsin, Karlach was not originally designed to be a Baldur’s Gate 3 romance option; however, unlike Halsin, Karlach’s romancing story is much more thought out. Although the romance has more depth than Halsin’s, Karlach’s romantic story still feels rushed at times and unsatisfactorily unfinished. That said, those who choose to pursue this fiery Tiefling will find a tender and adorable, if bittersweet, relationship waiting for them by showing Karlach kindness. Karlach is a good person and appreciates and approves of those who help the weak and are honest. She will disapprove of hurting others, lies, and siding with Zariel or Mizora.
It&#39;s important to know that any Karlach romance will end with some level of tragedy due to her circumstances and personal quest line. 






 5  Wyll 
Human Warlock
        

Wyll&#39;s romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is an odd one. On the one hand, it is very sweet, with Wyll being quite chivalrous. On the other hand, it is possible to get the romance scene to trigger despite having never flirted with him, leading some to find themselves accidentally in a committed relationship with the Blade of Frontiers. One of the most obvious ways to woo Wyll is to help him with his pact and support him through Mizora&#39;s shenanigans. As the hero of the Sword Coast, Wyll approves of helping those in need, being brave, and generally being kind. 





 4  Lae&#39;zel 
Githyanki Fighter


 







Romance with Lae&#39;zel is initiated by her and, to start with, is purely physical. Sticking by her side, though, will reveal a softer and wonderfully thoughtful romance. Lae&#39;zel appreciates bluntness, showing power over others, and generally being pro-gith and supporting her. She won&#39;t like non-violent tactics and will often grumble when the party goes out of its way to help the weak; however, that doesn&#39;t mean an evil Baldur’s Gate 3 playthrough is the only way to win this Githyanki&#39;s heart, as talking to her can allow her to open up more resulting in very sweet moments.

 3  Gale 
Human Wizard
        

Gale was the most romanced character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s early access, and it&#39;s not hard to see why. The charming and witty wizard&#39;s romance starts slow, but as impending doom looms on the horizon, he takes the plunge, admitting his feelings. Gale&#39;s romance is one of respect and understanding, building to a very traditional relationship. To win Gale&#39;s heart is simple enough, as he approves of kindness, solving problems intelligently, and understanding his condition, the Netherese orb in his chest. Gale disapproves of cruelty, unnecessary violence, and general stupidity or a lack of curiosity. Overall, Gale is the best route for those looking for a more classic fantasy romance.

 2  Astarion 
High Elf Rogue Vampire Spawn


 







Astarion is one of the trickier romances in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as the vampire-spawn rogue doesn&#39;t let his guard down easily. However, once that prickly facade is breached, a remarkably sweet relationship begins. Astarion&#39;s romance feels deep and well-thought-out, with real consequences felt later in the game. Winning Astarion&#39;s approval involves being a little selfish and not helping others without reward, not appearing weak, and of course, letting him feed. He dislikes being judged as a monster and playing the hero, although it&#39;s surprisingly easy for good characters to gain his approval with the right dialogue options. Astarion has one of the most detailed and fulfilling romances next to Shadowheart, due to how he will grow and change depending on the main character&#39;s actions and affections.

 1  Shadowheart 
Half-Elf Cleric


 







The first companion after escaping the nautiloid also has the best romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Shadowheart starts off as a devoted cleric of Shar, but throughout the game, choices can change her entire outlook on life and herself. Romancing her isn&#39;t easy, as she is slow to trust and open up, but those who consistently show her they can be trusted will be rewarded with deep and fulfilling romance.
Shadowheart&#39;s approval can be gained by using deception and tricks to fool enemies, treating her with respect, and being kind to children. She will disapprove of unnecessary violence, siding with cruel people, and being too pushy for her to talk about herself. Getting Shadowheart to open up can be a challenge, but her romance adds so much to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that it&#39;s hard to imagine the game without it.
