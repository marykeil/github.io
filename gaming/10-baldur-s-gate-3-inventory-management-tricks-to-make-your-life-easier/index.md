 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Add To Wares 
Quickly Sell Items To Vendors


 







While the instinct for many can be to keep hold of everything they come across in case it will be useful later, there are plenty of items in BG3 that can be sold with no negative effects. As the game progresses, lower level equipment should be sold for gold in order to buy more needed items. A very easy way to do this is to add unwanted items to Wares, as this can be done and undone with a single click. Adding inventory items to Wares allows for them to be quickly sold to vendors without having to hunt through the character’s entire inventory, and if players get into the habit of doing this early on, it will soon become second nature.
Multiple items can be selected at once by using Left Ctrl and left-clicking on PC, or using the right trigger on consoles. 






 9  Use The Hotbar 
Easy Access To Items
        

Throughout BG3, the party will come across numerous spell scrolls, grenades, and potions that are meant to be used to help them with their adventure. But far too often, these useful items will sit forgotten in the party inventory, taking up valuable space. Instead, these items should be added to the hotbar, as having them in plain sight will make them much more likely to be used in battle. While BG3 will do this automatically for some items, it is always best to check and alter the hotbar for personal preference and ease of use.





 8  View The Whole Party&#39;s Inventory 
Quickly Exchange &amp; Compare Items
        

Trying to manage the inventory for four characters at once can be a little tricky, and while many might be shifting between each companion individually, there is a better way. When playing on PC, pressing the Tab key will open up all four current party members&#39; inventories. This makes moving items between characters much easier, as well as comparing equipment when playing in BG3’s multiplayer.





 7  Split Gold Between The Party 
One Character Hording Gold Adds A Lot Of Carry Weight
        

While it is very tempting for the player character to be the one holding onto all the gold the party has, this is actually a bad idea in BG3. Although gold is light, the more of it the party gathers, the more weight will accumulate in a character’s inventory. So it’s a good idea to split the party’s gold between companions who are most often in the party, and then pool it back together when visiting vendors.
Inventory carrying capacity is calculated based off of a character&#39;s Strength score, so the stronger the character, the more they can carry. 






 6  Automatic Bag Sorting 
Easily Collect Keys, Camp Supplies, &amp; More


 







Certain inventory items will be automatically sorted into separate bags, such as keys, camp supplies, and alchemy ingredients. However, this system isn’t perfect, and sometimes the items get missed and will end up in the main inventory. A quick way to get them back into their assigned containers is to open up the party inventory using the Tab key, and drag the container for the items that need sorting into another character’s inventory. Then, by simply putting it back in the original character’s inventory, it will scoop up all the items that should go into it.





 5  Use More Bags 
Inventory Organization
        

Speaking of other containers within a character’s inventory, it is a good idea to pick up other bags, backpacks and pouches that the party comes across to help with organization. These other containers can then have items sorted into them to reduce clutter the main inventory screen. This way, potions can be kept separate from poisons, spell scrolls neatly tucked away, and quest specific items stored safely.
Be aware that any spell scrolls stored in bags within the inventory might not show up for spells to learn for wizards. 






 4  Use Equipment Slots 
Clicking On Equipment Slots Shows Available Gear
        

Added after launch, BG3 has a built-in way to easily manage equipment by clicking on the equipment slots themselves. Clicking on a slot will open a small window which will show all the gear currently available for that particular slot. Gear that is being used by party members will have a symbol on it showing that it is equipped, but it makes changing companion gear much quicker than having to search through everybody&#39;s inventories for a single item.
This will only show gear currently on the active party and will not include gear stored in the camp chest. 






 3  Use The Sort By Function 
Sort By Weight, Value, Type, Or Latest


 







BG3&#39;s inventory screen has a sort function at the top to make it easier to organize what a particular character has. There are four options: Latest, Value, Weight, and Type. Type will most likely be the default for many, as it will group items together by type, while Weight will make it easier to root out items that are encumbering a character. Value sorts by how much gold something is worth and is great for finding low level items to add to Wares. Finally, Latest will order the inventory with the newest items at the top.





 2  Use The Search Bar 
Find Specific Items Easier
        

At the top of the inventory screen there is also a search bar which can be typed into to find specific items or type of items. This can really come in handy when looking for quest items such as the Dawnmaster’s Crest in the Mountain Pass or the Sussar Bark to complete the Masterwork Weapon. Best of all, if viewing the whole party with TAB, the search function will look through everyone’s inventories to find who is holding a particular item.





 1  Send Items Back To Camp 
Camp Chests Have Infinite Storage
        

Finally, one way to keep a character’s inventory organized and reduce the weight they are carrying is to get used to sending things back to camp. Sending any supplies and unneeded magical items back to camp is something that is important to get into the habit of doing, and is especially vital with camp supplies, which are so abundant in Baldur’s Gate 3 that it is very easy to become weighed down by them. When items are sent to camp, they are stored safely in the camp chest, which has infinite storage capacity, ready to be used later.
