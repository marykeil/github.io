# Secret Marvels Spider-Man 2 Mode Puts One Spider-Verse Character In The Spotlight


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 includes a variety of suits from the heroes&#39; cinematic adventures, including suits from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and its sequel.   While the Spider-Verse suits have a distinct visual style that fans enjoy, they can feel out of place in the more realistic-looking New York map of the game due to their differently-stylized textures.   Players have found a way to create the black and white Spider-Man Noir universe within Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s settings, using options like motion blur, film grain, and high contrast settings to achieve the desired look.

## Literature Review

A Spider-Man 2 player has used the game&#39;s settings to transform New York into one of the worlds seen in the award-winning Into the Spider-Verse movie.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has a variety of suits for Peter and Miles, from original designs to classic comic styles. Insomniac Games&#39; sequel has also aimed to include many suits from the heroes&#39; cinematic adventures, with Peter&#39;s suits from the Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland iterations all included. Miles and Peter also have suits inspired by from the Academy Award-winning animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and its acclaimed sequel Across the Spider-Verse.




The Spider-Verse movie suits are favorites among fans of the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games thanks to their distinct visual style and the option to change the frame-rate and animation style for the characters to match that of the films&#39;. In those movies, however, each hero&#39;s universe was styled differently as well to match. Therefore, when exploring Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s more realistic-looking New York map in these suits, the characters can feel a bit out of place due to their differently-stylized textures, although it could be argued this is the point as they&#39;re a look plucked from a different universe.

  


 Spider-Noir&#39;s Universe Has Been Created In Spider-Man 2 
          




&#34;Spider-Noir&#34; was portrayed by Nicolas Cage in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse as a parody of the darker, grizzled detectives of the 1930s pulp fiction novels and was one of the award-winning movie&#39;s highlights. This take on the character originated in his own 4-part Spider-Man: Noir comic run in 2009 - which later got sequels - and appeared in gaming a year later in the multiverse-hopping Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions.

Insomniac had previously included a Noir costume for Peter Parker based on the comics and Shattered Dimensions design, however, this suit has been cut for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 in favor of the animated look of the movies instead, which features a fedora and a long flowing coat to make use of the sequel&#39;s new cape physics, making it Peter&#39;s only Into the Spider-Verse suit, as others like Peter B. Parker which appeared in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s DLC have also been cut for the sequel.


 




Redditor SpaceYetiGamer has managed to find a way to create the black and white Spider-Man Noir universe entirely through Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s main settings. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has a wealth of options designed for accessibility to assist a variety of players to best experience the game, but these can be used to create striking new visuals, as SpaceYetiGamer demonstrates in their video footage.

                  Every Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Suit For Peter &amp; Where It’s From   Including its pre-order content and Digital Deluxe Edition, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 features 39 different suits for Peter Parker to wear.    



 How To Transform Spider-Man 2 Into The Noir Universe 
          

Previously, players had tried to change the world of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales to best match the cel-shaded &#34;Vintage&#34; or &#34;Animated&#34; looks via mods on PC, but the Spider-Noir look can be accomplished entirely without mods on the PS5. According to SpaceYetiGamer, the settings that should be changed to achieve this look are found under Visual Settings and are as follows:




 Screen Effects   Motion Blur  On   Film Grain  10   Chromatic Aberration  On   Depth of Field  On   Film Style Animation  On   Comic SFX  On   





The Comic SFX won&#39;t be in black and white, but they will add a small burst of color to the world and match the Spider-Verse movies&#39; style




 High Contrast Options   Hero Shader  None   Ally Shader  None   NPC Shader  White   Enemy Shader  Custom (activated automatically by the following 5 shaders)   Basic Enemy Shader  White   Ranged Enemy Shader  White   Advanced Enemy Shader  Black   Menace Enemy Shader  White   Boss Shader  Black   Story Critical Shader  None   Combat Interactable Shader  None   High Contrast Background  On   High Contrast Spider-Sense  None   High Contrast Perfect Dodge  None   








These high contrast settings may not disappear instantly upon changing it back to the game&#39;s default settings. If this occurs, simply exit the game and re-enter it from the main menu and the world will appear in its default appearance.




The resulting look is certainly a fun way to play Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and adds an extra level of immersion when donning Peter&#39;s new Noir suit. Turning off the Ally and Hero shaders allows Miles to blend in more seamlessly when wearing his Spider-Verse movie-inspired suits as well, so as the game has the duo team up through city events, it will appear like Miles has jumped in from another dimension for the assist, which can be a fun homage to the movies&#39; multiverse-spanning antics.
