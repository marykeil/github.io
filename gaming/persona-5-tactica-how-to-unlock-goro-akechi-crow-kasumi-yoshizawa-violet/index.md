## Literature Review

Akechi and Kasumi are some fan favorites that appear to be missing from Persona 5 Tactica, but there is actually a way to unlock Crow &amp; Violet.





Though many characters in Persona 5 Tactica must be unlocked through missions, Akechi and Kasumi are the only exceptions. Rather than being unlocked through progress, you will have to finish the game, as well as one other task, to have the option to add Akechi (Crow) and Kasumi (Violet) to your New Game&#43; party.

It is essential to know that Kasumi Yoshizawa and Goro Akechi cannot technically become a part of the party normally. Even after unlocking them, only their Personas will be playable, not the characters themselves, as they were never intended to be part of the mainline story. For this reason, it is impossible to use them in any capacity during the Persona 5 Tactica&#39;s first playthrough.

However, once the main narrative has been completed, you will unlock Persona 5 Tactica&#39;s New Game&#43; mode. Once this is unlocked, the Repaint Your Heart DLC will need to be completed before heading back into the game. This DLC is additional content that must be purchased and downloaded. This is where the first introduction of Kasumi and Akechi will take place in Persona 5 Tactica.




Once both the main game and the Repaint Your Heart DLC have been completed, you can finally head into the New Game&#43; mode. There should be a notification at some point between completing the DLC and starting New Game&#43; that says new content is now available in New Game&#43;. Even though the notice will state that Akechi and Kasumi are now available in the base game, that is strictly for New Game&#43; files only and won&#39;t be immediately available.

Instead, players will still need to reach the point in the story where the Phantom Thieves begin to reconvene. Again, since they were not intended to be part of the main story, they will not have any character dialogue or have any influence on the narrative, and everything will still play out the same way as before. The only change is that Crow and Violet will now appear as an option when selecting mission party members in Persona 5 Tactica, but that is all that can be unlocked for Akechi and Kasumi.
