## Literature Review

Becoming an Astronaut in BitLife can take a lot of effort, since this career can only be achieved by following a specific path with your character.





You need to buy the Astronaut Special Career Pack for BitLife before considering pursuing this profession. While this does come free with the Boss Mode attachment to the game, those who don&#39;t have this addition will have to buy it as an extra feature. Unlike picking careers in The Sims 4 or other simulation titles, multiple steps to this process unlock when you purchase the right content.

 How to Be An Astronaut In BitLife 
          

There are three tasks for your character to follow to be an Astronaut: getting a STEM degree, going to the Space Academy to train, and finally applying to a Space Agency. The first step here can be confusing, but your character only needs to enter a university to begin studying. Sign up for a science, mathematics, engineering, or technology major to receive a STEM degree in BitLife when you graduate.

The next step involves taking 40 hours of flight lessons, which cost a few thousand dollars to take in BitLife. You will find this extra training through the Activities menu, then in the Licenses category, where you can find Flight School as an option. After you take the time to go through courses, head back to Licenses and pick the Pilot&#39;s License to answer a question correctly for the certification.




Now you&#39;re ready to head to the Space Academy, which can be attended by going to the Occupation menu and selecting Astronaut from the Special Careers. Apply for the program in BitLife and pay for two years of training in the Fitness, Flight, and Technical courses. You will need to answer several quiz questions that challenge what you learn to graduate from the Academy.



You have to perform well in the Space Academy to pass each course. Failing grades appear red, but you are able to bring these back to a healthy green if you answer technical questions correctly.




When you have completed all the education you need, apply to your country&#39;s Space Agency and answer the interview questions correctly to finally become an Astronaut in BitLife.
