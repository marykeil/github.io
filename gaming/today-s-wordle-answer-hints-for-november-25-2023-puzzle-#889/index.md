## Literature Review

November 25th’s Wordle answer isn’t the hardest to solve; however, players might need to use hints at some point if they aren’t cautious.





Since today’s answer has multiple vowels, you will have a better chance of solving the puzzle using Wordle’s hard mode. The main aim here is to discover the correct position of at least two so that you can solve the answer without much help. However, this is a gargantuan task; if you need help, these hints might be helpful.

Wordle does not have a great framework for providing hints apart from the color-changing boxes. Therefore, using hints to solve the daily Wordle is as common as using them for Crossword puzzles. These clues do not spoil the answer completely but still give a fair idea that might help you solve November 25th’s Wordle answer:

 Hint 1  There are no repeating letters.   Hint 2  The answer is used as a noun and a verb.   Hint 3  The vowels are in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th position.   Hint 4  A person who shows the way to others.

The November 25th Wordle answer is GUIDE.

Trying to find the answer without using hints might be slightly hard due to the three vowels. We used the words SPARE, ASIDE, and GLIDE in our first three attempts, which revealed the correct position of four letters, two of which were vowels. Since the answer has three vowels, that can be your next hint to solve the puzzle. After rearranging the four letters and using the hit-and-trial method, we were finally able to solve today’s Wordle answer with GUIDE in our fifth attempt.
