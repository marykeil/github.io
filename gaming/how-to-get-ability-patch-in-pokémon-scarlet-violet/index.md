## Literature Review

If Trainers are looking to unlock the unique Hidden Ability of one of their Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, they will need an Ability Patch.





However, getting an Ability Patch is much harder as it requires you to participate in 6-Star Tera Raids. You can only access these raids once you&#39;ve completed Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s main story, defeated all Gym Leaders a second time, and won the postgame tournament at Naranja/Uva Academy. You will eventually receive a call from Professor Jacq asking you to find Tera Raids across Paldea.




                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: Perrserker Build For 6-Star Tera Raids   The Galarian Pokemon, Perrserker in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet takes down 5 and 6-star Tera Raids in seconds with defensive and offensive buffs.

Once you have completed three or more 5-Star Tera Raids, you will get another call from Professor Jacq. He will inform that a 6-Star Tera Raid is available this time but advises against entering it. You can ignore this warning and go enter the Tera Raid. However, it is advised to be well prepared as it can be rather challenging.



YouTuber RageGamingVideos states that the difficulty for 6-Star Raids is noticeably significant, and you might be defeated several times before you achieve your first victory and hopefully get the Ability Patch.

 
 







According to Game Rant, the drop rate for the Ability Patch is extremely low from a 6-Star Tera Raid in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. So you might have to take part in many 6-Star Tera Raids before you get the Ability Patch. However, you can use an Ability Capsule or Pokémon HOME&#39;s Move Reset &amp; Ability Reset feature instead if you are only looking to swap moves. You can get an Ability Capsule from the many Chansey Supply shops around Paldea for ₽100,000 in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
