# Pokémon Gen 10 Games Could Fix A Major Problem With Starters


## SUMMARY 



  The next Generation of Pokémon games, Gen 10, has the opportunity to add missing starter designs, such as a Grass-type crocodile and a Fire-type turtle.   The design of starter Pokémon follows a pattern, with each generation featuring Grass-, Fire-, and Water-type starters. However, there are still some missing starter designs.   The release of Pokémon Gen 10 games is expected in late 2025, and fans can look forward to the announcement of these new starters much earlier.

## Literature Review

Though the Pokémon Gen 10 games are likely still a while away from being released, they could fix a current problem the franchise has been facing.




The Pokémon Generation 10 games can fix a major problem with the first partner Pokémon, also popularly known as starters. The next Generation is likely still a while away, but it is already being thoroughly discussed, as the first Gen 9 games have seemingly come to a conclusion with the release of the Indigo Disk DLC and, subsequently, the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Though the titles set in Paldea are likely concluded in terms of story, Gen 9 is still occurring. There is no official confirmation of upcoming games, but several rumors suggest at least a remake.




Aside from the speculation, there are a lot of hints in Scarlet and Violet that point toward Gen 5 remakes, which would be encompassed by the current Gen 9. If Nintendo is to follow up on the success of the product model established by Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there is also a chance that Gen 9 will receive yet another core title to wrap it up. Even with the progress through Gen 9, there are already talks about the Pokémon Gen 10 games, and one player highlighted a problem with starters that these upcoming titles can fix.

                  10 Pokémon That Deserve Their Own Spin-Off Game After Legends: Arceus   There are several Pokémon that could be put under the spotlight for a Legends: Arceus-like game, even if it is a spin-off. Here are some of the best.   


 Pokémon Gen 10 Can Add Absent Starter Designs 
          




As seen in the post made by Makio &amp; JRoses on X, there are still a few starter designs that are missing from the franchise – an error that could be fixed with the release of Gen 10 games. Among starters that are based on crocodiles, there is still a Grass-type missing, for instance. The Fire-type and Water-type crocodile slots are already occupied by Fuecoco and Totodile, respectively. Another example is that, in terms of turtle designs for starters in Pokémon games, the franchise is still missing a Fire-type turtle to go alongside Grass-type Turtwig and Water-type Squirtle.



Of course, the post does not address certain families set up by creatures, such as the echidna starters with Cyndaquil or the penguin starters with Piplup.




                  Pokémon Day 2024 Predictions: What Pokémon Games May Get Revealed   There are many new titles that can be announced during Pokémon Day 2024. Here are the most likely ones to be revealed during the event.   






 Starters In Pokémon Are Not As Random As You Think 
          

Though the order in which they are released is randomized and completely up to Nintendo, the designs of these starter Pokémon do seem to follow a pattern, exemplified by the post made by Makio &amp; JRoses. There are starter families based on real-life animals, and they are filled with creatures with the three standard starter Types: Grass-, Fire-, and Water-type. Other than the Grass-type crocodile and Fire-type turtle starters, the Pokémon series is still missing three extra starter designs. Players have yet to see an official Water-type cat-based starter, a Water-type monkey, and a Fire-type frog.


 




At least a portion of these missing starter designs could be added with Pokémon Gen 10 games. This would resolve their current absence from the franchise and help fill up this unofficial thread that Nintendo seems to follow. Of course, the company could simply create new starters that have nothing to do with the current animals the previous ones are based on. Players should not have to wait long to know, as Pokémon Gen 10 games should arrive at some point in late 2025 – and their announcement should come a lot earlier.
