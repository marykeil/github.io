## Literature Review

There are several editions of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora available with varying content, and its season pass includes further story DLC missions.




Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is Ubisoft subsidiary Massive Entertainment&#39;s upcoming open-world game set in James Cameron&#39;s hugely successful Avatar franchise. Cameron&#39;s confirmed that the game&#39;s story is canonical, and similarly to the movies, Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora will focus on the conflict between the alien Na&#39;vi tribe, and the Resource Development Administration (RDA), as the latter tries to plunder the planet Pandora for resources.




Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s protagonist is described as being a child of two worlds, born Na&#39;vi but raised and trained by the RDA after being abducted as a child by one of the RDA&#39;s leaders, John Mercer. This brutal yet unique upbringing has provided her experience with the RDA&#39;s futuristic military tech, but upon reintegrating with the Na&#39;vi after 15 years in RDA captivity, she begins to become accustomed to using the tribes&#39; traditional weaponry as well. This upbringing makes her quite a formidable adversary to the RDA as she&#39;s able to use their tactics against them.

                  Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora - Story, Gameplay &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s everything we know so far about the release date, price, story, and gameplay for Ubisoft&#39;s open-world game, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.   


 Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora&#39;s Season Pass Includes Story DLC 
There Are 2 Additional Chapters And A Bonus Quest
          




Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s story is set to continue after the game&#39;s initial launch, with Ubisoft confirming two story DLC packs: The Sky Breaker, and Secrets of the Spires. Both of these story packs will be included in the game&#39;s Season Pass, which will be included in some of the game&#39;s special editions or will be available to purchase separately post-launch.

The Sky Breaker shows the unity of many Na’vi clans as they celebrate at their great festival of games before a &#34;mysterious shadow&#34; - likely some kind of RDA threat - appears in the sky. Secrets of the Spires will take place later and seems to focus primarily on aerial combat as players uncover the secrets of a new canyon region and work to restore peace to the land.



The Sky Breaker will launch in the Summer of 2024, and Secrets of the Spires will launch months later in the Fall.







The Season Pass will include a further bonus quest, &#34;Familiar Echoes&#34;, in which players are tasked with infiltrating a highly secured RDA military base and hacking their classified data to sabotage them from the inside. The pass also contains a Resistance cosmetic bundle, which consists of one banshee cosmetic set, one character gear set, and one unique weapon.
