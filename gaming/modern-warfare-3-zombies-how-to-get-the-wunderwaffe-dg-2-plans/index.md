## Literature Review

The Wunderwaffe DG-2 is an extremely powerful weapon in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies that you can get the plans for by completing a certain mission.





The Wunderwaffe DG-2 stands out as one of the best weapons for beginners of Zombies since its raw strength makes it a capable gun in anyone&#39;s hands. Normally, you can find this ultra-rare tool from loot caches or Rift Rewards, but you lose the gun whenever you exfil out. Challenging Aether Nests or Infected Strongholds might let you get a hold of this weapon early if you have trouble finding its blueprints.




                  Modern Warfare 3 Split-Screen Explained: Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 includes split-screen as an option in some game modes. Here’s what to expect with Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.   


 How to Find The Wunderwaffe DG-2 Plans in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

The Wunderwaffe DG-2 plans are given to you as a reward for finishing the &#34;Holdout&#34; Tier 4 mission in Act 3 of Modern Warfare 3 Zombie&#39;s story. This quest asks you to complete an Outlast Contract and its objectives before you or your squad exfils out of Urzikstan. The goal here is to kill 50 different enemies while in a limited corrupted space without leaving before that exact number of undead has been taken out.

As of the time of writing, there has been a reported bug in the Wunderwaffe DG-2 plans that was not dropped as a reward for the Outlast Contract. If this happens, simply redeploy and complete the mission again to see if the bug persists.




Once you eliminate the exact number of zombies you need in the small area marked on your map, look around for a Rift Reward to get the Wunderwaffe DG-2 plans. Even though you have 45 minutes to finish this Contract, you can leave right away if you want and still get the blueprints. However, only one set of plans can drop per deployment, so multiple people in a squad can&#39;t get more than one copy.

Like other schematics, you need to exfil safely to bring the blueprints back to your crafting menu. If you are killed during a deployment with the plans, you will drop them until you find your body again before the item disappears. If you want to get the Wunderwaffe DG-2 plans in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, you have to be careful as you or your squad leave the map.
