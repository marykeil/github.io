## Literature Review

As a relatively broad genre, action games make up a large part of 2024&#39;s announced game releases, including both triple-A and indie titles.




2024 is looking to be a strong year for action games, with major titles like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 filling out the early months of the year - but in a genre as broad as action, there are plenty of upcoming games outside the major titles that have potential. With a variety of both sequels and original releases, 2024&#39;s upcoming action games range from those more purely focused on their combat to those that take a broader approach, mixing in gameplay from other genres.
While many of this year&#39;s (and next year&#39;s) upcoming games have already been announced, including several of 2024&#39;s most anticipated action games, many of them haven&#39;t received specific release dates yet. Additionally, it&#39;s likely that some games might be announced and released within the year as well, like 2023&#39;s surprise release of Hi-Fi Rush near the end of January. Notably, most of 2024&#39;s confirmed action game release dates fall within the first quarter of the year, with other announced games having either unspecified 2024 release dates or being planned to launch in later quarters.

 Every Action Game Releasing In Q1 2024 
Action Games Releasing Between January 1 - March 31


 







The first quarter of 2024 holds the majority of the games with known release dates, including highly anticipated RPGs like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2. Other notable highlights include Rise of the Ronin from Team Ninja (Nioh, Wo Long), Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Granblue Fantasy Relink. Notably, however, while S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has previously been announced for early 2024, the game has been prone to delays and may end up coming out in later parts of the year, and games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Skull and Bones have had notoriously troubled development cycles.
The list of every action game planned to be released in Q1 2024 is as follows:

Of the listed titles, Coneru: Dimensions Girl and Hades II are notably the only games without specific release dates, with Coneru set for an unspecified April release, and Hades II planned to enter Early Access in a to-be-announced date in the second quarter of 2024.
The list of every action game planned to release in Q2 2024 is as follows:

 Every Action Game Releasing In Q3 2024 
Action Games Releasing Between July 1 - September 30


 







Moving into the second half of the year, only two games have been confirmed to be releasing in the third quarter - Black Myth: Wukong and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Black Myth, despite being from relatively unknown studio Game Science, has quickly become one of the most highly anticipated releases of the year for the impressive visuals and gameplay showcased in many of the game&#39;s trailers, and Space Marine 2 is a sequel to a well-regarded third-person shooter of the same name released in 2011.
The two games currently announced to be releasing in Q3 of 2024 are as follows:
  Game Title   Release Date   Platforms    Black Myth: Wukong   August 20   PC, PS5, Xbox X/S    Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2   September 9   PC, PS5, Xbox X/S
