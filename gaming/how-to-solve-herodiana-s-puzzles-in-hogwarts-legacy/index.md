## Literature Review

In Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Hall of Herodiana quest, you have to use the Accio and Depulso spells to move blocks and cross three puzzle rooms for rewards.





When you can, speak to Sophronia Franklin, a Ravenclaw student, near the Charms classroom. She will tell you about Herodiana and how this master of the Banishing charm had a private space in Hogwarts that will be marked on your map. Follow the icon on your map to the Astronomy Wing in Hogwarts Legacy and use Depulso to activate a switch that opens up The Hall location.




                  Hogwarts Legacy: Every House Exclusive Quest, Ranked   In Hogwarts Legacy, which house a player gets sorted into matters for more than just cosmetics, there are also unique quests available for each.    


 How To Solve The First Hall Of Herodiana Puzzle 
         

Simply push the metal cubes against the wall with Depulso to solve this relatively easy first puzzle in The Hall. At this point, you should have Accio and Depulso as unlocked spells in Hogwarts Legacy due to some classes with your professors. This gives you a platform to climb on to reach the upper section of the room, where you can find a chest containing Herodiana&#39;s Cape, a cosmetic item.



Cosmetics items are objects that change your character&#39;s appearance in Hogwarts Legacy and are accessed through the Gear section of your Field Guide menu.









 How To Solve The Second Hall Of Herodiana Puzzle 
         

Reaching the second puzzle, you will have to connect the blocks from the right wall to the single block to your left with the Accio spell. This groups every block in the room together, letting you move them in a set of three instead of one at a time. With Depulso, push the three blocks forward to your right until they are lined up against the edge of the puzzle area, letting you climb up to the platform above in Hogwarts Legacy.

Thankfully, there are no enemies to fight in any puzzle rooms within The Hall of Herodiana. Like the first area, you will find a chest containing another outfit piece once you climb the blocks you moved. The Herodiana&#39;s Attire item in Hogwarts Legacy may be equipped for your character at any time to make you look like the famous Ravenclaw witch.






 How To Solve The Third Hall Of Herodiana Puzzle 
         

The last puzzle here in Hogwarts Legacy is definitely the hardest, with way more blocks to move than the previous two rooms combined. First, you&#39;ll want to use Accio to pull the blocks on the ground to the right wall, then push them forward with Depulso until they hit the spot with a switch. Climb up using the blocks on your left to get a better angle to drag the blocks from the right wall to you with Accio.

                  How To Find (&amp; Solve) Depulso Puzzle Room 2 In Hogwarts Legacy   To beat Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Depulso Puzzle Room 2, players must solve tough block puzzles with Accio and Depulso, and perfect their platforming skills.   

This should form a path forward, allowing you to use Basic Cast on the switch from the three blocks moved earlier to reset the room. The blocks you moved at the start will return to their original positions, letting you move them to the left wall instead of the right. The final step is to pull the blocks toward you, forming a final path and platform to reach the top of the area in Hogwarts Legacy.




The last cosmetic item found at the top is Herodiana&#39;s Cap, which surprisingly puts together the whole outfit without using the transmog system. Show every cosmetic collected to Sophronia Franklin to finish the quest. Those who solve each of Herodiana&#39;s puzzles in Hogwarts Legacy will earn plenty of XP from their efforts and make an enthusiastic Ravenclaw student very happy.
