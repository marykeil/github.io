# One BG3 Update Changes Romance For The Better, But Undercuts The Commitment


## SUMMARY 



  Patch 5 in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 makes it easier to recruit Minthara, regardless of player alignment, making it easier to romance her as well.   The easier recruitment of Minthara, however, takes away the unique draw of an evil playthrough in the game and undermines the commitment required for her story.   While the change is a response to player demand, it makes Minthara feel less unique as a companion.

## Literature Review

As of the fifth major patch for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, one of the game&#39;s romances has been made easier to access - and also less of a commitment.




Along with the other big additions brought by the fifth major update for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Patch 5 has also made it significantly easier to recruit Minthara without needing to commit to an &#34;evil&#34; playthrough. Released months after the game&#39;s initial launch, Patch 5 brings possibly the largest changes to the game yet, in the form of a playable epilogue and two new difficulty settings - the extra-challenging Honour Mode and the modular Custom Mode. With those major additions, though, the game has also introduced, as usual, a number of smaller fixes and adjustments.




Prior to the Patch 5 update for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Minthara, a drow Paladin under the thrall of the Absolute, could only normally be recruited on &#34;evil&#34; playthroughs - or, at least, on playthroughs where the party didn&#39;t side with the tiefling refugees. In cases where players successfully raided the grove with Minthara and the goblins, or simply moved on to later portions of the game without even picking a side, they would then get the opportunity to save her and recruit her to the party at Moonrise Tower in the second act. As of the most recent major patch, however, Minthara can be recruited (and romanced) even when siding with the tieflings and taking out the goblin camp&#39;s leaders.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Patch 5 For Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Makes Recruiting &amp; Romancing Minthara Easier 
         




However, while allowing players to recruit Minthara regardless of their Act 1 alignment means that a larger audience will get to experience her story, it also somewhat undercuts the commitment that used to be necessary for it. &#34;Evil&#34; playthroughs in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and in most games with similar moral decisions, tend to be the less picked option, often relegated to subsequent playthroughs of the game or not done at all, and making Minthara recruitable regardless of player alignment has the unfortunate side effect of taking away one of the unique draws of an evil playthrough of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3: How To Romance Minthara   Minthara is a ruthless Drow leader who you can surprisingly romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as long as your character fights within a deadly goblin raid.   



 Minthara&#39;s Easier Recruitment Makes Her Less Unique 
          




Whereas most companions and party members in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are introduced organically through the story, and players are given the opportunity to recruit them through dialogue, Minthara is instead more like a &#34;secret&#34; party member - as one of the leaders of the goblin camp, many first-time players with no prior knowledge are likely to simply fight and kill her as a boss in the first act, thereby locking off her story for the rest of the game. Even in the case that she&#39;s sided with, Minthara doesn&#39;t become recruitable until the game&#39;s second act, where in many cases she and Halsin are mutually exclusive.

These various limitations made Minthara hard to recruit for most players, but also contributed to making her feel like a unique companion and romance option - especially after an early hotfix patch restored much of her initially bugged dialogue. Of course, Minthara still has other unique aspects, being the only drow party member, the only one who starts as a paladin, and the only one who can be turned over from the side of the Absolute, but previously the only context that she would be a party member in was if players had at least started to go through an evil playthrough.




It&#39;s important to note, though, that recruiting Minthara in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is still relatively convoluted in good playthroughs, requiring players to take actions that they most likely wouldn&#39;t without already having prior knowledge of how to recruit her. Doing so requires the use of non-lethal attacks, a feature that has relatively few use cases, especially not on an NPC that the game primarily presents as an enemy boss - most other cases where non-lethal damage comes into play are with obviously mind-controlled enemies, such as the two masked victims that can be saved from Ethel in the first and third acts, respectively.



 Minthara&#39;s Easier Recruitment Might Be A Response To Player Demand 
          

Additionally, while making Minthara recruitable on good playthroughs might dampen the unique aspects of both her character and of evil playthroughs in general, the change is essentially an acknowledgment of what the playerbase wanted. Aside from mods that easily allow the party to recruit Minthara on any playthrough (provided she&#39;s left alive), players have also previously made use of a creative exploit to recruit her on non-evil playthroughs anyway, which the most recent major update drastically simplified.




Prior to the patch, players would take the same initial steps - knocking her out with non-lethal damage after making her temporarily hostile. Then, after gaining access to the spell Polymorph and Dominate Beast, players could return to her location in the goblin camp and turn her into a sheep with Polymorph, and then cast Dominate Beast on her to make her a &#34;party member&#34;. Finally, upon entering Moonrise Tower with the polymorphed Minthara, the usual scene of Ketheric Thorm putting her on trial would play (with Minthara still as a sheep), and from there players could recruit her normally by freeing her from the tower&#39;s prison.



Other methods of recruiting Minthara on non-evil playthroughs, or of recruiting her and Halsin at the same time, had previously been entirely patched out of the game.




Although this method allowed players to recruit Minthara outside of evil playthroughs, it was imperfect and buggy, and could often end up not working as intended. Therefore, the patch making Minthara recruitable by simpler means on non-evil playthroughs can be seen as more of a quality-of-life update than an entirely new addition to the game. Additionally, with her recruitment conditions still being fairly convoluted, it&#39;s unlikely that many players who will end up recruiting her after the patch aren&#39;t those who would&#39;ve used the previous method (or a mod) to recruit on non-evil playthroughs anyway.




As Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 continues to receive updates, it&#39;s possible that some other contentious, but largely intentional parts of the game might be subject to change. Similarly to the epilogue removing much of the ambiguity surrounding certain endings, or to Minthara&#39;s recruitability being decoupled from evil playthroughs, aspects of BG3 that players usually try to circumvent, or which are commonly subject to complaints, might be smoothed over in future patches. And, while this might detract from some of what makes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 unique, it&#39;s also a sign of a developer that&#39;s in tune with the wishes of its players.
