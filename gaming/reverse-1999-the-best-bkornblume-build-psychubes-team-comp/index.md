## Literature Review

Bkornblume is an excellent DPS support in Reverse 1999. She focuses on opening enemies up to extra Reality DMG and requires niche team comps.





Part of Bkornblume&#39;s appeal is her simple play style. She weakens the field and leaves it open to those with Reality-based attacks to pick them off. This restricts her to Reality-centric teams, but since some of the best DPS and survival-oriented characters also deal with Reality DMG, this isn&#39;t a major downside. Bkornblume needs to be built as a DPS support.




                  Reverse 1999: The Best X Build (Psychubes &amp; Team Comp)   X is a solid dispeller and crowd controller character in Reverse 1999. His best builds play on his debuffs and encourage teams that weaken enemies.    


 The Best Psychubes For Bkornblume 
         

Unlike X&#39;s build in Reverse 1999, Bkornblume&#39;s best 5-Star Psychube option may actually rank above her 6-Star options. Yearning Desire has the same extra DMG trigger as Bkornblume&#39;s attack, Watch Your Sleeves. In both the Psychube and Incantation, she deals extra DMG if Bkornblume&#39;s target has a negative status or lowered stats (like the lowered Reality DEF from the debuff Incantation, Prying Ear). With Watch Your Sleeve, the bonus is up to 75%, while Yearning Desire increases DMG Dealt by up to 16%. Yearning Desire also provides a 15% Incantation Might bonus, further fueling her excellent attack.




Another reason Yearning Desire works so well for Bkornblume is that its specific trigger makes it unuseful for characters who don&#39;t debuff enemies. While the other Psychube options may provide higher stats, if you need help to get high-ranking Psychubes, you may want to save these Psychubes for your main DPS characters. Otherwise, you may be wasting the Psychube&#39;s full potential.

If you want something with higher stats than Yearning Desire, look at Bkornblume&#39;s 6-Star options. Kit out of all the 6-Star Psychubes available at the global launch of Reverse 1999, Brave New World works best for Bkornblume. This Psychube lends toward an Ultimate-centric play style, providing an Ultimate Might bonus of up to 18%. Its Amplification only triggers after Bkornblume uses her Ultimate. The next Incantation following her Ultimate will have up to 40% more Incantation Might.



If she follows up her Ultimate with Prying Ear, this will increase the amount of Reality DEF her enemies lose while increasing their DMG Taken.







Hopscotch is another good option for Bkornblume, although this Psychube requires her to have the killing blow on enemies to trigger the Amplification. If Bkornblume manages to defeat an enemy, she will get a stack of up to &#43;8% Ultimate Might. She can get up to four stacks before the count tops off. Hopscotch makes it easier for Bkornblume to trigger its Amplification by giving her up to 18% Incantation Might. Hopscotch is a well-rounded Psychube that increases all of Bkornblume&#39;s attacks, especially her stronger Ultimate.

Bkornblume should be on a team with a healer, but if you want to give her a way to heal herself, His Bounden Duty supports Heal and ATK. Whenever Bkornblume defeats an enemy, she can heal herself by up to 120% of her ATK. Since she is a DPS support, this Amplification pairs well with her kit. His Bounden Duty also provides a 12% general DMG Bonus to further support Bkornblume&#39;s DPS prowess.



 The Best Team Comps For Bkornblume 
         




Bkornblume&#39;s team comps in Reverse 1999 are restricted to Reality DMG characters, as Mental DMG characters won&#39;t benefit from her debuffs. Bkornblume&#39;s job in the team is to provide secondary DMG while weakening enemies. Because of that, her survival character will need good utilities while her main DPS joins her in the onslaught.

Starting with the main DPS characters, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with Centurion in Reverse 1999. Centurion and Bkornblume go together like sisters. While Centurion&#39;s strong, Moxie-fueled attacks tear into the enemy lines, Bkornblume cuts openings to make her job easier. Their attacks synergize well together, although you must consider which character needs to deal with killing blows. Considering Centurion may be the best DPS, having these two together is a perfect dynamic duo.

A Knight from Reverse 1999 is also a great main DPS to pair with Bkornblume. This disembodied pair of gauntlets focuses on last-hitting enemies to build Moxie and unleash a grand Ultimate attack. A Knight doesn&#39;t work well if Bkornblume has Hopscotch or His Bounden Duty equipped, as they can&#39;t trigger their special effects.






If Bkornblume has Yearning Desire or Brave New World, she regains synergy with A Knight and can improve the effectiveness of his attacks. This improvement increases A Knight&#39;s chances of last-hitting enemies and getting his bonuses.




You will need a Reality-oriented survival character to fit Bkornblume&#39;s play style. Out of all the top-tier healers who deal Reality DMG in Reverse 1999, Balloon Party is one of the best choices to help Bkornblume and her main DPS. Balloon Party heals based on a percentage of Lost HP, making bringing allies back from the brink easy. She also gives out excellent buffs for team comps with Bkornblume and A Knight. While she takes some investment to work fully, she&#39;s worth it.

Tennant is a solid alternate survival character who fits into team comps with Centurion at Insight 3 and Bkornblume (when the latter has His Bounden Duty equipped). Rather than healing her allies, Tennant spawns a strong shield over all allies for one round. The shield reduces all DMG Taken by 20%. When she isn&#39;t protecting her friends, Tennant prepares her Ultimate, which gives her two stacks of Diamond Bullets. This status reduces the targeted enemy&#39;s Reality DEF, similar to Bkornblume&#39;s debuffs. Tennant may not restore HP, but she synergizes well with Bkornblume.




All these team comps revolve around striking weakened enemies with naturally strong Reality attacks. If enemies have a naturally high Reality DEF, Bkornblume can give her team a leg-up and a chance to ignore this obstacle. She truly is one of the best support characters in Reverse 1999.
