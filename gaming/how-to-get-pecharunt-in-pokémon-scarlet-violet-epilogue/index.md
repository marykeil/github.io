Here’s how to unlock the encounter with Pecharunt in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, tips on how to beat it, and the best Poké Ball to catch it in.





This article contains spoilers for the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue: Mochi Mayhem.




There, players will experience a short story involving a mystery plaguing Mossui Town&#39;s residents and will have the chance to encounter and catch Pecharunt. Pecharunt is a dual Poison- and Ghost-type Pokémon that has been pulling some strings for a while and is associated with the Legendary Pokémon Ogerpon, also from the land of Kitakami. Before catching Pecharunt, however, you will have to unlock its encounter.

                  Do This First In Indigo Disk DLC If You Want A New Pokémon ASAP   There are several new Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but getting Hydrapple can be a lot easier if one fight is completed first.   


 How To Unlock The Pecharunt Encounter 
Location: Kitakami
         

To unlock your encounter with Pecharunt and eventually catch it, you will first need to progress through the story of Mochi Mayhem. To get started, you will need to claim a Key Item called Mythical Pecha Berry from the Mystery Gift function and then interact with a pink plush doll at Peachy’s store, right next to the Community Center in the land of Kitakami. This will start Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue.






You can claim the Key Item from Mystery Gift before finishing the DLCs, but you will need to wrap up the main story of The Indigo Disk before being able to initiate the Mochi Mayhem Epilogue.




You will have to progress through the short hour-long campaign, enduring a series of tough battles against several trainers, including some of your own allies, who have fallen under the influence of Pecharunt’s Toxic Chain. The story will take you to up to where the shrine of the Loyal Three was, overlooking Mossui Town. You will have to beat Nemona, who has been brainwashed by Pecharunt in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue and, upon her defeat, you can initiate the encounter with the peach-shaped Mythical Pokémon itself.

                  Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests   In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.   






 How To Beat Pecharunt 
Pecharunt&#39;s Type: Poison- and Ghost-type
          

The fight against Pecharunt is given the boss encounter treatment, and you will need to deplete this bar without having all your Pokémon faint to catch Pecharunt. As a dual Poison- and Ghost-type Pokémon, Pecharunt is weak against Ground-, Ghost-, Psychic-, and Dark-type moves.



Pecharunt is at level 88, so it is best to bring a fully trained team at level 100 to face it and ensure victory. In any case, save your game before interacting with the Mythical Pokémon and starting the boss fight.




There is one mechanic you should be wary about, however. Pecharunt’s strategy revolves around poisoning opponents. With Toxic or its signature move, Malignant Chain, Pecharunt can inflict the poisoned status effect against your Pokémon. This comes with a bonus thanks to the Mythical creature’s Poison Puppeteer Ability, which sees Pokémon that Pecharunt poisons also become confused. By being poisoned and confused in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, your Pokémon will have a reduced chance of landing attacks and sustain much more damage from Pecharunt.




                  One Reason Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Needs More DLC After Indigo Disk   Even with the release of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk expansions, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players deserve at least one more DLC. Here’s why.   



To bypass Pecharunt’s Poison-based techniques and still hit it with super effective moves, you should consider using a strong Steel- and Dark-type Pokémon, such as Kingambit.




Steel- and Dark-type Pokémon will allow you to be immune to Pecharunt&#39;s poisoned status effect and Poison-type moves while hitting hard with dark-type moves. A strong Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon would also work, were it not for Pecharunt’s usage of Shadow Ball, a Ghost-type Pokémon that can immediately knock out some of the most sturdy creatures, like Metagross or Iron Crown.

The fight against Pecharunt is not particularly hard, especially because it does not Terastallize, nor does it have any hidden mechanic other than its special Poison Puppeteer Ability. As with any Mythical Pokémon encounter, it is best to play it safe, prepare your team, and save the game. Once Pecharunt’s boss-like HP bar is fully depleted, you can catch it in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Mochi Mayhem Epilogue.




                  One Change Could Make Pokémon Gen 10&#39;s Open-World Games Even Better   Although they may be years away, there is already a change in Gen 10 Pokémon games that could make their open-world maps a lot better for players.   



 How To Catch Pecharunt 
Best Poké Ball: Master Ball
          

After defeating Pecharunt, you can catch it in the game. This is even signaled by your rival and friend, Kieran, who screams out to catch it in a Poké Ball. There is no secret here. Pecharunt’s catch is guaranteed, so you may choose whatever type of Poké Ball you prefer. If you want something more sophisticated, then Pecharunt may as well be a worthy Master Ball catch in Pokémon Indigo Disk.



Pecharunt is Shiny locked, which means that, even though its Shiny form exists in the game’s code, it cannot be obtained through legal methods, like playing the Epilogue.







When caught, Pecharunt will be at level 88. It has a set Poison Tera-type and knows the following moves: Nasty Plot (Dark-type), Toxic (Poison-type), Malignant Chain (Poison-type), and Shadow Ball (Ghost-type). Its only Ability is Poison Puppeteer. Although not strong, Pecharunt can be a nuisance if properly trained and built for competitive matches or even Tera Raids. The creature is rare and will likely be unavailable through other methods for quite some time, so it is best to catch Pecharunt as soon as possible in the Epilogue episode for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
