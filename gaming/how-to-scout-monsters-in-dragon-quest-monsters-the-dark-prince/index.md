## Literature Review

Recruiting monsters to your party in Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince requires you to scout them with a show of force from your team of allies.





Nearly 500 different new and returning monsters in Dragon Quest Monsters: TDP can be interacted with throughout your adventure. The main character, Psaro, cannot attack monsters, meaning the only way to battle is through a team of allies gained in their travels. You start with one monster companion at your side as you seek out the most powerful creatures to wander across the land of Nadiria.




                  &#34;A Standout RPG&#34; - Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince Review   Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince gives backstory to one of DQ&#39;s coolest villains and shows the best of what monster-wrangling games can offer.   


 How To Recruit Monsters In Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince 
          

When you fight enemy monsters, you can scout them by displaying a &#34;Show of Force&#34; that has a chance to recruit a selected target based on your party&#39;s strength. In Dragon Quest Monsters: TDP, you can pick the &#34;Scout&#34; option from the &#34;Orders&#34; menu on your turn. Select which monster you want to scout to see the chances of your team&#39;s display working on that enemy.



Fights in this game typically showcase 1â€“4 monsters in a single battle. Combat lasts until all enemies are defeated, 20 rounds have passed, or all your recruited monsters lose.







If your team has higher-level monsters, your chances of recruiting low-level enemies can be extremely high in Dragon Quest Monsters: TDP. Another way to increase your Display of Strength chances is to win tournaments or progress through the main story. Beating bosses from the story will increase Psaro&#39;s reputation, making scouted monsters more likely to join you.

Unless your target&#39;s scout chance is 100%, there is a possibility your recruitment efforts will fail. This will cause the enemy you scouted to become angered or irritated, locking you from scouting them again. This forced fighting breaks a series tradition in Dragon Quest Monsters: TDP, making combat an optional encounter instead of a guaranteed part of exploration in the world.

If you manage to scout too many monsters in Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, you can put some in your Reserves as backup allies instead of your Main Party.
