## Literature Review

Just because Disney Dreamlight Valley is officially out doesn’t mean the devs are slowing down. Its 2024 roadmap is full of new content.




Disney Dreamlight Valley has had a big year in 2023, culminating with the full release of the game in early December alongside its new Expansion Pass DLC, A Rift In Time. That doesn&#39;t mean the developers are planning on slowing down, however, with not one but two roadmaps that are full of planned content coming to both the base game and the expansion pass in 2024. These scheduled content drops are in addition to any periodic updates and patches, and there will continue to be regular Star Path events to give even more goodies for players to enjoy.




On December 5, 2023, Disney Dreamlight Valley had its official game launch after having been in early access for a year. This release also came with a large update that added multiplayer and brought Jack Skellington to the Valley, as well as kicking off the first expansion pass DLC. Despite the paid expansion having an announced three chapters that will be opened over the course of several months, the roadmap for 2024 includes many new bits of fun content, including new villagers, that will apply to the base game and not require the purchase of the A Rift In Time expansion pass.

The first planned content drop for 2024 will happen in late winter and will unlock a new Realm Door in the castle. This door will lead to the Laugh Floor where players will be introduced to Mike Wazowski and Sulley from Monsters, Inc. and have a chance to invite them to come to the Valley. Following that update, there will be another in early spring that states that a vibrant new Villager will move in, with hints leaning towards this mystery addition being Daisy Duck.

 Date  Update   Late Winter 2024  New Realm: The Laugh Floor, introducing Mike and Sulley from Monsters, Inc. to the Valley.   Early Spring 2024  A new &#34;vibrant&#34; villager, possibly Daisy Duck, arrives.   Late Spring 2024  New Realm, possibly from Mulan due to hints at it being related to a &#34;Dynasty&#34;.   Summer 2024  Princess Tiana from The Princess and the Frog arrives in the Valley along with new recipes.   



Late spring and summer will bring two more content drops to Disney Dreamlight Valley, including new characters. Princess Tiana from The Princess and the Frog is a confirmed addition for the summer and will bring new cooking recipes.

Expansion Pass Content
          

Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s paid Expansion Pass, A Rift In Time began with Chapter One, &#34;Welcome To Eternity Isle&#34; on December 5, 2023. This began the story of Jafar&#39;s interference with the workings of time, gave the new Royal Hourglass tool, and introduced Rapunzel, Gaston, and EVE to the world. Acts Two and Three are still to come in future months, slowly doling out more of the story of Jafar&#39;s schemes.



The expansion pass only has to be purchased once to access all three chapters as they release.







Not much exact information has been given yet as to what these two additional portions of the Expansion Pass will bring, yet in Spring 2024, there will be at least one more Villager added to the game.

 Date  Update   Currently Available  Eternity Isle is opened with Rapunzel, Gaston, and EVE introduced. Chapter 1 of Jafar&#39;s A Rift In Time story begins.   Spring 2024  Chapter 2 of A Rift In Time lets players further explore Ancient&#39;s Landing. A new villager is added.   Summer 2024  The final chapter of A Rift In Time repairs Jafar&#39;s damage and foils his schemes.   



The finale of A Rift In Time&#39;s storyline will be revealed in the Summer, as Jafar&#39;s plans are finally put to rest and the rift in time is repaired. Every other scheduled content reveal has included a new villager being added, so there will likely be one added in Summer as well, though that has not been confirmed at this time.

                  Disney Dreamlight Valley Finally Has Multiplayer, But There Are Some Issues   Multiplayer has been a feature that many have looked forward to having in Disney Dreamlight Valley, but in its current state, it isn’t very useful.   




In addition to all these mapped-out plans of content drops to the game, the currently disappointing Valley Visit multiplayer mode will continue to receive more work to allow players to do more while in multiplayer, yet no exact timeframe has been given for when this will take place. The popular event Star Paths will also continue to rotate through the months, giving more cosmetics and goals for players to aim for. Just because it is out of Early Access, Disney Dreamlight Valley certainly does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon, which delivers lots of exciting opportunities for players throughout the coming months.
