## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a massive game, and that results in a few, minor pieces of the story not making complete sense, such as these 10 things.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a massive game that weaves together countless side stories along with its main plot, making the world of Faerûn feel alive and fleshed out. But with such a large scope and an enemy that threatens the entire plane, it&#39;s natural that there will be a few plot holes spread throughout the three acts. These plot holes might not affect the story as a whole, but they might leave Tav scratching their head and wondering why nobody seems to care about those missing details.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is an award-winning game, and its cast helped breathe life into the characters through their fantastic performances. But even the best games aren&#39;t immune to plot holes or details that simply don&#39;t make much sense. These plot holes might not make a big difference in the grand scheme of the story, but they might be worth pondering.
 : &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review









 








 10  Everyone Ignores The Absolute Brand 
A Powerful Boon No One Talks About
        

A member of the party can receive the brand of the Absolute from Priestess Gut in Act 1. While this can be useful to get the effect of the magic item that Priestess Gut drops in order to cast Aid, that seems to be the only use that the brand has. After receiving the brand, no party member ever brings up the topic again, and the topic never comes up with random NPCs either. In the end, it seems forgotten.





 9  Eating Tadpoles Only Has Benefits 
They Give The Party Illithid Powers With No Downside
        

The Emperor in the Astral Prism allegedly keeps the party from undergoing ceremorphosis, and he encourages them to take the tadpoles that create mind flayers from the dead and consume them. Having a brain full of worms seems like a bad idea, but it instead gives characters extra abilities. Only the Astral-Touched Tadpole in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a bigger effect, and that&#39;s mostly in the form of black veins on the faces of any character that uses it.





 8  Jaheira &amp; Minsc Should Be More Powerful 
Returning Characters From Baldur&#39;s Gate 2
        

As part of the party in Baldur&#39;s Gate 2, Jaheira and Minsc in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 should have god-like powers that have been retained from their previous adventure. However, this plot hole can be explained as a product of gameplay necessity. If Jaheira and Minsc retained their abilities and levels from BG2, then the balance needed for combat would be disrupted.





 7  Shadowheart&#39;s Powers 
Clerics Require A Patron Deity


 







As a cleric, Shadowheart gets her powers from her goddess, who, at least in the beginning, is Shar. However, Act Two gives Shadowheart the options to turn her back on Shar, and as a Cleric, this should mean that her powers are revoked as well, since Shar would be the source of her strength. It could be explained away as Selûne accepting her return, but that seems odd for the period where Shadowheart is uncertain where she stands between the twin goddesses.





 6  Mephistopheles Should Care About Cazador&#39;s Ascension Being Stopped 
Mephistopheles Was Promised 7,000 Souls
        

Mephistopheles is the archdevil who made a deal with Cazador, giving him the chance to become a Vampire Ascendant in exchange for seven thousand souls. Considering the number of souls he stands to lose, it&#39;d make sense for Mephistopheles to be pretty upset if the party stops the ritual and frees the spawn. However, he&#39;s never mentioned beyond being the partner for Cazador&#39;s ritual and the one who would stand to gain from their deal.





 5  Astarion&#39;s Vampirism 
The Tadpole&#39;s Effects Are Selective


 







Astarion receives more benefits than any other character when it comes to the tadpoles. It removes most of the drawbacks of his vampirism, letting him walk in the sun and enter houses without an invitation. However, the only aspect of being a vampire it doesn&#39;t remove is his hunger for blood. It can seem strange that the tadpole is capable of essentially curing him of every associated effect except his need for blood.





 4  Karlach&#39;s Infernal Machine 
There Should Be Enough Resources To Fix It


 







If Dammon is experienced enough to pick up what&#39;s wrong with Karlach&#39;s machine from listening to it, he should have the ability to find a way to fix it in a way that makes it run cooler, letting her stay out of Avernus. At the same time, the party has multiple healers, so that would be her best chance to have any extensive procedures done to fix her engine or replace it with one that can run on the material planes. However, she stays bereft of options for avoiding Avernus.





 3  The Emperor&#39;s Allegiance 
He&#39;s Quick To Join The Elder Brain
        

The Emperor is strongly against freeing Orpheus, and he lets the party know this more than once through the last act. At the same time, he spends the entire game helping the party stay in their normal forms and guiding them, so they can defeat the Elder Brain. However, if the party frees Orpheus and decides to work with him in the end, then the Emperor joins the Elder Brain against the party. After his actions throughout the game, it seems like a quick switch of allegiances because he disagrees about Orpheus being freed.





 2  Orpheus Changes After Freeing Him 
Githyanki Despies Illithids
        

If the party doesn&#39;t have members willing to undergo ceremorphosis after they free Orpheus, he&#39;s willing to become a mind flayer himself. Considering they&#39;re told that being an illithid is the worst thing that can happen to a githyanki, and Orpheus is particularly hateful towards them, it seems strange that he becomes one so easily. Also, he was trapped because of his power to stop ceremorphosis, so his death would presumably remove the only person who seems to have that power.





 1  Ceremorphosis 
Not Every Tadpole Leads To An Illithid
        

There are multiple characters who are infected with the tadpoles outside the party who don&#39;t undergo ceremorphosis. It seems like being a servant of the Absolute keeps the process at bay, but then, at the end, if the party chooses to side with the brain, the people of Baldur&#39;s Gate undergo rapid ceremorphosis. If the Absolute wants to take over more cities beyond Baldur&#39;s Gate, it seems like it would be a better idea to keep a number of the population in their mortal form, so they can take the other cities by surprise instead of launching a full illithid attack on them.
Given the size of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and the complexity that goes into designing a game with so many branching paths, a number of plot holes ending up in the game is understandable. Since there&#39;s unlikely to be DLC or expansions, these mysteries are currently fated to go unanswered, unless a patch takes up the task of addressing them. Either way, the plot holes aren&#39;t game breaking, and the game as a whole more than makes up for the few pieces that don&#39;t make sense in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
