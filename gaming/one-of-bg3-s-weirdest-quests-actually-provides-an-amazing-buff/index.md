## Literature Review

Strength can come from some surprising places in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and one particularly unusual avenue yields especially exciting dividends.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has no shortage of interesting ways to make characters more powerful, but some of the best options can be hard to come across. Although it isn&#39;t surprising that it&#39;s easy to miss secrets in a game of its size and scope, it&#39;s still notable when something is hidden behind an unusual method that the majority of players might be unlikely to uncover. One excellent buff, in particular, requires a very specific series of steps, and following them to the letter can unlock a potentially permanent advantage.




Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the best time to secure powerful boons, as getting a leg up before the challenges of Act 2 and beyond can make them much easier to tackle. However, most equipment, weapons, and potions that can be gathered that early can eventually get outmoded by later acquisitions. A status effect, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t take up any kind of slot, with the potential to stack effects as long as they&#39;re unique. Many will disappear after basic triggers — a long rest, for example — but some can last much longer thanks to more specific requirements.

 Loviatar&#39;s Love Is An Amazing Buff In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Loviatar&#39;s Love might sound like the name of a potion intended to stir up romantic feelings in a target, but it&#39;s actually a powerful status effect in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This effect triggers whenever the character it&#39;s applied to falls below 30% of their maximum health, granting &#43;2 to attacks and saving throws when they do. This offers a substantial advantage in combat, making it easier to hit enemies and avoid deleterious spells and effects. It&#39;s theoretically possible to keep this around for the full game, but there&#39;s a catch — if the character dies, Loviatar&#39;s Love dies with it.




Considering the advantage of Loviatar&#39;s Love only comes into play at lower HP numbers, using its advantages without losing it can require a tightrope balancing act that&#39;s hard to maintain. Applying it to a glass cannon character is especially unlikely to last long, as 30% of an average wizard&#39;s health isn&#39;t very much at all. It could provide some major fun with a more robust barbarian, but healing them just enough to keep them alive and in the ideal range might be a full-time job for another party member. Losing Loviatar&#39;s Love isn&#39;t the end of the world, as many parties will never come across it to begin with, but it&#39;s a big advantage for as long as it can be maintained.

The saving grace of the situation is that being downed isn&#39;t enough to break the status effect, as a character has to fail their death saving throws for Loviatar&#39;s Love to say farewell. Played carefully, it&#39;s definitely possible to avoid most deaths in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but trying to maintain Loviatar&#39;s Love could add a bit of extra stress to a situation that would usually only mean a wasted Scroll of Revivify. It&#39;s consequently best to treat it as a nice advantage while it lasts rather than something to permanently rely on, and there are plenty of other ways to build up a character&#39;s strength in combat.






 Getting Loviatar&#39;s Love In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Is Weird 
         

The opportunity to acquire Loviatar&#39;s Love in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Act 1 can be found in the Shattered Sanctum, a partially ruined complex within the Goblin Camp. One occupant of this area is Abdirak, who can be found near the torture room of the sanctum thanks to his interest in pain. As a servant of Loviatar, the goddess of agony who serves the god Bane, Abdirak offers pain to the party as a way to convey the intimate pleasure that he finds in the worship of his goddess.

It&#39;s possible to refuse Abdirak outright, but deciding to accept his uncomfortable offer is the only way to receive the blessing that he offers. Abdirak will then ask the character in the conversation to face the wall before pulling out a mace to hit their back. There are three different options to react to the pain, relying on Constitution, Performance, and Intimidation. Ignoring the Constitution option is necessary to get Loviatar&#39;s Love, as succeeding those checks will result in a stoic reaction that disappoints Abdirak.






It&#39;s best to seek out Abdirak early in the Shattered Sanctum, as initiating combat in the area can make him never offer the proposal.




Sticking to Performance or Intimidation, two ability checks have to pass successfully to satisfy Abdirak and make him offer up Loviatar&#39;s Love. This can be an uncomfortable scene, as Abdirak wants to see pleasure in pain, but it&#39;s worth engaging in for the buff. Reading a nearby book also makes it possible to choose what weapon Abdirak will use for the practice, although this isn&#39;t necessary to succeed any of the checks. One trick that will offer an advantage is stripping down, as bare provides a buff to the Performance and Intimidation options.

Although going through with Abdirak&#39;s offer might not be the right roleplaying choice for every Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 character, there&#39;s no real reason not to take him up on it. The only drawback is the loss of health from several basic weapon attacks, but it&#39;s nothing that can&#39;t be healed up with a couple of spells or health potions. Although some companions view the whole affair more favorably than others, none will actively disapprove of it, so there&#39;s no risk to relationships. The lack of any downsides to the status effect or negative story consequences will make embarking on the potentially uncomfortable venture an easy choice for many parties.



Loviatar&#39;s Love isn&#39;t a buff so crucial that missing out on the Abdirak encounter will ruin a playthrough, but it is a nice thing to know about, considering its overall benefits.

Loviatar&#39;s Love isn&#39;t a buff so crucial that missing out on the Abdirak encounter will ruin a playthrough, but it is a nice thing to know about, considering its overall benefits. Although the method of acquiring the advantage is certainly atypical compared to most video game quests, Abdirak&#39;s general villainy doesn&#39;t particularly bleed through into the encounter, as he&#39;ll respect a player&#39;s decisions either way. Even if it might seem wise to avoid the weirder encounters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Loviatar&#39;s Love shows that they can sometimes pay major dividends.
