## Literature Review

Players can collect Rough Sapphires and unlock new power recipes in LEGO Fortnite. They can also convert them to Cut Sapphire for health regen charms.





Even when you find Rough Sapphire, you will need a unique pickaxe to mine it. Since it is a tough, precious material, you will need to use an Epic Pickaxe to extract it from the ground. If you do not have an Epic Pickaxe, it can crafted by using 8 Obsidian Slabs and 5 Frostpine Rods. Once you have the pickaxe, you are finally ready to get some Rough Sapphire.





 How To Get Rough &amp; Cut Sapphire in LEGO Fortnite 
          

Unlike getting Knotroot in LEGO Fortnite, Sapphires are typically found in icy caves. According to GameSkinny, you can find Right Sapphire on the ceiling of the Frostlands Ice Caves. The Frostlands Biome hosts many dangerous and powerful enemies, so ensure you have sufficient equipment and weapons to deal with the enemies. In addition to enemies, you will also get damaged from the cold, so it is recommended to have some cold-resistant items.



Since the Frostlands Biome has extremely low temperatures, you will need to fire resistance to conserve health. Eat Spicy Peppers or wear an Inner Fire Charm to resist the cold in the Frostlands Ice Caves.




The easiest way to find an Icy cave in LEGO Fortnite is to look for large stone formations in the Forstlands Biome. You can also follow a Firefly, which will eventually lead you to a cave. Once you are near a cave in this frosty region, it will get marked on your map as well. These caves are not easy, and it is recommended to explore them during the latter half of LEGO Fortnite.




The caves in the Frostlands host enemies that can kill you in about two hits, so make sure you are well-prepared. You can find Sapphire deposits on the ceilings and walls inside the cave. They look very similar to Copper but have a slightly different hue. Once you spot a vein of Sapphire, use the Epic Pickaxe to collect large quantities of Rough Sapphire.

How To Get Cut Sapphire
Once you have collected enough Rough Sapphire, you can craft a Cut Sapphire at the Gem Cutter Crafting station. If you donâ€™t have one, you can craft one using 20 Marble Slabs, 5 Rough Amber, 3 Sand Shells, and 5 Sand Claws in LEGO Fortnite.

Once you have 5 Cut Sapphires in LEGO Fortnite, you can use them to craft an Epic Regeneration Charm. This charm will let you regenerate a considerable amount of health over time and is an excellent tool to have to face formidable enemies and bosses later on.
