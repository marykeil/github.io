## Literature Review

Invisible Frames in Minecraft lets you to decorate walls by placing items without any exterior frame, but you&#39;ll need to use a command to claim it.





Certain mods are able to remove Item Frames, making them appear &#34;invisible&#34; as any object placed inside the frame looks like it is seamlessly integrated onto a block. However, it is much easier to install mods to the Java edition of Minecraft due to the third-party content allowed on this system. As a result, you can only apply Invisible Frames to Java edition, making them unavailable in the Bedrock or console versions of the game.




                  10 Best Seeds For Minecraft 1.20 Bedrock Edition   The Bedrock Edition of Minecraft&#39;s 1.20 update has plenty of gorgeous world seeds that could give you one of your best open-world sandbox experiences.   


 How To Use Invisible Frame Commands 
          

A command code is integral to using Invisible Frames, so you must open the chat window or command menu to get started with this process in Minecraft. If you do not have version 1.16 or higher for your game, make sure to update it to the latest version before trying to input a code. Take care to enter the code below exactly as it appears, without any punctuation or spacing errors:

 /give @s item_frame{EntityTag:{Invisible:1}}.   



The next step after this involves giving people permission to access Invisible Frames. This takes a few more codes to do, which demand that you replace the @s in the phrase above with a new letter that designates who gets the Invisible Frame in their inventory. The right phrase could give the item to everyone, or just a single player nearby who needs the extra decoration tool more than others in Minecraft.






 Every Invisible Item Frame Command 
          

 Command Code  Result   @a  The invisible frame will be given to all players on the server.   @e  The invisible frame will be given to all entities on the server.   @p  The invisible frame will be given to the nearest player.   @r  The invisible frame will be given to a random player.   



Typing any of these commands into the right menu will allow an Invisible Frame to show up in the inventory of the player(s) the phrase refers to. While this all sounds like something exclusive to Java edition, specific mods installed in Minecraft on the Bedrock version could replace normal Frames with a transparent item. Essentially, you would be artificially modifying the look of a normal Item Frame, so it only seems invisible.






You do not have to download anything that might change your console or Bedrock edition of Minecraft, since there is a trick involving a command block and armor stand to replace a normal Frame with an invisible one.




A video from YouTube creator VIPmanYT talks about how to download different mods, including the one for Invisible Frames. Thankfully, this one shouldn&#39;t be too complicated when compared to other, extensive mods that change the game on a larger level. A website called CurseForge has a specific mod named Invisible Item Frames that should be exactly what you want to get in Minecraft.
