## Literature Review

December 23rd’s Wordle answer is yet another simple puzzle to solve if players use words that contain multiple vowels in their first few attempts.





You can also use Wordle’s hard mode if you tend to get carried away with random guesses. Since this mode will not let you reuse confirmed letters in other spots, you will be forced to think of words that feature those letters in the same spot. This can be a bit time-consuming, but in the long run, it will help you for future Wordle puzzles. But, if you do not have many attempts left and want to finish the puzzle as fast as possible, you can use the hints below.
