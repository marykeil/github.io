## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 has a secret antagonist, and he may be the most sinister of all its villains. Find out what makes him so bad, and how to meet him.




Forget the Dead Three and their humanoid thralls - the most evil character in Baldur’s Gate 3 is hiding just out of sight. There’s some variation in the characters everyone meets as they travel through the Forgotten Realms. Some of them are hidden behind an evil playthrough of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and only show themselves when certain unsavory choices are made. Others simply lurk in far-off places that most players won&#39;t visit unless they&#39;re looking for some specific kind of trouble. Still others, though, are truly hard to find. Players might only find them when making a particularly complicated, less obvious series of story decisions.




Most would name the scheming Lord Enver Gortash, the kidnapper Orin the Red, or the power-hungry Ketheric Thorm as the most evil characters in Baldur’s Gate 3. These are the game’s primary antagonists, as they factor most prominently in the game&#39;s main quest and repeatedly create wrinkles for Tav and company. But the party encounters plenty of villains, both major and minor. From small-town scammers to tyrannical rulers, there’s no shortage of evil in the Forgotten Realms. However, the game’s most diabolical character is much harder to come by.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Just Made One Major Choice Way Less Appealing   Patch 5 added a secret epilogue for Lae’zel among its many changes, and it makes a major choice at the end of Act 1 worth skipping completely.   


 Who Is BG3&#39;s True Villain? 
Who Is Sceleritas Fel, And How Can Players Find Him?
          




Sceleritas Fel is truly the most sinister character in Baldur’s Gate 3. He’s the devil on Tav’s shoulder, the voice in their head, and the thorn in their side. He&#39;s disgusted by even the smallest act of kindness, and condones the most gruesome acts of murder. However, most players will never even know he exists. In order to encounter Sceleritas Fel at all, players must choose the Dark Urge Origin character at the very beginning of the game. This can&#39;t be changed later - unlike appearance, class, and level-up bonuses, choosing an Origin character (or not choosing one) is completely permanent.

And it&#39;s not a choice to be made lightly. The Dark Urge has murderous tendencies - all of which are encouraged by Sceleritas Fel. They&#39;re taken to random acts of violence, often for no other reason than to cause chaos. They can resist the urge, but that&#39;s not always easy. Killing increases the Dark Urge&#39;s power, granting them access to new and more powerful forms as the game progresses.




All this makes the Dark Urge less than ideal for a first-time player, but an excellent way to shake things up for a repeat visitor to the Forgotten Realms. It&#39;s gory, it&#39;s edgy, and it&#39;s dark, but the Dark Urge storyline can actually be pretty uplifting. If they keep resisting the urge, things can indeed come to a satisfying and happy ending.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: 7 Things You Didn&#39;t Know About Dark Urge   The Dark Urge in Baldur’s Gate 3 opens up a lot of option and details that are absent when choosing to play a custom-made character instead.   

Unless they listen to Sceleritas Fel, that is. Sceleritas simply appears at camp in Act One of a Dark Urge playthrough, immediately after they&#39;ve heartlessly murdered the tiefling bard Alfira. He introduces himself as the Dark Urge&#39;s butler, although the truth of this is somewhat obscure at first. The Dark Urge has amnesia, and remembers nothing of their life before the beginning of the game. But, at least according to Sceleritas, he was once in the Dark Urge&#39;s employ, and he implores them to vent their frustrations by killing him once again.




Sceleritas himself can&#39;t really die - if he&#39;s ever killed, he&#39;ll just pop up at camp again the following morning. However, he repeatedly encourages the Dark Urge to commit murder, with increasingly disastrous results each time. For example, in Act Two, Sceleritas tries to goad the Dark Urge into murdering Isobel, whose protective spell keeps everyone at the Last Light Inn alive. This would make them directly responsible for the deaths of an entire small town, which is evil enough on its own. However, Sceleritas Fel may know more than he initially lets on.



 BG3&#39;s Sceleritas Fel Has Hidden Motives 
         

By the time the Dark Urge arrives at the Bhaal Temple in Act Three, they&#39;ll have learned that, before their amnesia set in, they were a high-ranking member of the Church of Bhaal. This is probably one of the most outright violent factions in the Forgotten Realms: its adherents worship the Lord of Murder, and frequently kill in his name. Disbanding the Church and defeating its leader, Sarevok, was the main goal of the original Baldur&#39;s Gate. And apparently, Sceleritas was trying to lead the Dark Urge to him the whole time.






But apparently, Sarevok didn’t stay dead - he appears alive and well in Baldur’s Gate 3. Players can choose to side with Sarevok and become an Unholy Assassin in Baldur’s Gate 3, whether or not they’ve chosen the Dark Urge Origin character.




When the Dark Urge arrives at the Temple, Sceleritas will welcome them home. Unusually, the butler has a request for his master: to kill Orin the Red, another of Bhaal&#39;s Deathbringers. Apparently, Orin has been mistreating him, a role he&#39;d much rather the Dark Urge fulfill.

Once they do his bidding, Sceleritas transforms into an Avatar of Bhaal, and the voice of the god speaks through him. Well, it&#39;s not much of a transformation: the Avatar of Bhaal looks identical to Sceleritas, just with glowing red eyes. As it turns out, the butler has been Bhaal&#39;s servant since the very beginning. He makes an offer: give the Lord of Murder control over the Elder Brain, and the Dark Urge will be made Bhaal&#39;s chosen. However, this would effectively give Bhaal control over the entirety of the Forgotten Realms.




Once again, the Dark Urge may choose to accept or refuse this mission. Should they accept, they&#39;ll gain the spell power word: kill and the Slayer form if they haven&#39;t gotten them already. Sceleritas will regain control, and gain a measure of prescience. He&#39;ll answer any questions the Dark Urge might have, before they have the opportunity to have him rendered silent or permanently killed. Finally, the Dark Urge will forget everything they ever knew as they become a complete puppet of Bhaal.

If they refuse, Bhaal will simply kill the Dark Urge, having no further use for them. However, they&#39;ll shortly be resurrected by Withers back at camp, only to notice that they&#39;re finally free of the Dark Urge. Sceleritas will stop by to scold them, but he won&#39;t be long for this world. And he&#39;ll finally stay dead this time.

So, how does all of this make Sceleritas Fel the most evil character in Baldur’s Gate 3? He could be called Bhaal’s greatest footsoldier. Characters like Gortash, Ketheric, and Orin are mostly out to set themselves up in positions of power, and are only serving their evil gods as a means to an end. Sceleritas Fel, however, has absolutely nothing to gain. In fact, he has everything to lose if his mission ultimately succeeds. He is evil for evil&#39;s sake, and he may not be an entirely unwitting participant in Bhaal&#39;s plan. Altogether, his selfless commission of evil makes Sceleritas Fel the most loathsome character in Baldur’s Gate 3.
