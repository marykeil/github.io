## Literature Review

Anyone in the late game of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC should prioritize unlocking and making the best use of the Item Printer.





Essentially, the Item Printer allows you to trade different materials for randomly generated items, some of which can be extremely rare. In the long run, this is a great way to farm money, Pokéballs, and other valuable items. So, while many players are focused on acquiring new and rare Pokémon, such as catching a Terapagos, the Item Printer is another object that should be high on their priority list.




                  How To Farm Stellar Tera Shards In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk (The Fast Way)   Stellar Tera Shards are a rare but important item in The Indigo Disk DLC, but you won&#39;t be able to farm them effectively until late in the game.   


 How To Unlock The Item Printer In Indigo Disk DLC 
          

To unlock the Item Printer in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, players first need to beat the base missions in the Indigo Disk and Teal Mask DLC. If you don&#39;t do this, you won&#39;t be able to complete the mission that requires you to catch an Alolan Pokémon, which is the first step toward unlocking the Item Printer.

Right after you complete the aforementioned quest, you&#39;ll unlock BlueBerry Quest for the Academy. You&#39;ll want to progress through these missions until you meet Drayton from the Blueberry Academy Elite Four, and he inducts you into the BB League Club. Once you&#39;re in the BB League Club, you can unlock the Item Printer. Simply access the PC in the League Club Room and donate 200 BP to the Science Club to test the machine. After doing so, you will also gain access to the machine.






 How To Use The Item Printer 
          

After you&#39;ve funded the Item Printer for the Science Club, it will appear right next to the PC in the League Club Room. If you interact with the machine, you&#39;ll discover you need to give it different Pokémon Materials and 10 BP to print a new item.



Unlike the Cram-O-Matic, which had pre-programmed recipes, the Item Printer has no recipes and its rewards are entirely random.




Additionally, the Item Printer can be upgraded three times. The second generation, the &#34;Great Ball,&#34; is unlocked after 30 prints on the base Item Printer and costs 200 BP to upgrade. This upgrade enables the 2x lotto, which allows players to get double the items on a print. The &#34;Ultra Ball&#34; unlocks after printing 80 items and costs 500 BP. This upgrade enables the Pokéball lottery, which allows players to win different balls, such as Master Balls.




The &#34;Master Ball&#34; is the item printer&#39;s third and final upgrade. This final upgrade is available after 100 prints and costs 1000 BP to unlock. The Item Printer, on the other hand, has a chance to print Stellar Tera Shards as a result of this upgrade. So, while each level of the Item Printer grants access to different items, one thing is certain across the board: it&#39;s an extremely useful machine to have access to in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC.
