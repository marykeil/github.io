Combat Strength represents how prepared you are for certain missions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and can be increased in a few different ways.





You can check the Combat Strength of your Na&#39;vi in the &#34;Character&#34; section of the main menu, right next to &#34;Quests&#34; and &#34;Skills.&#34; The upper right corner of the screen will show what Level of Strength you have, right below the icon directing you to the Ubisoft Store for the game. Even after beating Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, this stat will continue to be important regarding postgame activities around the open-world.

Your Combat Strength in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora improves as you craft and equip better gear and unlock new skills for your character. The small bar under your Strength builds as you equip stronger items and weapons. These powerful gear pieces can come from vendors both with the human Resistance and various Na&#39;vi tribes you earn Favor with over the course of your journey.



As you may expect in a large open-world, some weapons and gear are found around the map in locations you travel to. You may also receive strong items from different quest rewards.







As you discover more Tarysu Saplings and finish missions, you&#39;ll gain Skill Points to use on five skill trees tied to your character. Each individual ability on these trees will bolster your Combat Strength somewhat, with expensive traits typically having a larger contribution to your score. Compare and contrast alternate skills and gear to see which ones affect your Strength the most in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

Make sure to try and match your Combat Strength to the score recommended for certain missions, since those quests craft challenges based on score levels. If you don&#39;t like the look of stronger gear that improves your Strength in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, you can always change the cosmetic appearance separately.
