## Literature Review

There are a total of 16 shadow achievements for Cookie Clicker on Steam. These are more difficult to unlock than the regular ones.





Cookie Clicker&#39;s shadow achievements are described as “either unfair or difficult to attain” and require much more effort to unlock than other achievements. This is made even more difficult because some shadow achievements in Cookie Clicker have bizarre prerequisites. For example, the “True Neverclick” shadow achievement requires players to bake one million cookies without clicking the giant cookie even once. For this Cookie Clicker achievement, players will need to exercise some extreme restraint.

Note : usurpers incur a -1% CpS penalty until they rename themselves something else. &#34;But that&#39;s not you, is it?&#34;   In Her Likeness  Shape your clones to resemble grandmas. &#34;There she is.&#34;   Just Plain Lucky  You have 1 chance in 1 million every second of earning this achievement.

While many of Cookie Clicker&#39;s hidden shadow achievements are self-explanatory, some may take some more thinking. For example, players must use Steam&#39;s debug mode cheats to earn the “Cheated cookies taste awful” achievement. This can be done by opening the game’s console (this is done in different ways depending on the system used) and entering Game.cookies = Game.cookiesEarned &#43; &lt;amount&gt;; as the code. Check out the video below from DorikPlays on YouTube to see an easy example of how to hack more cookies into Cookie Clicker for this shadow achievement:


 

Completing these hidden achievements in Cookie Clicker doesn’t contribute to the player&#39;s Milk percentage, but the prestige alone may be enough for players to want to work toward beating them. By the time players reach the “So much to do so much to see” achievement, it’s likely they’ll have unlocked plenty of Cookie Clicker&#39;s shadow achievements already.
