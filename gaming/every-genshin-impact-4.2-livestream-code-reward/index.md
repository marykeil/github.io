## Literature Review

Players can now redeem the special Genshin Impact 4.2 livestream codes and claim free in-game rewards, which include up to 300x Primogems.




The Genshin Impact 4.2 livestream codes are now available, following the start of the special program. Because HoYoverse’s popular action RPG is a live-service title, the game frequently receives updates that add new content to it. The content includes new playable characters, more story missions to play through, events, and even map expansions. Before the updates go live, however, the developer holds a livestream to announce everything new in the following update. Along with the new bits of information, these special events also gift players with promo codes that can be redeemed for in-game prizes.




The rewards often include items such as Mora, Hero’s Wit, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and, most importantly, free Primogems in Genshin Impact. This resource is vital to buy wishes, the currency used for obtaining characters and weapons in the gacha banner system. While the base game does offer a large sum for free via gameplay, it is limited, so any free amount given out can help. In addition to the codes, the livestream also confirmed many of the Genshin Impact 4.2 leaks and rumors that had been shared weeks ago.


 All Genshin Impact 4.2 Livestream Codes &amp; Rewards 
          

As is common with special version events, developer HoYoverse has shared a total of three promo codes during the 4.2 livestream held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch. By redeeming all three codes, players can obtain 50,000x Mora, 10x Mystic Enhancement Ore, 5x Hero’s Wit, and 300x Primogems. The amount of resources offered is not very high, but it can be helpful to finish off leveling characters or weapons. Additionally, the number of Primogems can purchase nearly two Intertwined Fates, which can then be used in the banner system. Although the pity for obtaining 5-star characters and weapons is fairly high, it can be enough to tip the luck in the player’s favor.

 How To Redeem Genshin Impact 4.2 Livestream Codes &amp; Claim Rewards 
          

To redeem the aforementioned codes, players have two options. The first of them is the most straightforward, as it is directly through the game. By opening the main menu and going to the settings, players can scroll down until they find the Account page. Within it, there is a feature called Redemption Code. The next step is to fill in the slot with the Genshin Impact 4.2 codes and click the redeem button. If successful, the respective rewards will be sent to their in-game mailbox to be claimed.




The second way to claim Genshin Impact promo codes is through the official Genshin Impact website. By accessing it and logging in, players can simply fill in the box and redeem the 4.2 livestream codes. Like in the first method, the rewards will be sent to the in-game mailbox and need to be claimed. There is a time limit to redeem the codes, and it is very limited, so Genshin Impact players should hurry to ensure they get the rewards, including the Primogems, for free.
