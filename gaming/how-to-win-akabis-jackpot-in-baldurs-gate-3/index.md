## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players can win Akabi&#39;s Jackpot by stealing the Djinni&#39;s magic ring. This leads to a small side adventure with some useful rewards.





To win the Jackpot, you will have to pickpocket the Djinni Ring from Akabi. If you have a Sleight of Hand Proficiency or Expertise character, you can steal this Ring and turn Invisible to hide from the Djinni. This Ring may not be one of the best Rings in BG3, but it can grant the user the ability to cast Mage Hand. Funnily enough, Akabi uses this very Ring to rig the Wheel of Wonders as well.

Once you equip the Ring, ask Akabi to spin the wheel again. You won&#39;t have to take any action here, as you will automatically win the Jackpot. Unfortunately, Akabi will know that you have somehow cheated him. You can respond to his accusation however you like, but regardless of your choice, he will teleport your character to a distant jungle in Chult. Players can resolve quite a few conflicts with Charisma, but this isn’t one of them.



If your character has the right skills, you can also steal back any Gold you might have spent on previous spins when pickpocketing Akabi.







Only the character who spoke to Akabi will be transported, so your carefully assembled party composition in Baldur’s Gate 3 won’t matter much. However, the Jungle is relatively easy to explore with a high-level character, and some useful items can be found.

Your character will need to use the Portal to return to the Circus, but there are also a couple of useful items as marked on the map above. There are also several hostile Chult Alioramus dinosaurs roaming the area that you will need to kill or sneak around. The Band of the Mystic Scoundrel allows the bearer to cast illusion or enchantment spells as a bonus action after hitting a creature with a weapon attack. It can be found on a skeleton at a small camp to the southwest.

                  10 Hidden Chests In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 With Powerful Rewards   Not every hidden chest in Baldur’s Gate 3 holds good—or useful—rewards, but there are some that are worth hunting down for their powerful prizes.   




Nyrulna is a Legendary Trident that deals both Piercing and Thunder damage. When thrown, it detonates in an explosion of Thunder damage before returning to the character’s hand. On top of that, it provides light, immunity to fall damage, and a 3m bonus to movement speed and jump distance. It can be found in a locked chest right by the Portal.

          

These items are powerful and worth the price of a spin of the Wheel of Wonders. Once you enter the Portal, you will emerge from an outhouse near the Circus. You can confront Akabi again, but he will shut down the Wheel of Wonders, so you can’t make any more spins. Regardless, thanks to a small side adventure in a strange land, your Baldur’s Gate 3 character will still have won Akabi’s Jackpot and found some useful equipment.
