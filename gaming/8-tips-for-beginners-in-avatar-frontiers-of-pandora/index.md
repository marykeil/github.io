## Literature Review

The beautiful open-world presented in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora can be intimidating for beginners. Here&#39;s a few tips to help start your journey.





An easy way to get a better understanding of your surroundings is to turn on tutorials in the settings as you start your adventure. Doing this will pause the game whenever new information or mechanics are introduced to explain how you can move forward. For example, those with tutorials will be shown how to view the enormous map size of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora early, helping them find quest markers fast.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.












 








 8  Use Your Na&#39;vi Senses Often 
Feel the World Around You
        

Your character has an ability called Na&#39;vi Senses that allows you to perceive the land of Pandora differently. A glowing blue field changes your vision to highlight plants, items, creatures, enemies, and pretty much everything you can interact with within the world. This skill functions as a way to narrow down the sheer size of everything you can experience, letting you identify points of interest to pursue.





 7  Experiment with Plant and Animal Recipes 
Won&#39;t Know Until You Try
        

When you use your Na&#39;vi Senses, you will discover a variety of life in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora all across the beautiful landscapes. When you inspect different wildlife, you can find out how to harvest it by hunting or gathering animals and plants. You can bring both back to a Cooking Station to add two ingredients you&#39;ve obtained as raw materials for a meal item.
Meal items crafted from a Cooking Station restore your Energy and give your character a small buff for a short time. You won&#39;t know which plant or animal parts provide which effects from a meal produced until you cook them at least once. 

Plants and animals have unique systems tied to how you harvest their resources. An animal can be taken down with a bow in a &#34;clean hunt&#34; to optimize the meat obtained from them. Plants have delicate parts that must be harvested under optimal conditions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. These conditions are usually tied to whether it&#39;s day, night, or rain in various regions.
            
 
 Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Fixes A Growing Problem With Open-World Games 
Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora isn&#39;t out yet, but one decision could go a long way in making it stand out from the crowd of open-world games.








 6  Find Tarysu Saplings for Skill Points 
Level Up Through Your Ancestors
        

While completing every quest until the end of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora will surely reward you with many Skill Points, Tarysu Saplings will also help your character improve. As you gain more Combat Prowess, you can unlock more Ancestor Skills out of the 12 available. The Saplings you discover facilitate this process, allowing you to obtain many new abilities.





 5  Use Stealth Against RDA Outposts 
Blend Into the Forest


 







The most common quests you&#39;ll find as you work with the Resistance are to disable mining Outposts or bases set up by humans to steal Pandora&#39;s natural resources. The pollution caused by this process must be stopped, but the RDA heavily guards each Outpost. Use your bow to pick off enemies from afar before disabling an Outpost to thin the RDA&#39;s numbers before reinforcements arrive.​​​​​​​





 4  Search for Spare Parts 
Get Money for Better Gear
        

The main currency of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are Spare Parts, which can be given to humans of the Resistance in exchange for better gear. While the items provided by humans may not be as strong as those offered by Na&#39;vi tribes, they are essential for the game&#39;s early stages. You can find Spare Parts by raiding RDA Outposts after you destroy them or from abandoned human bases in the open world.





 3  Build Connections with Other Tribes 
United We Stand as One
        

Similar to Spare Parts, your reputation with different Na&#39;vi clans impacts what items you can get from their people. Earning Favor for a specific tribe allows you to spend some of it on items and crafting designs given by their artisans. The more side quests you complete for an individual group, the more Favor you earn to spend on powerful gear, weapons, and more in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.





 2  Travel with An Ikran Mount 
Fly in the Skies of Pandora


 







The best way to travel is through an Ikran Mount, a multi-winged animal that you will capture and bond with during the main story of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. While it may be tempting to cross the open world on foot, this can get tedious despite the gorgeous scenery of Pandora. Calling upon your Ikran lets you travel faster across the map.
There are other mounts you can use to explore the world of Pandora, including a Direhorse that can run swiftly across the ground and over many obstacles. 

Using an Ikran is also the best way to defog sections of the map you haven&#39;t explored in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Simply going across one location on your flying mount will cut out whole sections of the land, making your map look more connected than ever. This will highlight new areas of interest you can explore for better items and gear for your continuing journey.





 1  Join Up with Friends in Co-Op 
Recruit Fellow Na&#39;vi to the Cause


Although only available after you beat the main story, you can join up with a friend in multiplayer co-op to team up against the RDA and travel through Pandora together. There is Crossplay through this feature, letting you join up with anyone who owns Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora across different systems. All you need to do is set up one player as the Host and then invite others into the world to appear on that player&#39;s map.
According to YouTube creator AndyReloads, quest items, and other gear carry over from a co-op session into another player&#39;s solo adventure. This means two players can progress together through side content or collectible achievements without worrying about doing those activities again in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
While this may only apply to anyone who has graduated from being a beginner in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, there&#39;s no denying that the breathtaking lands of the planet are best experienced with others at your side.
