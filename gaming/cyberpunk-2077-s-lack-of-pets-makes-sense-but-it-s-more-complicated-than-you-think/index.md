# Cyberpunk 2077 s Lack Of Pets Makes Sense, But It s More Complicated Than You Think


## SUMMARY 



  The lack of animal life in Cyberpunk 2077 is due to habitat destruction caused by urban expansion and resource extraction..   Pet ownership in Night City is expensive and restricted, with the ultrarich being the only ones who can afford and maintain pets.   However, V can adopt an iguana and a cat.

## Literature Review

There are a few perfectly good reasons for Cyberpunk’s general lack of pets and wild animals. Here’s everything in the lore to suggest why.




There aren&#39;t many animals around in Cyberpunk 2077, but there&#39;s a perfectly good reason for that. Compared to the average open-world RPG, there&#39;s relatively little wildlife in and around Night City. Cyberpunk&#39;s urban environment is partially to blame, but even then, there&#39;s almost none of the animal life that&#39;s commonly seen in American cities. There are no pigeons perched on buildings, rats digging through trash, or squirrels climbing up trees. Outside the city, in the wide open space of the Badlands, there aren&#39;t really any animals to be seen, either.




And even then, there&#39;s very little domesticated animal life in Cyberpunk. No cats roaming the alleys, fish tanks in corporate waiting rooms, or dogs out on a walk. Even in major cities, it&#39;s impossible to separate people from their pets. For thousands of years of human society, people have kept animals in their homes, either for practical purposes or unconditional companionship. So why has that practice seemingly stopped by 2077? Was it a cultural shift, or something a little deeper?

                  One Hidden Location In Cyberpunk 2077 Turns It Into A Horror Game   Night City hides a terrifying secret in Cyberpunk 2077. Here’s what it is, where to find it, and how it ties into the wider lore of Phantom Liberty.   


 Most Animals In Cyberpunk Went Extinct Due To Ecological Destruction 
         

Although there are many factors involved, the primary cause for the lack of animal life in Cyberpunk is habitat destruction. An ever-increasing population requires urban expansion, which means development of former wildlife areas outside major cities. But it also requires more resources, which means habitat destruction even away from cities. The wood, stone, and clay on which Night City is built has to come from somewhere, and that often means chipping away at vital animal habitats.




In addition to the direct impact of Night City&#39;s construction on animal life, the burning of combustible fuel has contributed to climate change throughout the world of Cyberpunk. More extreme temperatures harm animal life, either by making the regions they&#39;re endemic to uninhabitable, or by interrupting links in the food chain. By 2077, gasoline has been replaced by an alternative fuel, CHOOH2. CHOOH2 is more efficient than gasoline, and doesn&#39;t emit as many pollutants, but it&#39;s still combustible, and still has a footprint. Plus, it&#39;s necessary to burn more fuel to sustain a larger population, which means that CHOOH2 emissions could easily outpace those of gasoline year for year.



 People Can Have Pets In Cyberpunk, But They&#39;re Expensive 
          

However, that&#39;s not to say that there are no domesticated animals in Night City. People still keep dogs, cats, fish, reptiles, birds, and rodents, but they don&#39;t come cheaply. Per a radio show that can be heard in Cyberpunk 2077, it costs 1,000 Eurodollars a month to keep a pet - the government requires citizens to shell out a monthly renewal fee for a &#34;pet license.&#34; This was likely an intentional way to keep animal populations in Night City, or even the wider New United States, down. Its resources are stretched thin enough in supporting its human inhabitants. Add a few million pets on top, and the economy might collapse.




But even before the pet license, prospective pet parents will have to find an animal to adopt. It doesn&#39;t seem like there are any shelters or SPCAs in Night City, so if someone wants a pet, there are two options: find it or buy it. With the license fees incurred by a single pet already through the roof, it&#39;s unlikely that things like pet breeders or foster homes exist, either. And with the low population of wildlife in general, it&#39;s difficult for most people to find an available pet in the first place.

                  Cyberpunk 2077 Hidden Dogtown Location Reveals More Lore About An Important Decision   A tiny, hidden area in Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty provides a wealth of backstory on an important quest character. Here’s how to find it.   

In the tabletop version of Cyberpunk, megacorporation Biotechnica is here to help. In the 2020s, Biotechnica sold cloned versions of animals to anyone who could pay for them, but they still weren&#39;t cheap. Their offerings ranged from common housepets like dogs, cats, and small birds, to rare and dangerous exotics like leopards, gorillas, and dolphins. By 2077, Biotechnica has mostly pivoted to cyberware and synthetic meat, or scop, the source of most dietary protein in Night City. However, there&#39;s nothing to suggest it&#39;s stopped selling pets - although they&#39;re probably more expensive than ever.




Only the ultrarich are able to afford pets, which is a problem for most in Night City. The average person might keep animated trinkets like small robots or holograms in their apartment, but it&#39;s a poor substitute. However, those who can afford pets can usually also afford cybernetic implants for them, granting them the same kinds of supernatural abilities as human netrunners equipped with the best cyberware. It&#39;s easy to see how this is practical: sensory implants might give a guard dog a better sense of smell, or a tropical fish a brighter coat of colors.



 V Can Get A Cat Or An Iguana In Cyberpunk 
How To Adopt Nibbles In Cyberpunk 2077
          

But the question on everyone&#39;s lips is: if there are pets in Night City, even if they&#39;re not visible, can V adopt one? Yes, it&#39;s possible to adopt a cat or an iguana in Cyberpunk, and even though most players won&#39;t find out how on their own, the adoption process is actually quite easy. If V walks out of their apartment and makes a right, then another right in front of apartment number 721, they&#39;ll find a trash can with a datashard sticking out of it. It&#39;s called &#34;feed teh cat&#34; - spelling errors included - and describes a very complicated feeding routine for a very particular cat.




Thankfully, V won&#39;t have to go through all that, but they will have to buy cat food. The closest place to buy it is at the food stall in Kabuki Market. V can then return to the food bowl, interact with it to place the cat food inside, and pass some time. Sleeping works, but they can also just go complete a few Cyberpunk gigs before coming back to the building. When they check the bowl again, there should be a cat eating out of it. Interact with the cat, and V will take them home - for the rest of the game, they&#39;ll find Nibbles napping around their apartment.



In another Cyberpunk reference to The Witcher 3, a cat named Nibbles also appears in CD Projekt Red&#39;s previous game. Nibbles is also said to be descended from Deathwish, a cybernetically-enhanced cat owned by legendary netrunner Rache Bartmoss.




V can also get a pet iguana in Cyberpunk, although it&#39;s a little harder to pull off. While infiltrating Konpeki Plaza during the main mission &#34;The Heist,&#34; they might find a stray egg lying around Yorinobu Arasaka&#39;s penthouse. They&#39;ll have to complete the next main mission, &#34;Playing for Time,&#34; then place the egg in a bowl in their apartment. After about 100 in-game days, the egg will hatch, and V will have a brand-new pet iguana hanging around. It&#39;s possible to have both Nibbles and the iguana at once, and the two may even interact with each other. And yes, V can pet both the cat and the iguana.




So, while there may not be many pets in Night City, there are undeniably some, even a few that V can adopt. However, environmental catastrophes and expensive fees make pet ownership a distant dream for most, and explain the overall lack of animals. In the end, pet ownership is another privilege reserved for the richest of the rich in Cyberpunk 2077, but one that V can partake in with a little effort.

              Cyberpunk 2077  Based on the 1988 tabletop game, Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person action RPG game set in a dystopian cyber future developed by CD Projekt Red. Players will tackle the streets of Night City as customizable protagonist V, who struggles to keep their memories intact after receiving a strange cybernetic implant that slowly overrides their memories by a deceased celebrity known as Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves.
