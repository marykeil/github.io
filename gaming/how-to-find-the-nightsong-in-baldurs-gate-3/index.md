## Literature Review

Finding the Nightsong is one of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s longest quests, with deep links to companion quests and choices that can affect the final battle.





Luckily, you don’t need to do much extra prep to find the Nightsong as long as you have a strong party composition and a solid character build planned out. To start the Find the Nightsong quest, chat with Aradin, the adventurer in the Emerald Grove, after fighting the goblin raiders at the gates.

 How To Find The Nightsong In Baldur’s Gate 3 (Act 1) 
         

When speaking with Aradin, the party can ask why he was being chased. He will explain that the wizard Lorroakan hired his crew to retrieve a mysterious relic called the Nightsong.



Other ways to start this quest include speaking to the imprisoned adventurer Liam in the Shattered Sanctum of the Goblin Camp. However, most players will likely encounter Aradin first.




          

Unfortunately, the Nightsong is supposedly inside an ancient temple, now the Goblin Campsite. Dealing with the Goblin Camp is one of the main story objectives of Act One, and there are a few ways to get inside. You can persuade or deceive the goblins to let you pass, sneak inside, or even just fight and clear the camp yourself.






You can also poison the Goblin Party to even the odds.




         

Once you’ve reached the Shattered Sanctum in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, head to the door to the Priestess’ Quarters at X: 255, Y: -8. This leads to the Defiled Temple area. After defeating the ogre bodyguard Polma in Priestess Gut’s quarters, head down the stairs to the left.

          




In the next room, you will have to solve the Defiled Temple Moon Puzzle by rotating the discs on the floor. Your goal is to get all black circles on the southernmost disc. The following steps will solve the puzzle:

  Top x2   Right x1   Top x3   Left x3   Bottom x3   Left x2  

          

Solving the puzzle unlocks a passage to a hidden Selunite Outpost in the Underdark. Unfortunately, the trail of the Nightsong goes cold here, and you won’t be able to progress the quest until Act Two.

Once you reach the Shadow-Cursed Lands in Baldur’s Gate 3&#39;s Act 2, you can resume your search for the Nightsong. Initially, your party won’t be able to explore much due to the dangers of the shadow curse, so follow the main story until you earn the ability to traverse the darkness safely.




          

Once you do, head through the abandoned town of Reithwin and head northwest to find the Grand Mausoleum. It turns out that the Nightsong is the source of Ketheric Thorm’s immortality, and you can deal with it now before infiltrating Moonrise Towers.

          

The Grand Mausoleum is home to the Gauntlet of Shar. You and your party will have to solve the Gauntlet of Shar’s puzzles and complete its many trials while also dealing with the infernal presence of Raphael, the devil on your shoulder. You will also have to deal with the undead priest Balthazar and his minions.




The Gauntlet is also a big part of Shadowheart’s companion questline in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. As a devotee of Shar, she wants to become one of Shar’s Dark Justiciars, and going through the Gauntlet is the final test for aspiring Justiciars. Make sure to include her in the party, or she will leave the party forever. At the end of the Gauntlet of Shar, you will reach a point of no return where you will enter the Shadowfell. Make sure to complete Act Two’s quests and side content, including rescuing the Tieflings from Moonrise Towers, before entering the Shadowfell.



Complete everything you can, as this is a true point of no return; quests will progress with potentially important consequences for the rest of the game.




Inside the Shadowfell, you will finally uncover the Nightsong. However, the Nightsong isn’t a relic but an imprisoned aasimar named Dame Aylin. A servant of Shar’s mortal enemy, Selune, Aylin, has been imprisoned and killed dozens of times by Dark Justiciars.




          

It falls to you to decide whether to spare or kill the Nightsong. If Shadowheart is present, she will want to kill Aylin and become a Dark Justiciar. Allowing her to do so is arguably an evil choice, and it will affect any romance you have with her as she becomes totally devoted to Shar. The Last Light Inn and its inhabitants will also be overwhelmed and killed.

However, you can get Shadowheart to turn away from Shar by passing Persuasion checks. If you manage this, she will cast Shar’s Spear of Night into the depths of the Shadowfell and free Dame Aylin. Aylin will then fly off to do battle against Ketheric Thorm, triggering the final part of Act Two.



Players can speak to Aylin and her partner, the Selunite cleric Isobel, at the party camp after the final battle if freed. Aylin will offer to tell Shadowheart more about her lost memories and past.









 How To Find The Nightsong In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 (Act 3) 
         

Act Two isn’t quite the end of the Find The Nightsong quest, as you can also track down Lorroakan in Act Three and ask him why he was searching for the Nightsong. Lorroakan can be found in Ramazith’s Tower once you’ve gained access to Baldur’s Gate&#39;s Lower City. This is the same building where you will discover Sorcerous Sundries, a shop that sells the finest magical artifacts and items on the Sword Coast.



Aradin can be found arguing with a magical construct outside Sorcerous Sundries. You will have to persuade or deceive him into thinking you never found the Nightsong, or he will arrive at the party camp later and attempt to take Aylin by force.




          




The party will have to solve a small puzzle up the stairs from Sorcerous Sundries. Several different portals are available for you to travel through, but only one will take you to meet Lorroakan. The plaques next to each portal contain different statements about what the Nightsong is.



Choose the portal with a plaque stating that the Nightsong is an immortal being, the child of a deity.




          

After meeting Lorroakan, he explains that he hoped to steal the Nightsong’s immortality. You can return to the party camp and speak to Aylin about Lorroakan, prompting her to fly off to confront him. At this point, you can return to Lorroakan and help Aylin defeat him or betray her in return for the reward money.




Your choice will affect which allies can join you in the final battle:

  Assisting Lorroakan allows you to unleash Lorroakan’s Firestorm from Ramazith’s Tower during the final battle. However, you permanently lose both Aylin and Isobel as potential allies.   Assisting Aylin allows you to summon her to join you in the final battle and to use Isobel’s Balm of the Moonmaiden power to heal your party once in the final battle.  



If the Tiefling wizard Rolan survived Act One and Act Two and weren’t killed in the battle with Lorroakan, he would take over Ramazith’s Tower. Players can, therefore, side with Aylin and Isobel while still receiving the Firestorm ability from Rolan in the final battle.




          

Regardless of which ally you choose, resolving the fight completes the Find the Nightsong quest in Baldur’s Gate 3. It’s one of the game’s longest questlines, but by the end, players are rewarded with at least one powerful ally to take into the final battle for Baldur’s Gate.
