## Literature Review

The first Glyphs you get in the roguelike Valhalla expansion to God of War Ragnarok determine Kratos&#39; best abilities as you progress through battles.





Reaching a sanctuary realm in God Of War: Ragnarök Valhalla presents two doors with a random Valhalla Symbol showing you what type of skills you could choose to receive. Five doors are associated with Glyphs - the Perk, Stats, Weapon, Runic Attack, and Mixed Glyph doors. The best upgrades to get first in GoW: Ragnarok Valhalla depends on your preferences, but some are better.
Perk Glyphs are divided into Silver, Gold, and Perfect Glyphs, each providing unique combat abilities with certain moves. While most other Glyphs are straightforward, a Mixed Glyph will give you a random upgrade from the other categories.

Although God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla serves as a fun roguelike mode, it also makes significant contributions to the overall narrative of the game.












 








 10  Winter&#39;s Bite (Runic Attack Glyph) 
Cold as the Grave
        

   Glyph    Description     Winter&#39;s Bite    Form a mass of ice around the Leviathan Axe and run up to strike a target with incredible force.    
A few Runic Attack Glyphs are universally good to pick for any build, but the Winter&#39;s Bite upgrade for the Leviathan Axe is always a consistent skill to choose early. Not only does this Light Runic Attack give you extra damage on your Axe strikes, but it also applies a good amount of Frost build up. This extra status effect can be a great advantage against the early enemies and bosses in a Valhalla run.
All Runic Attack and Weapon Glyphs are tied to specific weapons that Kratos can wield, including the Leviathan Axe, Blades of Chaos, or Draupnir Spear. Since these Glyphs are related to specific builds, it is typically best to grab them later. 






 9  Blessing of Bravery (Stat Glyph) 
Fortune Favors the Bold


   Glyph    Description     Blessing of Bravery    Increases your Strength, Vitality, and Luck stats.    
While there are many new features in God of War: Ragnarök Valhalla, many of the stats for Kratos remain the same as in the base game. Reset attributes for a run make the Blessing of Bravery Glyph an excellent upgrade to find to improve your most important traits. According to YouTube creator JorRaptor, prioritizing essential stats is one of the most important things you can do early on when enemies are weaker.
This Stat Glyph improves your Strength to increase your base damage and makes your Vitality higher to give Kratos more health. The extra bonus to the Luck stat also gives you a better chance to find better upgrades in various chests or containers found scattered throughout the dangerous sections of Valhalla in the future. You may even find better Glyphs when you have a more significant Luck stat in God of War Ragnarök.

In the Valhalla DLC for God of War Ragnarok, players can activate new challenges for Kratos called Burdens that can reward him handsomely.








 8  Defender&#39;s Relief (Silver Perk Glyph) 
Resist Strong Enemy Attacks
        

   Glyph    Description     Defender&#39;s Relief    While blocking, take less damage from unblockable attacks and attacks from behind.    
Silver Perks are the lowest rarity but are often the most common type of Glyph in Valhalla. This makes the Defender&#39;s Relief Glyph an excellent choice for a starting run due to the extra defense provided by the Perk. One of the easiest ways to die comes from not having a lot of protection against early bosses in God of War Ragnarök or from a cheap attack that hits you when you aren&#39;t looking.
The threats of early enemies with strong, unavoidable attacks in Valhalla make this Glyph an excellent tool for those struggling to survive within the new roguelike systems of God of War Ragnarök&#39;s DLC.





 7  Whiplash Deflection (Weapon Glyph) 
Deny Projectiles of Any Kind


 







   Glyph    Description     Whiplash Deflection    While charging the Flame Whiplash with the Blades of Chaos, incoming Projectile attacks will be deflected.    
Whiplash Deflection is a Glyph that only works with the Blades of Chaos, an upgrade that should always be taken if you have the chance. This Weapon ability lets you send back projectiles fired at Kratos back to your enemies while you charge Flame Whiplash. This gives you a rare opportunity to defend Kratos from harm and empower one of his best weapons in God of War Ragnarök at the same time.





 6  Aggressor&#39;s Resolve (Silver Perk Glyph) 
No Sudden Interruptions
        

   Glyph    Description     Aggressor&#39;s Resolve    Kratos takes reduced damage and has increased Stagger Resistance during his basic attacks and skills.    
Enemies can be quite annoying in God of War Ragnarök during the early stages of Valhalla when they interrupt your attacks, sometimes in larger groups. The Aggressor&#39;s Resolve Glyph makes it easier to continue attacking without worrying about every foe at once. These small defensive bonuses may help you target the most dangerous foe in a larger horde and take it down quickly without distraction.





 5  Risen Might (Silver Perk Glyph) 
Juggle Your Foes Often
        

   Glyph    Description     Risen Might    Launching an Enemy has a High Luck Chance to increase Kratos&#39; Strength and Stagger Resistance for a duration.    
Anyone who has played enough God of War Ragnarök will know that launching enemies into the air is a great way to deal massive damage to Kratos&#39; foes. This Risen Might Silver Perk Glyph gives you even more incentive to do this in combat and encourages good habits of expert fighters. This upgrade also has a better chance of activating in Valhalla than other Glyphs you might equip.





 4  Blessing of Endurance (Stat Glyph) 
Recharge Runic Abilities Fast
        

   Glyph    Description     Blessing of Endurance    Increase Defense and Cooldown stats.    
As you choose different Runic Attacks, the Blessing of Endurance Glyph acts as a way to make sure the special attacks you gain can be used frequently. Raising Kratos&#39; Defense gives you more protection, but the real highlight of this upgrade is how the Cooldown stat increase compliments nearly any build. Effective and straightforward Glyphs are extremely versatile in God of War Ragnarök&#39;s Valhalla DLC.​​​​​​​





 3  Enraged Slayer (Gold Perk Glyph) 
Fuel Health Through Rage
        

   Glyph    Description     Enraged Slayer    Killing an enemy while in Spartan Rage restores some Rage and Health.    
Large groups can threaten to overwhelm you and end your run in Valhalla, but the Enraged Slayer Glyph gives you a way to recover. Kratos&#39; Spartan Rage is a nearly invincible state that has already restored some of your health. However, you can use this Glyph to turn this state from a last resort into a frequent tool that eliminates foes in God of War Ragnarök and puts you in a better place to take on new challenges.
Those who overcome many of Valhalla&#39;s challenges may find a way to change their Spartan Rage to wield the infamous Blade of Olympus weapon from previous God of War titles. 






 2  Dragon&#39;s Rebuke (Gold Perk Glyph) 
Offense and Defense in Equal Measure


   Glyph    Description     Dragon&#39;s Rebuke    Increases all Shield damage, and successful Blocks or Parries now deal Shield damage to nearby enemies.    
Using your Shield should be second nature to Parry or Block attacks from the strongest enemies in God of War Ragnarök. The Dragon&#39;s Rebuke Glyph benefits those who understand the flow of combat well enough to pull off these defensive techniques. Simple boosts to damage combined with a strong Area of Effect (AoE) burst can clear crowds that threaten to take you down.
Many players, like YouTube creator Sny_Guy, have discovered that this Glyph is only limited by their own skills and should always be included in Kratos&#39; strongest builds. Unlike other paths focusing on one weapon over another, this Perk is flexible in nearly every route you can take in Valhalla.





 1  Last Grasp (Perfect Perk Glyph) 
One More Chance
        

   Glyph    Description     Last Grasp    When Kratos&#39; Health drops to a critical level, you are given an invincible barrier for a short time, buffs to Strength, and a Health Burst when the barrier drops.    
Many Perfect Perks are excellent ways for Kratos to succeed in Valhalla, but the Last Grasp Glyph remains the strongest to pick up first. Surviving what would ordinarily be a failed run with an impenetrable barrier can turn a bad situation around entirely. The added Health Burst and Strength boost in God of War Ragnarök almost guarantees that you overcome any dangerous circumstance.
The best Glyphs to get first in God of War RagnarökValhalla may seem lackluster compared to other available skills, but the simple and effective approach allows you to balance out whatever build you have in mind for Kratos during a run.
