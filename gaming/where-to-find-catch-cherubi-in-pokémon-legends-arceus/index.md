## Literature Review

Cherubi is a rare Grass-type Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Arceus that inhabits several locations but appears at a relatively low spawn rate.





Since this Cherry Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Arceus is quite rare, you will need to head to specific locations on Hisui. Trainers who are struggling to catch Cherubi in their first few attempts may want to stick to one or two regions instead of visiting all possible spawn locations.




                  How To Catch All 242 Pokémon In Legends: Arceus (Complete Pokédex)   There are 242 Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and players will have to catch them all to fill the first-ever Pokédex of the Hisui region.

Where To Find Cherubi
          

Since Legends: Arceus has a massive open world, it&#39;s recommended Trainers limit their search for Cherubi within the Obsidian Fieldlands. You will be able to find Cherubi in two trees in this location, which increases your odds of finding one in less time. However, if you are not in the Obsidian Fieldlands, you can search for Cherubi in alternate locations that are closer to you:

 Where to find Cherubi  Specific Location on Map   The Obsidian Fieldlands  Shaking trees at the southernmost tip of the riverbank, at the bottom of the map.   The Crimson Mirelands  Shaking trees near the Solaceon Ruins and south of Gapejaw Bog.   The Coronet Highlands  Shaking trees in Bolderoll Ravine, the Primeval Grotto, and the Lonely Spring.   








 Best Cherubi Location in Legends: Arceus 
Height Camps Is A Better Place To Catch Cherubi
          

For ease of access, Trainers are advised to unlock and use the Heights Camp instead of the Fieldlands Camp when trying to find Cherubi in Arceus, as the former is much closer to the target location. Additionally, using the Braviary Mount to fly across the map will significantly reduce the time to travel between the camp and riverbank.



To unlock Hisuian Braviary, Trainers will need to do the main story mission, &#34;The Slumbering Lord of the Tundra,&#34; during which they will receive the Ride Pokémon after defeating Sabi. See how to complete that quest in the video from Gamerpillar here:

 
 






 Finding Legends: Arecus&#39; Cherubi Trees 
Identifying The Correct Trees
          




To catch a Cherubi, it&#39;s important to identify the correct tree before throwing a Poké Ball. From the camp in Obsidian Fieldlands, move towards the two trees that are blue in color. These trees should be near the Moss Rock. Once you have located the two trees, throw a Poké Ball on the tree that is shaking.

Either Cherubi or a different Pokémon will pop out. In the event of a different Pokémon spawning, head back to Jubilife Village to reset the area and essentially the RNG as well. Repeat the above process until you catch Cherubi and add the cute Pokémon to your Pokédex.



 Tips For Catching Cherubi 
Weaknesses &amp; Poké Balls

 

Once you&#39;ve located Cherubi, it should be fairly easy to catch as it&#39;s not a particularly powerful Pokémon. As a Grass-type, it&#39;s best to avoid using Fire-type Pokémon when in battle to avoid the risk of a full faint. According to RankedBoost, Cherubi&#39;s Highest IV Stat is Special Attack (62), and its Lowest is Attack (35). Because of the rariety of this &#39;mon, Pokémon Legends: Arceus players might want to use a Poké Ball with a high catch rate to guarantee success first time.
