## Literature Review

Palworld has 111 Pals available for players to find that range across nine different element types. Here are some of the coolest Pals early on.




The latest pocket monster collecting game, Palworld, has 111 Pals available to find in the game, each with their own skills and personalities. These Pals are very similar to many of the familiar characters in Pokémon games, although with quite a bit more violence added to the gun-wielding and base-building mechanics of the open-world game. Palworld Pals do not evolve, so each of the 111 characters is unique and found in the world, and each must be tamed, captured, or defeated.
Pals in Palworld have a Paldex, much like a Pokédex in Pokémon, with an associated Paldex number. The monsters use certain Element types in their attacks and defenses, and they can be dual-Element wielding as well. Unlike Pokémon, the captured Pals in Palworld also perform certain work for the player in helping build up bases and gather supplies. Later in the game, some of the larger Pals can even be ridden as mounts. Killing Pals can result in useful resources such as organs, leather, and bones.
            
 
 Is Palworld A Pokémon Rip-Off? 
A new game releasing later this year on Steam, Palworld, has some similarities to Pokémon that may make it look like a rip-off on the surface.












 








 10  Foxparks (Paldex #005) 
Flame Element Pal
        

Foxparks is known for being one of the leading causes of forest fires as they don&#39;t know how to control the fire they wield, but Palworld&#39;s survival edge means that players need to have a source of heat, which Foxparks can easily provide. Foxparks provides the Partner Ability called Huggy Fire, which sounds incredibly dangerous, but once leveled up, the Huggy Fire ability becomes Flamethrower. This Pal is able to work in Kindling, which can help with cooking and smelting.





 9  Chikipi (Paldex #003) 
Neutral Element Pal


 







Chikipi is a common Pal to come across very early in Palworld, and although they don&#39;t seem like they are anything special, they are cool mainly for their uniqueness in this game versus other similar games. Chikipi is a perfect source of food, not only from the eggs it can grant when assigned to a Ranch but also to be cooked for poultry. One of Palworld&#39;s unique features is the ability to eat Pals, with Chikipi being a prime example of this mechanic.





 8  Lamball (Paldex #001) 
Neutral Element Pal
        

Lamball is one of the first Pals that players come across in the game, and its round shape and adorable smile make it one of the cutest there are. Paldex number 001, Lamball isn&#39;t very strong in combat but can be used as a shield. It can work in Handiwork, Transporting, and Farming and produces Wool after a Ranch has been built. Killing a Lamball can result in getting Lamball Mutton.





 7  Tanzee (Paldex #008) 
Grass Element Pal
        

Tanzee&#39;s appearance alone makes it qualified to be on a list of cool Palworld Pals, with a cute and colorful look that is added to by its leaf-design hairstyle. Tanzee is made even cooler by their preference of using an AK-47 at every possibility and has the Partner Skill Cheery Rifle where Tanzee mercilessly fires his gun at all enemies in range. The little gun-happy Pal is useful at work too, with a work suitability in Planting, Handiwork, Lumbering, Transporting, and Gathering.





 6  Lifmunk (Paldex #004) 
Grass Element Pal


 







For early planting in Palworld, it often comes down to a choice between Gumoss and Lifmunk, yet Lifmunk is the cooler choice as it can do many more things as well, and looks adorably dangerous when wielding an SMG. Coolest of all, is that when equipped with its SMG, Lifmunk can station themselves on the character&#39;s head and fire at will from this impressive position. Lifmunk can also chop down trees, plant and gather from Berry Plantations, and help at workbenches. Once a Medieval Medicine Workbench is crafted, Lifmunk can make medicines.





 5  Hoocrates (Paldex #015) 
Dark Element Pal
        

Previously referred to as Smug Owl, Hoocrates is an owl-like Pal who appears to wear a wizard hat from the feathers on its head. Despite featuring a lightning bolt on their chest, Hoocrates is a Dark Element Pal who uses their Dark Knowledge Partner Skill to make all Dark Element Pals in a team have increased power. When killed, one of its possible drops is a High Grade Technical Manual which can be used to give the player one Technology Point.
Hoocrates can only be found at night.







 4  Eikthyrdeer (Paldex #014) 
Neutral Element Pal
        

Not only does Eikthyrdeer look beautiful with its purple coloration and blue-tipped antlers, but it is also one of the most powerful Pals that a player can get early in the game. It looks cool while battling with its aggressive focus and impressive antlers, taking charge of any situation quickly. Most notably, Eikthyrdeer is one of the few early-game Pals that players can use as a mount and ride, and it can do a double jump at the same time.
            
 
 Palworld Dares To Do What Pokémon Won&#39;t 
Pocketpair&#39;s PalWorld may emulate the Pokémon series&#39; basic formula, but the game will do something that Pokémon titles could not pull off themselves.








 3  Cattiva (Paldex #002) 
Neutral Element Pal
        

Palworld&#39;s Cattiva is a cool-looking cat that is hilarious in its cowardly nature. Despite giving off a vibe of being a tough Pal, it has a Passive Skill called Coward, making it not quite as useful in battle, but it is helpful to have for other reasons. Cattiva has the work suitability skills of Handiwork, Transporting, Gathering, and Mining, which makes it invaluable early on.





 2  Pengullet (Paldex #010) 
Water &amp; Frost Element Pal
        

Pengullets have an appearance that is reminiscent of if the Super Mario 64 penguins had been practicing their combat skills for the next time they run across a plumber. These little blue Pals in Palworld are useful in Transporting, Watering, and Cooling, but it is their Partner Skill that makes them truly deserving of being labeled cool. The Pengullet Cannon combat skill makes it so the player equips a Rocket Launcher and fires Pengullet as ammunition. Upon hitting its target, Pengullet explodes and is incapacitated.





 1  Daedream (Paldex #019) 
Dark Element Pal


 







Daedream is a beautifully designed Pal, with ethereal-looking hair and a floating quality that gives the Dark Elemental Pal a spooky feel to it. They are only found at night and provide a powerful combat ability with their Partner Skill. When in a team, the Dream Chaser skill can be used, so Daedream appears near the player and each time the player attacks, Daedream adds magic bullets, giving a combat boost in Palworld.
