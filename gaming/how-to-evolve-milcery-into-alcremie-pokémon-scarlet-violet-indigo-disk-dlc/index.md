## Literature Review

There are over 70 forms of Alcremire that Milcery evolves into in Scarlet and Violet with Sweets and mixing types at different times of the day.





To find Milcery in the wild in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, first make sure to purchase the downloadable content, The Indigo Disk. Unlock and fly over to the Polar Biome in the Blueberry Academy and look for a big cave in the middle of the map. Right outside the cave will be many Pokémon wandering around with a possible Milcery sighting. If you&#39;re looking to catch many Milcery at one time, it is recommended to use Quick Balls to swiftly catch Milcery in bulk.




                  How To Evolve Inkay Into Malamar (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC)   Inkay is a weird Pokemon to evolve in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, turning into a Malamar if you use an old trick from previous games.   


 Alcremie Sweets and Where to Find Them 
          

After successfully catching all of your Milcery in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you will need to collect Sweets. These items can be found all over the Terarium in the Blueberry Academy. They pop up in random sparkles on the ground or through specific hidden Pokéballs.



You will be able to get many Sweets, so don&#39;t worry about running out of them. You can also use the Item Printer, which produces random items through BP and Pokémon materials.

 Evolution Methods: Spinning 
          

The final step to evolving Milcery to Alcremie in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is knowing how to spin. This ultimately mixes the Pokémon and the Sweet together, much like a Pokémon evolution stone. Give a specific Sweet to Milcery, figure out which personalized flavor you want your Alcremie to be, and your new friend will evolve according to the Sweet and time of day.
