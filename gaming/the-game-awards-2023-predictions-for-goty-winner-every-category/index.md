## Literature Review

Each year, the winners of the various categories at The Game Awards go down in history. Here are Screen Rantâ€™s predictions for who will win in 2023.




Each year, The Game Awards is one of the biggest events in the video game industry, serving as a culmination of the year&#39;s gaming work and a way for everyone to look back and ponder what was enjoyed, or even disliked, during the past twelve months. 2023 was a big year for video games, with many impressive releases that happened regularly throughout the months. Because of this, talk about which games will be awarded has been a topic of conversation throughout all of 2023.




The Game Awards 2023 is scheduled to air on December 7, 2023, at 7:30 pm ET and will celebrate all the best that the video game industry has done over the year as well as provide many exclusive trailers and announcements about what is to come. The highlight of the event is the coveted Game of the Year award, which has six hopeful nominees for 2023. Here are all the categories of The Game Awards, with the lists of nominees and the Screen Rant predictions of who will take home each award.

 : The Game Awards 2023: Every Category &amp; Nomination


 Game Of The Year 
&#34;Recognizing A Game That Delivers The Absolute Best Experience&#34;
         

Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Predicted Winner]   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Resident Evil 4   Super Mario Bros. Wonder   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom  

The nominees in the running for TGA&#39;s Game of the Year award are impressive for 2023, making it hard to predict exactly what game will take home the honors. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a favored choice, as it is truly a masterpiece in every way. However, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could be the dark horse here, particularly since Breath of the Wild was the Game of the Year winner for 2017. Still, BG3 was released in a year full of great games and still managed to stand out, becoming a part of the zeitgeist and remaining popular even months post-launch. It was a critical and commercial success, and it deserves to win GOTY.

 Best Game Direction 
&#34;Awarded For Outstanding Creative Vision And Innovation In Game Direction And Design&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Predicted Winner]   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Super Mario Bros. Wonder   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom  

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a creative and rewarding experience that has a cohesive flow to it despite being a massive game with many choices to be made and adventures to be had. This category highlights the way that the many features and elements of a game can work together to shape the story and experience, which is perfectly crafted in this situation. The game direction and design for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are truly impressive and deserving of the award.

 Best Narrative 
&#34;For Outstanding Storytelling And Narrative Development In A Game&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty   Final Fantasy XVI [Predicted Winner]   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2  

The narrative in Final Fantasy 16 successfully carries on the tradition of Final Fantasy titles in bringing an incredible story to life. Through the cutscenes, main story, and even side quests, the narrative that is slowly revealed throughout the game is a perfect example of how to tell a story. Revealing just enough at a time to keep players intrigued while weaving a fascinating tale, Final Fantasy 16 encapsulates the directive of &#34;outstanding storytelling and narrative development in a game.&#34;



 Best Art Direction 
&#34;For Outstanding Creative And/Or Technical Achievement In Artistic Design And Animation&#34;
         




Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2   Hi-Fi Rush   Lies of P   Super Mario Bros. Wonder [Predicted Winner]   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom  

Super Mario Bros. Wonder manages to combine a nostalgic feeling of the continuous look that the gaming community knows as Mario while also bringing it into smooth, incredible graphics. The magical effects of the Wonder Flower on the world around Mario and his friends are artistically created with just enough flair to not be overwhelming and yet feel right at home in this game.



 Best Score And Music 
&#34;For Outstanding Music, Inclusive Of Score, Original Song And/Or Licensed Soundtrack&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2, Composer Petri Alanko   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Composer Borislav Slavov   Final Fantasy XVI, Composer Masayoshi Soken   Hi-Fi Rush, Audio Director Shuichi Kobori [Predicted Winner]   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Composed By Nintendo Sound Team  




Despite being up against some heavy competition with games from big developers, Hi-Fi Rush has a soundtrack that can hold its own in this category. Its original music not only fits with the game but also works to keep the energy levels high for players. A mix of original and licensed songs, it has become a soundtrack that even those who have not played the game have enjoyed listening to.

 Best Audio Design 
&#34;Recognizing The Best In-Game Audio And Sound Design&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2   Dead Space   Hi-Fi Rush   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Resident Evil 4 [Predicted Winner]  

The Resident Evil 4 remake has faced heavy criticism for being included as a nominee for Game of the Year despite being a remake of an older game, yet when it comes to Best Audio Design; it is hard to deny that this game fits the bill. The subtle audio in the game creates a spooky environment that a horror game needs, to the extent that the game would not be the same without it. The outstanding audio direction makes Resident Evil 4 a natural choice for this award.






 Best Performance 
&#34;Awarded To An Individual For Voice-Over Acting, Motion And/Or Performance Capture&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Ben Starr, Final Fantasy XVI   Cameron Monaghan, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor   Idris Elba, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty   Melanie Liburd, Alan Wake 2   Neil Newbon, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Predicted Winner]   Yuri Lowenthal, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2  

The character of Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is one of the favorite NPCs in the game for many players, mostly due to the talented acting of Neil Newbon. His performance of Astarion makes the character come to life in a way that it feels as though he truly is Astarion rather than simply acting a part.

 Innovation In Accessibility 
&#34;Recognizing Software And/Or Hardware That Is Pushing The Medium Forward&#34;
          




Nominations:

  Diablo IV   Forza Motorsport   Hi-Fi Rush   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Mortal Kombat 1   Street Fighter 6 [Predicted Winner]  

Although each of the nominees has made strides to create more accessible features, Street Fighter 6 has opened up the fighting genre for many gamers who may have complications with hand-eye coordination and control, as well as for those who may be blind or benefit from non-visual cues. Settings can be adjusted for audio cues during fights, and several unique control schemes can be set to enable special moves to be handled by different inputs than lengthy combo sequences.



 Games For Impact 
&#34;For A Thought-Provoking Game With A Pro-Social Meaning Or Message&#34;
          

Nominations:

  A Space For The Unbound   Chants Of Sennaar   Goodbye Volcano High   Tchia   Terra Nil [Predicted Winner]   Venba  

The beautiful and peaceful puzzler, Terra Nil, puts humanity itself as the antagonist. It subtly shows what can happen in the real world from the effects of climate change and the damage that mankind has done to the planet while players work to save it. It is rewarding, fun, and very good at encouraging introspection and working to change the real world through working on one player at a time.

 Best Ongoing 
&#34;Outstanding Development Of Ongoing Content That Evolves The Player Experience&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Apex Legends   Cyberpunk 2077 [Predicted Winner]   Final Fantasy XIV   Fortnite   Genshin Impact  

The descriptive text for this Best Ongoing award specifies that it looks at &#34;ongoing content that evolves the player experience over time.&#34; While games like Genshin Impact and Fortnite certainly have regular, ongoing content, none of the nominees have evolved the player experience as much as Cyberpunk 2077 has done in 2023. Not only did the Phantom Liberty expansion add new narrative content that could change the ending of the main game, but the free patch that came with it drastically changed much of the game. Quality of life updates and an overhaul of skill trees and relics significantly changed the player experience.






 Best Community Support 
&#34;Recognizing A Game For Outstanding Community Support&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Predicted Winner]   Cyberpunk 2077   Destiny 2   Final Fantasy XIV   No Man&#39;s Sky  

One of the things that made the launch of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 a success was that Larian has consistently responded to the feedback from its player base throughout the years it was in early access and following its release. Whether jumping on fixing bugs or even doing noticeable overhauls on characters, Larian has not been scared to thoughtfully approach the community response and make changes, big or small, when needed.

 Best Independent Game 
&#34;For Outstanding Creative And Technical Achievement In A Game Made Outside The Traditional Publisher System&#34;
         




Nominations:

  Cocoon   Dave The Diver   Dredge   Sea Of Stars [Predicted Winner]   Viewfinder  

Sea of Stars touched hearts in 2023 and has become a favorite game for many who tried it this year. The turn-based RPG features incredible characters and narrative, as well as graphic design and a soundtrack that could rival any major game developer. It captures a nostalgic feel of games long past while bringing something new to captivate the gaming community.

 : &#34;More Than Just An Excellent Turn-Based RPG&#34;: Sea Of Stars Review



 Best Debut Indie Game 
&#34;For The Best Debut Game Created By A New Independent Studio&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Cocoon   Dredge [Predicted Winner]   Pizza Tower   Venba   Viewfinder  

On the surface, Dredge doesn&#39;t look to be that impressive. A low-poly fishing game doesn&#39;t sound that unique. Dredge goes much deeper than that, however, with a dark and spooky twist to the game that players heavily on emotions through its story and soundtrack. It is a combination of a terrifying Lovecraft tale and a peaceful fishing sim and is an incredible debut for the indie developer Black Salt Games.






 Best Mobile Game 
&#34;For The Best Game Playable On A Mobile Device&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis   Hello Kitty Island Adventure   Honkai: Star Rail [Predicted Winner]   Monster Hunter Now   Terra Nil  

A space fantasy RPG, Honkai: Star Rail does not seem like a game that should be on mobile. Its depth, artwork, and game mechanics seem as though it should be a PC or console game, and yet it is quite at home in a mobile environment, giving a glimpse of what gaming technology can do.



 Best VR/AR 
&#34;For The Best Game Experience Playable In Virtual Or Augmented Reality&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Gran Turismo 7 [Predicted Winner]   Horizon Call Of The Mountain   Humanity   Resident Evil Village VR Mode   Synapse  




Gran Turismo has always had a focus on providing a realistic experience, which is exponentially increased when carried into a VR world. It can truly feel as though the player is driving a real sports car, giving the perfect sense of virtual reality. Every detail is considered, even with dirt and water splashing on the windshield. The only thing that is missing is the smell of the leather interior.



 Best Action Game 
&#34;For The Best Game In The Action Genre Focused Primarily On Combat&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon [Predicted Winner]   Dead Island 2   Ghostrunner 2   Hi-Fi Rush   Remnant 2  

Looking at an action genre focused primarily on combat, it doesn&#39;t get much better than giant robots with giant guns and lasers. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon uses mech-based combat in a way that just feels like pure fun whether focusing on ranged or melee combat.




 : One Enemy Proves Armored Core 6 Really Is A Souls Game



 Best Action/Adventure 
&#34;For The Best Action/Adventure Game&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Alan Wake 2   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Resident Evil 4   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom [Predicted Winner]  

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an absolute treasure that not only combines combat with traversal and puzzle solving, as the award category suggests but also encourages player creativity by crafting nearly anything imaginable. The freedom of fusing items together, building strange vehicles, and traveling the open world can easily distract one from the goal of saving Hyrule and the Princess, but it is worth it.



 Best RPG 
&#34;For The Best Game Designed With Rich Player Character Customization And Progression&#34;
          




Nominations:

  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Predicted Winner]   Final Fantasy XVI    Lies of P   Sea of Stars   Starfield  

Baldur&#39;s Gate is the epitome of an RPG, being based on the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG world and format. The game allows players to explore with friends or NPCs and lose themselves in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms. Whether or not Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 takes home the Game of the Year award, it absolutely deserves to be given the title of Best RPG.



 Best Fighting 
&#34;For The Best Game Designed Primarily Around Head-To-Head Combat&#34;
          

Nominations:

  God Of Rock   Mortal Kombat 1   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2   Pocket Bravery   Street Fighter 6 [Predicted Winner]  

Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat are traditional franchises that have helped define the fighting game genre. The latest entry for Street Fighter 6 pulls ahead of its competition with its innovative changes to its combat and drive meter that compliment the game&#39;s strategic gameplay.






 Best Family 
&#34;For The Best Game Appropriate For Family Play, Irrespective Of Genre Or Platform&#34;
         

Nominations:

  Disney Illusion Island   Party Animals   Pikmin 4   Sonic Superstars   Super Mario Bros. Wonder [Predicted Winner]  

Many good family games were released in 2023, but it is hard for anything to beat an incredible Super Mario game. Super Mario Bros. Wonder brought the series back to its 2D platformer roots while also introducing and featuring many new game mechanics, like the Wonder Flower and Elephant suit, to provide even more puzzles and humor to the game.



 Best Sim/Strategy 
&#34;Best Game Focused On Real Time Or Turn-Based Simulation Or Strategy Gameplay&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Advance Wars 1&#43;2: Re-Boot Camp   Cities: Skylines II   Company Of Heroes 3   Fire Emblem Engage   Pikmin 4 [Predicted Winner]  




Pikmin 4 shines in its real-time strategy roots with the addition of the adorable Pikmin helpers and Oatchi. The level of micromanagement that players need to employ is not apparent at first but requires some true thought to solve some of the puzzles in the game.



 Best Sports/Racing 
&#34;For The Best Traditional And Non-Traditional Sports And Racing Game&#34;
          

Nominations:

  EA Sports FC 24   F1 23   Forza Motorsport [Predicted Winner]   Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged   The Crew Motorfest  

Forza Motorsport offers realistic graphics and environments with an impressive multiplayer mode to enjoy. As the newest in the line of Forza games, it has even more developed physics with a driving experience that is addictive. It also includes many customizations and ways to personalize the gameplay of the driving experience. However, this game is up against some steep competition, with F1 23 and The Crew Motorfest pulling up close behind it for their gameplay and beauty.






 Best Multiplayer 
&#34;For Outstanding Online Multiplayer Gameplay And Design&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Predicted Winner]   Diablo 4   Party Animals   Street Fighter 6   Super Mario Bros. Wonder  

Multiplayer games will always be a bit subjective based on those who are playing the game. Overall, for being an outstanding experience to share with friends, loved ones, or even strangers, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is once again at the top of the list for its ingenuity and creative gameplay. Having a party with another person can be a rewarding experience that is as close to Dungeons &amp; Dragons as one can get in a video game adventure.



 Best Adaptation 
&#34;Recognizing Outstanding Creative Work That Faithfully And Authentically Adapts A Video Game&#34;
          




Nominations:

  Castlevania: Nocturne   Gran Turismo   The Last Of Us [Predicted Winner]   The Super Mario Bros. Movie   Twisted Metal  

Although The Super Mario Bros. Movie and others that have been nominated here are fun adaptations that bring in many elements of their respective games, The Last Of Us went a step further. Following the directive that it &#34;faithfully and authentically adapts a video game,&#34; The Last Of Us was a stunning example of how well a video game can be recreated, with powerful actors and writing that was consistent with the game.



 Most Anticipated Game 
&#34;Recognizing An Announced Game That Has Demonstrably Illustrated Potential To Push The Gaming Medium Forward&#34;
          

Nominations:

  Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [Predicted Winner]   Hades II   Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth   Star Wars Outlaws   Tekken 8  

Final Fantasy games are always going to receive a lot of attention and anticipation. With the expanded trilogy remake of Final Fantasy VII, the hype is even greater for those who played the original or the first portion of Final Fantasy VII Remake that debuted in 2020. The story of the RPG has evolved and changed just enough to keep everyone guessing and anxiously awaiting the release of Rebirth on February 29, 2024.

While each of the nominees for Content Creator of the Year has a large fanbase and puts out engaging content, Chris Bratt from People Make Games takes his streams a step further.

Even for those who do not regularly follow esports, League of Legends is one of the first games to come to mind when the competitive sport is brought up.

The French professional esports player Mathieu &#34;ZywOo&#34; Herbaut is one of the players on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&#39;s Team Vitality.

Christine &#34;Potter&#34; Chi is a retired professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive broadcast analyst who uses her knowledge of gaming to coach the Evil Geniuses Valorant team. Her ability to strategize and cheerfully boost the team has helped lead them to many victories this year. Interestingly, another nominee, Team Vitality&#39;s Remy &#34;XTQZZZ&#34; Quoniam has requested to be removed from the nominations, stating that he &#34;wasn&#39;t even a coach this year&#34; in a statement on X (formerly Twitter).
