## Literature Review

Building Furina can be tough, especially because she can play three different roles in a party. Here are her best builds and teams in Genshin Impact.





The official reveal of the character confirms all the previous Furina kit leaks in Genshin Impact, showing that she is, in fact, an off-field damage dealer and a healer. As such, Furina essentially has two distinct builds that you can choose from – three if you disregard her as a complete healer and lean into her ATK-buffing build. Luckily, all her abilities, offensive or restorative, scale on a single stat, making the process of building her much more simple and streamlined. Before starting, however, you need to choose if you want Furina to deal damage, heal, or provide buffs for the team.




                  Genshin Impact - Furina Character Ascension (&amp; Materials)   Ascending Furina is the best way of unlocking her full potential. Here is what you will need to max out the Hydro Archon’s level in Genshin Impact.    


 Furina’s Builds, Explained 
          

As a sub-DPS, Furina will jump in to activate her Elemental Skill and quickly be swapped out. This will allow the main DPS to deal damage while her Ousia-aligned elemental projections deal Hydro DMG – at the cost of the party’s HP. Furina also provides off-field Hydro application this way, facilitating Elemental Reactions in Genshin Impact.

As a healer, Furina will be aligned with Pneuma, and her build is focused on boosting her HP stat to provide more restoration. As a buffer, she is aligned to Ousia and has a unique build, relying on her Burst to trigger the ATK bonus for the team.






Furina&#39;s best builds and ideal team comps may vary slightly following her release.






 Best Weapons For Furina (Focalors) 
          

Because of how different her builds are, there are various weapons that Furina can wield, each of which serves a purpose. One of the best weapons in Genshin Impact is her signature 5-star sword, Splendor of Tranquil Waters. This weapon has a staggering 88.2% CRIT DMG sub-stat boost (at level 90) and is even better with its skill. When the user’s HP fluctuates, their Skill DMG increases by 8% for six seconds, up to three stacks, an effect that can occur every 0.2 seconds. When party members’ HP fluctuates, the user’s HP will increase by 14% for six seconds, up to two stacks that can be triggered every 0.2 seconds.




Splendor of Tranquil Waters works as the best sword for Furina’s sub-DPS or buffer builds, according to Game8. It also fits her healer build, though there is a better weapon for that role, Key of Khaj-Nisut. Nilou’s signature 5-star sword has a 66.2% HP sub-stat boost (at level 90), plus an extra 20% HP via the weapon’s skill. Although it does have a boost to Elemental Mastery, the stacked HP boosts are enough to justify its usage in Furina’s healer build in Genshin Impact.

The table below lists the best weapons, Artifacts, and stats for each of Furina’s builds:

 Furina&#39;s Best Build In Genshin Impact   Weapon  Sub-DPS:  Splendor of Tranquil Waters (Best 5-star)   Key of Khaj-Nisut (Substitute 5-star)   Finale of the Deep (Best 4-star)   Wolf-Fang (Substitute 4-star)   Fleuve Cendre Ferryman (F2P 4-star)    Healer:  Key of Khaj-Nisut (Best 5-star)   Splendor of Tranquil Waters (Substitute 5-star)   The Dockhand&#39;s Assistant (Best 4-star)   Fleuve Cendre Ferryman (F2P 4-star)    DMG Buffer:  Splendor of Tranquil Waters (Best 5-star)   Key of Khaj-Nisut (Substitute 5-star)   Favonius Sword (Best 4-star)   Fleuve Cendre Ferryman (F2P 4-star)      Artifact  Sub-DPS:  Golden Troupe (4-pieces)    Healer:  Ocean-Hued Clam (4-pieces)    DMG Buffer:  Tenacity of Millelith (4-pieces)      Stat Priority  Sub-DPS:  HP   CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate   Hydro DMG   Elemental Mastery    Healer:  HP   Healing Bonus    DMG Buffer Support:  HP   Energy Recharge      Skill Priority  Sub-DPS and Healer:  Elemental Skill   Elemental Burst   Normal Attack    DMG Buffer:  Elemental Burst   Elemental Skill   Normal Attack      



Of course, you can equip substitutes in case you do not have access to the best weapons for Furina. You just need to find options that match the playstyle and best stats for each of her builds. If she is used as a sub-DPS, then the best option is to lean into weapons that can boost HP and offensive stats, such as CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG. If you are using Furina as a healer in Genshin Impact, then you can go fully into HP, while a support buffer can benefit from a blend of HP and Energy Recharge boosts.






 Best Team Comps For Furina (Focalors) 
         

When it comes to team building with Furina, it will largely depend on how she is being utilized. You can mix and match characters according to your own will and character availability, so long as you consider a traditional team comp in Genshin Impact with a main DPS, a sub-DPS, a healer, and a support of some kind. As a sub-DPS, Furina can be well-utilized in Vaporize and Burgeon teams, for instance, because her off-field Hydro application lasts for a significant time. As a fully dedicated healer, you can build the team around her as you please, so a solid Freeze team could work.

If Furina is being used as a DMG buffer, you can insert her into an Anemo team with Xiao or Wanderer at the forefront, for instance. Other team comps that see Hydro as a part of the Elemental Reactions, such as Hyperbloom, can also benefit from having Furina as the support. The table below lists a few team comp examples for Furina. Keep in mind, however, that they are highly customizable.




 Furina&#39;s Best Team Comps In Genshin Impact   Sub-DPS Furina (Vaporize or Burgeon team)    Furina (Sub-DPS)   Hu Tao or Lyney (Pyro Main DPS)   Kokomi (Healer &amp; Hydro Resonance)   Kazuha or Sucrose (Anemo Support &#43; Swirl Trigger), Nahida or Collei (Dendro Support), or Zhongli (Shields)      Healer Furina (Freeze team)    Furina (Healer)   Wriothesley or Ganyu (Cryo Main DPS)   Kokomi (Healer &amp; Hydro Resonance)   Kazuha or Sucrose (Anemo Support &#43; Swirl Trigger), or Zhongli (Shields)      DMG Buffer Support Furina (Anemo team)    Wanderer or Xiao (Anemo Main DPS)   Furina (ATK Buffer)   Faruzan (Anemo Support)   Kokomi or Bennett (Healer)      



The best team comps for Furina will always revolve around how she is built and what other Genshin Impact characters you have available to match with her. You can, for instance, build a Hyperbloom team with Furina as a sub-DPS, whereas it is also possible to create a Vaporize team with her as a healer.



If Furina is utilized as a sub-DPS, you will need to invest in a very strong healer, as her HP consumption can be menacing.






 Best Artifacts, Stats, &amp; Skill Priority For Furina (Focalors) 
          




There are different sets of Artifacts and even stat priorities for Furina depending on which role she is embracing in Genshin Impact. If she is used as a sub-DPS, the best Artifact set is Golden Troupe. These equipments will increase the DMG of her Elemental Skill creations by a total of 45% when there are four pieces. When she is not on the field, the DMG is increased by an extra 25%, making it a perfect match for her off-field sub-DPS status.

If your goal is to transform Furina into a fully dedicated healer, then it is best if you give her all four pieces of the Ocean-Hued Clam Artifact set. With two pieces, she will see a 15% bonus to her healing, and, with four pieces, she will start dealing damage while healing. In fact, this is the set that made healers in Genshin Impact viable again. If you are making Furina a DMG-buffer support character, then the best option is Tenacity of the Millelith, as it will boost her HP and when her Elemental Skill hits opponents, it will provide a 20% ATK boost for the party.




The Talent you will want to prioritize when building Furina as a sub-DPS or healer is her Elemental Skill. This is the ability that deals damage and heals, so it should be of the utmost priority for either build. Following that comes her Elemental Burst and, lastly, her Normal Attack. If she is a DMG buffer support, then Elemental Burst is more important than her Skill, but Normal Attack remains at the lowest point of priority.

Regarding stats, you will always want to invest in HP, as that is the main source of her healing, damage, and even her buff. This should be the priority, as it is shared across all three of Furina’s builds. For her sub-DPS build, you will then want to give her a decent CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG distribution and boost her Hydro DMG. For a healer build, you should increase her Healing Bonus. If she is used to boost allies, Energy Recharge should be the next most important stat.

Building Furina can be complicated if you do not what to do with her, but once you decide, it is quite easy. With the proper build and team comp, she can become one of the strongest Genshin Impact characters, regardless of which role she plays in a party.
