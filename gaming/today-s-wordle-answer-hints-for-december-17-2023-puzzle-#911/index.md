Sunday Wordle is up and ready to solve. Here are your daily hints, and fully spoiled answer, to the December 17th Wordle.





There are many different tips and tricks to help solve Wordle puzzles. One of the more popular methods is to use two starting words which is a great way to cover all the vowels in one go. Word combos like IRATE and POUND hit a lot of the most common consonants and all of the major vowels. Using this every day does waste a guess, but can help solve the puzzle quicker in the long run.

The December 17th Wordle answer is BACON.

For our starting Wordle word we tried IRATE which only provided a single misplaced &#39;A&#39; and a chunk of incorrect letters. Moving them around a bit our second attempt was PACKS. This locked in the &#39;A&#39; and added a new correct &#39;C&#39;. 

Bouncing off of those hints we tried NACHO as the third guess, this gave us the &#39;N&#39; and &#39;O&#39; in the wrong positions and set us up for a decent win. Our last guess gave us the Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer, and best food, BACON.
