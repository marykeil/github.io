## Literature Review

There are a surprising amount of unique musical instruments obtainable in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and many are nods to D&amp;D and past Larian titles. 




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is filled to the brim with witty references to its source material, Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This fact shines through perhaps no better than with the game&#39;s list of unique instruments. Though many may not ever come to experiment with the lutes or flutes one can pick up along their journey, they are a fun little activity that bards can do whenever there&#39;s a little downtime.
In BG3, there are various unique instruments one can get outside of the game&#39;s common lute, flute, hand drum, lyre, and violin, and many of them tie into the greater world of the Forgotten Realms or previous Larian Studios&#39; titles. Many of these rare items will be available toward the end of the game, in Act 3, while others can be obtained from specific characters throughout the game.
            
 
 All Adamantine Forge Items in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Ranked Worst To Best 
Six different items can be crafted at the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and it&#39;s important to make the most of this exclusive opportunity.












 








 8  Stolyarof&#39;s Table Lute (Rare) 
Obtained By Purchase At The Chromatic Scale In Lower City
        

This strange Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Easter egg of a lute is no different than the common ones found throughout Faerûn, other than the fact that it&#39;s a &#34;table&#34; lute because it&#39;s too heavy to hold and play. Though it&#39;s entirely clear about the reference to Ahndri Stolyarof (a quick search does come up with a composer) — one can assume that this is some sort of inside joke between Larian and whoever Ahndri is. This instrument can be found at the Chromatic Scale vendor above The Glitter Gala (jewelry store) in the Lower City of Baldur&#39;s Gate in Act 3 of the game, like many other unique instruments in BG3.

Entering the Lower City in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can be difficult but players have several options for entering that involve direct permission or sneaking.








 7  Kiam Goda&#39;s Kilat Drum (Rare) 
Obtained By Purchase At The Chromatic Scale In Lower City
        

Like many of the other unique musical instruments in BG3, Kiam Goda&#39;s Kilat Drum is a direct reference to the Ulutiun people in the far polar region of Faerûn. Covered in sealskin, the drum was used in koatulit peace festivals, and though not much is known about Kiam Goda himself, it ties nicely into the lore and environment of the game&#39;s inspirations. Kiam Goda&#39;s Kilat Drum can be purchased from Thomas C. Quirkilious, along with many of the game&#39;s other unique instruments at the Chromatic Scale in Lower City.
Tip: Bards get a discount on buying and selling if they talk to Thomas and select the special Bard dialogue option. 






 6  Dostrealt&#39;s Piccolo (Rare) 
Obtained By Purchase At The Chromatic Scale In Lower City
        

This rare piccolo is obtained from the one-and-only Chromatic Scale in Baldur&#39;s Gate and belongs to Captain Dostrealt of spelljammer flitter &#39;Erevan&#39;s Clutch.&#39; Though it might sound like made-up nonsense, this is actually a reference to the source material for the game.
            
 
 10 Subclasses We&#39;re Missing In BG3 From D&amp;D 5e 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 contains a core lineup of subclasses from Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, but there are plenty of other great options that haven&#39;t made it in.



Spelljammer is a reference to D&amp;D Spelljammer: Adventures in Space, which delves into the weirdness of the Astral Plane, while flitters in the D&amp;D lore are small spelljamming vessels large enough for one occupant. Dostrealt is a drow wizard, and his flitter, or ship, is named Erevan&#39;s Clutch. So, even though no one probably ever asked, the origins of this flute have deep ties to D&amp;D lore.





 5  Glimmergad&#39;s Selgaunt Fiddle (Rare) 
Obtained By Purchase At The Chromatic Scale In Lower City
        

From the description, Glimmergad&#39;s Selgaunt Fiddle is said to have been owned by a gnomish bard named Fiddlesticks Glimmergad. Apparently, their skills with the fiddle were so exceptional they could make guards weep at the sound of their sad tunes. Though his name is similar to Garl Glittergold, or The Watchful Protector (the lawful diety of the gnomes in D&amp;D), it would seem that Glimmergad&#39;s Selgaunt Fiddle is merely an instrument crafted for a bard in Selgaunt, a port on the Sea of Fallen Stars in D&amp;D.





 4  Fatataeric Cli Lyre (Rare) 
Obtained By Purchase At The Chromatic Scale In Lower City
        

The Fatateric Cli Lyre is yet another reference to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s source material and references the College of Cli, a traditional bardic college in D&amp;D. A part of the Instruments of the Bards — a collection of masterfully constructed musical equipment, the object has magical properties in the hands of a skilled bard. So powerful, in fact, that the instrument actually causes injury to any non-bard that attempts to strum its strings.
Fatateric is a reference to the instrument&#39;s creator, Falataer, a legendary bard in the history of Faerûn and an establishing founder of the College of Cli. 






 3  Lute of the Merryweather Bard (Common) 
Obtained With The Purchase Of the Digital Deluxe DLC


 







Lute of the Merryweather Bard, while merely a common item in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, is actually an enchanted musical item inspired by Lohse of Divinity: Original Sin 2. In that game, Lohse is a sassy bard with a quick wit and sharp tongue that also has a lot more under the surface — similar to many of the morally ambiguous characters in BG3. This is just one of the many callbacks to previous Larian titles, and in this case, fits perfectly with the theme of both games.
            
 
 Every Playable D&amp;D Race In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3

 2  Lihala&#39;s Lute (Story) 
Obtained From Alfira


 







One of the most memorable moments in Chapter 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is Alfira&#39;s song at camp upon defeating the goblin threat. Other than in cases of a Durge playthough, Alfira will mesmerize the party members with her beautiful voice and memorable lute. To the surprise of some, this lute can actually be looted from the dead body of Alfira. Luckily, it&#39;s not the only way, as there is actually a dialogue option before the attack on the Emerald Grove, where she will impart the lute on the adventurer with successful Charisma checks.
            
 
 How To Save Alfira In Baldur’s Gate 3 
Alfira&#39;s destiny looks bleak if you play as a certain Origin character, but there is a harsh way to save her from her gruesome fate in Act 1.








 1  Spider&#39;s Lyre (Story Item) 
Obtained From Minthara


 







Minthara&#39;s Lyre can be scooped up after defeating her at the goblin camp in Act 1 of BG3 or upon romancing Minthara, depending on the chosen route. The Lyre is required eventually to summon Kar&#39;niss, perhaps the strangest (but coolest) looking character in all of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and the self-proclaimed best buddy of Minthara. It&#39;s a shame that his backstory isn&#39;t explored a bit more in the game.
