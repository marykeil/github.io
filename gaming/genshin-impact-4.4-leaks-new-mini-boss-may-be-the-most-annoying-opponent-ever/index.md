## Literature Review

A new leak about Genshin Impact 4.4 has been revealed, hinting at what may become the hardest and most annoying mini-boss in the entire game.




A new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak is hinting at what may end up being the most annoying opponent in the game. As the game pushes further into Version 4.3, the amount of leaks about the next update is increasing, revealing a lot of the planned content that should be added when the patch arrives. This includes playable characters, area expansions, limited-time events and rewards, and even quality-of-life adjustments. One of the most notable ones is that about Xianyun’s leaked kit in Genshin Impact 4.4, for instance, which details the new character’s abilities, from her active skills to her Constellation levels.




While new playable characters tend to occupy the majority of the spotlight, other playable content is equally important. A rather big leak has mentioned the introduction of two new areas in Genshin Impact’s Liyue region, which will allegedly connect the northern portion of Bishui Plain to the eastern area of Fontaine, near Lumidouce Harbor. In addition to that, according to some new Version 4.4 leaks, it is in one of these new rumored areas that players will end up meeting a new mini-boss that has the potential to be the most annoying opponent in the entire game.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream - Date, Time, &amp; What To Expect   The special livestream program for Genshin Impact&#39;s Version 4.4 should be occurring soon, as the game progresses further into Version 4.3.   


 Genshin Impact 4.4 May Add A Duo Of Geovishaps Mini-Boss 
          




According to new information by the leaker known as Fy Leaks, shared by a user on Reddit, Version 4.4 will introduce a new mini-boss encounter. This battle will see the Traveler face two Geovishaps simultaneously. As seen in the leak, the Geovishaps are both Rulers of Chizhang Mountains, with one being called Yiji and the other being named Yianyun. One of them will control Pyro in battle, while the other uses Cryo abilities. The Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks indicate that the Geovishap duo will be located in an area east of the rumored Chizhang Wall and west of Yaodie Valley.



For reference, Geovishaps are the grounded dragon-like creatures that are found throughout Teyvat, but mostly in the Liyue region and its subsections. These are not to be confused with the Primo Geovishap, a world boss encountered in a cave in Liyue.






 Rumored Geovishaps Mini-Boss In Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks Are Local Legends 
         




A very important detail featured in the leak is that this new Geovishap duo mini-boss will be considered a Local Legend encounter. Initially introduced with the release of Fontaine back in 2023, Local Legends are extremely tough boss fights that can be found in specific spots in the open world. These special opponents have their names typed down and, according to the leak shared on Reddit, this will be the case with the rumored Geovishap duo in Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks. They will allegedly be considered a single encounter, like the Coral Defenders in Enkanomiya, in Inazuma.

Another important trait among Local Legend encounters is that the opponents featured in such fights often have a huge HP bar. This was the most notable aspect of Vivianne of the Lake in Genshin Impact, for instance. This Local Legend was an enhanced version of a regular Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm but one with a lot of strength and an immense amount of life. When it comes to gameplay mechanics, it is not particularly hard to take Vivianne of the Lake down, but they hit extremely hard, and it takes a while to fully deplete its HP bar.




If this is the case with the rumored Geovishap duo Local Legend, they may be one of the toughest encounters in the game. Geovishaps can already be somewhat difficult to eliminate depending on the player’s team comp, and when they operate as a herd, this can get a lot harder, as they can use their powers to trigger Elemental Reactions against the player. With two overpowered Geovishaps on the field, the creatures featured in the Genshin Impact 4.4 leak on Reddit may pose a threat to players with their strength and be a nuisance with their large HP bars.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Trials Are Finally Getting A Lot Better   Leaks indicate a small update to character trials in Genshin Impact 4.4, which may end up being a game-changing decision for players in the future.   



 Geovishap Duos Have A Reviving Mechanic In Genshin Impact 
          




What may make this rumored Geovishap duo even more threatening, however, is a special gameplay mechanic that sees them revive one another. According to the leak, players will need to eliminate both Geovishaps within a short time frame to avoid this. If one of the Geovishaps’ HP bars is depleted, but the other one is not eliminated in time, they will revive the downed one, bringing them back into the battle with a portion of their HP restored. As such, it seems like players will have to carefully plan how they deal damage in Genshin Impact.



This mechanic is not exactly new. Players who have gone through the Spiral Abyss or the Call of Ice and Thunder event, for instance, may have already had a preview of the Vishap revival skill with the special version of the Coral Defenders.




This mechanic is quite problematic, as eliminating a single Geovishap may not shorten the battle, but increase its duration. As is the case with the Coral Defenders’ revival mechanics, there may even be accidental eliminations of a Geovishap mini-boss with off-field abilities, which will be a nuisance depending on how much HP the remaining creature has left. If draining it all in a short period is not a possibility, then players may be subjected to facing the Geovishap duo in Genshin Impact 4.4 once again, even if at a portion of their full HP.




Additionally, Geovishaps are known for being tough creatures to beat. The various forms of Vishaps have several ways of dealing damage. The creatures are capable of quickly melting through players’ shields and eating up their HP. If this rumored Local Legend form of duo Geovishaps lives up to its alleged categorization, then they will probably hit very hard. Even if their power is divided among themselves to balance the game more appropriately, they should hit harder than regular mini-boss Vishaps in Genshin Impact, posing a huge threat to players who do not have a decent shielder and a powerful healer.

                  Genshin Impact Leaks: Weapons Update May Significantly Change The Game   A new leak suggests that an update will offer players better options when trying to acquire 5-star weapons for their characters in Genshin Impact.   

When combining the prospect of two immense HP bars, outstanding offensive firepower, and a punitive revival mechanic that fits into the huge amount of life each of these opponents may have, the rumored Local Legend Geovishap herd may end up becoming one of the most annoying opponents in the game. As is the case with any leak, however, the information about the Geovishap mini-bosses should be taken with a grain of salt until an official confirmation by HoYoverse, the developer of Genshin Impact.
