## Literature Review

As Sargon reaches new areas in the Upper City in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, you may come across a difficult Chakram puzzle you must solve.





The only way to reach this puzzle in the first place is to get Menolias&#39; Bow by defeating the boar boss that lurks in the Hyrcanian Forest area. Once you beat Jahandar in Prince of Persia: TLC, you&#39;ll be able to pursue the kidnapped Prince Ghassan into the Upper City. Doing this unlocks the Simurgh Dash ability, which lets Sargon dash once in the air whenever you press the R2 button on your controller.

 Upper City Chakram Puzzle Solution in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown 
          

The first step to solve the Upper City Chakram Puzzle is to throw the Chakram into the ring between both lion statues. This will cause the mechanism to spin, and shift both stone lions away from each other closer to the walls of the room in Prince of Persia: TLC. Go to the left wall, then jump off the wall and use Sargon&#39;s Simurgh Dash to reach the hanging pole with the blue ribbon protruding from the lion statue.

Recall your Chakram using the same button used to fire arrows from Menolias&#39; Bow in Prince of Persia: TLC. The next step here will be to drop from the platform, and use your Dash to reach the same pole you swung off of before. The lion statues should be near each other again in a place where you can swing off the pole to the platform above the statue on the right.




You&#39;ll want to use your Chakram on the central ring again to separate the statues once more, but make sure to wait until they are fully apart before doing anything. Drop from the platform, and Dash onto the pole attached to the statue on the right this time. Jump onto the platform above you, then make your way up and to the left before reaching a lever you need to activate in order to continue in Prince of Persia: TLC.

                  Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - How To Unlock Fast Travel   The massive map of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be difficult to navigate without fast travel, which you unlock by breaking rifts in time.   

Activating the lever drops a steel platform above the central part of the room, which sets up the next step. Keep your Chakram active, and climb up to the left platform like you did earlier in Prince of Persia: TLC. Jumping up to the space above, you will reveal another Chakram ring that you can activate to lower another platform by recalling your projectile and throwing it at this new target instead.






Be careful not to recall your Chakram at the wrong time, as it can be easy to have the projectile return and accidentally reset the puzzle as you try to solve it.




Go down to the platform, then drop into the air and use Dash to once again reach the pole of the left lion statue that should now be back at the center of the room. This time, you can jump onto the lowered platform and activate the lever again to move up. Simply step onto the platform lowered by your active Chakram, then recall the weapon to bring you up into the area above the main room.

Doing this will let you activate a grate that can be used to skip the puzzle in the future as you activate one last Chakram ring to reach the next room above in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.
