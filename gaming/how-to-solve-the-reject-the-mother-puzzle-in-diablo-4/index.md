## Literature Review

The Reject the Mother puzzle in Act 3 is one of many riddles in Diablo 4 that asks you to solve the hidden meaning behind a note&#39;s confusing clue.





You can start the &#34;Reject the Mother&#34; quest by picking up a Torn Note guarded by enemies in the Dry Steppes area of Diablo 4. Head to a location named Tusmaa Rift to discover a series of cliffs, with the Note resting at the top of the landscape. Reading the Note marks another spot on your map, directing you to a small blue circle where a secret shrine of Lilith may be seen near the Dark Ravine dungeon.






The Torn Note reads &#34;Shout your rejection, &#39;no Mother of mine&#39; at her towering statue in rift&#39;s hidden shrine.&#34; This is your only clue to the &#34;Reject the Mother&#34; puzzle, so study it carefully.




                  Diablo 4 Season 3 Is Bringing Back One Of Diablo 3’s Best Features   Diablo 4’s next season will include even more fun additions to the game, including a play mechanic feature that was very successful in Diablo 3.   


 Reject the Mother Puzzle Solution 
          

Once you reach Lilith&#39;s secret shrine, you have to perform the &#34;No&#34; emote in front of the statue to solve the &#34;Reject the Mother&#34; puzzle. Similar to the &#34;Pilgrim&#39;s Footsteps&#34; puzzle in Diablo 4, you need to equip the right emote for your character. Press the &#34;E&#34; key or the D-Pad Up button to access your emote menu, which has a wheel of options you can customize at will.






The easiest way to assign &#34;No&#34; as an emote is to open your emote wheel, then select the &#34;Customize&#34; prompt right below it to bring up all the different expressions available to your character.




Making such a public rejection of Lilith will cause a Heretic&#39;s Cache to appear on your right of the shrine. Interacting with this container will give you a bunch of different loot, which is randomized depending on your character&#39;s Level and what World Tier you&#39;re playing on. This also completes the quest, rewarding you with a good amount of XP and Renown for the Dry Steppes region in Diablo 4.

Figuring out how to solve the &#34;Reject the Mother&#34; puzzle in Diablo IV is a great way for characters to earn easy XP, letting them obtain greater power without the effort of slaying an army&#39;s worth of demons.
