## Literature Review

Melania is one the best DPS characters in Reverse: 1999 and can deal immense damage to a single target. Teammates should support her strength.





Melania specializes in burst damage and can ramp up with each subsequent use of her Ultimate, Ridiculous Eyewitness Testimony. When upgraded to Insight I, she gains one stack of Fixed Plan, increasing to two stacks at Insight III. Melania can hold a total of six stacks of Fixed Plan, with each granting an increase of 12% to her Ultimate power. Her skills greatly help with Moxie gain and self-sustainability. Melainia&#39;s first skill, Silent Takedown, steals one Moxie from a target at level two. While under the effect of Thief Master, her second skill, Clockwork Rats, grants her &#43;1 Moxie, this is a special state after using Ridiculous Eyewitness Testimony. Thief Master disappears after one use of the buff.





 The Best Psychubes For Melania 
          

The best psychube in Reverse: 1999 for each character is typically interchangeable, but there is one that stands out for Melania. Her best psychube is Luxurious Leisure, which can be earned from the Souvenir Shop during the event. This piece of equipment grants an 18% increase in damage at level 60 after casting a single-target Ultimate. This effect can stack up to 5 times for a total of 90% increased damage. When combined with her Fixed Plan stacks, Melania can eliminate most enemies with a single use of Ridiculous Eyewitness Testimony.

Those who miss out on obtaining Luxurious Leisure can instead use the Brave New World psychube. Brave New World provides Melania with an 18% increase in Ultimate Might while also enhancing the Incantation Might of any attack she performs following her Ultimate by 20%. This works well with the Thief Master stack she gains after casting Ridiculous Eyewitness Testimony. Players will need to purchase Brave New World from the Psychube Shop for 210 Thoughts in Entirety.






The 5-star psychube Tomorrow Also is a great alternative for Melania. At level 60, this will grant a 20% increase in critical damage, while also giving 20% critical rate to her Ultimate at Amplification level 5. Much more investment is needed to make great use of this psychube, Tomorrow Also can be purchased from the Psychube Shop for 200 Thought Element.




The Footloose is another psychube that can be used by Melania. This increases damage dealt to targets when the caster&#39;s HP is above 50%. At level 60 this bonus is 15% and an increase to Ultimate Might by 16% at max Amplification level. One copy of The Footloose is gained from completing Act 3 of the Beginning of the Tale missions. More can be further purchased from the Psychube Store for 200 Thought Element.



 The Best Team Comps For Melania 
         

Melania is a superb DPS Arcanist and should be paired with teammates who enhance her abilities. This makes A Knight a fantastic partner for this thief. He specializes in gaining Moxie quickly to cast his Ultimate and empower his allies with a 50% damage boost on their next attack. A Knight also has the rare Spirit Afflatus, which is only weak to the Intelligence enemies, while also being strong to this type.




Medicine Pocket is also a great teammate for Melainia for their great support. This unit can both heal allies and debuff enemies, allowing 20% extra damage to be dealt to a single target. Medicine Pocket is one of the best healers in the game and will support Melania through tough fights. Unfortunately, this character is a 6-star unit. which can be difficult to obtain.

Dikke is a hybrid healer and DPS unit in Reverse: 1999. Fortunately, all players get her for free by logging into the game. Both her healing and damage scale off of her attack. Dikke is a good sub-DPS unit to have alongside Melania. Both units have the Beast Afflatus, so they are a great pair when facing Plant-type enemies. Dikke provides extra healing when allies are below 50%.

Sonetto and An-an Lee in Reverse: 1999 are both great buffers for Melania. They each fill the same role and can be used interchangeably because they increase damage by 20%, while also reducing damage taken by 20%. An ideal team would be Melania as the main DPS, Sonetto or An-an Lee as a buffer, and Medicine Pocket to debuff the enemy. This team would completely support Melania&#39;s immense damage output.
