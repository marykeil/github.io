## Literature Review

Wordle is a simple daily word game that has taken the internet by storm. With only 6 chances to get the right answer, players may need a little help.





These types of guessing games have been around for a long time. One of the originals was called Mastermind, where players are tasked with guessing a row of colored pegs that utilizes the same hint systems found in Wordle. If players would like to try the game for themselves, it can be found on the Wordle website, which creates a new puzzle every day, keeps track of players&#39; win streaks and guess distribution, and has a popular sharing ability.





 

Screen Rant&#39;s gaming editor shared his Wordle win from December 31st, 2023 on Twitter saying &#34;The last one of the year and a solid win-in-two!&#34;

Simple games, like Wordle, are the perfect small distraction for the day. The game itself doesn&#39;t take up too much time and is a nice break during the standard morning routine. Being able to compare with friends on social media sites makes Wordle even more addicting by adding the element of competition. With the win streak tracking feature and social media sharing button, Wordle is the perfect little puzzle to spend 3-5 minutes on during a workday.

               Wordle   Released:   2021-10-01    Developer(s):   Josh Wardle    Genre(s):   Puzzle    Platform(s):   iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows    ESRB:   E    Publisher(s):   Josh Wardle, The New York Times Company    Summary:   Wordle is a web-based word-guessing game developed by Josh Wardle that took the world by storm in 2021. Players are given a five-letter word to guess and have six attempts to get the word correct. When they get a letter correct, it will mark itself as green if it&#39;s in the correct position and yellow if it is the correct letter in the wrong position. A yellow letter also means that letter could appear more than once. Wordle was purchased by The New York Times Company in 2022 and added to their website and app, keeping the core game free to play as promised - with additional words and other bonuses available through subscription, and is available via browser, iOS, and Android.    How Long To Beat:   1h 25m
