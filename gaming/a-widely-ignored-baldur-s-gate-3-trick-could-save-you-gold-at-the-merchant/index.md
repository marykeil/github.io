## Literature Review

In Baldur’s Gate 3, all that gold spent at merchants can add up. One easily overlooked trick can save thousands, even if it doesn’t always make sense.




One overlooked Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 feature could easily save players thousands of gold, if they would only learn to manipulate it. There&#39;s plenty to buy and plenty to sell in the Forgotten Realms, and the flow of commerce all centers on BG3&#39;s diverse range of merchants. They&#39;re quite a departure from the usual RPG approach to shopping: instead of carrying the same inventory of generic potions and tools, with incrementally improving weapons and armor as the game goes on, many merchants have inventories full of rare, one-of-a-kind items. They&#39;re a reliable source of gear, and always worth checking when the party arrives in a new town.




But all that gold can add up, and it&#39;s not always easy to make money in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. In the new, harder Honor Mode for BG3, buying prices are even higher, and selling prices are even lower. Plus, there are other things that are worth saving up a bit of gold for. Gold can get the party out of trouble, into exclusive areas, or through leaner days when they run out of camp supplies. However, it&#39;s all too easy to miss the simplest and most effective way to save a pretty penny in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Just Made One Major Choice Way Less Appealing   Patch 5 added a secret epilogue for Lae’zel among its many changes, and it makes a major choice at the end of Act 1 worth skipping completely.   


 How To Save Tons Of Money At BG3&#39;s Merchants 
         

It may seem a bit counter-intuitive, but bribing merchants with a bit of gold can result in lower prices across the board in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Each NPC may like or dislike Tav to varying degrees, and their opinion of the party is represented by a numerical value the game calls Attitude. It may have escaped many players&#39; notice on the busy Trade menu, but there&#39;s an Attitude gauge beneath every merchant&#39;s portrait, represented by a bar that proceeds from red to green.




Attitude directly informs the percentage by which merchants mark up their prices, so giving them a little gold can decrease how much Tav will pay throughout the store. Bribes are the simplest way to raise a merchant&#39;s Attitude: give them a bit of gold, and watch the gauge start to creep upward. If the party doesn&#39;t have the gold, unbalanced trades work equally well: simply use the Barter menu, place whatever goods the party can spare on the auction block, and tweak the merchant&#39;s offer until they receive less gold than the sold items would normally be worth.

But there are other ways to keep a merchant&#39;s affinity high. For one thing, the party should never commit any obvious crimes within their line of sight. Anyone who watches the party break the law will undergo a slight decrease in Attitude towards them, even if the transgression was accidental and there are no greater consequences for it. If possible, the party can also do the merchant a good turn for a greater Attitude gain - perhaps they have a side quest to offer, or can benefit from the results of a particular main quest choice.




If a merchant only has one thing the party wants, or just a few low-priced items, bribing them may not be worth it; they may spend more on bribery than they&#39;ll save in the long run. However, if they&#39;re looking to purchase multiple, high-cost items, it&#39;s definitely worth a try. And with the use of one additional exploit, maxing out merchant Attitude is even easier.



 Withers Can Help Save Even More Money In BG3 
          

Players can even use Withers&#39; services to their advantage in order to further decrease the money they spend at merchants, while still being able to raise their Attitude to the maximum. The amount of gold required to raise a merchant&#39;s Attitude depends entirely on Tav&#39;s level when they speak to the merchant. As a result, more gold is needed to get the biggest possible discount in the late game. The chart below demonstrates how much gold is required to bring a merchant&#39;s Attitude from neutral to maximum, depending on Tav&#39;s level at the time.




 Tav&#39;s Level  Gold Required to Max Out Attitude   1  400   2  500   3  600   4  800   5  1,000   6  1,400   7  1,800   8  2,400   9  3,000   10  3,600   11  4,500   12  4,500   






                  After Five Patches, Withers Finally Shows His True Power In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Baldur’s Gate 3 released Patch 5, which ties up a lot of loose ends and provides closure for the journey. It also shows Withers’ real power.   

That can price higher-level characters out of bribing late-game merchants; Tav is less likely to drop 4,500 gold just to save a fraction of that on one item. However, Withers will happily reset Tav to level one for a measly 100 gold, at which point they can return to their desired merchant, max out their Attitude for a cool 400, and buy whatever they&#39;d like at the lowest price available. It takes a little more effort, but this trick can start saving Tav money as early as level three. Simply maxing out a merchant&#39;s Attitude at level three costs 600 gold, while respeccing before maxing out only costs 500.



 Other Money-Saving Tips In BG3 
          




Bribing merchants is useful, but it&#39;s hardly even necessary with a rogue in the party. If Tav is struck by buyer&#39;s remorse, they can simply steal all their gold back from a merchant after the transaction is complete. This is easiest when the thief has expertise in sleight of hand, which is especially easy for a rogue like Astarion to take on. Of course, getting caught stealing will result in a huge Attitude loss, so take care and consider saving before trying this trick.

Whenever possible, the party should also sell any gems and ingots they&#39;re carrying. They may seem important, but these valuable items are actually useless, except as trade goods. Jewelry can also fetch a decent price, but shouldn&#39;t always be sold out of hand. Some pieces are considered magic items, which means they may have special effects when equipped, or can be used to help Gale in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. As a result, it&#39;s important to double-check jewelry before selling it, just to ensure it doesn&#39;t have any magic effects.




Other than that, the party should simply steal and sell everything that&#39;s not bolted down. It&#39;s easy to sell stolen items in BG3; merchants don&#39;t tend to ask questions. As long as it can be safely grabbed while out of sight, it&#39;s always worth stealing, even if the party is just going to sell it immediately after. Keeping a healthy stock of Thieves&#39; Tools can open the way to even more valuable treasure, but the knock spell, which immediately opens any non-magical lock, is more reliable.

Bribery is a simple trick, but an effective one. Especially when combined with Withers&#39; respeccing abilities, it can be used to great effect, easily saving thousands of gold over the course of a BG3 run. It&#39;s often been said that one has to spend money to make money, and that maxim holds true in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
