## Literature Review

Stitch&#39;s Friendship Quest &#34;Making Music&#34; has him choose a hobby in Disney Dreamlight Valley, which leads him to ask you for help in forming a band.





Before you can start &#34;Making Music,&#34; you must complete the other quests related to Stitch in Disney Dreamlight Valley. You must be Friendship Level 10 with Stitch before the alien lets you know about their search for band members. When you begin, you are tasked with finding two additional people from among the villagers who can play instruments and who would fit the band best.






There are five people in the village who can play instruments, including Kristoff, Merlin, Remy, Eric, and Ursula. Kristoff and Eric are both excellent choices here due to their ability to play the lute and flute respectfully.

 How To Help Stitch For The &#34;Making Music&#34; Quest In Disney Dreamlight Valley 
          

The next way to help Stitch in the &#34;Making Music&#34; quest is to build sound equipment and have two separate photo shoots once it is created. You can get everything you need from Scrooge McDuck, who is thankfully one of the few characters without a sleep cycle in Disney Dreamlight Valley. According to YouTube creator GosuNoob, however, Scrooge won&#39;t help until you create a photo backdrop.


 




A photo backdrop can be made using 20 Hardwood, 10 Glass, 10 Fabric, and 9 Tinkering Parts. Hardwood is a natural resource from the Forest of Valor, Glade of Trust, Sunlit Plateau, or Frosted Heights areas. The rest of the materials you need are made through crafting, with Glass requiring 50 Sand from Dazzle Beach and 10 Coal as an example.

The remaining items are made from 50 Cotton needed to produce 10 Fabric, with seeds for the Cotton being scattered around the Sunlit Plateau to collect and grow back in the village. Finally, 9 Tinkering Parts are constructed using 6 Iron Ingots, which you may mine from iron ore in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Once you build the backdrop, Scrooge will prepare a photo shoot location on the third floor of Dreamlight Castle.

Go to the photo shoot with Stitch and take three photos of the adorable little blue ball beside the backdrop in Disney Dreamlight Valley. From here, Scrooge will take 24 hours to collect the equipment for you to collect again later. Remember that you cannot pursue the quest during the waiting period, so maybe find someone else you need your help with before you can grab the photo shoot when Scrooge eventually calls.




When the equipment is ready, take it to Dazzle Beach and take a group photo with Stitch&#39;s whole band. This will complete the &#34;Making Music&#34; quest in Disney Dreamlight Valley, rewarding you with &#34;Stitch&#39;s Little Red Ship,&#34; a new piece of furniture you can use for decoration.
