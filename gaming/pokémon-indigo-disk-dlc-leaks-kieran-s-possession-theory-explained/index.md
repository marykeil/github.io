## Literature Review

There is a popular theory about the story of Kieran’s possession in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all the details.




The theory that Kieran is possessed in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is being highly debated and there are plenty of leaks and circumstantial evidence that point toward the rumors being true. While the Indigo Disk is the second expansion for the Gen 9 games, a part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack, it is also a semi-direct sequel to the Teal Mask, the first expansion. In The Teal Mask, Trainers set off on a field trip in the land of Kitakami, where they meet a few students from Blueberry Academy, a sister school of Naranaja and Uva Academies, respectively.

The most notable of these acquaintances are the siblings Kieran and Carmine. These students will be reencountered in the Indigo Disk DLC, once players participate in an exchange program that will take them to Blueberry Academy in Unova. Although Trainers slightly befriended them, the Teal Mask ended on a suspense note, with Kieran upset with the players and swearing to train in order to defeat them. In a sense, there could have been a massive DLC spoiler in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that was hidden in plain sight, as there are speculations about Kieran’s shift in behavior and even rumors about him getting possessed while visiting his hometown in Kitakami.

                  Pokémon Leaks: Every Legendary Pokémon Coming To Indigo Disk DLC   According to an alleged new leak, the list of returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet has been datamined.   





 Kieran May Be Possessed In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
          

According to a very popular theory, Kieran may actually not be in full control of himself, having been possessed during the events of The Teal Mask. This is, allegedly, the reason why he has such a drastic change in behavior, from a shy and friendly kid to a short-tempered challenging rival. As was previously teased by the popular Pokémon leaker known as Riddler Khu on X, Kieran will somehow go back to being the Trainer’s ally – and possibly even form the “best duo in Pokémon history.” However, before that, players may have to face Kieran in his possessed form, according to the biggest Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC rumors.



 Dokutaro May Be Controlling Kieran In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
         




As pointed out by these rumors, it seems like Kieran is being possessed and subsequently controlled by Dokutaro in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. While unconfirmed, the leaks say that Dokutaro is a peach-shaped Mythical Pokémon that is, allegedly, the leader of the Loyal Three Legendary group in Kitakami. Rumors point to Dokutaro being the one responsible for the Loyal Three’s resurrection near the shrine overlooking Mossui Town. The three creatures rise from their deadly slumber after Kieran loses a battle against the Trainer and frustratingly punches the shrine, which makes it seem like his anger is what fuels their awakening. However, Dokutaro may be behind everything.

In another enigmatic post made by Riddler Khu on X, they reposted an artwork featuring Geeta having her head enveloped by their Glimmora. Riddler Khu questions the original artist’s name, but they also ask their followers if they think “similar things would happen” in the Indigo Disk DLC, referred to by them as “Sudachi2.” Even though it is open to interpretation, the way Riddler Khu talked about the topic seems to add to the rumors that someone is being controlled by a Pokémon – and that may just as well be Kieran, controlled by Dokutaro. The mere existence of Dokutaro also seems to be in line with the main campaign.




The Loyal Three, namely Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandpiti, are all inspired by the three animals that accompany the peach-born human boy Momotaro in the popular Japanese folk tale. Ogerpon is a reference to the villain in the story, so it seems like the Teal Mask DLC was heavily inspired by the tale, though subverting the concept of good and bad. The only element left out of the expansion was the peach itself, which could finally make its appearance through Dokutaro Pokémon Indigo Disk. If the content continues to subvert the idea of good and bad from the Momotaro folk tale, then Dokutaro is likely somewhat aligned with evil intentions.

                  All Pokémon That Can Be Transferred To Scarlet &amp; Violet From HOME   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are getting over 100 creatures and forms not previously obtainable in the Generation 9 games. Here are all of them.   

The whole concept of the theory is that Dokutaro has possessed Kieran in his moment of weakness, taking advantage of his anger and feeling of betrayal to use him as weapon. The intentions Dokutaro has are unknown, but its alleged Poison-type – which would also explain why the Loyal Three are all partially Poison-type – could also be a source of connection to its evil deeds. Considering the final cutscene in the Teal Mask, it seems like Kieran got a new haircut, and that will be shown off during the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.






Once again, this may also be related to Dokutaro’s control over him – especially if the rumored Mythical creature attached itself to Kieran’s head, as implied by Riddler Khu’s post on X.






 Kieran May Go From Villain To Ally In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
          

If the theory about Kieran’s possession by Dokutaro is, in fact, true, then the young boy may have a character arc that has him go from ally to villain and back to ally once again. As implied by Riddler Khu on X, Kieran and the player’s character in the Indigo Disk DLC may end up making one of the best teams in the history of the franchise, so it seems likely that he will have a redemption arc. Even if Kieran is not actually possessed by Dokutaro, he does have to make up for his terrible behavior throughout the entire campaign in The Teal Mask.




There is a lot of mystery revolving around Kieran and how he will engage with the Trainer once they visit Blueberry Academy and see him for the first time since the last aggressive interaction they shared in front of Ogerpon’s lair in Kitakami. Kieran left without saying goodbye to the Trainer and was seen in a cutscene promising to become stronger to exact some sort of revenge. There is a chance Carmine will realize there is something wrong with her brother that needs to be fixed. Luckily, players do not have to wait too much longer as the Indigo Disk arrives for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14.
