## Literature Review

There are several exciting Pokémon that can be given via distribution events or Tera Raid battles after the release of the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC.




With the arrival of the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, several new creatures will be added to the game, in addition to a variety of returning creatures from previous Generations. In fact, the new and returning Pokémon in Indigo Disk will significantly expand the number of monsters that Trainers will be able to catch when venturing through the Gen 9 games. While some will be added with the base content of the expansion itself, there may be a few that will come via limited-time events, much like Walking Wake and Iron Leaves for the base game.
According to several Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC leaks and rumors, Scarlet and Violet will see the addition of Paradox Entei and Paradox Terrakion, but they may only be added through Tera Raid events. With the Gen 9 games wrapping up their first expansion pack, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, it may be time for developer Game Freak to double down on content offered through limited-time Tera Raids and distribution events, similar to what happened in Gen 8’s Sword and Shield. Although there are still some Pokémon missing in Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC, there are a few others that would be noteworthy and exciting additions for players.
            
 
 Which Pokémon Can&#39;t Be Transferred From Pokémon HOME After SV Update 
Although the latest Pokémon HOME update has introduced over 100 new Pokémon to Scarlet and Violet, many more are still absent. Here are all of them.












 








 10  Gensect 
Gen 5
        

Despite it appearing abundantly in Pokémon GO over the past years, Genesect does deserve an appearance in core console games. The creature is not only from the region of Unova, which could be a bridge into the rumored Gen 5 Pokémon remakes, but it also has a connection to time.
Genesect is a robotic enhanced version of a revived fossil, created by Team Plasma. With Scarlet and Violet’s temporal distortions being a recurring theme, an event focused around Genesect after the release of Indigo Disk could be a way of connecting the titles to Unova and its own temporal theme.





 9  Celebi 
Gen 2
        

Although it is not directly related to Gen 5 (or even Gen 9 for that matter), Celebi is a time-traveler and could have some justified connection to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet following the arrival of the Indigo Disk DLC. The small Mythical Pokémon from Johto is known to travel through time, and that could be a selling point to explain its addition through a distribution event or a Tera Raid.
A Shiny Celebi was given out in Sword and Shield as a promotional gift for the movie Secrets of the Jungle, along with a special scarfed Zarude. Nevertheless, the creature has not yet made it into Gen 9 titles, and that could easily be resolved with an event, thus offering a fan-favorite and nostalgic Pokémon to a whole new Generation.





 8  Zygarde 
Gen 6
        

Although it is not a Mythical and does not share a connection to any particular theme in Gen 9, an event focused on Zygarde could make it into Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after the release of the Indigo Disk DLC. The Gen 6 Legendary could be obtained in Sword and Shield’s Dynamax Adventures, but putting it up as an opponent in Gen 9 could be fun.
This is particularly true if it shows up in its Complete Forme, which resembles a giant mecha. In a Tera Raid event, Zygarde would be a formidable foe, especially if it were given the same treatment as Mewtwo in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Depending on how the event was structured, Game Freak could even give out Xerneas and Yveltal via Mystery Gift to face Zygarde for extra rewards.





 7  Deoxys 
Gen 3
        

Deoxys could be transferred to the Gen 4 remakes via Pokémon HOME, but it has not actually made an in-game appearance since Gen 6’s Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. If Deoxys were featured in a special distribution event or even a limited Tera Raid event after the release of Indigo Disk for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, their absence could be rectified.
The weird alien-like creature does not have a connection to any of the rumored games or the current Generation itself. Nonetheless, that is not a reason to not have Deoxys finally make a reappearance in core Pokémon games, especially after so much time not being available.





 6  Hoopa 
Gen 6
        

Hoopa is one of the most creative Mythical Pokémon in the series, and it would be a superb addition to the Gen 9 titles. The Psychic- and Ghost-type creature from Gen 6 was unavailable during Gen 8 and can only appear in Scarlet and Violet if transferred from Pokémon HOME.
Adding Hoopa through an event would allow new players to catch this special creature without having to transfer it away from the Pokémon GO collection, for instance. Additionally, Shiny Hoopa has not yet been distributed and is only obtainable through hacking. This could be a prime opportunity to officially put out a golden-colored Hoopa in the world.





 5  Zeraora 
Gen 7
        

One of the most popular Mythical creatures in the franchise, Zeraora made a resounding return in Pokémon Sword and Shield, especially because its Shiny version debuted through Pokémon HOME following a Max Raid event. This fan-favorite Pokémon could return in Gen 9 titles following the release of the Indigo Disk DLC.
Considering how popular Scarlet and Violet are, Zeraora could, once again, be related to a Raid challenge and then given out via Pokémon HOME, to further incentivize the connectivity between the games and the storage service. Although a Shiny one draws more attention, a regular-colored Zeraora would be more than enough to motivate players to complete a collective million Tera Raids.





 4  Victini 
Gen 5
        

Although there are quite a few important Mythicals in Unova, such as Meloetta and the aforementioned Genesect, Victini is one of the most popular ones and could be used to advertise the rumored Gen 5 remakes inside of Scarlet and Violet. Despite its Mythical status, this is curiously the first Pokémon in the Unovan Dex, which gives it a special standing among all other Mythicals in the series, which are often registered at the end of their regional Dexes.
Granted, Victini was given out in Gen 8’s Sword and Shield as a part of a limited distribution event, but the creature is still Shiny locked, and Gen 9 titles could be the best way of introducing the white-hued Victini after the release of Indigo Disk.





 3  Shiny Treasures Of Ruin 
Gen 9


 







The Treasures of Ruin Legendaries, namely Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu, have been introduced in Scarlet and Violet, but they are Shiny locked in the Gen 9 games. Through a distribution event or perhaps even a special Tera Raid event, players could put their hands on an additional copy of each Legendary, now in their Shiny forms.
The Shiny versions of Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu are coded into the game, which means they exist, so Game Freak would only have to unlock access to them in Indigo Disk – and that could be done through a fun activity. Their Shiny versions could also be a way of helping advertise the Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates set, should the Treasures of Ruin appear in their Shiny forms in cards.





 2  Shiny Loyal Three 
Gen 9


 







Like the Treasures of Ruin, The Teal Mask’s Loyal Three are also Shiny locked in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Additionally, their Shiny forms are also coded into the game. The Shiny versions of Okidogi, Fezandipiti, and Munkidori could be added through a special event.
In Gen 8, the DLC-exclusive bird trio Legendaries (Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos, and Galarian Moltres) were given out through a special battle challenge. Players who participated in battles during specific periods could later claim the Shiny versions of the birds via the Mystery Gift. This process could be repeated with the Loyal Three, following the release of the Indigo Disk DLC.





 1  Shiny Koraidon &amp; Shiny Miraidon 
Gen 9


 







Gen 9’s mascots, Koraidon and Miraidon, are also notably Shiny locked in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The signature creatures for each version of the game, respectively, also have their Shiny versions coded into the titles, which means they exist. Leaks suggest that Shiny Koraidon has a black body, while Shiny Miraidon is largely alloy-hued.
While they are unobtainable in these forms for now, they could be given out. Shiny Zacian and Shiny Zamazenta were part of a distribution event in Sword and Shield, and the same could be done with Koraidon and Miraidon. There are many exciting creatures that could be part of events in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but only time will tell what surprises Game Freak has in store for its players.
