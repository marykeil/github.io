## Literature Review

Players can obtain a Buster Sword Heirloom and in-game weapon as part of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth crossover event with Apex Legends.





The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth crossover event, which brings the Buster Sword into the game, starts on January 9 and runs until January 30. This three-week window is your only chance to obtain the Buster Sword R5 Heirloom. Additionally, it&#39;s your only time to test out the Buster Sword R2R5, which is the version you can use to slice and dice opponents in-game.

 How to Unlock The Buster Sword in Apex Legends 
          

Given that the Buster Sword R5 is a Mythic melee Heirloom that can be equipped on any legend, it&#39;s no surprise that every player is focused on obtaining this version first. Unfortunately, it is the more difficult of the two to obtain and will require a fair amount of luck.

Buster Sword R5 (Heirloom)
The Buster Sword R5 can only be obtained by opening Apex Legends &amp; FINAL FANTASY™ VII REBIRTH Event packs, which are up for grabs in the in-game store throughout the event. Event packs can be purchased individually or as a &#34;Four-Pack&#34; bundle which guarantees a Legendary or Iconic item in each pack. In total, the event packs introduce 36 new items, with the Buster Sword Heirloom being one of them. The best news of all, is you don&#39;t need to complete the collection to unlock the Buster Sword R5, unlike other Heirlooms.

Buster Sword R2R5 (In-game weapon)
The in-game weapon that players can obtain is the Buster Sword R2R5. However, you can only find it in casual playlists. That means you can&#39;t obtain the Buster Sword R2R5 in ranked. In casual playlists, however, you can obtain the Buster Sword R5 through regular looting or Care Packages.

In terms of functionality, the Buster Sword R2R5 can deal both light and heavy attacks. You can also use it to block damage and dash into opponents. The coolest part is that once the meter is full, you can perform a powerful Limit Break special attack. As a result, the Buster Sword adds much more to the playing field than just looks, and it makes a compelling case for why you should try it out in Apex Legends.
