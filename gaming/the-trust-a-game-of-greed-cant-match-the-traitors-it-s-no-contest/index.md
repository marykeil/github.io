# The Trust A Game Of Greed Cant Match The Traitors (It s No Contest)


## SUMMARY 



  The Trust: A Game Of Greed falls short compared to reality TV favorites like The Traitors and Big Brother.

The character development in The Trust is lacking, making it difficult to invest in any of the contestants and their stories feel contrived.

## Literature Review

The Trust: A Game Of Greed is a cross between The Traitors and Big Brother, but it can&#39;t match the best reality TV shows. Here&#39;s why.




The Trust: A Game Of Greed season 1 is a new reality TV series dropped by Netflix on January 10, and while The Trust has elements of The Traitors, it&#39;s not nearly as good. The Traitors US season 2 premiered January 12 on Peacock and is a notably popular show modeled after The Traitors UK, also airing its second season. The Trust&#39;s release is Netflix&#39;s grab at attempting to attract fans awaiting new episodes of The Traitors. While compelling at times, the show simply can&#39;t match reality TV stalwarts such as The Traitors and Big Brother, to which it has been compared.




In The Trust: A Game Of Greed, contestants don&#39;t have to eliminate anyone. The entire cast can choose not to vote and share the money. However, through games of team building and conversations that reveal unsavory personalities and betrayals, the cast decides to eliminate fellow members of the trust, thus increasing their share of the pot. As the name suggests, the contestants&#39; greed gets the best of them. Plus, watching a bunch of level-headed reality TV stars choose to share wouldn&#39;t make for elevated entertainment. Why can&#39;t it reach the level of The Traitors?


 The Gameplay Is Less Strategic In The Trust 
         

In The Traitors, three traitors are chosen and seek to go undetected by the faithful to win the entire prize pot. However, in The Trust, the prize pot can be shared by everyone. Host Brooke Baldwin made that clear at the start of the show. While they&#39;re forced to go through team-building and character-revealing exercises, there&#39;s no reason not to simply share the money, which would initially equal $20,000 per contestant. The prize pot grows as contestants win money for the team through games.




Prize money also increases through games in The Traitors, but the contestants are forced to eliminate each other. Because contestants know they must fight to survive as either traitors or faithful, they formulate strategies to win. In The Trust, the players have minimal strategy other than seeming likable to others, which isn&#39;t particularly compelling. Personalities clash, but players appear fake and have minimal strategy since anyone can get voted off for no good reason.



 There Is Less Investment In Contestants In The Trust 
          

While The Traitors US is better than The Traitors UK due to casting celebrities rather than regular contestants, both versions inspire more investment in players than The Trust. Netflix cast a variety of individuals, from a retired grandmother with a spicy side to a Texas rancher, but it&#39;s challenging to invest in any of them. They all feel like stock characters, and their talking heads are shallow and stereotypical rather than thoughtful. While players in The Traitors seem to be there for the gameplay, the players in The Trust are held together by one characteristic: greed. Most people don&#39;t go on reality TV shows for noble reasons-- they&#39;re breeding grounds for clout-chasing-- but something about the blatant greediness for attention and wealth is too on the nose.




Contestants began trauma dumping in The Trust so aggressively that their stories felt contrived. While Julie undoubtedly had an unimaginably abusive childhood, airing out her abuse alongside millionaire Bryce&#39;s complaints that he couldn&#39;t show off his Louis Vuitton somehow ended up equally surface-level. Getting bits and pieces of contestants&#39; backgrounds and personalities in The Traitors end up painting a much more complete and interesting picture than Tolú making her entire personality her African heritage and then scolding the admittedly misogynistic Jake for commenting on it. When Tolú confronted Jake and said she was so much more than he assumed she was, she hit the nail on the head; unfortunately, Netflix&#39;s edit gave audiences one-dimensional characters.



 The Drama Is Forced On The Trust 
          




Likely due to the limited character development, the drama is forced on The Trust. It was difficult to care when Simone or Juelz were sent home because they had exhibited very little personality on the show aside from being an unemployed mother of a non-binary child (and plant) and working as a police officer with too many buttons undone on his shirt. Fellow contestants were too quick to both make judgments and call themselves family. Brian and Jake&#39;s shock and upset when contestants are eliminated is laughable, given the shallow level of connection between players. In The Traitors, the players are shown getting to know each other deeply and working together in team-building exercises. The relationships and drama are not forced and instead unfold naturally.

Netflix&#39;s attempt at a Traitors spinoff is middling at best. While the premise is compelling, The Trust falls flat regarding character development, forced drama, and strategic gameplay. Only the first four episodes have been released, so there&#39;s a chance to redeem itself over several episodes. Although it may not be as good as The Traitors, it&#39;s still difficult to turn off.






The Trust: A Game Of Greed episodes 1-4 are available for streaming on Netflix.
