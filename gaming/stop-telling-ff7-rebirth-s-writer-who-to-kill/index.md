## Literature Review

It seems like fans of Final Fantasy 7 want to have a say in the narrative outcome of FF7 Rebirth, according to the lead writer for the game.




The lead writer for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Kazushige Nojima, has kindly asked fans to stop suggesting who developer Square Enix kills off in the new entry in the remake series. FF7 Rebirth is the second title and will follow the group led by Cloud Strife immediately after the events that took place during Final Fantasy 7 Remake and the collapse of the Sector 7 plate. In the new game, players will venture beyond the boundaries of Midgar and explore an open-world map, visiting iconic locations such as Costa del Sol and Cosmo Canyon.

It just so happens that, in the original game, Aerith is killed by Sephiroth, having her body unexpectedly impaled by his immense sword. This is considered one of the most shocking deaths in the history of games and is used as a reference for narrative plot twists to this day. It is expected that FF7 Rebirth will cover this portion of the story, even with several Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth theories, and it seems like fans want to have a role in the outcome, according to the lead writer.

As reported by VGC, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s writer, Kazushige Nojima made a post on X, asking fans to stop telling who he should kill. While Aerith is the main contender due to her previous history of being slaughtered by the villain, the indications of an alternate timeline also suggest that Tifa may be on the receiving end of Sephiroth’s sword. According to Nojima, however, fans are sending messages to him on X, telling him to spare characters they enjoy and kill off those they do not like. “I write every character with love,” mentioned Nojima in the post.

Nojima also warns these fans that if the messages with such requests continue, he will block them. “I don’t want to block or mute too many of you, and I don’t want to lock my account,” said Nojima on X. The fact is that, despite the desires and vocal requests of many fans, this will not change what is planned narratively in FF7 Rebirth. The roster of characters in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is fairly large and, considering the direction the story is heading, it seems like everyone is at risk. Alternatively, Sephiroth may not get what he wants in this game.




Exactly how the story of FF7 Rebirth will progress is still a mystery, especially after the end of FF7 Remake and the promotional material for the new game so far. It seems like Square Enix is manipulating spectators in order to subvert expectations and use any plot twists as narrative tools to further involve players. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be released for PlayStation 5 consoles on February 29, 2024.
