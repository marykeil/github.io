## Literature Review

Smite, the classic third-person MOBA, is receiving a surprise sequel on a brand-new engine with a ton of changes and enhancements. 




Smite 2 has been announced, ushering in a new age for the third-person MOBA. Earlier this week, Screen Rant got the opportunity to speak to the developers of Smite 2, Iron Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios, to get a better idea of what people should expect from the surprise sequel. Smite 2, like its predecessor, will be a completely free-to-play game with opportunities to purchase cosmetics via in-game microtransactions.




The original Smite was released on March 25, 2014, and quickly amassed a huge player base and community that developed around it. Today, a huge competitive scene exists, with top teams competing at the Smite World Championship every year. Though the sequel looks to capture what people love about Smite, it will also be a completely new, standalone title, and quite a bit of change is on the way.

 Smite 2 Will Include A Massive Graphics Overhaul 
         

Smite 2 will utilize Unreal Engine 5.2&#43;, boasting all new textures, graphics, and higher-fidelity environments than was possible with the original Smite, which ran on Unreal Engine 3. As it&#39;s been nearly a decade since Smite was released in 2014, the new engine should be a huge improvement. That said, graphics aren&#39;t the only thing the new engine will unlock for the game, as the developers emphasized a greater ability to execute ideas, from the user interface to abilities and functions, including the new &#34;use&#34; button, within the game itself.






 Smite 2 Gods Details 
          

Smite 2 will introduce an all-new God named Hekate, a Greek goddess and sorcerer with magical powers and the ability to open interdimensional portals for greater mobility on the map. A healer, she will be the first new God added to the game.

According to the developers, Smite 2 will slowly introduce more Gods over time, starting with a modest 25-50 god roster. This minimal approach is, in part, by design, as the more limited pool of characters to choose from should help new players acclimate themselves to core gameplay concepts.



The original Smite has 129 playable gods.







More realistically, it&#39;ll also provide Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez with the ability to concentrate on tweaking and perfecting elements of the base game without having to add hundreds of gods at launch. The expectation is that eventually, all of the Gods from the original Smite should make their way to the sequel.

 Smite 2 Has A Variety Of Quality Of Life Improvements 
          

Smite 2 will greatly streamline certain elements of Smite&#39;s MOBA gameplay to make it more appealing to new players. This includes better onboarding via tooltips and other helpful in-game directions that should make things like building items easier and more intuitive. As a result, it should cut down on time spent inside shop screens and be much easier for new players to comprehend. In addition, all Gods will now be able to build all items, opening the door for more unique builds and gameplay choices.






When we started to plan what we wanted to accomplish with Smite 2, one of the major things was this was an opportunity to reset the players&#39; expectations and how they engage with the game so that new players have an easier time getting into the game, as well as existing Smite players enjoying the quality of life improvements and changes to the existing Gods that are migrating. - Travis Brown, Executive Producer, Hi-Rez Studios




Useable items will have two separate slots, so items like the Blink Rune can be pressed with a hotkey. Changes to the ranked ladder will also take place with improvements in ranked matchmaking that should make it easier to slot into games with other players at the same skill level. The developers will also be removing the ranked cap, leaving the ladder open for new people to claim the number one position, with new ranks also being added in Smite 2.

In addition to these gameplay additions and changes, Smite 2 will be overhauling and streamlining certain mechanics in the game, which should make the standardized and procedural nature of pre-lane setups for both teams less daunting and confusing to new players. This approach should open the doors to new styles of play and provide opportunities for a wider variety of strategies.






 Smite Skins Will Not Carry Over To Smite 2 
          

Smite 2 will not carry over the 1,600 skins in Smite, as the game is an entirely new experience with its own set of skins that will need to be purchased separately. That said, there are a few important caveats to note. Titan Forge and Hi-Rez said it would introduce a new Legacy Gems system, where every gem used in Smite will generate a Legacy Gem in Smite 2. Additional rewards for Smite 1 players will also come in the form of Divine Legacy, a battle-pass-like system that tracks previous Smite gameplay and provides unique rewards and cosmetic items for being a long-time player.



Players can double their Legacy Gem generation by purchasing the Smite 2 Founders Pack.









 Smite Alpha And Beta Details 
          

The Smite 2 Alpha will occur sometime in the Spring of 2024, and the Open Beta for Smite 2 should take place mid-late 2024, according to the developers. People can sign up for both the Alpha and Beta test periods on the Smite 2 website. The developers will continue to keep the community updated with regular updates on Smite 2&#39;s progress while it completes its development.

As with every sequel to a major live-service game, the most-asked question is typically what happens to the previous game in the franchise. According to Iron Forge and Hi-Rez, there is no planned end-of-life for Smite, and they pointed toward the idea that as long as there is a player base for the original title, development, support, and servers for the game will remain active. That said, Iron Forge Games was incredibly hopeful for Smite 2. If the game lives up to expectations, players should flock to the new and upgraded title naturally.
