## Literature Review

22 Cult Stashes can be found in Alan Wake 2 to give you new items, but all these collectible locations have puzzles whose solutions open their loot.





There are 22 Cult Stashes in the Watery, Bright Falls, and Cauldron Lake areas, marked on your map as small container symbols. Some of these locations can be among the hardest-to-find collectibles in Alan Wake 2, especially if you don&#39;t have items like the Bolt Cutters to reach certain spots. You can actually reveal the Cult Stash icons on every region by finding a series of maps inside the Kalevala Knights Workshop in &#34;Return 3: Local Girl.&#34;




                  &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review   Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedyâ€™s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.    


 Every Cauldron Lake Cult Stash Location &amp; Puzzle Solution 
          

Only five Cult Stashes are found in Alan Wake 2&#39;s first area, with a few containers you can only reach by progressing through the story. Every puzzle for a Stash depends on the padlock, which either showcased numbers, symbols, or sometimes even an entire keypad. There are four different types of Stash puzzles, ranging from math problems to a mini-game of Simon Says with flashing symbols.

 Every Watery Cult Stash Location &amp; Puzzle Solution 
          

Watery&#39;s map holds eight Cult Stashes with puzzles that should be familiar to you at this point in Alan Wake 2. Managing to open all the containers tied to these collectibles will not only reward you with an achievement but also a special item called the Lighthouse Key. As its name suggests, this item lets you enter the locked Watery Lighthouse for another set of rewards.



Be careful as you enter Watery since there is a point of no return at this point in Alan Wake 2 that prevents you from searching for Cult Stashes if you continue following the main story to its final moments.
