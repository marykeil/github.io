# Razer Fujin Pro Review Extreme Comfort &amp; Minimalist Design Make This A Winner 


## SUMMARY 



  The Razer Fujin Pro is a departure from the company&#39;s usual aesthetic, with a more discreet design that can fit well in an office setting.   Assembly of the chair is easy and can be done solo in under a half hour, thanks to clear instructions, well-organized pieces, and helpful tools.   The chair&#39;s functionality is top-notch, with adjustable features like Synchro-tilt Technology and 2D lumbar support, making it comfortable for long periods of use. The 4D padded armrests are especially impressive and support varied gaming positions. The only downside is the headrest&#39;s positioning.

## Literature Review

The Razer Fujin Pro shes some of the company&#39;s more divisive design elements and arrives at a sleek, functional, and impressive result.




The Razer Fujin Pro is a game-changer for the company&#39;s line of top-end gaming products. Previously, I&#39;ve held Razer&#39;s product line in pretty high regard for its functionality and consideration for the little things that matter to FPS, MMO, and other genres of gaming. The main issue - at least for me - has always been aesthetics. While I know for a fact there are plenty of people who enjoy the neon green-on-black look that has been a Razer staple since the company&#39;s inception, it&#39;s never seemed to quite mesh with the rest of my office or gaming setups, standing out a little too much for my liking.




The Fujin Pro is Razer&#39;s latest gaming chair. From a visual standpoint, it&#39;s a remarkable departure from what the company has been best known for. Instead of loud colors and futuristic design, the Fujin Pro would have zero issue being used in an office setting. It&#39;s black, has the form of an ergonomic office chair, and doesn&#39;t have any of the accents that would mark it as being made by a gaming company, save the Razer logo, which is on the back of the chair and a small tag on the front (which features green font - look, the company has a brand, and I understand). Overall, it&#39;s the kind of design that will likely lose some of the audience that wants things as loud as possible, but appeals to older loyalists who want a more discrete product from Razer.

 Assembly Made Easy 
          

Of course, it&#39;s still Razer. Right from the beginning of assembly, there are nods to gaming culture. The instructions on the outside of the box reference industry staples and the assembly gloves - sorry, &#34;Builder&#39;s Gauntlets&#34; - do the same. The packaging makes the Fujin Pro feel more like a Razer product than the actual look of the chair, which is a nice little touch for those who enjoy the brand&#39;s consistent reverence for all things gaming.

Assembling the Razer Fujin Pro is remarkably easy. While the instructions say it&#39;s a two person job - and that&#39;s certainly recommended - I was able to assemble it on my own in just under a half hour, and that&#39;s with the usual missteps that come with lack of familiarity and trying to locate specific pieces. The chair neatly slots onto its bottom half and isn&#39;t too heavy, so no part of the assembly was a struggle. The instructions are extremely clear, pieces come well-organized, and the tools that come with the chair help make its construction process a breeze. Having built a few different gaming chairs over the years, I&#39;d say that the Fujin Pro was the easiest by a fair amount.






 Functionality That&#39;s Top Tier 
          

The Razer Fujin Pro is at its best when in use, not on display. It&#39;s fully adjustable with Synchro-tilt Technology with Tilt-tension Control, which essentially means it can support virtually any sitting position, as long as it&#39;s at least pretending to be somewhat ergonomic. Synchro-tilt means the chair shifts to match its user&#39;s posture, which sounded negligible until I tried it - it makes a world of difference, and as someone with some minor back issues, I found sitting in the Fujin Pro to be more comfortable than other gaming chairs over a longer period of time.

2D lumbar support also makes the Fujin Pro customizable for the varied needs of a prospective owner&#39;s height, giving precise support for posture that is adjustable should the chair be shared across multiple people. The aluminum alloy frame just feels solid - even during assembly, it had a weight to it that indicated durability.

The real star of the show, at least to me, is the 4D padded armrests, which help support varied postures and gaming setups. As an FPS fan, I like having my right arm tilted towards the center of my body and my left arm straight, something that not every chair has been readily able to support. The Fujin Pro lets me tilt the right armrest to match the angle of my arm while I&#39;m playing, ensuring my arm isn&#39;t &#34;floating&#34; during flicks or precise movement.

The Razer Fujin Pro also comes with a mesh back with a high tensile strength that doesn&#39;t make it feel like mesh while sitting in it - but certainly offers the breathability you&#39;d want out of that design. The only knock against the desgin&#39;s functionality to me is the headrest, which feels like it doesn&#39;t sit quite where it should to match up to my neck and shoulders. That said, it&#39;s fully adjustable too, and could just be an issue of me not having a good sense of where I need it - though over a month of use, I haven&#39;t been able to find much of a use for the headrest.






 A Premium Chair Worth Consideration 
To be honest, the biggest hurdle in deciding whether or not to purchase a Razer Fujin Pro is the price - it&#39;s hefty, coming in at $1049 USD at time of writing. It&#39;s certainly the best chair I&#39;ve ever sat in, but it&#39;s also considerably the most expensive, too.

For those with the budget for it, though, the Razer Fujin Pro feels like a real contender among gaming chairs that also consider ergonomics a primary concern. There&#39;s nothing being sacrificed here to make it a &#34;gaming&#34; chair that goes against good practice for back and body health, and the combination of options alongside excellent construction makes the chair one of the best available. I&#39;d highly recommend it and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future as my only gaming and office chair.

The Razer Fujin Pro is available now on the Razer Store. Screen Rant was provided with a Fujin Pro for the purpose of this review.
