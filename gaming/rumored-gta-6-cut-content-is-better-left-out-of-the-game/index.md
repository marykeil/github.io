# Rumored GTA 6 Cut Content Is Better Left Out Of The Game


## SUMMARY 






  Leaked GTA 6 videos and screenshots seemingly confirmed a dynamic weather system in Vice City, similar to Red Dead Redemption 2.   Extreme weather, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, were initially planned for GTA 6 but was later scrapped due to unknown reasons.   This decision was likely for the best, as it could have negatively impacted open-world gameplay.   Post-launch episodic content for GTA 6 could potentially reintroduce cut mechanics, including new weather types, to keep players engaged.

## Literature Review

Rumors suggest Rockstar has cut extreme weather from GTA 6. This may be for the best though, as such weather could have been problematic for gameplay.




After over a decade since the last entry in the franchise was first released, some official information surrounding Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s release finally seems to be on the horizon. A huge leak of 90 early-development videos gave players their first look at Rockstar&#39;s upcoming title in September 2022, confirming the return to Vice City as a location, and the game&#39;s dual protagonists, Jason and Lucia. Now, in the build-up to Rockstar&#39;s official reveal, further details seem to be spreading online about the game&#39;s content and what has been cut during its development.




Outside the leaked video footage and images that Rockstar confirmed were legitimate, there has been a wealth of rumors that stem from &#34;insiders&#34; at Rockstar surrounding GTA 6&#39;s story details and various gameplay mechanics. Until the studio unveils its first official trailer - which Rockstar&#39;s announced will be next month for the studio&#39;s 25-year anniversary, and many have theorized will be at The Game Awards - all of these rumors should not be taken completely at face value, however many are enjoying speculating what Rockstar&#39;s first proper current-gen title could have in store.

 Extreme Weather Was Apparently Cut From GTA 6 
         

Vice City Could Have Had Hurricanes And Tornadoes
As reported by ComicBook, a well-known Rockstar Games source, Rockstar Universe claimed that &#34;extreme weather&#34; was scrapped, although it wasn&#39;t stated at what point in the game&#39;s development Rockstar decided to drop the concept. Rockstar Universe then went on to elaborate further, explaining that Rockstar initially wanted hurricanes and tornadoes in the game, but didn&#39;t know if these weather types were canceled due to technical limitations or for a different reason.





 

Although more extreme weather conditions may not be included in Grand Theft Auto 6, the earlier leaked videos and screenshots showcased a dynamic weather system with lightning and rain across Vice City. This system seemed to improve upon that of Rockstar&#39;s previous title, Red Dead Redemption 2, which already had an impressive weather mechanic featuring varying degrees of fog, wind, rain, storms, and snow. In fact, it was due to a fan openly praising the weather in Rockstar&#39;s Western epic and speculating about what could be featured in Grand Theft Auto 6 that Rockstar Universe even mentioned the latter title&#39;s cut content.

Rockstar&#39;s weather system has certainly progressed significantly since the 2000s era of Grand Theft Auto titles, as Red Dead Redemption 2 showed it interacting far more with its environment, blowing up dust and dirt and moving flags or fabric covers on carts or shelters to create a far greater sense of immersion. Therefore, fans have already expressed their desire to see how much further Rockstar can push this with its new, more powerful RAGE engine in Grand Theft Auto 6, and how it will compare to the last-gen Red Dead Redemption 2.

 Could A Greater Variety Of Weather Be Added Post-Launch? 
Rockstar&#39;s Rumored To Be Reinstating Cut Content Episodically
          

It has long been rumored that Rockstar Games plans to release new ongoing content for Grand Theft Auto 6 episodically after cutting so much from the game to finally get it launched without putting its developers through an extreme crunch after such a long development cycle. This would be a first for the franchise, but could also keep those who prefer the series&#39; story-driven content returning to the title without depending too much on GTA Online. If so, it&#39;s possible that the studio could reintegrate its cut mechanics through this post-launch content.



Rumors suggest that Rockstar is targeting a Holiday 2024 release for Grand Theft Auto 6, though nothing has been confirmed.







GTA Online already had seasonal weather conditions such as snow as part of its Christmas events. Therefore, while snow is unlikely to be an occurrence in a Floridian location such as Vice City, it&#39;s possible that the studio could add different weather types for the occasional episode as an extra feature for players to come back and experience alongside other potential cut content such as locations or levels, depending on how far into development these features had been removed.

 The Novelty Of Extreme Weather Could Wear Off Quickly 
Such Intense Conditions Would Have More Impact In Select Missions
          

Although the real-world Florida does have extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, and tornadoes had been included in Grand Theft Auto 5 via mods such as &#34;The End of Los Santos&#34;, it seems like a wise choice to cut them from Rockstar&#39;s fictional version in Grand Theft Auto 6, at least in the game&#39;s open-world sections. Inclement weather like tornadoes or hurricanes would be impressive at first, but once the novelty wears off, itâ€™s got diminishing returns as a gameplay factor once players have experienced it, and could affect some of the freedom the Grand Theft Auto games are known for.




For example, if players are trying to escape the police in a sports car with little traction, something as simple as heavy rain can add extra difficulty with steering or aiming their weapons. A hurricane, however, would just be infuriating if it were to randomly spawn in such a situation and could potentially ruin the open-world experience after a while, depending on the frequency with which such events occur.

Such weather conditions would be much better used to build tension and atmosphere during a specific, potentially climactic set piece in Grand Theft Auto 6. A slightly more scripted sequence where Lucia and Jason are using selected vehicles and are in a specific part of Vice City could allow for more control over the impact of the weather without disrupting the action and could make for a cinematic escape or final showdown in the middle of a Vice City that&#39;s ravaged by some of the aforementioned extreme weather types.
