## Literature Review

Modern Warfare 3 is only a short way away, but its exact launch times vary by region and purchased edition. Hereâ€™s everything there is to know.




Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will be available soon, but exactly when depends on a variety of factors. The third game in the Modern Warfare reboot series, Modern Warfare 3 includes a variety of characters, game modes, and equipment from throughout the franchise. It also introduces a pair of new game modes: Cutthroat, a three-versus-three team deathmatch, and an open-world multiplayer Zombies mode with gameplay similar to Warzone 2.0&#39;s DMZ. Plus, it updates all the usual things that come along with a new Call of Duty release, with new maps, weapons, and missions for all its major campaign and multiplayer modes.




MW3 will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam or Battle.Net, with the potential for a Game Pass release in the future. Thankfully, release dates don&#39;t vary by platform in this case. But exactly when MW3 is due out depends on each player&#39;s region, preferred game mode, and purchased edition. Still, it&#39;s important to know that while some can already start playing the game, others will have to wait until much closer to launch to even download it to their consoles. Here&#39;s everything to know about when MW3 launches worldwide, as well as a quick look at its preseason content.

                  Every November 2023 Video Game Release Date (All Games Out This Month)   As the weather gets colder &amp; winter approaches, there are lots of great game releases to stay inside and play all throughout November.     


 When Is MW3 Preloading Available? 
          




Modern Warfare 3&#39;s campaign mode is already available for preloading, and can already be played in early access, but it&#39;s still not too late. Preloading began on November 1, 2023, with the campaign mode playable in early access the day after. Early campaign access is a free add-on for any and all pre-orders of the game, and pre-orders will remain available until its full release date. As a result, even those who haven&#39;t already pre-ordered MW3 can still do so, and can begin downloading and playing the campaign immediately after.

Early access ends and universal preloading begins at 10 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on November 8, 2023, at which point anyone who&#39;s purchased MW3 can begin downloading it regardless of the edition they own. This includes all campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies modes, and is available on all platforms. Of course, this is just when preloading unlocks for all players. Those who don&#39;t have early access will still have to wait for the game&#39;s full launch to play it at all, while multiplayer and Zombies won&#39;t be available to anyone until the game&#39;s full launch in their region.






 When Is MW3&#39;s Full Launch? 
         

Modern Warfare 3 will be fully launched worldwide for all platforms by 9 PM PST on November 9, 2023, but exactly when players will be able to access it depends on their region. Organized by time zone, here&#39;s how MW3&#39;s launch will be rolled out:

 Time Zone  Time &amp; Date of Launch   Pacific Standard Time (PST)  9 PM, November 9   Central Standard Time (CST)  11 PM, November 9   Eastern Standard Time (EST)  12 AM, November 10   Brasilia Time (BST)  2 AM, November 10   Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)  5 AM, November 10   Central European Time (CET)  6 AM, November 10   Korea Standard Time (KST)  2 PM, November 10   Japan Standard Time (JST)  2 PM, November 10   Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)  4 PM, November 10   







 



 When Do Pre-Order And Campaign Rewards Become Available In MW3? 
          

Pre-orders and campaign completion unlock certain rewards in Modern Warfare 3, but those may not be available immediately for players in early access. Pre-order bonuses for the base edition include early access to the campaign and the Zombie Ghost Operator skin on all platforms, plus the Lockpick Operator Pack on PS4 and PS5. The Vault Edition includes all that, plus the Soul Harvester Tracer Weapon Blueprint, the Nemesis Operator Pack, two Weapon Vaults, and a season-long subscription to MW3&#39;s BlackCell battle pass with an additional 30 tier skips.




                  Modern Warfare 3: The Best Graphics (&amp; Performance) Settings For PC   To make sure your PC runs Modern Warfare 3 best, there are certain graphics and performance settings that shape the action into the best it can look.    

There are a variety of rewards for the 15 missions that make up MW3&#39;s campaign, many of which can be helpful in its multiplayer modes. These include Operators, Calling Cards, and Tokens to help earn XP faster in MW3, as well as a Weapon Blueprint for full completion. However, players who complete the campaign in early access may not see these rewards immediately. Those who participated in MW3 beta tests may also have unlocked in-game rewards, which might not appear in their accounts during early access.

All in-game rewards for pre-orders, beta tests, and campaign completion should be unlocked by the time of the game&#39;s full launch, at 10 PM PT on November 9 or as varies by region above. These in-game rewards are only usable in multiplayer modes anyway, so there&#39;s not much that players will be able to do with them before the full multiplayer launch.






 When Does MW3 Season One Begin? 
          

MW3 divides its multiplayer content into seasons, each of which includes a new progression roadmap, a variety of new unlockables, and new content for its major multiplayer modes. The game may launch fully on November 9, but its first season of multiplayer content won&#39;t begin immediately. MW3&#39;s multiplayer preseason begins on November 10, 2023, and is scheduled to last until early December, at which point Season One will begin. That means its first major content updates should be available roughly a month after the initial release.

If MW3 follows a similar release strategy to Modern Warfare 2, its future seasons may vary in length. MW2&#39;s earliest seasons lasted as long as three months, but in more recent days, they&#39;ve been closer to six weeks each. Whether MW3 seasons will begin at a slower rate and gradually speed up toward the end of the game&#39;s shelf life, or stick to the currently established six-week schedule remains to be seen.




That&#39;s everything there is to know about the upcoming launch of MW3. The timed international rollout may seem a bit confusing, but it&#39;s only fair. This way, the game becomes available to all players around the world at the same exact time; there&#39;s no cheating by setting the console to New Zealand time ahead of release. While early campaign access is nice for some and preloading will definitely reduce the wait time, all most players have to remember is that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will be available at 9 PM PST on November 9, 2023.
