## Literature Review

Larian Studios shared that there have been technical improvements in the optimization of Baldur’s Gate 3 for the Xbox Series S line of consoles. 




There is still a glimmer of hope for the split screen feature on the Xbox Series S version of Baldur’s Gate 3, despite the fact that the functionality is one of the factors that is impeding the popular RPG by Larian Studios from arriving on modern Xbox consoles. The game is notably missing from the platforms and the developer has already explained that problems making the split screen function work on the Xbox version of Baldur’s Gate 3 is what is keeping it from being shipped.




This is said to be an issue exclusively with the Series S, as the more powerful Series X is capable of running split screen. Nevertheless, because they are part of the same console family, they have not been allowed to ship two different versions of Baldur’s Gate 3. Larian is hard at work trying to optimize the game for both consoles, and went so far to announce that the Series S may not have split screen at all. Nevertheless, a new update on the polishing has given some hope that this may not be the case.

                  One Easily Missed Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Mechanic Will Have Companions Camping In Style   There are many mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are not evidently explained. Here is one that may make your camping sessions more pleasant.   


 Baldur’s Gate 3’s Game Director Shares Technical Progress For Xbox Series S 
          

As shared by the game director and Larian Studios’ CEO, Swen Vincke, on X, the developer’s engineers found a “nice present.” Attached to the post, Swen shows the Top RAM and Top VRAM consumption of the game on Xbox Series S, as they mention that “memory is well under control” and that the title now has a “buffer for peaks”, the lack of which was holding the team back from making Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox Series S a reality. Swen also says that this enhanced performance “will benefit all platforms” on which the game is available and that the release on Microsoft consoles is “very close.”






 Better Performance May Allow Split Screen For Baldur’s Gate 3 On Xbox Series S 
          

While Swen did not mention that this would allow the Series S version of Baldur’s Gate 3 to now support the split screen feature, it did generate some hope. In fact, Halsin’s voice actor, Dave Jones, replied to Swen’s post, asking if the newly enhanced RAM and VRAM performance improves the chances of split screen being added on the platform. There was no official reply to his inquiry, but the question alone reflects the hopes of the community. Realistically, the new graphs showcased by Swen are likely related to making the game run at an acceptable level, without too many drops in frame rate and other performance issues.


 




Essentially, the improved performance will allow the Series S version of Baldur’s Gate 3 to arrive sooner on the platform. The priority seems to be making the game run smoother on the platform, perhaps with reduced loading times, for instance. The possibility of a split screen function on the Series S is still a pipeline dream for players at this point. Nevertheless, the news shared by Swen is exciting, as it further backs up Larian’s commitment to release Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox in 2023.
