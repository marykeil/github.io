## Literature Review

Eternity Isle is the new, separate, area introduced through Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Rift In Time expansion, but players will need help to reach it.





Firstly, players will need to ensure that not only has the Rift In Time expansion been purchased, but Disney Dreamlight Valley itself is up-to-date. If the Pumpkin King Returns update introducing Jack Skellington is not active, then the game is not current and will need to be updated before proceeding.

 How To Reach Eternity Isle 
The Port Of Many Worlds Quest
         

After opening the game, a cutscene will begin that introduces Jafar via a small hologram on a disc in The Plaza of Disney Dreamlight Valley. He has an important message to deliver; all time and space is in peril. He will also share that during The Forgetting, he traveled off and discovered a new land that&#39;s beyond the valley players currently reside in. This newly featured area of Disney Dreamlight Valley is Eternity Isle, where time and space are studied.

Unfortunately, Eternity Isle has been lost in time and Jafar now needs help fixing it. This will begin The Port of Many Worlds quest, which will require players to look for a hidden Port. To start, speak with Merlin, who has more knowledge than anyone about what lies beyond the Valley. He&#39;ll instruct you to follow him to the Dream Castle where he will lead you up the stairs and to a mysterious gate. This gate leads to the Stardust Port which Merlin will explain leads to lands outside the main valley, which for now only includes Eternity Isle.






Players will be able to travel freely between the main Village and Eternity Isle by utilizing the Stardust Port. Once in Eternity Isle, note that different biomes will need to be unlocked, the same way they were in the main village. However, to unlock these new biomes, players will need the Royal Hourglass, a new tool that will be introduced by Jafar after reaching Eternity Isle.




After speaking with Merlin, head over to the Ancient Vessel and interact with it to be transported to Eternity Isle. This will transport players to Ancient Landing on Eternity Isle, where they will be greeted by Jafar. With that, players have officially reached Eternity Isle and may use the same Port to travel there at any time. Be sure to hang around there for a while though, as Jafar has some interesting new content for players, including other character additions to Disney Dreamlight Valley.
