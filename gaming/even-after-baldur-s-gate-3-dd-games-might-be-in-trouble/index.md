# Even After Baldur s Gate 3, D&amp;D Games Might Be In Trouble


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s success may not herald a resurgence in DnD video games and could be a one-off before another drought.   Previous DnD games like the original Baldurs Gate games and Planescape: Torment kept the franchise relevant, but momentum did not last.   The future of officially licensed DnD games is uncertain, with recent disappointments and canceled projects suggesting a dubious future.

## Literature Review

Quality Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games used to be released consistently, but the bleak period before Baldur’s Gate 3 calls the future into question.




The commercial success and critical acclaim of Baldur’s Gate 3 marks the end of a lengthy drought of well-received video games based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons license, but it is too early to tell if this marks a resurgence in successful DnD video game adaptations, or a one-off before another bleak period. The original Baldur’s Gate was released in 1998 following a decade of DOS-based DnD games, most of which used the Gold Box Engine, a system which catered to dungeon crawler gameplay over in-depth storytelling. Baldur’s Gate ushered in an era of beloved DnD video game classics, but the momentum did not last.




Isometric CRPG hits like Baldur’s Gate 2 and the fantastically experimental Planescape: Torment continued to keep DnD relevant in video games through the end of the 2e Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons tabletop system era. Both 3.0 and 3.5 DnD aligned with successful video game franchises, particularly Neverwinter Nights for 3.0 and Neverwinter Nights 2 for 3.5. Obsidian Entertainment’s 2007 Neverwinter Nights 2 expansion campaign, Mask of the Betrayer, easily outdid the game’s default campaign, but that high point was followed by a disappointing lacuna for licensed DnD games that did not end until 2023’s Baldur’s Gate 3. DnD games were released during that sixteen-year period, but few made any significant impact.

                  Was Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Really The Best Game Of 2023? Retrospective   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is an obvious choice for the year&#39;s best game, but declaring a single winner of such a prestigious title is rarely a simple affair.   


 D&amp;D Games Like Sword Coast Legends Were Largely Forgotten 
          




The divisive reception to the 4e era of the tabletop game seemingly bled over into the brand’s video game production, as there were no true 4e DnD video games ever released. The lackluster action RPG Daggerdale used 4e terminology, as did the initial version of the surprisingly resilient MMORPG Neverwinter, but the tabletop RPG’s uniquely tactical system was never translated properly into the video game medium. The fact that the most compelling DnD licensed game in years, before the release of Baldur’s Gate 3, was Siege of Dragonspear, Beamdog’s original campaign that bridged the gap between the first Baldur’s Gate and the second, is telling.


 

The 2015 release of Sword Coast Legends could be seen as a failed attempt at Baldur’s Gate 3, as one of the first games to use the current 5e DnD rules, and the same Forgotten Realms campaign world as its setting. Sword Coast Legends was a mediocre game, and though some DnD fans appreciated that it at least checked the boxes for a Neverwinter Nights-style experience with the new ruleset, it has largely been forgotten. In 2021, an indie RPG, the excellent Solasta: Crown of the Magister, delivered a better DnD experience than any officially licensed game had in years, using the 5e OGL.






Recent years have seen remasters of Baldur&#39;s Gate, Baldur&#39;s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance, and Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance 2, all of which are available on current gaming platforms.




Last year’s Baldur’s Gate 3 could be a sea change for officially licensed DnD games, as Larian’s long-awaited opus received near universal acclaim and swept up numerous Game of the Year awards. It could be too early for optimism, however, since Baldur’s Gate 3 comes on the heels of the disappointing Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance. Earlier eras have seen a series of solid DnD video games alongside the more well-known hits, like the original Dark Alliance games, the Xbox’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes, and the PSP’s Dungeon &amp; Dragons: Tactics. More mid-tier games could be good for the license, but the future remains unsure.



 D&amp;D Video Games Post Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Have A Dubious Future 
          




Payday developer Starbreeze Studios is working on a cooperative multiplayer game based on DnD. While fans would likely prefer it to achieve the success of the original Dark Alliance, or at least the quality of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes, the project could easily go the way of Daggerdale or the 2021 Dark Alliance. Starbreeze dabbled in fantasy gaming with the 2002 RPG Enclave, and video games based on Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness show the studio can do justice to licensed IPs. Early in 2023, Hasbro announced that at least five DnD-based video games were being canceled, and it recently laid off DnD staff members, suggesting a less rosy future.

On the tabletop side of things, mismanagement has been consistent for DnD, from the OGL debacle to the misguided “never-ending DnD edition” concept. The surprising success of Larian’s game, after years in beta, could mean DnD’s video games can fare better than the core tabletop RPG. Baldur’s Gate 3 could mark a new Renaissance for Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games, or it might take another decade, or more, before another developer rolls a natural 20.
