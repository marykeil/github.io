## Literature Review

Medicine Pocket is the best healer in Reverse: 1999, but the right healing Psychubes and powerful team comps can make them even better.






Medicine Pocket is a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns. This is a rare treat for gacha game fans, as Chinese game studios (the main producers of gacha games) typically avoid canonical LGBTQ&#43; characters in their gacha lineups.







If you want to increase Medicine Pocket&#39;s healing potential, you&#39;ll need a sturdy healing Psychube to boost their ATK while supplying extra healing. Meanwhile, you&#39;ll need to make sure their teammates are both reliable DPS units, as Medicine Pocket is not built for combat. Luckily, even if you don&#39;t have great teammates or strong Psychubes, Medicine Pocket has respectable and strong abilities as soon as you pull them.


 The Best Psychubes For Medicine Pocket 
          

As of Reverse: 1999&#39;s global launch, there aren&#39;t many Psychubes devoted to healing and survival. Some Psychubes have both a Heal and ATK tag, but they won&#39;t work well with Medicine Pocket&#39;s kit. Medicine Pocket&#39;s best Psychubes should boost the strength of their healing Incantation, Alchemy Ware, alongside the Ultimate healing unlocked with Insight One.




That Inquisitive Dear is the only 6-Star Heal Psychube available for Medicine Pocket in the early versions of Reverse: 1999. This pretty Psychube offers an 18% bonus to Healing Done when it gets to Level 60. This bonus applies to all of Medicine Pocket&#39;s healing techniques, including the new one unlocked with That Inquisitive Dear&#39;s Amplification. When Medicine Pocket uses their debuff Incantation, Inherent Habit, they&#39;ll heal the ally with the lowest HP% by up to 48% of their ATK. If Medicine Pocket has Insight One, this Psychube lets them heal with all three of their moves.

There are two 5-Star Psychubes that fit into Medicine Pocket&#39;s kit. Decode is the better alternative to That Inquisitive Dear, as it provides up to a 15% bonus to Healing Done. This Psychube focuses on protecting Medicine Pocket from Ultimates. When an enemy targets Medicine Pocket with an Ultimate, they get their DMG Taken reduced by up to 20%. If you pair this Amplification with Medicine Pocket&#39;s Sturdiness status, they should be well protected from these strong attacks.




Laughter and Laughter is the other 5-Star Psychube option for Medicine Pocket in Reverse: 1999. Medicine Pocket gets a 10% DMG Taken Reduction and special rewards for delaying their healing. Each time a round begins, Medicine Pocket gets &#43;3% Healing Done. This bonus can stack up to eight times for a powerful healing punch. Medicine Pocket will likely run through these bonuses quickly, but a small bonus is better than no bonus.



 The Best Team Comps For Medicine Pocket 
         

One of the reasons why Medicine Pocket is the best healer in Reverse: 1999 is because they can pair with a wide range of team comps. As such, Medicine Pocket is the main healer on all-star teams consisting of some of the best characters in the entire game. So long as both members of their party deal good DMG, Medicine Pocket can comfortably slip into the back and keep them alive.




If you&#39;re trying to craft an all-star team, naturally you&#39;ll want to pair the best healer with Reverse: 1999&#39;s best DPS: Centurion. Centurion is a brilliant character who gets strong DMG bonuses for each point of Moxie she owns. She&#39;s got a high Crit Rate and can deal with enemy hordes of all sizes, from masses of goons to powerful bosses. She&#39;ll need a good defense to keep her safe as she strikes, putting Medicine Pocket in the perfect position to help.

Don&#39;t own Centurion? No problem. Melania is another powerful, albeit AP-greedy, main DPS who needs Medicine Pocket&#39;s early-round support to reach her full potential. Her focus is on stealing and generating enough Moxie to trigger her Ultimate and ride the bonuses generated by her special status, Thief Master, to quickly trigger the cycle over again. She has a good Leech Rate on her Incantation, Clockwork Rats, but would greatly benefit from Medicine Pocket&#39;s DMG Taken reductions.

Since Eternity&#39;s build in Reverse: 1999 is centered around losing HP, you&#39;ll want a good healer like Medicine Pocket at her side. Eternity can keep herself safe from a wide range of statuses, but when her Incantations always take 10% of her HP, she needs Medicine Pocket&#39;s help to stay alive. With their support, Eternity can last through a dozen rounds of combat and further open enemies to attacks from her sub-DPS.




When you&#39;re looking at good support characters to pair with Medicine Pocket, you&#39;ll need one that works as a good sub-DPS to make up for Medicine Pocket&#39;s defensive focus. An-an Lee fits this category perfectly as one of the best support characters in the game. When An-an attacks with her Exorcism Time status, she easily makes up for Medicine Pocket&#39;s lack of DPS abilities. Her buff pairs well with Medicine Pocket&#39;s buffs as both work to support your main DPS of choice.

Voyager from Reverse: 1999 is another great support choice to synergize with Medicine Pocket. Both characters can apply a stack of Sturdiness to allies, reducing DMG Taken in their next hit by 25%. Voyager&#39;s Interstellar Blessing and Confusion statuses can combine with Medicine Pocket&#39;s DMG Taken debuffs to make the main DPS&#39;s next attack extra effective. Voyager also has a reliable Ultimate that can decimate a single target, hopefully, the enemy Medicine Pocket targeted with Inherent Habit.




The main thing to keep in mind with Medicine Pocket is that you can add them to any team comp and they can make do. They may work best in team comps like those above, but Medicine Pocket can adjust to any team comp. Whether they&#39;re paired with an awkward fit like Bkornblume or a horrid character like ONiON, Medicine Pocket is still the best healer in Reverse: 1999.
