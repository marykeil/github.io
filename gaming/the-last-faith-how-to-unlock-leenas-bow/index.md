## Literature Review

Leena&#39;s Bow is a special firearm you can unlock with the right blueprints in The Last Faith, giving you a ranged weapon that deals potent fire damage.





Before you can gain the Rare Prototype Blueprint that yields Leena&#39;s Bow, you must have the power to destroy Locked Doors. This ability is acquired as you progress through the game, as one might expect from the skills shown in The Last Faith&#39;s gameplay trailer. Any door marked red on your map is Locked and will show a prompt to open it once you gain the necessary talent.

 How To Get Leena&#39;s Bow In The Last Faith 
          

The NPC Mariano sells Leena&#39;s Bow after you give him the Rare Prototype Blueprints found in the secret area past the Locked Door in the Liturgical Pass. Behind the Door is a room full of broken bells and a ladder leading into another section below. Fight past the enemies here to find a chest on a ledge to your left that contains the Blueprints for the weapon you wish to have available in Mariano&#39;s shop.



Unlike the Proximo Brothers in Blasphemous 2, another pixel-based Metroidvania title, blueprints act like treasures in The Last Faith instead of collectibles.




Return to Oxnevylle&#39;s Manor to give the plans to Mariano, whom you can purchase Leena&#39;s Bow from for 9,500 Nycrux in the Firearms section of his store. The weapon has a 160% Crit Damage stat and a 5% Crit Chance score. It costs Demioxide Bullets as ammunition to attack with the Bow in The Last Faith, which you can also buy from Mariano for 60 Nycrux per bullet.

Your build must have at least 16 Mind and 12 Instinct to wield Leena&#39;s Bow, which fires a concentrated laser of pure fire that consumes Bullets as you hold the attack button. This weapon has an E scaling with Mind and a C scaling with Instinct, making it a tool defined by both attributes. You do not need a prerequisite score in Strength or Dexterity to use the Bow, even though it is a Physical tool in The Last Faith.

Those who unlock Leena&#39;s Bow in The Last Faith will have a Firearm that pairs wonderfully with many melee weapons, giving you a tool that deals devastating damage to enemies over a considerable distance as you explore.
