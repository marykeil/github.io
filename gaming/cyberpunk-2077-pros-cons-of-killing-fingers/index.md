# Cyberpunk 2077 Pros &amp; Cons Of Killing Fingers


## SUMMARY

Though the choice may appear difficult, there are actually very few downsides to killing Fingers.

## Literature Review

Finn &#34;Fingers&#34; Gerstatt is a ripperdoc in Cyberpunk 2077 with deplorable practices. What are the pros and cons of keeping this revolting ripper alive?




During the course of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s main story, V must decide what to do with Finn &#34;Fingers&#34; Gerstatt, a ripperdoc operating out of an abandoned flophouse in Jig-Jig Street. During the main campaign, players interact with Fingers while hunting for Evelyn Parker, the woman who commissioned the disastrous heist on Konpeki Plaza that serves as the climax of the game&#39;s first act. Once Fingers is found, V finds out not only the next clue to Evelyn&#39;s location, but also what type of doctor Fingers really is.

Fingers mainly treats impoverished sex workers and drug addicts out of his humble shop. A veneer of benevolence has Fingers installing cyberware for new customers at incredibly generous rates, but purposefully installing faulty, sometimes defective, second-hand cyberware leads to desperate clients returning for more procedures. Fingers then takes advantage of his clients, often sexually assaulting them, knowing they have nowhere else to turn. Upon learning this, the player is given the option to kill Fingers, though it&#39;s not made immediately clear what the ramifications of doing so would be.

 Pros Of Killing Fingers In Cyberpunk 2077 
          




Fingers is a morally reprehensible character in Cyberpunk 2077, knowingly committing medical malpractice in order to sexually abuse entrapped clients. Additionally, when V interrogates him about the whereabouts of Evelyn Parker, it is revealed that Fingers sold her off to a company that made snuff braindances without so much as a second thought. For players roleplaying a righteous V, killing Fingers to stop him from preying on the downtrodden is likely a moral imperative; vigilante justice isn&#39;t necessarily responsible on V&#39;s part, but it&#39;s the only recourse allowed by the game. Simply put, Night City&#39;s sex workers and drug addicts are safer without Fingers.



 Cons Of Killing Fingers In Cyberpunk 2077 
          

While Fingers is morally abhorrent, murder is still a crime in Night City, and V will be hunted by the police if they choose to kill Fingers, which may be objectionable to certain Cyberpunk 2077 roleplayers. Considering the number of lives V takes in the course of the game&#39;s story, however, Finger&#39;s is more or less a drop in the bucket. Although, following Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.0 update, there is no longer a best ripperdoc in Night City – each ripperdoc offers the same stock on rotation. This means Fingers does not have any unique cyberware available for purchase, so there&#39;s no tangible gameplay incentive for keeping him alive. Prior to 2.0, this was a significant downside to killing Fingers.




                  One Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 Weapon Change Makes No Sense   Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.0 update includes many gameplay improvements and has been incredibly well-received, but one weapons change seems to make no sense.   

Players have a moral decision to make when it comes to Fingers, Jig-Jig Street&#39;s resident ripperdoc. Killing him awards a bounty on V&#39;s head, but that&#39;s about it – not an especially rare deterrent considering the nature of V&#39;s usual work. Keeping him alive means avoiding a murder, but also enabling a serial abuser who preys on Night City&#39;s most vulnerable. Ultimately, it is up to the player to decide whether V lets this lascivious Cyberpunk 2077 ripperdoc live, or to punish him for his misdeeds, though the latter truly has very little downside.
