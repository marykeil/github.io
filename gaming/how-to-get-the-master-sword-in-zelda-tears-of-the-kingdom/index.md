## Literature Review

It&#39;s not an adventure without the Master Sword and Tears of the Kingdom is no exception. Here is exactly how to get Link&#39;s classic sword.





Before even finding the Master Sword, you must improve Link&#39;s Stamina for the journey ahead by collecting Stamina Vessels in Tears of the Kingdom. These artifacts add to your overall Stamina ring, sometimes even adding another meter on top of the one you already have. You are able to trade 4 Light of Blessings found from various Shrine challenges at a Goddess Statue in exchange for a single Vessel.

 Where Is The Master Sword 
          

There are two ways to retrieve the Master Sword, either through a main story quest or by finding where the weapon is early. The weapon lies on the Light Dragon, a massive beast that flies through Hyrule in a set path across the land, waiting for Link to find it. You&#39;ll eventually be forced to encounter the Dragon during the &#34;Recovering the Hero&#39;s Sword&#34; quest, which is the intended way to get the Sword in Tears of the Kingdom.

To go the quest route, head to Korok Forest and defeat Phantom Ganon for the Deku Tree. After defeating Phantom Ganon, the Deku Tree will give Link the quest in Tears of the Kingdom. The biggest benefit of obtaining the weapon this way comes from the Deku Tree is marking the location of the Master Sword on the map for you to follow.




For those that are looking to grab the sword early, a little more work will be involved. Since the location of the Light Dragon won&#39;t be marked on any map, players will need to hunt it down themselves. Luckily, the Light Dragon can be seen from the ground level of Tears of the Kingdom, especially when you use the camera to zoom in and verify it is the correct Dragon.



There are multiple Dragons flying around Hyrule in addition to the Light Dragon. To identify the creature with the Master Sword, look for a blue energy glowing on a Dragon&#39;s head that indicates the presence of the Hero&#39;s weapon.

Despite whichever route players choose to go to locate the Sword, once found, Link will need to find a way to ride the Light Dragon in Tears of the Kingdom to obtain their weapon. The best way to do this is to use a nearby Tower along the Dragon&#39;s path to launch Link into the air. From the sky, use your paraglider to float down onto the Dragon&#39;s back, or close to the creature&#39;s head where the Master Sword can be seen.






If there is no Tower around, head up to Great Sky Island and try to use the elevated height to land on the beast from there.




Once on the Dragon, Link can move about freely along its body. The Master Sword is going to be located at the head, but be sure to collect rare resources available on the way up. You must have at least two full bars of Stamina to reach the head. Stamina-boosting food won&#39;t help you here, so don&#39;t even try to waste your crafted dishes in an attempt to reach the Sword.

Reaching the head gives you a prompt to pull the Master Sword, which plays a cutscene where the Dragon will attempt to throw you off. This is where you need to have a high amount of Stamina, as Link struggles to free their weapon from the majestic beast. As Link seems to be at his breaking point, the Dragon will stop and the Master Sword will be pulled from the Light Dragon in Tears of the Kingdom.




Another short cutscene will follow these events, and then Link will be able to continue on their journey in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with the Master Sword at his side.
