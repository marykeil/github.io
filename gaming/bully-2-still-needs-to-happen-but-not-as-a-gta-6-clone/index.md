# Bully 2 Still Needs To Happen, But Not As A GTA 6 Clone


## SUMMARY 



  Bully 2 should move away from the concept of &#34;Grand Theft Auto in school&#34; and instead mimic the fresh and unique setting of Red Dead Redemption games.   A one-room schoolhouse in an old west setting could allow Bully 2 to focus on a core group of characters, building relationships and exploring the impact of the protagonist&#39;s actions on NPCs.   Bully 2 would offer a new take on the American west, allowing Rockstar to explore subversions and satirical criticisms within the tropes of the genre, while maintaining authenticity and avoiding glorification.

## Literature Review

There&#39;s one big change that could make Bully 2 stand out from both its predecessor and Grand Theft Auto 6 while still following Rockstar tradition.




Several console generations have passed since the release of Bully, but the world still deserves a Bully 2 - just not one that uses GTA 6 as a basis. Like a number of titles released by Rockstar Games, Bully courted controversy thanks to its subject matter, which put players into the shoes of a juvenile delinquent to take a look at the vicious world of a boarding school. An open-world format and a focus on misdeeds made &#34;Grand Theft Auto in school&#34; a reasonably accurate pitch for the game, but it might be best for a potential Bully 2 to move away from that concept.




Bully 2 has been the subject of anticipation and frustration alike for years, as it&#39;s never been quite clear how likely the odds of a sequel actually are. Former developers from Rockstar Games have confirmed that the company spent time working on follow-up material that never saw the light of day, but whether anything will ultimately materialize remains a mystery. The Red Dead Redemption games and recent Grand Theft Auto titles have become the main focus of the company&#39;s resources, so Bully 2 could be more likely once GTA 6 finally releases. It&#39;s certainly started up Bully 2 rumors and speculation again.

                  GTA 6 Release Date Leaks &amp; Rumors - Everything Confirmed &amp; Debunked (So Far)   GTA 6 is one of the most hotly-anticipated games in recent memory, but with Rockstar remaining quiet, there&#39;s lots of release date rumors to explore.   


 Bully Should Mimic Red Dead, Not Grand Theft Auto 6 
         




The boarding school of the original Bully made for an engaging setting, but switching it up could give Bully 2 the angle to make the idea fresh and unique again. The Red Dead Redemption games actually offer the perfect template for a new take on Bully, as seeing the old American west from the perspective of a teenager could make for an experience unlike anything the studio has yet made. Red Dead Redemption 2 had only one relevant child character, and its focus on the world of adults leaves plenty for a potential Bully 2 to explore.



Grand Theft Auto 6 rumors indicate that at least one child could have a central role in the game, which would be a first for the series.




This change of setting would significantly downscale the scope of the school itself, as a one-room schoolhouse would be more the norm for the average frontier settlement, but that wouldn&#39;t have to limit the possibilities of the game. A seamless open world including the full stretch of the town and even some surrounding countryside would open up plenty of avenues for exploration and diverse gameplay. Although the core Bully 2 gameplay loop would still need to focus on the school environment and heavily involve the protagonist&#39;s fellow students, the change in flavor would make it easy to try out new ideas that weren&#39;t present in the original Bully.




                  GTA 6 Needs To Steal Red Dead Redemption 2’s Most Important Story Feature   Grand Theft Auto 6 could learn a lot from Red Dead Redemption 2, but one feature in particular could offer the most far-reaching benefits.   



 Bully 2 Could Focus On A Core Group Of Characters 
          

One advantage of the one-room schoolhouse idea for Bully 2 is how much focus the narrative could place on the central characters. Open-world games usually have to make certain major concessions when it comes to characters, selecting a core group that gets fully fleshed out while leaving many NPCs without any memorable interactions. In an old west take on Bully 2, every student would count, and Rockstar could focus on interesting systems to build or destroy relationships in a way that could have a major narrative impact.




In the larger setting of the town, it would be gratifying to see the Bully 2 protagonist&#39;s actions affect the way they&#39;re viewed by NPCs. A small western town where everyone knows each other would spread the word of troublemaking quickly, showing a ripple effect that wouldn&#39;t likely extend far outside the school in a modern setting. The proprietor of a general store might refuse to sell to a teenager, causing their schoolteacher friend too much trouble, while less reputable figures might see an opportunity in a youngster willing to get into trouble.

                  GTA 6 Will Never Make Up For Bully 2&#39;s Cancelation   Rockstar&#39;s putting its resources into the long-awaited GTA 6&#39;s development, but this comes at the cost of sequels for its other IPs, such as Bully.   

There&#39;s also a strong tradition of placing children or teenagers in a setting of limited scope to make larger commentaries on society, a method that Bully 2 could easily employ. A one-room schoolhouse could turn into a pressure cooker of tensions and power plays reminiscent of works like The Lord of the Flies, which would be a great way to build on ideas from the first game and continue Rockstar&#39;s tradition of satirical criticism. Of course, none of that has to distract from the fun, but there shouldn&#39;t be any shortage of playful possibilities to counterbalance any serious story elements.






 Bully 2 Would Be A New Take On The American West 
          

Rockstar is consistently good at finding new ideas and subversions to explore within familiar tropes, but Bully 2 could step outside of genre traditions further than ever before. Most explorations of the American west tend to fall into similar categories to Red Dead Redemption, focusing on near-mythic figures like cowboys or outlaws and either supporting or tearing down aspects of that mythology. Although there are certainly plenty of works that do focus more on the mundane, few are all that similar to what Rockstar would bring to Bully 2.

                  10 Lessons GTA 6 Can Learn From Red Dead Redemption 2   GTA 6 doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it should borrow heavily from and improve on the Rockstar games before it. Here’s what it can take from RDR 2.   




Rockstar&#39;s acerbic edge would quickly set Bully 2 apart from stories like Little House on the Prairie that take a family-friendly approach to a focus on younger characters, and the perspective of modern writers could also give it a unique perspective from many contemporary 19th century writers. RDR2 showed a deft hand at maintaining authenticity while presenting an informed view of the setting. Bully 2 could follow up on tackling ideas like the dark side of colonizing the west in an environment that isn&#39;t likely to run into the pitfalls of glorification.

Of course, any Bully 2 would be welcome at this point, and one that sticks more to the model set by the original game and recent developments in the Grand Theft Auto series would still be plenty of fun. Imagining what all could come into play in a western setting, however, reveals just how flexible and interesting the premise is when applied to different scenarios. GTA 6 might be the future of Rockstar for now, but if Bully 2 happens to come along after, following in the track of Red Dead Redemption could be the ticket to make it something truly special.
