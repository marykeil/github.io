## Literature Review

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom includes many unique and fascinating NPCs, including these friends who would be cool to learn more about.




Since the very first game in The Legend of Zelda series, there have been many unique and creative characters that live in Hyrule, including those in the latest entry, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Some of these special NPCs may only have a few lines, yet they are compelling enough that they can leave people wanting to know more about their backstories. In some cases, a character may even have quite a bit of time with Link but still deserves more of a story arc or even a spin-off title.
As Tears of the Kingdom is a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, many of the NPCs featured in the new game were present for parts of both adventures. Having such short interactions several years apart serves only to make them even more interesting, particularly as players can see a little bit of what has and has not changed about them between the two titles, making it easy to form ideas and suppositions. Here are some of the most interesting characters that Link meets in TOTK.
            
 
 Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Completely Wastes Its Coolest Horse 
Disappointingly, the coolest horse that can be seen in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also thoroughly wasted by the game.












 








 10  Hestu Collects Korok Seeds 
The Extremely Large Korok Who Loves To Dance
        

Hestu appears to be a giant Korok who will appreciatively take the many Korok Seeds that Link gains from helping the little ones during his travels. He gives a cheerful energy to the game, whether through his gleeful delight if Link talks to him while Link is not wearing any clothes, or just from his love of dancing and music. He is the most celebrated musician among the Koroks of Korok Village and loves to perform for Link, in addition to helping expand his inventory size. This happy, oversized Korok is someone who would be entertaining to learn more about and find out his story.
            
 
 Zelda: TOTK - Why Hestu Isn’t In Lookout Landing Anymore 
Upon visiting Lookout Landing, players may discover that Hestu has seemingly disappeared into thin air - but it&#39;s easy to find his next location.








 9  Jerrin In Lookout Landing 
A Hylian Researcher
        

Jerrin is one of the researchers who, in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is found beneath Lookout Landing in the emergency bunker. She is married to another researcher, Robbie, whom she met through Purah, and they have a son, Granté (also known as Grantéson) who is an interesting character in his own right. Not only would it be amusing to hear more of how Jerrin and Robbie met and their story, but in TOTK she is also the one who accidentally broke open the hole in the wall leading to the Royal Hidden Passage. Due to the creepy, demonic voice emerging from the hole, Jerrin is sure that she is going to die...yet she continues sweeping endlessly in front of the hole.





 8  Pikango&#39;s Role Is Smaller In TOTK 
The Traveling Painter
        

Poor Pikango, the traveling painter of Hyrule, serves a much larger role in BOTW than he does in TOTK, but he is still there and feels as though a lost opportunity for some humorous side quests that could have been added to the game. In BOTW, he helps Link discover lost memories and points out a Great Fairy Fountain. In TOTK, he can help Link find an ancient text that Wortsworth wants. As the creative painter of Hyrule, in a game where creativity is at an all-time high thanks to the Ultrahand and Fuse abilities that Link has, it feels as though he could have been given a much larger creative role.





 7  Meeshy Is Looking For Rare Outfits 
A Fashion-Focused Adventurer Of Hyrule
        

Meeshy is an adventurer who appears in both games, although she was dressed in much more appropriate attire for adventuring in Breath of the Wild. In TOTK, she is on a hunt to find Misko&#39;s Treasure of rare outfits that have been hidden across Hyrule. Her cowardliness in BOTW, despite wanting to be an adventurer, mixed with her enthusiasm for fashion in TOTK makes her a very creative personality who deserves to have more of her story followed, as her character growth is quite entertaining even in these small snippets.
            
 
 Where To Find Misko’s Treasure (Powerful Outfit) In Zelda: TOTK 
Three powerful outfits are hidden as parts of Misko&#39;s treasure in Zelda: TOTK, giving players unique armor pieces if they can find these rare items.








 6  Addison Adds Humor To TOTK 
The Dedicated Hudson Construction Employee
        

Link first comes across Addison in Tears of the Kingdom, finding him very anxiously trying to ensure a sign featuring Hudson&#39;s face for the Hudson Construction Company stays upright. This eager employee sees the task of putting up signs as a heroic duty, although he clearly has no idea of what he is doing. His loyal spirit and enthusiastic energy make him a comical extra in a world where many dark and dangerous things are happening, and one wishes he could tag along for moral support for a while.





 5  Konora Can Still Be Found In TOTK 
A Gerudo Woman Sitting Under A Cherry Tree
        

Konora has very small roles in both games, but her quiet and relaxing presence is intriguing. In Breath of the Wild, she is the one who first warns Link that he cannot enter Gerudo Town because he is a man. In Tears of the Kingdom, she is found sitting under Cherry Blossom Trees across Hyrule. Their dialogue is fun as she ponders aloud whether she is destined to fall in love with Link, but then goes on to tell him the legend about the Satori.





 4  Penn Is Looking For The Missing Princess Zelda 
A Rito Reporter For The Lucky Clover Gazette


 







Penn is a fascinating character in TOTK as a Lucky Clover Gazette journalist on the hunt for breaking news, most particularly in the case of the missing Princess Zelda. Penn is a Rito, a bird-like race, and can converse with birds around Hyrule as well as with people like Link. Other Rito characters have made appearances in past Zelda games, and they seem like a fascinating group that would be fun to spend more time with. Penn, in particular, shows a tenacity that is fun in an NPC. It is too bad that he doesn&#39;t accompany Link on adventures.
            
 
 One Small Zelda: TOTK Detail About Penn Has Huge Lore Implications For Rito 
Penn displays an interesting ability in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which carries dramatic implications for the rest of the Rito.








 3  Beedle Shows Up Again In Tears Of The Kingdom 
The Traveling Hylian Merchant
        

Beedle has now been an important part of seven Legend of Zelda games, and yet very little is known about this salesman who travels the world with various goods. It is not even known if he has a family or a location he considers home. His sole purpose in life is to wander the world buying and selling. Despite not knowing anything about him, his recurring appearances have made him into a beloved character. Someday, hopefully, he will be given a larger role and people can learn more about who he truly is.





 2  Rauru Is Important To TOTK&#39;s Story 
The First King Of Hyrule


 







Rauru takes on many titles in Tears of the Kingdom, beginning with being the source of Link&#39;s new arm and his savior. For quite a while, Link doesn&#39;t know much beyond this, yet Rauru is a very important piece of Hyrule&#39;s history and the events unfolding during the game. King Rauru is a Zonai and was the first King of Hyrule alongside Queen Sonia. Back in his time, long before Link and Zelda were ever born, Rauru was responsible for defeating Ganondorf and binding him deep below Hyrule Castle, as well as many other pieces of the puzzle that make up Tears of the Kingdom&#39;s story.
            
 
 Tears of the Kingdom: Who Rauru Is (&amp; How He Fits Into Zelda Canon) 
One of the first characters Link interacts with in Tears of the Kingdom is a mysterious ghost of a Zonai named Rauru. Here’s all about who he is.








 1  Tulin Has Great Character Growth 
Young Rito And Sage Of Wind


 







One could easily argue that young Tulin already receives quite a bit of screentime in TOTK, but this heroic character is deserving of his own spinoff game due to his own remarkable character growth between BOTW and TOTK, his bravery, and certainly his fighting abilities as a Sage and warrior. From a young child who is inspired by Link and sees the hero as a role model, to a strong ally of Link&#39;s who can even help Link learn new paragliding tricks. Add in Tulin&#39;s bright personality and adorable character design, and he could easily be a protagonist of his own story whether or not it directly related to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
