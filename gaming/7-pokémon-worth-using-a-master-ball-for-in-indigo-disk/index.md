## Literature Review

With a new abundance of Master Balls in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you can use the rare Poké Balls on multiple creatures.




Using the Master Ball on some Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet can be a great way of ensuring their capture without much effort. The Master Ball is a classic item that makes its return in the second part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack for the first Gen 9 games. It has a 100% guaranteed catch rate, which means that no Pokémon can escape it. This item is often used on Legendary creatures that are usually the more troublesome ones to capture with their lower catch rates. The problem is that Master Balls tend to be limited.
There is a Pokémon Indigo Disk trick for infinite Master Balls, but even so, they still are hard to come by, even if they can be consistently obtained. Because of their rarity, choosing when to use a Master Ball is always a tough moment, as using it on one Pokémon may make some future encounters a little bit harder to get through. Nevertheless, there are some creatures that are worth the usage of a Master Ball, even if players already have a 100% guaranteed catch rate. The design of the Master Ball gives the captured Pokémon an exclusive house to dwell in, outside the more popular types of Poké Balls.









 








 7  Iron Boulder 
Type: Rock- and Psychic-type
        

Although it is the least impressive of the new Paradox Pokémon added with the Indigo Disk DLC, the Violet-exclusive Iron Boulder is one of the creatures that deserves a Master Ball. While it is not a Legendary creature per si, it does get that treatment in the game. Only one Iron Boulder can be obtained per save file and players first have to unlock the battle and then locate the creature’s static encounter in Area Zero.
It does not have a very low catch rate and it is fairly easy to catch it with either a Quick Ball at the start of the battle or with an Ultra Ball through the traditional weakening method. Nevertheless, a Master Ball is fitting for Iron Boulder, which is one of the rarest creatures in the entire Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Putting it inside the rare type of Poké Ball gives it an extra reputation when trading.





 6  Iron Crown 
Type: Steel- and Psychic-type


 







Iron Crown, the future form of Cobalion, is much more impressive as a Paradox Pokémon than Iron Boulder. Even though future Paradox Pokémon are somewhat lackluster in comparison to Ancient Paradox creatures, Iron Crown is one of the most appealing ones, deserving of a Master Ball. With its signature Tachyon Cutter move and great Steel- and Psychic-type combination, Iron Crown is the best of the two Violet-exclusive Paradox Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC.
Like Iron Boulder, Iron Crown is given the Legendary treatment, despite not being categorized in such a way. In order to find and catch Iron Crown in Pokémon Indigo Disk, players have to complete certain tasks and then uncover its hidden location in Area Zero. This creature is not too hard to catch, but using a Master Ball on it is a great way of showcasing its extravagant value and rarity.





 5  Gouging Fire 
Type: Fire- and Dragon-type
        

Although its appearance can seem somewhat fazing at first, Gouging Fire is one of the best-looking new creatures available in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC’s Blueberry Pokédex. The ancient Paradox form of Entei, Gouging Fire takes on the Fire- and Dragon-type combination, as it essentially represents a dinosaur – to be more specific, it has elements that resemble that of a triceratops, for instance.
Its elongated cloud-like tail gives it a more elegant design, which serves as a balancing point for the massive horns on its head. Gouging Fire is a Scarlet-exclusive creature and like the new Violet-exclusive Paradox Pokémon in Indigo Disk, there is only one encounter with it per save file. Considering its looks, gameplay value as a creature with high stats, and the Legendary treatment it is given, Gouging Fire is worthy of a Master Ball catch, even if it is easily catchable with other types of Poké Balls.





 4  Raging Bolt 
Type: Electric- and Dragon-type


 







The Scarlet-exclusive counterpart to Violet’s Iron Crown is Raging Bolt, and this is the best new Paradox Pokémon added with the Indigo Disk DLC. The Ancient Paradox form of Raikou boasts an immense elongated neck that resembles that of a brachiosaurus. In addition to that, its mane wraps around its head and looks as if it were a thundercloud protecting Raging Bolt’s head. In comparison to Raikou itself, Raging Bolt’s design is quite shocking, but quickly settles in as one of the coolest-looking Paradox Pokémon so far.
Much like Iron Crown and the other aforementioned Paradox creatures, Raging Bolt is given the Legendary treatment. As such, to find and catch Raging Bolt in Pokémon Indigo Disk, players have to unlock its battle by completing a side quest, and then proceeding to locate it hidden in Area Zero. Its solid Electric- and Dragon-type typing along with its excentric design and overall rarity justify the usage of a Master Ball on Raging Bolt, even if it is easily catchable through ordinary means.





 3  Lugia 
Type: Psychic- and Flying-type
        

Although Lugia is one of the many returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC, it is also one of the most popular and has a reliable gameplay value. The Gen 2 sea monster from the region of Johto can be obtained by talking to Snacksworth after completing 1 group Blueberry Quest in Pokémon Scarlet or 10 solo Blueberry Quests in Pokémon Violet. The order he gives out treats is random, so obtaining the Lugia treat may take a while.
Regardless, Lugia is a fan-favorite Legendary, and, considering the trouble players have to go through to unlock it, this is one creature that is worthy of a Master Ball in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Surely, players can capture it through traditional means, but this is a tanky Pokémon that can pose quite a challenge when compared to other scrawny Legendaries that made their way into Gen 9 with the expansion.





 2  Meloetta 
Type: Normal- and Psychic-type (Aria Form) and Normal- and Fighting-type (Pirouette Form)
        

The Gen 5 Mythical Pokémon Meloetta was not advertised as a returning creature in the expansion, but it is there. Players have to complete a secret ritual in order to find Meloetta in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. Then, they can start the encounter with it. It is not terribly difficult to catch Meloetta, but given its Mythical status, it is well-deserving of a Master Ball to further showcase its value.
In addition to that, the secret ritual to unlock the encounter alone is special enough to justify the usage of such a rare type of Poké Ball. Mythical Pokémon like Meloetta are hard to come by naturally in the core games and are often locked behind promotional events. As such, being sure to obtain it without the risk of failing is recommended, and that’s where the Master Ball in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC comes in.





 1  Terapagos 
Type: Normal-type


 







The hidden Legendary mascot for Pokémon Indigo Disk, Terapagos, is one of the most coveted creatures in the DLC. It can only be captured once per save file and is exclusively tied in with the campaign, so players have to progress through the story and go through a long Tera battle in order to catch it. There is a catch, however: Terapagos’ catch is already guaranteed. This allows players to encase Terapagos in whatever type of Poké Ball they prefer.
While it is technically a waste to use a rare Master Ball on Terapagos, this is a chance for players to make a petty gesture against their rival, Kieran. The young boy tried to catch Terapagos with a Master Ball and the Legendary creature destroyed his special Poké Ball. By using their own Master Ball to catch Terapagos, players can show Kieran who is the best, even if that goes unacknowledged in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
