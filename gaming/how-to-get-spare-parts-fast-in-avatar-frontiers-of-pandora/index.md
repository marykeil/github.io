## Literature Review

If you plan on taking advantage of the special ammo types in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, then you&#39;ll need all the Spare Parts you can get.





One of the best beginner tips for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is to search for spare parts right away. This is the quickest way to improve your equipment in the game&#39;s early stages. Simultaneously, you&#39;ll want to stockpile Spare Parts for the late game to rely on those special ammo types when you need them most. Whatever your purpose with them is, if you want to amass a lot of spare parts, you&#39;ll need to get your hands dirty.




                  &#34;A Staggering Sensory Experience&#34; - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.   


 Fastest Way To Get Spare Parts In Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora 
          

You will get Spare Parts in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as a reward for completing main missions and side quests. Human-related side quests usually reward you with them as they are RDA-based material. However, because Spare Parts come from the RDA, that&#39;s also who you need to hunt down to get your hands on them.

Therefore, you can find Spare Parts at RDA facilities, camps, and outposts scattered throughout the world. And thanks to the map size in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, there is no shortage of them either. Within these encampments, you will find yellow chests (as seen above) containing Spare Parts. Therefore, exploring the world, raiding, and clearing out RDA settlements is the best and fastest way to get Spare Parts, but it is not the only way.






You will get even more Spare Parts from the chest if you don&#39;t alarm the outposts; in other words, go into these camps and carry out your mission with stealth.




Removing RDA Dart From Creatures
You can also get Spare Parts by removing RDA tracking darts that have been lodged in some of Pandora&#39;s animals. You can tell these animals apart by their obvious limping, hearing a pinging noise from the dart, or seeing the dart highlighted with your Na&#39;vi Sense.

Once you&#39;ve encountered a creature with a dart stuck in it, you must approach slowly and carefully until you receive an on-screen prompt to soothe the animal. Hold this action and continue moving slowly towards it. If done correctly, you should get a cutscene where you pull the RDA dart out of the creature, and it flees. You will receive a few Spare Parts as a reward, which may not seem like much, but every bit counts.



 Where To Trade Spare Parts In Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora 
          




Spare Parts can be exchanged for weapons, armor, and mods with Hurit Ahenakew and Rajinder Singh Grewal at the Resistance Headquarters. Both characters serve as merchants, bartering their weapons and armor for Spare Parts. Additionally, you can use Spare Parts to craft special ammo for some of your guns, such as the Longbow, Staff Sling, and Spear Thrower. However, crafting this special ammo requires much more than just Spare Parts, so fill your pockets with everything you come across in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
