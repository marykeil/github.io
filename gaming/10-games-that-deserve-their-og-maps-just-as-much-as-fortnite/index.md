## Literature Review

Fortnite saw a player boom with the reintroduction of an iconic map. Some other franchises could see a similar boost with the return of classic maps.




For a few years, there has been speculation that Fortnite will bring back its original map; however, it was not until 2023 and the release of Fortnite’s Season OG that the original map returned. Though this may be insignificant to some players, many were overjoyed by the return of the game&#39;s most iconic map - as easily shown by the record-breaking 44 million players that returned to the original experience.
Owing to the extraordinary boom in Fortnite&#39;s player population, it&#39;s possible other developers are tempted to revive the iconic maps from their previous projects. While this may not affect the number of players for many games, for others, the prospect of the reintroduction of classic maps is a tantalizing prospect to people. Although an increase of tens of millions of players is unlikely for any game, some all-but-forgotten franchises that trade on the legacies of their older and better games may rise to glory again with the introduction of classic maps.

 10  Overwatch (2016) 
Temple of Anubis
        

  Overwatch  


  Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , PC     Released    May 24, 2016     Developer(s)    Blizzard Entertainment     Genre(s)    Shooter    


Since its release in 2016, Overwatch has been praised for its diverse collection of game modes, characters, and maps - many of which thoroughly deserve to make an appearance in future games in the series or in a dedicated Overwatch remake. While maps such as King&#39;s Row are undeniable highlights, the removal of beloved assault maps like Hanamura and Temple of Anubis are clear exclusions to diehard fans of the first title. Bold, colorful, and generally aesthetically beautiful, some of the best Overwatch maps are timeless and would undoubtedly fit in well with the maps currently in Overwatch 2 or in any future games the series may bring.





 9  Battlefield 4 (2013) 
Operation Metro, Golmud Railway, Operation Outbreak
        

The first-person shooter series Battlefield has a well-deserved place among the pantheon of the most important and generally most enjoyable games in the genre. Though Battlefield 4 was criticized by many for its single-player modes, it was nearly universally lauded for its multiplayer modes and its many maps. Though the most recent game in the franchise, Battlefield 2042, was released to mixed reviews from critics and a great amount of negative feedback from players, one way this seemingly irredeemable game could be saved is through the release of multiplayer map packs featuring many maps from earlier games, especially Battlefield 4.





 8  Rust (2013) 
Hapis Island
        

  Rust  


  Platform(s)    macOS , PC , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    February 8, 2018     Developer(s)    Facepunch Studios     Genre(s)    Survival , Shooter    


Developed by Facepunch Studios and released in 2013, Rust is a multiplayer survival game that is undeniably one of the best survival games to be released in the late 2010s. The game, perhaps best described as DayZ meets Minecraft, typically has procedurally generated maps, but Hapis Island was a pre-created map that endured for 10 years before being retired in 2023. Though Facepunch Studios founder Garry Newman has hinted at a sequel, little has been revealed regarding Rust&#39;s future. If a Rust sequel is in the works, fans of the game can only hope that Hapis makes a return.





 7  Call Of Duty: World At War (2008) 
Castle, Cliffside, Revolution
        

Quite possibly one of the all-time best games from the enduringly popular Call of Duty franchise, Call of Duty: World at War, took the series back to its roots in the setting of the Second World War. Critically and commercially acclaimed, World at War&#39;s maps have yet to be surpassed by any Second World War-orientated Call of Duty game. As a result, if the franchise returns to this powerful fountain of influence yet again, it certainly should revive some of the better maps from World at War. This could certainly have helped Call of Duty: Vanguard; however, that installment was one of the most disappointing live-service games of all time.





 6  Unreal Tournament (1999) 
Boomerang, Castle Von Fistch, Diamond Sword
        

Released in 1999, Unreal Tournament has developed a reputation as a classic of the first-person arena shooter video game genre. Though the latest release in the Unreal franchise came in 2013 with Unreal Tournament 3, no game in the series came close to the quality of maps that the Unreal Tournament possessed. Though a 2014 project was canceled, and little news has emerged since, fans of the game can only hope that it is, one day, revived. With highlights including Boomerang, Castle Von Fistch, and Diamond Sword, Unreal Tournament&#39;s maps are some of the most inventive and exciting in the first-person shooter genre, a deeply impressive feat considering its age.





 5  Team Fortress 2 (2007) 
Doomsday
        

  Team Fortress 2  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360     Released    January 1, 2007     Developer(s)    Valve     Genre(s)    First-Person Shooter    


Though Team Fortress 2 has developed a reputation as excellent meme fodder, it is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games ever created. Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. Like many multiplayer first-person shooters, Team Fortress 2 has a vast and varied supply of maps, and while they aren&#39;t all universally outstanding, some, such as Hydro and Landfall, are artistically, aesthetically, and generally incredible. Doomsday is one such map that isn&#39;t officially canceled, but one will have a hard time finding a server that hosts it.





 4  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) 
Crash, Shipment, Vacant
        

The fourth mainline Call of Duty title, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is an exceptional first-person shooter game that took the stagnating franchise out of the trenches and brought it into the modern era. Though praised for its single-player campaign, the highlight of Modern Warfare comes with its multiplayer modes. While engaging and entertaining, one of the best parts of Modern Warfare&#39;s multiplayer is the maps. With excellent options such as Crash, Shipment, Vacant, and the constantly re-released Nuketown, Modern Warfare has one of the best and most varied sets of maps of all the Call of Duty games.

 3  Battlefield 3 (2011) 
Caspian Border, Grand Bazaar, Noshahr Canals


 







Though the Battlefield series is expansive and features a number of great games, especially early on, arguably the best game in the franchise is Battlefield 3. Though limited to nine multiplayer maps, the developers of Battlefield 3, DICE, obviously elected to value quality over quantity, as every single map in the game is extraordinary. Deeply detailed, massive, and aesthetically impressive, Battlefield 3&#39;s maps certainly deserve to be repurposed in map packs for the latest and any future installments of the Battlefield series. Bringing back any of Battlefield 3&#39;s maps to Battlefield 2042 would absolutely help increase the number of players - as happened when Fortnite brought back its original map.





 2  Call Of Duty: Black Ops (2010) 
Firing Range, Summit, Berlin Wall


 







Released in 2010, Call of Duty: Black Ops, ushered in the start of a new subseries of Call of Duty games, the Cold War-focused Black Ops series that was most recently revived in 2020 with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Though the Black Ops games typically feature a good selection of excellent maps, none have surpassed the original. With maps such as Firing Range, Summit, and Berlin Wall, Black Ops offers players countless hours of excitement and entertainment - opportunities that the most recent games in the Call of Duty franchise are notably lacking. Perhaps the reissuing of some of these classic maps could reinvigorate the classic series.





 1  Halo 3 (2007) 
Valhalla, Guardian, The Pit


 







  Halo 3  


  Franchise    Halo     Platform(s)    Xbox One , Xbox 360 , PC     Released    September 25, 2007     Developer(s)    Bungie     Genre(s)    Action    


Though later games in the Halo series pay homage to the outstanding first three entries, they seemingly always fail to recapture even a modicum of what made Halo great. Although a heavily debated topic, possibly the best Halo installment came in 2007 with Halo 3. With an excellent story and an equally amazing multiplayer mode, Halo 3 has some of the best maps of any first-person shooter game ever released. Though particular highlights include Valhalla, Guardian, and The Pit, any map in this game will offer an outstanding experience. Bringing back these incredible multiplayer maps to the Halo franchise would go a long way toward helping inspire a Fortnite-esque revival.
               Fortnite   Released:   2017-07-21    Genre(s):   Action, War    ESRB:   T    Platform(s):   PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, iOS, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch    Developer(s):   Epic Games    Publisher(s):   Epic Games, Warner Bros. Games    How Long To Beat:   64 Hours
