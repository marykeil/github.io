# Indigo Disk DLC May Have Extra Paradox Pokémon, But There s Bad News


## SUMMARY 



  Leaks suggest that two more Paradox Pokémon, Paradox Entei and Paradox Terrakion, will be released in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, completing their respective Legendary Trios.   The release method for these two Pokémon is uncertain, but it is likely that they will be distributed through a special event rather than as part of The Indigo Disk DLC.   Obtaining these Paradox Pokémon may be time-consuming and require luck, as they could be made available through limited-time Tera Raid Battles, similar to previous distributions.

## Literature Review

Leaks are indicating that an additional two Paradox Pokémon will be coming to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but there is a downside to the news.




Leaks are indicating that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will feature more Paradox Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC than have currently been announced, but this comes with a downside. Paradox Pokémon are one of the unique features of the Gen 9 games. Although any additions to their number are certainly welcomed, it is the circumstances through which they are obtained that may begin to pose problems for some.




There are still mysteries surrounding the true origins of Paradox Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but it seems increasingly clear that there is a connection to Area Zero and the Legendary Pokémon Terapagos. As a result, it is somewhat expected for a new revelation about Paradox Pokémon to be part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero’s second half when The Indigo Disk is released later this year. New Paradox Pokémon have also been announced in the form of Raging Bolt and Iron Crown, new versions of Raikou and Cobalion to complement the earlier distributions of Walking Wake and Iron Leaves in limited-time Tera Raid Battles.

                  Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC - Release Date, New Pokémon, Price, &amp; Story   New information about Scarlet and Violet’s second DLC, The Indigo Disk, has been revealed, including new Pokémon, story details, and more.   


 Indigo Disk Leaks Suggest Extra Legendary Paradox Pokémon Are Coming 
          




Leaks from reputable sources have indicated that two more Paradox Pokémon will be released at some point in the future, with the notable leaker Centro Leaks describing a ‘Paradox Entei’ and ‘Paradox Terrakion’ among other future additions to the franchise. These Pokémon would complete their respective Legendary Trios, and while officially unconfirmed, logically speaking, their existence seems effectively certain. However, the fact that these two Pokémon have yet to be revealed or advertised in any way suggests that they will not be part of The Indigo Disk DLC like Raging Bolt and Iron Crown. Instead, they may be intended to be distributed through a special event.



Given their predecessors’ designs, this new version of Entei is presumably a dinosaur-like Ancient Paradox Pokémon, while the Terrakion variant is a robotic Future Paradox.




Releasing additional Paradox Pokémon for The Indigo Disk would help to greatly extend the lifetime of the DLC and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as a whole, especially when combined with other special events such as themed online tournaments or special Tera Raids. Nevertheless, having Paradox Entei and Terrakion be distributed through one such event means that they will likely be available for a limited time only, much like Walking Wake and Iron Leaves were. This means that in the future, the two Paradox Pokémon will likely become increasingly difficult to obtain without people resorting to cheating by hacking illegitimate copies into a game.





 

It is an unfortunate consequence of having especially distributed Event Pokémon that people who begin playing after the original distribution has ended may never obtain them. But in the case of Paradox Pokémon, which are intimately connected to Gen 9, this is an even more prominent problem. Unlike more generic Legendary or Mythical Pokémon, which are easily justifiable in having future appearances in other Pokémon games, it seems far less natural for Paradox Pokémon to make a return without new games set in Paldea. And as the Gen 10 Pokémon games are far more likely to be set in a new region instead, this may be a long time away.



 Catching Paradox Entei &amp; Paradox Terrakion May Be Time-Consuming 
          




It is worth noting that there are several potential methods through which Paradox Entei and Terrakion may be released, all of which could leave people waiting for a long time to obtain them. Much like Walking Wake and Iron Leaves, they could easily become the focus of a limited-time Tera Raid Battle. This in itself has its downsides, as event raids such as these can be very difficult to complete, at times requiring a perfect lineup of Pokémon with an established strategy to battle with. This in turn requires people to learn and spread effective strategies for online play, and less informed or unprepared people can easily disrupt such plans.

This means that while it would be possible to obtain both of these Paradox Pokémon without the need to trade, doing so could still require a large amount of time and luck. Of course, this could make doing so a significant commitment, consequently limiting the number of Paradoxes that are successfully captured. This is a very unfortunate possibility, but a likely scenario for some people. Moreover, given that this was the method through which Walking Wake and Iron Leaves were distributed (excluding any different plans for a potential future re-release), along with other special Pokémon like Mewtwo, it is by far the most likely scenario for Paradox Entei and Terrakion.




                  We Probably Already Know The BB League Champion In Pokémon’s Indigo Disk DLC     examination of the trailers for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC suggests a familiar face is likely Champion of the BB League.    



 Leaked Paradox Pokémon Could Be Easier To Catch Than Their Predecessors 
         

Of course, it is still possible that these two Paradox Legendaries could instead be released as more traditional Mystery Gifts, either as an in-person promotional event with selected stores or a simple online code distribution. This would make it far easier to obtain these two Pokémon and would undoubtedly be the preferable way to do so if they are not simply part of the DLC themselves. But given the prevalence of Tera Raid battles being used for distribution in Scarlet and Violet, this more convenient option, unfortunately, does not seem to be the most probable one for such a major event.




Almost certainly among the various new Pokémon coming in The Indigo Disk, these new Paradox Pokémon have been heavily rumored and leaked but not officially confirmed. Nevertheless, simple logic alone is enough to indicate the existence of Paradox Entei and Terrakion to match the other additional Paradoxes that have been revealed. This alone is an exciting prospect, but the potentially long wait to distribution for these two Legendary Paradoxes is less appealing. Similarly, the likely usage of Tera Raid Battles could make these Pokémon frustratingly hard to obtain, although it will at least also guarantee people will be spending much more time in the world of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
