## Literature Review

The phrase &#34;Akimbo&#34; refers to dual wielding weapons in Modern Warfare 3, a skill you can unlock and use by leveling up guns for the right attachment.





Several weapons have the Akimbo Perk as part of their leveled progression as a loadout ability you can equip before queuing for an online match. This is different from carrying two primary weapons in Modern Warfare 3, with the Perk duplicating a pre-existing firearm instead. Every Handgun has the Akimbo Perk, which is the ideal gun to consider when trying to take advantage of this trait.

There are ten guns with the Akimbo Perk, each with its prerequisites to get the dual-wielding feature. These secondary weapons must be used in multiplayer if you want to level them up by doing well in matches and earning killstreaks.
