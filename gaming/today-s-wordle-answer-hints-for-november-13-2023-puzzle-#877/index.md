## Literature Review

The new Wordle for Monday is a fairly simple one. If you need a little help though, we&#39;ve got the hints, and fully spoiled answer, for today&#39;s Wordle.





There are multiple ways to increase the challenge of Wordle, one of the easiest ones is Wordle&#39;s Hard Mode which can be activated through the options menu. This will &#34;lock in&#34; clues given from past guesses which stop players from using word combos to help solve the game. This is also a great way to lower your guess count on any given day.

The November 13th Wordle answer is GREEN.

Certainly not a difficult word for a Monday. Our starting Wordle word was POUND which only provided a misplaced &#39;N&#39; and not much else. Moving forward we tried RANCH as our second guess and this added in a new misplaced letter and another incorrect spot for the &#39;N&#39;.

Knowing we hadn&#39;t gotten a vowel correct yet we tried out NEWER to test the &#39;E&#39; and it gave us the biggest clue of all, a repeating vowel. This easily led us to a Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer and Kermit the Frog&#39;s favorite color, GREEN.
