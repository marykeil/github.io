## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 developer, Insomniac is producing a game starring Wolverine; though this is great, a few other superheroes deserve this honor.




With Insomniac Games, the developer of the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series of games going on to create a video game starting Wolverine, Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, a question emerges regarding which other Marvel superheroes deserve their own game. Despite producing enormously popular comics, movies, and TV shows, Marvel has arguably only reached its video game peak fairly recently. While many of Marvel&#39;s most notable figures have been the leading characters in video games, only a select few of the adaptations of the comic book giant&#39;s franchises come even remotely close to the quality of gameplay or storytelling that the most recent series of Spider-Man games possess.




The most recent Insomniac release, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, has been met with commercial success and critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it to be the best PS5 exclusive yet to be released; it is hoped by many fans of the Wolverine franchise, that this exemplary quality will translate with a more mature source material. Though Marvel aficionados have Marvel&#39;s Wolverine to look forward to, the sheer number of excellent candidates for future releases is astounding - some of whom have either not had a starring role in a video game in years, or have never had a dedicated video game at all.

                  10 Marvel Heroes To Include In Spider-Man 2 DLC   Any upcoming DLC for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 should include some big names, fan-favorites, and familiar faces that Insomniac has not introduced yet.   


 Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers) 
Previous Games: Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order (2019), Lego Marvel Superheroes 2 (2017), Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite (2017)
          




Carol Danvers, also known as Captain Marvel, has never had a video game release focusing on her - an enormous missed opportunity as she is one of Marvel&#39;s most famous and powerful female heroes. Though Captain Marvel has been included in a number of video games, such as 2017&#39;s Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, her inclusion in a larger cast of heroes has always come across as an afterthought. Captain Marvel has had two dedicated movies, Captain Marvel (2019) and The Marvels (2023), and plays a recurring role in other Marvel Cinematic Universe projects; however, this vital figure is yet to have a video game.



 Iron Man (Tony Stark) 
Previous Games: Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal (1994)
          

Iron Man can quite reasonably be circled out as the architect of Marvel&#39;s late 2000s boom in popularity. This genius, witty, and charismatic figure has starred in numerous blockbuster films, but when it comes to video games, his are often abysmal. Iron Man is undoubtedly an excellent candidate for a future video game, not as an Avenger, but as an individual superhero, in a manner similar to the earliest Robert Downy Jr. movies. The variety of his suits, abilities, and powers could even exceed those of Miles Morales and Peter Park in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Plus, with a large roster of enemies, the options for a game&#39;s story are limitless. Luckily, Motive Studio has an Iron Man game in early development, though there&#39;s been no word since its initial announcement.






 Captain America (Steve Rogers) 
Previous Games: Captain America: Super Soldier (2011), Marvel&#39;s Avengers (2020), Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage (1994)
          

While Captain America may have originated as a 1940s jingoistic supersoldier, he has become one of Marvel&#39;s most enduringly popular superheroes. Owing to this popularity, and his combination of interesting abilities and backstory, a new Captain America game could be incredibly fun. An obvious choice of setting is already being used for a Captain America and Black Panther World War 2 game; however, having appeared in over ten thousand stories, there is sure to be an original way to bring Captain America to video games in a new and unique way. An icon of American popular culture, Captain America undoubtedly deserves a new video game.



 Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) 
Previous Games: Ghost Rider (2007), Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite (2017), Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order (2019)
          




Famously portrayed by Nick Cage, Ghost Rider did have a game release to coincide with the 2007 movie release; however, it received fiarly poor reviews from critics. Though it has been a while since the Ghost Rider movie fame heyday, this Phantom Rider retains his appeal and popularity. Stuntman Johnny Blaze by day, fiery supernatural motorcyclist by night, Ghost Rider is simply incredibly cool. Beyond his status as a fan favorite, Ghost Rider would be perfectly suited to an Insomniac-produced video game - while he can&#39;t swing from a web like Spider-Man, the option to speed through a city on his hellish motorbike while fighting crime would be awesome.



 Black Panther (T&#39;Challa) 
Previous Games: Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order (2019), Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite (2017), Lego Marvel Superheroes 2 (2017)
          

Though Black Panther is yet to have a game released that sees him as the undisputed main hero, an untitled Captain America and Black Panther video game is in production by the as-yet-unproven developer, Skydance New Media. Though it is not clear if this will be a Captain America-centric game or one with an equal division of screen time, Black Panther is undoubtedly one of Marvel&#39;s superheroes most deserving of a video game. The first protagonist of African descent in a Marvel comic, Black Panther is an iconic figure, a status well deserved, and only heightened by the excellent series of Black Panther movies, originally starring the late Chadwick Boseman.




                  Uncharted Creator&#39;s Marvel Game Stars Black Panther &amp; Cap, Says Leak [UPDATED]   Fresh leaks claim that former Uncharted director Amy Hennig&#39;s new Marvel game is about Captain America &amp; Black Panther taking on Hydra in World War 2.   



 Blade (Frank Blade/Eric Cross Brooks) 
Previous Games: Blade (2000), Blade 2 (2002)
          

Blade, a dhampir and vampire hunter, is best known as the titular anti-hero in a franchise of cult-favorite movies. With an upcoming standalone film projected for 2025, now would be the perfect time for Marvel to release a video game adaptation starring this slayer of the undead. While the first two movies of the Wesley Snipes trilogy received the early 2000s movie video game treatment, Blade is yet to have a starring role in an exceptional video game, despite the fact he certainly deserves one. Fighting powerful vampires at night in a fictionalized Los Angeles while employing a mastery of martial arts and swords could make for an excellent game.






 Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) 
Previous Games: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man (2018), Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 (2023), Spider-Man (2000)
          

Black Cat, as an on-again-off-again enemy, lover, and ally of Spider-Man has found herself frequently in his cultural shadow. Although the majority of her video game features have come in Spider-Man games, such as the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series in which she occasionally plays a part, Black Cat is an endearing, entertaining, and generally interesting character that has the skillset and mass market appeal to justify a leading role in her own game. Though probably unlikely, a Black Cat video game would be amazing. It could see her conflicted between life as a hero and as a villain, and it could also provide an alternative perspective on her relationship with Spider-Man.



 Deadpool (Wade Wilson) 
Previous Games: Deadpool (2013), Marvel Contest of Champions (2014), Lego Marvel Superheroes (2013)
         




Though Deadpool has always been popular, Ryan Reynolds&#39; portrayal of Wade Wilson has given him a newfound degree of name recognition that few Marvel characters, outside the Avengers, ever achieve. Deadpool has featured in numerous games and has even starred in one; however, Marvel needs to do justice to this regenerating degenerate and give him a new game, not a poorly conceived movie tie-in like 2013&#39;s Deadpool, but an original story with gameplay on par with Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. While it would likely not be as child-friendly as Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, it would be incredibly funny, brutal, and could open the doors for the adaptations of other mature audience superheroes.



 Punisher (Francis Castle) 
Previous Games: The Punisher (1993), The Punisher (2005), The Punisher: No Mercy (2009)
         

A quintessential antihero, Punisher, began his comic book career as an adversary of Spider-Man but has gone on to use his often violent methods for good. Driven by a tragic backstory, Punisher, unlike many superheroes, isn&#39;t afraid of causing irreversible damage to his enemies. Perhaps more a vigilante than a superhero, Punisher&#39;s outfit consists of a black and white skull imprinted shirt with combat trousers, rather than a mask, cape, or any other article of stereotypical superhero costume. A new Punisher game would be a huge divergence from Marvel&#39;s typical games; however, it would undeniably be fun to go from Spider-Man&#39;s refusal to inflict excessive damage to Punisher&#39;s sadistic methods.






 Daredevil (Matthew Michael Murdock) 
Previous Games: Daredevil (2003), Lego Marvel Superheroes (2013), Marvel Heroes (2015)
         

There are a number of rumors circulating regarding Daredevil featuring in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC, or in a subsequent game; while this would be entertaining, the Devil of Hell&#39;s Kitchen is without question, deserving of his own Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man-esque game. A man without fear, Daredevil, has starred in a number of movies, but his sole appearance as a game&#39;s leading character was a poorly received movie-tie-in flop. Despite this, his upcoming Disney&#43; show, Daredevil: Born Again (2024), shows just how willing Marvel is to invest in the character. Visually awesome, an incredible story, and generally very cool, Daredevil, is one Marvel superhero who deserves his own game after Marvel&#39;s Wolverine.

               Marvel&#39;s Wolverine   Released:   2050-01-01    Developer(s):   Insomniac Games    Genre(s):   Adventure, Action    Platform(s):   PlayStation 5    Publisher(s):   Sony Interactive Entertainment    ESRB:   Not Yet Rated    Franchise:   Marvel, Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe    Summary:   Marvel&#39;s Wolverine is the next entry in Insomniac Games&#39; cultivated Marvel universe after Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Miles Morales. Players will sharpen their claws and step into the world of the short-tempered, regenerative Logan in an unknown storyline. No rating or details have been revealed for the game. However, Insomniac&#39;s development team has teased that Marvel&#39;s Wolverine will have the visceral action fans have come to expect of the hero.
