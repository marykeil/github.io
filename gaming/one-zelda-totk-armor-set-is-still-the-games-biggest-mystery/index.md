# One Zelda TOTK Armor Set Is Still The Games Biggest Mystery


## SUMMARY 



  The Ancient Hero&#39;s Aspect armor in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom holds unanswered mysteries that could change the understanding of the game and the Zelda franchise.   The armor&#39;s design suggests a connection to the extinct Zonai race, but certain features like a tail and green skin resemble the Gerudo, particularly Ganondorf and Twinrova.   It is speculated that the Ancient Hero may be related to Koume and Kotake, potentially as a failed attempt at resurrecting Ganondorf, or as an instrument of revenge against Hyrule by Twinrova using Zonai DNA. The full explanation remains uncertain.

## Literature Review

Amongst the many pieces of armor available to find in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, one poses the game’s biggest mystery of all.




The world of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom poses several unanswered mysteries, perhaps the biggest of which revolves around a powerful set of armor. The lore surrounding some of TOTK’s armor sets can pose significant questions, especially as the details regarding these sets&#39; origins can often be vague or incomplete. Nevertheless, it is clear that one set, if its full background is uncovered, could radically change the current understanding of TOTK and the Zelda franchise.




As no DLC that could expand on Tears of the Kingdom is being developed, some parts of the game seem to have been left unresolved or unfinished. For example, Kass&#39;s absence after Breath of the Wild is given no explanation, even when he is directly referenced at the end of Penn’s own storyline. On the other hand, it is important to note that clarification can, and has, been given in external material such as interviews regarding some of Hyrule’s mysteries, and so additional information could emerge at any time regarding the game’s other puzzling aspects.

                  One Zelda: TOTK Temple Proves Why Tears of the Kingdom DLC Was Needed   A certain Temple in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom demonstrates one of the game’s biggest flaws, which DLC could have easily resolved   


 The Ancient Hero’s Aspect Poses TOTK’s Biggest Mystery 
          




The Ancient Hero’s Aspect is one of TOTK’s best armor sets and is the reward for completing all 152 shrines in the game. Wearing it seems to grant Link the appearance of the Ancient Hero who originally faced Calamity Ganon, given the resemblance to Impa’s ancient tapestry. However, the design of the Ancient Hero itself is remarkably bizarre, to the point of not belonging to any known Hyrulean race. One leading theory is that the Ancient Hero was actually a Zonai-Hylian hybrid, which could explain the shape of his large, pointed ears and snout-like face. Similarly, the Ancient Hero’s clothing is clearly Zonai, indicating a connection to the extinct race.

On the other hand, some aspects of the Ancient Hero’s design don&#39;t seem to fit Zonai or Hylian features. These include the presence of a tail with a tuft of red hair at the end. Neither Rauru nor Mineru can be seen to have a tail in TOTK, and Hylians certainly lack such a feature, making it unclear how a descendant of either race, let alone both, could have one. In addition, the Ancient Hero has green skin, a trait more associated with the Gerudo, more specifically, Ganondorf and Twinrova. Notably, the fact that the Ancient Hero also has red hair seems to reinforce this connection.





 



 The Ancient Hero Could Be   To The Gerudo 
          

Assuming that this resemblance is not simply coincidence, and with Ganondorf having been defeated and sealed in the Imprisoning War, it seems likely that the Ancient Hero is related to Koume and Kotake. This could be due to him being a descendant of the pair in some way. Of course, this does require ignoring the established rarity of Gerudo males to some extent, but it would also give a broader significance to the pair’s cameo appearance in TOTK.

                  Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom’s Ending Puts Riju In Big Trouble   There are a few constants in the Gerudo lore across games, and Riju could be in big trouble because of them after the events of Zelda: TOTK.   




Given Twinrova’s overarching resurrection plot in the two Oracle games, one interesting possibility that arises from their potential involvement here is that the Ancient Hero could be an incredibly backfired attempt at reviving Ganondorf. His adoptive mothers, who perhaps didn’t realize Ganondorf wasn&#39;t entirely dead as a result of Rauru’s seal, could have attempted to bring him back through dark magic. Instead, it is easy to see such a plan accidentally creating a new life or even incarnating a version of Link through his and Ganon’s connection with the Curse of Demise. In this scenario, the Ancient Hero’s tail could be an echo of the bestial Ganon’s own limb.



The Linked Game ending of the Oracle games sees a mindless Ganon be resurrected by Twinrova as the result of a semi-successful ritual.






 The Ancient Hero’s Aspect Could Be Proof Of An Old Plot Against Hyrule 
         




Given that the Ancient Hero does resemble the Zonai in some respects, this could be intended as a way to strengthen this new incarnation of Ganon by his mothers, by taking on aspects of the Zoani who defeated him. A similar possibility is that Twinrova created or conceived the Ancient Hero using Zonai DNA, or at least a magical equivalent, in order for him to be an instrument of revenge against the young Kingdom of Hyrule. Of course, it is abundantly clear that the Ancient Hero ultimately fought for the kingdom instead of against it, meaning that he rebelled against any devious plots involved in his origins.

                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   

Of course, without some sort of prequel game to TOTK, it is uncertain if there will ever be a full explanation for the Ancient Hero and his appearance, let alone how The Ancient Hero’s Aspect itself came to be created. Nevertheless, a scenario like this is certainly intriguing and explains some of the Ancient Hero’s stranger design points. Narratively, it would also be entertainingly and immensely ironic for an intended resurrection of Ganondorf to be instrumental in his defeat when he first emerged as Calamity Ganon.




                  Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ending Explained (In Detail)   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is finally out, and its main campaign can be finished. Here are all the details regarding the game’s ending, explained.   

The Ancient Hero belongs to a race not seen elsewhere in The Legend of Zelda, a fact that has prompted widespread speculation. His clothing implies a connection to the Zonai, and the visible similarity to Impa’s tapestry is clearly not coincidental, but otherwise, there is very little known about him. On the other hand, his partial resemblance to the most villainous members of the Gerudo offers some interesting possibilities regarding his origins. In the end, The Ancient Hero’s Aspect armor introduces many more questions than it does answers in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and exploring these mysteries could have an impressive impact on the next title.
