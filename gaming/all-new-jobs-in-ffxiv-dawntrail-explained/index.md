## Literature Review

Square Enix has confirmed two new Jobs arriving in the Dawntrail expansion for FFXIV. Here’s everything about each of these new DPS classes.




There are new jobs being added to Final Fantasy XIV with the introduction of the Dawntrail expansion, expected to arrive in mid-2024. The fifth expansion to the world of the popular MMORPG will continue the story of the Warrior of Light and their allies after the conclusion of the Light and Darkness saga that occurred during the story of Endwalker. Instead of fighting a life-menacing threat, however, players will embark on something of a summertime vacation in the previously unexplored region of Tural. There, they will partake in a ceremonial contest that will determine the new leader of the region.




This will all be set on new maps, that will be open for players to explore freely. Dawntrail’s setting in FFXIV is mostly based on prehispanic civilizations and locations in the Americas. There, for instance, lush jungle areas and swamps, as well as tall mountain ranges that resemble the Andes in the western portion of South America. Contrary to expectations, there will also be futuristic maps, such as a cyberpunk-themed city. To explore these new areas, players will be able to take on some new jobs, which are not only a new place to put experience points into but also offer a breath of fresh air in terms of gameplay.

                  The Future of Final Fantasy XIV, Server Issues, &amp; Cultural Representation: An Interview With Naoki Yoshida   Screen Rant has talked to Naoki Yoshida, also known as Yoshi-P, about the future of FFXIV, cultural representations in Dawntrail, and more.   


 FFXIV Dawntrail Will Have Two New DPS Jobs 
         




The next expansion for FFXIV will have two new DPS Jobs. The first of them is a dual-wield melee DPS called Viper. This specific Job was announced during the Final Fantasy Fan Fest in October 2023 and is represented by the usage of dual one-handed blades that can be combined into a two-handed weapon. The second DPS Job to be included with Dawntrail is called Pictomancer. This will be a Ranged Magical DPS that is noticeable for its gear. The Pictomancer will use a paintbrush in battle. These are the only two full Job additions confirmed for the Dawntrail expansion and no other should be announced before its release.



In the same Fan Festival presentation in Tokyo that revealed the Pictomancer Job, held on Square Enix’s channel on YouTube, the developer also announced a new Limited Job called Beastmaster. This will be the second Limited Job in the game, following Blue Mage, and should be added at some point in 7.x. Limited Jobs are not counted as regular Jobs since they are not allowed in every type of activity. No further details about Beastmaster have been provided so far.






 Everything About The Viper Job In FFXIV: Dawntrail 
          




As was previously mentioned, Viper is a melee DPS Job to be added with the Dawntrail expansion. Viper’s starting level will be 80 and is not related to any other pre-existing classes. To unlock Viper in FFXIV Dawntrail, players will have to have at least one Disciple of War or Magic Job at level 80 and complete the Job’s related starting quest, which will be made available in Ul’dah. Viper uses two blades that can be combined at their hilts into a single longer weapon. Each weapon form grants different abilities. Changing between these two battle stances will be vital to the new Job’s gameplay rotation.


 

When it comes to gear equipped by the Viper, the Job will use items of the Scouting category, which is currently exclusive to the Rogue / Ninja Jobs. As such, Vipers should usually opt for gear represented by leather clothing rather than heavy steel armor plaques. The Viper should be quick on its feet and move around swiftly. This lore-based aspect of the Job will be represented through its stats in the Dawntrail expansion for FFXIV. The main stat used by the Viper is Dexterity. This stat will dictate the heavy bulk of the Job’s damage output in combat and is at the core of every build.




Because it is a melee DPS, however, the Viper will still rely on other important stats, such as Critical Hit, Skill Speed, and Direct Hit, for instance. In terms of accessories, Viper will use pieces from the Aiming category. Vipers have a special mechanic, in which they build up strength through their regular gameplay rotation and then unleash it all for increased damage against enemies. This mechanic is represented through a blue flaming aura that can be seen in the gameplay trailer for Viper in Dawntrail, posted on the official Final Fantasy XIV channel on YouTube. Viper is a completely new Job in the franchise, exclusive to FFXIV for now.



Viper will be the second dual-wield melee DPS job in FFXIV, along with Rogue / Ninja.






 Everything About The Pictomancer Job In FFXIV: Dawntrail 
          




Contrary to the Viper’s melee approach, the Pictomancer is the next upcoming Ranged Magical DPS in the game. Pictomancer first appeared in Final Fantasy VI with Relm and has not been featured in any of the core games since then. Like Viper, Pictomancer does not have a prerequisite class and will be unlockable for FFXIV players who have at least one Disciple of War or Magic Job at level 80. Its starting quest will be in Gridania rather than Ul’dah. Pictomancers in FFXIV will use a magical paintbrush and a color palette in battle, casting colorful paint-based spells with these items.



Krile, a long-time ally of the Warrior of Light, has become a Pictomancer, which may enable her to join the fight in the upcoming content.




The gear Pictomancers will equip is of the Casting category, which is shared with Jobs such as Black Mage, Summoner, and Red Mage – the Limited Job Blue Mage can also equip Casting gear. The main stat players will want to invest in when playing with a Pictomancer is Intelligence, as this will dictate the power of its spells. Another important stat is Spell Speed, which can help decrease casting times. The class, however, will have instant-cast abilities. The Pictomancer fights by painting a variety of things, from monsters and weapons to landscapes. Each of these paintings results in different gameplay abilities in FFXIV: Dawntrail.




                  FFXIV On Xbox Has An Incredible Deal For New Players   No matter what the platform, it&#39;s a great time to get into Final Fantasy XIV. Xbox players in particular can look forward to a great deal.   

Other than attacking opponents, the Pictomancer will also be able to buff their party members, boosting their abilities. This should be a mix between a traditional DPS and a support unit. Pictomancer should not have the offensive firepower of a Black Mage nor the healing abilities of a Sage, for instance, but be able to help with both types of roles. It has been confirmed that Pictomancers cannot resurrect allies in FFXIV, like Red Mages.

Other than the two new Jobs, the Dawntrail expansion will have plenty of new additions, such as the female form of the Hrothgar race and the long-awaited graphic update. Players can also expect more core content, from story missions to alliance raids, and much more. Despite wrapping up its 10-year Light and Darkness saga, FFXIV’s future still seems full of exciting content to play through, from the Viper and Pictomancer Jobs to the new adventures of the Warrior of Light outside of Eorzea.
