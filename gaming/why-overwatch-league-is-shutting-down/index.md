# Why Overwatch League Is Shutting Down


## SUMMARY 



  Following the conclusion of the 2023 season, two-thirds of Overwatch League teams elected to depart from the league, prompting Activision Blizzard to transition away from the current model.   Activision Blizzard will pay nearly $120 million to the 20 contracted teams as they move towards founding a new framework for competitive Overwatch play.   The closure of the Overwatch League was not surprising given Activision Blizzard&#39;s overestimated ambitions, financial burdens, and the impact of a gender discrimination scandal that led to sponsors cutting ties and a decline in fan interest.

## Literature Review

Activision Blizzard has announced that the Overwatch League will be shutting down; however, competitive Overwatch esports will not be gone forever.




Following the conclusion of the 2023 season, a vote was held by the owners of the 20 contracted Overwatch teams concerning the future of the Overwatch League. With a reported two-thirds of teams electing to depart from the Overwatch League, a spokesperson from Activision Blizzard has announced that the company plans to transition away from the current model in favor of founding a new framework for competitive Overwatch play.




Following the vote, Activision Blizzard will pay close to $120 million to the 20 contracted teams; while the company has announced that it will be &#34;transitioning&#34; away from this competitive esports program, it will &#34;remain focused&#34; on offering an esports program; however, not under the Overwatch League banner. Announced in 2016 and founded in 2017, the Overwatch League, sought to revolutionize and legitimize esports by adopting a system of city-based franchises similar to conventional sporting leagues such as the NFL or the NBA. Though it did not exactly replicate traditional sports, the Overwatch League played a fundamental role in the development of esports.

 What Happened To The Overwatch League? 
Why Did Franchise Owners Turn Their Backs On The Overwatch League?
          




Around the time of the 2023 Overwatch League final, Activision Blizzard enormously reduced the staff of its esports division, a fact that sent warning signs to numerous fans and undoubtedly to the franchise owners. In October 2023, Activision Blizzard&#39;s esports leadership team issued a path-forward plan to the owners of the 20 Overwatch League franchises, as well as paperwork allowing team owners to cast their vote on the future of the league with a resounding majority of two-thirds, the team owners elected to depart the Overwatch League - a decision that has confirmed speculation that Activision Blizzard will pull the plug.

While undoubtedly disappointing for fans of the league, the closure of the Overwatch League will likely come as no surprise, as the lofty ambitions of Activision Blizzard have never materialized. With early proclamations that each of the 20 teams would build their own stadiums as well as take part in home-and-away-style matches in a manner similar to traditional sports, Activision Blizzard seems to have enormously overestimated the degree of interest and marketability possessed by esports. Despite this, however, in their announcement, the company&#39;s spokesperson expressed their gratitude to fans and players for helping make the Overwatch League a possibility.






 What Went Wrong For The Overwatch League? 
Financial Obligations And A Gender Discrimination Scandal
         

According to a 2017 ESPN Report, the founding Overwatch League teams each paid Activision Blizzard $20 million, with 8 expansion slots later sold for up to $35 million each. This remarkably cumbersome franchise fee made it incredibly difficult for team owners and financial backers to see a return on their substantial investments; however, The Jacob Wolfe Report found that the vast majority of teams in the Overwatch and Call of Duty leagues deferred franchise payments during the Covid-19 pandemic, and as a result, Activision Blizzard was owed a total of between $390 and $420 million - a fact that may have contributed to the majority decision to dissolve the Overwatch League.

Although the outstanding entry fees of Overwatch League teams were waived in mid-2023, the early ambitious claims of Activision Blizzard never came to fruition - a fact made even worse by a gender discrimination scandal that rocked Activision Blizzard. In 2021, a lawsuit that alleges the company has engaged in abuse, discrimination, and retaliation against its female employees was filed against Activision Blizzard by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Following the announcement of this lawsuit, several major sponsors cut ties with the Overwatch League; furthermore, fan interest in the league and Overwatch 2 has plummeted in recent years.



 The Future Of Overwatch Esports 
Can Overwatch Esports Become Popular Again?
          

While the Overwatch League will soon be officially dead, as noted by the Activision Blizzard spokesperson, the concept of Overwatch esports is very much alive and well. Though it has not yet been confirmed by the company, industry insider and investigative reporter, Jacob Wolf revealed in early November 2023 that Activision Blizzard is reportedly hoping to run the next iteration of its Overwatch esports program in collaboration with ESL FACEIT - a leading esports organizer and broadcaster, and a subsidiary of the Saudi Public Investment Fund owned Savvy Games Group. ESL FACEIT is the company behind the broadcasting and promotion of Activision Blizzard&#39;s other esports organization, the Call of Duty League.




With negotiations between ESL FACEIT and Activision Blizzard allegedly beginning long before the call for the Overwatch League team owner&#39;s vote, it seems as though serious doubts as to the league&#39;s future have been longstanding. While the Overwatch League has been incredibly influential in legitimizing esports on the global stage, it has proven to be a very expensive endeavor for franchise owners - to the point where many of the team owners who also own traditional sports franchises are expected to put a permanent end to their short-lived esports experiments. Though Activision Blizzard is adamant that competitive Overwatch esports play will return, the Overwatch League is gone for good.



Editorâ€™s Note: A lawsuit has been filed against Activision Blizzard by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which alleges the company has engaged in abuse, discrimination, and retaliation against its female employees. Activision Blizzard has denied the allegations. The full details of the Activision Blizzard lawsuit (content warning: rape, suicide, abuse, harassment) are being updated as new information becomes available.
