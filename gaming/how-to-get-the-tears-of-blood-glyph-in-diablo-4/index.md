## Literature Review

Season 2 of Diablo 4 has introduced many new items to get for upgrading builds, including The Tears of Blood Glyph, which scales up to level 200.





Paragon Glyphs like The Tears of Blood are typically special items dropped from dungeons around your map and are upgraded by spending experience points earned from Nightmare Dungeons in Diablo 4. Inserting one of these Glyphs into your Paragon Board affects multiple Nodes that give passive buffs around it. Your character&#39;s path in the endgame relies heavily on what Glyphs you use.

 How To Find The Tears of Blood Glyph in Diablo 4 
          

The only way to find The Tears of Blood Glyph is to complete the Abattoir of Zir dungeon after you finish all seven chapters of the Season of Blood journey. You have to tackle every objective tied to each section of the story to unlock the dungeon that gives the Glyph as a final reward. The last quests will let you craft a Blood-Forged Sigil with an Occultist vendor to access the Abattoir of Zir in Diablo 4.



The Blood-Forged Sigil costs 60,000 Gold and 800 Sigil Power to craft, so complete side quests or other content to get the materials you need first.




Once you have the Sigil, travel to the Ked Bardu Waypoint and find the Blood Portal that allows characters to enter the dungeon. All you need to do to get The Tears of Blood is complete the challenge in the Abattoir of Zir, which involves slaying a certain number of enemies before the timer runs out. This task should be simple enough if your character has many of the new Vampiric Powers in Season 2 of Diablo 4.




A final boss in the dungeon should be all that stands in the way of your character and the Glyph. This endgame attachment increases Damage for every five Core stats purchased within range on your Paragon Board and gives a percentage bonus to all Rare nodes within range. This boost scales as you level up, providing an extra 10% every 10 levels up to an astounding level 200 in Diablo 4.

As you grow in power, The Tears of Blood Glyph will evolve with your character, making it a significant part of your build in Diablo 4.
