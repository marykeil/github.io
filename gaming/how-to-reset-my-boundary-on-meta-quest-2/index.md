The Meta Quest 2 VR Headset is a great way to experience VR gaming, but only if your boundary has been properly set up or reset before playing.





First and foremost, players need to ensure that their Meta Quest 2 is set up and both the headset and controllers are charged, as they will need both things to reset the boundary. Next, place the headset on, and you should immediately spawn into your customizable main hub room, where you can access your dashboard.

 How To Reset Stationary &amp; Roomscale Boundary On The Meta Quest 2 
         

First and foremost, players should acknowledge whether their boundary needs to be reset. If you&#39;re playing in the same space as your last session and haven&#39;t had issues, the boundary is fine and does not need a reset. However, if you are in a new space or notice that while playing games on the Meta Quest 2, you keep reaching or moving out of your zone, it likely needs to be reset, and you may even need to find a larger space to place it in. To begin, follow the steps below:

  Turn on your headset and press the Meta button on the right controller to pull up the menu. You can also go to your main hub room, which is typically where you auto-spawn upon placing the headset on, to see the menu appear at the bottom of the screen if your Meta Quest 2 has already been set up previously.   Use your controller to now hover over the area of the menu where the clock, Wi-Fi, and battery percentages can be seen. You should see a text box pop up that says Quick Settings.   Click to open up the Quick Settings Menu. There should be an option on this screen that says Boundary.   Select the Boundary option, and you will then be prompted to select a Stationary Boundary or Roomscale Boundary. Stationary is for players who intend to sit while using the Meta Quest 2. Select your preferred play style.   After selecting either Stationary or Roomscale, the Meta Quest 2 will instruct you on how to set up your selected Boundary, so follow the on-screen prompts to complete the set-up.  






Note that a Roomscale Boundary will require you to draw your boundary manually. Ensure you are in a large enough space without obstacles to ensure safety and a proper play environment. A 6.5 ft x 6.5 ft area is recommended for the best results. For stationary, you will not be required to draw your boundary as it will be auto-centered around where you are seated, with a 3-foot radius.




This same process can be followed whenever the boundary malfunctions or you move to a new play space. Additionally, for those looking for a shortcut to the boundary reset screen, you can also step outside your current boundary, and the Meta Quest 2 will auto-prompt you with the option to reset it. Accept the prompt, and you will begin the same boundary reset process with instructions to guide you.
