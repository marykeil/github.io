## Literature Review

OD is the newest game to be revealed from acclaimed director Hideo Kojima, and he&#39;s already lined up some major Hollywood talent to star in it.




OD is the newest exciting game project from veteran game director Hideo Kojima, and it looks like it will be getting some major acting talent on board. Kojima&#39;s pedigree gives the game the ability to attract some real star power, with the legacy of the Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding making a strong testament to his creative abilities. Information about OD is still fairly limited, but some key actors who will feature in it have already been revealed, along with some hints at what the game could be like.
Kojima&#39;s appearance at The Game Awards 2023 provided the opportunity to reveal OD as a new horror game made in partnership with Xbox Game Studios and the involvement of acclaimed director Jordan Peele. Although it&#39;s not yet clear just how OD will play, with the announcement making unusual promises about the experience not being a normal game in the typical Kojima style, it&#39;s immediately reminiscent of PT, the playable teaser for the canceled Silent Hills game that Kojima was previously developing with Guillermo del Toro. This time, however, there&#39;s no reason not to believe that the project will ultimately see a full release.

Although not all characters in the recently-announced Death Stranding 2 have been revealed, the known cast list has both new and returning actors.












 








 Kojima Has A History With Celebrity Actors 
Death Stranding Features Major Appearances


 







It&#39;s no surprise that OD is going for some big names, as Kojima has a long history of working with famous actors. Metal Gear Solid 5 saw veteran voice actor David Hayter replaced by Hollywood figure Kiefer Sutherland in a somewhat controversial move, and Death Stranding is a veritable tapestry of big names. Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, and Léa Seydoux all occupy major roles, and Death Stranding 2 is set to throw Elle Fanning into the mix. In the case of OD, the teaser available on the official Xbox YouTube channel shows that this tradition is definitely set to continue.







 Sophia Lillis 
It, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Asteroid City
        

The OD trailer at the Game Awards 2023 ceremony opened with an appearance from Sophia Lillis, who recites a sentence about a hungry purple dinosaur that crams all phonetic sounds in English into one go. Although Lillis is only 21, she&#39;s already made a huge name for herself in Hollywood, making her a major figure to pull for a potentially leading role. Lillis first skyrocketed to fame through her role as Beverly Marsh in the 2017 film adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s It, which gave her some standout sequences that highlighted an incredibly impressive performance.
Lillis has had no trouble landing parts since then, from a role as the younger version of Amy Adams&#39;s character in the HBO miniseries Sharp Objects to further horror appearances in It Chapter Two and Gretel &amp; Hansel. 2023 has been a huge year for the actress, with major roles in The Adults, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, and Asteroid City occupying the calendar. The end of the OD teaser makes use of her scream queen experience, showing the reflection of a door opening in her eyes before she screams and the title appears.





 Hunter Schafer 
Euphoria, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Belle
        

Hunter Schafer is the second actress to appear in the teaser trailer for Kojima&#39;s OD, repeating the same sentence with an emotional crack in her voice and an expression of distress on her face. Like Sophia Lillis, Schafer shot to fame with exceptional speed, although Schafer got her big break on television with HBO&#39;s Euphoria. On the show, she plays Jules Vaughn, a new girl in town whose optimism and kindness provide a stark relief to some of the more vicious characters in the narrative.
Although Schafer hasn&#39;t been as busy as Lillis on the silver screen, she has featured in two major film roles. She provided the voice for Ruka in the English dub of Mamoru Hosoda&#39;s animated film Belle, likewise a supporting character in a high school situation. In 2023, she appeared as Tigris Snow in The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, a prequel to the original dystopian franchise that tells the story of the villainous President Snow in his own youth. Schafer appeared on Teen Vogue&#39;s &#34;21 Under 21&#34; list as an acknowledgment of her activism against anti-LGBT legislation.





 Udo Kier 
Suspiria, Armageddon, Melancholia
        

The final appearance in the OD trailer is from Udo Kier, a completely different presence from the young actresses. An acclaimed German character actor, Kier has been working in film since the late 1960s. His most remembered earlier work was mostly in the realm of cult horror, building a reputation through titles like Mark of the Devil, Flesh for Frankenstein, and Blood for Dracula. He played Dr. Frank Mandel in the 1977 Dario Argento film Suspiria, although he didn&#39;t star in the 2018 remake from Luca Guadagnino.
Over the years, Kier has appeared in films like Blade, Armageddon, andRob Zombie&#39;s Halloween reboot. He&#39;s also a staple feature in Lars von Trier films, showing up in Melancholia, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, and more. His film catalogue is supported by plentiful work in television and music videos, and OD isn&#39;t Kier&#39;s first dalliance in video games. He played the villainous Yuri in the Command &amp; Conquer series and more recently took on the roles of Dr. Peter Straub in Call of Duty: WWII and Erich in Martha is Dead.

 Other Actors Who Could Appear In Kojima&#39;s OD 
Kojima Has Taken Pictures With Other Celebrities
        

Although no other actors have been confirmed for OD yet, it&#39;s quite possible that more will show up in the future. Margaret Qualley, an actress known for films like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Nice Guys, and Poor Things, is rumored for the game based on potential leaks from earlier in the year. Another good avenue to examine is Kojima&#39;s tweets, which often include photos with celebrities that he ultimately works alongside. Jordan Peele is a recent example, as a post of him at Kojima Productions predated his appearance promoting the game.
Looking at other celebrities who have recently shown up alongside Kojima reveals a couple of exciting possibilities. He posted a picture with Elijah Wood on Twitter on the day of The Game Awards ceremony, meaning that the actor behind Frodo in The Lord of the Rings could be a contender. Timothee Chalamet could also be a Kojima collaborator, with recent pictures being further supported by Chalamet&#39;s appearance at The Game Awards. Although it&#39;s too early to know what the full cast could be, the chance that Hideo Kojima has more major actors to reveal inOD is certainly on the table.
