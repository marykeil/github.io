## Literature Review

The strongest melee weapon found in The Last Faith is The Rift of Blood, a sword that you can unlock by completing four different combat challenges.





There are four Bloody Chalices scattered around Osseus Fortress that you can interact with to spill blood from the goblets decorated on the altar in the center of the area. In contrast to how you unlock Leena&#39;s Bow in The Last Faith, you have to travel to multiple locations before opening the path toward the Rift of Blood. Some places are difficult to find as you explore the massive Ruins map.

Finding the locations mentioned below will first put you into a room where gates lock the entrance and the path forward as waves of enemies spawn in the room. You must take down every foe that appears to press on and reach the Chalice contraptions in The Last Faith. Simply interact with the small shrines you find beyond the enemy hordes to play a short cutscene that shows blood pouring into the main altar goblets.

  Bloody Chalice   How to Find   Map Image    Chalice #1   Go toward the upper left section of the Damned Ruins, past a ledge with a silver handle that you must grapple to using one of your unlocked abilities.                           Chalice #2   Destroy a wall to the right of a stone statue reaching to the sky on the platforms below the large columns, then travel through the gate ahead of you.                           Chalice #3   Head to the left from the Checkpoint in the icy caverns at the bottom of the region, then destroy the wall at the other end of the next area to reveal a hidden path to the Chalice.                           Chalice #4   Attack yet another wall to break it and reveal a hidden passage near the elevator in the upper right section of the region.                          








The final Chalice combat challenge is by far the hardest because you have to fight enemies on a few limited platforms instead of in an open space. The space in between each platform is littered with spikes, which can kill you instantly.

 How To Get The Rift of Blood Weapon 
          

Once the final Chalice has been filled, you can now interact with the altar to be transported into a room with several chests, with one containing the Rift of Blood weapon. This sword deals Physical and Bleed damage, with a high Crit Damage but low Crit Chance. You must have at least 18 Strength, 20 Dexterity, and 16 Mind to wield this bloody instrument into battle against enemies in The Last Faith.

A Unique Skill from this heavy katana has you perform a downward slash that creates erupting pillars of blood that significantly damage enemies. This ability costs Focus, so make sure you have consumables that can restore this resource often. When you unlock the Rift of Blood melee weapon in The Last Faith, you arguably have the strongest sword to take on the game&#39;s tough bosses.
