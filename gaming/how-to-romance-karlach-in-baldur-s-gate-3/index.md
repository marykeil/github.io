## Literature Review

To romance Karlach in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players must always be compassionate and heroic. Helping her fix her infernal engine heart is also essential.





To romance a companion in Baldur’s Gate 3, you need to win their Approval by picking dialogue and story choices they like. This is harder for some companions than others, and it can be tough to balance approval once you’ve assembled a full party of ragtag misfits. Luckily for anyone who wants to romance Karlach, winning her Approval is refreshingly straightforward: be a hero whenever and wherever you can.





 How To Win Karlach’s Approval In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

Unless you’re roleplaying as an irredeemable villain, it will be difficult to actually make decisions that Karlach doesn’t approve of. She loves heroism, compassion, and justice, and likes it when the player character goes out of their way to help those in need.

Siding with the Emerald Grove in Act One is essential; Karlach will leave the party if you choose to raid the grove with the goblins.

You’ll also have lots of opportunities to win approval during certain quests, including:

  Persuading Kagha to release Arabella, and calling her out for threatening a child.   Agreeing with Zevlor when he asks the party to kill the goblin leaders.   Saving Halsin in the Goblin Camp and telling him to get to safety.   Choosing not to help Auntie Ethel and supporting Mayrina.  




This heroism even extends to animals; she loves it if you choose to save the Owlbear Cub and let it stay at camp. However, despite her softer side, Karlach also loves a good fight and will approve if you start fights and threaten enemies with violence.



Despite her love of fights, you can also earn Karlach’s Approval by using dialogue options to avoid violence. This includes Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation, but also extends to more unusual dialogue options such as Performance.




Finally, you’ll also win Approval by supporting Karlach personally and completing her personal companion quests.



 How To Complete Karlach’s Personal Quests In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

Karlach has a bit of a history with Wyll, another potential companion. It’s important that you support and recruit her during your first meeting, even though Wyll will suffer some unpleasant consequences as a result. Karlach will also reveal that her heart was replaced by an infernal engine, which makes her too hot to touch.




          

Over the course of the story, you’ll have the chance to help her fix the engine and cool off. To help her, you need to bring Infernal Iron to Dammon, a Tiefling smith, who has the skill to modify Karlach’s infernal engine heart.

You can do this in Act One by finding Infernal Iron in the same forge where you’ll work to craft a Masterwork weapon in the Blighted Village. This can be brought to Dammon in the Emerald Grove, where he can complete the first modification to the infernal engine. Dammon also appears later in the game, and he can make further modifications with more Infernal Iron.

          




With enough Approval in Act One, you can approach Karlach and express your feelings. This leads to a scene where you can convince her to let you kiss her. However, despite Dammon’s modification, she is still hot to the touch, and you might burn your lips if you haven’t cooled her down with water or magic first.



With enough approval, Karlach might even approach the player character first.




Another romantic encounter with Karlach can occur in Act Two, and players can pursue the relationship into Act Three. This leads to a sequence where the player character and Karlach can go on a date, unlocking Baldur’s Gate 3’s Hot Date achievement. However, although Karlach&#39;s romance is lovely and wholesome, players should also be prepared for some tragedy later in her story.
