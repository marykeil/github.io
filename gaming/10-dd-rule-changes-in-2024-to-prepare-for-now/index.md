## Literature Review

2024 will overhaul Dungeons &amp; Dragons in major ways, and getting a grasp of some of the changes ahead of time will make the transition easier.




2024 is set to be a big year for Dungeons &amp; Dragons rule changes, and the transition will be a lot easier for players who get accustomed to some of the more major ones ahead of time. The fifth edition of DnD has undergone some evolution over the years, but mostly in a carefully managed way, with more robust class options or new playable races being drip-fed across a number of books. With the advent of the supposedly perpetual One D&amp;D, however, a sweeping overhaul is happening that could significantly alter the balance of characters or campaigns.
The2024 DnD changes have undergone plenty of evolution through playtesting so far, as Wizards of the Coast pushes major shake-ups out through Unearthed Arcana releases that allow the community to check them out and respond. Most recently, Playtest 8 altered barbarians, druids, and monks, and switched up the abilities of some spells. There aren&#39;t any hard dates yet for the release of new rulebooks, so more ideas could be revealed or shifted around before things are finalized, but the picture of what DnD will be after 2024 is becoming clearer and clearer.
            
 
 Even After Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, D&amp;D Games Might Be In Trouble 
Quality Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games used to be released consistently, but the bleak period before Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 calls the future into question.












 








 10  Conjure Spells Are Changed In One D&amp;D 
Conjure Spells Summon AoE Effects
        

Spells like conjure animals are a bit of a mess in DnD 5e, as adding multiple entities to the initiative order can bog things down, and the summoning spells in Tasha&#39;s Cauldron of Everything tend to be a bit more consistent. Playtest 8 changes the original batch of conjure spells to summon distinct effects rather than entities that enter initiative, simplifying things and making them more distinct from the Tasha&#39;s summoning spells. The new conjure minor elementals has incredibly aggressive scaling, however, so it&#39;s likely that it will see some tweaks before the final release.





 9  D&amp;D Cantrips Are Rebalanced In 2024 
Cantrips Are Receiving Both Buffs &amp; Nerfs
        

Cantrips are the bread and butter of low-level magic users in DnD, and they can be a great fallback even at higher levels when resources are running thin. Based on the current status of Unearthed Arcana, 2024 will see changes to key cantrips like spare the dying and guidance. Spellcasters should acquaint themselves with the reworks in advance, as knowing what&#39;s been improved can open the door to smarter and more powerful play.
            
 
 One D&amp;D&#39;s Latest Cantrip Updates Make Spellcasters Even More Overpowered 
The latest One D&amp;D Unearthed Arcana release updates some classic 5e cantrips, raising the power level of spellcasters even higher than before.








 8  Barbarians Can Rage More In 2024 
Barbarians Regain A Rage Charge Each Short Rest


 







In long adventuring days, one big problem with low-level barbarians is how quickly they can burn through Rage, their most distinct class feature. Unearthed Arcana Playtest 8 lets barbarians regain one Rage charge every short rest, making conservation of the feature a little more manageable. Nothing changes with long rests, which will still fully recharge Rage.





 7  Bastions Are New D&amp;D Strongholds 
Base-Building Is A Big 2024 Addition
        

Bastions aren&#39;t really a change to the core ruleset of DnD so much as they are an addition, but it&#39;s best to get used to the idea in advance. As a method of creating home bases that relies on a specific ruleset, bastions add a new dimension to the gameplay. Dungeon masters at tables that like this part of DnD should prepare for a bigger focus on it, as some parties will no doubt spend more time than ever on their bases.





 6  Monks Have More Survivability In One D&amp;D 
New Features Make Monks Avoid More Attacks


 







Monks have been a source of some trouble while working out an updated ruleset for DnD, as their 5e treatment has generally left a lot to be desired despite some powerful items for monks to employ. Playtest 8 seems to have figured out the best balance yet, transforming Deflect Missiles to the more powerful Deflect Attacks and changing some actions to bonus actions. Meanwhile, features like Self Restoration and Superior Defense can be activated without expending either an action or a bonus action.





 5  One D&amp;D Saving Throws Can Be Voluntarily Failed 
Characters Don&#39;t Have To Attempt Success
        

Scenarios where players might want to fail a saving throw in DnD aren&#39;t particularly common, but they do tend to crop up on occasion, and DnD 5e doesn&#39;t address the situation clearly. The new Player&#39;s Handbook will delineate that failing saving throws intentionally is specifically allowed. Whether attempting to prove something or leaning into roleplay decisions, it&#39;s good to remember this clarification.





 4  Exhaustion Is More Straightforward In One D&amp;D 
Exhaustion Levels Follow A Basic Pattern
        

Exhaustion is getting streamlined in 2024, with each level of exhaustion adding a -1 modifier to d20 rolls. This may be a bigger change for tables used to playing without exhaustion, as some dungeon masters who currently ignore the system might implement it now that it won&#39;t be as much of a hassle. All the same, it could slow down rolls with the additional modifiers.





 3  D&amp;D Martial Classes Get Weapon Mastery 
Weapons All Have Mastery Properties


 







Weapon Mastery is a new feature for 2024 that gives martial classes a little more unique specialization than in the past. Picking mastery over a specific weapon type grants access to unique mastery properties for weapons, which can increase damage, targets, knockback, and more. Martial classes in campaigns that plan to adjust for the new changes should spend some time thinking about the perfect Weapon Mastery.





 2  Backgrounds Can Be Customized In One D&amp;D 
Backgrounds Can Be Created From Scratch
        

Backgrounds aren&#39;t the most robust element of DnD 5e, gesturing at vague aspects of someone&#39;s prior life and offering a few preset proficiencies and features. 2024 is bringing some big changes by letting players make backgrounds from the ground-up and selecting what bonuses they receive according to some guidelines. Anyone big on tweaking characters might want to spend some time thinking about choosing a DnD background in advance of the new rules.





 1  D&amp;D Combat Healing Is Way Better In 2024 
Spells Like Cure Wounds Get Extra Dice
        

Healing in Dungeons &amp; Dragons combat can sometimes feel like a nearly futile exercise, especially when a character gets trapped in a loop of getting downed and popping back up because the incoming damage is greater than the healing. Playtest 8 introduced changes to combat healing spells that add extra dice to cure wounds, healing word, mass cure wounds, and mass healing word, significantly buffing classes like clerics. This might make some fights go on longer, but the biggest thing for players to rethink is risk management in battle.
