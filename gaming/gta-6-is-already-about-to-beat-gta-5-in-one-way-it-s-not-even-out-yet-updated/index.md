## Literature Review

Rockstar Games revealed the first trailer for GTA 6, which already seems to be on its way to beating a major record held by its predecessor, GTA 5.






UPDATE: December 6, 2023 - GTA 6&#39;s first trailer has now overtaken the total number of lifetime views for GTA 5&#39;s reveal trailer within a day. Original story follows.







Rockstar Games revealed the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, which already seems to be on its way to beating the record held by its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto 5. The trailer confirmed the game&#39;s Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo, Lucia and Jason, and provided a look at the game&#39;s Florida-inspired location, Leonida, which includes a modernized version of the fan-favorite location, Vice City.

Grand Theft Auto V&#39;s trailer had amassed over 92 million views on YouTube by the time of GTA 6&#39;s trailer reveal and was the most-watched trailer for an action game. As of the time of writing, Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s reveal trailer has been viewed over 84 million times in 21 hours on Rockstar Games&#39; YouTube channel, and is currently the #1 trending video on the platform, making the possibility that it will beat the record held by its predecessor extremely likely.

                  GTA 6 Trailer Released Early After Leak, Rockstar Confirms Release Year For Next Massive Game   After years of waiting, Rockstar has finally revealed the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, showing off the game&#39;s location and characters.

Apart from overtaking Grand Theft Auto 5&#39;s reveal trailer, Grand Theft Auto 6 has broken another, even larger record on YouTube. MrBeast previously held the record for most YouTube views in 24 hours for a non-music video with his August 2023 video &#34;Every Country On Earth Fights For $250,000!&#34;, which amassed 46 million views in a day, something that GTA 6&#39;s trailer passed in less than 12 hours.


 

Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer is also already the most-liked trailer on YouTube in less than a day. The record was held by the first trailer for Avengers: Infinity War, which racked up 4.1 million likes in over 6 years. The previous gaming trailer with the most likes was the reveal for Battlefield 1 with 2.4 million likes. Both of these records were decimated by the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, which beat it in just a few hours and holds over 8.4 million likes as of the time of writing.






Grand Theft Auto 6 is due to release sometime in 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X devices, with a PC release likely due some time after.




Rockstar released Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer several hours before its previously announced time due to it leaking, something that&#39;s becoming a pattern with the highly-anticipated title after the 90 development videos that flooded the internet last year. Despite this, it&#39;s clear that the hype for the game is immense, and these leaks have done nothing to slow this down.
