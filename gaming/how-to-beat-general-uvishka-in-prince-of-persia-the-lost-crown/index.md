## Literature Review

The first boss you face in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is General Uvishka, a fearsome enemy warrior who you have to beat in two intense phases.





General Uvishka is part of the tutorial level for Prince of Persia: TLC, and is found not too long after you are taught the basic fighting mechanics against Kushan soldiers. Even without time-warping abilities, Sargon has every tool they need to take down this fearsome leader. Unlike E.M.M.I enemies in Metroid Dread, you don&#39;t need to gain a new skill and return to Uvishka later to defeat him.




                  Why Metroid Dread&#39;s E.M.M.I. Are So Terrifying   Metroid Dread&#39;s E.M.M.I. units are some of the scariest enemies that Samus Aran has ever encountered, possibly more than the titular Metroids.   


 How to Defeat General Uvishka (Phase 1) 
          

The best way to take down General Uvishka is to dodge his unblockable attacks, parry his basic strikes, and watch out for a chance to land a Vengeful Counter. Sargon has a variety of attacks you can perform with his twin swords, but it can be hard to find the right balance between attacking and defending. Don&#39;t forget to dodge and slide forward to avoid the boss&#39; moves as well in Prince of Persia: TLC.

The first phase of the boss fight against Uvishka starts with the general on a massive horse that charges at you, but doesn&#39;t attack on its own. Uvishka will attack with his large trident, but you can press L2 to parry the basic swings of this weapon with the right timing in Prince of Persia: TLC. Pressing Forward &#43; R2 lets you slide underneath the horse and reposition Sargon for a better angle of attack.




                  Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Preview: A Delightful Mix Between A Classic Franchise &amp; Modern Metroidvanias   Screen Rant went hands-on with Ubisoftâ€™s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown at Brazil Game Show 2023. Here are our first impressions of the game.   

Be careful when Uvishka leaps high into the air off his horse, or when his eyes glow red in any way. This means the boss is about to unleash an unblockable attack, which cannot be parried. In fact, attempting to parry an unblockable strike will cause Sargon to take even more damage than he would normally from the attack in Prince of Persia: TLC.



Don&#39;t forget to use your Potion to heal once throughout the boss fight, since Sargon only has three health bars at this point in the game.




Eventually, you will see Uvishka charge forward glowing yellow as the game slows down somewhat. This indicates an opportunity for a Vengeful Counter, or a cinematic counter-attack that plays if you parry a yellow attack from an enemy. Doing this at around half of the boss&#39; health will play a short scene where Sargon knocks Uvishka off his horse, and into the second phase of the fight.






 How to Defeat General Uvishka (Phase 2) 
          

The second phase of this boss fight is actually easier than the first, since all Sargon needs to do is parry Uvishka&#39;s attacks and attack the general relentlessly. Uvishka&#39;s strikes take longer to swing on the ground, and are straightforward stabbing attacks rather than the wide, sweeping slashes made in phase 1. This should give you a bit more time to parry successfully in Prince of Persia: TLC.

Land full combo strings when you land a parry to deal tons of damage to the Kushan warrior, but don&#39;t forget to use your defensive maneuvers to avoid getting hit. Those who beat General Uvishka in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown will have a better grasp on the game&#39;s combat for the challenges that are yet to come.
