## Literature Review

If you want to buy upgrades or amulets in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, you&#39;ll need to farm a lot of Time Crystals. Luckily, they&#39;re easy to find.





If you explore the world and complete quests, you&#39;re sure to collect a lot of Time Crystals. While crystal ore deposits, boss battles, and treasure chests offer plenty of goodies, they don&#39;t respawn. This means that the further you get into the game, the fewer Time Crystals you can collect through quests and exploration. Luckily, Sargon has some renewable sources of income available to him.




                  8 Beginner Tips You Need To Know For Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   The combat and exploration of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be confusing for beginners, but a few tips can mold Sargon into a great warrior.   


 Wak Wak Trees &amp; Enemy Farming 
          

Wak Wak Trees act as save points throughout Mount Qaf. When Sargon interacts with them, he can restore his Health, swap out his amulets/Athra Surges, and prepare for the next stretch of his adventure. Wak Wak Trees also respawn all enemies, making them the perfect starting point for Time Crystal farming.

                  10 Best Amulets To Equip First in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   Amulets provide powerful buffs for Sargon in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, but the best abilities to equip first depend on each item&#39;s potential.   




When you defeat an enemy in Prince of Persia: TLC, you&#39;ll get a few Time Crystals for your troubles. As such, if you need a few more Time Crystals, travel to an enemy-dense section of Mount Qaf and defeat all the enemies in the area. When that&#39;s done, head to the nearest Wak Wak Tree to heal and respawn all the enemies you just killed. You can rinse and repeat this process until you have enough Time Crystals to purchase your desired upgrades.



 Completing Artaban&#39;s Challenges 
          

There&#39;s another source of Time Crystals that, while not as renewable and exciting as enemy farming, is still important to collect. When you visit The Haven, you can talk to Artaban, a fellow Immortal, and take up his Challenges. These Challenges are combat tutorials where you practice new skills and prepare to fight enemies in Mount Qaf.




Although you may scoff at the idea of purposefully playing through more tutorials, Artaban&#39;s Challenges offer Time Crystals if you complete them. If you&#39;re short on Time Crystals and still have a few Challenges left to complete, take the time to visit Artaban and practice your skills. It should give you just enough Time Crystals to get your dream upgrades and master Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.
