## Literature Review

2024 is shaping up to be another big year for PC gaming, with a large number of highly-anticipated games set to release on the platform.




While 2023 was a standout year for PC Games, with major releases like Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Alan Wake II, and the remake of Resident Evil 4 all launching to massive success and critical acclaim, there&#39;s still plenty to look forward to in 2024 - especially with several games and franchises set to receive highly-anticipated sequels. With many games initially announced in 2023 and earlier years set to finally be released in 2024, the year is set to receive a lineup of games on par with the releases of the previous year.
While console exclusives are still prominent, especially on platforms like the Switch and PlayStation, more games than ever before are now receiving simultaneous releases on PC, including those from franchises that have traditionally not released on Steam or Windows, like the Persona series. Even some console exclusives, such as God of War, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, and Horizon Zero Dawn have been delayed on the platform. And with several previously announced games set to finally launch in 2024, there&#39;s plenty to look forward to for those who use PC as their main gaming platform.

Despite the initial reveal trailer for Hades II being presented at The Game Awards near the end of 2022, the game saw little in terms of further news for the majority of 2023 until an update from developer Supergiant Games confirmed that the game would be launching in Early Access in the second quarter of 2024. Marking the first time that Supergiant has made a direct sequel to any of its games, Hades II will feature similar fast-paced action roguelike gameplay to the original, featuring a variety of new characters, enemies, and weapons — including an entirely new protagonist in the Underworld princess Melinoë.

Since its initial reveal, ZZZ has held two invitation-based beta tests, one in 2022 and another in 2023, and released a number of promotional videos on the game&#39;s YouTube channel highlighting the specific gameplay and story of several different characters.

A sequel to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has been the subject of a long and troubled development - it was originally announced all the way back in 2010, canceled two years later, and then revived and announced again in 2018. Since then, the game has undergone several more delays, with the Ukrainian developers being impacted by world events, bringing its current planned release date to the first quarter of 2024. Hopefully, for long-time fans of the series, the long-awaited sequel won&#39;t face any more delays.

Featuring significantly upgraded visuals and improved gameplay, Persona 3 Reload follows the same story and gameplay structure as the original, although the game also features an updated English voice cast, featuring voice actors such as Aleks Le, Allegra Clark, and Alejandro Saab. Unfortunately, the remake will be notably missing some features from other versions of Persona 3, like the option to play as a female protagonist.

Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox X/S
        

Black Myth: Wukong, an action soulslike game heavily based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, was initially revealed in 2020 with a brief gameplay video showing off the game&#39;s polished graphics and combat mechanics, quickly gaining it a massive following. Its most recent trailer at the 2023 Game Awards was no less impressive, showing off impressive visuals, imaginative environmental and enemy design, and the game&#39;s final release date of August 20, 2024. Unfortunately, the Black Myth: Wukong has also been the subject of some controversy involving the game&#39;s development studio, Game Science, which has been accused of sexism and misogyny.





 3  Avowed (2024) 
Platforms: PC, Xbox X/S


 







Announced with a reveal trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase of 2020, Avowed is a first-person RPG set in the fantasy world of Eora - the same setting as developer Obsidian&#39;s CRPG series, Pillar of Eternity. With gameplay distinctly similar to RPGs like Bethesda&#39;s Elder Scrolls series, Avowed promises a similar level of customization and player choice and should offer interesting storylines for those who previously played Pillars of Eternity. However, as of the game&#39;s most recent trailer in 2023, it&#39;s still lacking a concrete release date and is only confirmed to be launching sometime in 2024.

An upcoming Star Wars game from Ubisoft, Star Wars Outlaws was revealed at the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase with a cinematic trailer and a brief gameplay walkthrough, showing off gameplay segments based around on-foot shootouts and ship-based space traversal. Notably, the game focuses on a less-explored part of the Star Wars franchise, heavily featuring criminal syndicates and outlaw protagonist Kay Vess. Like Avowed, Outlaws has yet to receive a concrete release date, only being confirmed for 2024 as of its most recent trailer.
