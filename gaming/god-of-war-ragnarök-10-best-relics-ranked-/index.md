## Literature Review

Relics are an important part of combat in God of War: Ragnarök. These, including Hilt Of Hrotti and Glaive Of Dødher, are some of the most useful.




God of War Ragnarok&#39;s combat demands players bring their best, and an important factor in doing so is learning which Relics make Kratos the most powerful. Relics give Kratos abilities to use in the midst of battle, providing a perfect way to press advantages or turn the tide when Kratos needs it most. These may be offensive, defensive, buffing, or healing. Every Relic brings something to the table, but there are certain Relics that should be prioritized over others in the interest of optimizing gameplay and making Kratos as strong as he can be.
Relics operate on long cooldowns, but the usefulness of their varied effects makes them very worthwhile. These cooldowns can be reduced by certain perks available in the Valhalla DLC, but unfortunately, those don&#39;t apply to the base game as well. Still, these are great abilities to use in tandem with the best Runic Attacks in God of War Ragnarokto help quickly overwhelm whatever enemy or boss Kratos is facing. Whether just trying to clear the game, or just to optimize their loadout for difficult challenges like God of War Ragnarok&#39;s Burdens of Valhalla, knowing the bestRelics will give players the edge that they need.
            
 
 God of War: Ragnarök - Best Early Relic Attacks To Use 
Relic Attacks unleash powerful special moves in God of War: Ragnarök that are extremely helpful in the early stages of dynamic combat with Kratos.












 








 10  Motsognir&#39;s Call Provides A Stunning AoE 
Unlocked In The Post-Game Niflheim Path
        

Motsognir&#39;s Call allows Kratos to create a shockwave that deals high Stun to surrounding enemies. This is a great tactic to use against a horde of enemies surrounding the player, and activating it will give Kratos the necessary time to deal brutal damage to them.
Kratos often has to face large enemy groups in the game. One regular enemy by itself may not be particularly challenging, but ten of them swarming Kratos can be overwhelming. Having the ability to deal even the tiniest amount of extra Stun damage to all those enemies at once is very much worth it, and can easily create an opening for Kratos to use a more powerful damaging AoE. This Relic can be obtained on the ground during the God of War Ragnarok post-game in Niflheim when the new path opens up.





 9  The Hilt Of Ridill Creates A High-Damage AoE 
Requires The Crackle of Bilsrinir


 







The Hilt of Ridill is very similar to Motsognir&#39;s Call, but instead of creating a shockwave that deals Stun, the Hilt of Ridill unleashes a wave of Shock that will electrify enemies. This can be used similarly to Motsognir&#39;s Call and is even more effective against a horde of enemies. Better yet, it can be used in tandem with Motsognir&#39;s Call to first immobilize a group of enemies, then hit them for high damage.


To be able to craft this Relic, players will first need to obtain the Crackle of Bilsrinir. This unique item can be earned in one of the best side quests in God of War Ragnarok, the &#34;Animal Instincts&#34; Favor.





 8  The Hilt Of Angrvadall Deals Extra Damage To Stunned Enemies 
Requires A Lore Scroll And Skirnir&#39;s Gambanteinn
        

The Hilt of Angrvadall puts Kratos into a combo in which he slashes forward three waves that deal increased damage against enemies inflicted with Sonic. This is the perfect Relic to use in tandem with the companion character Freya (or Atreus) after she fires several of her Sonic arrows at multiple targets, inflicting them with the status effect and opening the way to additional damage.
It&#39;s an excellent way to maximize Kratos&#39; overall damage alongside his companion&#39;s support. The recipe for this Relic can be obtained during the &#34;Desert Door&#34; Favor, which has some excellent rewards otherwise. However, it requires Skirnir&#39;s Gambanteinn to craft.





 7  The Hilt Of Hofud Lets Kratos Summon Realm Shifts 
Obtained After Beating Heimdall


 







If players use the Hilt of Hofud, then it&#39;s essential for them to equip the Emblem of the Nine Realms alongside it. That&#39;s not only because it&#39;s one of the best enchantments in God of War Ragnarok, but also because it increases all of Kratos&#39; melee damage in Realm Shifts.
While Realm Shifts are rare events to come across normally, the Hilt of Hofud remedies this by allowing Kratos to make his own Realm Shift when he uses the Relic. Players will thankfully obtain this Relic at the same time as they get the Emblem of the Nine Realms, both of which they&#39;ll obtain after they beat the Heimdall boss fight.





 6  The Hilt Of Gram Boosts Kratos&#39; Rage 
Requires Completion Of A Puzzle In Alfheim
        

The Hilt of Gram is a great Relic for players who need a little boost to their Rage, regardless of the specific type they use. In addition to granting Kratos an extra burst of Rage, the Relic will also Stun the surrounding enemies.
While its range is nothing like Motsognir&#39;s Call, two effects are always better than one. However, players should wait to unleash their Rage form until the enemies&#39; Stun wears off, as the extra status effect isn&#39;t much use with the additional attack and defense bonuses provided by Kratos&#39; Rage. This Relic can be found by completing a Twilight Stone puzzle in Alfheim&#39;s Temple of Light.





 5  The Glaive Of Dodher Lets Kratos Inflict Bifrost 
Obtained After Beating Fiske
        

Dealing Bifrost damage in God of War Ragnarok always feels great on the player&#39;s end. It&#39;s usually Kratos who struggles with getting Bifrost off of him, so turning the tables is uniquely satisfying.
With the Glaive Of Dodher, Kratos can throw chakrams of Bifrost and inflict his enemies with Bifrost in one of the best God of War Ragnarok Relic attacks. Not only is it satisfying to use, but it also deals a ton of damage, so this is a great way to take down enemies at a faster rate. This Relic can be obtained by killing the boss Fiske during the &#34;Reckoning&#34; quest.





 4  The Hilt Of Forsbrandr Can Make Kratos Near-Immortal 
Requires All 48 Of Odin&#39;s Ravens
        

The Hilt of Forsbrandr can be obtained during the base game by finding and freeing all Odin&#39;s Ravens in God of War: Ragnarok. While it&#39;s more than decent during the base game, sending enemies flying backward and creating an Unstoppable Aura of protection, it&#39;s even better in the Valhalla DLC.
With the new Relic power-ups created by Valhalla&#39;s perks, particularly Reckless Refresh, Kratos can immediately restore a Relic&#39;s charge when he&#39;s hit while using one. He can use this to chain together protective Auras. That makes this Relic useful not only in getting out of tight spots and creating opportunities to strike, but also to withstand unblockable attacks and otherwise deadly chains of blows. It was previously hindered by how late in the base game it&#39;s unlocked - but with the additional replayability added by Valhalla, that&#39;s no longer a concern.





 3  The Hilt Of Hrotti Reduces Runic Cooldowns 
Obtained By Defeating Three Oath Guards
        

The Hilt of Hrotti is without a doubt one of the best Relics in God of War Ragnarok by a significant margin. This Relic applies a mark to nearby enemies. Attacking these enemies with an arc will reduce the Runic cooldowns of whatever weapon Kratos has equipped.
Additionally, killing one of the marked enemies will give Kratos a Blessing of Runic, which increases all damage Kratos deals with Runic attacks. This hilt can be obtained by killing three Oath Guard bosses in Vanaheim.





 2  The Hilt Of Skofnung Lets Kratos Summon 
        

This Relic is obtained by killing one of the most difficult Berserker bosses in God of War Ragnarök, King Hrolf Kraki. It allows Kratos to harness the power of Berserkers he&#39;s killed by unsheathing their souls as swords.
These soul swords not only damage all of Kratos&#39; surrounding enemies, but also work as a defensive mechanism that keeps opponents at bay for a time. This is one of the most difficult Relics to obtain, but it&#39;s absolutely worth using.





 1  Huldra Project #9 Actually Makes Mimir Useful 
Can Be Purchased From The Dwarven Shop


 







Huldra Project #9 is the best relic in God of War Ragnarok, even if it also happens to be the oddest. Kratos can use Mimir in battle with this Relic by firing a large Bifrost blast from his eyes.
This is far more effective than the Glaive of Dodher, and is vital for players creating a Bifrost build. The Bifrost status effect allows for enemies to be overwhelmed more swiftly, making it useful in any number of situations. This Relic can be forged at the shop as soon as Kratos can begin using Relics.
With the new changes added by the free Valhalla DLC, Relics are more powerful than ever before. Collecting some of the best ones may take a little bit of work, but they can be well worth it in the end. The right set of Relics can make or break a God of War Ragnarökplaythrough.
