# Avatar Frontiers Of Pandora Ending Explained (In Detail)


## SUMMARY 



  Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has a linear narrative with only one scene before the credits roll, making it important to know the ending for the overall story.   The game involves infiltrating an RDA stronghold to stop Mercer&#39;s plans and relies on the help of Teylan, a defected Na&#39;vi character.   The ending wraps up character arcs and themes but leaves room for future conflict and the possibility of Mercer&#39;s return in the connected Avatar franchise films.

## Literature Review

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora wraps its story up in a relatively concise ending, but there are still a lot of moving parts coming together.




Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a big adventure, and seeing it through to the ending could take some time. Since the game is part of a larger canon, it&#39;s not particularly surprising that there&#39;s only one scene that will play before the credits roll, with no general focus on specific story choices or branching paths throughout. Even for those who don&#39;t end up playing the game, knowing how it leaves things at the end could be useful for keeping up with the overall story unfolding on Pandora across the films and other media.




The plot of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora takes place on the new continent of the Western Frontier, telling the story of a Na&#39;vi of the Sarentu clan raised by the RDA who begins a journey to rediscover their heritage and homeland. Although there&#39;s not a consistent focus on a villain in the way that Ubisoft&#39;s Far Cry series employs, the threat of an RDA big bad named John Mercer looms throughout. The trauma that he inflicted on the past lives of central Na&#39;vi characters plays a supporting role in the looming threat of his current plans, and everything comes to a head as the game reaches its climax and conclusion.

                  &#34;A Staggering Sensory Experience&#34; - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.   


 Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Puts Teylan To The Test 
          




The final mission of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora follows Fary Cry fashion with a base infiltration, building on the pattern established throughout the game, and the protagonist is tasked with breaking into a huge RDA stronghold to stop Mercer&#39;s plans. At this point in the story, it&#39;s become clear that he&#39;s readying a charge to be shot underground that could functionally tear Pandora asunder, so shutting this down at any cost becomes the prerogative. Actually doing so, however, is a complicated process. The only way to get in is through an underground passage that may not actually be safe, as the base is otherwise too well-defended.

The building plans that revealed the existence of the natural passage fell into resistance hands courtesy of Teylan, a young Sarentu Na&#39;vi raised by the RDA who has defected back to Mercer out of fear and confusion. The protagonist, however, trusts Teylan, and without any other options, the plan is a go. The hangar that the passage opens upon turns out to be full of hostile RDA units, throwing Teylan&#39;s loyalty into doubt, but he shocks the exoskeletal AMP suits to help the protagonist out and insists that he thought the hangar would be clear.

Progressing through the base brings its fair share of trials, and the protagonist comes face to face with Mercer through glass at one point, who taunts them and reiterates how their efforts are doomed to fail. Reaching the charge sets up a gameplay sequence that makes it possible to disable the launching mechanism. This isn&#39;t the end, however, as Mercer says that he can still detonate it where it is, which is already far enough underground for Mercer to get the oil he desires. He deploys a powerful mech unit against the protagonist, setting up something like a boss encounter to be handled before escaping the area.

Rather than leaving the base, the protagonist chooses to raise the charge and then rescue Teylan before it goes off. Teylan&#39;s loyalties are tested for the last time in the final encounter with the villain. Mercer controls a robotic arm that pins the protagonist down and then commands Teylan to lower the charge again. Teylan moves to obey, but hesitates when the protagonist starts singing a Na&#39;vi song and ends up controlling the arm to pin Mercer to the wall instead. As explosions go off around the heavily sabotaged base, Teylan and the protagonist run for a helicopter.

The final moments in the base are dicey, with Teylan making it aboard the copter while the protagonist fails to reach it in time. while the protagonist leaps off a ledge before their flying Ikran swoops in to save them. The screen fades to black as they fly off before transitioning to a scene where they land at a cliffside with Na&#39;vi and their Resistance compatriots.

Teylan approaches another one of the Sarentu raised by the RDA, Ri&#39;neli, and says nervously that she must hate him, but she lays a hand on his shoulder reassuringly. After another fade to black, a conversation begins celebrating the victory over Mercer while calling attention to the fact that the RDA as a whole remains a looming threat. Alma, who taught the children in the RDA and was involved in their original kidnapping, tries to establish herself as one of them, but the Sarentu rebuffs her and establishes that it&#39;s time for them to go their own way.



Alma&#39;s attempts to position herself as a direct part of the Sarentu&#39;s struggle are a continual theme throughout the game as they grow apart from her and understand the failings of her complicity.




Ri&#39;nela does offer a gesture of forgiveness, saying that the Sarentu won&#39;t let the past define them, and they will always welcome allies. Each of them make the Na&#39;vi gesture that represents the loaded concept of &#34;seeing&#34; another person, and Alma makes it in return. The Sarentu then walk toward the edge of the cliff, look out upon it, and affirm their own future and their ability to shape it together. An Ikran flies in from above and off into the sky, and Teylan places his hand upon Ri&#39;neli as the camera pans up slightly before the credits roll.

The ending ties up important character threads and themes from the story of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, but it leaves things fairly open-ended overall. Mercer essentially dies off-screen in an explosion, so it&#39;s always possible that he could come back in some way in the future. The overall fight for Pandora&#39;s future will certainly rage on, as any resolution to that conflict will ultimately be hashed out in the connected Avatar franchise films. A Season Pass that will include a couple of expansions is available for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, although whether the story will continue in a sequel remains to be seen.
