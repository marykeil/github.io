## Literature Review

There are a total of 11 Legendary armor sets in Horizon Forbidden Shores, including those from the Burning Shores DLC. How does each chalk up?




If players are going to survive the dangers and enemies of Horizon Forbidden West, it pays to know which Legendary armor is best. After all, one of the most significant changes in Horizon Forbidden West from Horizon Zero Dawn is the approach to armor and how it can apply to gameplay. While Zero Dawn had various armor sets ranging from light to heavy and adept to master, the priority was always stats with the highest numbers. The same is far from true in Forbidden West, wherein players are free to experiment with whichever Legendary armor sets they feel best suit their unique playstyle.
The Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores DLC, which was released in April 2023, introduced five new Legendary armor sets into the game, bringing the total up to 11. Of course, the massive expansion didn&#39;t only include a wardrobe change for Aloy; a fresh area to explore, a new cast of characters (and enemies), exciting quests, and even a potential love interest spruced up the base game considerably. However, it&#39;s hard to deny that the Legendary armor sets in Burning Shores are some of the best upgrades to Horizon Forbidden West.
            
 
 Horizon Forbidden West: Every Legendary Weapon, Ranked (Including DLC) 
Horizon Forbidden West features a select number of legendary weapons to equip Aloy with, with a few in particular standing out as the best.












 








 11  The Nora Lookout Armor Set Is Only Useful In Certain Situations 
Available At The Fleet&#39;s End Stitcher In The Burning Shores DLC
        

Visually, the Nora Lookout armor from Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores may be the best-looking set, due to its clear inspiration from Horizon Zero Dawn&#39;s version of Aloy. Unfortunately, what the outfit has in nostalgia, it lacks in power. It grants the player buffs in powers such as Low Health Regen and Medicine Capacity - which aren&#39;t necessarily bad to have around - but as defensive skills, their value is highly situational.
The Nora Lookout set only makes itself useful at times when Aloy has made a mistake and taken damage, which makes it the worst Legendary armor set in Horizon Forbidden West. Still, it can be handy in the earliest chapters of the DLC, when players are still getting used to the new machines introduced by Burning Shores. Those who want the armor can unlock it for 2,000 Metal Shards and eight Brimshine at the Stitcher in Fleet&#39;s End.





 10  The Quen Deadeye Armor Set Is Good For Stealth Builds 
Requires Completion Of &#34;The Splinter Within&#34; In The Burning Shores DLC
        

The Quen Deadeye set is a great Legendary armor in Horizon Forbidden West&#39;s Burning Shores DLC, at least for those who enjoy a slower, stealthier playstyle. The outfit grants Aloy additional points in Low Profile, Concentration, Stealth Tear, and Stealth Ranged, which will certainly be a welcome upgrade for stealth archer builds. However, players that prefer to go in guns blazing may struggle to make use of the Quen Deadeye set. It can be earned by completing &#34;The Splinter Within&#34; quest in Burning Shores.





 9  The Carja Stalker Elite Armor Set Is Good For Trapper Builds 
Available At The Maw Of The Arena Prize Master
        

An armor that underlines the Carja&#39;s love of fashion as much as protection, the Carja Stalker Elite armor is for players that lean towards a trapping playstyle in Horizon Forbidden West. Not only does the armor increase the trap limit and how quickly traps are placed, but it can also be used in a stealth capacity, along with powers like Low Profile and Quiet Movement, to create a significant advantage before a battle even begins.
However, since trapping is usually reserved for before engaging with the enemy, most of the armor&#39;s skills become unusable during a fight. The Carja Stalker Elite armor set can be found at The Maw of the Arena and is priced at 54 Arena Medals. Arena Medals can be earned by completing Arena challenges, after which they may be turned into the nearby Prize Master in exchange for a wide variety of loot (including three Legendary Armor sets).





 8  The Utaru Winterweave Armor Set Is Even Better For Stealth Builds 
Available At The Thornmarsh Stitcher
        

The Utaru Winterweave is the best Legendary armor set for a stealth build in Horizon Forbidden West. Most of the outfit&#39;s skills revolve around assassinating enemies quickly and efficiently. As such, this armor is the go-to for stealthy players, with innate skills like Quiet Spear, Quiet Movement, and Low Profile.
When fully upgraded, the Utaru Winterweave has more stealth damage (with Silent Strike&#43;) and some life-steal (with the Silent Strike Heal skill). While the armor is excellent for clearing out rebel bases and wiping out the smaller machines, it&#39;s not made for prolonged battles, especially against the larger machines.The Utaru Winterweave armor set is found at the outfit vendor in Thornmarsh, and costs 2,000 metal shards, one Tremortusk Circulator, and one Apex Dreadwing heart.

This view in the Burning Shores DLC is both visually mesmerizing and a remarkable show of technology - yet some players might overlook it entirely.








 7  The Tenakth Tactician Armor Set Is Ideal For Overriding Machines 
Available At The Thornmarsh Stitcher
        

The Tenakth Tactician armor is for players who utilize machines less like mounts in Horizon Forbidden West, and more like allies to help in battle. The armor set&#39;s skills revolve around increasing an overridden machine&#39;s health, damage, and elemental capabilities, making even the lowly Burrower a tremendous combat asset. However, the armor&#39;s greatest strength is also its biggest downside in battle.
On the one hand, the armor considerably buffs machines and how long they stay overridden. On the other hand, this focus on machines doesn&#39;t leave much room for players to build on their damage. While this can be mitigated with outfit weaves or weapon mods, Aloy&#39;s total damage potential will always be lower than it could be. Regardless, players can seek out thisForbidden West armor in the Thornmarsh settlement, where it costs 2,000 metal shards, one Thunderjaw circulator, and one Apex Slitherfang heart.





 6  The Quen Commander Armor Set Is Good For Melee Builds 
Available At The Fleet&#39;s End Stitcher In The Burning Shores DLC
        

The Quen Commander outfit is one of the best Legendary armors in Burning Shores, and it&#39;s fun to use, as it&#39;s catered towards a close-range combat style. As such, those who prefer to get up close and personal with the new machines in Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores will be glad to know that this Warrior category set provides Aloy with an abundance of perks, mostly focused on improving her Resonator Blast. These skills increase the charging rate, duration, and damage of bow attacks performed after a string of melee strikes. The Armor can be purchased for 2,000 Metal Shards and eight Brimshine from the Stitcher in Fleet&#39;s End.

One aspect of Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores&#39; story has spawned a slew of hateful reviews, which only proves that it&#39;s not done often enough.








 5  The Blacktide Quen Commander Armor Set Is More Fashionable 
Available From The Fleet&#39;s End Stitcher With A Pre-Order Of The Burning Shores DLC
        

The Blacktide Quen Commander set is functionally identical to the Quen Commander set, but instead features a stylish black-and-gold color scheme. As far as the best Legendary armor in Horizon Forbidden West goes, choosing between the two simply comes down to the player&#39;s taste in fashion, as well as how they purchased the Burning Shores DLC. Players who pre-ordered Burning Shores can claim the armor for a single Metal Shard from the Stitcher in Fleet&#39;s End.





 4  The Tenakth Vanquisher Armor Set Can Keep Aloy Alive 
Available At The Maw Of The Arena Prize Master
        

The Tenakth Vanquisher armor caters to a high-risk, high-reward playstyle in Horizon Forbidden West. Aloy must be in a constant state of low health to use most of the armor&#39;s skills: increased valor, melee, defense, and ranged capabilities are unleashed when her HP is down. Fortunately, the armor has some survival viability with the Second Chance mod, which boosts players&#39; chances of surviving a killing blow. While the armor has high damage potential, it&#39;s ultimately a niche pick that depends on the player&#39;s build and playstyle. Horizon Forbidden West&#39;s Tenakth Vanquisher armor is one of three Legendary sets unlocked at The Maw of the Arena for 54 arena medals.





 3  The Oseram Artificer Armor Set Is Ideal For Melee Builds 
Requires Completion Of All Salvage Contracts


 







The Oseram Artificer is the best Legendary armor to take advantage of Aloy&#39;s revamped spear. This set has the highest melee stats in the game when fully upgraded. Plus, it harbors skills that boost melee and power attacks, all while buffing resonator buildup and how long enemies stay energized.
However, the Oseram Artificer set leans towards a more aggressive playstyle that might not fit every player. The armor is also relatively vulnerable without the Overshield valor surge, especially on higher difficulty modes, diminishing the player&#39;s combat options. The Oseram Artificer armor is only given to the player after completing all 17 salvage contracts across the Forbidden West, making it the set that takes the longest to obtain in Horizon Forbidden West.





 2  The Quen Marine Armor Set Is Perfect For Balanced Builds 
Available At The Fleet&#39;s End Stitcher In The Burning Shores DLC


 







The best Legendary armor to come out of the Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores DLC is the Quen Marine set. It&#39;s in the Infiltrator category, and so it&#39;s best used while lurking in the shadows - but doing so isn&#39;t absolutely necessary to make use of its game-changing perks. The Quen Marine armor imbues the player with extra points in Stamina Regen and Concentration, which can make a battle with even the toughest of bosses far more manageable. It can be purchased for 2,000 Metal Shards and eight Brimshine from the Stitcher in Fleet&#39;s end.





 1  The Nora Thunder Warrior Armor Set Is The Best In Horizon Forbidden West 
Available At The Maw Of The Arena Prize Master


 







The Nora Thunder Warrior set is still the best Legendary armor in Horizon Forbidden West. This outfit is ranged-focused, granting the highest impact damage among the Legendary armors while massively buffing concentration. It&#39;s also highly flexible in battle, with skills lending an advantage toward stamina regeneration, increasing how many times the player can dodge, and Heavy Weapon&#43; buffing two-handed weapons even further.
The damage potential increases further when this armor is combined with weapons like The Death-Seeker&#39;s Shadow or the Forgefall. In order to earn the best Legendary armor in Horizon Forbidden West, The Nora Thunder Warrior set, players will need to fight at The Maw of the Arena and pay 54 arena medals.
