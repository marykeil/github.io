## Literature Review

Sunday, November 4th has a brand new Wordle to solve and with these hints, today&#39;s answer shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for most players.





There are plenty of other Wordle copycat games that exist if you&#39;re looking for more challenges for the day. One of the more popular ones is Quordle which increases the difficulty of the original game by forcing players to solve multiple Wordle words at the exact same time. Players will share answers between four different puzzles in hopes of solving all of them before running out of chances.

Today&#39;s Wordle answer is FLARE.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE, this provided a few hints including the correct places for both vowels. Moving the &#39;R&#39; around we attempted CHARE as our second guess. This easily locked in the &#39;R&#39; and set us on the correct path to victory.

For our third attempt, we tried SPARE which proved incorrect and only added letters to the unused pile. Finally, with a little luck, we hit a Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer, FLARE. Another fairly easy puzzle down and on to the next day!
