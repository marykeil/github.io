## Literature Review

There are several bosses in Persona 5 Tactica, the second of which is Yoshiki. Uniquely, this boss hangs back and makes the party come to him.





Whereas Marie took on the party headfirst, Yoshiki will hang back initially in each phase and let other enemies engage the party first. Conserving SP is going to be imperative early on, as players will have to utilize the same three party members for the duration of all three phases of this fight.




                  &#34;Another Fun Spin-Off That Proves The Depth Of Its Source Material&#34;: Persona 5 Tactica Review   Persona 5 Tactica strikes a balance between XCOM-style tactical gameplay and the cozy, social dynamics of P5, making for a fun journey.   


 How To Beat Yoshiki 
         

Phase One: Ride The Elevator
Since Yoshiki has decided to place himself out of reach, every phase will begin with attempting to get closer. Take care of the surrounding enemies while conserving SP, and get the entire party over to the square elevator platform before pressing the button to raise it. If any party members miss the first one, a second will be lower, which can be raised similarly. Once it is Yoshiki&#39;s turn, he will begin with the move Love At First Sight, placing one of the party members in his crosshairs.



Beware that raising one elevator platform effectively lowers the other. Therefore, if planning to raise a Persona 5 Tactica character on one and then use the other elevator to raise the remaining party members, ensure that the initial member already at the top moves off the elevator before the other elevator is raised. Otherwise, they will be lowered back to the bottom.







                  7 Best Skills To Unlock First In Persona 5 Tactica   Choosing the right skills for the right battles is a key part of gameplay in Persona 5 Tactica, and players will learn how to choose wisely.   

Once at the top, work on the surrounding enemies. When it is Yoshiki&#39;s turn again, he will use Sending You My Love, firing upon the party member targeted by his previous move. The Emblem of Love will create an area of yellow tiles, marking a danger zone for party members, so stay far away from the indicated area. The party still will need to be closer to reach Yoshiki, but there&#39;s another elevator at the base of his location, so ride an elevator back down to reach it. Once you&#39;ve reached Yoshiki, use a gun to attack him and initiate phase two.

Phase Two: Avoid The Cameras
          




Security Cameras will now be introduced into the fight and should be avoided at all costs. Triggering them will cause Yoshiki to knock you back and send out additional reinforcements. While trying to extend the use of personas in Persona 5 Tactica by sparing SP, also be careful if using melee attacks. If the enemy is in view of a camera, using a melee attack will cause the party member to enter the camera&#39;s view, and yes, that counts as being spotted. Aside from that, the general idea is the same as Phase One. Simply use the alternating elevators to reach Yoshiki and fire upon him again to enter Phase Three.

Phase Three: Wait For Reinforcements
         

Phase Three will look slightly different as there now appears to be a direct path straight to Yoshiki, but don&#39;t be fooled. Enemies and security cameras will be blocking the way, so focus on steadily working your way over there. It&#39;s best to leave one party member near the back of that center aisle while sending the other two up around the left. After some progress has been made, reinforcements will arrive to take out the cameras blocking your way, allowing you to reach Yoshiki.




The boss fight will conclude after reaching and firing upon Yoshiki for the final time. A few scenes involving Toshiro and the entire party will play out to conclude the Kingdom and develop the story. Then, the party will be ready to move on and proceed with the rest of what awaits them in Persona 5 Tactica, including even more challenging boss fights.
