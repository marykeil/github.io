## Literature Review

Sometimes, Hunter Blinds and Hunter Bases missions don’t show up on the map in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Here’s how to fix that, and what to do after.




Hunter Blinds don&#39;t always show up on the map in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. These are some of the most enjoyable side missions in the game: Kraven and his cronies have set up bases of operation throughout the city, and it&#39;s up to Miles and Peter to find them, collect their intel, and shut them down. There are 14 Hunter Blinds in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, with two or three in each neighborhood where they appear. Once the player clears out an entire district&#39;s worth of Blinds, they&#39;ll unlock a new Hunter Base, which is like a larger, more complicated version of the same kind of activity.




Hunter Blinds can be incredibly rewarding. Each one grants XP, Tech Parts, and Rare Tech parts, with even better unique rewards for destroying all the bases. But unlike other collectibles and side missions, like the Mysterium Challenges in Spider-Man 2, Hunter Blinds aren&#39;t so easy to find. Certain conditions must be satisfied in order to unlock each set, and the game doesn&#39;t make it totally clear what exactly those conditions are. Here&#39;s what players need to know.

 How To Unlock More Hunter Blinds In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
          

Players must progress through the main story to unlock more Hunter Blinds in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, with certain missions unlocking a new set of Hunter Blinds to track down and complete. This is probably related to pacing the difficulty of these missions throughout the game, ensuring players don&#39;t get stuck on too-difficult Hunter Blinds too early in the game.




As a result, Hunter Blinds work different from most other collectibles in the game. Only Hunter Blinds and EMF Experiments in Spider-Man 2 are locked behind progression. Each EMF Experiment is unlocked by completing the previous set, while each set of Hunter Blinds is unlocked during the story. Players must also complete the entire main story to unlock the last EMF Experiment.

The first set of three Hunter Blinds is unlocked after the main story quest &#34;Bad Guys on the Block.&#34; There are three in each district where Hunter Blinds are located, with one exception - Downtown Brooklyn only has two. The first three, the Motorpool Blinds, are located in Harlem. A red map icon depicting a pair of crossed swords will appear on each one. Players can then progress through the story until they unlock the Arsenal Blinds on the Upper West Side, the Garden Blinds in the Financial District, and finally, the two Aviary Blinds in Downtown Brooklyn.

Each time players unlock more Hunter Blinds, they&#39;ll see an on-screen popup that says as much, so don&#39;t worry about missing them. It&#39;s also worth noting that Hunter Blinds are unmissable, and can be completed throughout the entire game, even after beating the main story of Spider-Man 2. There&#39;s no need to rush through them or complete them by a certain point, so players are encouraged to take as much time as they like to complete the Hunter Blinds.






 How To Complete Hunter Blinds In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
         

After unlocking a new set, players must find each Hunter Blind&#39;s location in Spider-Man 2. They tend to be easily found, as they&#39;re all located on the rooftops of the marked buildings. They&#39;re also simple to complete: just show up, knock out all the enemies, and activate a nearby drone to proceed. However, there are a couple of wrinkles that can make these side quests difficult. Some of them have unique challenges, like laser mazes that Spider-Man will have to navigate. And if Kraven&#39;s hunters are made aware of his presence, they&#39;re able to call for backup. As a result, it&#39;s best to use stealth when clearing out Hunter Blinds.



While both Miles and Peter are able to complete Hunter Blind missions, it&#39;s best to undertake them as Miles. His ability to turn invisible makes stealth much easier, which means enemies are less likely to call in backup.







Hunter Bases, however, are just a little more complicated. Each one involves a series of tasks, some of which are optional, and some of which are required for completion. Destroying Hunter Blinds reveals more of these vulnerabilities, which can be exploited for an easier time taking down the Bases. For example, Hunter Bases might require Spider-Man to destroy Kraven&#39;s infrastructure to interrupt the baddies&#39; activities, or download data off one of their terminals to gather more intel.

It&#39;s recommended that, as soon as he arrives at a Hunter Base, Spider-Man should turn off its communications console. This will prevent enemies from calling for help even if he&#39;s seen, ensuring a quicker and easier fight. With that done, completing a Hunter Base is nearly identical to completing a Hunter Blind. It&#39;s as simple as KO&#39;ing everyone in the area, then interacting with the computer to turn in the mission. Once it&#39;s all done, players will have to return to the main story to unlock the next set of Hunter Blinds.






 Rewards For Hunter Blinds And Bases In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
          

Hunter Blinds and Hunter Bases each come with a variety of rewards. While each individual one provides the same rewards as all the others of the same type, there are two unique rewards for completing all of them: suits for Miles and Peter. Each Hunter Blind rewards 1,000 XP, 150 Tech Parts, and five Rare Tech Parts. Each Hunter Base rewards 1,500 XP, 350 Tech Parts, and another five Rare Tech Parts.

Completing all 14 Hunter Blinds and five Hunter Bases unlocks the Most Dangerous Game suit for miles, and the Last Hunt suit for Peter. These are each one of 39 suits available for their respective characters. They&#39;re both inspired by Kraven, with fur-lined collars and naturally colored materials to reflect the hunter&#39;s penchant for collecting pelts.




Hunter Blinds and Hunter Bases comprise a nice little side activity. They&#39;re quick and fun to complete, and their unique sub-objectives ensure they&#39;re anything but repetitive. Plus, they have some truly worthwhile rewards. However, it&#39;s not worth rushing through Hunter Blinds, since they can only be unlocked during the story and will remain available for the rest of the game. As a result, these side activities are best enjoyed slowly, as they become available during the campaign of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.
