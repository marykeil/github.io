## Literature Review

Grand Theft Auto 6 could learn a lot from Red Dead Redemption 2, but one feature in particular could offer the most far-reaching benefits.




Grand Theft Auto 6 is likely to provide a very different experience from Red Dead Redemption 2, but one key feature in the Western epic from Rockstar Games could be the perfect addition to the GTA series. Although Grand Theft Auto 5 was a huge success, Red Dead Redemption 2 arguably raised the bar for open-world games yet again, utilizing all of Rockstar&#39;s experience and expanding on the best features of the company&#39;s approach. There&#39;s no reason that GTA 6 shouldn&#39;t look to Arthur Morgan&#39;s adventures for inspiration, and doing so could make its story better than ever.




One feature of Red Dead Redemption 2 that stands out from most open-world games is the strength of its characterization. The primary protagonists are compelling and rich individuals, but even more minor NPCs offer plenty of engaging encounters and interesting perspectives. While it&#39;s not uncommon for dialogue to feel like a drag in AAA games, Red Dead Redemption 2 manages to make the idea of seeking out conversation actively appealing. To this end, the game offers an easy method of building relationships and hanging out with acquaintances through the camp system.

                  You Might Want To Lower Your Expectations For GTA 6   Grand Theft Auto 6 has built up an enormous amount of excitement, but tempering expectations is more likely to pay long-term dividends.   


 GTA 6 Needs To Steal Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s Camp 
RDR2 Has The Perfect Storytelling System
         




Striking up a fire and pitching tents might not exactly be at home in Grand Theft Auto 6, but translating the general idea of the camp system from Red Dead Redemption 2 would be to the game&#39;s enormous benefit. The Grand Theft Auto series has always done a good job of cultivating a colorful cast of characters, but it can be hard to find a way to center some of the more eccentric ones in the narrative. The camp system makes it easy to gather the most fascinating individuals of the criminal persuasion in one place, ensuring a solid foundation for memorable relationships.

Building close ties between interesting characters is one of the best features of peak Grand Theft Auto, but GTA 5 didn&#39;t quite meet the highest bar that the series has set in this regard. Following several distinct protagonists whose paths didn&#39;t heavily cross for much of the game fractured some of the sense of a central identity, even though memorable side characters appeared throughout. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a great example of how much a central group like the Grove Street Families can add when it receives a primary focus, and the camp system could be great for this kind of story.




                  10 Lessons GTA 6 Can Learn From Red Dead Redemption 2   GTA 6 doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it should borrow heavily from and improve on the Rockstar games before it. Here’s what it can take from RDR 2.   



 A Camp Would Make The World Of GTA6 Richer 
Grand Theft Auto Needs Some Grounding
          

The camp in Red Dead Redemption 2 was also an excellent way to show off how the lives of characters extended beyond their most direct interactions with Arthur, revealing arcs and behaviors that helped to make them feel like robust human beings. Focusing in on these small details could help the world of Grand Theft Auto 6 feel real, especially considering how many buildings in a giant city are likely to be nothing more than facades. Grand Theft Auto might get plenty of laughs from broad satire and absurd behavior, but creating authenticity helps ensure that the sillier elements don&#39;t wear thin.




Recent years have shown just how effective emotional storytelling in video games can be, with major AAA titles like God of War attempting to bring more gravity to over-the-top god-slaying, and there&#39;s no reason that Grand Theft Auto 6 shouldn&#39;t mine a little more than GTA 5 did in this regard. Grand Theft Auto 4 is still fondly remembered for its more grounded and compelling story, a standard that could be to GTA 6&#39;s benefit as well. Following Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s model would be the easiest way to incorporate these aspects into Grand Theft Auto 6, as it already fits perfectly into Rockstar&#39;s method of building an open world.

                  GTA 6 Release Date Leaks &amp; Rumors - Everything Confirmed &amp; Debunked (So Far)   GTA 6 is one of the most hotly-anticipated games in recent memory, but with Rockstar remaining quiet, there&#39;s lots of release date rumors to explore.   



 How RDR2&#39;s Camp Could Work In Grand Theft Auto 6 
A Camp Could Be The Key To A GTA6 Criminal Empire
          




Translating the flavor of RDR2 camps to the world of GTA 6 wouldn&#39;t be particularly hard. From a run-down warehouse to criminal turf like Grove Street, there are plenty of locations that could make a good base of operations in the city. Although a butcher wouldn&#39;t be likely to wrangle fresh meat in a GTA 6 camp, gamblers, arms dealers, and more could easily set up some useful or fun services. The upgrade system could be significantly expanded from its implementation in Red Dead Redemption 2, potentially tying into the overall building of a criminal empire.

There&#39;s certainly a balancing act to be found here, as turning GTA 6 into a management game would obviously distract from its most distinct pleasures. Ideally, its translation of a camp system could offer as little or as much distraction as a player would want. Upgrading features and potentially recruiting members to a gang or organization should provide perks, but nothing that would be required to have a fun or balanced experience with the game as a whole. It&#39;s doubtful that this will be much of a concern, however, as RDR2 shows how good Rockstar is at juggling diverse gameplay elements.




                  There&#39;s One Very Obvious December Date For GTA 6&#39;s Trailer Release   A tweet from Rockstar confirming GTA 6&#39;s soon-to-be-released trailer has fans speculating just when they will get their first glimpse at the next GTA.   



 Grand Theft Auto 6 Camp Would Reward Gameplay 
Crime Doesn&#39;t Pay, Except In GTA6
          

Investing in aspects of a camp system could also provide extra incentivization for committing crimes, which is, after all, the whole point of a game called Grand Theft Auto. Buying vehicles, guns, and clothing is always an easy way to keep cash on the move in the GTA series, but stealing cars and weaponry can be just as fun as purchasing them, and money tends to pile up past a certain point regardless. RDR2&#39;s model of rewarding donations is the perfect system to borrow here, extending the value of successful heists beyond their general utility.




Whether a camp system actually appears in GTA 6 or not, RDR2 will certainly have its fair share of influence on the game. This one feature, however, seems like it would be an especially beneficial and exciting one to explore. The story experience of Grand Theft Auto 6 is a big opportunity that could end up under-utilized, and translating the camp system from Red Dead Redemption 2 would be the perfect way to ensure that it doesn&#39;t go to waste.
