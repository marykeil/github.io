## Literature Review

Racing games can fill the need for a speed-filled adrenaline rush or provide laughs with friends. Here are some of the best of the genre out now.




Since the beginning of video games, racing games like Mario Kart and Forza Motorsport have fueled players&#39; need for that special adrenaline rush that comes when flying around corners at high speeds. Without the fear of actual crashes, being able to race cars in video games can be a fantastic way to bond with friends through online and local multiplayer, and they can also give single-player experiences that help take one out of their real-life problems as they enjoy beating the AI drivers, or their previously set times. As technology improves, so does the realism that many of these games take advantage of, although the more stylized titles remain appreciated as well.
Racing games as a genre can cover many different types of play, including hyper-realistic track racing, open-world adventures that can be more of a driving game with races included, or the cartoon kart-race variety that comes from the likes of Mario Kart games. They can use silly go-karts, ferocious monster trucks, sleek race cars, and anything else imaginable. No matter the style, however, there is always the rush that comes from speed and steering a vehicle around those corners, and here are some of the best racing games that are available today.









 








 10  DIRT 5 
Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S
        

The bright and colorful DIRT 5 takes players on an offroad excursion where the name becomes fairly literal with the amount of virtual mud and dust that is kicked up. It is an incredibly fun and engaging game that plays somewhat like an arcade racer through offroad trails in all forms of weather and locations. Whether racing against friends or foes in Multiplayer mode, getting imaginative with the Creation mode, or trying out the game&#39;s Career mode, there is plenty to keep any driver occupied. DIRT 5 was given 4/5 stars in its Screen Rant review and has a Metacritic score of 79.

 Horizon Chase 2 is almost like a love letter to classic arcade racing games of the 1990s. It is more simplistic in design than many of today&#39;s race car experiences, yet that adds to its charm when combined with the bright neon graphics and catchy synth soundtrack.

Rally car races can be fun to watch in real life, and just as much fun to try out in a virtual space through games like EA Sports WRC, which is the official video game of the World Rally Championship for 2023.

For many, the racing genre instills thoughts of classic Formula One racecars flying around a track at impossible speeds. F1 23 gives just that experience to its players through a solo story-driven campaign and multiplayer modes. The series provides annual games that revolve around real-world seasons, and previous years have seen fierce criticism for their heavy focus on microtransactions, which, thankfully, have been reduced for 2023&#39;s entry. Screen Rant&#39;s review gave F1 23 4/5 stars and Metacritic lists an aggregate score of 82.

The recent Gran Turismo movie that was released in 2023 placed a large spotlight on the video game franchise, telling the true story of a player who became a professional race car driver. Before that movie existed, however, Gran Turismo 7 launched in 2022 as one of the quintessential racing game experiences for players to enjoy. In Screen Rant&#39;s review, it is said that &#34;Gran Turismo 7 is also a love letter to motor racing in general&#34; as it has a large variety of vehicles and courses with many different objectives to chase. Screen Rant scored the game at 4/5, with Metacritic listing an incredible score of 87.

Despite being confined to the Nintendo consoles, and certainly not focusing on realism, Mario Kart has always been one of the leading names in racing video games. The classic Nintendo characters and the hilarity and hijinx of items such as banana peels and blue shells hardly need definition in today&#39;s world. Despite being originally released in 2014 with the Deluxe version launching in 2017, Mario Kart 8 has filled the years with updates and new DLC content that has kept it at the front of players&#39; minds. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has a must-play Metacritic score of 92 and is a beloved evergreen game for many virtual drivers.
