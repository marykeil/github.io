## Literature Review

2024 will be a busy year for the Nintendo Switch, with several titles announced for the console over the year including many familiar franchises.




The Nintendo Switch may be well past the normal lifespan for a console, yet judging from the list of games with planned release dates in 2024, it isn&#39;t slowing down just yet. With the beginning of the new year on the horizon, there is already a full catalog of titles coming that include remakes, sequels, and brand-new games.

In 2024, several remakes are planned for fan-favorite titles, including Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 and Mario vs. Donkey Kong, yet there are also many new games planned exclusively for the Nintendo Switch, including Princess Peach: Showtime! and Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. This suggests that the versatile little console may not be ready to hang up its joy-cons just yet. Here are some of the most anticipated titles coming in 2024.
