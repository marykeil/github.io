## Literature Review

Chrysis needs to be eliminated in Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey, but she can be a bit difficult to find if you don&#39;t know where to look.





You will first find Chrysis during the main mission of Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey in the fifth chapter. You will need to locate here during the &#34;Ashes to Ashes&#34; main quest inside a temple. Once you make your way inside the temple, you will get the option to either attack Chrysis or save a baby trapped in the burning temple. It is advised to save the baby first as the other option spoils the questline in its entirety. Once you have saved the baby, Chrysis will escape; however, this won&#39;t be the last time you will see the Kosmos worshipper
