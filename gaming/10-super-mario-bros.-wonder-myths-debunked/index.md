## Literature Review

Many theories are swirling around about wild things some say are in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Here are a few myths that have been debunked. 




With all the magical Wonder Effects that can take place in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, things can get pretty wild just on their own, but with the addition of all the myths and rumors circulating the internet, it can be hard to know what is genuinely part of the game. There are many fun features and abilities that the new power-ups can provide, and the mystical distortions of the Wonder Flower can turn everything upside-down. This makes even some of the most outrageous myths online sound fairly plausible for a game where pretty much anything can happen.
Mario&#39;s latest platforming adventure takes him and his friends into the Flower Kingdom, where Bowser&#39;s corruption has mixed with the land&#39;s natural magical capabilities to create all sorts of havoc that the mustachioed plumber must fix. Some players on the internet have speculated, hypothesized, or even directly stated several things that they claim are possible in the game, which often sound cool but may or may not be true. While there are numerous crazy secrets hidden in this game, there are many myths and assertions, such as the ones listed below, which have ultimately been proven to be false.

 10  False: Walking On Water With The Jet Run Badge 
Jet Run Badge Provides Infinite Running On Land
        

Badges in Super Mario Bros. Wonder can alter basic gameplay mechanics for the characters throughout the level and lasts as long as the badge is equipped in Prince Florian&#39;s hat. The Jet Run Badge gives the ability to have Mario, or whichever character is chosen, run continuously at an extra fast speed without the ability to stop. Characters can still jump, but they are incapable of stopping and standing still. This made the myth of being able to run across the surface of water sound plausible. Sadly, this is false, and even with the Jet Run Badge equipped, as soon as the character hits the water, they simply begin to swim at a slow, normal speed as usual.

 9  False: Yoshi&#39;s Can All Ride Each Other In A Stack 
Four Yoshi&#39;s At The Same Time Doesn&#39;t Work
        

Yoshi is a unique character in Super Mario Bros. Wonder not only because he is an easy-mode option without the ability to die but also because, in multiplayer, other players can ride on Yoshi&#39;s back as he is controlled by someone else. Four Yoshis of differing colors are available, so a full party can enjoy the easy mode stylings together, and one Yoshi can ride on another Yoshi, but they cannot continue to stack. It would certainly be cool and comical to see four Yoshis in a stack riding on one another, but sadly, only one is possible.





 8  False: Fireballs Are Best For Breaking Ice Blocks 
Fire Vs. Ice Makes Sense
        

Logically, it makes perfect sense that using a fireball against an Ice Block would be the most effective way to destroy the block. For whatever reason, however, this theory is incorrect, and it is actually slower to break an Ice Block using fire. Attacking an Ice Block with the Fire Flower&#39;s power takes three hits to destroy it. When using either an Elephant trunk or a simple ground pound attack, only two hits are required.





 7  False: Character Size And Weight Changes Speed Of Puffy Lifts 
Elephant Mario And Toad Are The Same


 







Another myth in Super Mario Bros. Wonder that comes mainly from common sense is that the heavier a character appears, the faster they would lower the Puffy Lifts. Puffy Lifts in the game are giant cloud-like objects that slowly lower when there is any weight from a character or NPC on them and then raise up tall when nothing is on them. Contrary to general supposition, the speed at which the Puffy Lifts lower remains the same whether Elephant Mario, regular Mario, or even a Goomba are on them. The only difference noted is when they are quicker due to being hit with a ground-pound attack.

 6  False: Goombas Can Stack 
When Trapped In A Hole, They All Go In The Hole
        

Speaking of Goombas, one cute detail in Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the way they can sit and look a bit exasperated when they stumble along into a single hole and become stuck. This looks adorable and spawned the myth that, due to the Goomba&#39;s head being the height of the ground, if another Goomba follows, it will stack and create a Goomba Tower. This is a debunked myth, however, as rather than stacking, they will simply all fall into the same hole and create a somewhat glitchy look with the images all in the same spot.





 5  False: The Dolphin Kick Badge Helps In Goo 
Swimming In Goo Is Always Slower
        

Like the Jet Run Badge, the Dolphin Kick Badge is generally designed to make characters faster, in this case, specifically when they are in the water. By clicking the R button while in the water, Mario, or whichever character is being played, will kick their legs and swim faster, gaining a burst of speed.


The above video from Infinite Bits shows that with the Dolphin Kick Badge equipped, pressing R while in the green goo does nothing. While in the water, this would make Mario have little dashes while swimming. In the goo, it is as though they are not pressing anything at all.





 4  False: Elephant Mario Can Get Infinite Coins Watering The Grass 
Even While Standing In A Water Source
        

In the same video from Infinite Bits, he also tackled the myth that players can gain an infinite amount of coins if they have the patience for it by having Elephant Mario stand in a water source and throw water at the grass. Doing this will provide some coins, but it is not an infinite number. The amount of coins a player can get in this manner is capped at the strangely selected number of 45.





 3  False: Multiplayer Ground Pound Creates A POW Effect 
Synchronized Ground Pounding Still Looks Cool Though
        

In other Super Mario multiplayer games such as New Super Mario Bros., there was a fun multiplayer tactic of being able to have all players do a ground-pound simultaneously to create a POW Block effect without the POW Block. This could break objects in the vicinity and even defeat enemies. In Super Mario Bros. Wonder, there was an assumed myth that the same ability would happen, yet despite still looking cool to have a synchronized jump, there is no such effect as a result.

Co-op is a fun way to take on the challenges of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but it&#39;s lacking in one particular regard compared to some past Mario games.








 2  False: Dark Mario Can&#39;t Be Killed 
With Patience He Can Be Defeated


 







Dark Mario is a Mario-like enemy that appears after a certain Wonder Flower effect is triggered, and it will chase players around the level, only disappearing after a Wonder Seed is obtained. Dark Mario will hurt the character if he is able to catch him, and it can make for a difficult challenge. The thought was that Dark Mario was invincible, only being stunned by POW Blocks or Fire Mario fireballs. Actually, if a player has enough patience, Dark Mario can be defeated after being struck with 50 fireballs in a row.





 1  The Mushroom Thing On Toads: Hat Or Head? 
The Ongoing Debate Is Officially Answered


 







One of the biggest controversies in the Super Mario franchise for years has been whether the mushroom on top of Toad&#39;s head is a hat or part of his head. This was further confused after The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! television show included scenes with Toad removing the mushroom as a hat. Despite that, in a loading screen for Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it has been officially confirmed by Nintendo that: &#34;Toads are residents of the Mushroom Kingdom, and those are their heads - not big hats!&#34;
