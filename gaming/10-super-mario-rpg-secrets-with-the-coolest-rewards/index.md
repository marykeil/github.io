## Literature Review

Super Mario RPG is a game full of hidden details and secrets, and many of these offer the player some especially cool rewards for uncovering them.




There are plenty of cool secrets to find in Super Mario RPG, ranging from simple Easter eggs to difficult but rewarding challenges. Searching for secrets like these can be a fun diversion from the main game, especially if grinding to reach Super Mario RPG’s maximum level, but in many cases they also offer extra objectives for people to aim for. Of course, some secret rewards can have a greater impact on gameplay than others, but finding them all can still provide many fun experiences regardless.

Super Mario RPG is full of fun battles, character interactions, and more, many of which are not even necessary to complete the main game. Instead, the game offers a near-endless array of fun for those who want to explore its world to the fullest. There are side quests that offer no reward at all apart from the sense of a job well done, a multitude of fun minigames to play, and, of course, many other hidden bonuses and rewards. Nevertheless, some secrets naturally stand out more than others, and these are some of the best.









 








 10  Grate Guy’s Casino 
Playing For Valuable Prizes


 







Finding Grate Guy’s Casino takes time, but it is worth the effort. Scoring 12 points in Knife Guy’s juggling game in Booster Tower rewards Mario with a Bright Card, which provides access to the casino Casino. The Casino itself can be found by following hints given by a Toad in the Nimbus Land inn to find a hidden platform underground in Bean Valley. The Casino itself offers three minigames to play, all with their own prizes. Most notably, winning ‘Look the other way’ 100 times will earn Mario the Star Egg, a reusable item that deals 100 damage to all enemies.





 9  Secret Ending Firework Shapes 
Alternate Graphics For Dedicated Players
        

Part of the ending credits to Super Mario RPG features a beautiful fireworks display, but even the very end of the game can hold a surprise. While these fireworks will generally burst into the iconic shape of a Mushroom, it is actually possible to change this by buying fireworks in Moletown. If there are three or four Fireworks in the inventory at this point in the game, the display becomes a Fire Flower, and five or more will transform it once more into a Super Star shape. While only cosmetic, this provides a fun extra flair to the game’s conclusion.







 8  Dream Cushion’s Secret Dream 
A Rewarding Nightmare For Mario
        

The Dream Cushion is an item that can be bought at the Nimbus Land inn for an extra 30 coins, double the regular fee to rest there. Opting to use the Dream Cushion will lead to Mario having a random dream during his sleep, one of which involves a Toad revealing himself to be a Greaper. When Mario wakes up, the real Toad in the inn will give him a very useful invincibility-granting Red Essence, a perfect item to have on hand during particularly tough encounters.
Even with the Cloud Cushion dreams being randomized, using the nearby Save Block before resting means the cost of finding the Red Essence can be kept to 60 coins. 






 7  Booster Hill Flowers 
An FP Boost Under Unusual Circumstances
        

After chasing Booster and Princess Peach, Booster Hill is home to the Beetle Chase minigame, which requires a Beetle Box from Beatles are Us in Seaside Town. However, Mario can actually play this minigame without the item, with notably different results. Although doing so prevents Mario from collecting valuable Beetles, if people try to play the game anyway, a maximum of six Flowers will become available to collect, with any missed Flowers remaining present for subsequent attempts. This makes for a valuable addition to the FP pool, making a supposedly unprepared extra trip up Booster Hill well worth it.





 6  Beetle Mania 
A Hidden Classic-Style Minigame
        

In the Mushroom Kingdom’s inn, a young Toad can be found playing a handheld game, Beetle Mania. After recruiting Princess Peach, if this Toad is spoken to enough times, he will become annoyed and offer to sell Mario the game for 500 coins. If Mario agrees, then Beetle Mania can then be played from the menu. It is a relatively simple game, placing the player in control of a beetle that shoots down Koopa Shells for points. There are no special rewards for doing well, but the arcade-style minigame game is entertaining enough by itself.

 5  Feeding Yoshi For Items 
Rewards For Giving Away Free Food


 







After completing Marrymore and beating Boshi in a race, a baby Yoshi can be found in a nest on Yo’ster Isle. This Yoshi can be fed Yoshi Cookies, requiring 30 to grow into a notably plump adult. Then, when fed either 10 or 20 cookies at once, this Yoshi will give Mario a random selection from a variety of useful items, including Red Essences and Yoshi-Ade, which boosts both a party member’s attack and defense at once. Furthermore, feeding Yoshi 50 cookies will earn Mario a Frog Coin.





 4  Belome Temple’s Treasure Room 
A Cache Of Valuable Items
        

There is a hidden treasure room in Belome Temple, which requires people to first obtain a key in Monstro Town by shaking it free from a ledge above a door. This requires repeatedly talking to the house’s Thwomp inhabitant. Then, in Belome Temple, if Mario asks for fortunes until he receives one saying that the Belome Statue is not receiving visitors, he can travel down the elevator to a Golden Belome statue, which will accept the Monstro Town key, granting access to the treasure room. This room is full of useful items, including several Flowers and Frog Coins.





 3  The Sheep Attack 
Requires A Mystery Egg
        

Obtaining the Sheep Attack requires first buying the Mystery Egg in Moleville, which itself requires the Lucky Jewel. The egg can then be hatched by Peach wearing the Nurture Ring and using the Mystery Egg 10 times in battle. This will reward players with the Lamb’s Lure, which can turn an enemy into a sheep that flees battle. Turning 48 enemies into sheep will prompt a message saying that “the flock is full.” The Lamb Lure will then turn into the Sheep Attack, which can turn all enemies into sheep at once, a funny end to any battle.





 2  Lazy Shell 
A Perfect Combination Of Offense And Defense


 







The Lazy Shells are interesting items, being both Mario’s best weapon and an impressive piece of armor that any character can wear. Accordingly, obtaining them requires taking a few steps. Mario must collect a Seed from Bean Valley by talking to a Beezo after defeating Megasmilax. The same Beezo can also be found on an invisible path on the east side of Nimbus Land after beating Valentina, and will give Mario Fertilizer there. Bringing both items to the Gardener Toad in Rose Town will allow an enormous beanstalk to grow, with the Lazy Shells found in chests at the top.





 1  Super Suit 
Awesome End-Game Armor
        

Obtaining the Super Suit is one of the most difficult feats in Super Mario RPG, requiring an excellent sense of timing. To earn what is perhaps the best armor in the game, Mario must perform 100 consecutive Super Jump attacks by making the increasingly difficult timed button presses to add extra jumps. This is best done by battling a Spikey, which is immune to jump attacks and cannot be accidentally defeated with them. After managing the feat, a Chow in Monstro Town will reward the plumber with the Super Suit, which is armor perfect for facing the game’s secret hidden boss.
Successfully chaining 30 Super Jump attacks will earn the powerful Attack Scarf weapon from the same Chow, which blocks instant death attacks when equipped. 

The range of secrets to be found in Super Mario RPG cannot be underestimated and adds many extra hours of fun to the game’s playtime. Moreover, it seems that the harder they are to find, the cooler the prize will be, with the most well-hidden secrets, including some of the best battle items and equipment in the game. With that in mind, those seeking out every hidden detail of Super Mario RPG are sure to be well-prepared for even the toughest opponents.
