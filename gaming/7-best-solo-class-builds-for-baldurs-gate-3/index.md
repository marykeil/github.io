## Literature Review

Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 provides a team of companions, some prefer to take on the game solo. These builds will help with that massive task.





A good solo build for BG3 needs to be able to not only survive the trials thrown at the character but remain fun all the way to the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Versatility is key and makes the difference between surviving a fight or wiping completely. These builds all have different play styles, with some focusing more on damage while others on tanking, but each will give a solo player the best chance when playing without companions.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 7  Bearbarian 
Druid (6) Barbarian (6)


The Druid Barbarian multiclass build is one that is well known, and for good reason. Start with Druid for two levels to gain a subclass and choose Circle of the Moon before switching to Barbarian for three levels to pick up that subclass. Wildheart is a great choice for a more tank-based run, with Bear Heart being great for resistance to more damage. However, for a more damage-based build, Berserker is a fantastic specialty for the level six ability Mindless Rage which prevents being charmed for frightened.
After choosing a Barbarian subclass switch back to Druid for another four levels to gain higher level spells, primal strike, and better wild shape forms mainly owlbear. Good Druid spells to keep in mind are enhanced leap, goodberry, longstrider, and of course speak with animals. Finally, switch back to Barbarian for the rest of the game to gain extra attacks and increased movement.





 6  Dual Crossbow 
Ranger (5) Fighter (4) Rogue (3)
        

This build is based on the sharpshooter feat, which is a must in order to get extra damage as well as counteract BG3&#39;s high-ground rules. Start out by creating a Ranger and at second level choose the Archery Fighting Style to gain plus two to ranged weapon attacks. Then at third level choose Gloomstalker to get Dread Ambusher to gain plus three to initiative and Superior Darkvision to make sure ranged attacks are rarely at disadvantage. Take Ranger for five levels to get the Sharpshooter feat before switching to fighter.
Here, Two-Weapon Fighting can be chosen to add ability modifiers to off-hand attacks, which is crucial for this build. Continue with Fighter to gain Action Surge, then choose Battle Master for the Precision Attack manoeuvre. Continue with Fighter for another level to gain a second feat, then switch to rogue for the remaining three levels to gain a second bonus attack and sneak attacks for extra damage later in the game.





 5  Gloomstalker Assassin 
Ranger (9) Rogue (3)
        

For a more stealth-based build that aims to destroy enemies from ranged and disappear when needed, then the Gloomstalker Assassin is perfect. This is a wonderfully simple build that starts out in Ranger for three levels with the Gloomstalker subclass before dipping into Rogue for a further three levels. After choosing the Assassin subclass, switch back to Ranger for the remaining levels.
The Gloomstalker’s Dread Ambusher which gives plus three to initiative works really well with the Assassin&#39;s Assassinate: Initiative feature to gain advantage on enemies who haven&#39;t taken a turn yet. Adding in the Alert feat can also boost this, meaning that the character will always be top of the initiative. An alternative early game was to create this build is to level Ranger to level six before speaking with Withers who can help respec in BG3and splitting three levels each in ranger and Rogue.

The Dark Urge Origin in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has an intriguing but bloody backstory. Here are some fun builds to help roleplay such an odd character.








 4  Ninja 
Monk (7) Rogue (5)
        

Another fun and durable stealth build is the Ninja Monk, using a mixture of the Way of Shadow Monk with Thief Rogue. This ranged build makes use of having two bonus actions each round to use the Monk&#39;s ability Shadow Step and the Rogue&#39;s Hide action. Start with creating a Monk and continue to level three to choose Way of Shadow before switching to Rogue.
Level Rogue for five levels to gain the Thief&#39;s Fast Hands, Uncanny Dodge, and the extra sneak attack damage. Then switch back to continue leveling Monk. For feats, focus on improving Dexterity first, but Sharpshooter is also an excellent choice.





 3  Classic Palalock 
Paladin (7) Warlock (5)


A Paladin and Warlock multiclass build is another DnD classic as both use Charisma as their main spellcasting ability, and Warlocks regain their spell slots back on a short rest to help maintain damage output. To start, create a Paladin, Oath of the Ancients is a good choice for the Paladin subclass for the Aura of Warding at level seven to take half damage from spells. Continue to level up the Paladin to level seven before switching to Warlock.
Here, choose The Great Old One as a patron for Mortal Reminder to make enemies frightened when a critical hit is landed. When choosing Eldritch Invocations, pick Repelling Blast and Beguiling Influence and Pact of the Blade for the Pact Boon. A great feat to choose for this build is Savage Attacker as it rolls damage twice and takes the higher number, but Charisma should be prioritized for Ability Improvements.





 2  Tavern Brawler Monk 
Monk (8) Rogue (4)
        

The Tavern Brawler Monk is a fantastic and fun-to-play BG3 build that makes use of the Tavern Brawler feat. To create this build start out with a Rogue to gain sneak attack then switch to Monk and level this through to level six. This will give a good solid foundation with Unarmoured Defence, Unarmoured Movement, and Stunning Strike, as well as picking up Tavern Brawler.
The Way of the Open Hand works well with this build as it gives more options when using Flurry of Blows. Then switch over to Rogue for three levels, choosing the subclass Thief. Pairing Thief with Monk gives an extra bonus action which should be used for Flurry of Blow to attack a whopping four times a turn. After this, return to Monk to gain Evasion and Stillness of Mind to help with end-game bosses.





 1  Ice Assassin 
Wizard (9) Warlock (2) Cleric (1)


Finally, a powerful Wizard build that makes use of ice spells and abjuration to not only deal out massive amounts of damage but also become almost untouchable. Start out by creating a Warlock, choosing Great Old One, and picking up armour of agathys which will become increasing important as the character levels up. At second level, choose Repelling Blast and Armour of Shadows. This again is important as it allows mage armour to be cast without a spell slot, and as mage armour is an abjuration spell this will also become increasingly important.
After that switch to Cleric for one level choosing the Tempest Domain for its ability Wrath of the Storm, this will work very well as this build makes heavy use of water to deal extra damage with cold spells and Wrath of the Storm will allow lightning damage to be added to that mix. Then it is time to switch to Wizard and choose the subclass abjuration to gain Arcane Ward to protect the character from harm. This shield is fuelled by abjuration spells such as mage armour, armour of agathys, sanctuary and glyph of warding.
Another focus for this build is cold damage spells, as combining this with create water to deal extra damage. There are a couple of items to keep an eye out for that really boost this build even more, and both can be found early in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The Morning Frost staff can be reforged by finding the pieces in the Underdark and the Coldbrim Hat, which can be found in a chest in Balthazar&#39;s chambers in Moonrise Towers.
