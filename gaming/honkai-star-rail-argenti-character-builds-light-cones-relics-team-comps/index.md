## Literature Review

Unlock Argenti’s potential as a main Physical DPS in Honkai: Star Rail. Here are his best Light Cones, Relics, Ornaments, stats, team comps, and more.





Argenti is different from several other Erudition characters, many of which rely on follow-up attacks to deal damage. Jing Yuan in Honkai: Star Rail is one such example. Argenti does not actually have a mechanic that allows him to strike with secondary attacks. Instead, Argenti has an interesting kit that plays around with Energy Regeneration Rate and increases to CRIT Rate. Due to his Talent, the more enemies hit by Argenti, the more Energy he regenerates and the higher the boost to his CRIT Rate. Of course, you will need to optimize this with the best Light Cones, Relics, stats, and a proper team comp to support him.

 Best Light Cones For Argenti 
          

The best Light Cone for Argenti in Honkai: Star Rail is his signature 5-star weapon, An Instant Before A Gaze. This premium item can only be obtained from the limited-time Light Cone banner whenever Argenti is featured in the gacha system. An Instant Before A Gaze grants a 36% boost to CRIT DMG. When the user activates their Ultimate, their Ultimate DMG is increased based on their Max Energy – each point of Energy increases the Ultimate DMG by 0.36%, up to 180 points. This means that, with Argenti’s 180 Max Energy points, he can effectively get a 64.8% boost to Ultimate DMG.



This goes along well with Argenti’s kit. Although he has a high Max Energy cap, this full amount can be used to deal extra damage to opponents via the second form of his Ultimate. With An Instant Before A Gaze, Argenti can further boost his damage output when consuming all Energy.







If you do not have access to Argenti’s signature Light Cone, a 5-star substitute you can employ with him is Jing Yuan’s signature weapon, called Before Dawn. Equipping it will grant the user a 36% increase to CRIT DMG and an 18% boost to their Skill and Ultimate DMG. These buffs alone are enough to justify its usage. Unfortunately, the second portion of the Light Cone’s skill goes to waste on Argenti since he does not have follow-up attacks in Honkai: Star Rail, which are empowered by the piece of gear.

Himeko’s Night on the Milky Way is also a viable alternative to Argenti’s signature Light Cone. The 5-star item grants a 9.0% ATK boost for every enemy on the field, up to 5 stacks and, when an opponent is inflicted with Weakness Break, the DMG dealt by the user increases by 30% for 1 turn. Although fairly generic, it does fit Argenti’s kit and allows him to have his offensive powers boosted.

The table below lists the best builds for Argenti in Honkai: Star Rail, including his recommended Light Cones, Relics, stats, and more:




 Best Build For Argenti In Honkai: Star Rail   Light Cone    An Instant Before A Gaze (Best 5-star)   Before Dawn (Substitute 5-star)   Night On The Milky Way (Substitute 5-star)   Today Is Another Peaceful Day (4-star option)   Make The World Clamor (4-star option)      Relic &amp; Ornament Set  Relics:  Champion of Streetwise Boxing (4 pieces)    Ornaments:  Inert Salsotto (2 pieces)   Space Sealing Station (2 pieces - temporary)      Stat Priority    ATK   CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate   Energy Recharge Rate   Physical DMG   SPD (optional)      Skill Priority    Ultimate   Talent   Skill   Basic Attack      



5-star Light Cones can be difficult to obtain, however. Luckily, there are 4-star options for Argenti to use in Honkai: Star Rail, some of which are actually very good. A great one is Today Is Another Peaceful Day. Upon entering battle, it boosts the user’s DMG by 0.20% per Energy point, up to 160 points. Even with the Light Cone disregarding 20 points of Argenti’s Max Energy, it can still grant him a 32% boost to all of his DMG. An equally strong option is Make The World Clamor, which immediately regenerates 20 Energy upon entering battle and increases Ultimate DMG by 32%.



Use a Light Cone that increases Argenti’s offensive powers or helps with his Energy Regeneration Rate. You can disregard most of the Light Cones that increase the power of follow-up attacks.









 Best Relics, Ornaments, &amp; Stats For Argenti 
          

Aside from giving Argenti a Light Cone to wield, you will also need to find Relics in Honkai: Star Rail to improve his stats. So far, there is only one decent option to choose from. The Relics you will need to farm are those from the Champion of Streetwise Boxing set. Having two pieces equipped grants a 10% bonus to Physical DMG. With four pieces, after the user attacks or is hit, their ATK is boosted by 5% for the rest of the battle, an effect that can stack up to 5x times. This effectively allows Argenti to get a 25% ATK bonus during longer battles.

You will have a bit more leeway when choosing the Ornament set for Argenti. Inert Salsotto can be one of the best ones in Honkai: Star Rail – its two-piece bonus grants an 8% increase to CRIT Rate and, when the user’s CRIT Rate reaches 50% or higher, their Ultimate and follow-up attack DMG increases by 15%. If Argenti’s main body Relic has CRIT Rate as the main stat, reaching the 50% should not be too much trouble.






The effort in farming CRIT Rate will pay off with a great load of bonus DMG to Argenti’s main source of DMG, his Ultimate.




As a temporary alternative for Argenti, you can use Space Sealing Station. The two-piece bonus granted by this Ornament in Honkai: Star Rail increases the user’s ATK by 12% and, when their SPD reaches 120 or higher, their ATK gets an extra 12% boost. This is recommended as a temporary solution, as its generic buffs do not play around Argenti’s specific gameplay kit as much as Inert Salsotto does.

The stats you want to look out for when farming Relics and Ornaments for Argenti in Honkai: Star Rail are ATK, CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG, Physical DMG, and Energy Regeneration Rate. These stats are very important for his gameplay loop. SPD can also be a helpful stat, especially if you are using the Space Sealing Station Ornament set. Nevertheless, he should be quickened by his team comp, so your focus should be on the previously mentioned offensive stats and Energy Regen Rate to keep his Ultimate available whenever possible.






 Best Team Comps For Argenti 
         

The ideal team comps for Argenti are those that acknowledge him as the main DPS. Although you can always follow a basic team structure with him as your main DPS, a sub-DPS, a support, and a healer or shielder, the best team comp for him is a hypercarry team. Having Tingyun on the team can help with damage output in addition to a precious boost to Energy Regeneration Rate. The second support character can either be Hanya or Bronya, as they will boost Argenti’s SPD and ATK. If you use Huohuo in Honkai: Star Rail as your healer, she can provide extra Energy Regen and ATK bonuses.



Hanya can also help with Skill Point regeneration, which can prove to be very useful to keep Argenti dealing as much damage as he possibly can, even when his Ultimate is not charged.







The table below lists a few team comp suggestions for Argenti:

 Best Team Comps For Argenti In Honkai: Star Rail   Hypercarry Team    Argenti (Physical - Erudition)   Tingyun (Lightning - Harmony)   Hanya (Physical - Harmony) or Bronya (Wind - Harmony)   Huohuo (Wind - Abundance) or Luocha (Imaginary - Abundance)      Mono Physical Team    Argenti (Physical - Erudition)   Luka (Physical - Nihility) or Silver Wolf (Quantum - Nihility)   Hanya (Physical - Harmony)   Natasha (Physical - Abundance)      



Another option is to make a mono Physical team in Honkai: Star Rail. Having Argenti as the DPS, Hanya as the support, Natasha as the healer, and either Luka or Silver Wolf as the sub-DPS, you can pummel through opponents&#39; teams. Granted, Silver Wolf is a Quantum hero, but having her inflict new weaknesses on enemies and lowering their DEF can help sustain the rest of the Physical-based team. The rule of thumb for using Argenti is having a team that can provide him with offensive buffs and, preferably a lot of Energy Regeneration.



There will be more options for a mono Physical team as the game progresses and new Physical characters are added over time.









 Skill Priority For Argenti 
          

When leveling up Argenti’s abilities in Honkai: Star Rail, also known as Traces, you should prioritize his Ultimate. That is his main source of damage and the most precious skill he can use against opponents. The next Trace to level up is his Talent, which regenerates his Energy and boosts his CRIT Rate for every enemy he strikes. Following that, you will want to increase his Skill, which is his secondary source of damage and the one to be spanned during his Ultimate’s downtime. The last Trace to be leveled is his Basic Attack. Although it can deal a lot of damage, it is the weakest link in his kit.

Building Argenti is not especially hard and though there is some complexity to his kit, it is not difficult to understand or master. He is powerful on his own, but smoothing out the rough edges and giving him the best gear and team members to work with can significantly improve his presence on the field when facing multiple enemies in Honkai: Star Rail.
