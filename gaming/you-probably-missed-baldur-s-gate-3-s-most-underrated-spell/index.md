# You Probably Missed Baldur s Gate 3 s Most Underrated Spell


## SUMMARY 



  Animating spores is one of the most powerful spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.   The spell can be cast at any time, in and out of battle, without using a spell slot, but it only works on certain targets accessible during a specific quest in Act Two.   While there are alternative spells with similar effects, neither are as effective as Animating Spores, so it&#39;s best to make the most of it while the opportunity arises.

## Literature Review

One of the most powerful spells in Baldur’s Gate 3 is easily missed depending on the player’s early-game choices. Here’s how to get it (and keep it).




One of the best spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is also one of the most easily missed. There are a lot of overpowered spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, from those that characters unlock naturally as they level up to those they have to go out of their way to find. Some of them are simple, sixth-level, high-damage AoE barrages, while others are clever little buffs that take advantage of game-breaking exploits in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.




However, some of the best spells aren&#39;t cast by warlocks, wizards, or even clerics. One of the most powerful spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 first comes from an unexpected ally, and similar tactics can later be incorporated into the party&#39;s permanent arsenal to allow them to take control of the battlefield. However, most players pass these right by, constrained by that little vexation known as moral obligation.

                  One Easily Missed Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Mechanic Will Have Companions Camping In Style   There are many mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are not evidently explained. Here is one that may make your camping sessions more pleasant.   


 Animating Spores Can Be The Best Spell In BG3 
          

Animating spores might just be the most powerful spell in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, if the party knows how to use it. It can resurrect a dead body with full HP and all its capacities, completely under the player&#39;s control. The effect lasts until the reanimated corpse dies or the party takes a long rest. And the best part: animating spores can be cast at any time, in and out of battle, once per turn without using a spell slot.




There are a few limitations. Animating spores only works on humanoids and monstrosities, and it&#39;s only usable during a certain, very much missable quest in Act Two. Thankfully, there are plenty of monstrosities around in the Underdark, and if harnessed correctly, these can carry the party all the way through.



 How To Get Animating Spores In BG3 
And Similar, Permanent Spells To Replace It
         

In order to gain access to the truest version of animating spores, the party will have to side with Glut over Spaw in BG3. Players first meet Glut as they explore the Myconid Colony in the Underdark during Act Two. He&#39;ll start a chat with them, explaining that he originally comes from a different fungal circle from the rest of the local mushrooms, one that was almost completely wiped out by the duergar with whom they share the Underdark. Spaw wants the party to kill the duergar, then help him overthrow Spaw as leader of the Myconid Colony.




This is a decidedly violent choice, and best suits the needs of an evil playthrough of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. However, as evil-aligned choices go, the party could do a lot worse. Killing Spaw doesn&#39;t result in any major story consequences, and as long as he&#39;s taken out before he can rouse the rest of the colony to his aid, can be done quickly and cleanly.

Glut is a good ally to have, in no small part because of animating spores. However, he only sticks around for the battle against the duergar, then disappears until the rest of the party is ready to take down Sovereign Spaw. He won&#39;t be able to take the boat that ferries everyone else across the Underdark, so players are on their own from the Grymforge on. However, Glut can be used to clear out half the Underdark, effectively carrying the party through half of Act Two. And there are two features that permanent player characters can take later that are almost equivalent to animating spores.

Circle of Spores druids gain the class feature Fungal Infestation at level six. This allows them to raise a zombie as a reaction, which is useful in that it works more quickly than Glut&#39;s animating spores. However, Fungal Infestation can only be used four times per day, and only then on humanoid and beast characters. And regardless of the target&#39;s stats and abilities before death, they&#39;ll always come back as a level three zombie, which may make them weaker.




Wizards have the slightly better spell animate dead, which they can also begin taking at level six. This allows them to create several different types of undead out of any small or medium corpse, with different types specializing in different attacks. Zombies and ghouls focus on melee, while skeletons have ranged attacks with bows. Wizards of the Necromancy School have two added benefits: they can raise two undead at a time, with each one receiving additional HP based on the caster&#39;s wizard level, as well as a damage bonus equal to the wizard&#39;s proficiency.



 Best Uses Of Animating Spores In BG3 
          

However, neither alternative is quite as good as animating spores, so it&#39;s best to make the most of it while Glut is in the party. Remember, animating spores only works on humanoids and beasts, so it&#39;s important to choose targets wisely and keep them alive as long as possible. Humanoids are all well and good: there are plenty of powerful duergar hanging around the Underdark who can be great assets to the party. However, monstrosities are stronger and more powerful all around, and there are plenty of them scattered throughout the Underdark.




Minotaurs have 84 HP, and a wide variety of moves that can push enemies back or knock them prone. They&#39;re best for battles against single targets or smaller groups, especially when they take place in cramped arenas. There are also plenty of ledges that enemy NPCs can be flung off of for one-hit kills. For larger groups, however, there&#39;s no better animating spores target than a Bulette. These creatures are heavily armored, with 125 HP. Like Minotaurs, they can push enemies off cliffs or knock them prone. They also have access to several AOE attacks, and can burrow underground or jump on top of enemies for massive damage.

Unfortunately, Bulettes are bulky and hard to maneuver. As a result, they&#39;re best suited to larger battle arenas, especially multi-leveled ones where they can put the full brunt of their ground-pounding abilities on display. Just be careful when maneuvering them around the party and friendly NPCs like Glut, as they definitely don&#39;t want to get caught in the Bulette&#39;s line of fire.




Thankfully, if one of these animating spores targets doesn&#39;t work out, the spell can be recast on each of Glut&#39;s turns. It&#39;s worth experimenting with as many reanimation targets as possible, testing out each of their abilities and determining which ones work best. Since there are no limitations on how many times it can be cast, there&#39;s no risk in using it and reusing it to Glut&#39;s delight. It might be too overpowered to bring along for the entire game, but it can certainly make Act Two of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 a breeze.
