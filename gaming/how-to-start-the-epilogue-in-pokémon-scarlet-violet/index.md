## Literature Review

There is a special procedure to unlock the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but the game does not tell you that, which can be confusing.





While wrapping up the whole story, the Epilogue also allows players to encounter the long-rumored Peach Mythical from Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. It was previously known as Dokutaro in the many leaks that led up to the second expansion’s release but has since been confirmed to be called Pecharunt. You can get This dual Poison- and Ghost-type Mythical Pokémon in the extra content. However, before putting it inside a Poké Ball, you first need to unlock the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.

 How To Unlock The Mochi Mayhem Epilogue In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
          

To unlock the Epilogue and start Mochi Mayhem in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you first need to connect the game to the internet and access the Mystery Gift feature in the Poké Portal. There, you will choose the option “Receive Via Internet” and select the Mythical Pecha Berry Gift. This will grant you a special Key Item. The next step is concluding the story of the main game and the two DLCs, The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk.



You can get the special Mythical Pecha Berry Key Item regardless of having finished the DLC or not. Starting the Epilogue, however, requires completion of the Indigo Disk DLC.







After these two steps have been done, you will need to travel to Kitakami’s Mossui Town. You should head to the small store west of the Community Center upon arrival. However, instead of talking to the vendor inside the booth, you will need to interact with the small pink plush doll slightly to the left. This will initiate a special cutscene in which your Trainer notices the item and then gets a phone call from Arven in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

After the cutscene finishes and the mysterious pink plush doll vanishes from sight, the special card for the Epilogue will appear, revealing its official title: Mochi Mayhem. As such, you will have successfully unlocked and started the Epilogue. You can return to your home in Paldea to continue the journey through this extra content in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
