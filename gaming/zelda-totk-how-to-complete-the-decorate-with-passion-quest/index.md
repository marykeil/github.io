## Literature Review

The Decorate with Passion quest in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has you find different parts to fuse together an unexpected and unique weapon.





The character Boraa of the Kara Kara Bazaar gives you the &#34;Decorate with Passion&#34; quest, specifically at coordinates (-3227, -2520, 0023) on your map. The Bazaar is a shop where you can buy tons of useful items with every earned Rupee in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that Link has. You are asked to craft a weapon for Boraa&#39;s mentor, and to &#34;make it sparkle and radiate burning passion.&#34;




                  How To Get Unlimited Rupees In Zelda: TOTK Using The Frozen Meat Glitch   There are several ways to make Rupees in Zelda: TOTK, but they&#39;re tedious. With the Icy Meat Glitch, Link can make 40,000 Rupees in less than 10 mins.

You have to show Boraa a certain weapon as a reference first, by fusing a Ruby onto any weapon in Link&#39;s inventory. You can talk to Boraa to learn that her mentor is allergic to Monster Parts, which tells you what Link should avoid fusing onto the example. Once you have a Ruby and a weapon, activate your Fuse ability in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to create a new tool that Boraa can admire.



A Ruby material can be found in many caves and ore deposits around Hyrule. Normally, creating a weapon with a Ruby attached to it causes the tool to deal fire damage to enemies when you hit them with one of Link&#39;s melee attacks.







Talk to Boraa again when you have a Ruby-infused weapon, then pick the dialogue option &#34;What about this?&#34; Boraa will be very happy to take the weapon back to her mentor, mentioning that he will greatly appreciate the passion in its design. This will complete the &#34;Decorate with Passion&#34; quest, letting Link earn a rare item in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as a reward.



 Rewards from the Decorate with Passion Quest 
          

Boraa gives you an Electric Keese Wing as a reward for your efforts, a Monster Part used to create weapons with electric damage from fusion. Take a strong weapon and Fuse this Material on it to give Link a new source of elemental damage in their arsenal. You may also combine the Electric Keese Wing with Critters in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to make Elixirs that could give you different positive buffs.




Another use for the Keese Wing is to make yellow dye for clothing that you collect throughout your adventures in Hyrule. The many applications of this item makes completing the &#34;Decorate with Passion&#34; quest a worthwhile goal in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017.

Additionally, he will discover the secrets of the dark ones that dwell below and above the earth.
