## Literature Review

With the release of the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you can now fly freely with Koraidon or Miraidon. Here’s how to unlock it.





There are also plenty of new and returning creatures to catch, evolve, and trade. Most of them are part of the Blueberry Pokédex in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. While new Pokémon and a shocking campaign are at the forefront, other features arrived with the expansion. You can now sync up with your Pokémon and control them inside Blueberry Academy’s Terarium, for instance. Another new playable feature is the ability to fly with Koraidon and Miraidon in Scarlet and Violet. You could previously mount them and glide the Legendary mascots, but now you can control them fully while in the air.




                  One New Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk DLC Was Hiding All Along   It seems like one of the new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk has been hiding in the base games, Scarlet and Violet, for over a year.

To unlock the flying feature for your mount in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you will first need to start the expansion and head over to Blueberry Academy. You will then need to make your way through the campaign, where you will meet BB League Elite Four member Amarys, and she will challenge you to take on her time trial, which allows Koraidon or Miraidon, depending on your version, to fly throughout the activity. Amarys does this by providing the Legendary mascot with a special supplement, which enables flight in the Indigo Disk DLC.




After that, you will need to continue the story and reach the end of the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. After you have concluded the campaign, which will not be discussed to avoid potential spoilers, you will need to return to Blueberry Academy and move to Classroom 3-2. At the far end of the room, you will find the Amarys.

Talk to her and she will thank you for your efforts in helping Blueberry Academy and reveal she prepared some of the supplements she had been using in the trials. Koraidon or Miraidon will then consume this supplement abundantly, which permanently unlocks flying in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.



Unlocking this feature allows you to fly with Koraidon and Miraidon anywhere you can summon them. This includes the Terarium itself, as well as Paldea and the land of Kitakami.




Amarys also mentions a harder version of her time trial, but you are not required to tackle the challenge. At this point, you have unlocked the flying ability for your Legendary mount. To activate it, you must start gliding and then press the Left Stick. This will enable your ride to fly up and down freely, without restrictions.




Flying can be a handy tool to navigate hard-to-reach areas and can even facilitate getting access to the Legendaries in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
