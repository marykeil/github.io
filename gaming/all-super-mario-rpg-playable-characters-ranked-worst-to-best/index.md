# All Super Mario RPG Playable Characters, Ranked Worst To Best


## SUMMARY 


 Party composition is important in Super Mario RPG, with up to three customizable characters. Differences in stats, skills, gear, and recruitability affect their usefulness in battles. 
 Bowser is the worst playable character due to his stats decline at higher levels and lack of strong special attacks and gear. However, he has high max HP and can serve as a tank. 
 Geno is the best character in Super Mario RPG, with the highest starting attack stat, powerful specials, and access to Geno Boost. This skill scales and provides the most bang for the player&#39;s buck.

## Literature Review

There are five playable characters in Super Mario RPG. They all have their strengths, but some are just better overall. Here are the rankings.




Party composition is the key to success in Super Mario RPG. It&#39;s not as big of a deal as some other Square Enix-originated RPGs, like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy series, but since the party is more customizable than certain other Mario RPGs, say, the Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series, it does make a difference. Players can have up to three characters in their parties at a time, and, unique to the Super Mario RPG remake, can swap characters at any time during a battle for greater flexibility.
There are five playable characters in Super Mario RPG: Mario himself, Princess Peach, new characters Geno and Mallow, and, in somewhat of a departure from his typical role, Bowser. Some of them are accessible from the beginning, while others are unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Their usefulness in a fight is determined not only by their inherent stats and skills, but also by when they become recruitable, and the selection of gear they can equip. Taking all of that into account, here are all five playable characters in Super Mario RPG, ranked worst to best.
            
 
 &#34;A Delightful Rendition of a Historic Treasure&#34;: Super Mario RPG Review 
Super Mario RPG brings the fan-favorite classic back with welcome bells and whistles, inspiring players young and old to rediscover this Mario curio.












 








 5  Bowser 
The Perennial Villain At His Worst
        

Mario&#39;s most formidable foe is a lot less scary in Super Mario RPG. When first recruited, Bowser is actually pretty decent. His strength, defense, and max HP are some of the highest in the game. The problem is that, at later levels, Bowser&#39;s stats simply don&#39;t compare to the other playable party members. All characters&#39; stat gains taper off as they level up, but Bowser&#39;s take one of the most noticeable dives. His special attacks are some of the least effective moves available, especially when compared to the more powerful offensive characters.
Couple that with the lack of decent, high-level gear available for Bowser, and he&#39;s unfortunately the worst playable character in Mario RPG. However, he maintains a pretty high max HP throughout, with the highest potential HP by the time he reaches his level cap. That does make him pretty useful as a tank, but his poor equipment means he&#39;ll take more damage from each attack.





 4  Mallow 
A Bit Of A Softie


 







Mallow is Super Mario RPG&#39;s resident spellcaster, and as a result, he&#39;s a great offensive option. Mallow has some of the best special attacks in the game, especially his level 18 special Star Rain. Star Rain can damage all enemies at once, making it easy to wipe out entire groups in a single hit. Mallow&#39;s special attacks also have relatively low FP costs, too, so he can string together powerful attacks without worrying about depleting all his resources.
The trouble with Mallow is that his relatively low defensive stats and max HP make him an easy target for enemies. Mallow needs careful defending, or he&#39;ll constantly get knocked out, leaving the rest of the party at an offensive disadvantage. The gear available to him marks a relative improvement over Bowser&#39;s, so he can defend himself slightly better at higher levels. And since he&#39;s recruited pretty early on, he can come in pretty handy before harder-hitting enemies start to show up.





 3  Princess Peach 
The Invaluable Healer
        

Although she&#39;s kidnapped near the beginning of Super Mario RPG, Peach eventually escapes, and is able to join the playable party. Her role is that of the archetypal healer, which makes her indispensable in certain encounters - especially boss fights. Her specials are mostly used to restore the party&#39;s HP and revive them when they&#39;re knocked out, but at higher levels, she can learn moves that inflict status effects on enemies.
            
 
 Super Mario RPG Remake Is More Exciting Than A New Paper Mario 
Although Paper Mario has taken more of the spotlight over the years, a reappearance of Super Mario RPG is likely to bring more to the table.



At level 18, Peach can also learn the offensive special Psych Bomb, which is especially useful since it inflicts non-elemental damage, meaning enemies with elemental resistance are affected the same as everybody else. She also has pretty good defensive stats, and a max HP to rival Bowser&#39;s. Her only weakness is that she can&#39;t do very much damage; Peach is strictly a defensive team member.





 2  Mario 
The High-Damage Hero


 







Of course, as the protagonist and only permanent party member of Super Mario RPG, Mario himself is one of the best playable characters. Like most RPG protagonists, he starts out with pretty decent stats across the board, and can be somewhat customized to the player&#39;s preference as he levels up. Mario specializes in physical attacks, especially jumps, and learns several handy specials as he levels up. At level 14, he gains the multi-target Ultra Jump, which can deal more than 10,000 damage across multiple enemies with the right levels, equipment, and timing.
Mario can also learn a few fire magic spells, and his level 18 special, Ultra Flame, is his most powerful ability. But even his base attacks are pretty reliable, and with the wide variety of gear available to him, Mario can be kitted out to resist almost any attack. However, he pales in comparison to the final playable character in Super Mario RPG.





 1  Geno 
A Fan Favorite, And For Good Reason


 







Geno is the best character in Super Mario RPG for a wide variety of reasons. First, he has the best starting attack stat in the game. His natural attack and defense are higher than Mario&#39;s, and his specials, although difficult to time, can be incredibly powerful. In particular, the level 11 attack Geno Whirl can do up to 9,999 damage if timed correctly.
More importantly, though, Geno has access to the move Geno Boost beginning at level eight. This increases his attack power by 50%, and, if timed right, has the same effect on his defense. As a result, this skill scales with Geno, and is just as powerful at level 30 as it was at level one. However, it only costs four FP each time it&#39;s used, giving the most bang for the player&#39;s buck of any skill in Super Mario RPG.
Thankfully, Super Mario RPG isn&#39;t too hard overall. While party composition makes a difference, most playable character arrangements will be able to defeat most enemies one way or another. Certain characters do work better with one another: Peach can be a big help in keeping Mallow alive, or Bowser can focus on defense while Mario and Geno take the offense. But on the whole, it doesn&#39;t really matter. Players are encouraged to experiment with unique character combinations in Super Mario RPG, and with party switching on the fly, that&#39;s easier than ever before.
