 What Characters Are Confirmed For Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2? 
         




28 characters have already been confirmed for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, including those from Nicktoons old and new. These are all the confirmed characters for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2:

 Character  Source   Aang  Avatar: The Last Airbender   Angry Beavers  The Angry Beavers   April O’Neil  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   Azula  Avatar: The Last Airbender   Danny Phantom  Danny Phantom   Donatello  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   El Tigre  El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera   Ember  Danny Phantom   Garfield  Garfield   Gerald  Hey Arnold!

All-Star Brawl 2 expands on the original game&#39;s roster of 25 characters. New additions include all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, plus April O&#39;Neil and Rocksteady. Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender also makes her debut, alongside fellow Fire Nation higher-ups Uncle Iroh and Prince Zuko. Jimmy Neutron appears for the first time - the only character from his show to appear in the original All-Star Brawl was his father, Hugh.

Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Squidward join their Bikini Bottom neighbor SpongeBob as playable characters. El Tigre and Angry Beavers are both represented by their titular characters. From Hey Arnold, Gerald and Grandma Gertie have been added to the roster, but it&#39;s not clear whether Helga Pataki will still be playable in All-Star Brawl 2.



 What Stages Are In Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2? 
          




Only five stages have been confirmed for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 ahead of its release. While other stages are visible in trailers, they haven&#39;t yet been positively identified. Players will probably have to wait for release to determine exactly what they are. But these are all the stages known to appear in the sequel:

 Stage  Source   Rooftop Rumble  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   Technodrome Takedown  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   The Flying Dutchman&#39;s Ship  SpongeBob SquarePants   Royal Woods Cemetery  The Loud House   Sewer Slam  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   




 




But trailers for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 have also showcased a variety of stages that haven&#39;t been explicitly confirmed yet. Some of these appear to be redesigned stages from the first game, while others are instantly recognizable from their source material. Stages resembling Jellyfish Fields and the Krabby Patty-shaped wrestling ring from SpongeBob, along with the Western Air Temple stage from Avatar that appeared in the original game, have already been spotted, and are likely to appear in the final product.

                  SpongeBob SquarePants: Squidward&#39;s Name Gets His Species Wrong   Squidward Tentacles from SpongeBob Squarepants may have squid in his name, but Squidward isn&#39;t a squid. Here&#39;s Squidward&#39;s species explained.     



 How Is Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 Different From The Original? 
          




As with any sequel to a fighting game, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 will feature changes to its existing characters. Every character recurring from the original game will be either tweaked or entirely rebuilt, with new moves and balance changes sweeping the game. Of course, All-Star Brawl 2 adds 11 new characters to the mix as detailed above, and will include a number of brand-new stages to go along with them. Other characters from the original game have yet to be confirmed for the sequel, so it&#39;s unclear whether they&#39;ve been completely cut or simply haven&#39;t been shown.

For the first time ever, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 will also feature a campaign mode in which Nicktoons will team up to take on the villainous Plasmius. Originating from the series Danny Phantom, Plasmius is the billionaire CEO of VladCo, but also moonlights as a human-ghost hybrid. The campaign appears to involve platforming challenges as well as fighting segments, as characters can be seen navigating mazelike stages and collecting purple pickups. A trailer calls this a &#34;roguelike&#34; campaign, which means it may feature the procedurally generated levels and permanent death that are the hallmarks of that genre.




But that&#39;s everything to know so far about the upcoming release. There&#39;ll certainly be more stages and characters revealed in time, but for the time being, there&#39;s nothing left to do but wait. Thankfully, it won&#39;t be a long one. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is out for all platforms on November 7, 2023.
