## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC introduces a way to catch every starter from past Generations, including those from Gen 7&#39;s Sun &amp; Moon.





The areas around Blueberry Academy are split into four diverse Biomes for you to explore when you start the second part of the expanded content. The map size of Indigo Disk DLC already has a variety of Pokémon to encounter, but even more can be added. The Terarium Club can fine-tune each region of the land and invite more Pokémon inside.






There are several organizations within the League Club that each have quests you can access from the main computer terminals from the Terarium&#39;s main building.




                  Every Scarlet &amp; Violet Version Exclusive In Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC doubles the number of version exclusives compared to The Teal Mask, and it&#39;s helpful to know the full list.   


 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Rowlet 
          

The Grass-type Sun &amp; Moon starter Rowlet can be found and caught when you spend 3,000 Battle Points (BP) to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Savannah Biome. This is a specific quest offered by the Terarium Club in exchange for the BP you earn by completing various requests. This process unlocks Rowlet and many other starter Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, like Charmander or Snivy.






 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Popplio 
          

Expending 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Coastal Biome will make Popplio appear for your character to find and catch. Finding Pokémon in this particular Biome can be tricky since the water could hide the creatures you want to discover. Wade into the water around here to eventually encounter a Popplio or perhaps even another Water-type starter.



 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Litten 
          

The feline Fire-type Litten becomes available for you to find and catch when you spend 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Canyon Biome. These high cliffs and dark caves can often be a pain to explore, but Litten&#39;s brightly colored whiskers should make them easy to spot. Those looking for a powerful team may want to evolve a Litten fast into the strong Fire-/Dark-type Incineroar to take down other trainers.




When you find and catch every Gen 7 starter Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, you have a chance to train each to fight against formidable rivals included in this expanded content.
