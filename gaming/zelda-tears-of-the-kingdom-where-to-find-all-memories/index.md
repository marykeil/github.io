## Literature Review

There are eighteen memories in Zelda TOTK, most of which are collected through finding Dragon Tears in Geoglyphs with a few being from quests.





The memories can be collected in chronological order, and it is recommended to follow them because some of them contain major spoilers for the main story. Many of these memories cover the main story beats, such as an incident that shows the Master Sword&#39;s fate in Zelda TOTK. 





 How To Unlock Dragon Tear Memories in Zelda: TOTK 
          

Every memory in Zelda TOTK is linked to a quest, and most of these memories will trigger a cutscene upon completion. However, Dragon Tears need to be found individually, and not all are in the most convenient locations. There are 12 Dragon Tear memories in total, and Link needs to trigger a quest in order to find all of them. To start the quest, you must speak to Cado near the New Serenne Stable in Zelda: TOTK, who will then direct him to Impa, who will introduce the concept of Geoglyphs to Link.

Impa will ask to visit the Zelda TOTK&#39;s Forgotten Temple where he will find a map that has the location of every Geoglyph across Hyrule. Since this information is only available at the Forgotten Temple, there is a way to save this information for future use. 






Use Link&#39;s camera on the Purah Pad to take a picture of the map so that you can access it in-game. You can also use the Nintendo Switch&#39;s Screenshot button to capture the photo.
