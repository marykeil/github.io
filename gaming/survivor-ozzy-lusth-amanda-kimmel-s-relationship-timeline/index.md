## Literature Review

Ozzy and Amanda met on Survivor season 16, &#34;Fans vs. Favorites,&#34; and quickly hit it off. There is a lot to know about their relationship timeline.




Ozzy Lusth and Amanda Kimmel met on Survivor season 16 and quickly started a romantic relationship during the game. As one of the best reality TV shows, Survivor has a history of what fans have dubbed &#34;jungle romances&#34; and showmances. A few of the show&#39;s relationships have made it after filming ends, with some couples still together. The show remains popular today, with Survivor season 46 coming soon.




Survivor players are placed in tribes with strangers and are forced to live off the land for 39 days. They all compete in challenges to win rewards and immunity, hoping to become the sole Survivor with a prize of $1,000,000. A big part of Survivor is playing an excellent social game and connecting with the other players. Some castaways from romantic alliances and Survivor season 16 even gave way to an all-couples partnership of Ozzy, Amanda, James Clement, and Parvati Shallow.

Ozzy is one of the best Survivor players never to win the show. He has played four seasons of Survivor and spent 128 days in the game. He is known for his ability to dominate in challenges, especially the ones in the water, while Amanda is known for her strategic blindsides. Ozzy first appeared on Survivor season 13, and Amanda appeared on Survivor season 15, with both of them making it to the final three in their respective seasons. They returned as favorites for Survivor: Micronesia, the first ever Fans vs. Favorites season in the show&#39;s history. Amanda and Ozzy formed an immediate connection on the show, which lasted until Ozzy&#39;s blindside on day 27 with an idol in his pocket.



 Ozzy &amp; Amanda Have Taken Different Paths 
          

Ozzy and Amanda dated throughout the filming of Survivor and later after the season wrapped, from June to August 2006. At the final tribal council, Ozzy was on the jury, and Amanda had made it to the final three again. He confessed that his feelings for her were real and that he was falling in love with her. Months later, the pair was still trying to make their relationship work in the real world.




At the Survivor season 16 reunion, Amanda announced that she and Ozzy were still dating. Shortly after the reunion, the pair broke up, having dated for around six months. Years later, Amanda is now happily married to her husband Matt Cooper and has two kids, and Ozzy is enjoying a single life traveling the world. Unlike other Survivor couples with lasting relationships, Ozzy and Amanda&#39;s fling was entertaining for viewers but short-lived.



Survivor season 16 is available for streaming on Netflix.
