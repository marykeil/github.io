## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé star Michael Ilesanmi is indeed in America in 2024 according to his latest photos. Michael and Angela have been spotted together.




90 Day Fiancé star Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi have been spotted together in the U.S. Angela and Michael have been a controversial franchise couple since their 2018 debut in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 2. Angela and Michael met when he DMed her on Facebook and the grandmother of six from Hazlehurst, Georgia found herself on a flight to Nigeria despite suspecting Michael was a scammer. Angela and Michael had differences in age, culture, and language that they tried to overcome by getting married. Angela, however, could never do away with her trust issues, and she was right about Michael cheating on her.




Still, Angela decided to give Michael one more chance because they are still together in 2024 and Michael is even in America. Reddit user u/JuggleMeThis saw “Angela and Michael IRL” on January 12, 2024.


 

Angela, wearing a long pink cardigan with loose trousers and Michael, dressed in a blue sweater with jeans, could be seen trying to enter an airport. The OP explained, “Got picked up at LAX round noon on 1/12 and Angel and Michel and some entourage cross the street right in front of us.” They revealed that their friend spotted the couple and yelled “We love you Angela” while driving past them.

As per the 90 Day Fiancé fan, Angela waved enthusiastically at them and shouted that she loves them too. “Couldn&#39;t have been a better welcome to LA. Lol,” the fan added. When a different fan said that Angela looked “Really good” in the photos, the OP replied, “She looked really good.” They admitted that they wouldn’t have recognized Angela without Michael being there. However, they noted Michael looked exactly like he did on TV. More photos of Angela and Michael together were shared by IG fan page @90dayfianceupdate. In one photo, Michael and Angela were sitting next to each other while she showed him something on her phone.

“Michael is in the US! Looks like they will be on &#39;Happily Ever After&#39;” the page wrote in their caption. Michael and Angela were last seen in 90 Day: The Last Resort. Angela had her divorce papers ready to split with Michael at the end of the season. However, couple’s therapy worked out for the couple. Michael was apologetic for having cheated on Angela. He also realized how much Angela cared for him when she rushed to Nigeria in 2022 when she heard about Michael’s mother passing away. The heartbreaking incident brought Angela and Michael closer.




Michael and Angela got married in January 2020 in Lagos. Angela had to rush back to the U.S. because her own mom was sick. She was waiting for Michael’s spousal visa to get approved for the last four years and Michael is finally in America, which means Angela’s efforts were successful. Angela and Michael faced split rumors quite a few times while they were separated by distance. However, the 90 Day Fiancé couple is finally living their dream together in the U.S. Hopefully this is when Angela and Michael forget what happened in the past and start life anew.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
