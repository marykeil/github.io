## Literature Review

Warner Bros. has voiced a commitment to adapting more of its properties into video games, and some movie franchises are perfect for the medium.




Moving forward, part of Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s business strategy will seemingly be a commitment to transforming more of its biggest movie franchises into video games. With the widespread popularity of properties including Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and Batman, Warner Bros. is especially poised to profit in the gaming industry, but there are plenty of other properties the company owns that could make for engaging games.
Warner Bros. experienced enormous success in 2023 with significant video game releases such as the adaptation of Harry Potter, Hogwarts Legacy. The title has been one of the year&#39;s most successful games, exceeding one billion dollars in sales and over 15 million copies sold. Additionally, Warner Bros. enjoyed more success in the video game industry with the release of Mortal Kombat 1, which has sold close to three million copies since its launch in summer 2023. Although Warner Bros. owns a vast number of franchises ripe for similar success, a few absolutely must get an adaptation.
            
 
 Warner Bros Just Confirmed Our Worst Fears About Harry Potter &amp; Lord Of The Rings 
Recent comments from Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav don&#39;t bode well for the future of the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.












 








 10  Willy Wonka 
Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory (1971), Charlie And The Chocolate Factory (2005), Wonka (2023)
        

  Wonka  


  Release Date    December 15, 2023     Director    Paul King     Cast    Sally Hawkins , Olivia Colman , Keegan-Michael Key , Rowan Atkinson , Timothee Chalamet , Jim Carter     Genres    Family , Adventure , Comedy     prequel(s)    Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory    


Willy Wonka originates from Roald Dahl&#39;s 1964 children&#39;s novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and its sequel, 1972s&#39;s Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Portrayed by Gene Wilder, Johnny Depp, and most recently Timothée Chalamet, Willy Wonka is an eccentric character that could be very well suited to a video game adaptation, fulfilling Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav&#39;s wish of turning its properties into games (per VGC). Furthermore, his chocolate factory could be a perfect setting for a number of genres of games, ranging from a lighthearted children&#39;s movie tie-in to a psychedelic survival horror adaptation. The 2005 movie had a very poorly received tie-in game, but since the character is enormously popular and widely known, Warner Bros. could stand to make a fortune if it figures out how to successfully adapt this source of video game inspiration.
            
 
 Wonka: Release Date, Cast &amp; Everything We Know 
Timothée Chalamet will be starring in the 2023 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel, Wonka. Here&#39;s all the release, cast, and plot info so far.








 9  MonsterVerse 
Godzilla (2014), Kong: Skull Island (2017), Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)
        

  Godzilla (2014)  


  Release Date    May 16, 2014     Director    Gareth Edwards     Cast    Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Bryan Cranston , Elizabeth Olsen , Ken Watanabe , Sally Hawkins , Vera Farmiga , David Strathairn     Franchise(s)    Toho    


MonsterVerse is a multimedia franchise with an impressive roster of characters - most notably Godzilla and King Kong. While a number of Godzilla and King Kong games have been released in the past, most recent outings have been incredibly subpar, including one of the worst games of 2023, Skull Island: Rise of Kong. This outstanding franchise absolutely deserves a quality video game release. With Godzilla and King Kong on the MonsterVerse roster, the possibilities for a game adaptation of the franchise are seemingly endless. While an ARPG seems most likely, a MonsterVerse game could manifest in countless ways, even possibly a Mortal Kombat-esque fighting game in which players control the kaiju of their choice and take on a range of monstrous enemies.





 8  Ocean&#39;s 
Ocean&#39;s 11 (1960), Ocean&#39;s Eleven (2001), Ocean&#39;s Twelve (2004), &amp; More
        

  Ocean&#39;s Eleven  


  Release Date    December 7, 2001     Director    Steven Soderbergh     Cast    Brad Pitt , Don Cheadle , Julia Roberts , George Clooney , Matt Damon , Andy Garcia     Genres    Thriller , Crime     Sequel(s)    Ocean&#39;s Eight , Ocean&#39;s Thirteen , Ocean&#39;s Twelve    


Originally starring members of the iconic 1960s informal musical group, the Rat Pack, the Ocean&#39;s franchise of heist movies went on to find newfound popularity when it was remade in the early 2000s. With an unnamed prequel in production, Warner Bros. may attempt to adapt this exciting and entertaining franchise into a heist video game. Though likely more suave than Pay Day, an Ocean&#39;s video game would be an excellent stealthy alternative to the modern guns-blazing style of heist video games. The game could, similar to GTA 5 and like in the movies, focus the majority of the time on preparing for the heist and sourcing a crew of experts.





 7  Beetlejuice 
Beetlejuice (1988), Beetlejuice 2 (In Production), Beetlejuice (1989–1991)
        

  Beetlejuice  


  Release Date    March 30, 1988     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Catherine O&#39;Hara , Michael Keaton , Geena Davis , Alec Baldwin , Winona Ryder , Jeffrey Jones     Genres    Comedy , Fantasy     Franchise(s)    Beetlejuice 2    


Directed by Tim Burton, Beetlejuice is a 1988 fantasy horror comedy movie that spawned a popular stage musical and a short-running TV series in the late 1980s. With a sequel in development, it would be a perfect time for Warner Bros. to produce a video game featuring the manipulative miscreant, Beetlejuice. While Beetlejuice games have been produced in the past, they were in the early 1990s and, as a result, they do not possess a widespread appeal in the 2020s; consequently, fans of this side-splittingly funny franchise can only hope that Warner Bros. transforms this, one of its most underrated franchises, into an equally great video game.

 6  Friday the 13th 
Friday the 13th (1980), Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives (1985), Freddy vs. Jason (2003), &amp; More
        

  Friday the 13th  


  Release Date    May 9, 1980     Director    Sean S. Cunningham     Cast    Peter Brouwer , Adrienne King , Betsy Palmer , Jeannine Taylor , Kevin Bacon , Robbi Morgan , Harry Crosby     Genres    Horror , Mystery , Thriller     Franchise(s)    Friday the 13th    


Friday the 13th is a legendary franchise of horror/slasher movies with a mixed reputation when it comes to audience and critical reception - with 12 slasher movies in its catalog, it could be argued that the franchise has gone for quantity over quality. Despite this, the series, and its most famous antagonist, Jason Vorhees, have developed a cult following and a place in the pop-culture consciousness. While Jason has featured in a number of games, including an asymmetrical survival horror game that&#39;ll be delisted at the end of 2023, he has never had an officially licensed release that has been a smash hit. With the last release in 2017, it is about time that Warner Bros. released a new Friday the 13th video game.
            
 
 Why Friday The 13th Is Shutting Down Dedicated Servers 
Gun Media recently announced the upcoming closure of Friday The 13: The Game&#39;s dedicated servers. Here&#39;s why the publishers came to this decision. 








 5  Gremlins 
Gremlins (1984), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990), Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai (2023), &amp; More
        

  Gremlins  


  Release Date    June 7, 1984     Director    Joe Dante     Cast    Phoebe Cates , Corey Feldman , Zach Galligan , Hoyt Axton , Polly Holliday , Howie Mandel     Genres    Comedy , Fantasy , Horror     Franchise(s)    Gremlins 3    


The comedy horror franchise Gremlins spawned a string of games from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s; however, none of them hold up. With the animated television series Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai being so well received, both by critics and audiences, Warner Bros. could seek to capitalize upon this resurgence in popularity with a new game. Though it is difficult to envisage how it would manifest, a new Gremlins game could be an entertaining and exciting prospect for either adults or children, depending upon the direction taken. Ultimately, it would be phenomenal for new and long-time fans of the franchise to see these furry creatures back in a game.





 4  Mad Max 
Mad Max (1979), The Road Warrior (1981), Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), &amp; More
        

  Mad Max: Fury Road  


  Release Date    May 14, 2015     Director    George Miller     Cast    Tom Hardy , Charlize Theron , Nicholas Hoult , Zoe Kravitz , Hugh Keays-Byrne , Riley Keough , Courtney Eaton , Abbey Lee , Rosie Huntington-Whiteley     Genres    Action , Adventure , Thriller , Fantasy     Franchise(s)    Mad Max    


Mad Max&#39;s 2015 video game received mixed to average reviews from critics, and was not enormously successful with customers; however, with Furiosa coming out in 2024 and Mad Max: The Wasteland reportedly in production, it seems like a perfect time for Warner Bros. to consider returning this enduringly popular franchise back to the video game market. One of the best fictional depictions of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic wastelands, a future Mad Max game would be perfectly suited to an open-world Fallout-style RPG or even a more prosaic, story-driven first-person shooter along the lines of Battlefield or Call of Duty. Irrespective of genre, a Mad Max game could very easily be great.

 3  A Nightmare on Elm Street 
A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), &amp; More


 







  A Nightmare On Elm Street  


  Release Date    November 16, 1984     Director    Wes Craven     Cast    Heather Langenkamp , Robert Englund , Amanda Wyss , John Saxon , Johnny Depp , Ronee Blakley , Jsu Garcia , Lin Shaye     Genres    Horror     Franchise(s)    A Nightmare on Elm Street    


Though Freddy Kreuger has not played a prominent role in a video game since the 1989 NES flop A Nightmare on Elm Street, he has been a playable figure in a few games - most notably Mortal Kombat 10 and Dead by Daylight. While the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise has lied dormant since the underwhelming 2010 reboot, an excellent new A Nightmare on Elm Street video game would certainly help revitalize this legendary slasher movie franchise. Furthermore, there is enormous scope for how a game inspired by the franchise could be - perhaps similar to Dead by Daylight, or even an ARPG with Kreuger acting as the game&#39;s primary antagonist.

 2  The Matrix 
The Matrix (1999), The Animatrix (2003), The Matrix Resurrections (2021), &amp; More


 







  The Matrix Resurrections  


  Release Date    December 22, 2021     Director    Lana Wachowski     Cast    Brian J. Smith , Jada Pinkett Smith , Jessica Henwick , Jonathan Groff , Neil Patrick Harris , Priyanka Chopra Jonas , Max Riemelt , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Toby Onwumere , Keanu Reeves , Telma Hopkins , Carrie-Anne Moss , Christina Ricci     Genres     Sci-Fi , Action     Franchise    The Matrix    


Though The Matrix franchise is not unfamiliar with video game adaptations, each game so far produced on the source material has been abysmal - especially 2003&#39;s Enter the Matrix. As the franchise has been revived in recent years with The Matrix Resurrections, it would be a perfect time for Warner Bros. to put out a new game based on, or set in, the Matrix universe. Perhaps the franchise&#39;s most iconic figure, Neo, portrayed by iconic action film star Keanu Reeves would be willing to take part in the project - like he has famously done with CD Projekt RED&#39;s 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077 (and its 2023 DLC, Phantom Liberty), portraying Johnny Silverhand.
            
 
 &#34;Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists&#34; - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review 
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty&#39;s unpredictable spy-thriller story is full of jaw-dropping moments, and it&#39;s got the gameplay to match.








 1  It 
It Chapter One (2017), It Chapter 2 (2019), Welcome to Derry (In Production), &amp; More


 







  It Chapter Two  


  Release Date    September 6, 2019     Director    Andres Muschietti     Cast    Bill Hader , Isaiah Mustafa , James Ransone , Jay Ryan , Jessica Chastain , Andy Bean , James McAvoy , Bill Skarsgard     Genres    Horror , Thriller     Franchise(s)    IT    


It, originating as a Stephen King Novel in 1986, would make for an outstanding survival horror game. The It franchise features one of the most intimidating, indestructible, and scariest antagonists in literary fiction and movie history, the titular, shape-shifting, reality-manipulating, trans-dimensional, evil entity. Also known as Pennywise, It is a phenomenal antagonist and undoubtedly would have the ability to transition into a horror game boss. Beyond this, the unique cast of characters that face It in the books and movies could be employed in a game as survivors, in a manner similar to Dead by Daylight. Ultimately, It is one franchise that Warner Bros. needs to make into a game.
