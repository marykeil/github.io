## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a number of ways to provide buffs that help tip the dice in the party&#39;s favor. Here are some of the best and easiest to use.




Being based on the fifth edition rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it&#39;s not surprising there is a fair amount of dice rolling in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Whether for skill checks, saving throws or attacking the enemy, success or failure can come down to the roll of a die. Baked into DnD, and by extension, BG3, however, are a number of ways to manipulate dice rolls. Luckily, the game is filled with some great buffs that can help tip the odds back in the party&#39;s favor.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
Buffs in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 take many forms, from spells and equipment to class features and quest rewards. In fact, one of the most amazing buffs in BG3 comes from a very weird hidden quest, where players must volunteer for a flagellation session with a sadistic NPC. The buffs listed below, however, are much easier to get, further increasing the party&#39;s chances as they progress through the game’s three acts.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It) 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.












 








 10  Protection From Energy (Third-Level Abjuration Spell) 
Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, Wizards, Rangers, Oath of Ancients Paladins, Oath of Vengeance Paladins


 







Protection from energy is an often overlooked spell which grants a target resistance to one of five types of damage. The caster can choose when targeting themselves or an ally to give resistance to cold, acid, fire, lightning or thunder damage, which will halve any incoming damage of that type. This is great when protecting front line party members or healers to keep them up for a little longer in a fight. While protection from energy doesn&#39;t directly influence the party&#39;s dice rolls, it does tip any enemy rolls in the party&#39;s favor, ensuring that even crits are minimized.





 9  Invisible (Condition) 
Gained From Spells, Scrolls, Equipment, Certain Class &amp; Race Features


 







Invisible is a status condition granted to a character who has been turned invisible by various means. While this might sound obvious, the invisible status acts like a buff, granting the affected character advantage on attack rolls. At the same time, enemies will have disadvantage on attack rolls made against invisible targets, making this a useful but situational buff.





 8  Protection From Poison (Second-Level Abjuration Spell) 
Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Rangers
        

Protection from poison is a very situational spell, but one that the party will be glad they had if the moment arises. This spell not only stops all poison effects if the target has already been poisoned, but also grants advantage to saving throws against becoming poisoned. Best of all, protection from poison also gives resistance to any poison damage and lasts until a long rest.





 7  Happy (Condition) 
Unique To Astarion


 







Happy is an interesting status condition in BG3 that only affects one creature in the entire game: Astarion. Happy is gained whenever Astarion has taken a bite out of a target in battle and grants him plus one on all his attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. In order to unlock Astarion&#39;s bite attack, he will first have to bite the player character, which is the first step in his personal quest.





 6  Guiding Bolt (First-Level Evocation Spell) 
Clerics, Lore Bards, Seraphic Pugilist Gloves Found In Act 3
        

Guiding bolt is an offensive spell that all clerics should have in their arsenal. On top of doing 4d6 radiant damage at level one, which will increase by 1d6 for each level higher, the next attack roll against targets hit by this spell is made with advantage. This effect lasts for two turns, giving the rest of the party ample time to get those critical hits in. However, once the target has been hit with another attack, the advantage is lost.
Dame Aylin also has an attack that gives the same condition as guiding bolt called lunar flare. With this attack, Aylin deals 5d6 radiant damage immediately and 1–4 radiant damage for each turn when the guiding bolt condition is present.







 5  Resistance (Abjuration Cantrip) 
Clerics, Druids
        

Resistance is an often overlooked cantrip in BG3 and acts similarly to guidance, where it can be added as a buff during dialogue checks. Resistance grants a 1d4 bonus to all saving throws for 10 turns, and is useful both in and out of combat. Resistance is perfect when up against enemies such as Thisobald Thorm in Act 2, where multiple saving throws are needed to beat Thisobald without a fight. Otherwise, it requires careful planning to use resistance in combat and knowing what attacks the particular enemy has that require saving throws.





 4  Friends (Enchantment Cantrip) 
Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards, Eldritch Knights, Arcane Tricksters
        

Making friends isn&#39;t always easy, and in BG3 it can sometimes be difficult to persuade NPCs to agree with what the player character wants. Friends is a really overpowered cantrip that gives advantage on all Charisma checks against the target for 10 turns by charming them. This can be handy when trying to pass difficult checks, but be warned that not all NPCs will take kindly to friends being cast on them. If used too often on the same character or on a higher difficulty setting, such as Tactician or Honour Mode, NPCs may become hostile once the spell&#39;s effects have worn off.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.








 3  Thaumaturgy (Transmutation Cantrip) 
Clerics, Zariel Tieflings
        

For those social situations where diplomacy and persuasion have failed, a character might switch to intimidation tactics. Thaumaturgy is perfect for this, as this simple cantrip gives advantage to all intimidation and performance checks for 10 turns. This version is very different from the DnD thaumaturgy, but the basic premise is the same, with the cantrip boosting the caster&#39;s voice to intimidate or carry a performance.
Any bards who want to use thaumaturgy without multiclassing into cleric or playing as a Zariel tiefling can gain the cantrip by choosing the Magic Initiate: Cleric feat. This will allow them to use thaumaturgy for their performances to further boost their skill.







 2  Bless (First-Level Enchantment Spell) 
Clerics, Paladins, Lore Bards, Staff Of Arcane Blessing Found In Act 1, The Whispering Promise Sold By Volo
        

Bless is a classic cleric DnD spell that grants a 1d4 bonus to any attack rolls and saving throws. At first-level, bless can affect up to three targets but can be cast at higher levels to cover additional targets. Bless lasts for 10 turns but requires concentration, meaning that any character casting it will need to stay back unless they have high Constitution for making concentration checks.
Sweet Stone Features is a permanent condition that has the same effect as bless, and can be gained by buying a statue from Boney at the Circus of the Last Days.







 1  Guidance (Divination Cantrip) 
Clerics, Druids, Warlocks Via Pact of the Tome, Silver Pendant Found In Act 1


 







Guidance is perhaps the best known buff to dice rolls in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, almost becoming a meme within the community. Guidance adds a 1d4 bonus to any ability checks such as persuasion, investigation, or sleight of hand for 10 turns and can make all the difference to some of the higher checks needed late in the game. Guidance will most often be used in dialogue, where the ability to add the buff can be found at the bottom.
