## Literature Review

The new expansion for Disney Dreamlight Valley introduces an area called Eternity Isle, a place that you can move Villagers to from your own Valley.





When you purchase A Rift in Time, almost every addition from the Disney Dreamlight Valley expansion will become available for you to explore. There are no changes to The Valley&#39;s design based on what you have already customized before updating your game. Therefore, Eternity Isle will be a black slate for you to build from the ground up with whatever stylistic choices you want.




                  How To Unlock Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley   Eternity Isle is the new, separate, area introduced through Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Rift In Time expansion, but players will need help to reach it.   


 How to Put Villagers on Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley 
          

The easy way to move Villagers from The Valley to Eternity Isle is to simply take their Homes from their original location and place them in the realm your character is in. The menu option labeled &#34;Furniture&#34; lets you access the &#34;Homes&#34; of every character you&#39;re friends with. Every character you have unlocked in The Valley can have their residence transported to the Eternity Isle realm as long as you are there.



A good example of this moving process is finding the Ship of EVE in Disney Dreamlight Valley in the Furniture menus while you are on Eternity Isle, then press the &#34;Place House&#34; prompt to transfer the residence.







Keep in mind that moving a Home of any character takes it away from The Valley, but does not duplicate it for Eternity Isle. This means that you will have to move any House back to The Valley if you end up placing it on Eternity Isle at any point. Thankfully, this isn&#39;t too hard, since the steps for transporting a Home back to The Valley are the same for taking one away from the original hub in Disney Dreamlight Valley.

As you form more connections in the expansion, you may have a greater number of Houses to move around in between both islands available to you. As you move Villagers from The Valley to Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different arrangements to make either location exactly as you want it to be.
