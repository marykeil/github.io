 How to Earn Favor Fast in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora 
          

The best way to earn Favor fast with every Na&#39;vi Clan is to complete main and side quests, or bring back important materials connected to specific tribes.

You can check this Hometree symbol when hovering over items for sale to see how much it costs.



Not every Na&#39;vi tribe vendor will sell you items based on Favor, but instead demand other sources of currency that you may have to farm in different ways.

This may include hunting a particularly dangerous animal, or taking down RDA Outposts polluting the land. Progressing the main story is usually a consistent way to earn Favor with every tribe at some point.
