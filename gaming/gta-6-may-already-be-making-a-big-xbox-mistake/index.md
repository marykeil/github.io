# GTA 6 May Already Be Making A Big Xbox Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  GTA 6&#39;s upcoming release may pose a problem for the Xbox Series S, due to its lower specs and performance issues with more technically demanding games.   The Xbox Series S is significantly weaker than the Series X, which sometimes requires it to ditch certain game features.   Rockstar&#39;s previous games, like Red Dead Redemption 2, have had performance issues on lower-end consoles, suggesting that GTA 6 on the Xbox Series S may face similar problems.

## Literature Review

After a decade, GTA 6 has finally gotten an official announcement, but it could have a major problem with the current Xbox generation. Hereâ€™s why.




Grand Theft Auto 6 has finally been announced for a 2025 release, but that could be a problem for Xbox. The first trailer for GTA 6, a 90-second teaser featuring a quick peek at its story and setting, dropped a day early on December 4, 2023, after a leak saw it plastered across social media a day before its intended release. It at once confirmed and debunked many of the rumors that have been stewing about the upcoming game for the past decade, and even set a tentative window for its launch.




However, it&#39;s a broad one: GTA 6 won&#39;t be out until 2025, and just what part of 2025 remains to be seen. Judging by rumors about when the PS6 might be released, that&#39;ll probably be pretty late in the current console generation&#39;s life cycle. That sounds pretty similar to the strategy followed by GTA 5, which came to the seventh console generation on September 17, 2013, just two months shy of the PS4 and Xbox One&#39;s release dates in November of that year. Here&#39;s why that could be a problem for GTA 6.

                  What Platforms Will GTA 6 Release On? (Confirmed)   Rockstar Games has confirmed the release date for the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, and what platforms it will be on at launch.   


 GTA 6 On Xbox Series S Could Be A Mistake 
          




Thanks to its generally lower specs and performance issues with some more demanding games, the Xbox Series S might not be able to handle GTA 6. Xbox is the only console of the current generation to have two different models of massively different technical profiles: the Series X and the Series S.

There may be four different models of the PS5: two launch versions, one with a disk drive and one without, and two Slim versions along the same lines. But aside from the drive, all four models are pretty much the same internally, and as a result, it&#39;s rare for one to have performance issues the other doesn&#39;t. The Xbox Series X and S work differently, with the S having significantly lower specs as outlined below:

 Xbox Series X  Xbox Series S   12 Teraflops processing power  4 Teraflops processing power   Displays at true 4K HD  Displays at 1440p   16 GB RAM  10 GB RAM   1825 MHz GPU clock speed  1565 MHz GPU clock speed   560 GB/s memory bandwidth  224 GB/s memory bandwidth   






The Xbox Series S is significantly weaker than the Series X across several categories, and that can cause problems. Many games just don&#39;t run as well on the Series S as they do on the Series X. Some games even have features missing. And those two issues are rapidly worsening. Games are only going to get more demanding for the rest of this console generation, while the Series S continues to lag behind, and it just so happens that the GTA series has always been known for pushing the limits of its contemporary hardware.

Huge open worlds, groundbreaking levels of interactivity, innovative story mechanics - these are the things that Rockstar has always excelled at. If it&#39;s consistent, these are things GTA 6 will achieve, too. Will the Xbox Series S be able to handle that, or will GTA 6 have to curtail its ambitions in order to function on the console? Or is the Xbox Series S about to die, with GTA 6 as the final nail in its coffin?



 Xbox Series S Has Trouble Running Some Games 
          




The Xbox Series S&#39; lower overall capability has already posed a problem for certain games. The most recent and infamous example is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, apparently poised for an Xbox Series X/S release in (at this point, very) late 2023. It&#39;ll be feature-complete on Xbox Series X, functionally identical to the PC and PS5 versions with slightly different icons for button commands. But the Xbox Series S version of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 won&#39;t have local, split-screen multiplayer.

It makes sense: BG3 does let characters travel pretty far from one another, even allowing them to exist in entirely different areas simultaneously. Rendering two different maps, each replete with controllable party members, interactive objects, and roaming NPCs, on one console is demanding - apparently too demanding for the Xbox Series S. Developer Larian is working on a fix that provides hope for BG3 split-screen on Xbox. But for the time being, it looks like the feature will be absent on the Series X, at least when the game first launches.




Baldur&#39;s Gate and GTA are two very distinct series, but both BG3 and GTA 5 are known for breaking boundaries. It truly depends on what GTA 6 is like, both performance-wise and mechanically, but its Xbox Series S release could face a similar issue. GTA 6 could be missing features on the Xbox Series S, although it&#39;s too early to say just which ones. That wouldn&#39;t be fair, either to players using that console or to the overall perception of the game. Paying the same price for a lesser experience is never ideal, and missing features would negatively color players&#39; perceptions of GTA 6 as a whole.



 Other Rockstar Games Have Had Performance Issues On Lower-End Platforms 
         

Rockstar&#39;s games also have a track record involving issues on lower-end consoles. Its most recent major release, Red Dead Redemption 2, came out for the eighth console generation in 2018. By then, it was available both on the launch versions and the upgraded versions of the PS4 and the Xbox One. When it launched, players on those launch versions reported issues. They encountered more bugs, crashes, and framerate dips than players on the PS4 Pro or the Xbox One X/S. The worst offenders were Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s biggest, most crowded towns, places like Saint Denis and Blackwater where scores of NPCs line busy streets.




Now, that&#39;s RDR2, a game in which players spend lots of time roaming through wide, empty swathes of wilderness. The performance issues were a problem, but they weren&#39;t constant; they only occurred when players had to ride into town. By contrast, almost the entirety of the GTA series takes place in busy urban environments. So, if GTA 6 has similar performance issues on the Xbox Series S, they could be even more prevalent, occurring more frequently as players traverse crowded streets.

So what can be done? It&#39;d be wrong for GTA 6 to cut features just to fit on the Xbox Series S, especially if it&#39;s the same price across all platforms. But it also shouldn&#39;t skip the Series S entirely, becoming one of the first-ever &#34;Series X exclusives,&#34; as that&#39;d force players to either upgrade or miss the game entirely. Rockstar is unlikely to change GTA 6 just to squeeze onto the Series S. Still, it may have missing features or performance issues unique to the weaker console. The nature of Grand Theft Auto 6 on the Xbox Series S will only become clear closer to its 2025 release date.
