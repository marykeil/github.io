## Literature Review

The Last Train Home lets soldiers learn up to six roles at once. This allows them to support the team both in battle and aboard the armored train.





You are given Role Points at certain Rank increases. You also need to have some minimum Attributes - Fitness, Dexterity, Intelligence, Willpower, or Charisma - to unlock a brand-new Role. Even if the UI and tutorial tips are flashing messages that Role Points are unspent, you should save them until you reach those Attributes instead of using them on the first available option.





 The Right Roles for the Right Person 
          

Advancing a Role gives passive traits, attack skills, new weaponry, and also increases in Attributes. The final of those is important to keep in mind, as a character cannot have more than a score of 10 in a single Attribute. If two or more Roles would put them over that cap for free, it is best to spend bonus points elsewhere.



Every character in Last Train Home is a unique pre-made hero reflecting soldiers from the real tail end of World War I. They have one or two starting Roles, along with various Traits. These can make them better or worse fits for various Roles by altering their Attributes, giving situational bonuses, or a personality quirk.




Rifleman-Scout
The Rifleman is a powerful close or mid-range fighter, while the Scout can easily snipe from far away. This combination leads to a very deadly soldier in all situations. Even though Last Train Home has real-time with pause, the same combat system used in older Baldurâ€™s Gate titles, you might wish to play in full real-time. The Role pair requires a minimum of four Fitness, five Dexterity, and four Willpower to use.




They can use Bayonet Charge to rush up close and quickly slip away with Camouflage. They deal increased damage with the Focus passive, along with increasing damage with the Death Zone active skill. The character will gain an extra three Fitness, three Dexterity, and four Willpower for mastering both career tracks.

Scout-Medic
The Medic keeps allies alive or subdues enemies, but combing it with the Scout will allow them to sneak about undetected. This makes it even safer to rescue or help a fallen comrade without being attacked further. This Role pairing requires five Dexterity, five Intelligence, four Willpower, and four Charisma to utilize.

This character can first use Quick Feet to quickly move around and then switch into Camouflage to become fully unseen. The Scout-Medic can confuse enemies with Distract, then totally put them out of commission with Sleep Flask. Fully mastering both Roles will also grant three Dexterity, three Intelligence, two Willpower, and two Charisma.

Grenadier-Engineer
The Grenadier brings heavy artillery to the battlefield, including various types of explosives. Engineers can make such machinery right aboard the train without relying on shopping. This form of crafting and customization has similarities to adding a workbench to a ship in Starfield. The Role combination needs four Fitness, five Intelligence, and four Willpower to unlock.




On the battlefield, this character will be able to unleash powerful Grenades and lock down the area with Land Mines. These will greatly amplify the chaos during missions in Last Train Home. They will also become immune to the Shaken or Stunned debuffs via the Unshakable passive. On the train, they will discover new technology and make items at double the speed of their coworkers. Finally, they will gain a bonus of three Fitness, five Intelligence, and two Willpower.
