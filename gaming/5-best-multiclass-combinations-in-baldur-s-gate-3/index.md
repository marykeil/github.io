 10 Most Fun-To-Play Class Builds In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
When creating a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 character is can be tempting to try to optimize everything; however, some of the most interesting build put fun first.












 








 5  Jack-Of-All-Trades 
For Flexible Roleplaying


The Jack-of-All-Trades build takes all 12 classes and smashes them together in a chaotic mash-up of every archetype available in the game. This hilarious path takes advantage of how Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 limits your character to a maximum of Level 12 during any playthrough. The aptly named &#34;Jack-of-All Trades&#34; achievement can be earned if you complete this build for a single character in your party.
Players can also expect to unlock many class-specific dialogue options, which is excellent for flexible roleplaying. 

Knowing which order to pick classes is incredibly important for a Baldur’s Gate 3 Jack-of-All-Trades build, and it’s highly recommended that players use the following order:
 Fighter 
 Barbarian 
 Rogue 
 Bard 
 Paladin 
 Ranger 
 Cleric 
 Monk 
 Sorcerer 
 Warlock 
 Druid 
 Wizard 

Putting together every class in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has pros and cons, but remember that you are only Level 1 in each class. You get basic cantrips, melee skills, and a few spell slots for slightly stronger magic. You also receive many proficiencies with most weapons and armor, which gives you various options for approaching combat with this build.
        

Spells come in all shapes and sizes for the Jack-of-All Trades, including Eldritch Blast from the Warlock class, which is one of the strongest damage-dealing cantrips. The Cleric and Bard also give you plenty of support spells for healing, buffs, and debuffs to your enemies. Make sure to explore each archetype&#39;s options to craft a character with a ton of versatility for your run.
The Fighter and Barbarian are the most important classes due to the larger number of hit points you get from each class. Spellcasters typically have low health, so you want to start with an archetype that can survive difficult early-game encounters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Feel free to explore your own order if you wish to use certain spells for earlier Acts of the story rather than pure combat prowess.

 4  Rogue/Ranger 
The One Shot Build
        

The Rogue and Ranger class in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 use Dexterity as their primary stat, which lets them synergize abilities into a single build. Rogues are usually driven by stealth but lack the extra health needed to survive larger battles. The Ranger makes up for this weakness by granting your character a larger pool of HP while boosting your stealth-based damage through its own features.
The best Ranger subclass for this build is the Gloomstalker at Level 3. This path lets your character gain bonuses for movement, including a &#43;3 Initiative buff, thanks to the Dread Ambusher ability. 

The Assassin Rogue pairs the best with this strategy when you reach Level 3 by giving your character extra damage whenever they use Sneak Attack. Since the plan for this build is to be stealthy, you can use the Assassinate: Initiative feature to gain an Advantage on attack rolls against enemies who still need to take their turn in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
The single-target damage for this multiclass can be ridiculous, and you can even one-shot certain bosses in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 if you have the right plan. Most of the time, your character will go first in combat as well, which gives you plenty of chances to disable the toughest enemies before they can act. 





 3  Sorcerer/Warlock 
Buff Abilities
        

The gifted Sorcerer class in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 pairs well with the arcana bestowed by a Patron from the Warlock archetype. Sorcerers use Sorcery Points to buff powerful Metamagic abilities that can alter the effects of different spells. Some examples include Distant Spell to increase a spell&#39;s range by 50% or Heightened Spell to make enemies have a Disadvantage against saving throws forced by the magic you cast.
Sorcery Points can also restore spell slots for your character, allowing you to cast various magic before taking a Long Rest. 

Both of these classes rely on the Charisma stat for their spellcasting, which makes for a straightforward multiclass build centered around magic. The Wizard&#39;s reliance on Intelligence would only work better with either of these archetypes in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The Metamagic of the Sorcerer combines with the higher level magic cast automatically by the Warlock to bring out the potential of various spells.
One of the best spells possible for this build is Eldritch Blast, a magic exclusive to the Warlock class. When picking Eldritch Invocations for the Warlock class, select both Agonizing Blast and Repelling Blast to give Eldritch Blast extra damage and knockback. 

An overlooked aspect of this build&#39;s synergy is how a high Charisma stat works when you aren&#39;t fighting in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Skills tied to Charisma, like Persuasion, Intimidation, and Deception, can sway conversations across every Act of the game and even end some battles before they start. 





 2  Bard/Cleric 
A Powerful Support Build


Those looking to create an incredibly powerful support character should take aspects of the Bard and Cleric classes in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Buffs, debuffs, and eternally useful healing magic are readily available to both these archetypes, so it makes sense to put them together. This build can also deal huge Area of Effect (AoE) damage while giving other members of your party the help they need.
Check out the above video about Bard/Cleric from YouTube creator ItalianSpartacus to see how to create a character that focuses on healing better than nearly any other build in the game.
        

Bards, on their own, are a fan-favorite class with decent healing magic, but they often lack the abilities needed to survive challenging encounters. The Cleric adds some extra HP to your character and provides even more with their Domain subclass. For example, the Life Domain gives you proficiency with Heavy Armor and stronger healing spells, while the War or Tempest Domain can boost your damage.
If you want a build designed to fool or debuff your opponents with magic, the Trickster Domain could be an excellent option for the Cleric. The College of Lore and the College of Valour Bard work well with this subclass for different reasons. The Lore Bard specializes in stronger spellcasting, while the Valour subclass has better survivability with Medium Armor and Shield proficiencies.





 1  Fighter/Barbarian 
Best Tank Multiclass


The Fighter and Barbarian offer a multiclass build meant to do two things - deal damage and tank hits for your party. This synergy is perfected for the pure warrior and produces a character that is without equal for combat encounters of nearly any kind in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The extra actions of the Fighter pair ridiculously well with the Barbarian&#39;s signature Rage ability for extremely high damage every turn.
Action Surge from the Fighter class essentially gives your character two turns at the same time, while Second Wind lets you recover some health. These two core features combine with the damage resistance caused by the Barbarian&#39;s Rage to make you a whirlwind of pain that&#39;s hard to take down. Making more attacks and taking less punishment gives this build a lot of flexibility.
If you are playing Karlach as an Origin character, go ahead and watch the above video from Fextralife on YouTube to replicate this multiclass build.
        

The Battle Master Fighter subclass works best for this build due to Maneuvers or special attacks with different effects you can use during battle in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. These include disarming an enemy, knocking them back, or even tripping foes onto the ground. Rage makes these moves terrifying as you methodically cleave through enemy groups with tactical precision fueled by brute force.
The endless possibilities for the best multiclass combinations can surprise you and your party with their flexibility as you try to handle the tougher fights seen in later parts of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s expansive story.
