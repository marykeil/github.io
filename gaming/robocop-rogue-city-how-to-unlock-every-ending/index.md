## Literature Review

There are three different endings you can unlock in Robocop: Rogue City depending on the relationships you&#39;ve made with every major NPC character.




                  &#34;A Great Game &amp; Everything An Adaptation Could Wish For&#34; - RoboCop: Rogue City Review   Robocop: Rogue City delivers an inspired and enthusiastic take on the classic franchise, even if some of its budgetary constraints are apparent.     





 Spare The Old Man Ending 
          

Choosing to spare the Old Man leads to the good ending of Robocop: Rogue City, showing that somewhere inside, Officer Murphy still exists deep within Detroit&#39;s defender. Doing this will play a short cutscene where Robocop helps the Old Man from the rubble. Unfortunately, a fallen stone pillar causes the Old Man to return the favor, pushing you out of the way to save your life like you attempted to do for them.

While some may consider this ending lackluster or poor since it doesn&#39;t amount to much, the act of helping another feeds into the game&#39;s themes of the soul persisting even in machines like the Old Man or Robocop. The cutscene will continue after Robocop thanks the Old Man for saving him, showing how Murphy escapes the collapsing building. A montage will play after a news report, showing you the status of certain NPCs.




Every NPC you encounter has a different ending of their own tied to the decision you made. Depending on your choices and interactions with them, these can range from happy conclusions to disgraceful incidents or even tragedies. For example, this ending shows Dr. Olivia Blanche involved in a parking dispute with a hostile ED-209 unit and writing a book about her experiences deescalating the situation.



There are some consistencies between the endings that are always the same, including OCP&#39;s continuing construction of Delta City and cooperation with the Kanemitsu corporation on a future project.






 Leave The Old Man To Die Ending 
          

Choosing to leave the Old Man to die has Robocop turn around, refusing to aid the robot as it reaches out toward Murphy in one last act of desperation before the building&#39;s ruins fall on top of the machine, killing it. While this action isn&#39;t malicious, it does reflect the cold law enforcer robot you&#39;ve become, reflecting one of the two bad endings to Robocop: Rogue City. The relationships you&#39;ve built will change as a result of this choice.




The cutscene that plays is similar to the previous ending, with Robocop emerging from the OCP building&#39;s destruction at the last second. Only this time, the characters&#39; fates will not be as hopeful in the Media Report that happens shortly after. However, the newly re-elected Mayor Kuzak in Robocop: Rogue City will always claim to have no comment about Robocop&#39;s rights, a statement that can be understood better in this final path.

Some characters have endings unchanged from if you spared the Old Man, but other examples can be quite significant in Robocop: Rogue City. That same doctor from before, Olivia Blanche, could not convince the ED unit to stop, causing it to kill a civilian in a malfunctioning manslaughter. This causes her to spread fear and distrust about robots like Robocop patrolling the streets, painting a much bleak picture.



 Kill The Old Man Ending 
          




The other bad ending in Robocop: Rogue City almost makes you feel like you were playing something like the complete edition of Terminator: Resistance. You don&#39;t leave or help the Old Man this time, with Murphy choosing to rip out the wires the machine needs to function in a brutal cutscene after your choice. This destructive final end proves that Robocop is an arm of the law and can do nothing more.



Characters like Anne Lewis and reporter Samantha Ortiz do not react to Robocop&#39;s actions at the end of the story since they do not witness what you do to the Old Man.




Unfortunately, there are no real changes to the characters from the &#34;Let the Old Man Die&#34; ending, with many people ending up in the same place as before. It seems this choice was designed for those who wanted to end the final boss themselves and not let some rubble take the kill. Like before, the fates of any you formed relationships with seem to go poorly more often than good when you watch the Media Report in Robocop: Rogue City.






 Which Ending Should You Choose? 
          

Clearly, the good ending for sparing the Old Man is the best choice here since it shines a light of hope not only on Officer Murphy but on the rest of the individuals whose lives they affected as the titular Robocop. The final parts of the Media Report in Robocop: Rogue City show the people&#39;s opinions of Robocop, which range from gratitude and reliance on the officer to strange yet affectionate affirmations.

Despite any ending, the final shot of the game shows Robocop back with the police department alongside Anne Lewis, who plans to return to duty regardless of her injury. While the events of this story are over, there&#39;s no doubt that crime will continue on the streets. Even if you unlock every ending to Robocop: Rogue City, there will always be another tale of OCP&#39;s finest law enforcer taking down corruption one way or another.
