# One Missing Feature In Cyberpunk 2077 Could Go A Long Way In Improving Immersion


## SUMMARY 



  Many of Night City&#39;s residents have some kind of visible Cyberware enhancements, but V&#39;s physical appearance can&#39;t be changed to reflect this through their Cyberware in Cyberpunk 2077.   Players have expressed a desire for visible Cyberware on their character, similar to the spin-off anime protagonist who had visible enhancements.   Cosmetic Cyberware implants have been made available through mods, but unfortunately, console players can&#39;t access them.

## Literature Review

Players can immerse themselves in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Night City better than ever before, but one cosmetic feature could enhance this.




With several updates since Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2020 launch, players can immerse themselves in the shady criminal underworld of Night City better than ever before. However, adding one feature to the game&#39;s Cyberware and physical appearance mechanic could add yet another layer to this immersion.




Whether or not they are for combat purposes like the game&#39;s protagonist, V, most of Night City&#39;s residents have some kind of Cyberware enhancements. Some of these can be seen through NPC&#39;s physical appearances when roaming the city streets, with mechanical arms like Dexter Deshawn or Johnny Silverhand&#39;s, or some kind of cyber seams on their faces to show there&#39;s been more work done under the surface.



Some Cyberware is disguised with the cosmetic covering called RealSkinn. Some members of The Mox use this to hide their combat-ready enhancements and put on a more doll-like appearance for their clients.




                  The Best Cyberware in Cyberpunk 2077 (&amp; Where to Find Them)   In addition to clothing, players can upgrade V with Cyberware in Cyberpunk 2077 for extra passive abilities and features. Here are five of the best.

Unfortunately, when it comes to customizing V, it isn&#39;t possible to add visible Cyberware. Players can add the aforementioned seams to V&#39;s appearance, and various ports are available on his body for basic features such as shards or his personal link, as these are essential to the game&#39;s story and base mechanics. There isn&#39;t the option, however, to have more visible Cyberware, as most of V&#39;s enhancements have been done below the surface.

This was pointed out on the r/cyberpunkgame Subreddit by KooriGamer, who made a post saying &#34;Is it just me or do [you] guys also wish that the Cyberware would actually show up on [your] body?&#34; KooriGamer also accompanied this with an image of David Martinez, the protagonist from the spin-off anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners, who had various Cyberware enhancements that made him a deadly opponent in combat, such as Gorilla Arms and the Projectile Launch System.

David&#39;s physical appearance changed over time as he constantly added more Cyberware as he rose to power. Another character, Doc, commented on David&#39;s unique biology, which was able to handle such an extreme transformation - although only barely, as it did emotionally destabilize him and led to him collapsing on occassion, with both Doc and David&#39;s partner Lucy suggesting a downgrade - comparing his extensively modified body to that of the &#34;Night City legend&#34; and Arasaka&#39;s head of security, Adam Smasher, who underwent a full-body cyborg modification.




While V&#39;s Mantis Blades can appear on his arms when used in combat, and the Relic can create a holographic-esque overlay of Johnny Silverhand&#39;s metal arm at times, there aren&#39;t many other options for visible Cyberware to be used in the game, with most of the cosmetic customization for V&#39;s arms being available through clothing. This seems like an odd choice when compared to the rest of Mike Pondsmith&#39;s Cyberpunk universe, where there&#39;s a wealth of visible Cyberware on display.

                  Cyberpunk 2077: Fingers Ripperdoc Location &amp; Exclusive Cyberware   One of the trickiest locations to find in Cyberpunk 2077 is Fingers MD, a Ripperdoc vendor located within Japantown of the Westbrook District.

Other Redditors such as CptTombstone pointed out that there have been mods such as Arasaka Cyber Arms that allow players to equip Cyberware arms like clothing at any Ripperdoc across Night City. There is a wide variety of options available, with arms based on characters such as the boxer Aaron Waines, who players assist in Phantom Liberty, or various gangs across the city, such as the Valentinos, Tyger Claws, and other groups such as Trauma Team, Arasaka, or even Johnny Silverhand&#39;s band Samurai. The mod goes even further and allows players to customize Cyberware weapons such as the Mantis Blades and Monowire to change their color or add glowing effects to them.






The Arasaka Cyber Arms mod also includes the &#34;Deus Flex&#34; arm, which is based on Adam Jensen from the Deus Ex series, and ones based on other popular characters such as Batman and Iron Man.




While these mods are great, they are only available for those who play PC, meaning console players will be missing out, even with the recent Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition bundling the full game together with its Phantom Liberty expansion across current-gen consoles and PC. With the launch of the Ultimate Edition bundle came the 2.1 update, which also included the &#34;Romantic Hangouts&#34; feature, which seems to be based on and shares its name with a popular mod &#34;I Really Want To Stay At Your House&#34;. Therefore, it&#39;s clear that CD Projekt Red has been observing what has been popular within the modding community and is open to adding official versions of some of these features to the game, bringing them to all platforms.

Cyberpunk 2077 has already overhauled its Cyberware system with the 2.0 update, allowing players to add more than ever before. While the likelihood of it happening may be decreased as developers move onto other projects such as The Witcher 4 or Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s sequel, codenamed &#34;Project Orion&#34;, if CD Projekt Red were to take some inspiration from the cosmetic Cyberware mods and incorporate something similar into the main game - or add such a feature to the aforementioned sequel - this could go even further to immerse players in the Cyberpunk universe, with some of their mechanical enhancements being on display at all times even through Cyberpunk 2077s first-person perspective.
