## Literature Review

None of the Elite Four fights in The Indigo Disk are particularly easy, but they&#39;re also not all equal in the overall level of challenge.




The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet introduces a new Elite Four to the franchise, and this particular set steps up the difficulty from the base game by a significant margin. As the second and final part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero expansion, The Indigo Disk is focused on delivering a comparatively robust challenge to any teams that have made it this far. Since the BB League Elite Four can be fought in any order, it&#39;s best to have a clear idea of the challenge that each presents to build a proper team and pick a good order.
From the start of The Indigo Disk, the DLC places a big emphasis on double battles, and the Elite Four keep up this momentum, making for a series of fights that&#39;s fairly different from the norm. The full Elite Four roster is Crispin, Amarys, Lacey, and Drayton, with each member being associated with one of the four biomes in Blueberry Academy&#39;s Terarium. After battling the BB League Elite Four, the final challenge is Kieran, who returns from The Teal Mask in his role as the Blueberry League Club Champion with a team of high-level Pokémon to take down.

 5  Crispin Is The Easiest Of The Indigo Disk&#39;s Elite Four 
Fire-Type Team
        

None of the Elite Four in The Indigo Disk are necessarily easy, making for a consistently higher level of challenge than beating the Elite Four in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet base games, but Crispin is more easily countered than any other member. As a Fire-type user, Crispin&#39;s team is weak to Water- and Ground-type Pokémon, making it comparatively easy to assemble an effective team to use against him. The biggest hurdle is the inclusion of Exeggutor, who will prove effective against these general counters and can require a little more specific strategizing.
A Bug- or Flying-type Pokémon can be a good answer to Exeggutor, although the risk that they face in the double battle context can still be high with the surplus of Fire-types. Assembling all the necessary ingredients for a Super Spicy Sandwich in Crispin&#39;s Elite Trial might actually be more time-consuming than preparing for his fight, depending on how well-prepared a trainer is to take on high-level Pokémon. Crispin is appropriately ranked #5 in the BB League Club, so it&#39;s no surprise that he ultimately poses the least intense threat among his peers.





 4  Amarys Can Be A Hard Fight 
Steel-Type Team
        

Like Crispin, the #4 spot Amarys is another indication that the BB League Club ranking is fairly accurate, posing the second-easiest challenge for most teams in The Indigo Disk DLC. The big difference is that effectively optimizing to fight her requires a significantly more complex team arrangement than Crispin&#39;s battle does, as her line-up can cause a bit of trouble for choices that seem like they could be obvious counters.
            
 
 &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review 
The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.



One example of the pain that Amarys can induce is her Skarmory, which gets a strong defensive boost through the Rocky Helmet and the Sturdy ability while preparing to unleash the brutal Stealth Rock move that can devastate an enemy team. With a carefully prepared lineup, however, there&#39;s no reason that a high-level team can&#39;t effectively take on Amarys, and the fights from a couple other Elite Four edge her out in viciousness.





 3  Lacey Is An Unusual Elite Four Fight 
Fairy-Type Team


 







Lacey can be very scary, and for some teams she might ultimately cause even more trouble than Drayton does in The Indigo Disk. As the first Elite Four member to specialize in Fairy-type Pokémon, dealing with her isn&#39;t quite like dealing with any previous Elite Four member. In general, however, she&#39;s a bit easier to beat than the #1 and #2 ranked members of the Blueberry League Club.
Posion- and Steel-type Pokémon generally suffice as the main line of offense against Lacey, but Galarian Slowbro and Excadrill can complicate things a bit. It&#39;s not actually necessary to win any battles to complete her Elite Trial, which takes a quiz format instead. That being said, failing twice on any individual question will incur a battle instead, so it&#39;s still a good idea to be prepared before the Elite Trial.





 2  Drayton Is The Hardest Elite Four Member 
Dragon-Type Team
        

Despite Drayton&#39;s apparent laissez-faire attitude in some regards, the Indigo Disk Elite Four member with a Dragon-type team doesn&#39;t play around when it comes to battling. Fairy- and Ice-type are good counters to his team. There are a lot of tricky challenges to get through, however, including Sceptile&#39;s Weakness Policy that boosts its attack and special attack whenever it&#39;s being hit with super effective moves. Bringing plenty of healing items into a fight with Drayton is a must.

The new Pokémon in The Indigo Disk DLC are generally strong, but some come out ahead of others when all attributes are taken into consideration.



Drayton&#39;s Elite Trial is also the most intense in terms of combat, as it requires the use of Pokémon caught in the Terarium. Deploying a perfectly curated team from the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet base games, The Teal Mask, or trades won&#39;t work, so this particular part of the challenge requires greater adaptability. The actual fights aren&#39;t as difficult as the ones in the final battle with Drayton, but it&#39;s still nothing to scoff at.





 1  Kieran Is The Indigo Disk BB League Champion 
Balanced Team


 







Kieran takes the top spot in the Blueberry Club League, and it doesn&#39;t take much to see why. The trainer has gotten serious since beating him in The Teal Mask, and his team can be incredibly challenging to take down. In standard Champion fashion, Kieran has a well-balanced team that can&#39;t be as easily countered as any of the Elite Four, so strategizing is significantly more complex. With the right team, he may not be that much harder than Drayton, but figuring out how to find that balance isn&#39;t easy.
Unlike the BB League Elite Four, the lowest level among any of Kieran&#39;s Pokémon is 80, with Hydrapple representing the high point at 82. Wacan Berry and Focus Sash are both annoying items held by a couple of his Pokémon, so making the most of every turn is important to avoid losing too much ground. As an interesting side note, bringing Ogerpon into the battle results in some unique dialogue. Luckily, Ogerpon is a solid choice to use against Kieran&#39;s challenging team, so there&#39;s no need to forfeit efficacy against Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk&#39;s Champion.
