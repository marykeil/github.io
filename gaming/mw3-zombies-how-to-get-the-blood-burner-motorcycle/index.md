## Literature Review

The Blood Burner Motorcycle is a nearly indestructible, talking vehicle in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies you can get when dropping into the apocalypse.





Another name for the Blood Burner is &#34;Dark Aether,&#34; which refers to the name of the entity that talks to you whenever you ride the motorcycle. Depending on your performance settings for Modern Warfare 3, you may not be able to hear the bike speak at first when you begin to drive the vehicle. Make sure to turn your volume up to hear the voice of Dark Aether, which can be haunting and soft compared to the warfare and zombie sounds.

 How to Find the Blood Burner Motorcycle in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

Unfortunately, the Blood Burner motorcycle spawns randomly and cannot be found unless you come across it naturally during a deployment. Every time you drop into Urzikstan, the bike is in a different location than before, making it extremely difficult to get without luck. Hopefully, you&#39;ll run into the vehicle at least once during your 45-minute time limit on the map as you explore regions for contracts in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.

If you are fortunate enough to come across Blood Burner during a match, you can rest assured that the bike will never really get damaged. The motorcycle is practically invincible, taking little to no damage from attacks even by the most deadly of the undead in MW3 Zombies. In addition, you have an ability called Aether Pulse, where the bike releases a small shockwave around itself that kills most zombies nearby.






The Blood Burner instantly kills almost any zombie it hits, making it perfect to get the Gravestone achievement that asks you to take out 100 zombies by running them over with a vehicle.

Another useful trait of the motorcycle is how it can drive across water, letting you traverse the oceans on the edge of Urzikstan. No river, lake, or any other watery obstacle can stand in your way as you glide over the waves in MW3 Zombies. This can be an incredible way to avoid zombies that can&#39;t swim, giving you an opportunity to retreat to a location where you can heal before attacking difficult zones like an Infested Stronghold.

Once you get the Blood Burner motorcycle in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, you&#39;ll have one of the most powerful tools to complete almost any mission you or your squad pursue.
