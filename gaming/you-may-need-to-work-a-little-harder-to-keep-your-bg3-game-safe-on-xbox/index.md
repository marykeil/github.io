## Literature Review

Months after release, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is available on every platform it was announced for, but some versions are still having very major issues.




Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has now been fully released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, one major issue is causing some players to lose large amounts of progress on certain platforms. First released on PC in August 2023 after a lengthy early access period, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 faced some delays when being ported to consoles, especially regarding the Xbox version of the game, which didn&#39;t launch until December 7 the same year. And although BG3 is an especially large and ambitious RPG, the game still has a few major issues to iron out, especially for some console versions.




Despite being ported to the PS5 relatively quickly, with the PlayStation version of BG3 releasing just barely over a month after its initial PC launch, the game faced much greater delays when it came to the Xbox port. Owing to some difficulties with developing the game for the less powerful Xbox Series S, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Xbox release took until the end of the year to finally launch, when it was announced as a surprise release at The Game Awards 2023, where BG3 also won Game of the Year. Unfortunately, although the game is now playable on Xbox, players are still experiencing some major save issues on the platform which aren&#39;t present on other versions.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Has A Major Save Issue On Xbox 
         




Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 mostly functions as intended on the Xbox Series X/S, an issue with saves has players at risk of losing multiple hours of progress each time they exit the game. As outlined in a post by Larian Studios on X (formerly Twitter), save data can be lost even after saving and exiting the game due to an Xbox firmware issue. Although the issue was known shortly after release, with several Xbox players noticing their lost progress, it has yet to be fixed, in part due to &#34;everyone working at a lower capacity&#34; over the holidays, as stated by Larian.

 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Save File Issue On Xbox Has A Workaround 
          




Luckily, in the meantime, there is a workaround outlined by Larian Studios in the same post, involving the cross-save functionality offered by the Larian account system. Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t a complete fix for the issue, as the save error can still occur, but it does allow players to recover their five most recent saves from the Larian servers, preventing the permanent loss of progress. For any players who own Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 on other platforms, it might be best to wait for fixes to the firmware issue from Microsoft before playing the game on Xbox.


 

Despite the long wait for the Xbox version of BG3, the save issue stands out as a major problem that needs fixing before the port can be considered to be on par with other versions of the game. While there is a workaround to avoid losing progress for players who can only play the game on the Xbox Series X/S, the issue persisting a major blow to its potential parity with the PC and PS5 versions of the game. Fortunately, as one of the most successful and prominent releases of 2023, it&#39;s fairly likely that a fix for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Xbox save issues will be implemented fairly quickly as the holidays end.
