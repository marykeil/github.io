# One Marvel s Spider-Man 2 Tie-In Product Can Really Improve The Graphics


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 was part of a unique cross-promotion with Warby Parker, a prescription eyeglasses retailer.   There are six different Warby Parker glasses, based on four separate characters from Spider-Man 2.   Eyeglasses are an odd promotional item for a Spider-Man game, but they&#39;re far more practical and interesting than many other gaming collectibles.

## Literature Review

Gaming fans are used to seeing a variety of merchandise tied to popular titles, but one Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 licensed product differs from the rest.




Very few video game promotional products can actually make graphics better, but the official Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 eyeglasses from Warby Parker can do just that. A tie-in between prescription glasses and a video game release is a different breed of cross-promotion from the norm, as fans usually see products aimed at children, like fast food restaurant toys or limited run cereals. This makes the Warby Parker collaboration stand out, since prescription eyeglasses are extremely practical, and can certainly do more to improve video game graphics than a new television.




There are a lot of secrets in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and staying up to date with eye exams and appropriate corrective lenses can help players spot everything the game hides. The choice of a Spider-Man game for a custom line of eyewear may seem odd to some, as the character is less associated with glasses than other comic heroes like Superman. Still, the approach to adapting the game’s characters into frames was fairly novel. When revealed at the 2023 New York Comic Con, the crossover made a point to debut glasses were made to embody Peter Parker, Miles Morales, Mary Jane, and Venom.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.   


 Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Is An Odd Choice For A Glasses Line 
          




There are two pairs for Parker and Morales, one to represent their civilian identities, and one for their alter-ego of Spider-Man, adding up to six pairs of eyeglasses in total. The civilian Parker and Morales-inspired frames are for standard prescription eyeglasses, and the remaining four are sunglasses. These all feature the expected style and comfort of Warby Parker glasses, and prices that are comparable to similar frames bought from an optometrist&#39;s office. The sunglasses are also available with prescription lens for an additional fee. Other optional add-ons include an anti-fatigue coating to reduce the eye strain of screen time, which could help with marathon gaming sessions.


 

Other game franchises would certainly be a more intuitive fit for officially licensed eyewear, like the near-flawless Persona 4 Golden, where each of the heroes wears special glasses that allow them to see through the fog of the Midnight Channel’s secret domain. This makes Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feel a bit arbitrary in its selection for a glasses line, but that is still not unwelcome. Video game fans should be getting their annual eye exams routinely, if possible, and having an option to buy quality frames that are associated with a beloved video game is an intriguing proposal. More practical products with video game branding could be well-received.






Officially licensed Persona 4 fashion glasses were sold in Japan, but these did not include prescription lenses.




This year also saw the body care brand Lush doing a collaboration with the Super Mario Bros. movie, offering Mario-themed soaps and shower gel. Taken too far, this style of promotional tie-in could begin to feel patronizing, if video game fans are offered Master Chief-branded deodorant or Sonic the Hedgehog floss. Still, self-care is important, and pragmatic products that embrace a game’s fandom are a welcome change of pace from an endless line of Funko Pops. The eyeglasses are thankfully understated in their design, with text identifying the Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 connection on the interior of the frames, but superficially, not unlike other Warby Parker glasses.



 Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Glasses Shake Up Predictable Marketing 
          




The success of the collaboration will likely determine if there are more game-themed eyeglasses in store. Since Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 foreshadows Carnage making a future appearance, if the Warby Parker line sells well, then Carnage glasses could be added to the selection at some point. A line of eyewear promoting a video game, especially one that is a sequel to a comic book-licensed title, is obviously a quirky curiosity more than a product most fans would have asked for. Given that extensive video game sessions could contribute to eyestrain, along with the rest of the screen time endemic to modern life, it is a surprisingly appropriate pairing.

                  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Is Setting Up Way Too Many Villains For The Sequel   Could Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 have the same problems as Sony&#39;s Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movies due to juggling too many villains?   

The hype surrounding a major video game release can become predictable, with the usual staggered trailers and possibly a demo prior to launch. Gaming promotional tie-ins can become just as rote, but the Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 eyeglasses at least show Warby Parker and Marvel trying something different, as a well-crafted piece of prescription eyewear that bears a game’s name on its frames holds more practical value, and uniqueness, over another figurine or collectible soundtrack release.
