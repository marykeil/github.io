## Literature Review

Gouging Fire is a new Legendary beast to find in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but it can be hard to catch this ancient form of Entei.





Gouging Fire is a Paradox Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk and is, therefore, only available in one game version. Pokémon Scarlet is the only place to obtain this Entei variant, but you could receive one in a trade if you only have Pokémon Violet. The other ancient Legendary Dogs, like Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, are also exclusive to the game that holds Gouging Fire.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Raging Bolt in Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Raging Bolt is a new Paradox Pokémon introduced with the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet. Here’s how to unlock it and Raging Bolt’s location.   


 How To Unlock Gouging Fire in Pokémon Scarlet 
          

You need to register 200 Pokémon in the Blueberry Academy Pokédex and report this information to the photographer, Perrin, to make Gouging Fire appear in Area Zero. This is easily done by catching all the new Pokémon added to The Indigo Disk DLC or evolving creatures you already have. Many Terarium quests you can pursue introduce your character to species you may not have encountered before.



One Terarium quest asks you to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of a biome and increase the different types of Pokémon found there. This should help you register enough creatures to unlock Gouging Fire.







Once you talk to Perrin at the Subtropical Savannah biome near the Terarium, Gouging Fire only appears once in the depths of Area Zero. Those who can&#39;t find Perrin may have to complete the quests tied to the NPC in The Teal Mask expansion&#39;s story. Gouging Fire shows up near a broken radar at the top of a waterfall you can only reach by unlocking flight in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.

The Entei variant is Level 75, like most Legendaries you can come across, and has a capture rate of 3.9%. Use status effects special types of Pokéballs, and reduce the Pokémon&#39;s health to increase your capture chances. Make sure to save before the battle if you accidentally knock out the beast during your fight in Pokémon Scarlet.

Those who manage to find and catch Gouging Fire in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC will have an extremely strong companion to defeat nearly every trainer you could ever challenge.
