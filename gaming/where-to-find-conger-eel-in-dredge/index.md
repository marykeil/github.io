## Literature Review

Conger Eel are essential fish to find in Dredge to get several rewards, including some tied to a &#34;Best Before&#34; pursuit given by a resident of Ingfell.





As you embark on your boat in pursuit of Conger Eel, ensure you have a Rod capable of fishing in Shallow Water. The fish you&#39;re after only swim at a maximum depth of 2 meters, making them creatures that thrive close to the top of the water. While these Eels may not be floating on the surface like Messages in a Bottle in Dredge, they do spawn at locations that are closer to sources of land than other fish.

 How To Find Conger Eel 
          

The elusive Conger Eel happens to show up around the Gale Cliffs, usually along the perimeter of the location during the night only. Zones N4 through O4 on your map are the best places to catch a few Eels, as well as a small section of the P4 area on your map. Some areas are blocked off by debris and may only be accessed once you destroy the rubble with items called Packed Explosives in Dredge. 



Packed Explosives can be bought from the Retired Whaler character in the Little Marrow Whaling Yards to help you get past the obstacles blocking Conger Eel fishing spots.




You may need to invest in the best engines in Dredge to navigate through the dangerous waters that threaten to knock you off course near sources of Conger Eel. The center of O4 has the highest population of fish you want, but you will likely have some trouble trying to stay put and catch Eel at the same time. Each Conger Eel you catch takes up five slots in your inventory in a 4x2 space that could be tricky to organize. 






 How To Use Conger Eel 
          

When you capture at least one Conger Eel, it can be used for the &#34;Best Before&#34; Pursuit side quest given by the Ingfell Resident, also found at the Gale Cliffs. This NPC asks you to deliver an &#34;aged&#34; Conger Eel to her since the fish is considered a rare delicacy in that state. You have to rest until one of your Eels is considered &#34;rotting&#34; for the Resident to accept the fish and reward you for your efforts.

Turning in a Conger Eel this way lets you collect $150 from the Ingfell Resident, which is around three times the normal selling price of the fish. Be careful not to confuse the Congrel Eel with its Aberration counterpart, the Sprouting Eel, which you might find as the oceans become stranger and stranger in Dredge as you continue your journey.
