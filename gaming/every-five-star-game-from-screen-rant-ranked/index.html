  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Screen Rant Gaming has reviewed hundreds of games since our inception, and we&rsquo;ve created a definitive five-star game ranking to celebrate our 20th anniversary.
While every game on this list received a perfect score, the ranking takes into account various categories like gameplay, story, and industry impact.
The article highlights five-star games like Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Uncharted Legacy of Thieves, Elden Ring, and more.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>In Screen Rant&rsquo;s gaming history, we&rsquo;ve awarded five-star reviews to many incredible games. Here&rsquo;s our definitive ranking of every top-scoring game.</p>
<p>Since the inception of Screen Rant Gaming, we&rsquo;ve reviewed hundreds of games from AAA Game of the Year winners to sleeper indie hits. While no game is perfect, there&rsquo;s many that have still earned a five-star rating from our reviewers thanks to their impressive gameplay, story, and design. While an incredibly difficult task to rank these phenomenal titles, our Gaming editors have collectively decided how these industry-shaking games stack up against each other, resulting in the definitive five-star game ranking in celebration of Screen Rant&rsquo;s 20th anniversary.
When reviewing a game, Screen Rant&rsquo;s reviewers consider a wide range of categories, not only the gameplay, but also the graphics, bugs, accessibility, approachability, world design, characters, and more. However, what our reviewers can&rsquo;t predict is each game&rsquo;s impact on the industry. Some of our five-star games, while older, have truly stood the test of time, amassing countless players and remaining part of the cultural gaming landscape even years after their release. Others have had less longevity or less of an impact, which is one of the wider considerations of our ranking. With this list, we aren&rsquo;t only considering the games on an individual basis, but also their impact since launch.</p>
<p>20 Best Video Games Of The Last 20 Years
In honor of Screen Rant&rsquo;s 20th anniversary, the Gaming team has selected the best 20 games of the last 20 years, with one entry per year.</p>
<p>36  Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (2022)
Nintendo Switch</p>
<p>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</p>
<p>Franchise    Fire Emblem     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    June 24, 2022     Developer(s)    Omega Force     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action , Hack and Slash</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Released in 2022, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is a spin-off of the 2019 hit, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Houses. As the title suggests, the game uses the same mechanics as Dynasty Warriors and The Legend of Zelda spin-off, Hyrule Warriors. Three Hopes garnered generally very favorable reviews at launch, with its current Metacritic rating standing at 80.
In Screen Rant&rsquo;s five-star review, we praised its strategy mechanics and combat, stating: &ldquo;The game is a great choice for those who enjoy real-time combat or past Fire Emblem titles, as well as fans of Fire Emblem: Three Houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>35  Uncharted Legacy of Thieves (2022)
PS5, PC</p>
<p>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</p>
<p>Publisher    Sony Interactive Entertainment, PlayStation Studios, Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe, PlayStation Mobile Inc.     Genre    Adventure, Action     Platform    PS5</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Another five-star title from Screen Rant in 2022, Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection bundles together Uncharted 4: A Thief&rsquo;s End, and its standalone expansion, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Both games were remastered for this PS5 release, with additions like Fidelity Mode, 3D audio, improved framerate, and DualSense features. Both Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy are considered to be two of Naughty Dog&rsquo;s best games in the Nathan Drake saga, with the latter often overlooked due to its smaller size and framing as DLC.
In our review of Legacy of Thieves, we noted: &ldquo;Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection is authentic, exciting, and well worth exploring, neatly tying together the series past and potential future in the best version of both to date.&rdquo; The title currently sits at 87 on Metacritic.</p>
<p>34  Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl (2021)
Nintendo Switch</p>
<p>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl</p>
<p>Franchise    Pokemon     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    November 19, 2021     Developer(s)    ILCA     Publisher(s)    The Pokemon Company , Nintendo</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl reimagine Generation 8&rsquo;s Diamond &amp; Pearl with an all-new Chibi aesthetic, 3D graphics, and new additions such as the Underground. The dual-release launched in 2021 to mixed reception, with plenty of fans unhappy with what was deemed divisive graphics and overly easy battles. Remakes will always draw comparisons to their original releases, and with particularly nostalgic IPs such as Pokémon, it can be hard for new titles to stack up to the originals.
At Screen Rant, however, we thoroughly enjoyed our time with the game, calling it: &ldquo;a perfect starting point that bridges the gap between classic and modern Pokémon games. The quality-of-life additions make the game more accessible without making it feel bloated, the art style is simplistic and cute, and the gameplay mechanics will keep players moving through the adventure with ease.&rdquo; Metacritic has both games at a score of 73.</p>
<p>33  Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter Rise PC (2021, 2022)
Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Rise</p>
<p>Franchise    Monster Hunter     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 26, 2021     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Action RPG</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s 5-Star Review (Nintendo Switch)
First launching on Nintendo Switch in 2021, Monster Hunter Rise took the world by storm with its beautiful worlds, exciting combat, and hundreds of hours of gameplay. On Switch, Rise truly put the console to the test with features like the verticality-adding Wirebugs, Rampage Missions, and Palamute mounts. When the game later released on Xbox, PS5 and PC, it truly shone with its impressive visuals and worlds.
In Screen Rant&rsquo;s Nintendo Switch review of Monster Hunter Rise, we said: &ldquo;This is the game that the Monster Hunter franchise should have been all along. The annoying parts of the experience that were retained due to tradition have finally been stripped away, leaving a polished, enjoyable experience for newcomers that will make long-time fans equally happy.&rdquo; Metacritic has the game at a score of 88 on Nintendo Switch.

<p>32  Carrion (2020)
All Platforms</p>
<p>Carrion</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Linux , macOS , Nintendo Switch , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Amazon Luna , PlayStation 5     Released    July 23, 2020     Developer(s)    Phobia Game Studio     Publisher(s)    Devolver Digital     Genre(s)    Action , Horror , Puzzle</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
The self-titled &ldquo;reverse horror game&rdquo; of 2020, Carrion allows players to take control of a horrifying pixelated mass whose aim is to feast on flesh while escaping from the underground facility it was created in. Praised for its unique premise, gruesome art style, and lack of hand-holding, Carrion amassed a strong following of fans who enjoy its very frank and unsettling absurdity.
In Screen Rant&rsquo;s review, we said: &ldquo;In certain games, it&rsquo;s a nightmare to drop in without any sort of tutorial, but Carrion is the rare exception that learns from the mistakes of others. The creature&rsquo;s toolset grows with every stage, but there&rsquo;s never more than one or two ways to solve any problem. The answer isn&rsquo;t always obvious, but any halt in progress come from players not using the creature&rsquo;s full potential rather than unruly difficulty spike. [&hellip;]The whole vibe is enjoyably upsetting, a truly singular journey that no player will soon forget.&rdquo; The game currently has a score of 75 on Metacritic.</p>
<p>31  Backbone (2021)
All Platforms</p>
<p>Backbone</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    June 8, 2021     Developer(s)    EggNut     Publisher(s)    Raw Fury     Genre(s)    Narrative , RPG</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
2021&rsquo;s post-noir detective adventure Backbone features a compelling narrative and unique art style. Playing as private detective Howard Lotor in the dystopian city of Vancouver, BC, players must solve what appears to be a simple case - until the plot thickens. Featuring stealth, puzzles, and some classic point-and-click gameplay, Backbone excels in both its design and story.
In Screen Rant&rsquo;s review, we said: &ldquo;Backbone is a must-play GOTY contender that deserves every bit of mainstream recognition it receives, and exceeds the usual reach of its genre, making for a compelling experience that even those with little interest in point-and-click adventures will find difficult to put down.&rdquo; The game has a score of 72 on Metacritic.</p>
<p>30  Streets of Rage 4 &amp; Mr. X Nightmare DLC (2020, 2021)
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC</p>
<p>Streets of Rage 4</p>
<p>Franchise    Streets of Rage     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PC     Released    April 30, 2020     Developer(s)    Dotemu     Publisher(s)    Dotemu     Genre(s)    Fighting</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review (Streets of Rage 4)
Streets of Rage 4 released in 2020 and was followed by its Mr. X Nightmare DLC in 2021. Both the base game and its follow-up content more than live up to the Streets of Rage name, offering fresh yet familiar combat with an all-new art style. Winning over fans both new and old, the Metacritic score for the base game is an impressive 84, while the DLC sits even higher at 88.
In our review of Streets of Rage 4, we noted: &ldquo;The challenge of reviewing Streets of Rage 4 is that most every single aspect of the game is easily worth a thousand words, whether it’s the excellent new musical themes, the fantastic elevator sections, how each level’s lighting affects visual shading on the heroes (even on the retro characters), or the heavy-duty challenge of mania difficulty.&rdquo;

<p>29  Kentucky Route Zero (2020)
All Platforms</p>
<p>Kentucky Route Zero</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Android , Linux , macOS , Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    January 28, 2020     Developer(s)    Cardboard Computer     Publisher(s)    Annapurna Interactive     Genre(s)    Interactive Narrative , Point-and-click</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Seven years after its first Act released in 2013, Kentucky Route Zero concluded its story in 2020 and the wait was certainly worth it. The game follows Conway, a delivery driver for an antique store in Kentucky. The premise is simple: Conway must deliver a parcel to Dogwood Drive, but it&rsquo;s the journey in which the heart of Kentucky Route Zero lies. Focused more on characters and their stories than puzzles, this is one title that has stuck with many players, earning a Metacritic score of anywhere from 81 to 90, depending on the Act.
In our review, we described Kentucky Route Zero as &ldquo;equal parts the abstract Americana of David Lynch and the magic realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez; a world of wreckage and loss, but with the potential for the growth of something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28  Eastward (2021)
Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PC</p>
<p>Eastward</p>
<p>Platform(s)    macOS , Nintendo Switch , PC , Xbox One     Released    September 16, 2021     Developer(s)    Pixpil     Publisher(s)    Chucklefish     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , RPG</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Eastward&rsquo;s beautiful visuals and call-backs to classic titles like Earthbound made the game an instant hit when it released in 2021. Following the story of father-daughter duo John and Sam, players will explore, cook, and battle their way through the magical world of Eastward in a wonderfully charming title for RPG fans. The game&rsquo;s art style is complimented by a strong script and memorable music, all of which culminate in an unmissable 5/5 experience for us, with an 82 on Metacritic.
In our review, we said: &ldquo;For RPG fans, Eastward is the real deal, and it’s an unmissable and impressive feat of indie design that deserves plenty of recognition amongst a sea of bigger releases in 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27  Street Fighter 6 (2023)
PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S, PC</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6</p>
<p>Franchise    Street Fighter     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    June 2, 2023     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Fighting</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Capcom&rsquo;s latest entry in its iconic Street Fighter series launched in 2023 to rave reviews, with an impressive 92 on Metacritic. The game adds more approachable ways to play thanks to its Modern and Dynamic control styles, but those who adore the complexity of classic Street Fighter can still make the most of this release thanks to its Classic mode. With new and returning features like Drive Impact, World Tour, and Fighting Grounds, there are plenty of modes to explore in Street Fighter 6.
In Screen Rant&rsquo;s review, we summarized saying: &ldquo;With everything that Street Fighter 6 includes, it&rsquo;s set the bar incredibly high for future fighting games. [..] A well-balanced roster of characters and new control options helps Street Fighter 6 stand tall as an excellent entry point for fighting games, while also containing the depth and precise gameplay that pros expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26  Forza Horizon 4 (2018)
Xbox, PC</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 4</p>
<p>Franchise    Forza Horizon     Platform(s)    PC , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    October 2, 2018     Developer(s)    Playground Games     Publisher(s)    Microsoft Studios     Genre(s)    Open-World , Racing</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s 5-Star Review
Forza Horizon 4 is still considered one of the best racing simulators on the market, despite releasing back in 2018. Playground Games used cutting-edge technology to bring its version of Great Britain to life, with the result being a near-flawless replica that&rsquo;s perfect not only for high-octane racing, but also just for exploring and taking in the views. The game earned an impressive 92 on Metacritic - the same score as 2021&rsquo;s Forza Horizon 5.
In our review, Screen Rant stated: &ldquo;Everything - from the race-track design and the seasons to the graphical advancements and showcase events (which have been amplified for the sequel) - have been significantly improved upon, thereby turning Forza Horizon 4 into arguably the best open world racing game in many, many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (2022)
Nintendo Switch</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</p>
<p>Franchise    Xenoblade Chronicles     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    September 30, 2022     Developer(s)    Monolith Soft     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Open-World</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
2022 saw the release of the much-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3, a game that earned itself an 89 on Metacritic. The third mainline entry into the beloved JRPG series, Xenoblade Chronicles 3successfully toes the line between continuing the story of its predecessors, while also being approachable for those new to the franchise. The game follows Noah and Mio who find themselves reborn as Ouroboros with the power to become mech-like.
Screen Rant described the game as: &ldquo;a dizzying achievement of scale and substance, successfully merging the tactical combat and planning of Xenoblade Chronicles with the variation and captivation of the sequel&rsquo;s open world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24  Octopath Traveler (2018)
All Platforms</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler</p>
<p>Franchise    Octopath Traveler     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PlayStation 5 , PC , Steam , Stadia     Released    July 13, 2018     Developer(s)    Square Enix Business Division 11 , Acquire     Publisher(s)    Square Enix     Genre(s)    RPG , JRPG</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Octopath Traveler revolutionized the JRPG genre with its charm and style, paving the way for a slew of new games utilizing &ldquo;HD-2D&rdquo; visuals. With eight playable characters, each with their own history and story, it&rsquo;s easy to spend hours within the world of Osterra as you unlock everything the game has to offer. The Metacritic score stands at 83, being only slightly bested by the game&rsquo;s 2023 sequel, Octopath Traveler 2, at 94.
Screen Rant said of Octopath Traveler: &ldquo;It’s a sprawling, massively time-consuming delight, managing to both honor its forebears as well as provide just the right amount of innovation, and features one of the best combat systems in recent memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23  GRIS (2018)
All Platforms</p>
<p>GRIS</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Android , iOS , macOS , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    December 13, 2018     Developer(s)    Nomada Studio     Publisher(s)    Devolver Digital     Genre(s)    Adventure , Platformer</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
2018&rsquo;s beautifully breathtaking platform-puzzle gameGRIS is still considered to be one of the best indie games of all time, receiving an impressive 83 on Metacritic. GRIS is a moving and emotional release that&rsquo;s comparable to being inside a watercolor painting, and while it won&rsquo;t really challenge the player, it will take them on unforgettably short and sweet journey that&rsquo;s quite unlike anything else.
In our review, Screen Rant said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no spoken dialogue in GRIS. It&rsquo;s just music and visuals but the emotional story it tells about loss with those limited tools is deeply felt. Screenshots do not do GRIS justice and neither does video. The visuals have a magical quality all their own when the player is put in control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22  Chained Echoes (2022)
All Platforms</p>
<p>Chained Echoes</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Steam , macOS , Linux , Nintendo Switch , Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    December 8, 2022     Developer(s)    Matthias Linda     Publisher(s)    Deck13 Spotlight     Genre(s)    RPG</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Chained Echoes surprised and delighted players when it released in December 2022, offering much more than expected in its gameplay, characters, and combat. Taking much of its inspiration from the SNES era, Chained Echoes pays homage to the greats that came before it, but innovates enough to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Featuring turn-based combat that&rsquo;s elevated thanks to its additional strategy elements, Chained Echoes is one game every JRPG fan should play. On Metacritic, the game has a score of 90.
Screen Rant said: &ldquo;For all the aesthetics of games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6, Chained Echoes doesn&rsquo;t feel like a &rsquo;90s game (a trap that many retro-leaning indies fall into). Chained Echoes is a fresh, smart adventure that celebrates classic JRPGs while not being afraid to push into new directions. It&rsquo;s sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking - and always fun. It&rsquo;s a must-play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>21  Lost Judgment (2021)
PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S</p>
<p>Lost Judgment</p>
<p>Franchise    Judgment     Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X     Released    September 24, 2021     Developer(s)    Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio     Publisher(s)    Sega     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Lost Judgment is the sequel to Yakuza spin-off Judgment, and once again follows protagonist Takayuki Yagami at the Yagami Detective Agency. The game&rsquo;s deep and often dark storyline is balanced with its lighter gameplay elements as Yagami infiltrates a high school on his quest for the truth. As players delve deeper into the mystery at hand, the full story unravels in a masterclass of narrative design that will keep players engrossed from start to finish. Lost Judgment has a Metacritic score of 82.
Screen Rant wrote at the time: &ldquo;Lost Judgment is nothing short of stunning. It&rsquo;s tightly-packed narrative never fails to enthrall, while its gameplay systems make navigating to each of its engrossing narrative beats an exciting experience in its own right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20  Dead Cells - Return to Castlevania DLC &amp; The Queen and the Sea DLC (2023)
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mobile</p>
<p>Dead Cells</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , macOS , Linux , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , iOS , Android , Nintendo Switch     Released    August 7, 2018     Developer(s)    Motion Twin , Evil Empire     Publisher(s)    Motion Twin , Playdigious     Genre(s)    Action , Metroidvania , Roguelike</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review (Return to Castlevania)
Regarded as one of the best roguelikes out there, Dead Cells had a lot to live up to with its 2022 The Queen and the Sea and 2023 Return to Castlevania DLC releases. Both are an impressive addition to the main game (and prior DLC), with the former boasting a Metacritic score of 92, and the latter 88. Both feature an exciting array of new weapons, allowing each DLC to bring something new to the core Dead Cells experience.
Screen Rant said of Return to Castlevania: &ldquo;For people who have been playing Dead Cells routinely since launch, Return to Castlevania offers a cathartic experience akin to your favorite author reading you their favorite book. For new players who love games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night but haven&rsquo;t yet tried Dead Cells, there has never been a better time.&rdquo;

<p>19  A Plague Tale: Innocence (2019)

<p>A Plague Tale: Innocence</p>
<p>Franchise    A Plague Tale     Platform(s)    PC , Xbox Series X , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    May 19, 2019     Developer(s)    Asobo Studio     Publisher(s)    Focus Home Interactive     Genre(s)    Horror , Adventure , Action</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Released in 2019, A Plague Tale: Innocence follows the story of brother-and-sister duo Amicia and Hugo in 14th century France. As the name suggests, much of the story and gameplay revolves around the deadly plague sweeping through Europe, with the resulting game being a memorable and emotional experience that doesn&rsquo;t shy away from some elements of horror. Not one for those with a fear of rats,A Plague Tale: Innocence has a Metacritic score of 81.
Screen Rant said: &ldquo;It successfully combines horror, action, survival, combat and story in a way that so few games do in this modern age. A Plague Tale: Innocence is also a reminder that the world still needs single-player story-based games, especially those that are as wonderfully beautiful and heartfelt as this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Platform(s)    macOS , Nintendo Switch , PC , Xbox One     Released    April 18, 2019     Developer(s)    Askiisoft     Publisher(s)    Devolver Digital     Genre(s)    Action , Platformer</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Side-scrolling indie hit Katana ZERO earned critical acclaim when it launched in 2019, with its Metacritic score standing at 83. The game follows a time-bending samurai with the ability to slow down the passage of time for precise and deadly combat maneuvers. This fresh mechanic makes every battle more significant, adding a layer of strategic gameplay as players try to find the best way to overcome even the trickiest of situations.
Screen Rant said: &ldquo;As big-budget games have increasingly embraced bloat and the overstuffing of content, it&rsquo;s refreshing to play a small, tight title brimming with confidence in its style and design. Katana ZERO is just that: a veritable wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17  Metroid Dread (2021)
Nintendo Switch</p>
<p>Metroid Dread</p>
<p>Franchise    Metroid     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    October 8, 2021     Developer(s)    MercurySteam , Nintendo EPD     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action-Adventure , Metroidvania</p>
<p>Read: Screen Rant&rsquo;s Five-Star Review
Metroid Dread surprised fans with its unexpected 2021 announcement, with the game releasing just a few months later. Metroid Prime 4 was - and still is - in development, making the reveal of Dread and its classic 2D gameplay a very welcome release. The title appealed to fans both new and old, earning a very impressive 88 on Metacritic and still remaining one of the must-play games for Nintendo Switch.
In Screen Rant&rsquo;s review, we said: &ldquo;Metroid Dread is an instant classic. Its seamless blend of exploration, combat, puzzle-solving, and light touches of story creates one of the most engaging experiences on Nintendo Switch. Samus Aran&rsquo;s journey has been through its ups and downs, but the mesospheric high of Metroid Dread is evidence there is so, so much more left for the bounty hunter to accomplish, and another adventure can&rsquo;t come soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
