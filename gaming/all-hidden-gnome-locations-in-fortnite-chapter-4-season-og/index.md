## Literature Review

In Fortnite Chapter 4 Season OG, players can collect ten Hidden Gnomes all across the Fortnite island. Each provides Battle Pass XP when collected.





There are a total of ten Hidden Gnomes, and luckily, for anyone aiming to score a Victory Royale, some can be found near Fortnite&#39;s best landing spots. Others can be a little harder to find, as they’ve been placed in hidden or hard-to-reach areas. They don’t appear to be linked to specific quest objectives, so you can collect them in any order you like.

 How To Find All Hidden Gnomes 
          

Hidden Gnomes can be found at the spots marked on the map above. They shouldn’t be too hard to find, as a small exclamation mark icon will appear when you’re close to each one. However, more specific details are available if you’re having trouble finding them. Since Fortnite’s gone back to Chapter 1, you might recognize some familiar landmarks.



 Hidden Gnome #1: Llama Statue Near Junk Junction 
          




Found on the hill north of Junk Junction, at the base of the giant llama statue.

          

This Hidden Gnome is located near a pile of debris and a no-dancing sign.

 Hidden Gnome #2: Camp Near Pleasant Park 
          

Found at a small campsite on a grassy hillside south of Pleasant Park.

          




This Hidden Gnome can be found relaxing by the campfire with a teddy bear. Make sure to collect some items before heading here, as this area can be popular with players.



 Hidden Gnome #3: Hill North Of Greasy Grove 
          

Found on a hillside just northeast of Greasy Grove.

          

This Hidden Gnome can be found near a stone monument with some loot chests surrounding it. It’s resting in a red armchair with three teddy bears nearby.

Found inside the mines at Shifty Shafts.

Found east of Shifty Shafts near a crashed Battle Bus.
