## Literature Review

An Stronghold known as Tur Dulra can be found in Diablo 4, but this area&#39;s enemies can be difficult to clear as you try to cleanse Sanctuary of evil.





The Tur Dulra Stronghold can be found in Scosglen, west of your map toward the coast. Similar to the number of Strongholds in the Fractured Peaks, three of these areas are in this part of Sanctuary. Tur Dulra&#39;s level is determined by what World Tier you&#39;re playing on, indicating the average strength of enemies found and giving you a recommended level to reach with your character.






Once you enter the valley where the Tur Dulra Stronghold is located, you won&#39;t have to fight enemies until you speak to the spirits of the Druidic College at the center of the area.

To complete the Tur Dulra Stronghold in Diablo 4, you have to free the spirits trapped by soul burners in three places, then beat the Baelgemoth Infernal Tormentor boss. Once you talk to the spirits at the center of the Stronghold, the landscape will change from green beauty to infernal flames. Waves of demons will attack in waves until you can reach every soul burner in the former Druidic College.




As you may expect, the trapped souls are guarded by Elite enemies and their demonic minions in large numbers. Destroy the soul burners as you take on these enemies, using your OP character build in Diablo 4 to decimate your foes with brutal efficiency. After each contraption lies in ruins, take the druid souls back to the center of the Stronghold to initiate a final boss fight.

The boss of this Stronghold is Baelgemoth, Infernal Tormentor, a hulking beast wielding a mace covered in flames. Baelgemoth uses fast melee attacks to take out chunks of your character&#39;s health, in addition to large Area of Effect (AoE) strikes when it gets to low health. Keep your distance and land some hits with your best Skills when the boss is recovering from its attacks in Diablo 4.

When you clear the Tur Dulra Stronghold in Diablo 4, you can earn tons of gear as rewards, with a Legendary item or better, usually guaranteed with your loot.
