## Literature Review

Golden Mario is one of the many collectibles in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Players will be able to select this alternate form of Metal Mario before a race.





As mentioned before, Golden Mario is not an extra character but an alternate skin for Metal Mario. This special collectible can be unlocked by challenging the Grand Prix at 200cc. Selecting the highest speed can be challenging for many players, as some courses aren&#39;t designed with carts traveling this fast. Additionally, you must complete each cup and have the highest score overall to claim first place. Along with Golden Mario, players can also unlock other Gold Items in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.






You do not need to obtain Golden Trophies on Boster Courses to unlock Golden Mario.
