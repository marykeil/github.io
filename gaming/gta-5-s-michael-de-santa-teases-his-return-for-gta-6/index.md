## Literature Review

Voice actor Ned Luke seems to be teasing Michael’s return in GTA 6. Here’s what he says, and how the fan favorite character might factor in.




Ned Luke, the voice actor who plays Michael De Santa in Grand Theft Auto 5, has dropped hints that suggest his character will make an appearance in Grand Theft Auto 6. Little is known so far about the next GTA, which is expected to have its first trailer in December 2023. However, leaks and wild rumors about GTA 6 have been mounting for a decade. Very few of them are verifiable, but the few reliable leaks do provide an idea of what to expect. Ned Luke&#39;s response is too cryptic to be called a leak, but as an actor who&#39;s actually worked on the series, he&#39;s certainly a reliable source.




In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Ned Luke replied to a fan&#39;s question about whether Michael would appear in GTA 6 with, &#34;It&#39;s a mystery,&#34; accompanied by five star emojis.


 

To be fair, there&#39;s not a lot to go on here, but the lack of a proper answer is an answer in itself. If, for whatever reason, Luke hadn&#39;t been invited back to reprise his role, it would have been all too easy for him to simply decline and wish the developers of GTA 6 well. This cryptic response, however, suggests that he&#39;s somehow involved.

Ned Luke might not just be playing coy in keeping silent about the potential of a Michael De Santa cameo in GTA 6 - he could be contractually obligated to do so. It&#39;s not uncommon for voice actors to sign non-disclosure agreements, especially when working on such a highly anticipated, unrevealed project as GTA 6. Luke could be subject to a similar contract here, and might not be able to reveal anything about his appearance in GTA 6 until it&#39;s officially announced by Rockstar.

There&#39;s really no reason not to believe Michael could return for GTA 6. Depending on Franklin&#39;s choice in the final mission of GTA 5, Michael may either live or die. Since all three characters survive in the &#34;Deathwish&#34; ending to the final mission, it&#39;s safe to say Michael lives. Plus, during Franklin&#39;s appearance in GTA Online, he heavily implies that after the end of GTA 5&#39;s story, Michael found work as a movie producer. So it wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch for Michael to take a little trip to Vice City (or wherever else GTA 6 is set), at which point he may make a brief appearance.




                  GTA 6 Release Date Leaks &amp; Rumors - Everything Confirmed &amp; Debunked (So Far)   GTA 6 is one of the most hotly-anticipated games in recent memory, but with Rockstar remaining quiet, there&#39;s lots of release date rumors to explore.   

However, given the stress he goes through during the entirety of GTA 5, and his general desire to leave a life of crime behind, it&#39;s not likely that Michael will play a major role in GTA 6. If anything, he&#39;ll probably appear briefly, perhaps begrudgingly granting a side quest or two to keep himself out of trouble. If he&#39;s still working as a movie producer, it wouldn&#39;t be too surprising to see him involved in some kind of stunt driving quest, with players racing through the streets on camera for his latest action flick.

The five stars in Luke&#39;s post could also be a nod to the Wanted system common to all GTA games, in which severity of the player character&#39;s crimes and intensity of the police response is represented by between one and five stars. Could Michael&#39;s cover be blown in GTA 6, forcing him to return to the streets to guarantee his safety?




Whatever the case, a cameo by this much-beloved character would be more than welcome. There&#39;s no word on other characters returning to GTA 6; if Steven Ogg (Trevor) and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) are due to appear, they haven&#39;t said anything about it yet. Since Luke isn&#39;t likely to reveal anything more at this point, and Rockstar might want to keep something like this as a post-release surprise, it&#39;ll be impossible to say for sure until Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s nebulous release date finally arrives.
