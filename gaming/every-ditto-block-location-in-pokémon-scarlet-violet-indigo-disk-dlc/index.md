## Literature Review

The Ditto Block BBQ is one of the most frustrating tasks in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but knowing where to look can save time.





Though not necessary to complete the Indigo Disk DLC, BBQs are the only way to earn a significant amount of BP, aside from battling trainers. Additionally, for those interested in catching the post-game legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC completing a substantial number of Group BBQs will be required specifically.

 What Are Ditto Blocks &amp; How To Find Them 
         

Ditto Blocks are essentially exactly what they sound like Dittos masquerading as blocks. Specifically, the pastel-colored luminescent blocks that make up the various structures throughout the terrarium. The task associated with finding them will appear as a Group BBQ in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. It typically consists of tracking down 3-5 specific Ditto Blocks in one of the four biomes. Unfortunately, the location of the blocks is randomized every time the BBQ is initiated.



Ditto Blocks will always be attached to a structure but typically stand out. For example, when looking at a flat wall, the Ditto Block will typically protrude from the wall, not lined up with it, making it slightly more obvious to spot. 







Additionally, Ditto Blocks are a somewhat different color than normal blocks. Aside from their Ditto face, the Ditto Blocks also appear as a darker shade of purple. To collect them, they must be interacted with, at which point they will turn into a normal Ditto in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.

This means there is no way to look up a specific location for each Ditto Block, nor will they likely be in the same place each time. That being said, structures can typically be seen on the map but are quite small and easy to miss when locating them all.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: How To Find (&amp; Catch) Ditto   Having a Ditto makes breeding Pokémon easier in Scarlet and Violet; however, they can be easily missed in the wild if they aren’t paying attention.   



 All Savannah Biome Ditto Block Locations 
          




The Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Savannah Biome is perhaps the easiest to search when it comes to looking for Ditto Blocks. Primarily because it is mostly a flat area where block structures can be spotted quite easily. Ditto Blocks can appear on any structure in the area, including the Classroom areas, Fly Points, and even during the BB Elite Four stage. So be sure to check everywhere, from the top to the bottom. There are around 25 different structures to search for in this region.



Since these are group BBQs, try to avoid double-searching the same structures. Instead, split the biome between the players in the group and start at opposite ends or corners to cover the ground more quickly.






 All Canyon Biome Ditto Block Locations 
          

Unfortunately, the Canyon Biome, alongside the Coastal Biome, can be the most difficult to search since it includes several elevations and platforms throughout the area. This makes it easier to miss structures, so it&#39;s important to double-check which ones have been searched and keep a list handy to help ensure you check every single one. The Canyon Biome has around 25 structures to check, including the stairs on the sides of the mountains and the various bridges.






Don&#39;t bother checking the Blocks separating the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; VioletIndigo Disk DLC Biomes from each other. These large walls are not a spawn point for the Ditto Blocks, and thus, they will never be there when searching, only on the structures within the actual Biome itself.






 All Polar Biome Ditto Block Locations 
          

Though the Polar Biome is similar to the Canyon Biome in that it has elevations that can make narrowing down a search tricky, the Polar Biome is easier to search for one reason. Most of the elevation in the Polar Biome is ascending a singular mountain and not several different cliffs and canyons. This means that players can start at the top of the mountain and work their way down quite easily, making sure to hit all 30&#43; of the scattered Block Structures. However, with the bright white landscape, the structures can be harder to spot from a distance, so check the map often.​​​​​​​




                  Pokémon Gen 10 Games Should Steal This From Indigo Disk DLC (&amp; It&#39;s Not The Synchro Machine)   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet does something new with its trainers. Here’s what it is, and why it should reappear in Gen 10 games and beyond.   



 All Coastal Biome Ditto Block Locations 
          

Though Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Coastal Biome has the added difficulty of elevation and a cluttered landscape, making it harder to spot the block structures from afar, it also has some benefits. About 50% of this biome is water, where no block structures will be found, drastically decreasing the search area. Secondly, the Coastal Biome has the smallest quantity of block structures to check. So, despite the added difficulties, sectioning off the biome among the group should still be manageable.



 All Central Plaza Ditto Block Locations 
          




On occasion, the BBQ for the group may state that the Ditto Blocks can be found in the Central Plaza, where you can find the Synchro Machine in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Unfortunately, though this is a small area to search, the entire Central Plaza comprises these blocks, meaning the Ditto could be anywhere. The best tips for this are to double-check every corner and crevice of the Central Plaza and potentially look at the sky to get a better bird&#39;s eye view.

Additionally, while they won&#39;t be found along the long walls leading into the Biomes, be sure to check the exterior of the Central Plaza as they may not be found inside the Central Plaza. This means that as long as the wall or pillar is technically part of the Central Plaza, the Ditto Block can be found on it, even if it is on the side that is technically part of one of the four Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet biomes in the Indigo Disk DLC.
