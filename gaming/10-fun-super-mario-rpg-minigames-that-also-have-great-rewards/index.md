## Literature Review

Super Mario RPG’s minigames are some of its most enjoyable aspects, but they can also be very rewarding. Here are the best ones in either category.




Minigames are some of the most enjoyable parts of Super Mario RPG. Sure, the main campaign is fun enough; the delightful enemy designs, fast-paced combat, and evocative music keep it perfectly interesting. But sometimes, players need a break, especially when it&#39;s time to decompress after beating one of Mario RPG&#39;s hardest bosses. That&#39;s where the minigames come in. Each one is original, accessible, and enjoyable, but some definitely stand out from the pack.
All minigames pose a formidable, if satisfying, challenge, but some are more complicated than others. All minigames are fun, but some have more potential for repeat play. And (almost) all minigames come with rewards, but some are more worthwhile than others. The best minigames in Super Mario RPG strike the perfect balance between the three: they&#39;re demanding enough to stay interesting, fun enough to keep players coming back, and rewarding enough to be worth the time they take to master. Whether they&#39;re immensely rewarding, tons of fun, or a little of both, here are some of the highlights.

 10  Goomba Thumping (In The Pipe Vault) 
Rewards: Flower Tab, Flower Jar, Frog Coin
        

Goomba Thumping plays exactly like Whac-A-Mole: enemies of varying colors and species pop out of four equidistant pipes, and Mario must jump on them in sequence in order to rack up points. Golden Goombas are worth more than regular ones, and Spikeys detract points from the total. Rewards vary here, but Mario gets a prize each time he beats his previous high score. The first time, it&#39;s a Flower Tab; the second time, it&#39;s a Flower Jar; and the third time, it&#39;s a Frog Coin.
In Super Mario RPG, Frog Coins are tradable for a variety of items that can be used in battle for different buffs and bonuses. There are two shops that accept Frog Coins: one at Tadpole Pond, and another in Seaside Town. 






 9  Memory Cards (At Grate Guy&#39;s Casino) 
Rewards: Healing Items


 







Grate Guy&#39;s Casino is a sort of minigame mansion, home to a handful of different side activities of varying complexity. Once players unlock Grate Guy&#39;s Casino, they can return whenever they need a brief distraction from the main story. The best, however, is the Memory Card game. In one of many changes made to Mario RPG&#39;s Switch remake, Memory Card replaces Blackjack, but it&#39;s still just as fun. In order to win, players must match pairs of identical cards from a deck of ten. For getting a few pairs right, players get a random high-tier healing item: a Cleansing Juice, Party Cleanse, Royal Syrup, Maple Syrup, or Finless Cola.





 8  Mine Cart Racing (Inside Moleville Mountain) 
Rewards: Coins


 







After Mario and friends escape from Moleville Mountain in a mine cart, they can return to go racing on rails yet again. The goal here is simply to stay on course and pick up mushrooms as the tracks twist and turn. Players can bet 30 coins that they&#39;ll beat Mario&#39;s previous record time. Betting 30 nets the player 50 coins if they win. Since the track is always the same and can be memorized, players can quickly rack up a series of best times as they master the ideal course. If they bet the full 30 coins each time, they&#39;ll almost double whatever they put in.





 7  Melody Bay (At Tadpole Pond) 
Rewards: Healing Items
        

At Tadpole Bay, the curled composer Toadofsky is looking for music to move him. As he goes along his travels, Mario will learn three different songs from NPCs throughout the world, which he can then reconstruct using the tadpoles as notes and the lines in their pond as staves. The tadpoles&#39; song is sweet, but the rewards are even sweeter. Each time Mario successfully arranges a song, Toadofsky will reward him with a card he can turn in at the nearby Juice Bar. These unlock new, powerful healing items, which Mario can buy at will. The best one is Finless Cola, which restores 150 HP to all allies at once.





 6  Battle Course (Part Of The Six-Door Chamber In Bowser&#39;s Keep) 
Rewards: Drill Claw, Star Gun
        

Bowser&#39;s Keep provides a series of challenges for Mario to overcome, and one of those is the Battle Course. This is a straightforward enemy gauntlet: Mario faces two rounds, each split between three different rooms with four battles occurring in each one. The battles get increasingly difficult, but there&#39;s a nice prize at the end. For beating round one, players get the Drill Claw weapon for Bowser, and for round two, the Star Gun for Geno.

 5  Action Course (Part Of The Six-Door Chamber In Bowser&#39;s Keep) 
Rewards: Sonic Cymbals, Super Slap
        

Like the Battle Course, the Action Course is also located within Bowser&#39;s Keep. But instead of fighting, this time, Mario is charged with a series of platforming challenges. Platforming sections are usually pretty brief in Super Mario RPG, but here they take center stage. Mario must negotiate moving blocks, rotating balls, half-visible mazes, and rolling barrels as he proceeds to the finish lines of six different courses. For round one, the reward is a pair of Sonic Cymbals for Mallow, and for round two, the Super Slap for Peach.





 4  Paratroopa Cliff (At Land&#39;s End) 
Rewards: Trooper Pin, Frog Coins
        

Paratroopa Cliff provides another platforming challenge: Mario must jump from Paratroopa shell to Paratroopa shell as he makes his way up a cliff. The shells move in all directions, requiring patience and careful timing. But of course, this challenge is timed, and the rewards depend on how long Mario takes to complete it. The first time he gets to the top in under 12 seconds, Mario gets a Troopa Pin, an accessory that multiplies the wearer&#39;s physical and magic damage by one and a half. If he does it again in under 11.49 seconds, he gets a Frog Coin; under 11 seconds flat, and he gets five Frog Coins.





 3  Mushroom Derby (On Yo&#39;ster Isle) 
Rewards: Yoshi Cookie
        

The Mushroom Derby is a good old-fashioned Yoshi race, taking place on their home turf of Yo&#39;ster Isle. In practice, it plays like a rhythm game: players must mash A and B to a specific beat in order to keep Yoshi&#39;s speed up. Each time he wins, Mario will get a Yoshi Cookie, which can either be used to give Yoshi a speed boost, or to summon him in battle. Once summoned, Yoshi will attempt to eat an enemy, leaving behind a random item in their place. This can be incredibly useful for removing troublesome enemies, but Mario and company won&#39;t get any XP from monsters Yoshi eats.





 2  Midas River Run (Along The Midas River) 
Rewards: Frog Coins


 







Midas River is the first minigame unlocked in Super Mario RPG, becoming available immediately after finishing Kero Sewers. It&#39;s a two-parter: in part one, Mario is washed away by a branching waterfall, with a limited ability to choose which path he takes. He can pick up coins or duck into shortcuts along the way. Once he reaches the bottom, Mario jumps on top of a barrel, and an auto-scrolling section begins. At a series of pivotal points, Mario can choose to stay the course or change his trajectory, but one side always has more coins than the other.
Like the mine cart race, there&#39;s an ideal path here, so this minigame can be mastered. Mario saves up whatever coins he gathers, and once he hits a certain threshold, he can trade them in for a Frog Coin. This can be used to rack up tons of Frog Coins very quickly, allowing players to afford powerful items before a tough battle.





 1  Beetle Race (On Booster Hill) 
Rewards: Coins, Frog Coins
        

This is an adapted, replayable version of the Booster chase scene that first takes place when Mario arrives at Booster Hill. Once he&#39;s visited Beetles Are Us, Mario can purchase a Beetle Box to unlock this minigame, which involves running up a dirt hill, avoiding barrels, and collecting beetles. Female beetles are each worth one coin (but they can add up), male beetles are each worth 50 coins, and gold beetles are each worth a single Frog Coin. Grinding this minigame is the perfect way to save up either kind of currency. It&#39;s also just a ton of frantic fun.
Many of Mario RPG&#39;s minigames are easy to learn, yet hard to master. Whether players try them and move on or grind them out until they&#39;ve perfected them, they&#39;re all still worth a shot. Even if they&#39;re not that interesting or have lackluster rewards, every single one of Super Mario RPG&#39;s minigames is worth checking out at least once.
