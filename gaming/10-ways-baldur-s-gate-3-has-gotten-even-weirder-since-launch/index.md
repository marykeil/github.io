## Literature Review

The Forgotten Realms can be a silly place in Baldur’s Gate 3. Here are 10 ways it’s only gotten weirder in the many patches since launch.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 was always a bit off-kilter, but it&#39;s only gotten weirder since launch. While each patch aims to fix some of the game&#39;s bugs, oversights, and oddities (and often succeeds), each one also adds to the myriad of player options available in the game. And Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players have gone out of their way to prove that they&#39;re deeply, deeply weird.
Whether it&#39;s licking a dead spider, walking around the Lower City in the nude, or stuffing Shadowheart into a box and calling it a &#34;speedrunning strategy,&#34; BG3 indulges its players&#39; strangest fantasies in the greatest way. As weird as it let things get in its earliest, pre-launch form, it&#39;s only gotten progressively weirder with each subsequent update. Here are some changes made across all five patches to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3to make the Forgotten Realms more bizarre than ever before.
            
 
 You Can Now Become A Level 30 God In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has some basic limits in place that make all of the game&#39;s systems work in harmony, but limits are sometimes meant to be broken.












 








 10  Bing Bong The Imp Is Now Canon 
A High Rollers Reference Made It Into BG3
        

In a BG3-themed special, the live-play Dungeons &amp; Dragons podcast High Rollers featured the voice actors for all the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Origin characters playing their characters in a round of tabletop DnD. In one now-iconic moment, Jennifer English, who plays Shadowheart, befriends a stray imp named Bing Bong, much to Lae&#39;zel&#39;s dismay. Bing Bong has since become a fan favorite character, and Larian evidently heard the clamor. Patch 5 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 makes Bing Bong canon, with Shadowheart acknowledging his existence in a late-game line of dialogue.





 9  Ceremorphosis Got Grosser 
A BG3 Patch Amps Up The Body Horror
        

As they explore the Nautiloid during the tutorial of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players may happen upon a poor NPC trapped inside a transformative pod. If they interact with a nearby node, the pod will fill with smoke as the poor prisoner pounds on the glass, and when it clears, they&#39;ll be transformed into a Mind Flayer. It was an unpleasant enough image at launch, but since the release of Patch 3, the transformation is more graphic than ever before. The scene is still mercifully brief, but tentacles can be seen sprouting from the prisoner&#39;s mouth as their eyes begin to glow and their joints twist unnaturally.





 8  Players Are Encouraged To Kill Party Members BG3 
A Patch Made It Much Easier To Throw Companions Off A Cliff


 







Well, that&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration, but one BG3 patch did make it much easier to kill party members in outlandish ways, only to resurrect them immediately after. At launch, putting companions&#39; bodies in boxes and throwing them into a chasm resulted in their being eliminated entirely from the roster. They couldn&#39;t be resurrected in any way, not even by talking to Withers. However, Patch 2 did away with that feature, allowing even characters who die in this oddly complicated manner to be resurrected at camp. It&#39;s a great way for a flightier Tav to get the ultimate, if temporary, revenge on a party member who mildly crossed them.





 7  BG3&#39;s Boo Is Now Immortal 
Minsc&#39;s Miniature Giant Space Hamster Got A Major Buff In Patch 5


 







Minsc is one of the most interesting characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, a recurring series icon who gives even the weirdest player characters a run for their eccentric money. Minsc is accompanied everywhere by Boo, a &#34;miniature giant space hamster&#34; whom he hurls into combat. When thrown at an enemy, Boo does a bit of damage and may temporarily blind them - but in earlier iterations of the game, he took a bit of damage himself, too. Patch 5 makes Boo impervious to throwing damage, ensuring that Minsc may continue tossing him to his heart&#39;s delight.





 6  BG3 Lets Tav Immortalize Their Nude Form 
Stoney And Boney&#39;s Statue Can Create An Interesting Legacy
        

When the party visits the Circus of the Last Days in Act Three, it&#39;s possible for Tav to commission a statue of themselves from Stoney and Boney. What the game doesn&#39;t tell you, though, is that the two sculptors will carve Tav&#39;s likeness in whatever clothes they currently happen to be wearing: their favorite armor, their camp clothes, or indeed, absolutely nothing at all. Each option is full of personality: does Tav want their eternal likeness to evoke fear, friendliness, or lust? This feature wasn&#39;t available at launch, either, and has only been an option since Patch 4.





 5  BG3 Lets Party Members Get Stinky 
...And Then Clean Themselves With Stray Bars Of Soap
        

Players may try not to think about it, but the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 party probably doesn&#39;t smell very good. They&#39;re constantly covered in blood, muck, and slime, sleep inches from a campfire every night, and tote thousands of stacks of cheese, raw fish, and haggis. And they&#39;re rarely, if ever, seen showering - until Patch 4, that is. Patch 4 made soap, a common item found throughout the world of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, fully functional. It can now be used to clean blemishes off player characters&#39; faces, and, according to the patch notes, to remove &#34;bad odors&#34; - which, until the integration of Smell-O-Vision, players themselves are thankfully immune to.





 4  BG3&#39;s Emperor Has More Discerning Tastes 
The Emperor Will Only Eat Certain Brains
        

Throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the party will encounter a Mind Flayer with mysterious motives, a complicated figure who styles himself The Emperor. All Mind Flayers in BG3 have an action called Extract Brain, a deadly attack that can deal up to 101 damage and heal the Mind Flayer for up to 36 points.
The one saving grace of this move is that it&#39;s not always effective: the target must be either stunned or unconscious for the Mind Flayer to extract their brain. However, in previous patches, The Emperor was hungrier than usual, and would target even prone characters for attempted lobotomization. Since that was patched out, however, he&#39;s become a bit of a gourmand, and will only try Extract Brain on suitable targets.





 3  BG3 Companions May Experience Spontaneous Resurrection 
Withers Brings Everyone Back To Life For The Finale


 







The ending of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is intense, culminating in an enormous battle for the fate of the Forgotten Realms and a series of emotional epilogues that tie up BG3&#39;s loose ends. The final fight is tough, and it&#39;s not uncommon for characters to die during it. Since the game immediately transitions into the closing cutscenes afterward, this could have devastating results: if a player&#39;s favorite companion died to the final boss, they&#39;d miss out on the epilogues involving them unless they loaded a save. Thankfully, Patch 5 fixes this: now, if a companion dies in the final battle, they&#39;ll be resurrected just in time to savor the aftermath.





 2  BG3&#39;s Patch 5 Adds Improved Corpse Physics 
        

But don&#39;t think that just because a character dies in BG3, they&#39;re completely useless. Dead bodies can come in handy, whether it involves casting speak with dead to learn their secrets, carting them around to raise instant allies, or using one of the most broken secrets in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to defeat bosses without even touching them. As a matter of fact, players picked up cadavers so frequently that Larian patched in special animations to make those actions look more realistic. It may be a weird example, but it goes to show how much more fun a game can be when developers pay attention to their fans.





 1  BG3 Patched In Jiggle Physics Without Telling Anyone 
&#34;Did It Always Move Like That?&#34;
        

Larian made thousands of changes with the fifth major post-launch update to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, with a list of patch notes so long that most didn&#39;t even make it halfway down. But even if they did, nothing could prepare them for the biggest surprise of Patch 5: Larian added jiggle physics for player characters&#39; privates. Whether they just took a quick peek or their party&#39;s been a traveling nudist colony since Act One (no judgment), many a player was shocked to find that their characters&#39; extremities suddenly waggled in the breeze after installing Patch 5. Even so far along after launch, BG3 still has the potential to surprise.
If they continue along the current trajectory, the Forgotten Realms will only get weirder in future updates to BG3. It&#39;s shudder-worthy to consider how weird things could get in DLC. As strange, gross, and shocking as it can be, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 at its best is pure, bizarre fun - and as players and developers both get more creative, it&#39;ll only improve.
