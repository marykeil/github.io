## Literature Review

With the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, you can now catch Gen 5 Black &amp; White Starter Pokémon after completing some club requests.





When you arrive at Blueberry Academy at the start of the Indigo Disk DLC, you&#39;ll see that the area is split into four biomes. As you progress through the main story, you&#39;ll unlock a feature called the Support Board, where the League Club helps the other clubs and students at the Academy. The Teranium Club has three requests through the Support Board that will unlock the Gen 5 Black &amp; White Starter Pokémon.






The Starter Pokémon are scattered across four biomes in Blueberry Academy; the Canyon Biome, Coastal Biome, Savannah Biome, and Polar Biome. Each generation is split between three of the four biomes.





 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Snivy 
          

Snivy is the Grass-type Starter Pokémon from Generation 5 and a fun inclusion for your Indigo Disk teams. It won&#39;t spawn until you complete the Savannah Biome biodiversity request from the Teranium Club via the Support Board.

This request costs 3,000 BP (Blueberry Points) to unlock extra Pokémon within the biome, but since this request spawns alongside Starter Pokémon from Generations 2 and beyond, it is a worthwhile purchase. Once you complete this request, you can find Snivy wandering the Savannah Biome.






 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Tepig 
          

If you want to catch Tepig, the Gen 5 Fire-type Starter, you&#39;ll need to spend 3,000 BP on another Teranium Club request. This request focuses on boosting the biodiversity of the Canyon Biome. The Canyon Biome is the only location where you can catch Tepig anywhere in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Tepig is usually found in the southeast portion of the biome.

                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 3 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   Starter Pokémon have arrived with the Indigo Disk DLC, including the Treeko, Torchic, and Mudkip from the Gen 3 Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald games.   



 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Oshawott 
          




Oshawott is a Water-type Pokémon that can only be found in Blueberry Academy&#39;s Polar Biome, playing in the snow and chilly waters. Like the Savannah and Canyon Biomes before, you&#39;ll need to collect 3,000 BP from quests to complete a Teranium Club request regarding the biodiversity of the Polar Biome. Upon paying 3,000 BP, you can go catch Oshawott somewhere in the biome&#39;s northern waters.

Once you have Oshawott, you&#39;ll officially have all the Gen 5 Starter Pokémon available in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.
