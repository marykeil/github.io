## Literature Review

The final Wordle word of 2023 is ready to be solved. Here are the daily hints, and fully spoiled answer, to the December 31st Wordle.





If a more difficult challenge is more your speed there are several excellent Wordle copycats that increase the difficulty by adding extra challenges on top of the basic game structure. Quordle is a very popular game that has players trying to solve four different Wordle puzzles at the exact same time, sharing answers and hints between them. If the daily Wordle is too easy one day it&#39;s a great place to go to get in a bit more of a challenge.

Before we spoil today&#39;s Wordle answer we wanted to provide a few hints to help out anyone who may be struggling a bit.

 Hint 1  There are no repeating letters.   Hint 2  The answer is used as an adjective.   Hint 3  This word uses the &#34;sometimes&#34; vowel.   Hint 4  In video game slang this word is used to describe someone who is very bitter and acting out.

The December 31st Wordle answer is SALTY.

The final word of the year and we finished it in record time with an incredibly lucky second guess. For our starting Wordle word we used our all-time favorite starter, IRATE. This provided a correctly placed &#39;T&#39; and a single vowel, &#39;A&#39;, in the wrong position.

Our second guess only took a few seconds to come up with, we wanted to move the &#39;A&#39; around and originally thought PLATE, but that would place the &#39;A&#39; in the exact position it was in the first guess. We started to type PALTE by error and our brains instantly saw the ALT and scored our Wordle win-in-two with the correct answer, SALTY.
