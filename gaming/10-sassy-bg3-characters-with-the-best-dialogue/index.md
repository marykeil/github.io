## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 can be tragic, but its characters can turn it into a laugh riot. Here are some of the biggest personalities with the best lines.




There&#39;s plenty of sass to be had in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Its characters always have something to say, and more often than not, that something is a cheeky one-liner or a snide snipe. Whether they&#39;re putting down an omnipotent boss, critiquing one of Tav&#39;s decisions, or simply making a flippant remark, almost every character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a potentially smart mouth - the only difference is how often they choose to open it.
But naturally, some characters are far ruder (and far funnier about it) than others. For some, their sassy side only shows when Tav makes certain poor decisions in BG3. For others, it&#39;s as good as a core part of their personality. Whether they&#39;re known for a few one-off gags or their every line is dripping with sarcasm, here are some of the cheekiest characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

 10  Withers 
The Sassy Skeleton
        

It&#39;s hard to think of Withers as a sassy character, but he&#39;s more than capable of dishing it out. Withers is mostly responsible for running a small, mobile shop that follows the party around from camp to camp. He can also help with hirelings, or let the party respec in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. However, from time to time, Withers will comment on Tav&#39;s progress when they speak with him. If they haven&#39;t romanced anyone, Withers may indirectly insult them by asking too many questions about their love life. It may seem innocent enough, but his deadpan, &#34;And thus, you are alone&#34; has the faintest sting of cruelty about it.





 9  Shadowheart 
Sassier In Early Access


 







Shadowheart takes herself a bit too seriously at times, but she does have a bit of a mean streak, and a wicked sense of humor to match. If Tav picks her favorite flower, a Night Orchid, while they&#39;re traveling through the Underdark, Shadowheart first tries to convince them that the blossoms are highly poisonous, and that death is imminent, before relenting and offering a curt word of thanks. Apparently, Shadowheart had a wider range of snappy comebacks in the early access version of the game, many of which were cut in the full release. But she&#39;s still got plenty of cheek, especially in dealing with githyanki.





 8  Lae&#39;zel 
Ghaik-Hater Extraordinaire
        

Lae&#39;zel and Shadowheart are two sides of the same coin, each believing they&#39;re on a divine mission that leaves them little time for jokes and jabs. The operative word being &#34;little&#34; - Lae&#39;zel still makes time to hurl insults at those she perceives as foolish, ignorant, or beneath her. Sometimes, she doesn&#39;t even have to speak to cut deeply. A mere roll of the eyes, which Lae&#39;zel performs frequently and dramatically whenever Tav sasses back, can be just as devastating as a string of githyanki curse words. Lae&#39;zel reserves a certain animosity towards Shadowheart and Illithids, but eventually takes pity on her cleric companion and begins to sympathize with her.





 7  Barcus Wroot 
The Consternated Comic
        

Players first meet Barcus Wroot in the Blighted Village, where a gang of goblin bullies have tied him to a windmill and left him spinning. He&#39;s a bit too distressed to do much more than cry out, but as soon as the party stops the windmill, he cops an attitude. Barcus has bigger fish to fry, wanting to free his fellow gnomes forced into servitude by True Soul Nere. He scorns any attempt by Tav to interrupt his efforts, and scolds his hard-headed friend Wulbren for failing to heed his advice. If Tav invites him to take a drink, he&#39;ll brush it off rudely.





 6  Mizora 
Devilishly Funny
        

Mizora is Wyll&#39;s patron, which means he&#39;s bound to her, first by oath and later by filial piety. As a result, Mizora sees Wyll as inextricably indentured to her, taking every opportunity available to belittle him. It doesn&#39;t stop there, either. Mizora scoffs at any and all humanoids, but reserves a special disdain for Karlach as an escapee from Zariel&#39;s army. She wields her omnipresence for evil, withholding crucial information from characters when they most need it, and airing past hurts to reopen their wounds. And she does every bit of it with a gleeful smirk on her face.





 5  Mol 
The Tiefling Thief
        

Mol perfectly embodies the archetype of the unrepentant crook, a tiefling child who lies, steals, and scams to guarantee her and her friends&#39; continued comfort as they live the life of nomads. Mol may be a skilled pickpocket with a cache full of loot swiped from her fellow refugees, but she refuses to apologize for it. If Tav tries to scold her, she&#39;ll mock their bleeding heart. But if they want to invest in her eventual Thieves&#39; Guild, she&#39;ll jump at the chance. She claims to care for her fellow tiefling kids, and she may well do so, but in the end, Mol&#39;s only looking out for herself.

 4  Lucretious 
The Rowdy Ringmaster
        

Lucretious is the ringmaster at the Circus of the Last Days, a traveling troupe of unearthly delights the party can avail themselves of when they first arrive in the suburb of Rivington. If the party&#39;s already engaged in the fight against Dribbles the Clown, she opens with a killer one-liner: &#34;Oh dear. Screaming children, an oozing corpse - and it&#39;s not even my birthday.&#34; It only gets better from there: Lucretious is quick-witted, dramatic, and playfully mocking of her closest friends. And if they help her find the missing Dribbles, she gives the party the powerful Spellmight Gloves.
Does that voice sound familiar? Lucretious is voiced by drag queen Vinegar Strokes, who appeared in series one of RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race UK. 






 3  Raphael 
The Cutting Cambion


 







Like Mizora, Raphael is a devil, which means cruelty&#39;s in his very blood. He delights in it similarly, but where Mizora&#39;s slings of choice are reductive pet names, Raphael prefers insulting metaphors and sly personal slights. He constantly reaffirms how badly the party needs him, reminding them of the grotesqueries of ceremorphosis and their relative weakness in the face of danger. And he only gets sassier should players choose not to side with Raphael in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in stopping their Illithid transformations. Raphael half-threatens, &#34;I have a feeling you&#39;ll change your mind. Before it&#39;s changed for you.&#34;





 2  Harvard Willoughby 
Roastmaster General
        

Dare they enter the Elfsong Tavern and comedy club in the Lower City, the party will be challenged to a battle of wits called the Laff Riot. This is headed by comedian Harvard Willoughby, a pun professional who opens his set with the bombshell, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be here tonight, except my wife ran off with a cambion. That&#39;s right, I got fiend zoned.&#34; If Tav decides to insult him in turn, Willoughby playfully critiques their jokes for being too old. If they successfully work the crowd, he resolves to steal their material. Willoughby may make sass his very business, but he pales in comparison to one other character.

 1  Astarion 
The Sass Master


 







Astarion is the very picture of sass, the physical embodiment of a sneer. He seems to delight in outright verbal cruelty; it&#39;s basically a prerequisite for romancing Astarion in BG3. It&#39;s even worse if he has to turn Tav down; if they aren&#39;t close enough to him when they suggest spending a night together, he asks, &#34;Can you imagine?&#34; and groans before turning even paler than usual. Astarion is easily the sassiest character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, not only because he has a line for everyone, but because they cut so deeply, too. His posh accent and wavering pitch only add to the fun.
These may be some of the sassiest characters in BG3, but depending on how they&#39;re played, Tav can easily surpass all of them. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is truly a comedy, full of silly jokes, snide asides, and mountains upon mountains of cheek. The Forgotten Realms can be a treacherous place, full of great risk and uncertainty. But with some of these Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 characters by Tav&#39;s side, it can also be a pretty good laugh.
