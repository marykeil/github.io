# Why Everybody Hates Silent Hill Ascension


## SUMMARY 



  Silent Hill: Ascension falls short in its attempt to revive the series, lacking the depth and mystique of the classic Silent Hill titles.   The interactive element of Ascension, where viewers can vote on the story&#39;s path, is marred by a voting system that favors those willing to spend money.   While Ascension was a disappointment, there is still hope for the series with the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, which can learn from Ascension&#39;s mistakes and deliver a true revival.

## Literature Review

Silent Hill: Ascension was meant to start the series’ revival, but instead, it ended up receiving criticism. So, what went wrong with Ascension?




Silent Hill: Ascension has released its first episode, but it hasn&#39;t kicked off the series&#39; attempt at a revival positively. Since the cancelation of Silent Hills, the series has been in an uncertain state, but the announcement of several new games and a remake of Silent Hill 2 sparked hope for a revitalization. Unfortunately, Silent Hill: Ascension had multiple flaws preventing it from living up to its potential.




[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Silent Hill: Ascension.]

Silent Hill: Ascension&#39;s design is a blend of a television series and a Choose Your Own Adventure style of game, similar to Netflix&#39;s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. Genvid, which describes itself as a massively interactive entertainment company, took up the task of creating Ascension, putting the pressure of being the ones to start the return of Silent Hill. The gameplay elements are reminiscent of those used in The Quarry and its predecessor, Until Dawn, where choices determine how the story plays out. However, instead of a single person making choices, Ascension allows the full community watching it at that time to vote to decide which path the story takes.

                  Every New Silent Hill Game Coming In 2023 &amp; Beyond   Konami has announced several new Silent Hill video game projects that will likely launch in 2023 and beyond, signaling the dormant series&#39; revival.   


 Where Silent Hill: Ascension Fits In The Series 
          




Silent Hill: Ascension follows six core characters, but they aren&#39;t all located in the same city. Instead, they&#39;re set in two locations that are half a world away, but they end up connected through a series of deaths and mysteries. With the creepy town, cultist elements, and the presence of monsters, Ascension hits a lot of the features that are expected from Silent Hill games. There are also references to other games in the series, such as the dying wife of a character that calls back to James Sunderland&#39;s situation in Silent Hill 2. However, similarities and references aren&#39;t enough to make Ascension the beginning of a revival that the series needed.



 Ascension Lacks The Depth Of Classic Silent Hill 
         

Ascension makes plenty of references to the classic Silent Hill titles, namely the original trilogy. Cults were a large part of Silent Hill 1 and 3, and the foggy town and nightmare version of the world are staples seen across the series. Unlike the games before it, however, Ascension isn&#39;t subtle about the psychological elements that the nightmare world and its monsters tend to symbolize. Characters will outright say that the monsters are a manifestation of things like judgment, or the visions that a character has will say that they appear as punishment for that character&#39;s past actions.




This style of storytelling takes away the mystique that the uncertainty of Silent Hill&#39;s nightmare world often contains. It also limits the ability to craft theories about the content because a lot of it is simply explained. When combined, these features make Ascension feel more superficial than its predecessors in the series, and with the faster pace and upfront explanations, it&#39;s harder for the game to build up the tension and fear that anticipation can bring.



 Ascension&#39;s Interactive Element 
          

As an interactive streaming series, Silent Hill: Ascension&#39;s method of interacting with its viewers is a core element. The idea of having a whole community deciding on the canon events for a Silent Hill game has a lot of merit and potential on its own, and it could&#39;ve resulted in a unique experience, similar to Twitch Plays Pokémon, which inspired Ascension&#39;s style. However, the implementation of the interactions quickly became a main point of criticism of Ascension.




                  Silent Hill: True Story &amp; Real Town&#39;s History Explained   The Silent Hill franchise, both the movies and the games, focus on the titular town of Silent Hill. Here&#39;s the true story of Silent Hill explained.   

Specifically, the voting system is designed in a way that not every vote has equal weight. This is done through the inclusion and use of both the Battle Pass - which costs $20 and comes with customization options - as well as microtransactions. When it comes time to vote in each episode, which is generally around the last 30 seconds for the most important choices, viewers can add points to their votes. Points are purchased with real money, and that means the votes are decided by the person who&#39;s willing to spend the most money on their choice.

As such, viewers without money to throw at Ascension can end up feeling scorned at the unfairness of this monetary system and the way it minimizes the power of their opinion. In these situations, the biggest contribution that viewers who don&#39;t wish to spend money on Ascension can make to the story is through participating in the chase sequences and combat portions where the community works together to help the character survive or dooms them to be killed by the monster. But considering the number of people working together on those sequences, it might not feel like enough to make up for the voting system.






 Why Silent Hill: Ascension Was Important For The Series 
          

Konami put Silent Hill: Ascension at the beginning of what was supposed to be the resurrection of the series, and that ended up sparking hope in a community that had been disappointed repeatedly in the past years, especially with the cancelation of Silent Hills and Kojima&#39;s exit from the company. And the result was a game that wasn&#39;t completely a game, but certainly contained the microtransactions of one while missing the soul of the series that once rivaled Resident Evil. However, a glance at the reviews and ratings of Ascension shows that it just ended up being another disappointment added to the list.

And yet, Ascension might&#39;ve helped Silent Hill 2&#39;s remake, which is the game that had the most concern over how faithful it would be in recreating a fan-favorite title. Bloober Team showed an understanding of what works in psychological horror in its game The Medium, and that experience can help the SH2 remake succeed where Ascension failed. And Bloober Team won&#39;t need to disable chat due to a lacking profanity filter like Ascension had to, although the chat went back up after adjustments were made.




In the end, Ascension felt detached from what made the early games in the Silent Hill series special and memorable. Instead, it included a story that&#39;s mediocre at best with occasionally clunky animations, and an in-game economy that&#39;s a cash grab at best, and predatory at worst. However, it might not be time to write off the series&#39; revival, as the star of the resurrection, Silent Hill 2&#39;s remake, has a chance to make up for the shortcomings of Silent Hill: Ascension.



Silent Hill: Ascension is available on ascension.com or the Silent Hill: Ascension mobile app for iOS and Android.
