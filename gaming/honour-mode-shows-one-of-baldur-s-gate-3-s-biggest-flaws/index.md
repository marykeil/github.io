# Honour Mode Shows One Of Baldur s Gate 3 s Biggest Flaws


## SUMMARY 



  Honour Mode in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers a unique challenge with a single save slot, eliminating save-scumming.   The single-save nature of Honour Mode adds tension and forces players to live with their decisions and failures.   However, the single-save nature can also make running into bugs and glitches more frustrating and potentially waste hours of progress.

## Literature Review

Honour Mode offers some of the most challenging content in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but also manages to expose one of the game&#39;s biggest shortcomings.




Although Honour Mode in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers a unique challenge, the heightened difficulty also comes along with a single save slot, which can put much more focus on one of the game&#39;s biggest shortcomings. Added in the game&#39;s fifth major patch, Honour Mode is a difficulty setting that goes beyond even the previous hardest mode, Tactician, buffing enemy stats, changing their tactics, and giving bosses unique Legendary Actions to make them even more challenging. Along with the added in-game difficulty, though, Honour Mode also comes with the caveat of only allowing a single save, effectively eliminating save-scumming from the equation.




While the single-save nature of Honour runs can be contentious, to the point that some Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players would rather avoid it, the lack of opportunity to save-scum does add an interesting dimension to Honour Mode playthroughs. Unlike in normal difficulties, where poor decisions or poor rolls can be walked back, Honour Mode forces players to try and play through their failures, potentially putting them in situations that they might never have encountered in normal play, and adding a unique sense of tension to every decision and roll. Unfortunately, however, the single-save nature of Honour Mode can also exacerbate one of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s biggest flaws.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Still Has A Lot Of Bugs 
         




Like almost any other game of its scale and complexity, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 still has its fair share of bugs, even after several patches to fix the game&#39;s most notable problems. In normal playthroughs, encountering a bug can be a minor annoyance, even if it ends up wiping the entire party or changing the direction of the story - players can simply reload a save and not have to deal with the results of whatever glitch they may have encountered. An unintended consequence of Honour Mode&#39;s single save, however, is that it makes running into bugs and glitches much more frustrating.

Part of Honour Mode&#39;s challenge is to force players to consistently weigh the risks of certain decisions - wrong dialogue choices, failed rolls, and risky moves in combat can&#39;t be walked back by reloading a save, so each choice and action has to be carefully considered. This added tension is the result of the single save, but Honour Mode also makes running into bugs especially frustrating - instead of losing because of any wrong decision that the player made, the run may be ended by an unintended and sometimes unforeseeable mistake on the part of the game. In runs that get especially far, this can end up essentially wasting many tens of hours of progress.




                  Everything Added In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Patch 5 Update - New Modes, Boss Changes, &amp; Differences   Patch 5 adds some of the biggest changes to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 yet, expanding an already robust experience with new modes, a new epilogue, and more.   



 How Glitches Can Ruin A BG3 Honour Run 
          

Compounding the issue, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 tends to have more bugs pop up in later portions of the game - whereas Act 1 is mostly solid, being the most thoroughly tested portion of the game through its lengthy Early Access period on Steam, a variety of bugs and glitches can start to crop up in Act 2 and 3. For example, moving surfaces like certain elevators or floating platforms, which are intended to carry the party to specific destinations, will sometimes move without bringing the party along, or otherwise simply disappear - if the entire party was on the platform, this would end up dropping everyone into a death pit, ending the run immediately.




Other bugs might not end in TPK, but can still be frustrating to encounter in an Honour run - rarely, the game may fail to display the correct dialogue options, showing only &#34;Continue,&#34; preventing players from getting to choose their responses. At other times, skipping through the dice rolling animation may fail to add any bonuses to the final result, which can cause a player to fail on a roll that they should have succeeded on. Quests may not resolve correctly, decisions might not have their intended outcomes, and interactions in combat might not go as they should.



In the case of bugs that block progression but don&#39;t actively end the run, simply exiting the playthrough and loading the Honour Mode save again may fix the issue.




While Honour Mode does allow players to continue after a failed run, changing the playthrough to a Custom Mode run with the same rules and modifiers, losing Honour Mode due to bugs is a frustrating experience - especially for players aiming to get every achievement or snag the cosmetic golden dice reward. There are plenty of factors that intentionally make Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Honour Mode harder, and to deal with those factors relatively correctly, only to lose hours of progress due to a bug or glitch, undercuts the challenge that the mode is supposed to represent.






 How To Stop Bugs From Ruining An Honour Run In BG3 
          

On the bright side, there are still ways to mitigate the effects of bugs on Honour Mode runs. Knowing about the most significant bugs in advance can help players to potentially avoid losing a run to them - for example, when dealing with elevators, it&#39;s possible to leave one or two party members on solid ground, preventing a TPK if the elevator bugs out, and allowing the party to rejoin safely if there&#39;s a waypoint on other side.

The most foolproof method, though, would be to simply back up Honour Mode playthroughs by making a copy of the save file. While this could technically be considered cheating the mode&#39;s intended single-save challenge, having a backup in the case of run-ending bugs or glitches can prevent a lot of frustration. For players with the discipline to only load their backup save in the event of a game-breaking bug, keeping a copy of their Honour Mode save on hand will provide some welcome insurance against unintended glitches and interactions.




It&#39;s important to note that experiencing bugs and glitches can vary from person to person - although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is certainly on the buggier side of games, many players may go through their entire time with the game without noticing any significant issues. As Larian continues to patch BG3, fixing (or, unfortunately, potentially adding) bugs, it&#39;s likely that the most frustrating, potentially run-ending bugs will be fixed, making Honour Mode a smoother experience - or, at least, an experience that&#39;s rough for the correct reasons. For now, though, Honour Mode highlights and exacerbates one of the biggest flaws still present in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
