## Literature Review

Finding the location of a Doghouse in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies can give you or all the members of your squad a Hellhound companion for future fights.





There are 16 different Doghouse locations in Urzikstan where this structure could spawn, randomly determined when you or your squad deploy. Similar to every Schematic unlocked in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, it will take a bit of luck to find one of these in an area with a lower threat level. However, an icon on your map will appear as you get close to a Doghouse that has appeared in Urzikstan.




                  Modern Warfare 3 Zombies: How to Find (&amp; Craft) Perk-a-Cola   There are nine different Perk-a-Cola items to find and craft in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, giving you a wide variety of buffs against undead hordes.

The location of every possible Doghouse spawn was discovered by Reddit user r/funkymunkey66661 and is displayed in the image above. Most of these places will be outside the center of Urzikstan and, thankfully, away from the most dangerous spots on the map. The best way to make the Doghouse icon appear on your map is to explore the perimeter of the medium threat zone in Modern Warfare 3.


 




Once you find the Doghouse, you will see that the top of its entrance says &#34;Feed Me,&#34; implying that you need to give something to the Hellhound inside before it can become your friend. This refers to the Chunk of Meat item found as loot from exploded zombies. You can enforce this drop from enemies using grenades, rocket launchers, or Ammo Mods in Modern Warfare 3, like Shatter Blast.

Return to the Doghouse when you collect a Chunk of Meat, insert the item into the structure, and wait for a few moments. A friendly Hellhound will emerge, ready to defeat the hordes of undead around Urzikstan with you or your squad in Modern Warfare 3. This creature is an AI-controlled companion that you can pet with a button prompt as you approach the animal during the peaceful moments of your deployment.

Knowing all the possible Doghouse locations in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies will ensure that you always have this fiery canine at your beck and call to help complete various missions.
