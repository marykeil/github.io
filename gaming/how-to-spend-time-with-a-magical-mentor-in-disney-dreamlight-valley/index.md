## Literature Review

One of the new Star Paths in Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s recent update asks you to spend time with a Magical Mentor, who you may already recognize.





Star Paths asks you to perform certain duties tied to that job, giving you missions your character may pursue for a number of Tokens. Spending time with a Magical Mentor is one of the first goals tied to the Royal Winter Star Path included in the update. Thankfully, you don&#39;t have to unlock any new faces in your Valley, like Jack Skellington or Gaston in Disney Dreamlight Valley, to accomplish this objective.

 How To Find a Magical Mentor In Disney Dreamlight Valley 
          

The best Magical Mentor in Disney Dreamlight Valley is Merlin, a familiar figure you interact with early in the game. Once you accept the quest tied to the Royal Winter Star Path, simply interact with Merlin, then select the &#34;let&#39;s hang out!&#34; option. Stay with Merlin for 15 minutes since this will fulfill the objective requirements whether you do anything with the character.



One of the best things to do while waiting for the 15 minutes with Merlin to expire is to gather resources from within the new maps introduced in the A Rift in Time expansion.







If you want to maximize your time spent with Merlin, assign the character a role to help you with other tasks. Merlin could use the powers of the arcane to help unlock Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley or help you track down other characters to recruit. Complete as many quests as possible with Merlin at your side while you wait for the 15-minute timer to run out.

Once you finish the small mission, you&#39;ll have taken another step in the Royal Winter Star Path, which leads to many different rewards. Special winter skins for specific characters are only one of the things you can earn after spending time with a Magical Mentor in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
