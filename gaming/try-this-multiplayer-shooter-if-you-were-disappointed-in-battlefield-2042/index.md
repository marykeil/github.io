# Try This Multiplayer Shooter If You Were Disappointed In Battlefield 2042


## SUMMARY 



  The Finals, developed by veteran Battlefield developers at Embark Studios, offers familiar gameplay mechanics that resemble the classic Battlefield experience, but with a unique twist.   The game emphasizes squad-based tactics and coordination, making it a potential substitute for Battlefield 2042, which has been criticized for its reliance on Specialist characters and lack of squad organization.   The Finals stands out with its impressive server-side destruction feature, which adds an innovative and ever-present dimension to matches and firefights, and has been a long-standing request from Battlefield fans.

## Literature Review

Battlefield 2042 is in a respectable state after two years of post-launch support, but a completely different game might offer the same kind of fun.




While Battlefield 2042 has certainly come a long way since its troubled launch over two years ago, it&#39;s still not quite the quintessential Battlefield experience many series fans were hoping for. The Finals, however, might be the perfect fit for players disappointed in 2042. Embark Studios&#39; debut release is quite different on the surface, and its game modes aren&#39;t the large-scale conflicts Battlefield is known for, but much of the new game feels strikingly familiar, albeit with a refreshingly unique coat of paint. The Finals doesn&#39;t necessarily encroach on Battlefield&#39;s specific niche, but its creators, design, and innovations all have surprising parallels.




High hopes for Battlefield 2042 were dashed when the game launched with a vast array of bugs, but even DICE getting the game to be technically serviceable wasn&#39;t enough to overcome some fundamental pitfalls in its design, some of which have been alleviated by the return of classes. 2042&#39;s reliance on Specialist characters still chiefly alienates it from Battlefield&#39;s hallmark experience, however. The more recent release of The Finals has fallen on the opposite end of the spectrum – comparatively few bugs haven&#39;t stopped the fledgling playerbase from diving into what is, despite its high-octane trappings, primarily a game reliant on squad-based tactics.

                  &#34;Gets Your Blood Pumping&#34;: The Finals Preview   Fast-paced FPS action and eye-catching visual effects make The Finals one of the best free-to-play arena shooters out there right now.    


 The Finals Is Made By Veteran Battlefield Developers 
          




A development studio consists of much more than its most senior staff, so the entire team&#39;s involvement can&#39;t be discounted, but Embark Studios&#39; founders have illuminating collective experience. The Embark Studios website&#39;s About page lists six &#34;industry veterans&#34; who founded the company and now serve its C-suite positions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Embark founders Magnus Nordin, Rob Runesson, Stefan Strandberg, Patrick Söderlund, Jenny Huldschiner, and Johan Andersson were all previously employed by EA Digital Illusions CE AB, aka DICE, in prominent positions. A non-exhaustive summary of their influence on the Battlefield series includes technical, art, creative, and communication direction, technology and systems development, executive roles, and much more.

Interestingly, Embark was founded in November 2018, the same month Battlefield V launched. BFV had its own problems, and it&#39;s likely impossible to prove a correlation, but this exodus from DICE and the founding of Embark in late 2018 is at least notable. Embark would actually go on to announce a different game before The Finals. Arc Raiders was revealed at The Game Awards in 2021, roughly eight months before The Finals&#39; teaser trailer. Arc Raiders has since morphed from PvE co-op shooter to PvPvE extraction shooter mid-development, according to the game&#39;s executive producer, Aleksander Grøndal (via Medium), and it was apparently internal playtests that convinced Embark to focus on releasing The Finals first.






 The Finals Almost Feels Like A Polished Battlefield Game 
         

It wasn&#39;t just a smooth launch that helped The Finals get a strong start out of the gate – its polished gameplay can result in a good first impression, and a number of mechanics feel familiar enough to their Battlefield analogs that it makes the learning curve a little less steep. While certain piecemeal elements help The Finals feel familiar (e.g. how defibrillators work, weapons having a tactile verisimilitude, etc.), there&#39;s a heavy focus on squad-based design that helps it become a potential substitute for Battlefield 2042. In 2042&#39;s current state, Specialists and gadgets are categorized into classes, but the wide range of special abilities still erodes the necessity for the squad organization Battlefield built its reputation on.




The Finals has comparatively small team sizes – matches typically involve two, three, or four teams of three players – but coordination is practically required to see any sort of success, especially in the Tournament playlists where a limited number of individual respawns creates more competitive interest. The balance isn&#39;t perfect yet, and some classes feel more versatile than others (The Finals&#39; Heavy class has a lot of disparate build options), but the same interplay between offensive, defensive, and utility abilities that makes classic Battlefield interesting has a large presence in The Finals strategy. While The Finals&#39; gameplay at large flows quite differently, its main Cashout game mode is also reminiscent of the thrills created by attacking and defending M-COM stations in Battlefield&#39;s Rush game mode, which was best utilized in Bad Company 2.



The Finals&#39; Tournament and Ranked Tournament playlists are locked until the requisite number of rounds have been played.







                  Best Light Build For The Finals (Weapons, Specializations &amp; Gadgets)   The Light class is the fastest option in The Finals. A good build can sneak in, kill several targets, and get out without being attacked back.   



 The Finals Has The Destruction You&#39;ve Always Wanted In Battlefield 
          

Bad Company 2 is also significant in the Battlefield canon for its pervasive environmental destruction, something 2042 has been criticized for lacking. There are gameplay considerations to account for when allowing every building on a Battlefield map to be leveled – with 64 or more players (Bad Company 2 had a max player count of 32 on PC), a fully destructible map will quickly lose all viable cover. It&#39;s understandable that Battlefield hasn&#39;t really iterated on its destruction, but it&#39;s still one of the series&#39; most requested features. For those disappointed in 2042&#39;s lack of environmental reactivity, The Finals makes it a cornerstone of its design.




Practically everything except for the ground can be wrecked in The Finals, and the impressive implementation of this as a server-side feature ensures a collapsing wall won&#39;t cause an erroneous sync issue that puts players at an unfair disadvantage. With moveable objectives and vertical map design, destruction becomes an important and ever-present dimension to every match and firefight. Embark Studios&#39; website has a noticeable focus on using new technologies to advance the medium, and The Finals&#39; destruction at times feels like it&#39;s truly innovative.

Battlefield 2042 is perfectly serviceable, and even a compelling shooter in its current state, but it unfortunately feels like a regression for the beloved series. Although clearly not a direct successor to Battlefield, The Finals feels as though its foundation was inherited to some degree. It won&#39;t satisfy the exact same desire for widespread vehicle and infantry combat like Battlefield 2042, but The Finals still offers a distillation of the same kind of squad-based tactics, with the added bonus of truly novel ideas delivering a fresh gameplay loop.
