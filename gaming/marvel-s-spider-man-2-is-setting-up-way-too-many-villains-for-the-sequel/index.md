# Marvel s Spider-Man 2 Is Setting Up Way Too Many Villains For The Sequel


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 may struggle to do justice to each villain&#39;s arc due to the studio&#39;s desire for shorter game lengths, which would match a complaint seen in previous Spider-Man movies.   Green Goblin and Doc Ock are set to be the main villains in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3, with Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius both seeking revenge.   Carnage&#39;s transformation is inevitable, as Cletus Kasady escaped with a symbiote in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, setting up his return in a potential story DLC or Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3.   Chameleon&#39;s loose end needs to be tied up, and other villains could potentially return as well. Cindy Moon&#39;s introduction as Silk may bring her own set of villains.

## Literature Review

Could Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 have the same problems as Sony&#39;s Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movies due to juggling too many villains?




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has set up a lot of villains for its sequel. While it may be exciting to see what Insomniac Games has in store for some of Marvel&#39;s most iconic villains, there is some concern that the studio may not be able to do justice to each character&#39;s arc, especially as it has spoken out about not wanting to do overly long games when discussing Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s length. This seems to be a common complaint surrounding some of Sony&#39;s Spider-Man movies, with both 2007&#39;s Spider-Man 3 and 2014&#39;s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 criticized for juggling multiple villains without giving a satisfactory amount of screen time to each villain&#39;s arc.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2]

The first Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man game did manage to balance the entire Sinister Six, alongside additional villains such as Tombstone and Shocker, so it&#39;s possible that Insomniac could pull it off. The majority of the team - Vulture, Electro, Rhino, and Scorpion - wasn&#39;t fleshed out, however, and appeared as boss battles while the main story&#39;s focus remained on Mr. Negative and Doc Ock. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 may not have that luxury, as the rest of the series has built up several villains who will each likely require their own larger storylines.

 : Marvel’s Spider-Man 2: Every Villain Confirmed &amp; Teased So Far


 Green Goblin And Doc Ock Seem To Be Spider-Man 3&#39;s Main Villains 
Otto Octavius Is Planning &#34;The Final Chapter&#34;
         

It&#39;s clear that the main villains in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 will be Green Goblin and Doc Ock, with Norman Osborn&#39;s villainous turn seeming inevitable after Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s conclusion. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 made Norman Osborn far more sympathetic than he was in the first game, showing him more as a desperate father than a calculating politician and businessman as he goes to great lengths to save his son, Harry, from a terminal disease and pleads with the Spider-Men to save Harry from the Venom symbiote, rather than killing him to destroy it.






Osborn&#39;s villainous alter-ego, Green Goblin has been teased since the first Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man game, which showed several prototypes of the Goblin&#39;s costume and weapons.




Sadly, Harry had bonded too much with the symbiote, so the only way to defeat the alien threat was to kill the host. In a moment of clarity, Harry gives Peter his blessing to do so, but his death is short-lived as Miles resuscitates him with his bioelectric powers soon after the symbiotes&#39; defeat. Unfortunately, the damage is done and Harry is rendered brain-dead, leaving Norman distraught and vengeful, blaming the Spider-Men for &#34;ruining&#34; his son. While sitting beside a comatose Harry&#39;s bedside, Norman tells one of his scientists to prepare the &#34;G-Serum&#34;, which is very likely Insomniac&#39;s version of the Goblin Formula from other media. Although the implication is that this could be another way to treat Harry, it&#39;s possible that Norman could use it on himself to exact his revenge as the Goblin.




Otto Octavius&#39; return is also heavily set up in the game&#39;s post-credits when Norman visits his former colleague turned rival at the R.A.F.T. supermax prison to seek the identity of the Spider-Men, planning to attack them personally, or target those they love in a typical Green Goblin tactic. Otto doesn&#39;t assist Norman with his plans for revenge, coldly telling him &#34;We all have to experience loss. Even you.&#34; However, he clearly has his own ideas regarding what to do with the Spider-Men, writing what he menacingly calls &#34;the final chapter&#34;. It&#39;s worth noting that Otto&#39;s writing with a shaking hand, showing further deterioration of his body since the first game, which could indicate that he is plotting a Superior Spider-Man-esque plan as a solution to his degenerative neurological disease, which would certainly result in the end of one of the Spider-Men, albeit for a short while.

The Superior Spider-Man comics saw a dying Otto Octavius place his consciousness in Peter Parker&#39;s body and take over the role of Spider-Man to prove that he could be better at crime fighting. While many believed this killed Peter Parker initially, this only lasted a brief time, as Norman Osborn nearly took control of the city, and kidnapped someone Otto loved, Anna Maria. Otto realized that he couldn&#39;t beat Norman so he went into his mind and let Peter regain control and erase Otto, giving Peter full control of his body once again. With both Norman and Otto returning, it&#39;s possible that Insomniac could adapt some form of this storyline in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3.






In Spider-Man: Life Story, due to the real-time aging of Peter Parker since he became Spider-Man in the 60s, Otto planned to take control of the younger Miles Morales in the &#34;2010s&#34; chapter instead.




 : How Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Sets Up Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3&#39;s Story &amp; Villains



 Cletus Kasady&#39;s Transformation Into Carnage Is Inevitable 
Casady Escaped With A Symbiote In Spider-Man 2
          

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;The Flame&#34; side missions saw Peter Parker joining forces with Yuri Watanabe&#39;s vigilante alter-ego Wraith to investigate a sadistic cult terrorizing New York City. At the end of this arc, the cult&#39;s leader is revealed to be Cletus Kasady, who Spider-Man fans will know better as the ultraviolent symbiotic villain, Carnage. Carnage is clearly set up as Kasady escapes with one of Oscorp&#39;s symbiotes at the end of this arc, announcing that &#34;there will be carnage&#34;, and his &#34;prophecy&#34; involves a ritual to become a red monster as part of an event called &#34;Crimson Dawn.&#34;




It&#39;s likely that Carnage&#39;s return will take place in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s potential story DLC, which would tie up the Insomniac Marvel Universe&#39;s symbiote arc with a slightly longer story than side missions in a main game. As such DLC hasn&#39;t been announced yet, there is the possibility that Carnage could return in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3, potentially ultimately bringing about the return of the horrifying Monster Ock from the 2000 Spider-Man game, considering Doc Ock&#39;s inevitable role.



The final level of Spider-Man (2000) saw the Carnage symbiote bond with Otto Octavius to create Monster Ock.




 : 10 Things A Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC Must Include



 Chameleon Is Still On The Loose 
The Master Of Disguise Doesn&#39;t Have A Clear Storyline Though
          




Kraven&#39;s half-brother, Dmitri Smerdyakov is revealed at the end of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;Unidentified Targets&#34; side activities after the Spider-Men discover his base of operations. Bizarrely, there was no further mention of the character later in the game, so this is likely setting up his return in DLC or the game&#39;s sequel instead. With Kraven&#39;s death in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, and the brothers&#39; clearly strained relationship making it unlikely that he&#39;ll seek revenge, there is seemingly no clear storyline for Chameleon going forward, but the character roaming the streets of New York is still a loose end that should be tied up.

It&#39;s possible that Norman Osborn could hire Chameleon as part of his scheme to destroy the Spider-Men by attacking their alter-egos. This could involve posing as their loved ones or even as the Spider-Men themselves to disgrace them in the eyes of the public. Alternatively, Insomniac could take inspiration from the acclaimed but short-lived Spectacular Spider-Man animated TV series. In this show, Norman hired Chameleon to pose as Norman Osborn to remove any suspicion as Norman conducted his villainous schemes as Green Goblin.






 Other Spider-Man Villains Could Return 
         

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 saw the deaths of many classic villains both on-screen and off, and others such as Mr. Negative, Mysterio, Sandman, and Tombstone are fully reformed by the game&#39;s conclusion. However, there are still several other criminals roaming free in the city. Taskmaster was teased on Kraven&#39;s map of potential targets in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but wasn&#39;t mentioned or shown further in the game, and Kingpin was last seen running operations from within the R.A.F.T. in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales​​​​​, so his return is also a possibility. There&#39;s also the potential for Rhino to return, as Insomniac seemingly cut a reference to his death in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, rendering it non-canon.

While not a full villain, Black Cat seemed to get a happy ending in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, escaping from Kraven&#39;s hunters to join her girlfriend in Paris, but there&#39;s still the possibility she could return. Mary Jane kept reminding Miles that Black Cat is a liar, and players saw her lies and manipulation firsthand in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s The City That Never Sleeps DLC, so it&#39;s possible that her story about escaping to be with her lover could be a ruse.




Paris is known for its culture, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine what such a skilled cat burglar could do in a location like the Louvre. The character didn&#39;t appear for long in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, so another brief cameo for a couple of missions could be a possibility, although it would probably be for the best if Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s send-off for Felicia stuck considering how many other characters will already be fighting for screen time.



 Silk&#39;s Arrival Could Introduce Even More Villains 
Cindy Moon Has Her Own Enemies
          

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s post-credits scene introduces Cindy Moon, who is a fellow Spider-person called Silk in the comics. Depending on how Insomniac handles her origin story, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 could introduce Silk&#39;s own villains such as Ezekiel Sims, who locked the character up in the comics upon her getting her spider-powers. Hopefully, considering how much story there is to tell, Silk will have her own game similar to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales to establish her origin in the Insomniac Marvel Universe, rather than cramming it into an already packed Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 campaign.
