## Literature Review

Here&#39;s how to unlock Virizion’s encounter in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and its exact location in the region of Paldea.





Like all returning Legendaries in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, Virizion’s encounter must be unlocked by progressing through the story and gaining access to a special NPC called Snacksworth. This character is located near the entrance of Blueberry Academy, where you first arrive at the sister school to Naranja and Uva Academies from Paldea. After some progress and exploration through the Terarium, you may obtain the Key Item that is necessary to finally encounter Virizion in Scarlet and Violet.




                  How To Catch All Legendary Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC   There are 25 wild Legendary Pokémon available for catching in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but each one must be unlocked with an item.   


 How To Unlock Virizion Encounter In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: Indigo Disk DLC 
          

To unlock the encounter with Virizion, you will need to have a Key Item called Virizion Treat. This item can be obtained from the NPC Snacksworth. Upon completing one group Blueberry Quest (BBQ) in Pokémon Scarlet or 10 solo Blueberry Quests in Pokémon Violet, there is a chance of getting a Virizion Treat as a reward from Snacksworth. The NPC does not follow a specific order, so he may give out the treats for other Legendaries before gifting you the Virizion Treat.



If you do not get a Virizion Treat from Snacksworth, you will have to continue catching Legendaries and completing the necessary Blueberry Quests, depending on your version of the game, until he hands you the Key Item.









 Virizion’s Location In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: Indigo Disk DLC 
          

Once you have the Virizion Treat in the Key Items pouch in your bag, you may proceed to locate it. Snacksworth will give you a tip on where it can be found, but it is easier to locate the Legendary Pokémon if you already know exactly where it is. Virizion’s location in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is in the Tagtree Thicket, a forest area in the East Province. To be even more specific, Virizion will be close to a mountain wall at the northeastern portion of Tagtree Thicket.



Once you find Virizion, you should save your game. This will allow you to hard reset the game if you run out of Poké Balls or accidentally defeat the Legendary creature.




By interacting with Virizion, you will start the encounter. The Gen 5 Legendary’s typing weakens it against Poison-, Fire-, Psychic-, Ice-, Fairy-, and Flying-type moves. If your team is high-leveled and well-trained, you should be wary of using super-effective moves, as these can knock Virizion out with a single hit. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Virizion is resistant to Ground-, Rock-, Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-type moves if you’d rather play it safe and slowly deplete its HP to a satisfactory level.




                  Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests   In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.   

After Virizion’s HP is in the red, you can start showering it with Poké Balls of your preference. You can also try a Quick Ball at the start of the encounter or a Timer Ball if the battle has been going on for several rounds. Virizion is not particularly hard to catch, as long as you have adequately unlocked its encounter and prepared a resilient team to sustain damage if you do not intend on using a Master Ball on it in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
