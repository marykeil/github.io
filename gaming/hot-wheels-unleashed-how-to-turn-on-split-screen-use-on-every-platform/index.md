## Literature Review

In a world where online multiplayer is the norm for video games, it&#39;s great to be able to use split screen in Hot Wheels Unleashed for any platform.





It&#39;s important to note that Player 2 cannot unlock achievements in Split-Screen mode, but they have access to the same content available to Player 1. For example, if Player 1 has every secret car in Hot Wheels Unleashed, then Player 2 can use those vehicles as well. The couch co-op for this game operates off separate controller inputs for Xbox or PlayStation, with JoyCons or a controller for Switch users.






For those used to a controller, it can be more difficult to win races in Hot Wheels Unleashed with a keyboard and mouse. Player 2 can activate a controller on a PC just by connecting it to the system and confirming the input device when Player 2&#39;s menu appears!




                  Hot Wheels Unleashed: All City Rumble Secrets (&amp; How To Unlock Them)   There are nine secrets to unlock in Hot Wheels Unleashed City Rumble. These secrets have to be completed in order to progress throughout the campaign.   


 How to Activate and Play Hot Wheels Unleashed Split-Screen Mode 
          

To activate Split-Screen in Hot Wheels Unleashed, you need to go to the &#34;Quick Modes&#34; menu and set up which devices connect to certain players. Turning on Split-Screen gives you the option to pair a controller or other device with Player 1 and Player 2&#39;s inputs. If you happen to be on a PC, a controller set up for Player 1 will automatically default the mouse and keyboard controls to Player 2.






If Player 2 wants to have a different livery equipped in Hot Wheels Unleashed&#39;s local multiplayer, Player 1 should equip the livery on the quick match loading screen. This saves the livery for the vehicle and allows Player 2 to choose that vehicle with the livery already equipped!




Those looking to win races in Hot Wheels Unleashed have a chance to enter their preferred keys after they set up each player for Split-Screen. The settings for a match are determined by Player 1&#39;s preferences in the same way as the roster of cars available. As seen by YouTube creator Rubhen925, there are some key visual differences for this mode that could be affected by the host&#39;s settings.


 

No Coins or Gears are earned for Player 1 by playing with a friend in couch co-op multiplayer. Split-screen does seem to retain the individual placement of both players&#39; cars, but there seem to be no group placements during this mode. Those who turn on Split-Screen on every type of platform will still be able to see their own lap times as they enjoy a race on a local system in Hot Wheels Unleashed.
