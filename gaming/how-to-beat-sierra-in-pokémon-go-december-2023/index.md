## Literature Review

To beat Sierra in Pokémon GO in December 2023, you will be required to form a powerful team. Here are the best counters for Sierra this month.





Although it is not too often, leaders of Team GO Rocket occasionally change their lineup, which requires Trainers to adapt accordingly. The strategy to beating Sierra in November 2023 has now changed slightly, as she altered one of the possible Pokémon in her lineup. Although the change is not too drastic, it does impact how you prepare your team to counter her. Luckily, Sierra swapped out a Pokémon that was relatively challenging to counter for one that is much easier.

 Best Counters For Sierra In Pokémon GO (December 2023) 
          

As registered by Bulbapedia, there was a slight change in Sierra’s lineup in Pokémon GO. The change occurred on November 14, which ultimately impacted her lineup in December – or, at least, a portion of the month. Most of her Pokémon picks, however, remain unchanged. If you are intent on obtaining a high-ranking Shadow Sableye or a Shiny Shadow Sableye, you can still try to beat Sierra and capture the creature.



Sableye is still her first pick in her lineup and, until the next definitive change, this will always be her first Pokémon. Sableye’s only weakness is Fairy-type, so a powerful Togekiss or Sylveon are the best counters.







Sierra’s second Pokémon can be one of three possible options. In December, the Team GO Rocket leader may use Skarmory, Muk, or Gardevoir. To beat the Steel- and Flying-type creature, you will need to use an Electric- or Fire-type counter. Muk is weak against Ground- and Psychic-type attacks, while Gardevoir is weak against Ghost-, Poison- and Steel-type attacks.

The issue with Sierra’s second pick in Pokémon GO for now is that there is no overlap in weaknesses across her creatures. As such, you will need to prepare a Pokémon to counter one of them, at the risk of her choosing another.



If Sierra ends up choosing a Pokémon that has a weakness that is different than that of the creature you choose to counter her, you may have to challenge her again.




The change in Sierra’s lineup occurred in her third slot, where she took out Kingdra and replaced it with a Victreebel. This is good since Victreebel has a lot more weaknesses – Flying-, Fire-, Psychic-, and Ice-type moves are strong against it. The other two possible Pokémon for her third slot remain unchanged: Gyarados and Houndoom. The table below lists all of Sierra’s possible picks in Pokémon GO during December 2023, as well as their weaknesses and suggested counters:




 Sierra&#39;s Pokémon &amp; Types  Weaknesses  Best Counters   1 - Sableye (Dark- and Ghost-type)    Fairy       Togekiss   Sylveon   Gardevoir   Xerneas      2A - Skarmory (Steel- and Flying-type)    Electric   Fire       Chandelure   Raikou   Zapdos   Entei   Charizard      2B - Muk (Poison-type)    Ground   Psychic       Rhyperior   Groudon   Garchomp   Metagross   Mamoswine      2C - Gardevoir (Psychic- and Fairy-type)    Ghost   Poison   Steel       Chandelure   Metagross   Gengar   Muk      3A - Victreebel (Grass- and Poison-type)    Flying   Fire   Psychic   Ice       Rayquaza   Mewtwo   Alakazam   Charizard   Blaziken   Kyurem      3B - Gyarados (Water- and Flying-type)    Electric   Rock       Raikou   Zapdos   Xurkitree   Electivire   Magnezone      3C - Houndoom (Dark- and Fire-type)    Fighting   Ground   Rock   Water       Machamp   Lucario   Garchomp   Swampert   Kyogre   Blaziken   Tyranitar      



Because some of Sierra’s slot Pokémons’ weaknesses overlap with her second picks’ weaknesses, you may want to use a party composed of a Fairy-type, an Electric-type, and a Ground-type Pokémon. This should give you a lot of coverage, though you may be required to adapt your strategy depending on her picks.

Though there is an off-chance that you may have to face her more than once, beating Sierra in Pokémon GO in December 2023 is not much of a challenge in comparison to a few of her previous lineups.
