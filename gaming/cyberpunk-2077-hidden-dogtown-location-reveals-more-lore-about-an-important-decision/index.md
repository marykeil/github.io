## Literature Review

A tiny, hidden area in Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty provides a wealth of backstory on an important quest character. Here’s how to find it.




A secret area in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC reveals much of the backstory behind a previous mission. Phantom Liberty adds a whole new region to Cyberpunk&#39;s map, being set entirely in a previously unexplored region of Night City called Dogtown. It&#39;s a former vacation playground for the ultrarich that was taken over by the private militia BARGHEST and its tyrannical leader Alex Hansen. It&#39;s the one part of Night City where government agencies have no sway, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s any less corruption. Compared to Cyberpunk&#39;s map, Phantom Liberty&#39;s looks pretty small - but it&#39;s extremely condensed, and there are many things to do in Dogtown.




For one thing, there are tons of secrets to find in Cyberpunk&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC. While many of them reference other media (especially other games developed by CD Projekt Red), there are also plenty of Easter eggs that tie into Cyberpunk 2077 quests. Many of them are hard to find, catering only to the most curious class of player. But once they are found, these secrets really do color in the wider world of Night City. One particularly interesting secret sheds some light on an important quest decision players may have made earlier in the DLC.

                  Cyberpunk 2077’s Night City Is Way Older Than You Think   Night City was founded in the early 1990s, but that was not the moniker its founder and original citizens had in mind to call the metropolis.   


 Phantom Liberty Easter Egg Reveals More About Leon Rinder 
More Backstory For &#34;The Man Who Killed Jason Foreman&#34;
         




As revealed in a YouTube video by Handsome Tez, it&#39;s possible to learn more about NPC Leon Rinder, who features in the quest &#34;The Man Who Killed Jason Foreman,&#34; by finding his secret hideout in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Dogtown. This is a complicated job unlocked during the Phantom Liberty DLC. Despite being short and deceptively simple, there are many different character motivations, interactions, and complications at play in this job. It involves exacting revenge on the murderer of one Jason Foreman, a man named Leon Rinder - but things get far more complicated from there.


 

By exploring an area near Akebono, climbing a set of metal stairs, and jumping across a shipping container, V can find the small, secluded area in Dogtown where Leon Rinder made his home. The general location may be seen in Handsome Tez&#39;s video, or in the map screenshot in the image gallery above. Exploring his little lair, which only contains a laptop and a few sparse pieces of furniture, can help reveal a little more about this complicated character. And depending on what the player chose during the initial quest, it can take on a wholly different tone.






 &#34;The Man Who Killed Jason Foreman&#34; Was A Complicated Job Already 
          

&#34;The Man Who Killed Jason Foreman&#34; begins when V is contacted by Mr. Hands. They’ve been hired by a woman named Briana to exact revenge on Jason Foreman’s murderer. Foreman was apparently a pillar of the community, but since Rinder is a member of the ruling BARGHEST militia, there&#39;s little likelihood of an official punishment. However, Briana knows he’s responsible, describing him as a cold-blooded killer who’d just as soon kill again if he got the chance. She gives V some data Jason had on him when he died, and asks for Rinder&#39;s dog tags as proof of the finished job.

                  10 Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty Choices That Matter Most   Not every choice in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty matters, but many of them do have major consequences. Here’s what to watch out for.   




V must decrypt Foreman&#39;s data shard before tracking down Rinder. Eventually, they locate him in the rear of an abandoned, BARGHEST-infested motel. They&#39;ll have to get through the other BARGHEST troops one way or another to meet with Rinder - who, at first glance, appears to be a well-spoken, well-adjusted individual. If V confronts him about the people he&#39;s killed, he doesn&#39;t seem to remember. He came to Night City in hopes of making it as a fixer. His past isn&#39;t completely uncheckered, but he swears he doesn&#39;t kill indiscriminately.

Johnny Silverhand materializes to give his two cents. Rinder has a lot of exclusive high-tech Cyberware installed, and is experiencing a phenomenon called cyberpsychosis. He was effectively a different person when he killed Jason Foreman, and genuinely doesn&#39;t remember any of it. Now, it&#39;s up to V to become the ultimate arbiter of his fate. They can choose to kill Rinder, spare him, or, if they&#39;ve chosen certain dialogue options throughout the conversation, to convince him he&#39;s experiencing cyberpsychosis and needs medical help.






In order to convince Rinder to seek help, V should show sympathy for him whenever possible, but refuse to make a deal with him when he offers.




Of course, if V kills Rinder, they&#39;ll succeed in the job, but may lose out on some extra loot. If V spares Rinder, he&#39;ll give them his dog tags so that they can convince Briana the job was done properly. They&#39;ll be able to do so without problems, so there are no negative consequences for doing so. Rinder will disappear, leaving V the code to a garage where he keeps a stash, including some of Phantom Liberty&#39;s finest weapons. If they convince him to get help, he&#39;ll do much the same, but still won&#39;t provide his garage code.

                  Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 Update Proves V Is Practically Immune To Cyberpsychosis   Cyberpunk 2077 is getting a massive overhaul with the upcoming 2.0 update, but a change to how Cyberware works suggests V is immune to Cyberpsychosis.   




In the end, it&#39;s a complicated decision. Rinder has undeniably done wrong, but clearly wasn&#39;t aware of what he was doing. Letting him go untreated is dangerous, but killing him outright is cruel. Helping him get treatment is the best outcome, but it&#39;s not available to everyone; it&#39;s easy to miss if V chooses to approach the situation less delicately. And with the insight provided by Rinder&#39;s hideout, it only gets more complicated.



 


 How The Phantom Liberty Secret Changes Rinder And Foreman&#39;s Story 
          

Rinder&#39;s hideout is sparse, but it does contain a laptop with a few files on it. For the most part, they reveal who Rinder was before the cyberpsychosis set in: a slightly cocky, somewhat shady, but ultimately harmless entrepreneur. There&#39;s also a document that mentions offhand the code for his garage, so players who couldn&#39;t get into it during the course of the normal quest can still claim the loot inside.




Depending on the outcome of the quest, Rinder&#39;s hideout takes on a hopeful tone. If V killed him, it&#39;s tragic. It&#39;s a reminder of his wasted potential, and the needless perpetuation of a cycle of violence in Dogtown. If they spared him, however, it&#39;s hopeful. With the right help, Rinder might get back to that same place, and eventually achieve his goals of becoming a wealthy fixer.

Ultimately, this little detail speaks to the level of care put into Cyberpunk&#39;s worldbuilding. It takes a minor character whom many players may have totally missed or killed outright, and completely turns his story on its head with a few minor details. It may not be found by every player in Cyberpunk 2077, but no matter how their time with Leon Rinder ended, his hideout is worth looking for.
