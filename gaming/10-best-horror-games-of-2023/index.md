 25 Best Horror Games To Play Right Now 
From demonic entities to sadistic killers, there&#39;s so much to choose from for horror game fans. Here are 25 of the best horror titles available.












 








 Amnesia: The Bunker Is An Atmospheric Masterpiece 
On PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, And Xbox Series X/S
        

  Amnesia: The Bunker  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    May 23, 2023     Developer(s)    Frictional Games     Publisher(s)    Frictional Games    


Amnesia is the first name in indie horror, and its 2023 installment, Amnesia: The Bunker lives up to its legacy. Set in a claustrophobia-inducing World War I base, Amnesia: The Bunker stars Henri Clément, a French soldier facing a threat his training could never have prepared him for. As Henri clambers toward the surface of a collapsing tunnel, he&#39;s pursued by a deadly monster who hears and reacts to his every move. In classic Amnesia fashion, he also struggles to put incredibly limited resources to the best use. Its creepy atmosphere and tense gameplay earned Amnesia: The Bunker a four-star review from Screen Rant.





 Dead Island 2 Is The Long-Awaited Sequel To A Horror Classic 
On PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, And Xbox Series X/S
        

  Dead Island 2  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Microsoft Windows , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    April 28, 2023     Developer(s)    Dambuster Studios     Publisher(s)    Deep Silver     Genre(s)    First-Person Shooter , Action RPG    


The original Dead Island, released in 2011, was incredibly of its time. That&#39;s high praise. Offering gleeful, zombie-massacring fun in a classically 2010s way, the series went silent after its first installment, apart from a series of genre-bending spin-offs. Dead Island 2 was finally released in 2023 after a series of delays, and it lived up to its predecessor&#39;s promise. It&#39;s non-stop, high-octane action. Its gory systems of dismemberment and fast-paced zombie takedowns create the perfect balance between absurdity and realism. Dead Island 2 was nominated for Best Action Game at The Game Awards 2023, and got a four-star review from Screen Rant.





 Paranormasight Is A Wildly Creative Horror Visual Novel 
On Android, iOS, PC, And Switch
        

Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is just that - a paranormal mystery following seven cursed unfortunates as they investigate urban legends against a backdrop of 1980s Tokyo. Paranormasight is full of creative scares, like a giant, house-crushing foot, but its greatest strength is its approach to horror storytelling. The visual novel is divided into character-based chapters, and each one has multiple branching paths to determine who lives and dies. Its creepy atmosphere, memorable characters, and engaging mystery have earned Paranormasight overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam, and a Metacritic average of 85.





 World Of Horror Is A Retro-Styled Lovecraftian RPG 
On macOS, PC, PS4, PS5, And Switch
        

In early access since 2020, but finally released in time for Halloween 2023, World of Horror takes inspiration from the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and Junji Ito to create a work of cosmic horror. Across 20 different investigative episodes, players will navigate an innovative system of turn-based roguelite combat, in which they&#39;ll have to master different enemies&#39; weaknesses and queue up strings of status effect-inflicting attacks.
Story choices matter in World of Horror: the slightest slip-up could lead to an inescapably bad ending. And it&#39;s all rendered in a wonderfully drab, monochrome one-bit aesthetic that harks back to the oldest generation of PC games. World of Horror has overwhelmingly positive overall reviews on Steam, and an 81 average on Metacritic.





 Lethal Company Was 2023&#39;s Biggest Indie Horror Surprise 
On PC Exclusively
        

  Lethal Company  


  Platform(s)    PC     Released    October 23, 2023     Developer(s)    Zeekerss     Publisher(s)    Zeekerss     Genre(s)    Comedy , Survival Horror ,  Sci-Fi    


No one saw Lethal Company coming. Released in early access to little fanfare, it soon skyrocketed to top spots on some of Steam&#39;s most prestigious rankings. At the time of writing, Lethal Company is the top-selling game on Steam by revenue - and it only costs $9.99 USD. It also hit 100,000 concurrent players during the month of November, receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews.
Lethal Company is a survival horror game in Phasmophobia tradition. Players must travel to abandoned, alien-infested bases across desolate moons, bringing back scrap to sell to the nameless Company that employs them. It&#39;s delightfully chaotic in co-op, and its use of proximity voice chat adds an extra layer of immersive creepiness.





 Lies Of P Is Like The Bloodborne Sequel That Never Was 
On macOS, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, And Xbox Series X/S
        

  Lies of P  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PlayStation 5     Released    September 19, 2023     Developer(s)    Round 8 Studios     Publisher(s)    Neowiz     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Fantasy , Adventure    


Lies of P is the dark, edgy adaptation of The Adventures of Pinocchio players never knew they needed. In it, the fresh-faced marionette explores a ruined city in the aftermath of a bloody puppet revolt. Most surviving humans remain shuttered indoors, for fear of a strange disease that turns the afflicted into rampaging, mutated monsters. There&#39;s plenty of horror in the jerky, unnatural movements of high-strung bosses, the masked avengers who prowl the streets, and the machinations of scheming puppet master Gepetto.
Lies of P is set apart by its unique take on Soulslike combat, along with a storytelling mechanic that alters the plot depending on how often Pinocchio lies. And it&#39;s all wrapped up in the beautiful bow of a Victorian Gothic aesthetic, with gaslit alleys and cobblestone streets creating a shiveringly ominous atmosphere. Lies of P was up for two awards at TGA: Best RPG and Best Art Direction. It won neither, but is still widely regarded as one of the best Soulslikes in recent memory.





 The Dead Space Remake Is A Faithful Adaptation Of A Horror Classic 
On PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S
        

  Dead Space (2023)  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    January 27, 2023     Developer(s)    EA Motive     Publisher(s)    Electronic Arts     Genre(s)    Survival Horror    


The original Dead Space, first released in 2008, was a groundbreaking mix of horror and science fiction. Inspired by Resident Evil and space-set horror films like Alien, Dead Space follows engineer Isaac Clarke as he explores a ship infested with mutated, reanimated corpses called Necromorphs. It successfully applies the survival horror, zombie-fighting formula to a unique sci-fi setting. Terrifying alien creatures roam cramped hallways, physics puzzles block paths forward, and resources are few and far between.
The 2023 remake is largely faithful to the original, but all the changes it does make are overall improvements. With better graphics, a handful of story tweaks, some rejiggered level layouts, and stunningly immersive sound design, Dead Space&#39;s 2023 remake is the definitive way to experience the game. It currently has a Metacritic average of 89.





 The Resident Evil 4 Remake Is A Pitch-Perfect Revival 
On iOS, iPadOS, macOS, PC, PS4, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S


 







  Resident Evil 4 Remake  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Steam , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 24, 2023     Developer(s)    Capcom Division 1     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Survival Horror , Action    


The original Resident Evil 4, released for the GameCube in 2005, is a serious contender for best horror game of all time. It has a brilliantly hair-raising atmosphere, set in and around a haunted castle replete with flickering torches and animated suits of armor. It&#39;s silly, but it&#39;s also terrifying: it lands somewhere between Scooby-Doo and Midsommar. It puts a unique twist on both classic Resident Evil gameplay and plot, a game-changer for the series in various ways. This was the first RE to use an over-the-shoulder perspective, speeding up its action gameplay. And for once, its enemies aren&#39;t mindless zombies: they&#39;re brainwashed cultists infected with a parasitic fungus.
RE4make is an almost perfectly intact adaptation of the original game, with something to offer for players both old and new. It changes just a few things, but all for the better. It adds a variety of new melee attacks, which makes combat much more dynamic. It gives formerly one-note characters like Ashley, Luis, and Krauser a bit more plot to chew on. And of course, the remake looks and sounds better than ever before. Resident Evil 4 got a four-star review from Screen Rant, and was nominated in three categories at TGA: Best Sound Design, best Action-Adventure Game, and Game of the Year.





 Dredge Is A Relaxed Indie Fishing Game With A Terrible Twist 
On PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, And Xbox Series X/S


 







  Dredge  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 30, 2023     Developer(s)    Black Salt Games     Publisher(s)    Team17     Genre(s)    Adventure , Simulation    


Dredge starts out as a perfectly innocent fishing sim. A Fisherman drifts about an idyllic archipelago, casting out their lines and selling their catch for a profit. But once the sun sets, things get weird. They start reeling in mutated eels, seeing ghostly ships in the distance, and feeling like they&#39;re being watched, even in the pitch black of night at sea. Eventually, giant monsters rise out of the ocean and give chase.
Dredge&#39;s cute, cel-shaded graphics hide a wealth of terrible secrets. And yet, it&#39;s as relaxing and satisfying to play as a straightforward fishing sim. That is, until the Panic mechanic kicks in, increasing supernatural happenings the longer the Fisherman stays in the dark. Panic ensures that the player feels just as much stress as their avatar, for a simple yet incredibly immersive touch. Dredge received a 4.5 star review from Screen Rant, and was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards 2023.





 Alan Wake 2 Is The Best Horror Game Of 2023 
On PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S


 







  Alan Wake 2  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , PC , Xbox Series X/S     Released    October 17, 2023     Developer(s)    Remedy Entertainment     Publisher(s)    Epic Games     Genre(s)    Survival Horror    


Alan Wake 2 is everything a good horror game should be. It&#39;s the perfect marriage of Resident Evil-style third-person shooter gameplay and mind-warping plot. It nails each of those elements, with its light-based combat and impossibly strange visuals. It&#39;s challenging, yet satisfying. It achieves surrealism as only the interactive medium of video games can, with doors that don&#39;t lead to the places they should, and environments that flicker in and out. It contains themes about trauma, redemption, truth, and fiction. It seamlessly ties in with the first Alan Wake, Alan Wake&#39;s American Nightmare, and Control, forging connections for fans of those games while still being its own, unique whole.
Alan Wake 2 got a five-star review from Screen Rant, and was tied for most-nominated game at TGA 2023; it and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 were nominated for eight awards each, including Game of the Year. Alan Wake 2 took home three: Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, and Best Game Direction. It may not have won Game of the Year, but it&#39;s still the best horror game of 2023.
2023 was indeed a standout year for horror games, but 2024 and 2025 might be poised to outdo it. Between all the new Silent Hill titles slated for release, teases for more Resident Evil remakes, and more DLC coming to Alan Wake 2 soon, it looks like horror games are only going to get better. But until all that comes out, it&#39;s the perfect time to catch up on the best horror games of 2023.
