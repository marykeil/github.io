# There s One Major Problem With Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet s Epilogue


## SUMMARY 






  The recently released epilogue, Mochi Mayhem, extends the adventure and introduces a Mythical Pokémon, but it can only be accessed through a presumably limited-time Mystery Gift.   Tying the DLC epilogue to a time-sensitive delivery method is a mistake, as it limits the availability of significant story content and feels exploitative.   It&#39;s currently unclear if the epilogue Mystery Gift will be permanently available, if some other method of accessing it will be introduced, or if it will eventually become lost media.

## Literature Review

The Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet DLC epilogue Mochi Mayhem is an exciting addition to the game, but it&#39;s implemented in a somewhat concerning way.




The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has received an epilogue, but there&#39;s one crucial problem that casts a shadow on what is otherwise a nice sendoff for the games. Released in two parts, The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero introduces the new areas of Kitakami and Blueberry Academy and adds more characters, Pokémon, and features to the game. Although the DLC doesn&#39;t fix every issue present in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it does help flesh out an experience that could otherwise feel lacking.




Most recently, the epilogue released for the DLC, titled Mochi Mayhem, ties together elements of both The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk by taking the player character and a group of friends back to Kitakami to deal with a strange event. It&#39;s not material that&#39;s crucial to the overall story, but it does help extend the adventure a bit and introduces a Mythical Pokémon. Unlike the main parts of the DLC, it&#39;s not that hard to start the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet epilogue and finish it within an hour or two, but its brevity isn&#39;t the main problem.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Epilogue Is Time-Sensitive 
          




The big issue with the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet epilogue has to do with how the content is delivered to players. Unlike the rest of the DLC, which can be digitally purchased and downloaded through the standard store interface, Mochi Mayhem can only be accessed by activating a Mystery Gift in the game. This gift is received through connecting to the Internet on the in-game Poké Portal, after which the Mythical Peche Berry needed to play the epilogue and get the mythical Pokémon Pecharunt will appear among the key items in the trainer&#39;s inventory.



The physical copy of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC comes with The Teal Mask on the cartridge, while The Indigo Disk still has to be downloaded from the Internet.




In some sense, this is a charming method of delivering content, but its long-term implications are much scarier. Mystery Gifts in Pokémon are never around forever, with specific expiration dates that come much, much faster than the cessation of online services for a system that would otherwise spell the end of access to some DLC. Although the window of availability for the Mythical Peche Berry hasn&#39;t yet been clarified, it&#39;s likely that many future players will ultimately have to miss out on the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet epilogue.




Requirements to start the epilogue are fairly stringent, necessitating that players complete the game and specific Pokémon Scarlet and Violet post-game content, but luckily there aren&#39;t any restrictions on activating the Mystery Gift for current players. The gift can be claimed before finishing up the story and will simply sit around in the Key Items until it can actually be put to use. Considering the presumed lack of permanence for the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero epilogue accessibility, taking this course of action would be wise for anyone who currently owns the DLC.



 A Pokémon DLC Epilogue Should Be Permanent 
          

Mythical Pokémon have always inspired some division among the Pokémon community, as the idea of time-limited availability excites some fans and alienates others. Regardless of its general merit, tying a Mystery Gift to content presented as an epilogue is a fundamental mistake. The last opportunity to see the characters of a story and finish up a paid DLC package shouldn&#39;t be time-sensitive, and it&#39;s a very different scenario from the general idea of a Mythical Pokémon happening to pass through.




                  Pokémon’s Gen 10 Games Need To Reveal One Character’s Mysterious Fate   Pokémon’s Generation 10 games offer the perfect opportunity to reveal what happened to one popular character whose fate has been left a mystery.   

Tying certain bonuses to specific windows plays into the sense of community that Pokémon focuses on, but it also feeds into an aggressive release cycle and the general fear of missing out. Locking a DLC epilogue behind a potentially time-limited delivery method punishes players who don&#39;t buy the games or DLC close to their initial release. Although this can make Mythical Pokémon feel more special for those who do have them, throwing any significant story content into the mix promises that the complete product won&#39;t always be available, and it all feels particularly exploitative considering that the franchise is geared towards children.



 Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Mystery Gift May Not Expire 
         




There&#39;s some possibility that the Mystery Gift of the Mythical Peche Berry might not go away, as no expiry date was given for when the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gift will no longer be accessible. At minimum, the lack of clarification would generally imply that the window will be more generous than most, since the gift isn&#39;t likely to be yanked without warning. This doesn&#39;t dispel a lingering sense of unease, however, with equally little indication that the gift is intended to be permanent (or at least as permanent as online support for the Nintendo Switch).

                  Every Legendary &amp; Mythical Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: Teal Mask, Ranked   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s new DLC, The Teal Mask, introduces fun new powerful pocket monsters to the game, including the Teal Mask’s namesake.   

The biggest concern is that there&#39;s no real precedent for a Mystery Gift not expiring in Pokémon, so there should be clearer communication if this does indeed work differently from prior ones. The only other hope for future access to the epilogue would come from receiving a Mythical Peche Berry in a trade or the even longer shot of hoping for a Pokémon Scarlet and Violet remake someday that would resurrect past events. Considering the surplus of more widely beloved games in the franchise that haven&#39;t yet been remade, the latter concept seems unlikely at any point in the foreseeable future.




Mythical Pokémon can be a cool reward for being a part of the Pokémon community, but it ultimately doesn&#39;t feel right for an epilogue to center around something that seems to be time-sensitive. Although the easy availability of updates has offered some major advantages to video games, the lack of an ability to simply buy a complete product on a disk or cartridge is troublesome, and this is one scenario that exhibits those drawbacks particularly well. The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet might not be around forever, and there&#39;s no good reason for that to be the case.
