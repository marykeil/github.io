## Literature Review

An intense survival horror game set within the Jurassic Park franchise has been revealed at 2023&#39;s The Game Awards.




Jurassic Park: Survival has been revealed at 2023&#39;s The Game Awards. The first trailer consisted primarily of pre-rendered footage, but it did give a great idea of the game&#39;s tone and atmosphere, which seems far more intense than most other games in the franchise.




Despite Steven Spielberg&#39;s 1993 classic blockbuster film having its suspenseful moments, it was decidedly more family-friendly than the novel by Michael Crichton that it was based upon. Crichton&#39;s novel featured incredibly graphic descriptions of deaths and was generally darker in its tone. Many fans have hoped to see this kind of tone adapted elsewhere, with many looking to games for this after the success of previous dino-horror titles such as Dino Crisis, which came out just two years after Jurassic Park&#39;s darker sequel, The Lost World.

                  Every Jurassic Park Video Game, Ranked   Over the near-30 years since the franchise&#39;s inception, dozens of games based on Jurassic Park have been released. Here&#39;s how they stack up.

Several Jurassic Park titles in recent years have leaned into the management side of the doomed amusement park with titles such as Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis and the Jurassic World: Evolution series daring players to do a better job than inGen at containing its dinosaurs and keeping its visitors safe. However, as its name would suggest, Jurassic Park: Survival takes a far different approach and focuses on the survival aspect seen throughout the novels and movies.


 

While information about the game is scarce, the reveal trailer - which can be found on the Jurassic World YouTube channel - introduced the main protagonist, Maya, an InGen scientist who was unable to evacuate Isla Nublar during the events of the first movie. The trailer showed some iconic locations from the Jurassic Park movie that have now been abandoned completely, as Maya tries to send out a call for help.






Another game called Jurassic Park: Survival was in development in the early 2000s, but was canceled. This would have been a very different game as it was intended as an action-adventure title made to tie into the 2001 film, Jurassic Park 3.




Through the pre-rendered footage, Maya can be seen hiding in the Visitor Center&#39;s kitchen from the venom-spitting Dilophosaurus, who she later runs into in the jungle before finally coming face to face with the T-Rex outside the main gates of the park. The final seconds of the trailer showed that the title will have first-person gameplay, much like other upcoming dinosaur survival horrors such as Deathground and The Lost Wild, and even Krenautican&#39;s fan-made attempt at a Jurassic Park game, Jurassic Park Operations.

This intense in-game footage showed Maya trying to escape the T-Rex by hiding in a tunnel and closing a gate as the dinosaur charged toward her, and also featured a showdown with a Velociraptor upon a collapsing dock. There is currently no release date confirmed for Jurassic Park: Survival. However, the trailer did state that the title is due to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles.
