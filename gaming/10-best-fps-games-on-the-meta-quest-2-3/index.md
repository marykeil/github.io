## Literature Review

The Meta Quest 2 and 3 are the perfect platforms for FPS games, and there&#39;s no shortage of excellent titles that take full advantage of the immersion.




The Meta Quest 2 and 3 are home to many of the best virtual reality games out there, and FPS games are one genre that has particularly flourished on the platform. Pointing and shooting from a first-person perspective translates exceptionally well to a VR headset, delivering very direct action that tends to feel especially immersive. Even those who struggle to aim well on a mouse or gamepad can often adapt quickly in VR, as the skill set is more similar to classic light gun games or actual target shooting than anything else.
Virtual reality has also allowed many FPS games to get particularly creative, and many of the best titles on Meta Quest 2 and 3 take advantage of these opportunities. Whether diving deep into authentic physics, exploring rhythmic possibilities, or manipulating time itself, there&#39;s no shortage of interesting angles in the genre. From cartoony fun to gritty realism, VR FPS games have something to offer everyone.









 








 10  Arizona Sunshine 2 Is Zombie-Killing Fun 
Vertigo Games, 2023
        

   


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , PSVR 2 , Steam     Released    December 7, 2023     Developer(s)    Vertigo Games     Publisher(s)    Vertigo Games     Genre(s)    Action , First-Person Shooter , Virtual Reality     ESRB    M     Prequel    Arizona Sunshine    


Arizona Sunshine 2 doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel for FPS games on Meta Quest 2 and 3, but it does build upon the first Arizona Sunshine with moderate improvements to elements like enemy variety (and the addition of a dog). As a zombie-killing extravaganza, the game is more or less what it says on the tin, so anyone who thinks it looks fun will likely enjoy the experience. The price is a bit rough considering the competition, but if money isn&#39;t an object, it&#39;s one of the better options on the market.
            
 
 &#34;All The Fun, None Of The Gore&#34;: Arizona Sunshine 2 Review 
The long-awaited sequel, Arizona Sunshine 2, promises its players a return to an immersive zombie-killing experience, but this time, with a Buddy.








 9  Resident Evil 4 VR Has FPS Scares 
Armature Studio, 2021


 







The original Resident Evil 4 and the remake on modern consoles might both be third-person games, but the VR translation hops into first-person for immersive action. Converting a game&#39;s perspective doesn&#39;t always work out, but Resident Evil 4 VR does it quite well, and the result is one of the best FPS experiences on the platform. The focus is more on survival and scares than on gunplay, but there&#39;s still plenty of shooting to be found in the adventure.





 8  Pavlov Shack Has Many Game Modes 
Vankrupt Games, 2023
        

Pavlov Shack spent years in an early access form before finally releasing in full on the Meta Quest platform in 2023, but even in an incomplete state it was well worth a look. In finished form, it&#39;s a clear standout among VR FPS offerings, with excellent weapon physics and mechanics and a variety of fun game modes. Pavlov Shack lacks certain touches present in the PCVR alternative Pavlov VR, but more populated servers help make up for the difference.
            
 
 How To Charge Controllers For Meta Quest 2 
Controllers used for the Meta Quest 2 use power similarly to controllers of normal consoles used for gaming, but they do not charge in the same way.








 7  Pistol Whip Adds Rhythm To The Mix 
Cloudhead Games, Ltd., 2019


 







 


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 4     Released    November 7, 2019     Developer(s)    Cloudhead Games     Publisher(s)    Cloudhead Games     Genre(s)    Rhythm , FPS    


Pistol Whip isn&#39;t quite a traditional FPS, focusing on linear rhythm action in a way that shares a lot of DNA with Meta Quest excercise hits like Beat Saber. Constant thrills and dynamic level design make it an easy sell, and updates have added content and improved the game since its launch. With streamlined, colorful graphics that keep the focus on the targets, Pistol Whip is an instant dopamine hit for any FPS or rhythm fans.





 6  Contractors Is The Best For Mods 
Caveman Game Studio, 2020
        

Contractors has a lot of general appeal as an FPS on Meta Quest 2 and 3, with a Call of Duty-esque balance of realism and arcade elements that makes for plenty of fast-paced fun. What really sets it apart, however, is the modding community. There&#39;s no shortage of exciting community-made maps and more, keeping the experience consistently fresh several years after its release.





 5  Into The Radius Is An Immersive FPS 
CM Games, 2022
        

Into the Radius isn&#39;t a casual pick-up-and-play FPS on Meta Quest 2 and 3, but anyone who appreciates deep mechanics and immersion should be able to find plenty to enjoy. A bleak and atmospheric environment is particularly reminiscent of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, but Into the Radius is by no means a clone, and it might be even more lonely and unnerving. It has one of the most passionate communities of any VR game, and it doesn&#39;t take much playtime to realize that there&#39;s a good reason.





 4  Onward Is An Impressive Mil-Sim 
Downpour Interactive, 2020
        

Onward is the perfect VR choice for anyone interested in a more realistic and tactical experience. Although the learning curve can be higher than more casual alternatives, the realism and potential for mastery can be especially rewarding.   teamwork is definitely necessary in squad-based multiplayer modes, but a strong community makes this goal generally attainable.





 3  The Light Brigade Has A Roguelike Twist 
Funktronic Labs, 2023
        

The Light Brigade was a major 2023 addition to the world of FPS games on Meta Quest 2 and 3, and it immediately stood out as among the best that the platform has to offer. Roguelike design elements and fantasy trappings give it the flavor of the best Meta Quest RPGs, while the physics-based gunplay is exceptionally fun. Developer Funktronic Labs has also been great about post-launch support so far, so there&#39;s no real downside to checking out The Light Brigade.





 2  SUPERHOT VR Is An Inventive FPS 
SUPERHOT Team, 2019
        

The original version of SUPERHOT was one of the most exciting and innovative shooters yet conceived, making the most of a fascinating gimmick where time only moves when the player does. This concept gets infinitely better in VR, where physically ducking behind an object or craning around a corner gives enemies the opportunity to react. It&#39;s not a long game, but it&#39;s an exceptionally memorable one, and some tough challenges and speedrunning potential give it a healthy dose of replayability.





 1  Bonelab Brings Major Physics Possibilities 
Stress Level Zero, 2022


 







The experimental possibilities of FPS games in VR are well-explored in Bonelab, a game that makes excellent use of a powerful physics system established in Stress Level Zero&#39;s Boneworks. As nothing more than a sandbox, it would be a fairly worthwhile experience, but the inclusion of an actual story mode elevates its value to the next level. Although gunplay is only one part of Bonelab, it&#39;s a virtual reality FPS through and through, just one with plenty of other fun elements to explore on Meta Quest 2 and 3.
