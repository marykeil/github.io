## Literature Review

The Viltrumite warrior Omni-Man has arrived in Mortal Kombat 1, with various moves, kombos, and fatalities that threaten every Realm&#39;s safety.





Before you start challenging others with Omni-Man, you may want to go to Practice mode to figure out all the character&#39;s Kommands and attack combinations. While Omni-Man&#39;s simple fighting style makes them one of the best fighters for beginners in Mortal Kombat 1, there are still some things you should explore first. Getting a feel for a new fighter is one of the best ways to prepare you for the many battles to come.



Keep in mind that every character has Basic Attacks that can be performed on the ground or in the air. There are a great many of these attacks which can be hard to remember unless you study what they do in Training Mode.





 Every Omni-Man Move 
          

Omni-Man has a variety of Basic Attacks, Aerial Attacks, and Special Moves that define how you&#39;ll play the character, with Special Moves having the ability to be enhanced by spending a bar of meter. A unique aspect of Omni-Man is that his Special Moves can be performed on the air or ground equally. Many fighters are limited by attacks they can only do while on the ground, such as the Neoplasm move from Havik in Mortal Kombat 1.

 The Best Kameos for Omni-Man 
          

The best Kameos to use with Omni-Man are Darrius, Jax, and Kung Lao for how they synergize with the character&#39;s moves. Darrius can extend the combos of Omni-Man with his spinning kick attack, which is easy to connect with moves that take place from the Viltrumite Stance. Meanwhile, Kung Lao&#39;s low hat attack provides a good opening for Omni-Man&#39;s offense, which can be a bit straightforward in Mortal Kombat 1.

                  10 Best Mortal Kombat 1 Kameos   Kameos are fighters who assist you in battles of Mortal Kombat 1, with the best ones offering you extra combo tools, space control, or even movement.   

Jax perhaps has the strongest connection with Omni-Man as a Kameo, mainly because of their unblockable ground pound attack. The enhanced version of Viltrumite Stance can actually dodge the ground pound, which normally would affect your character just as much as your opponent&#39;s. This lets you create set-up attacks that are almost impossible to avoid in Mortal Kombat 1, especially if your rival is in either corner.

 Sample Omni-Man Kombos 
          

While a variety of Kameos can extend the combo potential of Omni-Man, there are a few sample attack patterns you might want to practice first. Here are some examples you could learn that will be reliable in many different circumstances (with PS5 input):

  Square -&gt; Triangle -&gt; Down, Back, X -&gt; Square -&gt; Jumping Forward &#43; Square, Triangle, Square &#43; X   Forward &#43; Circle, Square -&gt; Square, Triangle -&gt; Down, Back, Square -&gt; Square -&gt; Jumping Forward &#43; Triangle, Square, Triangle   Back &#43; Square, Square -&gt; X -&gt; Down, Back, X -&gt; Square -&gt; Jumping Forward &#43; Triangle, Square, Triangle -&gt; Forward &#43; R2 -&gt; Jumping Forward &#43; Square, Triangle, Square &#43; X  

Keep in mind that you may want to find a way to integrate a Fatal Blow into your combo if you are looking to maximize Omni-Man&#39;s damage, or end a sequence in a cool way. This move may be done by pressing R2 &#43; L2 on a controller, with Omni-Man&#39;s in Mortal Kombat 1 starting as a series of fast, teleporting punches. Using this attack does carry some risk, since it can be really easy for the opponent to punish you if you miss.

 How to Do Omni-Man Fatalities 
          

Just like any other character&#39;s finishing moves, you have to unlock Fatalities in Mortal Kombat 1 by leveling up the fighter through multiple battles. Thankfully, Omni-Man comes with one Fatality already available, making only one that you have to gain later. To trigger these brutal moves after winning a match, simply use these inputs:

 Fatality  Range  PlayStation  Xbox  Switch   Trained Killer     Down, Down, Back, Circle  Down, Down, Back, B  Down, Down, Back, A   Like Putty  Mid  Down, Forward, Back, X  Down, Forward, Back, A  Down, Forward, Back, B

 How to Play Omni-Man 
          

Omni-Man is a close-range, rushdown character that uses his impossible speed and heavy-hitting attacks to constantly be on the offensive when possible. Their quick moves from Basic Attacks and ability to avoid projectiles through Viltrumite Stance give Omni-Man consistent ways to close the gap between him and his opponent. The flying dashes while in the air also allow you to reach enemies that are comfortable staying away in Mortal Kombat 1.

The best way to play Omni-Man as you learn more techniques is to use speed to get in, spend meter on powerful Special Moves, and utilize mid-striking attacks to pressure your opponent. The right Kameo can enhance your strategy further, with the kombos, fatalities, and moves of Omni-Man depending on your ability to create a team that takes advantage of the Viltrumite&#39;s strengths in Mortal Kombat 1.
