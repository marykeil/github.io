## Literature Review

Spin-off titles for characters in Baldur’s Gate 3 could expand the series set by Larian even more while offering an alternative to turn-based combat.




There are several characters in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are worth their own spin-off title in the series. The popular RPG by Larian Studios features a compelling story and part of that narrative value stems from the complexity of the characters that are presented throughout the campaign. These include the companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, as well as several friendly – and even unfriendly – NPCs that players may encounter during their journeys along the Sword Coast. While there are a lot of interactable NPCs that do not have much to offer players, especially the citizens of the city in Act 3, several others are carefully developed over time.
This article contains spoilers for Baldur’s Gate 3.
The main story sees players in search of the means of removing the illithid tadpole from their heads. However, in this adventure, they may be able to participate in several different side quests in Baldur’s Gate 3, which further enhance the immersion into the game’s world of high fantasy. Some of these quests are connected to special items and weapons, such as the one involving the Blood of Lathander in Baldur’s Gate 3. Others are focused directly on characters and their needs, be they Origin companions like Shadowheart and Astarion or more standard NPCs that are met.
 : 10 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Characters Who Should&#39;ve Been Romance Options









 








 10  Astarion 
Vampire May Cry


 







Being able to spend more time with everybody’s favorite vampire in Baldur’s Gate 3 through a spin-off title would likely be well-received by fans of Astarion. The witty and sarcastic vampire fledgling is one of the most adored companions among the group, largely because of how well-written the character is, as well as how well-played he is by actor Neil Newbon.
An interesting take for an Astarion spin-off game would be putting players in control of him after he kills Cazador and ascends as a vampire lord. Logically, this would either have to canonize the event in Baldur’s Gate 3 or be developed around the character’s own imagination prior to the encounter – perhaps during a long rest in camp. A turn-based RPG may not work for such a tale, but having a newly ascended vampire lord star an action-fueled hack-n-slash title could make sense.





 9  Dammon 
A Blacksmith’s Tale
        

The Infernal blacksmith Dammon is one of the most interesting characters in Baldur’s Gate 3. A vital part of Karlach’s story quest, Dammon can be encountered throughout all three acts of the game. This tiefling that can be saved during the arc in the Emerald Grove is not a warrior, but a master blacksmith who worked in the Hells.
Having a prequel game starring Dammon could give players more insight into what the Hells look like and the politics in play there. While it is unlikely most types of combat would work for him, a gameplay approach similar to the A Plague’s Tale series could expand the world of Baldur’s Gate 3 with an alternative playstyle.





 8  Karlach 
Zariel’s Warriors


 







While the best moments with Karlach in Baldur’s Gate 3 are also her most endearing and heartwarming ones – provided by Samantha Béart’s incredible acting – it is extremely fun to see her rage in combat and wreak havoc against enemies. This could be further expanded on with a spin-off title focused on the tiefling and her time serving Zariel during the Blood War.
Based on Karlach’s own reports of her time in Avernus, a musou-like game that sees the character wiping out legions from the Hells would make for a perfect match. The gameplay style inspired by Koei’s Dynasty Warriors would match how Barbarian’s usually operate in fights. The lack of a finesse to combat and sheer brutality in Karlach’s skill set would drive the game forward, especially if it ended with her boarding the illithid ship that kicks off Baldur’s Gate 3.





 7  Alfira 
Bard Hero
        

A small spin-off game that would work pleasantly and give players an opportunity to experience the Sword Coast away from the continuous bloodshed would be a title focused on Alfira, the tiefling bard. One of the most charismatic beings in Baldur’s Gate 3, Alfira is a bard who is still learning on the go – and while she may lack technical prowess at the beginning, she makes up for it with heart.
A narrative-driven musical game with Alfira at the forefront would make for a marvelous new perspective on the lives of people enduring hardships in Faerûn. In a spin-off like this, players could get to meet her teacher Lihala, and witness how her non-Tav romance in Baldur’s Gate 3 with Lakrissa develops as the tiefling’s group moves away from the Emerald Grove and toward the city.





 6  Halsin 
Druid Branch Solid
        

Halsin has one of the most interesting and mysterious backstories in Baldur’s Gate 3, and his century-long lifespan allows for several moments that could be explored in a spin-off title centered around him. The character played brilliantly by Dave Jones could be shown during his initial battle against Ketheric Thorm and how he is connected to Thaniel.
The spin-off title could also show flashbacks to highlight his years of imprisonment as a young man during his exploration of the Underdark, which could be used as narrative tools to help him unlock battles when working with the Emerald Grove. Of course, this title could end with him starting to lead the group of druids after the demise of the former Archdruid.





 5  Shadowheart 
The Last Of Shar


 







Like Halsin, Shadowheart also has a very interesting backstory – in fact, her past is a vital part of her current self, regardless of what path she takes in the campaign of Baldur’s Gate 3. This backstory seems rich and could be explored in a spin-off game showing Shadowheart’s years of training to serve Shar.
Because of her aptitude for stealth and darkness, a survival horror title in the style of The Last of Us would fit Shadowheart perfectly, even if set in a high fantasy world. With limited resources and Cleric spells still in development, pushing the character into a survival horror to fight for her survival under Shar’s tutelage would help develop her a lot more. This would also give players more time with one of the most beloved companions in the game, who is well-interpreted by Jennifer English.





 4  Orpheus 
Githyanki Tensei
        

Although only mentioned throughout the game, the War of the Comet led by Orpheus in Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of the most intriguing pieces of history – and one that determined the fate of the Githyanki as a whole. His spin-off could be a long-form RPG that shows Orpheus expanding his party and growing alongside them, while also highlighting the vile intentions of Vlaakith I.
Although his story ends in tragedy, with most of his Honor Guard defeated and him imprisoned in the Astral Prism, the story of his adventures defying Vlaakith and her deal with Tiamat could be shown. This could also be presented in the form of flashbacks while Orpheus is imprisoned, like Joker in Persona 5.





 3  Orin The Red 
Prototype Blood
        

Controlling villains often leads to very involving storytelling – or, at least, gameplay – and a spin-off title featuring Orin the Red could make for solid entertainment. The changeling bhaalspawn is one of the most notable antagonists in Baldur’s Gate 3, and her shapeshifting trickery is enough to make players anxious constantly throughout Act 3.
If these abilities of manipulation and bloodshed were put to use in a game centered around Orin, players could have a lot of fun. With an essence much like a title from the Prototype series, but with a lot more stealth and deceit, the bhaalspawn could spill blood throughout all of the Sword Coast – and, of course, this could all be non-canonical, result of her daydreaming ahead of her controlling the Elder Brain.





 2  Withers 
The Legend Of Jergal
        

Although subjectively inserted into the narrative, Withers is actually one of the most important characters in the story of Baldur’s Gate 3. The undead being can be found in a temple to Jergal, and that is no coincidence. While it is uncertain if Withers is a servant to the God of Death or if he is Jergal himself, he is directly responsible for the ascension of the Dead Three.
Jergal resurrected the Dead Three, which could have been the reason he was judged by Helm. A spin-off game focusing on this important moment could take an experimental action-RPG approach, much like the titles in the Legend of Zelda series. In fact, Withers and Jergal do not even have to be playable, but instead have an original character uncovering the secrets of the God of Death.





 1  Oathbreaker Knight 
Oathbroken Souls
        

Paladins in Baldur’s Gate 3 can break their Oaths and become Oathbreakers, a special subclass that unlocks unholy abilities. The leader of this faction of sorts is the Oathbreaker Knight, a menacing-looking figure that appears once a Paladin commits a terrible deed. This NPC is actually the first Oathbreaker, though he never tells the player why and how he broke this Oath.
A soulslike spin-off game revolving around the nameless Oathbreaker Knight would have excellent gameplay value. Because of the mystery surrounding his actions, the title could have multiple endings, much like in Dark Souls and other similar games. There are many ways that the world of Baldur’s Gate 3 could expand, especially through spin-offs that offered an alternative gameplay style.
