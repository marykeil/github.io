## Literature Review

From delta to gonk, becoming familiar with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s slang terms and what they mean can be crucial to getting the most out of the experience.




For the cybernetic citizens of Cyberpunk 2077, futuristic slang is part of everyday conversation - but for players conversing in the modern day, it can be a point of confusion. The varied vernacular of Night City can be jarring at first, especially to those who are not versed in the complex, intricate lore of the long-running Cyberpunk franchise. At times, it can even feel like V and their acquaintances are speaking another language entirely. However, by familiarizing themselves with even just a few Cyberpunk 2077 slang terms and their definitions, one can cultivate a far richer and more immersive gameplay experience.




The game introduces just a handful of the slang terms created for the original Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk RED tabletop roleplaying games. The Cyberpunk 2077 universe is so heavily influenced by the technology of the day, even becoming a very part of the humans themselves, that it is natural for some of the technical jargon to have also woven its way into everyday expressions. Much of Cyberpunk slang is a combination of these technical terms along with foreign words and, of course, an edgy attitude.

 Cyberpunk Glossary - All Cyberpunk 2077 Slang Explained 
         

Cyberpunk 2077 incorporates many unique terms and phrases into the story, various missions, and even just NPC chatter to help build a more immersive world for the player. There are a lot of unfamiliar expressions that V will run into, but there are some that are more likely to be heard than others. Simply through playing the game, it is possible to get the general connotation behind many of them, but the immersion can be much more satisfying when having a full understanding. Below are some of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s most common slang terms and what they mean:




 Term  Definition   Apogee  The best or the greatest.   AV  An abbreviation for Aerodyne Vehicle, a popular type of jet-powered, flying automobile in Cyberpunk. AVs are usually reserved for the wealthy or the Trauma Team.   Borg  Short for cyborg. It may be used derogatorily to judge those who have undergone numerous cybernetic surgeries or nearly replaced their entire bodies.   Boostergang/Booster  A gang (or a member of a gang) characterized by their extreme territoriality and use of cybernetic implants. This is the most common type of gang in Night City. Boostergangs can consist of just a handful of punks, or they can be a large, organized group like Maelstrom.   Bourgie/Bourgy  A classist insult meaning &#34;low class.&#34;   Braindance/BD  A virtual experience that allows the user to relive someone else&#39;s memory, including their thoughts, emotions, and pain. Braindance editors, such as Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Judy, can edit raw footage to turn it into a marketable product, usually for entertainment purposes.   Chippin&#39; In  To install cyberware, especially for the first time. Alternately, to hook up to any machine. This is also the name of a single by Johnny Silverhand&#39;s band, Samurai.   Choom/Choombah  Derived from &#34;choombatta,&#34; this is a Neo-African American word of endearment for a friend or family member. It has been appropriated widely by non-Black residents of Night City as a rough synonym for &#34;bro&#34; or &#34;bud.&#34;   Chrome  Another word for cyberware. Can also be used as a verb, to describe the action of receiving cybernetic implants.   Corpo  A word for a corporate employee, often used in a derisive way. It&#39;s also one of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s branching lifepaths.   Culture Vulture  An entertainment journalist, especially those who profit off of publicizing tragedy.   DataKrash  The near-total collapse of the Net, orchestrated by legendary Netrunner Rache Bartmoss in the early 2020s.   Deckhead  Another word for a Netrunner. So-called for the cybernetic implant in their brain, which lets them enter and hack the Net.   Delta  To leave, usually with haste.   Dirty  Analog, low-tech, or outdated. This derogatory label may be applied to items unconnected to the Net, or to anything suspiciously antiquated.   Dock  Sexual intercourse, especially a casual hookup.   Dorph  Endorphins; a synthetic recreational endorphin. Hackers in Night City are known to take Dorphs to boost their performance.

Jaina  A term of endearment associated with Chicano culture.   Joytoy  A sex worker. Can be gendered as Joyboy or Joygirl.   Kibble  Processed food, especially government rations which resemble dry dog food (because it literally is - Kibble was first created by a dog food manufacturer).   Kibble Card  A ration card. Analogous to food stamps or EBT, many of Night City&#39;s poorest are reliant on a deteriorating welfare state which allots them low quality food.   Linefoot  A term for a non-Nomad, usually used by Nomads.   Netrunner  A specialized, skilled user of the Net. Anyone can use the Net, but Netrunners have augmented themselves to hack into the Net&#39;s Menu and traverse cyberspace with grace.   Netpig  A derogatory term for Netwatch, the private police force that monitors the Net since DataKrash.   Nomad  Residents of the Badlands outside Night City. For characters in Cyberpunk 2077, this is a lifepath defined by belonging to a close-knit clan.   Posergang/Poser  A gang (or a member of a gang) that operates with the primary goal of achieving a certain body type or physical appearance.

Preem  Derived from the word premium, this casual term means &#34;cool&#34; or &#34;dope.&#34;   Ripperdoc/Ripper  A cybernetic surgeon. While any doctor specializing in outfitting patients with cyberware could be called a ripperdoc, the term carries a streetwise connotation that often denotes a practitioner who caters to Night City&#39;s criminal element.   Rockerboy/Rockergirl  A musician that doubles as an activist, using their talents to lead social movements.

Trauma  Short for Trauma Team, Night City&#39;s heavily-armed squad of medical first responders. Trauma Team clients may be referred to by the type of insurance they&#39;ve purchased. Those with the most expensive package, Platinum coverage, are guaranteed better service than those with a Silver or Gold package.   Vidiot  A video game or virtual reality addict.   Weefle  An inexperienced Netrunner.   Zeroed  Killed. This term may be a reference to &#34;zeroing&#34; in tabletop RPGs, when a player character loses all of their hit points.   






                  10 Things Cyberpunk 2077 2 (Orion) Must Include   Not much has been revealed yet for the future sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, but here are some things that the upcoming Project Orion needs to include.   



 Origins Of Cyberpunk 2077 Slang 
          

Cyberpunk 2077 comes from the expansive world created by Mike Pondsmith originally for Cyberpunk, a tabletop role-playing game series. To make it into the video game it is today, there are naturally some minor differences between the TTRPG and CD Projekt Red&#39;s sci-fi RPG. However, the majority of Cyberpunk 2077 remains canonical to the events of Pondsmith&#39;s expansive fictional world. As such, a lot of interesting background for the game and further definitions of the slang that is used in Cyberpunk 2077 can be gained by giving the TTRPG a spin, or from reading one of the many sourcebooks that accompany the series.




Enjoying the futuristic world of Cyberpunk doesn&#39;t necessarily require players to study the ins and outs of either the TTRPG or even the slang meanings. The game uses many colloquialisms throughout, however, so it is good to know some of the terms, but generally, there is enough context around the use of the terms to be able to interpret them without the need for research. Becoming familiar with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s most common slang terms and what they mean - alongside some first-person exposure to the streets of Night City - will have V prepared to flatline some gonks and earn some eddies in no time.
