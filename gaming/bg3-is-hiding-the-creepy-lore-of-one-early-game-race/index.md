# BG3 Is Hiding The Creepy Lore Of One Early-Game Race


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 touches on violent and tragic associations of DnD races, but some fantasy races, like gnolls, are left unexplored in terms of their creepy lore.   The story of Yeenoghu, the god of gnolls, could have added more intrigue and peril to Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as it aligns thematically with the game&#39;s exploration of loyalty and agency.   The gnoll encounter in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 represents a significant difficulty spike and could benefit from more build-up and exploration through a quest line to enhance the player experience.

## Literature Review

Despite the plethora of creepy material in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, one part of Act 1 barely skims the surface of a fantasy race&#39;s darkest secrets.




There&#39;s plenty of creepy content in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but some dark secrets involving a fantasy race that appears in the first act of the game are left untouched. As a video game adaptation of the tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has decades of storytelling to draw from. While plenty of DnD material focuses on the fun side of adventuring, the vast and varied lore of the Forgotten Realms setting also features a surplus of macabre concepts and unsettling implications.




A wide variety of DnD races make appearances in Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and the game doesn&#39;t shy away from many of their more violent or tragic associations. Goblins speak callously of eating dwarves, racist sentiments toward tieflings is on full display, and the rabbit hole of disturbing mind-flayer powers is a defining element of the entire story. Other fantasy races, however, appear as little more than throwaway enemies and consequently fail to receive the same amount of attention. One such example lies in the encounter with gnolls, which shows off their violent capabilities but doesn&#39;t touch on the creepiest parts of their lore.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Doesn&#39;t Talk About The God Of Gnolls 
          




The story of gnolls in the Forgotten Realms starts with the demon lord Yeenoghu, an indiscriminate butcher who left a trail of bloodshed that picked up packs of hyena followers. Yeenoghu made these followers the first gnolls, transforming them from typical scavengers to bloodthirsty foes. Gnolls that end up earning the special attention of Yeenoghu can be further raised to become his &#34;fangs&#34;, possessing them with demonic spirits. Hyenas that feed on enemies killed by fangs become gnolls themselves, perpetuating the cycle of unrelenting violence and spreading Yeenoghu&#39;s influence through widespread slaughter.

                  5 D&amp;D Cambions &amp; Demons Perfect For A Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 DLC   Because Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a pseudo-sequel to 5e&#39;s Descent into Avernus, having a host of hellish new NPCs in the DLC would make perfect sense.   

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 doesn&#39;t ignore the grosser aspects of gnolls entirely, showing the blood-soaked transformation from hyena to gnoll whenever the situation arises during the gnoll encounter. The lore, however, is never something that&#39;s presented at the forefront of events, leaving them as obviously vicious but otherwise fairly routine foes to take care of in combat. Considering how many Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players are likely unfamiliar with the depths of DnD lore, diving more into the nitty-gritty of gnolls could have been a fascinating way to add even more intrigue and peril to Act 1 of the game.






 Yeenoghu Is A Perfect Fit For Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Yeenoghu&#39;s story also makes for a perfect thematic element in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as doing the dark bidding of gods and rulers who may not deserve their following players a major role in the game. Both Lae&#39;zel and Shadowheart have narrative opportunities to question the loyalties they&#39;ve been taught, and getting more in-depth on a race that doesn&#39;t possess enough of the same agency to stand much chance at an analogous redemption arc could provide an interesting foil. It might run the risk of feeling repetitive, but focusing on the inevitability of brutality that Yeenoghu generates could give it a memorably oppressive flavor.

                  Devora Wilde Wants Players To &#34;Give Lae&#39;zel A Chance&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Devora Wilde discusses playing githyanki companion Lae&#39;zel, the complexity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s narrative and githyanki culture clashes.    




Speaking to the gnoll leader in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 does reveal that the Absolute has some kind of influence over them, which they only seem to understand as a Voice that&#39;s pushing them to act against their nature in certain regards. Delving deeper into Yeenoghu could reveal the power struggle between a god of sheer brutality and a more insidious force both seeking to control the same group, doubling down on the ideas raised by the goblins&#39; apparent abandonment of their traditional god Maglubiyet. The gnolls seem more resistant to the Absolute&#39;s influence thanks to their more feral nature, which could make for an interesting contrast to explore.



A couple of gnolls also appear as proper thralls to the Absolute in Act 2, proving that they can be controlled entirely, but this encounter also keeps the focus off of Yeenoghu.






 The Gnoll Fight Deserves More Build-Up In BG3 
          




Another reason why gnolls could benefit from being fleshed out in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 comes down to the simple fact that the Act 1 encounter with them represents a significant difficulty spike from other fights that appear at a similar point in the narrative. There are multiple ways to use the environment or employ allies in the struggle, but playing optimally mostly evens the odds rather than tilting things in the party&#39;s favor. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a hard fight every now and then, and the gnoll challenge doesn&#39;t tip over into being completely unfair, but building it up more could make it feel more appropriate.

                  All Differences In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Tactician Mode   Tactician mode ramps up the challenge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it does so in a more complicated way than just buffing enemies and nerfing the party.   

As it stands in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the only real ramp to the fight presents itself through the hyenas that can be fought immediately before encountering the full party of gnolls, which can be reborn as gnolls in the bloody lead-up. Expanding to an actual quest line would be an interesting way to explore the ideas further, and the ravenous nature of gnolls provides plenty of opportunities for clues or NPCs left behind to spark a proper hunt for the perpetrators. This could also offer a more thorough avenue through which lore about the gnolls could be sprinkled in along the way.






 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Keeps The Focus On Goblins In Act 1 
         

Ultimately, the likely reason that gnolls aren&#39;t explored more in Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 comes down to the fact that goblins are the more significant focus in that arc of the story. This works as an explanation for the lack of orcs in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and a number of other similar exclusions, as there&#39;s obviously a point where things can simply become too cluttered. From the development end, being able to focus on certain side stories and ideas also helps streamline the process, a fundamental necessity in a game as jam-packed as Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 where not every cool idea can make it in.

Although it might make sense that gnolls don&#39;t get much of a spotlight in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, it doesn&#39;t make mourning what could have been any easier. Gnollls and their god Yeenoghu are a truly terrifying force in the Forgotten Realms, and only alluding to aspects of their nature and history loses out on some interesting potential. There&#39;s still more than enough creepy lore to enjoy in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the dark story of the gnolls is one missing element that could have been something special.
