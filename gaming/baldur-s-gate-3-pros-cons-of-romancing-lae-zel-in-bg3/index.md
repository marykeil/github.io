## Literature Review

Maintaining a true emotional connection with the githyanki warrior might be harder than one would think, but the payoff is totally worth it. 




Out of all the romances in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, a love interest with the githyanki Origin character Lae&#39;zel is one of the most rewarding the game has to offer. While at first, her rather harsh exterior wouldn&#39;t seem to lend itself well to a budding romance, sticking it out could result in one of the most satisfying character arcs possible. Like most romances in BG3, it won&#39;t be easy, however, and there are a lot of pros and cons that come with romancing the savage warrior.




At the beginning of the game, sparking that initial physical attraction with Lae&#39;zel is actually one of the easier tasks in the game, depending on the choices made. Tav and Lae&#39;zel meet early in the narrative - she&#39;s actually the first companion they recruit in Act 1. That being said, digging a layer deeper to really get to know the githyanki will require dedication, as most romances in BG3 don&#39;t really start developing until Act 2 and beyond.

                  Devora Wilde Wants Players To &#34;Give Lae&#39;zel A Chance&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Devora Wilde discusses playing githyanki companion Lae&#39;zel, the complexity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s narrative and githyanki culture clashes.    


 Lae&#39;zel Loves Carnage 
          

As a frontline githyanki warrior, it makes a lot of sense that Lae&#39;zel would appreciate a little bloodshed. Like other Origin characters, Lae&#39;zel prefers certain decisions and actions, especially those that demonstrate intimidation or dominance. Unlike other Origin characters&#39; amorous subplots, like romancing Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Lae&#39;zel prefers being direct over deception, even (and sometimes especially) if that directness leads to charging head-on into a battle.




Lae&#39;zel appears as the first recruitable companion on the Nautiloid (not counting the baby brain pet). This first meeting will set the tone for their relationship, as her personality becomes apparent immediately. By being pro-githyanki, telling off Shadowheart when she discriminates against Lae&#39;zel, and taking a direct approach to other early tasks and missions, the relationship between Tav and Lae&#39;zel will quickly form, culminating in a rather steamy romance scene early on in the game if all the right choices are made. This, however, is just the tip of the iceberg, as she makes it pretty clear that she&#39;s mostly entertaining it for physical pleasure rather than emotional romance.

However, her direct and all-out-attack style isn&#39;t completely conducive to a deceitful playthrough that uses wit, personality, and dialogue to progress through the campaign. That being said, her stances are a bit more nuanced than mindless violence. Her actual main goal is mission completion - in essence, tadpole removal - and helping other giths. However, her mission changes course over the course of the game, and takes on a very different form by Act Three.




As of Patch Four, released in November 2023, it&#39;s harder to romance Lae&#39;zel in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 than ever before. Instead of simply requiring a high enough approval rating, Lae&#39;zel now demands that her prospective partners prove themselves through actions as well as words. It couldn&#39;t hurt to wipe out the goblins in Act 1, and to side with the githyanki during the party&#39;s many encounters with them.

But no matter what, by showing independence and strength, it&#39;s more than possible to play a cerebral game while still satisfying her. Pretty much taking the alpha stance on any scenario will result in actions that she approves of. Those who want an entirely passive playthrough probably won&#39;t have a chance with the githyanki warrior, though.



 Shadowheart Doesn&#39;t Approve Of Tav Romancing Lae&#39;zel 
          




When it&#39;s said that Lae&#39;zel really loves her people, the githyanki, it&#39;s a bit of an understatement. Being anti-githyanki in any way will likely cause her to disapprove, which stands at odds with another one of the game&#39;s main Origin characters and fan-favorite, Shadowheart. Early in the game, the distaste between the two is more than apparent, with Shadowheart, the half-elf, having a lifelong hatred for the gith. The two eventually develop a mutual understanding after adventuring together, but pursuing a relationship with Lae&#39;zel means being unable to pursue a romantic relationship with Shadowheart in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

Indeed, those planning on RPing an anti-gith character won&#39;t be able to romance Lae&#39;zel, but then again, it doesn&#39;t make much sense if the character doesn&#39;t like the former serfs of the Mind Flayers. In order to romance Lae&#39;zel, Tav will have to be fully on board with total Illithid destruction.



 Lae&#39;zel Might Be Receptive To An Open Relationship 
A Glitch Allows Players To Romance Lae&#39;zel And Karlach At The Same Time
         




While it would seem like the warrior gith would be down with a more open relationship style, that&#39;s not actually the case. In Act 2, romances get a little more serious, and Origin characters will typically prefer to be the only ones within the group with a romantic relationship with the player-created character. However, Reddit user iWatchAnimeIronically may have found a solution to their would-be polyamorous woes. In other words, while they&#39;ll usually allow Tav to spend a night in the company of one of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s non-Origin characters, like Halsin, they begin to demand exclusivity among their tadpole-infected peers in Act Two.

If Tav accepts Lae&#39;zel&#39;s apology in Act 2, then immediately goes to camp, leaves camp, goes back to camp, and finally talks to Karlach, it&#39;s possible to maintain the relationship with Lae&#39;zel and Karlach at the same time. If true, this would mean that romancing Lae&#39;zel opens up one of the few reported paths to a poly relationship with Origin characters in the game. That being said, this might be a glitch that is later patched out, which would probably mean that both characters would ask for an exclusive relationship in Act 2 as usual.




                  One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Romance Option Deserves Way More Love   Larian Studios revealed some statistics about Baldurâ€™s Gate 3, and one romance option definitely deserves more love and attention from players.   

From the looks of things, beyond this one potential glitch, romancing Lae&#39;zel means being unable to romance any other Origin character past Act 2. Players can still romance some NPCs they meet along the way, including many of those at Sharess&#39; Caress in Rivington. But as far as Origin characters go, it&#39;s one romance per customer.



 Lae&#39;zel Romance Shows The Most Growth 
          

Perhaps, out of all the characters in the game, Lae&#39;zel&#39;s romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 results in one of the most drastic examples of character growth throughout the entire game. While she starts as a hardened warrior solely concentrating on supporting and saving the githyanki while completing the mission at hand, a tenderness evolves in her throughout the playthrough.




In addition to the romantic character arc, Lae&#39;zel&#39;s main character arc is actually quite compelling, as she transforms from a gith concerned with a mission into someone who grows into their own individuality. In many respects, her emotional and character growth is perhaps one of the most profound in the game. Another great thing about her is that she typically goes along with things throughout the main story arc, as long as they are pro-githyanki and anti-Illithid, making romancing her one of the less complex from a narrative perspective than other Origin characters in the game.

This changes significantly by the end of Act 3, however. Lae&#39;zel demands that the party side with Orpheus in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and if they don&#39;t, she&#39;ll react violently. Siding against Orpheus in Act Three will cause Lae&#39;zel to break up with Tav immediately, and quite possibly to attack the rest of the party. This does create a couple of other wrinkles in the story. For one thing, doing so means Karlach will have to turn into a Mind Flayer. And in the end, Tav will have to choose whether to spend the rest of their life with Lae&#39;zel, or let her return to her people.




As one of the central characters in the main story, Lae&#39;zel is an important party member, no matter what. However, she can become even more important depending on the choices made. The way that the githyanki play into the overarching BG3 narrative makes this the case. It may not seem this way in Act 1, but romancing her over time and breaking down her emotional barriers is actually pretty engaging and can result in a solid playthrough. Indeed, there are few cons to romancing Lae&#39;zel, and many more pros, unless the player seeks a romantic relationship with Shadowheart or another Origin character.

Pursuing a relationship with Lae&#39;zel will eventually lead her to lower some of her walls and let Tav into her heart. This results in one of the most tender moments the game has to offer, especially considering her personality upon the first encounter and throughout the entirety of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
