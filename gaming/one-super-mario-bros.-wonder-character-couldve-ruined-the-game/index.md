# One Super Mario Bros. Wonder Character Couldve Ruined The Game


## SUMMARY 



  Florian&#39;s design in Super Mario Bros. Wonder reflects his role as the prince of the Flower Kingdom, and some fans were concerned about a potential connection to the obscure Mario anime film, The Great Mission To Rescue Princess Peach.   The 1986 anime film introduced the character Kibidango, who is revealed to be the true form of Prince Haru of the Flower Kingdom.   Nintendo has kept its film adaptations separate from its games, and it is unlikely that Florian&#39;s design in Super Mario Bros. Wonder was influenced by the 1986 anime or its characters.

## Literature Review

The Flower Kingdom prince featured in Super Mario Bros. Wonder was not the first such character in Mario’s history, which made some fans concerned.




The Flower Kingdom adventures of Super Mario Bros. Wonder have entertained fans of classic side-scrolling platforming action, but some veteran Mario aficionados were concerned that Prince Florian might have held a secret that would be bad news for the high-jumping plumber. Florian is a diminutive creature with a body similar to a Wiggler, the caterpillar-like entities introduced in Super Mario World. Wigglers are shown with flowers growing from their heads, which makes Florian’s design a good fit for the royalty of the Flower Kingdom. However, the Flower Kingdom appeared much earlier in an obscure chapter of Mario’s history, and that connection could have set Prince Florian up as a potential rival.

While the recent Super Mario Bros. movie was a mainstream success, earlier adaptations of Nintendo franchises were more divisive. The live-action Super Mario Bros. movie from the 1990s was an odd take on the all-ages game series, but the 1986 anime might have been even stranger. Super Mario Bros. – The Great Mission To Rescue Princess Peach included an anime original Mario character, Kibidango. This bright blue dog led Mario and Luigi to the Mushroom Kingdom in the anime film. While Kibidango remains an ally throughout the story, Bowser’s defeat undoes the curse placed on him, revealing his true form as Prince Haru of the Flower Kingdom, Peach’s true love.

                  Super Mario Bros. Wonder Is The  st We’ll Ever Get To M-Rated Mario   Most longtime franchise fans who play Super Mario Bros. Wonder will pick up on the evident psychedelic, trippy nature of the Wonder Flower sequences.    





 A Different Flower Kingdom Prince Was In The Mario Anime Film 
          

Mario is, of course, crestfallen that the princess he pined for was destined to marry Haru. The anime film is not terribly well-known, though its recent 4k restoration has brought it to the attention of a somewhat wider audience. There are multiple reasons to suspect a connection between Haru and Florian beyond their obvious roles as princes of the Flower Kingdom. In his dog form, Haru bore a strong resemblance to a Wiggler as well, despite the anime film predating Super Mario World by four years. Fortunately, Florian remains a tiny Wiggler to the end in Mario Wonder.



Super Mario Bros. Wonder is not the first Mario game to venture outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, as Super Mario World featured Dinosaur Land, and Super Mario Land took place in Sarasaland, among others.







Fans might enjoy Super Mario Bros. Wonder DLC characters, but Kibidango is unlikely to make the cut. Though The Great Mission To Rescue Princess Peach boasted better animation than the various Western Mario animated series, even in its 4k release, it remains a strange curiosity more than anything. Those who were concerned that Florian might actually be Haru probably do not need to worry since none of the games to date have acknowledged the 1986 film. Still, it is possible that Florian’s design was in part a nod to Kibigango, the secret prince of an earlier incarnation of the Flower Kingdom.


 

                  Every New World In Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Ranked Worst To Best   Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduces a variety of new worlds in the Flower Kingdom, some of which are more familiar at their core than others.   




The name Florian derives from the Latin words for “blossoming” and “flower,” and Haru means “Spring” in Japanese. Kibidango is a form of Japanese dumpling, a reference to the shape of the blue dog’s body, but the other monikers all hold a similar thematic connection to the Flower Kingdom. It certainly makes sense for Nintendo to avoid any direct reference to a largely forgotten film from nearly 30 years ago, but an Easter Egg referencing some of the stranger chapters from Mario history might be welcome. Fans of classic side-scrolling gameplay can still rest assured Nintendo has not abandoned 2D platforming since Super Mario Bros. Wonder delivers a great game.

 Nintendo Has Kept Film Adaptations Separated From Its Games 
          




It is only through fan efforts that films like The Great Mission To Rescue Princess Peach are available for viewing. Like the 2006 Animal Crossing anime adaptation, Mario’s 1986 anime has never been officially localized outside of Japan. A few references to the film might be appreciated by longtime fans, such as a power up block that yields Mario ramen (a fourth-wall-breaking gag from the anime movie) or even an outfit where Luigi wears his sleepy-time hat and robe, as depicted in an early scene. Still, the live-action movie is better remembered, and Mario Wonder is unlikely to receive a DLC option for a Bob Hoskins Mario skin.

                  One Super Mario Bros. Wonder Item Proves A Dead Series Needs A Comeback   Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings nostalgic feelings of past games in classic platformer action, but there is one series that needs a full comeback.   

The Chris Pratt-voiced Super Mario Bros. movie was a hit, and the upcoming film adaptation of The Legend of Zelda could let another Nintendo classic franchise shine on the silver screen. Still, Nintendo has not let the tone of the successful Mario movie impact Super Mario Bros. Wonder, so the chances of an even more obscure film granting Florian a secret identity were always slim.
