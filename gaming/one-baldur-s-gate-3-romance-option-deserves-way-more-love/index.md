## Literature Review

Larian Studios revealed some statistics about Baldur’s Gate 3, and one romance option definitely deserves more love and attention from players.




One of the several romance options in Baldur’s Gate 3 definitely deserves a lot more love, especially after the developer Larian Studios shared some interesting statistics about players’ most common love interests. In the popular RPG, players can progress through the story and, during the course of the catastrophic story, develop relationships with most of their closest companions. Some of the options include fan-favorite companions like Astarion and Shadowheart in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as well as the vile Minthara. There are also a few one-time flings that players can engage in, though they lack more emotional depth and tend to only satisfy primal desires.

The actual romances, however, are worked upon throughout the entire campaign, usually starting off with some awkwardness considering how the party forms, and later blooming into what can often be a beautiful couple. Of course, this also depends on how players approach the game. If they are inclined to be evil, this will cut them off from certain characters. There are, however, great romances for evil playthroughs in Baldur’s Gate 3, especially if they embrace the Dark Urge companion trait, which unlocks a completely new storyline to follow. Among good and evil playthroughs stands one of the best romance options. Unfortunately, it seems like they are ignored by most players.

 Lae’zel Is Only The Third Most Romanced Character In Baldur’s Gate 3 
         




Recently, the developer made a post on the official Larian Studios profile on X and revealed a fair share of interesting details about how players engaged with Baldur’s Gate 3 since its launch in August. According to the studio, Lae’zel is the third most romanced character in the game, behind Karlach in second place and Shadowheart in first. This means that, out of the female Origin Companions, Lae’zel is the least romanced character. Minthara is less romanced than the githyanki fighter, but getting close to her involves making a series of evil decisions, which are not often taken by characters aligned with a good playthrough.



The other stats revealed by Larian include players’ preferred classes, subclasses, and races, as well as how many players finished the campaign, how many fireballs were thrown, and how many times players were transformed into cheese wheels in Baldur’s Gate 3.






 Romancing Lae’zel In Baldur’s Gate 3 Is One Of The Most Endearing Experiences 
          




The fact that Lae’zel is the least romanced female character among the Origin Companions is quite a shame, considering how endearing the relationship built with her is. Of course, she can initially come across as brash and rude, but the fact is that she was raised in a very specific environment that determines her behavior to be like. Lae’zel is, in fact, one of the most lovable traveling companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, even if she does not show that through her choice of words. Her training as a fighter with the sole mission of killing is seen from the get-go, but she has a huge heart beneath her armor.

As players allow themselves to get closer to Lae’zel, they will understand that she enjoys assertive dominance. This is one of the reasons that she was so easily romanceable at launch – players who faced some of the first threats in the game with strength were later met by her reacting positively to such a demonstration. The immediate impression following this is that Lae’zel enjoys the pleasures of life and wants nothing else with the player. However, as they continue to journey together, they understand more about Lae’zel, her upbringing, and how she was deceived. Romance aside, Lae’zel already has one of the best story arcs in the game.




When players choose to romance Lae’zel in Baldur’s Gate 3, they are treated to one of the greatest heartfelt and slow-burn love stories available. There is a certain sense of helpfulness in being with her as she surpasses her sense of disillusion after being betrayed by her queen, Vlaakith. The githyanki queen is using and manipulating Lae’zel and, in truth, the entire githyanki civilization. She even feeds off her most trusted warriors who rise to the post of ascended – while they are promised to become immortal heroes, they actually become zombies, completely drained of their life force by the lich queen.

While most of the companions have very appealing conclusions to their story, especially when they are a romantic pair with the player’s character, Lae’zel stands out immensely. The version of Lae’zel presented toward the end of her good story arc is completely different from herself at the beginning of the campaign, and for the better – the bad ending for Lae’zel, especially after the patch 5 update in Baldur’s Gate 3, is quite sad and tragic. The githyanki warrior arguably presents the largest character development among the Origin Companions. Granted, Minthara presents the largest twist in terms of personality, but the requirements to romance her are a lot harder.




Romancing Lae’zel, on the other hand, is a lot easier and more worth it when it comes to emotional depth. She is mostly receptive to the player’s choices, be they good or evil – the main secret is to often indulge in carnage and be githyanki-friendly. Players can eventually help drift her away from her admiration of Vlaakith, but in doing so they end up helping the entire githyanki civilization, which ends up being positive in her eyes. Witnessing how Lae’zel opens up to the player over dozens of hours is also worth the investment and, unless they are interested in romancing another companion, Lae’zel should always be considered.

Of course, romancing Shadowheart and Karlach is not at all bad. Both of the other female Origin Companions have endearing story arcs that overlap very well with their romantic arcs. Shadowheart’s romance is also quite heartfelt, especially if players help her overcome her unlawful devotion to Lady Shar in Baldur’s Gate 3. Once the grasp of the goddess of darkness is removed, Shadowheart will see things more clearly and open up like a book meaning to be read. Karlach, on the other hand, is a sweetheart from the start and is a big bundle of love that cannot share too much lest she will hurt those around her.




Nevertheless, Lae’zel being the third most romanced character behind Karlach and Shadowheart is not doing her justice. As one of the most interesting characters in the game, both as a companion and a romantic partner – especially when combined – the githyanki warrior should be grasping the hearts of more players. Hopefully, over time, players will reply Baldur’s Gate 3 in another way and be able to witness exactly how precious sharing love with Lae’zel truly is.
