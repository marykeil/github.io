## Literature Review

Figure out how to solve all the circuitry puzzles in the limited-time Motherboard Troubleshooting game mode available in Genshin Impact 4.2.





A total of 80x Thelxie’s Badge are needed to unlock the free copy of Freminet, while 100x are needed to max out the gains from the event – with the exception of tiered rewards based on performance in other game modes, such as Purgation Counterstrike. Even if the Motherboard Troubleshooting mini-game offers only a few Thelxie’s Badge per level, there are a total of eight stages to complete, which can round up a total of 32x copies of the item. The free Primogems in Genshin Impact are also well worth the effort, as you can get hundreds of them by simply playing limited-time game modes.

 Stage 1 
Basic Circuit Structure
         

The first stage in the Motherboard Troubleshooting event mode in Genshin Impact is called Basic Circuit Structure. Outside the one that appears in the event’s campaign mode to introduce you to the game mode, this is, indeed, the most basic puzzle in the series. This is also the first puzzle that introduces you to the concept of inductive switches on the board.

          

As exemplified in the solution, you will want to run the circuit over the switch and then toward the end. By passing over the switch, you will trigger the correspondent mechanism, even if afar. This will be key to solving most of the other Motherboard Troubleshooting circuitry puzzles that come later – though they will get more complex over time.






 Stage 2 
Beginner Open /  d Principle
          

Beginner Open /  d Principle is the name of the second stage of the Motherboard Troubleshooting game mode and will introduce you to two copies of Thelxie on the circuitry board in Genshin Impact. Even if they do not reach their respective goals simultaneously, they do need to make it to the end.

          

To solve stage 2, you will need to guide Thelxie 1 over the inductive switch and into his final destination while taking Thelxie 2 around the first goal and into the second destination. By the time Thelxie 2 reaches their goal, Thelxie 1 would have already activated the switch to allow Thelxie 2 to pass through and complete the puzzle.






 Stage 3 
Concise Synchronous Strategy
          

Stage 3 of the Motherboard Troubleshooting mode is called Concise Synchronous Strategy and the layout of the circuitry puzzle in Genshin Impact justifies its title. This will be a synchronous approach to the puzzle and will see both Thelxies on the board heading over to their respective destinations in parallel paths.

          

As exemplified in the solution, Thelxie 1 will run in a straight path toward its goal, triggering two inductive switches on their side, which will fix the broken path on the other and allow Thelxie 2 to get to its final destination. This is quite an easy puzzle to solve, but crucial to further understanding the mechanics at play.






 Stage 4 
Ingenious Assemblage Ideas
          

In Ingenious Assemblage Ideas, the fourth stage of the Motherboard Troubleshooting game mode in Genshin Impact 4.2, you will be presented with a circuitry puzzle that initially looks quite confusing. The strategy here will be making one of the two Thelxie’s activate both inductive switches.

          

The solution to solving the stage 4 puzzle is to make Thelxie 1 run straight toward its goal, minimizing the usage of equippable circuits, while Thelxie 2 activates both inductive switches before heading toward its destination – this may require some critical thinking before completing it.






 Stage 5 
Efficient Signal Distribution
         

In the fifth stage of the Motherboard Troubleshooting mode, named Efficient Signal Distribution, you will be introduced to a new mechanic, in which inductive switches do not exactly fix circuit lines, but alter their direction in Genshin Impact. Following this, you will often see the Thelxie’s share paths before diverging.

          

As exemplified in the solution, stage 5 will see Thelxie 2 head off first, running through the inductive switches that will alter the path twice so that Thelxie 1 can then reach its destination. Thelxie 1 will arrive later, but that does not really matter.






 Stage 6 
Precise Sequential Ranking
          

Stage 6, Precise Sequential Ranking, may look a bit confusing, but its solution is not too complicated. Like in Stage 5, the sixth level will have a Thelxie in Genshin Impact run over inductive switches that will alter the course for the other Thelxie. There is a big difference between this stage and the previous one, however.

          

Here, Thelxie 1 will make a straightforward run toward its goal. Thelxie 2, on the other hand, will have to take a longer path outside before heading over to the path that leads to its goal. This will allow Thelxie 1 to have time to reach its destination before Thelxie 2 activates the inductive switch that will unlock the second portion of its path.






 Stage 7 
Asynchronous Signal Processing
          

In the seventh stage of the Motherboard Troubleshooting mode in Genshin Impact, named Asynchronous Signal Processing, a similar tactic will be employed. If you run each Thelxie straight toward its goal, one of them will fail. As such, you will need to gain some time with one while the other completes its path.

          

This time, the solution will require Thelxie 2 to run straight toward its goal, while Thelxie 1 makes a brief detour on the bottom portion of the circuitry board before heading over to the required path. With this, Thelxie 2 will trigger the inductive switch that will unlock its own path and reach the goal, followed by Thelxie 1, which will trigger the change of path once again and head over to its destination.






 Stage 8 
Comprehensive Control And Mastery
         

The eighth and final stage of the Motherboard Troubleshooting game mode is called Comprehensive Control and Mastery in Genshin Impact. This stage is also the most complicated to figure out, though the solution seems obvious once known. The last part of the circuitry puzzles will take into consideration everything that was learned throughout the previous phases.

          

The solution to stage 8 is making Thelxie 2 have a straigh approach to the puzzle, while Thelxie 1 takes a long detour at the bottom of the board. With it, Thelxie 2 will head out, go through the first path split and activate the red inductive switch that will trigger its path. Thelxie 1, in turn, will take some time and then activate the blue switch that unlocks its path and run over the red switch again, to correct the path for itself. The puzzles are not terribly difficult, but knowing how to solve them in advance is a way of optimizing your time in Genshin Impact.
