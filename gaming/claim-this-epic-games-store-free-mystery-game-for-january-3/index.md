## Literature Review

The Epic Games Store is continuing its holiday celebration with yet another free game giveaway on January 3, this time a stealth action adventure.




The Epic Games Store&#39;s holiday celebrations have extended into the New Year, with 2024&#39;s third free game being A Plague Tale: Innocence. It&#39;s available to download for free starting January 3, 2024, at 11 AM ET, and will be redeemable for 24 hours, at which point it will be replaced by the next day&#39;s offering. A Plague Tale: Innocence follows EGS&#39;s free game for January 2, 20 Minutes Till Dawn.




January 3&#39;s free game marks the 15th daily game given away this holiday season via the Epic Games Store. A different game is given away each week by the digital storefront throughout the year, but the giveaways have become daily to celebrate the holidays. Those who claim the free download of A Plague Tale: Innocence will have access to the game for life, no strings attached. Interestingly, its sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, is one of January 2024&#39;s PlayStation Plus games, so anyone also subscribed to any tier of PS&#43; can get the entire series thus far at no additional cost.

                  A Plague Tale: Innocence Review - Heart Pounding and Emotional   A Plague Tale: Innocence is the perfect combination of storytelling, action, and gameplay that proves that the world needs more single-player games.   


 A Plague Tale: Innocence Is Free From Epic Games Store On January 3 
          




Developed by Asobo Studio, A Plague Tale: Innocence is a narrative-heavy single-player game. It recounts the harrowing journey of siblings Amica and Hugo de Rune as they flee persecution during the French Inquisition in the 14th century. A Plague Tale&#39;s version of France is embroiled in the Hundred Years&#39; War, during which swarms of rats are spreading the Black Death, the deadliest bubonic plague pandemic in human history. With a concerted focus on stealth, the game usually tasks players with avoiding conflict and navigating a series of survival puzzles.

A Plague Tale: Innocence joins the Epic Games Store&#39;s daily free games lineup this holiday season on the side of a few other notable AAA releases. Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is a bit older, but Ghostwire: Tokyo, The Outer Worlds, 2022&#39;s Saints Row reboot, and Ghostrunner have all been given away by EGS in the last couple of weeks. Part of the fun, however, has been seeing the smaller projects on offer – such as 20 Minutes Till Dawn, Snakebird Complete, Cursed to Golf, and others – which have given players an incredible amount of variety in gameplay.




A Plague Tale: Innocence is a great and unique title to be offered free on the Epic Games Store, even if it flew further under the radar than its more acclaimed, Game of the Year-nominee sequel. The Epic Games Store holiday celebration is coming to a close, however, as A Plague Tale: Innocence is the second to last that will be given away daily. Unless the storefront has other plans, EGS should resume its weekly giveaways after the final free daily game on January 4.
