## Literature Review

Super Mario games are not known for offering any sort of online multiplayer capabilities, yet Super Mario Bros. Wonder may be breaking new ground.





Super Mario Bros. Wonder released on October 20 2023, exclusively for Nintendo Switch. The 2D side-scrolling platformer brings a more traditional feel to the series, mixed in with some incredibly chaotic new features and power-ups. Like Super Mario 3D World and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, the game includes multiplayer for up to four people in local co-op, with an unusual approach to online multiplayer gaming that feels somewhat reminiscent of Mario Kart multiplayer.

 Super Mario Bros. Wonder Offers Unique Online Multiplayer 
          

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is breaking the mold of Mario games through its approach to multiplayer. With &#34;Live Shadows&#34; of other players around the world playing the game simultaneously, the new Mario experience incorporates some of Mario Kart&#39;s ghost-like time trials against other racers, except with some added benefits of assisting each other by providing items, reviving fallen players, or to cheer each other on. 



Private rooms can be created for friends to enjoy experiencing the game together or racing in speedrunning-type events as well, without the cumbersome mechanic of bumping into one another anymore.









 Creating Private Rooms Allows Friends To Play Together Or Race 
          

Long-distance friends with multiple Switch consoles and copies of the game are able to play Super Mario Bros. Wonder online in a private room with a couple of different options available. A private room lobby can hold up to 12 friends who can then break off into groups of up to four to enter levels together.

The online and local play can also be combined with two people per Nintendo Switch able to connect. Once in a level, the friends connected via the internet will be semi-translucent versions of their characters with their names listed above their heads, and they can play alongside each other. Though not able to touch directly, everyone within the same level can aid each other by giving items, helping bring characters back to life after they die, and more.




For a more competitive edge, rather than simply playing through a level, there is an option to host a Friend Race for up to four people from the private room. The race is treated much like a speedrun, with each of the players running and jumping their way through a level, avoiding enemies and pits, to reach the end first. Some races also include defeating bosses or finding the Wonder Seed in order to win.

 Play With Others From Around The World 
          

When opting to play Super Mario Bros. Wonder online, a general lobby will connect them to players around the world. As with lots of Nintendo Switch games though, there&#39;s no option to chat with other players, either by voice chat or via typing in the Nintendo app. This means Super Mario Bros. Wonder&#39;s general lobby is a safe environment for younger children. 




When playing online, other players will show up as semi-transparent Live Shadows who can be seen playing through the various levels in real-time. Though not specifically playing together, players can interact with each other by saving each other when one has lost a life, providing items to each other, or even sending an emoji. One fun extra mechanic Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduces is the addition of standees to assist other players too.



 What Are Standees &amp; Heart Points In Super Mario Wonder? 
          

During online play, there is a new item that allows players to leave a character standee wherever they would like to help others. These standees can revive a character that has died if they can reach it before the countdown finishes, so it is best to have them placed next to a dangerous area or trap. Standees come in various designs that can be purchased from the in-game shops to customize the look.




When a player touches a standee that was left by someone else online, they will see and then increase that person&#39;s heart points. Heart points are gained each time someone helps any other online player either through their standee or through their Live Shadow assisting someone with giving items, reviving, or interacting. Heart points don&#39;t serve a major purpose but can be used to track which players have helped others the most.



 Play With Family &amp; Friends In Local Co-Op 
         

Up to four local family and friends who want to play together can enjoy the couch co-op version of multiplayer gaming in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. There is a slight advantage of not having any of them shown as transparent images on the screen, but unlike online play, every person has to remain in the same area as each other. Local couch co-op will still be devoid of any bumping into each other&#39;s characters (which is a good change considering the size of the characters after getting an Elephant power-up) but can laugh with each other as they share a screen and make their way through each level.




Of course, Super Mario Bros. Wonder can also be enjoyed single-player, making this game perfect whether playing in a large group of friends, simultaneously with strangers from around the globe, or simply enjoying a solo gaming session. While its multiplayer could be improved, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has been heralded as one of the best side-scrolling Mario games of all time, in part thanks to its approachability for any friendship group.
