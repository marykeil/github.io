## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has many merchants to buy gear from or sell collected treasure to, but not all them are worth the visit and offer value for money. 




In the epic world of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 there is plenty of loot to be found to fully equip the whole party. While some of this can be found in chests or from looting fallen enemies, there are some great things to be purchased from the game&#39;s many merchants. From unique armor and weapons to spell scrolls and potions, vendors can be a great source for amazing items in BG3.
[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
From the beginning to the very end of Baldur’s Gate 3, there are amazing bargains to be had and fantastic gear to be found with the game’s various merchants. However, not all merchants are equal, and while the party should visit as many as they can for the best deal, some of the traders in BG3 are better than others. Whether because they have unique items that can&#39;t be found anywhere else or because they will offer the best deals when selling the party&#39;s collected treasure, these merchants are the best to keep an eye out for.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Volo’s Stock Is Limited But Useful 
Volo Will Trade If Surgery Is Refused
        

Volo will join the party camp in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 after being rescued from the goblins and will offer to help with the removal of the mind flayer parasite. If agreed to, Volo will do his best, fail, and give the unlucky patient Volo&#39;s Ersatz Eye before leaving. However, if his offer of amateur surgery is not taken, he will stay in camp until the end of Act 2, where he can be traded with. Volo doesn&#39;t have a huge array of items, but he does stock five Potions of Animal Speaking that will refresh and randomly assigned spell scrolls, which can sometimes include some high-level spells for Gale to learn.





 9  Arron Is An Excellent Low-Level Merchant 
Stock Up On Camp Supplies


 







Arron in the Druid Grove will likely be the first merchant many meet during any playthrough of Baldur’s Gate 3. Arron has some great stock for low-level characters, in particular, the Gloves of Missile Snaring. These rare gloves allow the wearer to use a reaction to reduce incoming damage from ranged weapon attacks by 1d10 plus their Dexterity modifier. If the magical items he sells don&#39;t tickle the party&#39;s fancy, Arron also stocks plenty of potions, arrows, and camp supplies for the journey ahead.
Arron will have better prices for druid characters, as his disposition towards them will be slightly higher. 






 8  Omeluum Has Good Magical Items 
Complete Their Quest To Unlock The Trader
        

Down in the Underdark, in the Myconid Colony, is an illithid named Omeluum who is studying the area with their companion Blurg. Omeluum will offer to help the party with their tadpole, and if the party completes the quest, they will offer to give the party a Ring of Mind-Shielding. While it is possible to convince Omeluum to hand over the ring, it is better to trade with them, as the mind flayer scholar has some great items. In particular, the Pearl of Power Amulet, which lets the wearer restore a spell slot of third level or lower, and the Ring of Salving, which restores additional hit points each time the wearer heals others.





 7  Lann Tarv Offers The Best Value For Money 
Passing A Skill Check Offers Better Prices
        

Lann Tarv is a bugbear who can be found inside Moonrise Towers in BG3&#39;s Act 2. Lann is interesting as a merchant as it is possible to increase his disposition towards the party to 100 by passing a skill check, therefore giving the best possible prices. While Lann does have some great stock, such as the Sentinel Shield, which grants plus three to initiative rolls and advantage on Perception checks, Lann&#39;s true value lies in his buying power. With the highest possible attitude, Lann will sell at lower prices but also buy at the highest, meaning he is one of the best merchants in the game to sell to.

Some Of The Best Armor In Act 3

Exxvikyap is very enthusiastic about making a sale, and with good reason, she has some fantastic armor for the party. Along with an array of arrows and weapons, Exxvikyap also stocks Elven Chain and the Bonespike Garb. The Bonespike Garb is great for barbarians, as it grants 15 temporary hit points when Raging and reduces all incoming damage by two. Meanwhile, the Elven Chain can be worn by any character as it grants the wearer proficiency in medium armor, as well as plus two to initiative rolls and advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

 5  Skittle Is An Usual Merchant 
Hard To Find But Worth The Trip
        

Skittle is a merchant that only a few will meet when playing BG3, as he can only be found in Heapside Prison in a cell. However, Skittle is not a prisoner and is, in fact, a rat who can be spoken to and traded with using speak with animals. Skittle will speak in rat-based puns and sells the key to Counting House Safe number two as well as the Elixir of Universal Resistance. The elixir does exactly as it sounds and grants resistance to all damage for 10 rounds in combat, making it extremely useful in the final battle of BG3.





 4  Roah Moonglow’s Selection Grows Each Time 
Can Be Found In All Three Acts
        

Roah Moonglow can be met during all three Acts of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and the Zhentarim merchant has some great stock each time. In Act 1 Roah can be found in the Shattered Sanctum close to Priestess Gut&#39;s quarters, where, among other items, they sell the awesome Blooded Greataxe, which deals extra damage when the wielder has less than 50% of their hit points. Roah can then be found in Act 2 in Moonrise Towers with extra stock in addition to any previously unsold items from Act 1. Finally, Roah returns in Act 3 as part of the quest to recruit Minsc. Here, she will only briefly act as a trader if she is sided against Nine-Finger Keene but has no new items.

 3  Lorroakan&#39;s Projection Has A Great Selection Of Spell Scrolls 
A Chance For Wizards To Learn High-Level Spells


 







Lorroakan&#39;s Projection is an illusory form of Lorroakan that can be found manning the counter of Sorcerous Sundries, if Rolan was killed earlier in the game. This magical trader has some fantastic items for spellcasters, including many high-level spell scrolls. Ones to keep an eye out for are Scroll of Chain Lightning, Scroll of Sunbeam, and Scroll of Disintegrate, all of which are very useful against Act 3 BG3 bosses.
If Rolan if alive, he will take the place of the projection. If Lorroakan is killed during the Nightsong quest, the projection will act as a merchant after Rolan takes over the store but will only sell scrolls. 






 2  Talli Offers Awesome Act 2 Gear 
The Harper Quartermaster Has A Great Selection
        

Quartermaster Talli is the Harper quartermaster and can be found directly opposite the Last Light Inn waypoint. Talli has some of the best armor and weapons in Act 2 as well as many dyes and accessories.

Try To Keep This Tiefling Smith Alive


 







Just like Roah Moonglow the teifling blacksmith Dammon is a merchant that can be found throughout Baldur’s Gate 3 in all three Acts. In each Act, Dammon adds to his stock, eventually selling some of the best armor found in Act 3. In Act 1, Dammon can be found in the Emerald Grove with the other tiefling refugees before moving on to the Last Light Inn for Act 2. Finally, in Act 3, Dammon is working at the Forge of the Nine, assuming he survived the previous Acts. Dammon is key to Karlach&#39;s personal quest and can also craft the Flawed Helldusk armor set, one of the best mid-game sets, making him easily the best merchant to seek out in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
