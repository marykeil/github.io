# Link Fighting Ganondorf In Zelda TOTK Isnt Even A Fair Fight


## SUMMARY 



  Ganondorf is at a weakened state in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, making him less formidable than he appears.   Ganondorf&#39;s defeat at the hands of Rauru left him severely weakened, and he seemingly hasn&#39;t fully recovered by the end of the game.   Link also has the advantages of wielding a Master Sword potentially more powerful than it&#39;s ever been, and frequently fighting Ganondorf alongside allies.

## Literature Review

As difficult an opponent as Ganondorf is in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, he is arguably not given a fair fight in the game.




Link’s battle against Ganondorf is the climax of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but it is a surprisingly uneven contest. When examining the circumstances in which the two cross swords, it becomes clear that they are not on equal terms, and that the fight itself is remarkably unfair. This gives an intriguing new perspective on the ending of Tears of the Kingdom, suggesting that events could have gone very differently under other circumstances.




As a figure commonly associated with the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf is far from an easy opponent to beat. However, with adequate preparation, Link is almost always able to overcome his fearsome nemesis. Link’s boundless courage, along with the variety of tools and abilities he gains over the course of an adventure, are more than enough to match Ganondorf’s near-overwhelming strength. The sole exception to this is the potential defeat during Ocarina of Time which leads to the Zelda series’ Downfall Timeline. However, while Link and Ganondorf’s various personal strengths can make them relatively evenly matched, this is arguably not the case in Tears of the Kingdom.

                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   


 Ganondorf Is Weaker In TOTK Than He First Seems 
          




As imposing as Ganondorf is, for most of TOTK it cannot be denied that he is in a weakened state. For example, aside from their encounter when the Master Sword shatters at the start of TOTK, Link and Ganondorf first battle each other through encounters with the latter’s Phantom Ganon form. While there are several places in Hyrule where Phantom Ganon can be found after defeating Gloom Hands, such as in the Depths below the Great Deku Tree, the most notable fight takes place in Hyrule Castle. Here, the fake Zelda is revealed to be Phantom Ganon in disguise, and a battle soon breaks out.

However, as this fight draws to a close and the Sages intervene, Phantom Ganon retreats rather than press on. Seeing this, Riju quickly reasons that, despite his superior demeanor, Ganondorf is far from being at full strength. Instead, this encounter demonstrates that Ganondorf’s withered, desiccated appearance is not merely cosmetic. His defeat at the hands of Rauru has obviously left him severely weakened, even countless years later, and consequently, he is no more capable of fighting Link and the Sages than any regular monster in Hyrule would be.




Of course, Ganondorf’s proclamations of eventual victory are far from being idle boasts. He is still the Demon King, after all, and appears to spend the majority of TOTK gathering his strength in the depths before the final battle. And when Link does confront him, Ganondorf undergoes a dramatic transformation with the aid of his Secret Stone, which restores his body, gaining a truly enormous health bar in the process. But even so, the fact that he is initially unable to fully live up to his own words suggests that Ganondorf is putting up a front. As Phantom Ganon, he is utterly outmatched by his enemies.



Phantom Ganon first appeared in Ocarina of Time, and has since gone on to become a recurring enemy for Link as a form of Ganondorf.






 Link Is In Better Health Than Ganondorf In TOTK’s Final Battle 
          




Moreover, although it may not initially seem like it, Ganondorf’s weakened status could even be a factor in the final battle with Link. During the initial stage of the fight, Ganondorf is clearly relying strongly on his Secret Stone to augment his own magic, but to no avail. Despite his health bar and impressive combat prowess, Ganondorf cannot overcome Link, especially once the Sages join the battle once again in order to fend off his Phantoms. In comparison to Link, who has no Secret Stone, the fact that Ganondorf needs to rely on his stolen, power-amplifying artifact again suggests that he isn’t as powerful as he would like others to believe.

This is further evidenced by the fact that Ganondorf also uses the Secret Stone to restore his body when confronted by Link, despite having plenty of time to do so beforehand. The implication is that either he was unable to muster the magic beforehand, or else he used the Stone to accelerate his healing process. It seems that Ganondorf has been caught, if not off guard, then at least before he was truly ready to conquer Hyrule; just as Riju realizes in Hyrule Castle, he is still not fully healed.




                  Is Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Still A 2023 GOTY Contender?   Tears of the Kingdom was a hit in early 2023, but the year has seen a series of games outdo the latest Zelda, leaving it as a forgettable footnote.   



 The Master Sword &amp; Link’s Allies Tilt Battles In The Hero’s Favor 
         

On top of this, the impact of the restored Master Sword in TOTK’s final battle cannot be understated. While Ganondorf has been sealed away by Rauru’s hand for millennia, the Master Sword has spent the same amount of time bathed in the Light Dragon’s potent magic. Even when the sword was brittle enough to shatter under the onslaught of malice, its fragments were still capable of cutting the Demon King. Now thoroughly reinforced, it is quite possible that the Master Sword is as strong as it has ever been in its entire history, if not even stronger.




With all this in mind, it is easy to see Link in a surprisingly superior position throughout his duel with Ganondorf. He has no Secret Stone, and yet he matches Ganondorf with nothing but the results of his own hard work and determination. When his allies join the fray, Ganondorf therefore begins to be overwhelmed. In that light, his choice of Draconfication is clearly more of a desperate ploy than anything else, sacrificing his mind in hopes of a victory he would not have the awareness to enjoy. Of course, even then, Link is able to triumph, this time with the help of Zelda in the form of the Light Dragon.

                  One Change Would Make Zelda: TOTK’s Ending So Much Better   Tears of the Kingdom has an incredibly emotional ending, but one story change could have made it better, if not much more heartbreaking.   

Despite all outward appearances, Ganondorf is left ill-prepared for a fight in many ways in TOTK. He relies heavily on his Secret Stone to make up for his weaknesses, even as Link faces him with an extremely damaging Master Sword. Similarly, Link being consistently supported by his allies in battle means that Ganondorf repeatedly faces multiple opponents. Physically weakened and constantly outnumbered, the King of Evil clearly struggles to have a fair fight in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. But considering how powerful Ganondorf is regardless, as well as the consequences of his victory, Link facing him with such unbalanced odds is undoubtedly for the best.
