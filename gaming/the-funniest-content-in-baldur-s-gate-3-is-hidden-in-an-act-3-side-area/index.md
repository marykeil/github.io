## Literature Review

Some of the best Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 content is off the beaten path, and taking some diversions can lead to memorable gags and exciting encounters.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has no shortage of humor, but some of the best jokes are often found outside the central content of the game. Dealing with mind flayer parasites and the threat of a mysterious god that could cause wide-scale catastrophe isn&#39;t exactly a lighthearted matter, so although there are plenty of quips here and there, the overall tone of the main story is often somber. Going off the beaten path can frequently end up revealing dark situations or tragic stories, but it also leads to a lot of general amusement that provides a nice change of pace.




Although every act of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 features a surplus of side material, Act 3 is where things kick into overdrive. The city of Baldur&#39;s Gate and its surroundings are much more densely populated than Druid Grove, the shadow-cursed lands, and any areas in between, and quests and secrets are lurking around virtually every corner. It can be tempting to rush through some of the earlier Act 3 content due to the seemingly urgent nature of the story, but letting the party take their time can pay significant dividends.

  


 The Circus Is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Funniest Side Area 
         




The whole schtick of a circus is the promise of various amusements, and the Circus of the Last Days delivers just that in Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Found soon after entering Rivington, an area just outside the city gates, the entrance to the circus is manned by the wood elf Klaus and a ghoul named Benji. Benji doesn&#39;t like the smell of the mind flayer parasite on the party, which can cause a minor roadblock to gaining admittance, but there are plenty of ways to make it into the Circus of the Last Days despite this initial rebuffing. Persuasion, intimidation, and bribery are all default options, while some classes like wizards can have specific extra avenues.

                  Why Act 3 Is The Worst Part Of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Despite the game&#39;s overall quality, the third act of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 suffers from a variety of issues, making it worse than the other two.   

Once inside, it quickly becomes obvious that Klaus wasn&#39;t lying about the circus&#39;s cavalcade of entertainment, as the engaging variety of NPCs to talk to within is hard to deny. Appropriately, it&#39;s a rather ragtag crew of fascinating misfits, so approaching any employee to start up a conversation has better odds of being memorable than stopping any passersby on the streets outside. There&#39;s also some danger involved in the circus visit, however, and it&#39;s best to save Dribbles the Clown for last to make sure that any interactions that might change after a certain shake-up can be experienced beforehand.






Dribbles is in the back corner of the circus, so it&#39;s easy to progress through in a logical order without accidentally skipping anything major.






 The Circus Has Memorable Items For Sale In BG3 
          

Surprisingly, the Circus of the Last Days might actually be one of the best shopping destinations in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Although clowns aren&#39;t lining up to distribute powerful weapons, there&#39;s a good mix of items to invest in that are funny, useful, or both. One particularly notable option is the statue that can be purchased to place in the party&#39;s camp, which takes on the appearance of the protagonist. It can be used either as a serious tribute or as an irreverent Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 memorialization â€” it&#39;s possible to have it render the character naked â€” and can also provide a renewable Bless buff that helps justify its exorbitant cost of 5,000 gold.




Another helpful but amusing choice is the clown face paint that can be bought from a mummy named Zara, which bedecks faces in a harlequin style and provides immunity to the Tasha&#39;s Hideous Laughter condition. As an extra trick, the makeup used to often persist after long rests, but that was ultimately a bug that Larian patched some time after the game&#39;s release. The endearing kobold Popper the Scavenger also has some great items to sell at the circus, including Dark Displacement Gloves that assist with throwing items, stealing, and swapping places with enemies.



 The Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Circus Features Fun Activities 
          

The Circus of the Last Days is also a great place to shake up the gameplay with a few unique activities. The biggest attraction for anyone who loves romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will likely be a quiz called Zethino&#39;s Love Test, which tasks players with answering questions about their romantic interest to see just how well they actually know them. It&#39;s also worthwhile even for those who don&#39;t have much interest in the game&#39;s relationships, as it surprisingly ties into a larger narrative arc in a reasonably minor but memorable way.




Akabi&#39;s Wheel of Wonders is a mini-game based on the typical wheel of prizes scenario, although the djinni Akabi is not entirely on the level when it comes to the odds of actually winning. The most amusing possibility attached to the wheel comes from deciding to provoke Akabi and refusing to back down, at which point the djinni will make good on some specific threats that lead to a hilarious result. There&#39;s also a way to get a powerful trident from him, adding another item to the roster of excellent acquisitions from the Circus of the Last Days.



 There&#39;s A Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Side Story At The Circus 
          

It&#39;s possible to miss out on a reasonably significant Act 3 story by skipping the Circus of the Last Days, which might be the most important reason to stop by. While most of the circus employees offer minor diversions or interesting goods, Dribbles the Clown puts on quite a show, to understate things significantly. Attending the clown&#39;s act hooks into one of the most interesting threads in Rivington, and it&#39;s more than enough reason to visit the circus by itself.




                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   

The Circus of the Last Days is one of the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 touches that really feels like tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons, fitting perfectly into the kind of unique and humorous side content that gets peppered throughout even the darkest campaigns. It&#39;s an especially fun diversion after the long march through the shadow-cursed lands, where any vibrant setting like the circus is fundamentally impossible. It might be easy to skip the circus in Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but doing so will miss out on an excellent bundle of memorable material that every party should get to experience.
