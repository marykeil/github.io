## Literature Review

Players can miss out on a secret cutscene in the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet if they do not use a certain special Pokémon in battle.




There is a short yet somewhat secret cutscene in the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The Epilogue, which is known as Mochi Mayhem, is an extra piece of content that allows players who have finished the Indigo Disk DLC to play through a special quest. The mission connects the story told in the Gen 10 games to the two expansions in The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero. It takes players back to the land of Kitakami with their friends from Paldea. However, upon arrival, they notice there is something strange with Carmine.

Later on, as they spend more time in Mossui Town, they notice Carmine is not the only character acting strangely and that most of the villagers have been affected as well. This is because these characters have fallen under the toxic influence of Pecharunt, a new dual Poison- and Ghost-type Mythical Pokémon in the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. After proceeding through most of the campaign, however, players can unlock a short and secret cutscene that makes perfect sense for the lore.

                  All Trainer Locations In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC   There are several new NPC trainers in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, including strong League Club members, hidden in the terrarium.   


 Ogerpon Has An Exclusive Reaction To Pecharunt In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Epilogue 
          




As originally noted by Joe Merrick on X and later confirmed by Screen Rant, there is a short cutscene involving Ogerpon. When players use the Legendary Grass-type Pokémon in the final boss fight against Pecharunt, Ogerpon will have an exclusive reaction, demonstrating what seems to be fury upon laying its eyes on the Mythical creature. It is a short and scripted scene that can easily be missed if players simply do not take Ogerpon into battle against Pecharaunt in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue and opt to use creatures that are stronger against it.



As a Grass-type Pokémon, Ogerpon is extremely weak against Pecharunt’s Poison-type moves and, even if properly trained, it can be knocked out with a single use of the Mythical Pokémon’s Malignant Chain.






 Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Epilogue’s Secret Cutscene Is Lore Appropriate 
          




The reaction that Ogerpon has upon seeing Pecharunt actually makes a lot of sense when considering the lore. The two are, even if in an unspoken manner, enemies to one another. Pecharunt is said to be the creature that granted the Loyal Three their Poison-type powers, represented by their Toxic Chain Abilities. This is also what enabled them to strike down Ogerpon’s former trainer, who lived with the ogre at the Dreaded Den, on the outskirts of Mossui Town in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC.

                  7 Pokémon Worth Using A Master Ball For In Indigo Disk   With a new abundance of Master Balls in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you can use the rare Poké Balls on multiple creatures.   

As expected, Ogerpon is not the only one to have a secret cutscene in the Epilogue: Mochi Mayhem. As was registered by the fan-made database Bulbapedia, Pecharunt will react angrily if the player uses any of the Loyal Three members against it. This also makes sense to the lore, as the wild Mythical Pokémon would be infuriated to see that one of its followers has been subdued and put against it in battle. These scripted and secret cutscenes do not alter the course of the story, but add some extra flavor for lore-savvy players in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
