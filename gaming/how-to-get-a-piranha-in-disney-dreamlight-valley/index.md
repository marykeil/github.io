## Literature Review

Among the new fish added into Disney Dreamlight Valley through the Rift in Time expansion, Piranha&#39;s are among some of the most rare to find.





Not only is the Piranha necessary to complete a few quests in the Rift in Time expansion, but several new recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley specifically require this fish, such as Piquant Piranha Soup. However, like every other fish in the game, it has specific requirements that must be met to catch it.




                  10 Coolest New Additions In Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s A Rift In Time Expansion   Disney Dreamlight Valleyâ€™s new expansion pass A Rift In Time brings a whole new land that doubles the size of the game with animals, story, and more.   


 Where To Catch Piranhas In Disney Dreamlight Valley 
         

First and foremost, to catch a Piranha, players must look for it in the right spot. Piranhas are native to The Lagoon and are found in the Wild Tangle area of Eternity Isle. This section is initially locked for players, the same way many of the other biomes were back in the main valley at the start of the game. Rather than needing Dreamlight to unlock these biomes, players will need Mist, the newest type of currency introduced as part of the expansion. Unlocking the area containing Piranhas will require 10,000 Mist.






Don&#39;t forget to utilize a companion with the fishing perk attached. This will allow for a chance to double the amount of fish caught, which can be essential for increasing your stock of some of the rare fish, like piranhas. Remember that the higher the friendship level, the better the odds of catching double. Therefore, bring along a villager with the fishing perk and maxed-out friendship for the best outcome.




Once at the fishing spot, players should seek out Orange Bubbles. As with all fishing in Disney Dreamlight Valley, White Bubbles indicate an average fish, Blue is slightly rarer, and Orange indicates the rarest type of fish. Unfortunately, the Piranha falls in that last category, meaning they will be spotted less often, so players may have to fish for a while before they get one. Once caught, they have several uses once caught, so be sure to stock up on as many as possible.

Piranha is used in various new recipes exclusive to the Rift in Time expansion. Though not recommended, due to their rarity and better-used alternatives, Piranhas can be sold or consumed as is. Consuming a Piranha will reward players with 1,900 Energy, while selling it at a vendor stall will provide 1,300 Gold Coins per Piranha. Although these are both significant numbers that seem high, these can be increased greatly by combining them with a few of Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s simple ingredients.
