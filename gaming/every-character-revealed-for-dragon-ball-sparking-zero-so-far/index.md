## Literature Review

Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is the continuation of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, and brings back its signature large roster of playable characters.




Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is the fourth entry in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series, adopting the Sparking! moniker that was previously reserved for the Japanese versions. First teased at DB Games Battle Hour 2023, the game&#39;s title wasn&#39;t revealed until a new trailer that premiered during The Game Awards 2023. Sparking! Zero is expected to bring back the fighting series&#39; signature, massive cast of playable characters, all taken from the Dragon Ball manga and anime.
The announcement trailer for Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero was short, but managed to reveal an impressive number of characters already. In just over a minute, 16 Dragon Ball characters were confirmed to be coming to the game, most of which come during a rapid montage after a reimagining of Goku and Vegeta&#39;s first, iconic clash. No true gameplay has been revealed, but as a continuation of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, there likely won&#39;t be many surprises for returning fans.









 








 16  Goku 
First Anime Appearance: The Secret Of The Dragon Balls


 







It&#39;s practically impossible to create a Dragon Ball video game without Goku, the series&#39; main character. Unsurprisingly, he&#39;s the first one to show up in Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&#39;s trailer (via Bandai Namco on YouTube), dressed in his iconic orange and blue sparring outfit. In the trailer, Goku is seen entering a state known as Super Saiyan Blue.

Kakarot&#39;s epic clashes capture the flair and intensity of the show but its open world drops the ball due to underwhelming mission design and variety.








 15  Vegeta 
First Anime Appearance: Gohan&#39;s Rage


 







Goku&#39;s rival and foil, Vegeta, the prince of Saiyans, appears right alongside Goku in the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero trailer. He, too, manages to achieve Super Saiyan Blue status, matching Goku as they clash in the desert, destroying plateaus as they go.





 14  Frieza 
First Anime Appearance: Brood Of Evil


 







Responsible for the destruction of the planet Namek, Frieza is one of Dragon Ball&#39;s most iconic villains. He&#39;s seen recreating this violent deed in the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero trailer, perhaps confirmation that the ability to destory planets mid-fight is returning from Budokai Tenkaichi 3.
            
 
 Dragon Ball: The Breakers Review - Standard Survival And Not Much Else 
Dragon Ball: The Breakers tries to shake up the usual DB gaming formula by putting players in an asymmetrical survival title, with mixed results. 








 13  Broly 
First Anime Film Appearance: Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan


 







Broly is perhaps the most famous Saiyan villain in Dragon Ball, but is often shown without the armor typically associated with the race. This is usually expained by Broly having no affiliation with Frieza, whom many Saiyans served after his destruction of their home planet. Broly still possesses Battle Armor, however, and he&#39;s seen wearing the green and black outfit in Sparking! Zero.







 12  Piccolo 
First Anime Appearance: Lost And Found
        

A Namekian and second father figure to Gohan, Piccolo is one of many villains who eventually become heroes in Dragon Ball. He was a fierce rival of Goku in the final Dragon Ball saga, but quickly joined the Saiyan&#39;s side at the beginning of Dragon Ball Z.





 11  Krillin 
First Anime Appearance: Goku&#39;s Rival
        

Krillin is Goku&#39;s best friend, having trained together under Master Roshi. He&#39;s one of Earth&#39;s greatest fighters, but is still no match for many of the series&#39; major villains. Krillin is shown briefly in the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero trailer performing his signature move, Destructo Disc.





 10  Tien 
First Anime Appearance: The Rampage Of InoShika-Cho
        

Tien Shinhan is another member of the Z Fighters, and, like Krillin, is a notable martial artist among Earthlings, but is typically outclassed by the franchise&#39;s cosmic characters. Tien and his defining feature, a third eye, appear in the trailer, but his best friend and near-constant companion, Chiaotzu, does not.





 9  Yamcha 
First Anime Appearance: Yamcha The Desert Bandit
        

Yamcha is yet another character who began his Dragon Ball tenure as a villain, but quickly became one of the series&#39; core characters and a reliable Z Figther. Like Tien, Yamcha is shown in the trailer without his best friend, a shape-shifter named Puar.





 8  Trunks 
First Anime Appearance: The Androids Appear


 







Two versions of Trunks appear in Sparking! Zero&#39;s trailer, his default adult form wearing Saiyan armor, and the alternate timeline version of him known as Future Trunks. In the latter, seemingly inspired by his Dragon Ball Super appearance, he wears a Capsule Corporation jacket and is brandishing a sword.





 7  Android 17 
First Anime Appearance: Nightmare Comes True
        

Like Future Trunks, Android 17 dons his Dragon Ball Super outfit in the Sparking! Zero trailer. 17 was created by Dr. Gero, and serves as a villain for part of Dragon Ball Z&#39;s Androids Saga, but is yet another character who turns the page and becomes well-acquainted with the Dragon Team.





 6  Android 18 
First Anime Appearance: Nightmare Comes True
        

The twin sister of Android 17, Android 18&#39;s introduction to the franchise is much the same, as the two are largely inseparable during the Androids Saga. Her brief appearance in the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero trailer (in which she seems to be throwing Vegeta over her shoulder) has her wearing her original DBZ outfit. After her turn from villainy, 17 marries Krillin, and the two have a daughter, Marron.





 5  Cell 
First Anime Appearance: The Reunion
        

Cell is the ultimate villain during the Androids Saga, and Gero&#39;s most powerful creation. Cell absorbs other lifeforms as well as other androids to transition between a number of forms. Perfect Cell appears in the game&#39;s trailer, though if previous Budokai Tenkaichi games are any indication, his other forms may be playable too.





 4  Mr. Satan 
First Anime Appearance: Dende&#39;s Dragon
        

Mr. Satan is a rich and famous martial artist, but won his glory while the Z Fighters were busy addressing other threats â€“ namely Frieza on Namek, and the androids prior to the Cell Games. Mr. Satan&#39;s bravado is clearly on display in the Sparking! Zero trailer, as is his most recognizable outfit, albeit without the cape he&#39;s known to wear.





 3  Majin Buu 
First Anime Appearance: Buu Is Hatched
        

Majin Buu is the primary antagonist of Dragon Ball Z&#39;s Majin Buu Saga, but later becomes an ally to the Z Fighters as Innocent Buu, the form seen in Sparking! Zero. Like Cell, Buu has many forms, and because of his prominence in the anime, all these forms are likely to appear in the game.





 2  Bergamo 
First Anime Appearance: Even The Universes&#39; Gods Are Appalled?! The Lose-And Perish Tournament Of Power
        

Bergamo is a humanoid wolf that first appears during Dragon Ball Super. Hailing from Universe 9, Bergamo comes from a race of humanoid wolves, and is a member of the Trio of Danger. Because of his appearance in Sparking! Zero&#39;s trailer, it&#39;s likely that the trio&#39;s two other members, Lavender and Basil, will appear as well.





 1  Jiren 
First Anime Appearance: The Universes Go Into Action - Each With Their Own Motives
        

Like Bergamo, Jiren is a relatively recent addition to the franchise, debuting in Dragon Ball Super. As a member of the Pride Troopers, who all share the same red-and-black outfit and white gloves, Jiren&#39;s appearance could signal a number off characters coming to Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero. Jiren, however, remains the only confirmed Pride Trooper, and is the most notable, being on of the franchise&#39;s most powerful fighters in existence.
