## Literature Review

A new Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Easter egg may be hinting at the arrival of another Marvel hero in some future content, potentially the game&#39;s story DLC.




A Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Easter egg may be hinting at some unexpected DLC content for the game. While many had expected story DLC for Insomniac Games&#39; acclaimed superhero sequel, much like The City That Never Sleeps DLC for the first, most of the theories around its content revolved around continuing a story set up in one of the title&#39;s side missions, but this may not be the case.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2]

It&#39;s long been established that other Marvel superheroes exist in Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe. Back in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, Peter would speculate about where the Avengers were when swinging past Avengers Tower, and there were Easter Eggs for other heroes such as Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, and more across the series.

  


 Could Daredevil Be In Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC? 
          

Caboose shared a clip of a new Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Easter egg on X which could allude to another Marvel hero: Daredevil. The footage showed a hidden room on the Upper West Side. The room could be seen through a barred window beneath a massive red flag and had various swords and other bladed weapons alongside a library of books. By jumping over the building, he could access the inside of a book store which had an entrance to the room hidden behind a bookcase.





 

Caboose speculated that this could be Insomniac setting up The Hand, a secret Ninja clan and one of Daredevil&#39;s main adversaries. Although the symbols on the walls don&#39;t align with The Hand&#39;s in the comics, this could be a redesign for Insomniac&#39;s universe, as it doesn&#39;t match the game&#39;s pre-existing factions&#39; emblems, such as The Flame. If The Hand did appear in New York though, it&#39;s highly likely that Daredevil would be on hand to fight them.

During a recent episode of IGN&#39;s Beyond podcast, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s director Brian Intihar addressed the Easter eggs for Daredevil across the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games. In the first game, the hero&#39;s lawyer firm Nelson and Murdock had a sign outside its office building, but by Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, this had been removed with an eviction notice. When asked about the whereabouts of the character, Intihar said that &#34;they&#39;re fine&#34;, but to &#34;stay tuned&#34;, teasing some kind of Daredevil appearance in Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe.






A couple of weeks after Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s launch, the Nelson and Murdock sign had been added back into the game in a patch.




                  How Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Sets Up Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3&#39;s Story &amp; Villains   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has set up plenty of plot points for a future entry in the series, from returning villains to potential new superheroes.    



 Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe Is Growing 
          

In the same podcast episode, Intihar confirmed that the upcoming Marvel&#39;s Wolverine game would share the same universe as the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games. This had already been teased in the comics and the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse movie, where Insomniac&#39;s version of Peter Parker had a cameo with the caption &#34;Insomniac Spider-Man of Earth-1048&#34; above his head. This indicates that while Marvel had previously stated that its games wouldn&#39;t crossover, this may not be the case for those being developed by Insomniac.




The Hand has also a history with Wolverine in the comics, with the mutant even being brainwashed and serving as one of the group&#39;s assassins at one point in Enemy of the State. Therefore, it&#39;s possible that neither Spider-Man nor Daredevil could be facing the dangerous clan, and that it may appear in Marvel&#39;s Wolverine instead, as very little has been confirmed about the M-Rated game&#39;s story or location since its announcement trailer showing Logan sitting a bar in the aftermath of a brawl.



Marvel&#39;s Wolverine&#39;s announcement trailer teased Madripoor, a popular location for those outside the law in the Marvel Universe, but there has been no confirmation that the game will take place there.




Alternatively, with Insomniac&#39;s growing universe, the room could belong to an entirely different group, such as the Illuminati. The logo on the wall inside could resemble an eye with a Vishanti-esque seal as its pupil. If so, it could actually be a reference to Doctor Strange, a character who was already referenced in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s Black Cat missions. One thing&#39;s for certain, this room is clearly a nod to some kind of Marvel character, and fans are eager to see the Spider-Men team up with some of their superhero peers as Insomniac&#39;s Marvel universe expands.
