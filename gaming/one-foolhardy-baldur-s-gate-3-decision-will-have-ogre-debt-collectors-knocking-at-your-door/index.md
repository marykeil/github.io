## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 includes a variety of consequences for immoral actions, and one choice can lead to ogre debt collectors coming after your party.




In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, making deals with devils is repeatedly emphasized to be a bad decision, and that the consequences can&#39;t be avoided. However, devils aren&#39;t the only creatures that the party can make deals with in BG3. And just like dealing with devils, dealing with other creatures can also have unexpected or surprising consequences, such as debt collectors showing up to demand payment from the party.




While some NPCs are willing to help the party without receiving anything in return, that isn&#39;t true in all cases. Some allies have to be bought, bribed, or threatened to receive their help, such as Balthazar in Act 2, who gives the party the aid of a flesh golem in exchange for helping him. And since there&#39;s the option to make deals with NPCs in exchange for help, it&#39;s also possible to scam NPCs and face the consequences that arise for doing so.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Recruiting Lump And His Ogres For Help 
          

In Act 1, the party can find a trio of ogres in the Blighted Village. Depending on how violent of an approach is being taken during that playthrough, the default response might be to kill the ogres, loot them, and continue to the Goblin Camp. This isn&#39;t a bad option, as it gives the party Lump&#39;s headpiece, which increases the intelligence of the person wearing it to 17. However, it&#39;s also possible to recruit the ogres&#39; help in a future battle, as a successful negotiation with Lump will lead to him giving the party an ogre horn that they can use to summon the ogres to fight with them.




                  10 Deadliest Decisions You Can Make In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Baldur’s Gate 3 lets you play as morally good or evil as you want, but it can be hard to know which choices result in deadly consequences.   

There are a few ways to go about negotiating with the ogres for their help. First, it&#39;s possible to offer them 500 gold upfront to abandon the Absolute and help the party instead. A successful Deception check with a DC of 10 convinces them that they&#39;ll receive 1,000 gold after they fight for the party. Or there&#39;s the option of using Persuasion, and a successful check with a DC of 20 can get the help of the ogres simply so they can have the joy of feasting on slain enemies. And finally, a barbarian or paladin can Intimidate the ogres with a DC of 20 to fight in exchange for not being killed by the party.



 Scamming Lump &amp; His Friends 
          




The easiest options for getting Lump and his friends working for the party are to give them the 500 gold they requested, or use Deception, because it has the lowest DC of the options. These result in the party receiving the Ogre Horn, which can be used in Act 1 at any point. After Act 1, the ogres are considered too far away to be summoned by the horn, meaning their help can&#39;t be used again. To scam Lump and his friends, the party needs to first use Deception, saying that the ogres will receive 1,000 gold after they fight for the group.

Next, the party needs to use the horn to summon the ogres while in Act 1, but not while in the Underdark or Mountain Pass. While those areas are technically still in Act 1, they&#39;re too far away for summoning the ogres. After bringing in the ogres to fight, they request the 1,000 gold that had been promised in exchange for their help. However, the party can convince the ogres that their help will be needed again, and that they&#39;ll be paid after the next battle they fight in. Then, the party can just not summon them a second time to avoid paying the 1,000 gold. Except, Lump isn&#39;t happy about losing out on that money.






A message that displays when entering the Mountain Pass makes it seem like the party cannot return to Act 1; however, this is not the case – both the Underdark and the Mountain Pass can be explored prior to Act 2.






 Lump&#39;s Revenge For Being Scammed 
          

It seems like, after leaving Act 1 behind, that the ogres would never reappear, and that the debt owed to them would be forgotten or simply considered a loss. However, developer Larian Studios prepared for this and included a scene where the ogres show up in Act 2 if they were scammed in Act 1. During a long rest, Lump and his friends appear and wake up the party, demanding the gold that they were promised. It&#39;s interesting that the ogres are willing to follow the party that far, but if the party tries to use the horn to get their help in Act 2, they&#39;re still considered too far away, despite the fact that they&#39;re close enough to find the group.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Just Made One Major Choice Way Less Appealing   Patch 5 added a secret epilogue for Lae’zel among its many changes, and it makes a major choice at the end of Act 1 worth skipping completely.   

Unfortunately for Lump and his friends, they haven&#39;t leveled since the party first came across them, meaning they&#39;re still level four if they show up in Act 2. As such, it&#39;s even easier for the party to defeat the ogres when they show up as debt collectors than it is to kill them when first meeting them in the Blighted Village. Additionally, Lump&#39;s headband can be taken after defeating him in Act 2, just like in Act 1, meaning that a member of the party can receive an intelligence boost.



 Scamming Lump Is The Best Option 
         

Funny enough, this makes scamming Lump the best option because it provides the most benefits, although some of those benefits require a bit of patience to receive. Not only does the party get the help of a group of ogres to help them fight for free, but then the party can later pick up the Warped Headband of Intellect to use after killing the ogres when they try to become debt collectors, which would normally be sacrificed in exchange for the help of the ogres. In the end, scamming Lump is the most beneficial and lets the party get his headband and his help. And all the party has to do is fight some fourth-level ogres in Act 2.




There are times in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 where it feels like the developers have thought of everything and included consequences for any actions the party might take. The result makes it unsurprising that Larian Studios took home several wins at The Game Awards 2023, including Game of the Year. Even though Tav and their companions have spent thousands of hours exploring Faerûn across multiple playthroughs, it&#39;s unlikely that everything included and hidden behind specific choice combinations has yet to be found in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
