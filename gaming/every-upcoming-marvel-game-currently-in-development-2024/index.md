## Literature Review

Including the imminent arrival of Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, Marvel gaming fans can look forward to multiple titles hitting shelves in the coming years.




Marvel fans have a lot of video games to look forward to in the future, with Marvel&#39;s Blade, Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, and a Black Panther game serving as three of the biggest confirmed titles so far. Information on most upcoming titles is fairly slim, although they&#39;ve all been teased in some form or another. The fluctuating nature of game development means that some of these projects could still be years away, but fans should see some satisfaction in the near future. Most of the games announced have showcased which heroes will lead their adventures, except for one title that&#39;s known to be in development without any specific information yet revealed.
Following the release of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man in 2018, Marvel games have experienced a resurgence. Insomniac Games followed up its first Spider-Man title with a spin-off, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, in 2020, while Square-Enix published Marvel&#39;s Avengers and Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy to mixed results. The 2023 arrival of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 saw another big success in both critical and audience reception, continuing a strong streak for Insomniac. At the moment, six games based on Marvel superheroes are known to be in the works, coming from Insomniac Games, EA, Skydance New Media, and Arkane Lyon.
            
 
 &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review 
Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.












 








 Marvel&#39;s Blade 
Arkane Lyon


 







Marvel&#39;s Blade is the most recently announced Marvel video game, revealed at the 2023 Game Awards ceremony with a teaser trailer that showed the hero getting a shave at the barber shop. After a siren goes off, he puts on his glasses, bares his fangs, and draws his blade before the title card drops. This won&#39;t be the first video game to star the hero, as the Wesley Snipes films received tie-in games (proper console titles for the first two and a mobile entry for the third), but it will be the first to hit the market in two decades or more by the time of its release.
            
 
 Is Marvel&#39;s Blade Set In The Same Universe As Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man &amp; Wolverine? 
Marvel&#39;s Blade is the perfect follow-up to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#39;s Wolverine — that is if the game is actually a follow-up at all.



Marvel&#39;s Blade is being developed by Arkane Lyon, the studio responsible for games like Dishonored 2 and Deathloop. It&#39;s likely that the Paris setting will feature at least some helping of the immersive sim touches that Arkane&#39;s games are known for, although this outing ditches the first-person tradition for third-person action. There&#39;s no release date for Marvel&#39;s Blade yet, and although the teaser boasts somewhat stylized animation that is likely to be represented in the game, no actual footage has been shown.





 Marvel&#39;s Wolverine 
Insomniac Games
        

Announced at the same time as Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 during 2021&#39;s PlayStation Showcase, Marvel&#39;s Wolverine will also be developed by Insomniac Games and released exclusively on the PlayStation 5. Details regarding the title are incredibly slim, as only one teaser trailer has been shown. Excitingly, though, Insomniac has revealed that the Wolverine game will be set in the same universe as Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. Whether Peter Parker and Miles Morales show up in the game remains to be seen, but Wolverine is a compelling enough character to carry the experience either way.
The continuity hasn&#39;t linked in any significant way yet, as Wolverine didn&#39;t appear in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 thanks to the development teams focusing on their individual projects. 

No release date or year has been revealed for Marvel&#39;s Wolverine. A focus on Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 kept the spotlight off of Marvel&#39;s Wolverine in 2023, so fans might finally be able to learn more about this project in development in 2024. Wolverine&#39;s announcement sets up the potential for a Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man game universe to rival the MCU as long as Insomniac can continue to build on the solid foundation of the Spider-Man experiences released so far.
            
 
 Marvel&#39;s Wolverine Game&#39;s Release Date Rumor Is Only Possible For One Reason 
Marvel&#39;s Wolverine might not be too long in coming, which would seem like a pipe dream if not for some key evidence that supports the idea.








 Untitled Iron Man Game 
Motive Studio
        

The Marvel Cinematic Universe films catapulted Iron Man to a position as one of the most globally recognized Marvel superheroes, and with only a couple of minor tie-in games and a VR experience so far, a major AAA venture has always seemed inevitable. EA subsidiary Motive Studio, the team behind Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake, is working on the upcoming project under the leadership of Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy producer Olivier Proulx. The Iron Man game is set to feature an original story, and tapping into the interesting character of Tony Stark and bringing his high-tech suits to life could make for a compelling experience.





 Untitled Black Panther Game 
Cliffhanger Games
        

Another major project from EA is a recently announced open-world Black Panther game, intended to bring the rich environment of Wakanda to life for players. While the comics, films, and even segments of previous games have presented compelling looks at T&#39;Challa&#39;s home, being able to thoroughly explore it first-hand could provide a new level of interactivity and immersion. The Black Panther game is being developed by the newly formed Cliffhanger Games studio, led by a former studio head of Monolith Productions, which created games like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and F.E.A.R. 





 Untitled Ensemble Marvel Game 
Skydance New Media
        

Former Uncharted director Amy Hennig is leading a story-driven Marvel game at Skydance New Media, which takes an ensemble cast through a story set during World War 2. Like the upcoming Black Panther game, the Skydance New Media title promises a Wakanda setting alongside a historical Paris. T&#39;Challa&#39;s ancestor Azzuri takes on the Black Panther mantle alongside Steve Rogers as Captain America, with side characters Gabriel Jones and Nanali rounding out an ensemble. Gameplay for the title has yet to be revealed, but it could be a compelling experience for fans interested in a pulp history diversion from the more common contemporary setting of Marvel properties.





 Untitled EA Marvel Game 
Electronic Arts
        

EA isn&#39;t hitting the brakes on Marvel games anytime soon, with at least one more title in development beyond the Iron Man and Black Panther games. There&#39;s no word yet on what superhero or team the game will follow, nor what studio under EA&#39;s umbrella might be involved with development. Under the circumstances, it&#39;s unlikely that this game will see release before EA&#39;s announced titles unless it goes for a smaller scale with a less central hero. The lack of information for this and other titles might be frustrating for now, but the announcement of Marvel&#39;s Blade and the overall variety of experiences in development promises an exciting future.
