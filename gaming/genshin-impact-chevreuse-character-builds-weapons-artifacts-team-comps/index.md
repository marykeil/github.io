## Literature Review

Building Chevreuse appropriately is the best way of optimizing her as a support and healer unit in her team comps. There is a catch, however.





She can be added to any regular team comp but works particularly well with parties that rely on Overloaded Elemental Reactions. This is because she grants a Pyro and Electro DMG buff to all party members when she fires an Overcharged Ball with her Elemental Skill – this special ammunition can be obtained from triggering Overloaded with the team comp. When she is paired with a party of at least one Electro and one Pyro character (outside Chevreuse herself), Overloaded reactions will decrease enemies’ Electro and Pyro resistances. Her Skill can also heal party members, which makes her a complete support unit.

 Best Weapons For Chevreuse 
          

Although most of her skill set revolves around the firing of her musket via her Elemental Skill, Chevreuse’s weapon of choice is a polearm – and she uses it with her Normal and Charged Attacks. Before choosing a weapon, it is important to understand that Chevreuse’s healing and buffs both scale off her Max HP stat, so that is what you will need to search for when building her. As a support unit, she can also operate well with Energy Recharge, though that should be secondary. While Hu Tao’s signature 5-star polearm in Genshin Impact, Staff of Homa, may seem like the best choice for her, it is not.




The very useful offensive characteristics of the 5-star weapon would ultimately be wasted on Chevreuse as she does not stay on the field and does not serve to attack. Additionally, the 20% HP boost provided by the Staff of Homa is suboptimal compared to other polearms. Currently, the best weapon for Chevreuse is a tie between Rightful Reward and Black Tassel. The former is a 4-star F2P (free-to-play) weapon that can be crafted in Genshin Impact and can offer a boost to HP (27.6% at level 90). Rightful Reward can also restore 8 Energy when the user is healed. It also provides a decent base attack (565 at level 90).

On the other hand, Black Tassel is a 3-star polearm with a pitiful base attack stat (354 at level 90). However, it can provide an immense HP boost (46.9% at level 90), making the process of building Chevreuse much easier, especially when it comes to increasing her HP for healing and buffs. If you intend on occasionally using Chevreuse offensively, then Rightful Reward is the way to go, but if you want to make a fully-fledged support and healer unit out of her, then Black Tassel is the best weapon for her.






As lower-grade and even F2P weapons, it is much easier to max out the Refinement levels on both Rightful Reward and Black Tassel when compared to Staff of Homa.




The table below lists the best builds for Chevreuse in Genshin Impact, including weapons, Artifact, stats, and more:

 Chevreuse&#39;s Best Build In Genshin Impact   Weapon    Rightful Reward (Best F2P 4-star for HP)   Black Tassel (3-star with best HP sub-stat)   The Catch (F2P 4-star for Energy Recharge)   Favonius Lance (4-star for Energy Recharge)      Artifact    Noblesse Oblige (4 pieces - buffer Chevreuse)   Ocean-Hued Clam (4 pieces - healer Chevreuse)      Stat Priority    HP   Energy Recharge   Elemental Mastery (optional sub-stat)      Skill Priority    Elemental Skill   Elemental Burst   Normal Attack      



Alternatively, if you’ve reached a satisfactory amount of HP for Chevreuse via her Artifacts, you can opt to equip her with a weapon that will help with other supporting abilities. The Catch and Favonius Lance are two polearms that can boost Energy Recharge, which can come in handy to keep Elemental Bursts charged. Of course, boosting her HP is still of the utmost priority, but if Chevreuse’s healing and buffs are at their limit in Genshin Impact, you can ease off a bit and make her more useful elsewhere.






 Best Team Comps For Chevreuse 
         

When picking party members for Chevreuse to accompany, you should be considering Overloaded Elemental Reactions at the core of the group dynamic. As such, it is best to use a Pyro DPS and an Electro sub-DPS or an Electro main DPS and a Pyro sub-DPS. What you need to do is to constantly trigger Overloaded reactions so that Chevreuse can pick up her Overcharged Ball for her special Elemental Skill, which will then heal and buff the rest of the team’s Pyro and Electro attacks. There are plenty of good Genshin Impact characters to choose from.

One of the best teams is built on a reliant on-field Pyro main DPS, such as Yoimiya, Lyney, or Hu Tao, and using an off-field Electro sub-DPS like Raiden Shogun or Yae Miko. You can also use Cyno or Raiden Shogun as the main DPS and then use Xiangling, Thoma, or Dehya as the Pyro sub-DPS. The last slot will depend on your needs. If Chevreuse is not healing enough, you can always use Bennett or Kuki Shinobu to help. If you need extra protection, you can use a shielder like Zhongli and, if you want to spread elements more abundantly, Kazuha is always a good pick in Genshin Impact.




The table below lists a few team comp suggestions into which Chevreuse can be inserted:

 Chevreuse&#39;s Best Team Comps In Genshin Impact   Overloaded Team Comp    Chevreuse (Support or Healer)   Raiden Shogun (Sub-DPS)   Yoimiya, Lyney, or Hu Tao (Main DPS)   Bennett (Healer), Kazuha (Support), or Zhongli (Shielder)      F2P Team Comp    Chevreuse (Support or Healer)   Fischl (Support and Sub-DPS)   Xiangling (Sub-DPS)   Lisa (Main DPS)      



Even though the best team comps for Chevreuse are limited to those that trigger Overloaded since her entire kit revolves around that Elemental Reaction, you do have a lot of leeway when building these teams. There are several DPS and sub-DPS with Pyro or Electro affinity that can benefit from Chevreuse’s buffs and healing in Genshin Impact.



 Best Artifacts, Stats, &amp; Skill Priority For Chevreuse 
          

When it comes to the Artifacts equipped by Chevreuse, there are two distinct options based on what you want her to do. As a support buffer unit, four pieces of the Noblesse Oblige set should be your choice. The two-piece bonus grants a 20% bonus to Chevreuse’s Elemental Burst DMG, which is quite disposable, but the four-piece bonus grants all party members a 20% boost to ATK after Chevreuse uses her Burst. The effect lasts for 12 seconds. This can optimize Chevreuse as a support unit for the team in Genshin Impact.




If you intend on using Chevreuse as a healer, then you will want to give her four pieces of the Ocean-Hued Clam set. The two-piece bonus grants her a 15% Healing Bonus. The four-piece bonus creates a bubble that deals damage based on the healing provided. Regardless of the role Chevreuse is occupying and the set you chose, the stats you want to search for when farming Artifacts in Genshin Impact are HP and Energy Recharge. A useful sub-stat is Elemental Mastery, but HP should be the highest priority, followed by Energy Recharge.

After you finish ascending Chevreuse, you should start leveling up her Talents. The first order of business is getting Chevreuse’s Elemental Skill to the maximum level. That is the most useful Talent in her kit, as it both heals and provides buffs – which are the core of her entire gameplay. The second talent to level is her Elemental Burst, as it can aid with some Pyro DMG whenever it is available. The last priority should be her Normal Attack. If you do not have the resources, there is no rush to upgrade her Normal Attacks – she should not be using these attacks in Genshin Impact.




Building Chevreuse is extremely easy, especially considering that both her different builds scale off the same stat. There are not too many fantastic weapon options for her to choose from, but the best ones in the game for her needs are easily obtainable. Even though it may seem restraining to have her limited to Overloaded teams, the buffs she provides can kit in perfectly with such a party and make your adventures through Genshin Impact much easier.
