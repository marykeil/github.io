## Literature Review

With no direction from the Pokédex, catching a Minior in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC can be an especially hard undertaking.





Minior are especially hard to locate Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC because the Pokédex does not specify where to look for them. Furthermore, Minior is a Rock-type Pokémon that comes in eight different colors, with some of the variants, such as Black (Shiny) being especially rare. Naturally, every trainer wants to flex their muscles by catching every color of Minior. While this is still difficult, the good news is that catching a Minior is more straightforward than obtaining some of the other rare Pokémon, such as how to catch Articuno.






Minior can be found in eight different colors. These include Red, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Blue, Light Blue, Green, and Black (Shiny). However, you won&#39;t know the color of the Minior until you break its outer shell (get its HP to below half) while fighting them.
