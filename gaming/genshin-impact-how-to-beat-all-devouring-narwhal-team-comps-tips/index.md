## Literature Review

Learn how to unlock the All-Devouring Narwhal weekly boss fight in Genshin Impact and utilize strategies to beat it with much less effort.





The All-Devouring Narwhal is the weekly boss addition that helps conclude the first portion of the main story arc told in Fontaine. This boss was one of the new features that came with the release of Genshin Impact 4.2. This is the same update that introduced Furina and Charlotte as playable characters and brought forth a series of important narrative events that altered the story of the region. To gain access to the potential rewards it drops, you have to unlock the boss fight and be able to beat the All-Devouring Narwhal – and this is where strategies and even recommended team comps come in handy.

 How To Unlock The All-Devouring Narwhal Boss Fight 
          

The first order of business is unlocking the All-Devouring Narwhal boss fight itself. There are now two distinct ways of doing so. The first of them is through natural progression. As a weekly boss in Genshin Impact, the All-Devouring Narwhal’s encounter is unlocked by progressing through the main storyline. A simplified version of the boss fight happens during &#34;The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur&#34; mission in Chapter IV: Act V of the Archon Quests. In essence, catching up with the story and beating the boss during the story will unlock the encounter, allowing you to face it normally in exchange for a challenge and limited rewards.




Luckily, HoYoverse has implemented a quality-of-life update that allows you to face the All-Devouring Narwhal without necessarily getting up to speed with the main campaign. In a new feature added in Version 4.2, weekly boss fights can now be triggered through a quick-start mechanism. The only requirement is that you are Adventure Rank (AR) 40 or above in Genshin Impact. This means that, if you are still stuck progressing through Inazuma’s storyline, for instance, but have reached AR 40, you can use the new system optimization resource to face the All-Devouring Narwhal as a weekly boss and reap the items it potentially drops.



 Strategies &amp; Tips To Beat All-Devouring Narwhal Boss 
          

While most of the confrontation against the All-Devouring Narwhal is quite straightforward, there are a few strategies that you can employ when facing the boss in Genshin Impact. The Narwhal can be an annoying opponent, as it navigates the arena and hides underneath the surface. As such, it is recommended that you hold your most powerful attacks until the creature is completely above the surface and is visibly staying there for a while – the first portion of the fight sees the boss move around a lot, so be wary not to waste Bursts. Another important detail is to bring Pneuma and Ousia characters.






Using an archer, especially those that thrive on Charged Attacks, can really help during the early stages of the fight. Characters like Ganyu and Lyney in Genshin Impact are great combatants here.




During this stage, you have to dodge its attacks – a particularly dangerous attack sees the boss creating several pillars of light across the arena. These pillars are telegraphed by glowing circles on the ground, and you simply need to move around and step out of potentially dangerous zones. Your attacks will help build up the All-Devouring Narwhal’s rage meter in Genshin Impact. When it is full, you will have grabbed the attention of the boss. If the rage meter is not filled in time, the All-Devouring Narwhal will create the Eye of the Maelstrom, an orb that needs to be destroyed to effectively attract the attention of the boss.



The Eye of the Maelstrom is susceptible to Pneuma and Ousia attacks, which make destroying it all the easier.







After the All-Devouring Narwhal is enraged, it will swallow you. This initiates the second part of the fight in Genshin Impact, against a humanoid creature called the Dark Shadow. This opponent is very strong and can be a risk. Nevertheless, the goal is to either clear its HP bar or use Pneuma and Ousia to break the shield bar it possesses. The best way of dealing with it is by using Pneuma and Ousia attacks against both the opponent and the orb-like attack it summons. Once either of its bars is cleared, you will return to the arena with the All-Devouring Narwhal, and it will collapse.



It is possible to deal with the Pneuma and Ousia mechanics of the fight without actually using characters that are aligned to the Arkhe system. However, it may take longer.




This is a prime opportunity to use all of your strongest attacks against the All-Devouring Narwhal in Genshin Impact. If you have a solid team comp with a large amount of DPS, this can be where you end the fight. If you are unable to clear the boss’ HP bar, it will recover and start the first part of the second stage. Most of its attacks will remain the same but, occasionally, it will jump at your position for AoE (area of effect) damage and surrounding areas will crack – these cracks are telegraphing more AoE attacks, so step into zones that are clear after dodging its dive.




After enraging it again, the All-Devouring Narwhal will swallow you again in Genshin Impact, initiating the second part of the second stage against the Dark Shadow. At this point, you will want to rinse and repeat everything you have been doing so far – disrupting attacks with Pneuma and Ousia to leave opponents vulnerable and dealing as much damage as possible when the Narwhal is on the ground. This process can be repeated until the boss is defeated.



If you are swallowed twice by the All-Devouring Narwhal in a single fight, you will unlock the The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy Achievement, which in turn rewards you with 10x Primogems.






 Best Team Comps To Use Against All-Devouring Narwhal 
         

This can be a gruesome fight in Genshin Impact, so having the proper team comp with you can make things easier. The key here is using Pneuma and Ousia characters to disrupt the mechanics used by the All-Devouring Narwhal and the Dark Shadow. As such, using a Fontainian DPS like Lyney can make things progress easier. In addition to that, you will want reliable protection from the powerful attacks the opponents employ, so using Zhongli and a consistent healer like Bennett can help you stay safe.






The main elements you want to avoid using in the All-Devouring Narwhal fight are Electro and Hydro. The boss and the Dark Shadow are especially resistant to these elements.




The table below lists a few team comp suggestions to use when facing the All-Devouring Narwhal:

 F2P Team Comp For All-Devouring Narwhal   Main DPS    Amber      Sub-DPS    Hydro Traveler      Support    Kaeya or Collei      Healer    Bennett      Best Team Comp For All-Devouring Narwhal   Main DPS    Lyney      Support / Sub-DPS    Kazuha, Lynette, or Xiangling      Shielder    Zhongli      Healer    Bennett      






You can get creative when building a team comp for the All-Devouring Narwhal boss fight in Genshin Impact. Even if the opponents are resistant to Hydro and Electro, that should not impede you from using characters like Furina or the Hydro Traveler as sources of Pneuma and Ousia damage to disrupt the core mechanics of the battle. You should not dispense Kokomi or Barbara as your healer either, if you have no other options – in fact, fan-favorite Bennett can be a problem due to the boss’ AoE attacks, which can cover his entire healing circle and effectively force you to waste his Burst.



 Drops For Beating All-Devouring Narwhal (Materials) 
          

Aside from Varunada Lazurite Ascension materials, randomized Artifacts, Mora, EXP, and potential weapon billets, the All-Devouring Narwhal has unique Talent materials to farm. They are Lightless Mass, Lightless Eye of the Maelstrom, and Lightless Silk String. These items are used to enhance the Talents of several characters. While the fight against the All-Devouring Narwhal can be tough, it is certainly worth it when considering the resources it provides in Genshin Impact.
