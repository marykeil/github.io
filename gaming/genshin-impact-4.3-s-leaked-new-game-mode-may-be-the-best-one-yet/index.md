## Literature Review

A new Genshin Impact leak connected to the upcoming Version 4.3 suggests a limited sniper game mode that might as well be the best one so far.




A new game mode has been featured in the Genshin Impact 4.3 leaks ahead of the version’s release later in December. The upcoming patch is expected to continue the content revolving around the region of Fontaine, introduced to Teyvat earlier this year, even if it does not directly explore main campaign quests within the nation of Hydro – Version 4.2 added the last Archon Quests in the region before a pause, and properly concluded the story involving Focalors, Furina, Neuvillette, and many other heroes. As a live-service game, however, HoYoverse’s popular action RPG will continue to receive content moving forward, much of which has already been leaked.




Navia’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.3, for instance, leaked even before she was confirmed as a new playable 5-star Geo character in the game. Even though character leaks tend to be some of the more enticing pieces of content that are shared, gameplay features are also well appreciated. According to leaks, farming will get easier in Genshin Impact 4.3 due to the implementation of a new and minor tweak to Domains. Now, new leaks indicate that the title will receive a completely new game mode, which may as well just be one of the best ones so far – though it may be time-limited.

 Genshin Impact 4.3 Leaks Point Toward A Sniper Mini-Game 
          




It seems like in Version 4.3, players will be able to engage in a sniper-based mini-game, which will be part of a larger event with multiple game modes. According to an alleged Genshin Impact leak by hhw, later shared by a Redditor, the flagship event for the upcoming patch will feature a sniper game mode in which the Traveler needs to use a limited amount of ammunition to eliminate enemies. The leaks say that considering the limited amount of ammo, players may have to either straighten their shots or get creative when trying to take out their opponents.



One of the pictures in the Reddit post features two Hilichurls next to an explosive barrel, which may mean, players will have to use other elements in the environment to optimize their kills and handle the limited number of rounds they can fire.

Still, according to the leaks, some stages in the leaked sniper mini-game mode will have extra objectives, such as defending goals from attacking enemies. In one of the pictures posted on Reddit, a Mitachurl and two Hilichurls are seen trying to attack a Transport Balloon, similar to those of the Daily Commissions, but in Fontaine. Considering the challenge presented by the leaked sniper mini-game in Genshin Impact 4.3, which may require some gameplay creativity to circumvent the lack of ammo, along with the extra goals, such as defending cargo, this could be one of the best limited game modes so far.

New mini-games and game modes are presented with nearly every update in the game, as the game frequently features limited-time events. These alternative modes allow players to participate in different types of gameplay while grinding to obtain prizes, such as resources, Primogems, and even free characters. Players could get a free Freminet in Genshin Impact 4.2, for instance, by gathering Thelxie’s Badges, which were given out for completing the event’s story missions, as well as tackling the limited-time game modes. In that same event, players had several mini-games to complete, including a combat challenge mode and a puzzle that involved solving various stages with broken circuitry.




Though the mini-games presented vary quite a bit in concept, the leaked sniper mode in Version 4.3 seems a lot more exciting than the most recent additions. The current patch’s game modes, while innovative, lacked a certain appeal in terms of gameplay. The Motherboard Troubleshooting puzzles in Genshin Impact only really posed a small challenge in the final stage, while Purgation Counterstrike was a combat mode with an alternative mechanic that did not change things in much of a memorable way. Record of the Search For Glory made good use of the underwater exploration mechanics, but the stages were very limited and short.

This left the feeling that a lot more could have been done with the game mode. The very concept of the allegedly leaked sniper game mode, however, seems simple enough to be challenging from the start. Players know they need to fend off enemies with limited ammunition and that they can use elements in the environment to maximize their kill rate with a single bullet. The game mode could offer progressively increasing challenges as players get deeper into later stages, with more enemies trying to destroy objectives that need to be defended in Genshin Impact 4.3, as well as a more strategic approach to the limited amount of ammo.






 Sniper Mode May Be   To New Genshin Impact Characters 
         

Although guns are not particularly new to the world of Teyvat, with several enemies – especially Fatui agents – shooting rifles against the player, this may be the first time they are actually in control of firearms. This may be related to a duo of new characters arriving in the Genshin Impact 4.3 banners. The upcoming patch will introduce Navia and Chevreuse, two heroes from Fontaine. Navia, a 5-star character, fights with a claymore. However, part of her leaked gameplay kit sees her use her umbrella as a firearm. Chevreuse is another character who uses a firearm – although she equips a polearm, Chevreuse fires a rifle with her abilities.

As such, the sniper game mode could be related to any of the two characters. Previous leaks, which may be confirmed during the Genshin Impact 4.3 livestream, indicate that the flagship event will be called “Guns and Roses” and will be focused on Navia – the sniper mini-game would fit well into this event, both due to its name and the character it revolves around. It is also said that this event will feature a crossover between Inazuma and Fontaine, with several characters from the Nation of Electro visiting the Nation of Hydro.




Other than what has already been leaked, little else is known about the upcoming patch. More should come to light with the 4.3 livestream, expected to be held on December 8. If there are no delays, the update itself should be implemented on December 20. Although it may be lacking more Archon Quests for now, it does seem like Genshin Impact 4.3 will make up for it with a long list of contents to play through, one of which may be the best game mode developed so far.
