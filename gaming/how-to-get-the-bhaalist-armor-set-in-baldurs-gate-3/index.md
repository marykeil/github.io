## Literature Review

Those who accept dark urges to murder in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 have a chance to get the Bhaalist Armor set, which has magical properties to help in combat.





Not every class has the proficiency to wield Light Armor like the one from the Bhaalist set. However, if you build your character to get a particular Feat in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you might be able to add light armor to the list of gear you can use. Companions like Lae&#39;Zel, Shadowheart, or Astarion might also benefit from the Bhaalist Armor, with their own affinities toward that type of protection.




  


 Find The Murder Tribunal 

 

The first step toward getting the Bhaalist armor is finding the Murder Tribunal in Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. You can reach this area as soon as your party ventures into the Lower City toward the final part of the game&#39;s story. Some exploration around this area should help you find the password and location of a Tribunal being held for the most loyal followers of the god Bhaal.

Head northeast of the Lower City toward Elfsong Tavern to discover a new area named Candulhallow&#39;s Tombstones. During the &#34;Investigate the Murders&#34; side quest, you might have been able to stop the NPC Dolor from killing more people in the name of a Bhaalist cult. This mission is tied to the Open Hand Temple murders in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which you can run into before entering the main city.






If you are having trouble figuring out how to open the path toward the Bhaalist Murder Tribunal, check out the video from YouTube creator ZaFrostPet that shows how to unlock the hidden door leading to the cult&#39;s base.




In this quest, managing to kill Dolor or another cultist named Olfaith should give you the password &#34;Sicarius&#34; to use in Candulhallow&#39;s Tombstones. Look for the office in the Tavern upstairs, and try to find a button along the walls that moves a shelf when pressed. Doing this reveals a door with strange symbols you can open when you learn the password.



Those who roll high enough on a History or Investigation check for the door in Elfsong Tavern can learn the connection between it and the Bhaalist cultists long before solving the Open Hand Temple murders.






 Become An Unholy Assassin 
          




Follow the path past the door to reach the Murder Tribunal Antechamber, guarded by Bhaal worshipers named That Which Guards. This collection of murder-happy fanatics is led by a former boss of Baldur&#39;s Gate, last seen in the &#34;Throne of Bhaal&#34; expansion of Baldur&#39;s Gate 2, Sarevok. Naturally, entering this space uninvited will create tension between your party and Sarevok.

                  All Legendary Armor In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Ranked   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has five pieces of legendary armor for players to discover, each providing some incredible abilities. But how do they compare?   

The only way to become accepted in this place is to convince Sarevok that your heart longs to kill just as much as everyone else in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. You need to present proof of your bloodlust and make a successful Deception or similar Charisma check with a severed hand at your side. If you looted Dolor before, you should have picked up a hand he cut from one of the Open Hand Temple victims.






You or someone in your party could boost your chances of passing the Charisma check with Sarevok using the Guidance spell or another magical incantation like Charm Person. Be careful, though, as Sarevok may be able to realize he&#39;s been charmed on higher-difficulty campaigns.




Those who pass Sarevok&#39;s test will be asked to speak to the spirit of someone they have killed before and describe how the creature was slain. You need to provide an evil-sounding answer from the dialogue choices to earn Sarevok&#39;s interest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. From here, you will be given a third and final test to prove your allegiance to Bhaal once and for all.

Your party will be led into a smaller chamber to kill Inspector Valeria and prove that your murderous intent was real. Valeria is the hollyphant investigator in the Open Hand Temple murders, so they might recognize you as you seal their fate. Only by murdering Valeria will Sarevok anoint you in a pool of blood and give you the title of Unholy Assassin of Bhaal in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.​​​​​​​






 Purchase The Bhaalist Armor Set 
          

Becoming an Unholy Assassin gives you access to all the Murder Tribunal Antechamber and all the NPC vendors found within it. Go back to the main room of this area and try to find the Echo of Abazigal merchant who stands to the left of Sarevok&#39;s throne. This creepy dragonborn Bhaalspawn will sell you several items just like any other vendor in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that you&#39;ve encountered.

The Bhaalist Armor can be seen among the Echo of Abazigal&#39;s wares, but you need 3,600 Gold to purchase this magical gear. This is Very Rare Light Armor and might even rival some Legendary Armor in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that you could find from various bosses. The Bhaalspawn vendor will gladly barter for the Bhaalist Armor to &#34;aid in enacting your foul whims&#34; if you offer up older gear in exchange.




                  Best Rare Armor in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Location &amp; How To Find   While only the first act is available in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 early access, there are lots of special pieces of armor and accessories for players to find.   

Characters that put on the Bhaalist Armor are given a base 14 Armor Class that may get boosted depending on their Ability Scores. There are two magical traits to this armor - the Aura of Murder and Ambusher passive abilities. Ambusher allows any character wearing the armor to have a &#43;2 bonus to Initiative rolls in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which lets them have an earlier turn at the start of combat.

The Aura of Murder is similar to the auras created by the Paladin but through armor instead of a class feature. Enemies within 2m of the character wearing the armor become Vulnerable to piercing damage unless they are resistant or immune to that type of damage. Those wielding a spear or another weapon with piercing damage can use this strong magical trait to decimate enemy health.




As you prepare your party for the final battles in Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the Bhaalist Armor might be the perfect gear to face the challenges that lie ahead.
