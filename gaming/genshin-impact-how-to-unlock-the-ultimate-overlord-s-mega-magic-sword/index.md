## Literature Review

The Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword is a new weapon in Genshin Impact. Here’s how to get it, refine it, and the best characters to equip it with.





The Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword offers some decent stats for a 4-star weapon. Its base attack stat (565 at level 90) is a bit below most 5-star claymores but is still a great addition for a F2P (free-to-play) 4-star weapon. This claymore in Genshin Impact also has Energy Recharge as its sub-stat (30.6% at level 90). What is impressive about the weapon is that its skill can see the user’s ATK boosted by a maximum of 24% if they have helped out all the Melusine villagers in Merusea. This makes the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword a great fit for a select number of claymore characters.




                  Genshin Impact: Chevreuse Character Ascension (&amp; Materials)   You will need to farm a lot of materials to fully Ascend Chevreuse and her Talents in Genshin Impact. Here’s everything you need to gather.   


 How To Get Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword For Free In Genshin Impact 
          

To get the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword 4-star claymore, you will have to participate in the Roses and Muskets flagship event in Version 4.3. The F2P weapon is locked behind progress through the event. To unlock the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword, you will have to gather 200 Theater Tickets in Genshin Impact. This special and limited point-based currency can be gathered by partaking in several mini-game activities offered during the event. You can challenge the Sharpshooting Zone, the Xtreme Drive, Into the Frame, and Trick Shots, Tricky Lights.




Getting the 200 Theater Ticket points should not be too difficult, as a fair amount is rewarded for the completion of each phase in every mini-game. In the first phase of the Sharpshooting Zone mode, for instance, you get 50 Theater Ticket points for completing the challenge and can get an extra 50 points if you do it with at least 10 munitions remaining. This alone covers half of what is needed to unlock the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword F2P claymore in Genshin Impact. Of course, you can get these Theater Tickets from any of the aforementioned mini-game modes in the Roses and Muskets flagship event.



The Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword can only be claimed until January 15, 2023. After that date, it will become impossible to obtain the 4-star claymore, as is the case with other event-exclusive weapons that have debuted before, such as the Toukabou Shigure sword in Genshin Impact, as well as the popular Festering Desire.




Once you have obtained the 200 Theater Tickets through your preferred means, you will need to access the Roses and Muskets event page and in the bottom left corner of the card, click on the Joyous Gift option. There, you will be able to claim the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword at no additional cost. While you have unlocked the weapon itself, this is not the end of the task. You should continue playing, as you will obtain materials related to the F2P claymore, which will further enhance its abilities in Genshin Impact.






 How To Refine Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword In Genshin Impact 
          

To refine the Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword, you will need four copies of a special item called Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal. This item’s icon is represented by a roll of tape. To get this item, you will have to continue playing the mini-games offered by the Roses and Muskets flagship event and gathering Theater Ticket points in Genshin Impact. At 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 Ticket Points, you will be able to respectively claim the four copies of the refinement material Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal. These rewards can be claimed in the event page’s Joyous Gift feature, from where you first obtained the event-exclusive claymore.

Once you have these items, you will need to access the Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword’s details. This can be done by opening the inventory, selecting the weapon, and clicking the Details button. You can also do this through a character if they have the claymore equipped. All you need to do now is go to the Refine menu and add the Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal materials that you collected in the Genshin Impact 4.3’s Roses and Muskets flagship event mini-games. You should be able to max out Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword’s Refinement level through the event.




                  Genshin Impact: Navia Character Builds (Weapons, Artifacts, Team Comps)   You can increase Navia’s value as a DPS unit in Genshin Impact with the best build and ideal team comp to accompany her on-field Geo presence.   



The maximum number of Theater Tickets you can collect is 1,600, but the Joyous Gift rewards are capped at 1,200. This tier will not grant you an extra copy of Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal, but instead a Crown of Insight, a rare material that can be used to increase characters’ Talents from level 9 to 10.






 Best Characters For Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword In Genshin Impact 
         

While not as strong as some tailor-made 5-star weapons, the Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword is a great substitute claymore for some specific characters in the game. The best characters to use it are those that can take advantage of either its massive ATK buff or its Energy Recharge sub-stat. While not all claymore characters fit this description, some will work particularly well with the F2P weapon. The table below lists some of the best Genshin Impact characters to use the Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword:




 Best Characters For Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword   Character  Element  Why   Navia  Geo    The weapon&#39;s ATK is great for Navia&#39;s DPS role.   Its sub-stat helps Navia&#39;s Burst be available more often.      Eula  Cryo    Eula relies on her ATK stat.   Eula&#39;s Burst has a high Energy requirement.      Dehya  Pyro    The weapon can help supply Dehya with ATK, despite her problematic stat-scaling.   Dehya can keep her Burst-based AoE field up more often via Energy Recharge.      Chongyun  Cryo    Chongyun can keep his Burst-based AoE field up more often via Energy Recharge.      Beidou  Electro    Beidou is reliant on her Burst and on ATK for increased damage output.      Freminet  Cryo    ATK can help Freminet with his damage.   The weapon&#39;s Energy Recharge can help Freminet use his Burst more often.      



Event-exclusive weapons like the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword are not made available too often, so you should make sure you can claim and refine it in time. Once that is done, you will have a solid claymore choice for some characters. This weapon should not be overlooked if you do not have the best weapons for the aforementioned characters in Genshin Impact.
