## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the obvious choice for modern Dungeons &amp; Dragons video gaming, but there are plenty of other titles that still hold up today.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 might have set a new standard in Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games, but it&#39;s far from the only title associated with the tabletop game to offer a unique and rewarding experience. DnD video games have a rich history, from the unlicensed 1975 RPG dnd to huge projects from major developers. Not every experience has aged perfectly, but the best DnD video games are still plenty of fun today and can make for great alternatives to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

Unsurprisingly, the majority of video games associated with DnD fall somewhere in the roleplaying genre, but there&#39;s still plenty of variety to be found within. Classic CRPGs offer the robust depth of gameplay that paved the way for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, while some 2000s console titles distill things to a more action-oriented focus. Regardless of what angle they take, all the best DnD video games to play today are complete and engaging experiences that can be just as captivating as tabletop play.

 10  Dragonshard (2005) 
Liquid Entertainment
        

Dragonshard is one of the most original DnD games, taking things to the real-time strategy while throwing in a healthy dose of RPG elements for a unique blend. It also takes place in the setting of Eberron, with plenty of artificer technology to set it apart from other experiences. Dragonshard isn&#39;t necessarily a game for everyone, but anyone intrigued by the concept is likely to be satisfied by the inventive execution.





 9  Dark Sun: Shattered Lands (1993) 
Strategic Simulations
        

Many of the DnD games from the 1980s and early 90s feature plenty of charm, but it&#39;s hard to justify playing most of them today compared to titles introduced in the landscape that Baldur&#39;s Gate created. Dark Sun: Shattered Lands is one exception. The brutal desert land of Athas and party of gladiators make for a stark difference in flavor from what other DnD games offer, and its combat system still has appreciable depth today. Initially launched in unfinished form, Shattered Lands was able to shine when it was later patched, and it&#39;s now available as a bundle with its sequel Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager.





 8  Solasta: Crown of the Magister (2021) 
Tactical Adventures


 







The DnD 5e era hasn&#39;t been huge for video games outside of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but Solasta: Crown of the Magister is one title that has stood out in recent years. Developed with permission to use the DnD 5e Systems Reference Document, Solasta lacks a license for specific locations and characters but stays loyal to the tabletop mechanics. As a modern turn-based tactical RPG, this is the perfect choice for anyone who found battle strategy to be the most engaging part of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
Solasta: Crown of the Magister was released into Early Access in October 2020 and was funded initially by a Kickstarter campaign.

 7  The Temple of Elemental Evil (2003) 
Troika Games
        

The Temple of Elemental Evil is one of the most direct translations of the tabletop experience, as it bases itself on a classic DnD module rather than attempting to tell an entirely new story. This makes it better suited for those familiar with DnD than for the general market, and this niche appeal, combined with a host of bugs, resulted in a decent but less than enthusiastic critical reception. Between official patches and some community editions, the issues have been heavily cleaned up over the years, and it&#39;s definitely a title worth trying out.





 6  Neverwinter (2013) 
Cryptic Studios
        

Fantasy settings have been all the rage in MMOs since World of Warcraft and even before, and a DnD-based MMO feels like a no-brainer. It&#39;s no surprise that one such title goes by the name of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, but the best DnD MMO experience to pick up is Neverwinter, which maintains a stronger player base and a greater variety of content. Although the DnD 4e rules that serve as a basis for Neverwinter weren&#39;t very popular in tabletop play, they translate better to the DnD world than the 3.5e elements of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online.

 5  Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance (2001) 
Snowblind Studios
        

The Baldur&#39;s Gate games might have been smash hits, but porting them to consoles of the time wouldn&#39;t have been particularly feasible. The answer to this conundrum was Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance, which jumped to 3rd edition rules and wrangled things into a more linear gameplay experience. Although it might seem limited in some regards compared to the main titles, engaging gameplay and the highly interactive city of Baldur&#39;s Gate help it hold up as a valuable game on its own.

 4  Icewind Dale (2000) 
Black Isle Studios
        

If the chilly winds of the north sound more appealing than a temperate fantasy setting, Icewind Dale is the perfect RPG to embark upon. Developed by Black Isle Studios, which was more or less the direct predecessor of the modern Obsidian Entertainment, Icewind Dale takes elements established in the original Baldur&#39;s Gate games and Planescape: Torment and doubles down on the combat. Diablo players might feel more at home with the hack-and-slash focus here, even if the roleplay elements can take a backseat comparatively.

 3  Neverwinter Nights (2002) 
BioWare


 







Not to be confused with the MMO of a similar name (or a 1990s online game that ran on AOL), Neverwinter Nights is meant for a smaller co-op experience. Although it can also be played in singleplayer, the focus on excellent co-op mechanics is what gives Neverwinter Nights a unique attraction compared to its RPG predecessors like Baldur&#39;s Gate. The story and characters are engaging enough while failing to quite live up to the best DnD RPG narratives, but this is absolutely the one to play with friends.





 2  Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 (2000) 
BioWare


 







Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t the first game in the series to blow away the competition, as both of its predecessors are likewise excellent experiences. Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 may be even better than the first, leaning into higher-level play while refining many aspects of gameplay and delivering consistent character writing that feels spectacularly robust. It&#39;s substantially different from Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, especially when it comes to combat, but anyone who fell in love with the newest entry would likely find plenty of fun in returning to the past.

 1  Planescape: Torment (1999) 
Black Isle Studios
        

Planescape: Torment hasn&#39;t always gotten quite the same degree of attention as Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 or Icewind Dale, but it&#39;s not for any lack of quality. This excursion takes the isometric DnD experience to a stranger setting than ever before, and it doesn&#39;t hesitate to mine that setting for fascinating ideas and dark implications. Torment: Tides of Numenera more recently followed it up as a spiritual successor while dropping the DnD license, but the original Planescape: Torment is still a uniquely engaging Dungeons &amp; Dragons game to play today.
               Dungeons and Dragons   Franchise:   Dungeons &amp; Dragons    Original Release Date:   1974-00-00    Publisher:   TSR Inc., Wizards of the Coast    Designer:   E. Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson    Player Count:   2-7 Players
