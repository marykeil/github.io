## Literature Review

Aliens, Bigfoot, Vampires, serial killers, and instant death by lightning; here are 10 rare things that can happen in Red Dead Redemption 2.




Rare things are bound to happen in a game as large as Red Dead Redemption 2. These can range from random NPCs left in for the developer&#39;s amusement, to peculiar Stranger interactions that only occur at certain times and places, to hidden secrets players have hunted down or figured out. With so much to explore, it&#39;s understandable that a lot of these things go unnoticed by most.
But some players are dedicated, and will go to great lengths to find the weirdest parts of RDR2: areas intended to be inaccessible, loot drops that are hard to come by, and unexpectedly tough enemy encounters. Red Dead Redemption 2 really pushes the boundaries of its Wild West setting with some of its Easter eggs, including the likes of UFOs, ghosts, and other mythical creatures. Regardless of the reason they&#39;re included in the game, these rare experiences are definitely something to look out for on one&#39;s next playthrough of RDR2.

 10  Players Can Spot A UFO In RDR2 
Location: Near Emerald Ranch And Mount Shann
        

Aliens exist in Red Dead Redemption 2, even if they are rarely discovered by players. Rockstar has a history of putting UFOs in their games as hidden Easter eggs, going as far back as GTA San Andreas. There are two locations in which to spot these UFOs, the first located in a shack north of Emerald Ranch. The player will encounter several skeletons and a note detailing alien activity. The note reads in part, &#34;At the second hour under the half-moon.&#34; Be patient, and wait until 2 AM on a night with a half-moon to hopefully witness a bright green UFO through the roof of the cabin.
The second sighting is similar in nature, but much harder to figure out, and often skipped on by players. After careful examination of the note&#39;s last line, which reads, &#34;And worship once again at the peak of Mount Shann,&#34; the player should head for that location. Similar to the other sighting, wait until 1 AM to see the UFO beyond the mountain rocks. Other than being an exciting addition for dedicated Rockstar fans, these rare sightings have no lasting impact on the game.





 9  A Ghost Train Rarely Appears In RDR2 
Location: Near Lemoyne
        

There&#39;s nothing rare about seeing trains in Red Dead Redemption 2, but many players have yet to come across the elusive Ghost Train. This is another Easter egg, referencing a common folklore subject in the American West. It may also be a nod to the Phantom Train boss in Final Fantasy 6. It can take a few tries to catch the Ghost Train, and while there isn&#39;t a tangible reward for finding it, the experience is interesting nonetheless.
To find the Ghost Train in RDR2, travel northwest of Lemoyne. Camp out until 3AM. When the Ghost Train is nearby, Arthur or John&#39;s horse will snort and stomp its feet. It&#39;s also possible to hear the Ghost Train coming, but it may not be distinguishable from a regular train. However, the Ghost Train doesn&#39;t necessarily appear every night. If nothing happens, repeat these steps for a few more nights until it does. The Ghost Train is notably smaller than other in-game trains, with a rare blueish-white glimmer. Sadly, the train cannot be interacted with, and will disappear after a short time.
