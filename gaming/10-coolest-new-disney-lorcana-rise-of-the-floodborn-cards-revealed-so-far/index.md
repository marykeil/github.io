## Literature Review

Many cards from the upcoming Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn set have already been showcased, and some stand out as the must-haves.




The upcoming Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn set will bring a huge new batch of cards to the collectible trading card game, and many that feature interesting flavor or powerful abilities have already been revealed. Rise of the Floodborn announcements have been a steady trickle since it was first revealed in September, with an initial batch of reveals being followed by individual showcases that help to build anticipation for the eventual release.
Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn will first arrive at local game stores on November 17, followed by a wide release in December. If the launch goes anything like The First Chapter, it&#39;s possible that a supply shortage could make stocking up on new booster packs somewhat difficult. For anyone who does get their hands on the product, however, it&#39;s helpful to know what cards should be fun and effective to use in actual play.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards 
Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is releasing soon, with new cards arriving via Illumineer&#39;s Troves, Gift Sets, and more in this second set.













 








 10  Bucky: Squirrel Squeak Tutor 
73/204, Emerald
        

Bucky: Squirrel Squeak Tutor might look like an innocuous little guy, but he has the potential to wreak some serious havoc against Disney Lorcana control decks that are currently a big part of the meta. Having Ward makes it impossible to easily get rid of this cheap card without it first being exerted, and Bucky being in play makes it possible to eat through an opponent&#39;s cards on the table. It&#39;s somewhat niche, as it won&#39;t have the same degree of efficacy against every kind of opponent, but this could be the ruination of an Amethyst/Ruby power player.





 9  Tigger: One Of A Kind 
127/204, Ruby


 







Tigger: One of a Kind is all about combos with action cards, as putting them into play can give him a plus-two bonus to strength for the turn. Once again, this card has some real situational might, particularly as a counter to the terrifyingly effective Emerald card Kuzco: Temperamental Emperor. Its relevance in play will no doubt be helped by the general lack of strong Ruby three-drop cards in The First Chapter, although it&#39;s unlikely to be a true Rise of the Floodborn staple.
            
 
 What Are Floodborn, Dreamborn, &amp; Storyborn Cards In Disney Lorcana? 
Disney Lorcana’s second set is Rise of the Floodborn, so here is a breakdown of the differences between Floodborn, Dreamborn, and Storyborn.









 8  Fang Crossbow 
166/204, Sapphire
        

The standout feature of the Fang Crossbow is this item card&#39;s ability to banish chosen Dragon characters by questing, an impressive ability for an inkable three-drop. Just how useful this will be in practice depends on how many Dragons arrive in Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn and future expansions, although its very existence implies that plans are certainly in place. For all the times when that isn&#39;t coming into play, expending two ink and questing lets the Fang Crossbow provide a more generic effect of reducing an enemy card&#39;s strength by two for the turn.





 7  Gaston: Intellectual Powerhouse 
147/204, Sapphire
        

The biggest cool factor of Gaston: Intellectual Powerhouse is just how funny the Disney Lorcana card is, playing up a fundamental juxtaposition in the perfect way. The chalkboard behind him is worth the price of admission alone. As an added bonus, it could be solid in play, with good stats across the board and a Shift ability to get it onto the board a little early. Playing it also offers a glance at the top three cards of a deck and the selection of one, helping to curate the perfect hand.
            
 
 Everything In Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Illumineer&#39;s Trove 
Similar to The First Chapter of Disney Lorcana, its second set, Rise of the Floodborn, will include an Illumineer’s Trove full of great products.









 6  Mulan: Reflecting 
16/204, Amber


 







Mulan: Reflecting is a great card to have in any Disney Lorcana Amber deck focusing on songs, with potential to get plenty of songs in play for free if the deck is well-saturated with them. A shift ability lets this combo get set up early, although it&#39;s not yet clear what low-cost Mulan will be available in Rise of the Floodborn to make this possible. This should appropriately pair nicely with the song card Reflection, elevating one of the least relevant options from The First Chapter.





 5  Donald Duck: Perfect Gentleman 
77/204, Emerald
        

Any card with good draw support is worth paying attention to in Disney Lorcana, and Donald Duck: Perfect Gentleman is certainly no slouch there. The Allow Me ability lets each player draw a card at the start of its bearer&#39;s turn, which can be useful in varying degrees depending on the balance of draw between players. It&#39;s also an exciting addition for Donald Duck fans in general, as the character didn&#39;t have any cards in The First Chapter that were likely to see as much play as this one.
            
 
 How to Build A Custom Deck in Disney Lorcana 
Building a Disney Lorcana deck can be easy and fun, but it also requires strategy with the different card types as well as understanding ink.









 4  The Queen: Commanding Presence 
26/204, Amber
        

The Queen: Commanding Presence is a powerful Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn option to make winning challenges with weaker cards completely viable, with an efficacy compounded by how easy it is to get Amber cards on the table to throw at opponents. Every time she quests, a chosen opposing character loses four strength for the turn and an allied character can gain four, heavily tipping the scales. A Shift ability and the generation of two lore when questing round out a very complete package.





 3  Beast: Relentless 
70/204, Emerald
        

Beast: Relentless earns its status as a Legendary Disney Lorcana card with its Second Wind ability. Every time an opposing character is damaged, the Beast can be readied, with no unique restrictions on challenging or questing past that point. Played right, this card can get in a terrifying amount of extra maneuvers, and readying it at the end of a turn could also make it hard for opponents to take out without a Banish ability.





 2  Cinderella: Stouthearted 
177/204, Steel
        

Getting Rise of the Floodborn card Cinderella: Stouthearted into play can cost up to seven ink, but once she&#39;s on the table, she can prove to be a huge nuisance. Strength and willpower of five each are compounded by a Resist &#43;2 ability that reduces incoming damage, and The Singing Sword lets her challenge ready characters whenever a song is played. Three lore generation per quest make her a menace even when she isn&#39;t on the offensive. It&#39;s also possible to get her out a little early with Shift 5 if other Cinderella cards are in play.
            
 
 One New Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Card Type Makes Dealing Damage Harder 
Rise of the Floodborn is set to shake up Disney Lorcana, and one new card type that it introduces could significantly alter the balance of challenges.









 1  Belle: Hidden Archer 
72/204, Emerald


 







If Cinderella: Stouthearted is pesky, Belle: Hidden Archer is the next level of nuisance. Challenging Belle requires the challenging player to discard their hand, and her three lore generation makes it possible for her to rack up points quickly while an opponent is scrambling for a Banish card. A Shift ability lets her enter play ahead of most removal options. The only real downside is the fact that she can&#39;t be inked, but when getting her on the table is this good, it&#39;s hard to argue that she isn&#39;t an obvious Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn standout.
