# 13 Fastest Mario Kart 8 Setups


## SUMMARY 


 Customization is key in Mario Kart 8. Mixing and matching tires, karts, gliders, and characters is essential for creating the fastest kart setup. 
 Choosing heavy characters can result in higher top speeds, as long as they avoid obstacles. Heavy characters like Donkey Kong, Roy, and Bowser are preferred for their speed potential. 
 Speed is not the only factor to consider when building a kart. Acceleration, handling, and traction also play important roles in finding the optimal setup. Balanced builds, like Baby Daisy with the Pipe Frame kart, can excel in certain situations.

## Literature Review

With hundreds of possible kart combinations, it can be tough for new players to discover the fastest Mario Kart 8 setups. These are the very best.




Mario Kart 8, easily one of the greatest kart racers of all time, includes plenty of vehicle customization options to make each race the fastest possible run. Players are free to mix and match their tires, kart, glider, and, of course, character. In Mario Kart 8, it&#39;s important to keep track of all five stats of speed, acceleration, weight, handling, and traction, and how they correlate with each other, in order to get the speediest set-up possible.
But building the fastest kart in Mario Kart 8 isn&#39;t just about the kart, character choice is a major factor. Although heavy characters weigh down their karts to end up with the slowest acceleration, they also, ultimately, have the highest speed as long as they don&#39;t run into any obstacles along the way. Thus, when looking for the best Mario Kart 8 setups, heavy characters are preferred. In addition, while there are no gliders that increase speed, there are some to be aware of that reduce it.
            
 
 15 Best Characters To Play As In Mario Kart 8, Ranked 
Fans of Mario Kart 8 claim their favorite character is the sure-fire winner, but the roster&#39;s stats may prove that favorite doesn&#39;t always mean best.












 








 13  Donkey Kong, B Dasher Kart, Triforce Tires &amp; Super Glider 
Total Of 5.25 Max Speed Possible


 







Donkey Kong has the second-highest base speed of all characters, as long as the player is adept at not hitting any obstacles to slow down this heavy class ape, as his acceleration is a slow burn. Combined with the B Dasher kart, the Triforce tires, and the Super Glider, he can reach exceptionally high speeds. The tires also help with his traction, which is extremely helpful for heavy characters. Though it can seem more boring, the default glider is preferred so that the kart&#39;s speed will not suffer from the penalties other gliders have. With this build, DK reaches a total of 5.25 speed.





 12  Roy, Standard ATV Kart, Gold Tires &amp; Plane Glider 
Total Of 5.5 Max Speed Possible
        

Alongside Donkey Kong, Roy is a heavy character who is tied for having the second-highest possible base speed, and with the perfect kit, he can be very fast. Both the Standard ATV kart and Gold tires provide him with extra speed but come at the cost of acceleration and handling. Lastly, the Plane Glider slightly increases his traction at the cost of a small increase in his weight. This is an overall fast build, reaching 5.5 max speed, making it one of the best Mario Kart 8 setups.





 11  Baby Daisy, Biddybuggy, Roller, Cloud Glider 
Total Of 0.75 Max Speed Possible
        

This is a pretty unorthodox combination when going for speed, but speed itself isn&#39;t the only stat that dictates how fast a kart can cross the finishing line. With 0.75 max speed, this would be one of the worst Mario Kart builds for normal play. However, with 5.5 acceleration, it could come in handy on 150cc or 200cc when speed can easily become a detriment, and the need to quickly recover from mistakes is greater. Acceleration can be the Achilles heel of some kart configurations, and this Baby Daisy kart combination takes that into account. In the right situation, and with the right player behind the controls, Baby Daisy can easily take home the trophy.
            
 
 Building Mario Kart 8â€™s Worst Kart 
Mario Kart 8 is usually all about being the fastest on the racetrack, but players can instead lose with glory in the worst vehicle in the game.








 10  Wario, Circuit Special Kart, Metal Tires &amp; Wario Wing 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible


 







At 4.75, Wario has the highest possible character speed in the game, making him a go-to for speed-focused kart configurations. Adding the Circuit Special Kart and the Metal tires adds an extra 1.0 speed at the cost of acceleration, handling, and traction. Finish the build with his iconic Wario Wing to reach 5.75 max speed, making this one of the fastest builds in the game.
Great speed comes great risk, as racers will have to contend with some less-than-optimal kart handling when using this Wario build, as well as several others in this list. 






 9  Bowser, P-Wing Kart, Kart Gold Tires &amp; Hylian Kite 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible
        

Bowser is known throughout all Mario lore for being a massive entity and, therefore, it is fitting that he is the heaviest character in Mario Kart 8. Being the heaviest also means he is among the fastest, however. Combining his default 4.75 base speed with the P-Wing kart and the Kart Gold tires brings him to the speed cap of the game, which is 5.75. Adding the Hylian Kite ensures that Bowser isn&#39;t losing any speed for the glider while also not gaining any extra weight that could make this build impossible to control, as it will already require a steady hand to manage this kart effectively at top speed.





 8  Morton, P-Wing Kart, Cyber Slick Tires &amp; Waddle Wing 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible
        

Morton sides with Bowser and Wario as one of the heaviest, and thus fastest, characters in the game. Although the P-Wing kart significantly reduces Morton&#39;s other stats, the maximum speed increase is too good to ignore. Combined with the Cyber Slick tires, Morton reaches the speed cap of 5.75, while the Waddle Wing glider ensures that he doesn&#39;t lose speed or get weighed down.
Given how little he&#39;s seen in standard Mario games, Bowser&#39;s Koopalings, like Morton, are oft-overlooked characters that Mario Kart 8 fans should consider more often, particularly in the case of Morton for his beneficial stats that will sneak up on unsuspecting opponents.





 7  Dry Bowser, Mercedes GLA, Slick Tires &amp; Hylian Kite 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible


 







Despite being slightly lighter than the other heavy characters, Dry Bowser maintains a high base speed of 4.75. In addition, the good-looking Mercedes GLA and the Slick tires allow Dry Bowser to reach a swift 5.75 max speed, the fastest possible in the game. Some players shrugged off the free Mercedes Mario Kart DLC when it originally came out, viewing it as a bit of an obvious product placement, and therefore, snub the idea of using the shiny vehicle in races. A few of the karts that were added with that expansion, however, can really help certain characters.





 6  Baby Daisy, Pipe Frame, Standard Tires &amp; Wario Wing 
Emphasis On Acceleration And Handling


 







This is another of the best setups that don&#39;t focus on all-out speed. Instead, combining Baby Daisy with the Pipe Frame kart places an emphasis on acceleration and handling. While heavy characters like Wario could be doing laps around this lightweight kart and character, there are always going to be some circumstances where this will be the better option.
It seems like an odd trade-off, but, at some point, increased speed becomes reckless and can result in slower lap times, particularly for certain tracks that are heavy in curves and obstacles. While there are certainly some advanced Mario Kart players who can make just about anything work on any setting, for normal players, measured builds such as these will often prevail.

Mario Kart 8 continues to be a popular game and Nintendo has done amazing at providing updates and new content. But what about the Switch 2?








 5  Bowser, Badwagon Kart, Cyber Slick Tires &amp; Super Glider 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible
        

Bowser is integral to some of the fastest builds in Mario Kart 8 due particularly to his heavy size and speed when he is able to pick up momentum. With the Badwagon kart and the Cyber Slick tires, he can reach a max speed of 5.75. In addition, the default Super Glider ensures that Bowser doesn&#39;t have to sacrifice multiple stats for this high speed. Not only is he a challenging villain to deal with in platformers, but Bowser is also one of the fastest opponents to face in Mario Kart 8.





 4  Morton, Circuit Special Kart, Slick Tires &amp; Plane Glider 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible
        

Morton&#39;s high base speed of 4.75 can skyrocket with the Circuit Special kart and the Slick Tires, up to the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#39;s cap of 5.75. Although this build significantly reduces acceleration and traction, it is a worthy price to pay for being so fast. Skilled drivers who can maintain max speed can make this build really shine. That said, on 200cc, this setup becomes something of a nightmare to control, as do most of the ultra-fast kart setups in the game.





 3  Bowser, Landship, Standard Tires &amp; Cloud Glider 
Total Of 4 Max Speed Possible
        

As opposed to other Bowser builds that strictly prioritize speed, this is more of a jack-of-all-trades heavy kart that maintains a relatively high max speed of 4 without sacrificing acceleration or handling. While the handling stat could be a bit sturdier at 2.75, with 3.75 acceleration, this Bowser build isn&#39;t perfect for speedrunning but won&#39;t be nearly as slow to start as he&#39;d normally be.
This build is much more practical for the above-average player who is not an expert, giving a little more allowance for anything slowing him down. While most speed builds focus purely on just that stat without accommodating inevitable heat-of-the-moment mistakes, this setup is as fast as it needs to be, while still giving the player a sense of control.





 2  Wario, Mercedes GLA, Kart Gold Tires &amp; Wario Wing 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible
        

Wario&#39;s high base speed of 4.75 combines with the iconic Mercedes GLA and the Kart Gold tires to effortlessly do the trick if players are looking for speed. Wario reaches the 5.75-speed cap at the cost of greatly reducing his acceleration, which can, admittedly, be a real problem in chaotic situations. Nevertheless, the Mercedes GLA offers increased handling and reduced weight compared to most of the other fastest cars in the game. As long as the players can reach the maximum speed without problems, this setup will help make it easier to maintain, which makes this one of the best Mario Kart 8 setups.





 1  Dry Bowser, B Dasher Kart, Metal Tires &amp; Gold Glider 
Total Of 5.75 Max Speed Possible
        

Dry Bowser is able to maintain the same maximum speed as Bowser and Morton with the added bonus of slightly reduced weight. Equipping him with the B Dasher kart and the Metal tires ensures he can effortlessly reach the cap of 5.75. If the player manages to get ahead and reach max speed while also utilizing some items like blue shells, bananas, and fake item boxes, victory is almost guaranteed. In addition, the Gold gilder allows Dry Bowser to win and look good in his full Mario Kart 8 glory while doing it.
