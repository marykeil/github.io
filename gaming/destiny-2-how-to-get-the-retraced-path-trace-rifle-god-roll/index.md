## Literature Review

Retraced Path is a Legendary Trace Rifle that was added during Destiny 2&#39;s 30th Anniversary update. This Solar weapon is excellent for add clear.





Many players prefer Trace Rifles as they are quite precise and now have a Solar/Void option. There are quite a few other Legendary Trace Rifles that have been added, but the Retraced Path is quite versatile and fits many playstyles. Since Retraced Path is a Legendary gun, Guardians can bring a strong Exotic weapon that synergizes with a Solar subclass.

 How To Craft Destiny 2&#39;s Retraced Path Trace Rifle God Roll 
          

Getting the Retraced Path requires Guardians to complete the Dares of Eternity activity and get Treasure Keys as drops. These Treasure Keys can unlock Xur&#39;s Treasure Hoard, which grants a weapon with each unlock. Since the unlocking method depends on RNG in Destiny 2, you might need to acquire multiple Treasure Keys to get the desired Trace Rifle. 

In Season of Plunder, each of the Dares of Eternity weapons became craftable. Players will need to acquire five Deepsight versions of Retraced Path to fully unlock the Pattern. Once acquired, Guardians can travel to The Enclave in Destiny 2 to shape the weapon. The best God Roll for Retraced Path can be seen below:

  Barrel   Magazine   Trait 1   Trait 2    Arrowhead Break   Enhanced Battery   Subsistence   Golden Tricorn   






The Arrowhead Break and Enhanced Battery perks will give you better recoil control and larger magazine size. The Subsistence is another excellent perk that will let you partially overflow the magazine when an enemy is killed. Finally, Golden Tricorn makes final blows grant a temporary damage buff. While the buff is active, melee and grenade kills will further increase this buff to 50%. However, the abilities used will need to be Solar to match the damage type of Retraced Path.

Provided the proper set-up, Guardians can output immense damage with this Trace Rifle in Destiny 2. Dares of Eternity is a free activity, and all players can add Retraced Path to their collection.
