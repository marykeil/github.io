## Literature Review

There are several bosses in Genshin Impact, and this guide will show players the location of each one on the continuously expanding map of Teyvat. 





There are two categories of bosses. First are the world bosses, which are found scattered across the world of Teyvat. These opponents drop materials that are used to Ascend characters. Furina&#39;s character Ascension materials in Genshin Impact, for instance, require you to defeat the Hydro Tulpa boss in Fontaine. There are also weekly bosses – these are usually unlocked while progressing through the main Archon Quests. They are linked to the campaign and have a weekly limit on how many times they can be challenged for rewards. Weekly bosses in Genshin Impact drop materials needed for Talent leveling. What is needed for each character varies, both for Ascension and Talents.

 All Mondstadt Boss Locations In Genshin Impact 
        

If the weekly Trounce Domain bosses are considered, there are a total of six boss opponents in the region of Mondstadt in Genshin Impact. To the far northeast corner of the map, in the Stormbearer Mountains area, you can find the Anemo Hypostasis. As the name indicates, this is an Anemo-based elemental creature, so you should avoid using Anemo to beat it, as it has immunity to that element. To the far east of Mondstadt city, in a cave near the Thousand Winds Temple, you can encounter Cryo Regisvine. Using Pyro against it is a great strategy – avoid getting wet with Hydro, as its attacks can Freeze your character.
        

In a circular arena near Cape Oath lies the domain of the Electro Hypostatis. Dragonspine, which is considered part of the Mondstadt territory, also contains a world boss. You can find the Cryo Hypostasis lying in wait in a circular arena south of the Wyrmrest Valley, between the Entombed City Outskirts and the Entombed City - Ancient Palace. The Trounce Domain boss, Lupus Boreas, Dominator of Wolves can be found in the large arena in Wolvendom. The weekly boss Stormbringer is at the center of the tower in Stormterror&#39;s Lair. As Trounce Domain encounters in Genshin Impact, these battles need to be triggered, as the bosses are not wandering about.
Lupus Boreas is also known as Andrius, and constitutes the Trounce Domain challenge called the Wolf of the North. 






 All Liyue Boss Locations In Genshin Impact 
        

In Liyue, there are four world bosses that can be faced for Ascension materials. The first of them is the Oceanid, Rhodeia of Loch, which can be encountered near the Stone Gate. The creature&#39;s battle can be commenced by interacting with a puddle in its arena. In a cave near the Tianqiu Valley to the far west of Liyue, you can find the Primo Geovishap in Genshin Impact. This boss&#39; main element may change ahead of each fight – it does not change during the battle – and using elemental shields is key to surviving the encounter, so be sure to bring a Geo character to trigger Crystallize reactions.
        

Isolated in the northern island of the Guyun Stone Forest, you can encounter the Geo Hypostasis. This world boss needs to be defeated a few times for materials in Zhongli&#39;s Ascension in Genshin Impact, as well as some other Geo characters. Other than these four world bosses, Liyue is home to two weekly bosses. The first of them is Childe, who can be fought in the Golden House, south of Liyue Harbor. The second weekly boss in Liyue is Azhdaha. This dragon can be encountered in the domain beneath the Dragon-Queller tree in Nantianmen, on the west side of Mount Hulao.

Azhdaha, one of Genshin Impact’s weekly Trounce Domain bosses, should never be faced in co-op, despite being a considerably strong opponent.








 All Chasm Boss Locations In Genshin Impact 
        

Inside The Chasm, a subarea of the Liyue region, you can also encounter a world boss. The area is home to the Ruin Serpent. It can be a little bit difficult to get to the area once you enter The Chasm in Genshin Impact. Nevertheless, this is the only boss located in the area.
        

The Ruin Serpent drops materials that enhance the abilities of fan-favorite characters, like Yelan. You can also encounter important and rare opponents like the Black Serpents inside The Chasm, even though they are not considered bosses.





 All Inazuma Boss Locations In Genshin Impact 
        

Inazuma has six world bosses and two weekly boss opponents. The first of them is the Perpetual Mechanical Array, which can be found in a hidden underwater cave north of Narukami Island. To gain access to it, you will need to go through the well in Araumi and make your way through the cavern.
        

The second boss is the Pyro Hypostasis, which is isolated on an island north of the Kujou Encampment on Kannazuka. Like all other Hypostatis, it dwells in a circular arena, which can be seen on the in-game map in Genshin Impact.
        

The third boss, the Maguu Kenki, lies in the middle of Yashiori Island. This boss can be reached by teleporting to the highest Waypoint in the region and gliding down, westward. The fourth world boss in Inazuma is further south, on Seirai Island. This boss is a Thunder Manifestation, and it lies on a floating island on Amakumo Peak. To reach it, you will need to follow a series of puzzles that take you upward to the area of the boss.
Be sure to unlock the Teleport Waypoint at Amakumo Peak to facilitate reaching the Thunder Manifestation later on. 

        

The fifth world boss in Inazuma is the Hydro Hypostatis. This opponent is located at the north of Watatsumi Island. To access it, you will need to drop into a cave, which is situated directly west of Suigetsu Pool. You can teleport to the Palace in a Pool Domain in Genshin Impact, head outside using the Electrogranum to fly upward, and then move across the water, west, until you reach the hole through which you need to drop.
        

The sixth and last world boss in Inazuma is the Golden Wolflord. Its lair is at the very south of Tsurumi Island, in an arena of its own. You may need to make your way through the area&#39;s questline before unlocking the boss, as the island is engulfed in mist. Alternatively, you can use your Waverider to circle around the majority of the island and dock near the arena, where you can unlock the Teleport Waypoint and face the boss.
The Golden Wolflord&#39;s attacks ignore shields, so make sure to bring a strong and reliable healer to mitigate the damage received. 

        

Inazuma&#39;s La Signora is the first weekly boss, which can be battled in Tenshukaku, just outside of Raiden Shogun&#39;s palace on Narukami Island. The second weekly in the region is Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto, the Shogun herself. This encounter is located in a cave underneath the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Access to weekly bosses in Genshin Impact has improved as of Version 4.2. The game added a system optimization feature that allows you to quick-start these boss encounters even if you have not yet unlocked them through the story quests, as long as you have reached or surpassed Adventure Rank (AR) 40. In turn, you can farm resources for characters you may have even if you have not caught up with the campaign, through which these boss fights would normally be unlocked. The exceptions for the quick-start mechanic are Stormterror and the Wolf of the North Domains. 






 All Sumeru Boss Locations In Genshin Impact 
        

The Nation Sumeru in Genshin Impact has a total of seven world bosses. The Electro Regisvine can be encountered inside a cave that can be accessed through an entrance in the southeastern portion of the Mawtiyima Forest.
        

Further south, also in a cave, players can encounter the Aeonblight Drake. Access to its arena is through a tunnel at the north of the canyon in Devantaka Mountain or through a cave entrance in the west portion of the same area.
        

In a cave to the west of Vanarana, before the desert, lies the Jadeplume Terrorshroom. The access to this boss is a tunnel south of its location.
        

The southern portion of the Great Red Sands desert holds two world bosses. The Dendro Hypostasis is in a cave to the far east of the area, near Dar al-Shifa in Genshin Impact.
        

The Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network is to the west, inside the Dune of Elusion pyramid.
        

Up north and underground, near the Sands of Al-Azif, you will encounter the sandworm boss Setekh Wenut in Genshin Impact. Accessing its arena is quite simple, as there are holes in the ground that lead to it.
        

The last world boss in Sumeru is the Iniquitous Baptist, who can be found in a cave in the far west of Gavireh Lajavard. To access its arena, you will need to follow the road that is located southeast of its location into the cavern through a tunnel.
        

Sumeru, like most other regions in Genshin Impact, has two weekly bosses. The first of them is the Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom, which can be found in the Joururi Workshop, in the Chinvat Ravine southeast of Sumeru City. The second world boss is the Guardian of Apep&#39;s Oasis, whose Trounce Domain is underground, slightly north of the Sands of Three Canals.





 All Fontaine Boss Locations In Genshin Impact 


 







So far, in Fontaine, you can encounter five world bosses and a single weekly boss opponent. As Genshin Impact&#39;s fifth major Nation continues to expand, more challenging creatures will be added. The first world boss in the area is called Emperor of Fire and Iron, and it can be found near the entrance to Fontaine, at the very southwestern tip of the island of Poisson. However, this boss&#39; arena is in a cave that can only be accessed through an underwater tunnel and not on Poisson itself. The entrance to this cave can be found underwater, slightly northwest of the boss&#39; actual location.
        

The second world boss is the Icewind Suite, a boss that has two distinct forms – you may choose which of the bosses you want to face by interacting with the NPC photographing the arena, and each of them drops a different Ascension Material. The Icewind Suite is located to the northwest of the Fountain of Lucine in an open air arena.
        

The third world boss in Fontaine is called the Hydro Tulpa. This elemental creature can be encountered in a cave that can only be accessed through underwater exploration in Genshin Impact. This cave is located to the west of the Court of Fontaine. You need simply locate its entrance, follow the tunnel, and reach the boss.
        

The fourth world boss opponent in Genshin Impact is the Experimental Field Generator. Like the Icewind Suite, this boss is easily located above ground and does not require underwater exploration to be found. This creature can be found in a circular arena south of the Central Laboratory Ruins. The best way of getting to it is to teleport to the Waypoint closest to it and head south.
        

The fifth world boss in Fontaine is the Millennial Pearl Seahorse. This Electro-charged beast can be found in an underwater cavern, like most of the bosses in the region. While the boss&#39; arena is located slightly northeast of the New Fontaine Research Institute, access to the cavern is closer to the northwestern portion of Mount Esus East in Genshin Impact. Once you locate the entrance, finding the boss should be easy, as it is located at the far end of a straightforward tunnel.
        

In addition to the world bosses, Fontaine also has a weekly boss challenge. The first weekly Trounce Domain in the Nation of Hydro is against the All-Devouring Narwhal. Although its access through the main story happens through the Opera Epiclese, the Trounce Domain&#39;s location is actually underwater, south of Salacia Plain, just west of the waterway that passes through the area.
As the game continues to expand with new updates, it will also receive more world and weekly bosses. Although weekly boss additions seem to be limited to two per region, the number of new world boss depends on how big the region itself is and how many playable characters are added throughout the year in which the Nation is featured. Genshin Impact is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.
