## Literature Review

Playing a big-name game doesn’t always have to cost a lot of money, or any money at all. Steam has many great titles available for free.




As fun as it is to buy a brand-new game, sometimes it just isn&#39;t feasible with the budget, but, luckily, many games are available as free-to-play on Steam. While it is easy to mistakenly assume that a free game is smaller or not as well-designed, this is not the case when it comes to many of the options on the PC gaming platform. The list of free games on Steam can include everything from long-running MMOs, such as Guild Wars 2​​​​​, to the social simulation behemoth, The Sims 4, and although there may be additional purchases available within the games, there is a lot of content that can be enjoyed for free.
Steam&#39;s free-to-use game distribution platform has become the mainstay of PC gaming for many years now. With the added benefit of Valve&#39;s portable Steam Deck console, it is even easier to enjoy Steam games. Although the majority of titles on Steam cost money, it can be surprising just how many big, well-known games are free to enjoy, and not just for demos. These games typically have microtransactions within the game as a way for developers to earn money, or they might sell expansions and DLCs, but even without any of these purchases, there is still a lot of fun to be had.
