## Literature Review

A key ingredient for crafting the Focus Potion, Dugbog Tongue lies on enemies in Hogwarts Legacy close to the swamps of the open world.





You must first buy the Focus Potion recipe from J Pippin&#39;s Potions, a Hogsmeade shop, before you can use Dugbog Tongue. The Focus Potion has such a positive benefit that the recipe needed to unlock the item stands at an expensive 1,200 Gold. You must scrounge about the open world for any secrets or sell unused gear to accumulate enough gold to purchase the recipe. An easy way to quickly explore the wider wizarding world would be to upgrade a Broom, enabling you to zip around the map at your leisure.

                  Hogwarts Legacy: How to Sell Unwanted Gear   The stats of certain gear in Hogwarts Legacy can become unwanted as players progress, leading them to sell those items for galleons at various shops.    


 Where To Find Dugbog Tongue In Hogwarts Legacy 
          

To get Dugbog Tongue, you will need to defeat Dubob enemies that can usually be found in swampy areas such as the South Sea Bog section of the map. Since Dugbogs are fairly rare to encounter, you must explore these swampy areas as often as possible to gather Dugbog tongue. Unlike the other two ingredients, Dugbog tongue cannot be grown in Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Room of Requirement. In addition, the Dubgob can be challenging to defeat, so ensure you have enough healing potions when battling them.




While the bushes surrounding the swamps where Dugbogs reside might yield a couple of Lacewing Flies. The enemies are more elusive, as they sometimes spring up to attack without warning.



There are two types of Dugbogs, the Great Spined Dugbog and the more common Cottongrass Dugbog, usually spawn in groups to divide your attention in combat.




Engaging these foes whenever possible gives you plenty of chances to get a Dugbog Tongue in Hogwarts Legacy, provided you can overcome the threat these overgrown toads induce.
