## Literature Review

In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe there are now Mii costumes available for players to unlock, some of which can only be attained by scanning Amiibo figures.





While there are many characters to play in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and even more with the expansions, these costumes allow players to play as themselves, cosplaying as their favorite characters. The costumes can be unlocked by going to the main menu and accessing the NFC touchpoints before tapping an Amiibo figure on a JoyCon controller or a Pro Controller, which will then bring up a screen that shows you which Mii costumes have been unlocked and which ones have not.

 Every Mario Kart 8 Amiibo Mii Costume 
          

There are 21 costumes for the Mii characters in the game, including the newest addition of Daisy to the character roster in Mario Kart 8&#39;s Wave 6 Booster Course. Once unlocked, the Mii costumes can be accessed by going to the bottom of the character roster and selecting &#34;Mii suits,&#34; which will bring up a separate menu that you can scroll through to get to the suit you want. This menu also has a randomizer if players want to be surprised.



Multiple Amiibos can unlock the same Mii costume, most of which are listed below. For instance, the Mario Mii costume can be unlocked using any Mario Amiibo figure in your collection.
