## Literature Review

An Ikran is a massive winged creature that you can find and fly as a mount in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, letting you explore the world in new ways.





You find an Ikran during the &#34;Take Flight&#34; quest, a well-named mission tied to the 11th Chapter of the main story. Although this is close to the ending of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, there are still plenty of things to do with your mount once you bond with it. To start this quest, head to the Ikran Rookery and meet up with NPC Nefika in the floating mountains south of the Glade of Light area.




                  Can You Keep Playing Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora After Beating The Game?   There&#39;s plenty to do in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, which makes the question of whether its accessible after the credits roll an important one.

After a few cutscenes where you get to pick the name and appearance of your Ikran, you jump off the floating islands and press the D-pad Up or &#34;H&#34; input to call on your mount. The Ikran will catch you as you fall, before you transition into a third-person perspective of your character while flying. You will be shown a small tutorial for flight controls on the left side of your screen in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

You can Accelerate or Decelerate by pressing the &#34;W/S&#34; keys or moving the Left Stick forward or back on a controller. You can strafe from side to side while in flight by using the &#34;A/D&#34; inputs or by moving the Left Stick right or left. These are the basic ways to move your Ikran through the air as you avoid obstacles in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora or enemy attacks.




                  Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Fixes A Growing Problem With Open-World Games   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora isn&#39;t out yet, but one decision could go a long way in making it stand out from the crowd of open-world games.   

The &#34;Left Control&#34; key on PC, Circle on PlayStation, or B input on Xbox will land your Ikran safely for you to continue exploring Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora on foot. If you want to dash through the skies with a Speed Boost, press &#34;Spacebar&#34; on PC, X on PlayStation, or A on Xbox. There are ways to Free Look as you fly, letting you see behind you as your Ikran continues traveling in a set direction.



You have the ability to fight in combat from your mount, making Free Look very useful to attack enemies trailing behind your mount. Keep in mind that you can adjust your Ikran&#39;s path during Free Look for better control.




Your character can dismount your Ikran midair with the same commands used to land the creature, letting you perform some breathtaking skydives. The thrill that comes with finding and flying an Ikran in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora makes having this mount the best way to travel around the gorgeous open-world.
