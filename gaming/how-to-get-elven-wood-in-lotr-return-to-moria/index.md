## Literature Review

One of the most important resources to get in LOTR: Return to Moria is Elven Wood, which can be used to craft various upgrades and important tools.





Many sources of Elven Wood do not regenerate over time, meaning that you only have a limited number of projects for which you can use the material. You may have to choose to build a certain tool with the Wood, repair a weapon in LotR: Return to Moria, or simply not craft something that you might not need right away. Make sure to check your Inventory often to see if the collected Elven Wood you have is dwindling at any point during your journey.

 How To Find Elven Wood in LOTR: Return to Moria 
          

All the Elven Wood in LotR: Return to Moria can be found in the Elven Quarterarea, a place you can visit when you travel down around 220 fathoms underground. This location is hard to miss, with tons of resplendent trees dotting the landscape that looks unique compared to everything you&#39;ve seen. There are even fewer enemies in the Quarter compared to the dark caverns you explored earlier in the game.

There are two ways to get Elven Wood here, either by finding it in veins scattered along the ground or by chopping down the trees around the Quarter. Many resources in LotR: Return to Moria are found on the ground, with the Wood being no exception. Simply walking around should allow you to collect much of the material without much effort.






Taking an axe to any of the trees in the large forest of the Elven Quarter will easily net you a few pieces of Elven Wood every time.




While it may seem depressing to rid this area of its beautiful pieces of nature, you will need all the Wood you can harvest. As of this time of writing, it is unclear if you can plant any new trees from the Quarter or if they grow back on their own to replenish your source of the material in LotR: Return to Moria.

Once you gather all the Elven Wood you can get, store it somewhere safe where you won&#39;t lose this finite resource in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria for future crafting projects.
