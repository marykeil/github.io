## Literature Review

The most important currency in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC are Blueberry Points, or BP, that you can earn fast in a few different ways.





You can spend BP on League Club quests to summon new Pokémon into the four biomes near Blueberry Academy. If you spend 12,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of these zones, you can cause starter Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC to show up as well. Gaining enough BP can be difficult, but those who pay attention to their quests might realize how they might get the right amount.






Special coaches, or powerful trainers, can also be summoned to The Indigo Disk DLC when you spend 4,600 BP to invite them. Even without factoring items you can buy with BP, this creates a total of 16,600 to unlock the most important parts of the expanded content.

 How to Quickly Farm BP in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC 
          

The fastest way to farm BP in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is to team up with friends in a Union Circle to complete BP quests, and defeat every optional trainer. Rival Pokémon trainers do not challenge you unless you actively agree to start a battle. An NPC in the Rest Stop area will give you BP as a reward for victory, but only when you beat multiple trainers in a biome.




Union Circles are created from the Poké Portal menu, and allow you to combine BP quests with all the friends that join in this multiplayer space. The tasks presented to your character are simple; they ask you to catch Pokémon of a certain type, auto-battle, or several other straightforward objectives. You can quickly earn 10-30 BP for each of these goals in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.

This goal typically gives you 100 BP or more when you complete a slightly harder task. Cycling through red quests is by far the fastest way to earn BP in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet because of this substantial reward.
