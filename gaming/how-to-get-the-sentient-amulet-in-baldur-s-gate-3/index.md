During Act One, you will reach the Grymforge region while exploring the Underdark. Here, you will need to resolve a conflict between the people of Emerald Grove and Goblins. You can deal with the Goblins by poisoning their Party in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which will lead you to explore the Underdark, thanks to Halsin&#39;s advice. This is a tough location to explore, and you must ensure your party is strong enough to handle what awaits them.




                  The Best Party Compositions In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Having a strong party makes all the difference in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Players can assemble parties suited for combat, exploration, or a balance of both.

You can find the Sentient Amulet in a locked chest in the Adamantine Forge. The location of the chest is on a rocky platform at coordinates -624, 224. Be careful as you explore the Adamantine Forge, as your party needs to be well-balanced and have the necessary abilities to deal with enemies. 

          




The lava in this area is a significant hazard, as it’s extremely volatile and will deal a lot of damage to your health. To cool it down somewhat, you should beat the Lava Elemental that roams this area. This stops the lava from erupting, making it much easier to cross the dangerous terrain. One of the best tips is to keep an eye out for environmental details like this, as they can really make a difference when it comes to exploration and combat. Since the chest that contains the Sentient Amulet is locked, you can pick the lock if you have enough Dexterity.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: How To Find (&amp; Use) The Adamantine Forge   To explore the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the party must find a safe route, and locate gear molds and Mithral Ore to craft Adamantine gear.   

The locked chest requires a skill check of 20 or more, so if you have a Rogue with the right build in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you might be able to pick the lock easily. Alternatively, you can loot a nearby skeleton for the key. However, before picking up the Sentient Amulet, you should be aware of the consequences. 






 What To Do With The Sentient Amulet In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

Once you pick up the Sentient Amulet, the spirit of the Cursed Monk suddenly appears, who cannot stop laughing. You will need to pass a Wisdom check so your character doesn&#39;t get carried away and get the urge to laugh. It is imperative that your character doesn&#39;t start laughing, as you will fall victim to the same curse as the monk.

If you resist, they can opt to ask the monk spirit more questions, use Insight to find the spirit’s intentions aren’t hostile, or use Investigation to examine the amulet more closely. Those who don’t have these special skills should get Baldur’s Gate 3’s best companions to speak with the spirit.



Passing the Investigation skill check adds a Religion check; players can pass it to establish that the monk is a disciple of Lathander, god of dawn and renewal. If present, Shadowheart will urge the player to leave it.







The spirit of the monk will ask you to deliver the Sentient Amulet to his granddaughter at Wyrm’s Crossing. You can opt to equip the amulet, which grants them the Shatter spell, Ki Restoration, and the chance to converse with the spirit, stow it in their inventory, or toss it aside.

According to Fextralife, you won’t be able to grant the monk’s request until they visit Baldur’s Gate. In the meantime, it’s unclear whether carrying the Sentient Amulet has any positive or negative effects. Baldur’s Gate 3 players should proceed with caution when deciding whether to help the laughing monk.
