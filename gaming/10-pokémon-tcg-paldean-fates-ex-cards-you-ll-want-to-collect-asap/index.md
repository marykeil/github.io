## Literature Review

The Paldean Fates expansion for Pokémon TCG is full of noteworthy cards. Here are some of the best and most beautiful ones in the entire set.




Players and collectors will have several Paldean Fates ex cards from Pokémon TCG to grab once the set is available. The new Paldean Fates expansion is part of the larger Scarlet and Violet collection. Unlike other sets in the same era, however, this new set is focused on Shiny Pokémon from Scarlet and Violet. In a sense, it is somewhat of an equivalent to Pokémon TCG’s Sword and Shield: Shining Fates. The main feature is cards featuring Shiny Pokémon, though there are still regular cards in the mix, along with Supporter cards. Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates’s release date is set for January 26, 2024.
However, the Japanese equivalent to the set, named Shiny Treasure ex, has already been released in Japan. This allows players to get a taste of what they can expect once the expansion arrives in the West. There are several appealing cards in the set, most of which have a high rarity rating. Nonetheless, there are also less rare cards that can also strike a chord with collectors and players. The best and most beautiful cards in the expansion will likely overlap with some of the most expensive ones, much like it has already overlapped with some of the best Shiny cards in Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates.
            
 
 Everything Included In The Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates Elite Trainer Box 
The Paldean Fates Elite Trainer Box has a number of key inclusions to make it easy to jump into the next expansion of the Pokémon Trading Card Game.












 








 10  Nemona 
Rarity: Special Illustration Rare


 







Nemona is one of the best characters in Paldea, and she leaves a mark in the new Special Illustration Rare version of her own card in the Paldean Fates expansion for Pokémon TCG. The outgoing Trainer has occasional bursts of seriousness, especially when set up with a challenging fight.
This is perfectly captured by the artwork featured in Nemona’s card, as featured on PokéBeach. The character’s eyes transpire determination as she throws a perfectly centered Poké Ball. Nemona is accompanied by her faithful Pawmi, who also looks ready for a battle.





 9  Iono 
Rarity: Special Illustration Rare
        

One of the best-looking cards in the collection is the Special Illustration Rare version of the Supporter - Trainer card, Iono. Not only does the artwork feature one of the most beloved Trainers from the region of Paldea, but it does so in style. Iono and her outgoing online personality are boasted front and center.
The art gains special value when considering how many Pokémon are surrounding Iono. Around her are her Pokémon, like Wattrel, Luxio, Bellibolt, and Mismagius. The artwork in Iono’s Special Illustration Rare in Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates passes an air of calm and fun, which is precisely what the Trainer is about.





 8  Pawmi 
Rarity: Illustration Rare
        

After the two Trainer cards, one of the nicest pieces in the expansion is the Illustration Rare version of Pawmi. This special card features a group of Pawmi taking an afternoon nap under gentle sunlight and the protection of a broken tree trunk. Amidst the shower of orange stands a singular pink Shiny Pawmi.
The Shiny Pawmi is the only one that is still awake but seems like it will doze off along with its companions very shortly. The artwork on this Illustration Rare card in Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates is exquisite and heartwarming. Even if it does not have too much competitive value, it is easily one of the most desirable ones in the set.





 7  Gardevoir ex 
Rarity: Special Illustration Rare
        

The Special Illustration Rare version of Gardevoir ex is a unique card. This piece highlights a beautifully illustrated Shiny Gardevoir. This creature seems at peace, gently dancing in the forest. The Pokémon is not the only highlight, though. The entire ensemble around Shiny Gardevoir’s dance is well-detailed.
There is a group of Pachirisu gently sleeping in a bundle in the bushes, while a curious Wooper looks at Gardevoir from afar, in the nearby body of water. There are sparkles that accompany the Shiny Pokémon, making Gardevoir ex a truly magical card in Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates.





 6  Koraidon ex 
Rarity: Hyper Rare


 







One card that should definitely be on players’ radars is the Hyper Rare version of Koraidon ex. While the card does not have a unique and alternative illustration per si, it does boast a golden-hued version of the mascot legendary in Pokémon Scarlet.
Reflecting its Hyper Rare status, this will be a hard card to obtain, but one that is worth pulling for in boosters simply due to its status. Being able to showcase a completely golden-colored Koraidon in a deck or collection is one of the benefits of the Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates expansion.





 5  Miraidon ex 
Rarity: Hyper Rare
        

Similarly, the Hyper Rare version of Miraidon ex is something to keep an eye out for, especially for players and collectors who prefer Pokémon Violet’s Legendary mascot over the one featured in Pokémon Scarlet. Miraidon ex is completely bathed in gold and is an eye-grabbing card.
Its rarity is also quite high, but that is one of the factors that gives this card so much value. Even if it dispenses a unique and exquisite illustration, opting for a gilded treatment of a standard full art, Miraidon ex is a card from Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates that is worth grabbing.





 4  Mimikyu 
Rarity: Illustration Rare
        

The Illustration Rare version of Mimikyu is an absolute delight and one of the most remarkable cards in the upcoming TCG expansion. The fan-favorite Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon is seen relaxing while atop a quilt, as a human knits next to it. This card gains even more value when considering the fact that this Mimikyu is Shiny.
Even though its body seems to be slightly yellowish, thanks to the surrounding lighting, it is possible to see that Mimikyu is Shiny due to the lack of coloration in its mask’s cheeks. Regular Mimikyu has rose-colored cheeks, while the Shiny version, highlighted in the Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates card, has black cheeks on its gray body.





 3  Palafin 
Rarity: Illustration Rare
        

Possibly the most notable card in the entire collection, the Illustration Rare version of Palafin is going to be a highly sought piece from the upcoming set. The full art showcases a Shiny Palafin in its Hero Form, posing like the ruler of its species.
Behind it are other Palafin and Finizen swimming regularly, but Shiny Palafin stands out with its muscular build, intense eyes, and lighting that truly makes it look like a superhero. This card’s rarity and gameplay value are not too high, but its illustration alone makes it one of the most precious cards in the Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates set.





 2  Mew ex 
Rarity: Special Illustration Rare
        

The leaked Shiny Mew Pokémon TCG card was an instant success when it was first seen, and there is a reason as to why. The Special Illustration Rare version of Mew ex features a heartwarming art of a blue Mew playing around in a bubble, while other cutely drawn Pokémon observe it.
The artwork carries the signature style of the artist known as USGMEN, which focuses on simple tracing and coloring to provide a unique piece of art. Combining its rarity, its gameplay value as an ex card, the exquisite artwork, and the fact that this is a Shiny Mew rather than a regular one, this will undoubtedly be one of the most sought cards in Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates.





 1  Charizard ex 
Rarity: Special Illustration Rare


 







The most precious of cards in the set is the Special Illustration Rare version of Charizard ex. Charizard cards in Pokémon TCG traditionally have a lot of value with it being one of the most popular creatures in the franchise. When this important factor is combined with the fact that Charizard ex is a Special Illustration Rare that features a valuable black-colored Shiny Charizard, it is likely that this piece will be worth a lot of money.
The artwork on Charizard ex’s card is fantastic, featuring a Terastallized Dark Tera Type Charizard with a lot of firepower. The crystalline effect all around the card with the black Charizard front and center will certainly make this the most sought-after card in Pokémon TCG’s new Paldean Fates expansion.
