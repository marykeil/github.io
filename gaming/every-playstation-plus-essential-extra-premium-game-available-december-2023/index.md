## Literature Review

The new batch of PlayStation Plus games for December 2023 has been revealed by Sony. Here&#39;s the official lineup and what it has to offer.




Sony has announced the full lineup of PlayStation Plus games for December 2023, providing a fresh new selection of games for subscribers to access in the near future. The PS Plus service offers general access to online multiplayer features on the PS4 and PS5, but the library of games that the service makes available might be an even bigger draw for some users. Every month brings a new rotation of Essential games that can be added to an account to keep as long as a subscription is active, so there&#39;s no rush to actually play the titles before they depart.




PlayStation Plus features three separate subscription tiers, starting with the Essential option that grants access to basic online services and the monthly rotating selection. Extra and Premium add a larger library that doesn&#39;t cycle out at a regular pace, making an upgraded subscription an appealing possibility for anyone who wants a huge selection of games at their fingertips. The Essential titles are available across all tiers, typically representing a variety of genres and styles to ensure a reasonably diverse monthly experience.

                  What Is PlayStation Portal? (PS5 Handheld Accessory Explained)   The PlayStation Portal is described as a “remote player,” but it’s difficult to understand what that might mean. Here’s a comprehensive guide.

The official PlayStation Blog has revealed the lineup of Essential titles for December 2023 with a post outlining a basic overview of each of the three games that will be available for the period. The roster for the month consists of LEGO 2K Drive, PowerWash Simulator, and Sable, which can be redeemed for free from December 5, 2023 to January 1, 2024. The November PlayStation Plus lineup departed on December 4 to make way for the new wave of games. A follow-up PlayStation Blog post revealed the PS4 and PS5 games coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, as well as the classic titles available exclusively to those who subscribe to PS Plus Premium.

 PlayStation Plus Essential  PlayStation Plus Extra  PlayStation Plus Premium   LEGO 2K Drive   PowerWash Simulator   Sable     Grand Theft Auto 5   Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin   MotoGP 23   Metal: Hellsinger   Salt and Sacrifice   Moonscars   Mega Man 11   Gigabash   Grime   Tinykin   Prodeus   Shadowrun Returns   Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director&#39;s Cut   Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition     Mega Man Legacy Collection   Mega Man Legacy Collection 2   Thrillville   Thrillville: Off the Rails   Buzz Lightyear of Star Command   






Grand Theft Auto 5, one of the best-selling games of all time, is certainly the highlight of the December 2023 PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium offerings, and comes on the heels of the first trailer releasing for Grand Theft Auto 6. Although slightly more niche, the three Shadowrun games is notable for potentially enticing those who have been enjoying Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. All three of those CRPGs can typically be bought together as the Shadowrun Trilogy, but having them all available at no extra cost my interest those just getting in to the genre.



 Different Speeds In December&#39;s PS Plus Games Lineup 
          

The obvious high-octane option among the December lineup of PlayStation Plus Essential games is LEGO 2K Drive, which focuses on a cartoon brand of racing action. The game capitalizes on the LEGO concept to deliver transforming vehicles that can be custom-built or downloaded from other creators, with destructible environmental elements providing a nice bonus. Unlike the multiplayer-focused experiences of many karting titles, LEGO 2K Drive accompanies its multiplayer possibilities with a story mode in the creative world of Bricklandia for single-player or split-screen co-op entertainment.




                  LEGO 2K Drive Review: A Smashing Driving Adventure   LEGO 2K Drive is an addictive and cheerful take on racing games with lots of quests to do, collectibles to find, and even more laughs to be had.    

PowerWash Simulator is a game built around the satisfaction of cleaning up dirty objects and environments to look sparkly and new, turning a menial task into potentially engaging gameplay. From suburban houses to unearthed monuments, there&#39;s no shortage of work to take on for the intrepid power washer. The open-world experience of Sable can be similarly meditative, but the unique art style and exploration-focused progression make for a very different experience overall. LEGO 2K Drive and Power Wash Simulator are available on both PS4 and PS5, while Sable is the one PlayStation Plus December addition that requires a PS5 to play.
