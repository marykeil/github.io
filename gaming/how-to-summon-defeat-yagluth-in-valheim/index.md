## Literature Review

The final boss in the Early Access version of Valheim is Yagluth, a terrifying skeleton missing the lower half of his body. Here&#39;s how to beat him.





To summon Yagluth, players will need to obtain totems and place them on Yagluth&#39;s summoning stone in the Plains biome. Though he moves slowly thanks to his lack of lower limbs, his attacks are earth- and fire-based and can be devastating if players are not careful. The best way to defeat him will involve watching for his telegraphs and equipping all the best endgame gear players can get their hands on.




                  The Best Seeds For Valheim On Xbox   Now that Valheim has come to Xbox, players can use the best known seeds to shape their world&#39;s generation to suit their interests before starting.   


 Summoning Yagluth 
          

Players will need to collect five Fuling totems as a sacrifice to summon Yagluth. Fuling totems are a guaranteed drop from defeated Fuling Shamans on the Plains. Unfortunately, Fuling Shamans are less common than other subcategories of Fuling, so players will need to do some searching to find and defeat these goblinoid creatures.

Like the summoning stones for the other bosses, players are likely to stumble across the location of Yagluth&#39;s summoning stone by accident, but they can also find a runestone in the Plains biome directing them to the stone. Players will find the summoning stone surrounded by a circle of giant stone pillars meant to look like the fingers of a skeletal hand.






You will need to place the totems in each of the five circles on the summoning stone in the &#34;palm&#34; of the giant stone hand. To complete the sacrifice, use the red tablet in front of the summoning stone, which will bring forth the boss.






 Fighting Yagluth 
          

Prior to summoning Yagluth, equip your best armor, good options include the Wolf Armor set or Padded Armor Set. You will also want a good shield, and it may be a good idea to practice blocking and parrying ahead of time.

                  Valheim: How To Get Black Cores (&amp; What Theyâ€™re For)   To get Black Cores for crafting high-end workstations in Valheim, players must venture into the Mistlands in search of the biome&#39;s dangerous Dungeons.   

Yagluth has the potential to one- or two-shot a player with its strong attacks, so a large health pool is important as well. Stack as many buffs as you can by eating a hearty meal of cooked recipes. The best food combination for the largest health pool and a decent stamina pool is Blood Pudding, Lox Meat Pie, and Serpent Stew. This will offer 250 Health, 210 Stamina, and 12 Healing per Tick.




Like the other Valheim bosses, Yagluth has three main attacks he can use in any order. Thankfully, all three have obvious telegraphs that can help players dodge and avoid being blasted by earth or fire. Yagluth&#39;s attacks are:

 Atttack  Description   Explosion  Ygluth&#39;s fist will glow blue, then slam down onto the ground, creating a miniature explosion. Anyone in the blast radius will take damage.   Meteor  Yagluth&#39;s fist will glow reddish-orange, then slam down onto the ground, causing a meteor to fall from above. It will create an explosion where it lands. Players hit by the meteor will take regular damage in addition to a fire debuff. Taking cover can prevent being hit by the stone.   Fire Breath  Yagluth rears back his head, breathes fire straight ahead, and turns to cover some distance. This attack has range but can be dodged by sidestepping or using a decent shield.   



          

Yagluth&#39;s attacks are strong, but he moves slowly and has more difficulty hitting players at range. For this fight, it may be best to bring a strong bow and arrows that deal pure damage, like the Needle Arrows or Obsidian Arrows. Players more comfortable with melee fighting may have a more difficult time with this boss, as getting close can mean certain death. These players should bring Black Metal spears or daggers if they have any. These weapons are easier to use while in constant motion, which is necessary when trying to melee this boss.




When taking on Yagluth solo, players will either want to rain a hail of arrows on this boss while keeping their distance to avoid his stronger attacks and take advantage of his lack of speed, or use a hit-and-run melee tactic by whacking the boss in the back a few times and dashing away before he can counterstrike.

In a co-op, players will stand a better chance as several Vikings can strike at once while Yagluth is focused on a single target, which will allow the team to deal damage even as he strikes. This is especially true of his fire breath attack, which can only attack one player at a time. That player can dodge while the others focus on melee and ranged attacks to his backside.

Once Yagluth is defeated, players will earn his trophy, the Forsaken ability, and some Torn Spirit. Place the Yagluth trophy in the circle, and this will complete the last Sacrificial Stone. in Valheim.
