## Literature Review

The Pokemon Kubfu in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC can evolve into two different forms of Urshifu depending on the item you give it.





You can evolve two types of Urshifu from Kubfu: Single Strike Style Urshifu or Rapid Strike Style Urshifu. The Scroll of Darkness item turns Kubfu into the Single Strike variant, and the Scroll of Waters creates the Rapid Strike version. Ordinarily, these Scrolls were obtained through Battle Towers, but there is a different method for getting them in the DLC for Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet.






You can catch a Kubfu for evolution by completing 10 solo Blueberry quests in The Indigo Disk DLC, then getting a Kubfu Treat to lure the Pokémon to the Fury Falls area of the map.




                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 How To Get The Scroll of Darkness For Evolving Kubfu (Dark-/Fighting-Type) 
          

The Scroll of Darkness can be bought at the auction marketplace of Porto Marinada in Area Two of the West Province of the Paldea Region. Buying The Indigo Disk DLC puts the Scroll in a special auction you can attend if you have Kubfu on your team. The object sold at Porto Marinada is random, but you have a better chance of encountering the Scroll if you have a Kubfu in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.




Make sure you have enough money to purchase the Scroll of Darkness, then use it on Kubfu to evolve the Pokémon into a Dark-/Fighting-type Urshifu. This single-strike style Urshifu can be beneficial against the strongest trainers in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC Final Boss &amp; Ending Explained (In Detail)   Both the final boss encounter and ending of the Indigo Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are shocking. Here&#39;s everything that happens in detail.   



 How To Get The Scroll of Waters For Evolving Kubfu (Water-/Fighting-Type) 
          

The Scroll of Waters is also found at the Porto Marinada auction in the same way as the Scroll of Darkness in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Once again, it would help to have Kubfu in your active party to increase the likelihood of either Scroll&#39;s appearance. The Rapid Strike Style Water-/Fighting-type Urshifu that evolves from the Scroll of Waters is a Legendary Pokémon that can easily defeat many opponents.






Rapid Strike Style Urshifu is usually considered better than the Single Strike Style variant because of the Water-type&#39;s Unseen Fist ability. This trait lets Urshifu&#39;s moves hit through Protect or Detect, allowing you to always attack another Pokémon.




Those that evolve Kubfu into either form of Urshifu will have an influential team member in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC that has the skills to challenge even the toughest trainers.
