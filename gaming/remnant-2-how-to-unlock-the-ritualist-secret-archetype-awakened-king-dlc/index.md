## Literature Review

A secret character archetype called The Ritualist can be unlocked in Remnant 2&#39;s Awakened King DLC by finding a hidden item in a new area of Losomn.





When you try to unlock the Ritualist, you should have a character enter Adventure Mode through The Awakened King DLC as a &#34;One Shot.&#34; This allows you to find the right items tied to the class, without fully committing to a campaign run through the expanded content. Also, you can use one of the best archetype builds in Remnant 2 you&#39;ve already created here to defeat enemies and get the secret class quickly.




                  Everything Players Loved But Bigger - Remnant 2: The Awakened King DLC Preview   The first major DLC for Remnant 2 promises more of what players love, with new epic bosses, an upgraded level generator, and additional story content.   


 How to Get the Ritualist Archetype in Remnant 2 
          

To unlock the Ritualist archetype, you need to find the Ragged Poppet item and bring it back to Wallace in Ward 13, so he can upgrade it into a Cursed Effigy. Since area locations in Remnant 2 are randomized, it can be difficult to track down this rare object. Thankfully, you should be able to identify different landmarks hosting the Poppet around the Losomn region that always appears in an Adventure Mode run.

The Poppet shows up in a place named the Drowned Wen, a section of Losomn on the Forlorn Coast that you may come across as you expand your map. You&#39;ll know when your character is at this location when you see two connected rowboats underneath the docks leading toward a dirt path in an opening in the walls here. Watch out for various enemies in Remnant 2 that could surprise you in this smaller area.






The Ritualist has massive Area of Effect (AoE) abilities that also apply negative status effects in Remnant 2 to your enemies, with the Prime Perk Vile letting you deal more damage to afflicted enemies for a ridiculous amount of DPS.




Jump along the boats to reach the path, then follow the trail until you come across a ritual chamber where a Witch is about to sacrifice a Hog. Stop the ritual by killing the Witch, then retrieve the Ragged Poppet from behind the stakes planted in this cave. Once you travel back to Ward 13 and hand the Poppet over to Wallace, he can craft the Cursed Effigy and give you access to the Ritualist class in Remnant 2.

Once you unlock the Ritualist archetype in Remnant 2, you can exit out of The Awakened King DLC Adventure Mode run to create a new character with this archetype to fully explore the game&#39;s new campaign story.
