## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.1 update will add a lot of changes to the game, including a metro system, accessibility features, car chases, and much more.




CD Projekt Red surprised with the announcement of a new, unexpected, Update 2.1 coming to Cyberpunk 2077 on December 5, 2023, whichs adds an amazing number of new features and updates to the game. After earlier reports that September&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC and massive 2.0 update would be the last major changes the game would see as devs moved on to work on Cyberpunk&#39;s Project Orion sequel and the next Witcher game, this patch 2.1 is a pleasant surprise. The update includes many needed changes for accessibility features, but also many content updates for vehicles and the long-awaited metro system.




Update 2.1 for Cyberpunk 2077 was detailed during a livestream with developers from CD Projekt Red on December 1, 2023, and will arrive just days later. Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 patch will be available on December 5, the same day the Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 hits the stores. With this update, V will finally be able to enjoy a scenic ride on the NCART metro line while listening to their favorite tunes, on their way to hang out with their romantic partner or enter one of the now-replayable car races added to the game.

 Every New Content Features Included In Cyberpunk 2077 2.1 
         

The most notable addition with update 2.1, revealed via the CD Projekt Red Twitch channel, is the new metro system that Cyberpunk 2077 is finally adding to the game. The metro has made frequent appearances in many trailers since long before the game&#39;s release and recent trailers for Phantom Liberty, which caused CD Projekt Red to receive frequent requests for the feature to be added. While the new metro system will still be able to be used as fast travel, V can now enjoy scenic rides through Night City on five separate operating metro lines connecting to 19 stations.




Many other features have been included in the 2.1 update, with the option to replay car races after finishing Claire&#39;s quests, many changes to motorcycle driving, hangouts with romance partners, and much more:

 Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 New Content   Night City Area Rapid Transit (NCART) metro system, with 19 metro stations (metro stations can still be used as fast travel points)   Radioport cyberware to listen to radio stations while on foot   Improved boss fights   Replayable car races that provide money and discounts on new vehicles   Several new cars and motorcycles, including an open-top Porsche   Improved combat on motorcycles, allowing V to throw knives and axes while riding   New motorcycle maneuvers – wheelies, tricks, leans   Enemy gangs will pursue V after certain gigs, including in all-new car chases   Hangouts with romantic partners   New accessibility features   






Although a portable Radioport may seem like a small addition, being able to listen to V&#39;s favorite radio stations while walking around Night City doing quests can add a lot of pleasure and is a practical addition. The Radioport will have an adjustable volume control separate from other game volume, and will be disabled automatically during key conversations and combat music.



 Accessibility &amp; Quality Of Life Changes In Update 2.1 
          

For many players, the accessibility features that Update 2.1 brings to Cyberpunk 2077 will be a complete game-changing experience. These are items that have been sorely needed, and yet, were no longer expected. Everyone may find some benefit with things like text size and aim assists. The new accessibility tab will be automatically added to the game with Update 2.1, and are coming in addition to all features currently available. This dedicated menu for Accessibility features will make many aspects of the game more enjoyable for many players and is a positive step towards inclusivity.




 Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 New Accessibility Options   Three colorblind modes – Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia   Subtitle options for cinematic, radio, and overhead, including adding background conversations above NPCs&#39; heads   Text size adjustment   Text background opacity adjustment   Aim assists for melee (three levels of varying assist), vehicle (on or off), and ranged combat (four levels of varying assist)   Additional camera settings to reduce motion sickness – reduced secondary camera movements, and optional dot in the center of the screen   Vibration level adjustment   Toggle for applying weapon sway while aiming to the camera or weapon   Toggle to disable haptic feedback   



                  Cyberpunk 2077 Releases New Content, But It&#39;s Not An Update   There&#39;s a new way to experience more of the Cyberpunk 2077 world of Night City, but it&#39;s not in the form of content added to the game itself.   






 No News On Any New Game Plus Mode 
          

Another large component that has been heavily requested for Cyberpunk 2077 is the addition of a New Game Plus mode to add even more replayability and challenge to the game. Sadly, there was no mention of this feature being added during the stream discussing Update 2.1. Now that the development focus is shifting to other projects, there is a slim chance of New Game Plus ever coming to Cyberpunk 2077 outside some creative modding.

Developers at CD Projekt Red were not expected to be adding anything new to the game after Update 2.0, other than small bug fixes and minor updates. This surprise drop announcement for Update 2.1 comes as a very pleasant surprise, particularly with the added accessibility features to the game and the new metro lines. This is likely to be the final content drop that Cyberpunk 2077 will receive, but the game appears to be going out with a bang.
