## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC are full of secret side missions and lore that is hidden away for players to stumble across while playing.




It is always fun to be able to come across some secret, hidden side jobs and events in a game like Cyberpunk 2077, and there are a lot of them tucked away in different nooks and crannies of Night City and Dogtown. Developers at CD Projekt Red seem to enjoy slipping even more in with each big update to the game, enticing people to explore anew with each change to fully experience all the details that have been tweaked. The game features a lot of lore and detailed backstories of various NPCs and events, and many of these extra narratives are uncovered only through seeking out these hidden surprises.
Many of the large updates to Cyberpunk 2077 have small lines in official patch notes stating things such as &#34;Added more secrets to be discovered by players in Night City.&#34; These hints serve to taunt people to get out and explore what may have been changed or added throughout the game without much direction as to where to go. Many of those who had previously completed the game have returned with the Phantom Liberty expansion and subsequent Update 2.0 and 2.1 changes and now can seek out some of these little events hidden around the virtual dystopia.

 10  Space Force One Crash Site 
Located In The Desert Area Of Dogtown
        

The crash of Space Force One is what sets off the events of the Phantom Liberty DLC content in Cyberpunk 2077, and it turns out there is more to the crash than just the smoking wreckage inside Dogtown. In the southeastern side of Dogtown there is a desert area much like the Badlands where V may find some Scavs checking out a crash site. After dealing with them, Johnny explains that the crashed Lifepod is the one that Songbird used to escape Space Force One. This then gives a little backstory regarding how Songbird survived, although no loot can be found there.





 9  Sandra Lore At A Murder Scene 
Located At The Solar Arrays In The Badlands
        

Out in the middle of the Solar Arrays in the Badlands, there is a Netwatch crime scene tucked away that has a dead body at its center. V is not seen as a threat when first approaching. However, if they can investigate deeper through either sneaking or just killing everyone involved, there is some loot as well as a lot of information about some of Sandra Dorsett&#39;s activities.


The above video from CraneGames on YouTube shows some of what can be found through killing the operatives and looting the area, including what information they have on Sandra.





 8  Secret Stash In The Train Tunnels 
Located In The Orbital Air Space Center
        

There is a secret location in the Orbital Air Space Center that can only be found during the Phantom Liberty expansion quest, &#34;The Killing Moon,&#34; and only if V chooses to help Songbird. It is a challenging thing to attempt, as it requires a lot of running and jumping through the train tunnel with very quick-moving trains; however, if one tries to go further down the tunnel beyond where the quest sends them, they come across the end of the line with a sign from devs telling players to turn around and go back. Below the sign is an Arcticombat Semi-Formal Button Up, some bubble gum, grenades, and Eddies.
            
 
 10 Secrets Most Players Never Discover in Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC 
Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC features a number of secret features, hidden details, and Easter eggs that most players will never discover.








 7  Arasaka Secret Duel Event 
Located Near Pinewood Junction, Kabuki


 







Near the Pinewood Junction fast travel point in Kabuki, an observant player might notice some bloodstains on the ground leading to an alleyway. Following the blood trail, there is a body of a deceased Arasaka agent with a sword stuck inside of it that cannot be pulled out. Following even more bloody prints leads to a second Arasaka operative who is dying and requests to be left alone. After he has passed, an archived conversation can be found on him, suggesting that the two perished in a duel.





 6  Coin Operated Boy 
Located In Megabuilding H8 In Japantown, Westbrook
        

Brendan is a talking S.C.S.M. vending machine found in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Night City who can offer V some interesting side quests alongside many cheesy jokes and strong opinions. These hidden side gigs have been around for quite a while, but any player who has not already done them should check them out. They are not the kinds of quests that will make a large difference to the game, but their light-hearted and somewhat random story can be a fun diversion from the darkness of the world in which Cyberpunk 2077 exists. Brendan can be found just outside Megabuilding H8 in the Westbrook district of Night City.

Out of all the side quests in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, V meeting an opinionated vending machine tops the cake for being the most comical.








 5  Iconic Achilles X-MOD2 Rifle Hidden In A Backroom 
Located In Dogtown Near The Heavy Hearts Club


 







In the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC, there is a hidden bedroom tucked away where none but the most curious of souls would find it. Inside a blue and white building near the Heavy Hearts Club, there are some stairs that lead to an upper floor where there is a bridge to another building, but if V passes the bridge and goes to what looks like a dead end, there is a secret passageway revealed. Eventually, there is a very depressing living area with an Iconic rifle, the Achilles X-MOD2, lying casually on the lower bunk of some bunk beds.





 4  Arcade Machine: Arasaka Tower 3D 
Located In A Church In The Badlands
        

Along with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s free 2.0 update was a brand-new arcade game for V to play around with, which stars none other than the beloved Johnny Silverhand himself. This playable Doom-like arcade game can be found in an abandoned church in the Badlands, north of the fast-travel point at the protein farm. The little game lets players reenact Johnny Silverhand&#39;s bombing of Arasaka Tower in full retro shooter glory and can be played in about ten minutes.





 3  Trauma Team Loot From Playing The Arcade Game Trauma Drama 
Trauma Drama Is Located In Bars Across Night City
        

Update 2.0 also introduced another arcade game called Trauma Drama to Cyberpunk 2077, which gives much more than just another fun minigame experience but provides actual rewards at its conclusion. If V can beat this side-scrolling shooter and set a high score, then they will get a text from the Trauma Team inviting them to join them. This then unlocks a hidden back room area of the Night City Medical Center in Watson, where V will get a special Trauma Team uniform and an interactive toy Trauma Team AV that can go into V&#39;s apartment.





 2  Hidden Location With An Iconic: BFC 9000 
Located In Rancho Coronado
        

Update 2.1 to Cyberpunk 2077 added the new Iconic one-handed club, BFC 9000, tucked away in a very remote, hidden location. In order to get to the club, V must scale the rocky cliff face near the Dam Viewpoint in Rancho Coronado. Far up on a rocky ledge, they will find Hugo Selvig and a crashed AV with a box of a special toy delivery spilled out of it. After killing Hugo, V can loot the BFC 9000 off of him.
The Iconic one-handed club, BFC 9000, has the appearance of something that is for adults only. 






 1  Trauma Team Shootout With Tyger Claws 
Located On The New Highway


 







Update 2.1 to Cyberpunk 2077 opened up a previously unusable Highway in Night City, but V isn&#39;t the first to find it. Shortly after pulling onto the highway from the Hanford Overpass, they will find a large shootout taking place between the Trauma Team and Tyger Claws. V can choose to ignore the whole encounter, kill everyone, or pick a side. As long as V doesn&#39;t ignore the situation, there is quite a bit of backstory and lore to be found through some of the shards discovered in the aftermath.
