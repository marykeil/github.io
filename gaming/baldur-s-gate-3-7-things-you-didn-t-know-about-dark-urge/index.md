## Literature Review

The Dark Urge in Baldur’s Gate 3 opens up a lot of option and details that are absent when choosing to play a custom-made character instead.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers a choice between existing Origin characters or a custom character at the start of the game. While this is one of the earliest decisions made in BG3, it&#39;s also among the most important. Specifically, the decision to choose certain Origins affects content, dialogue options, and even the gear that&#39;s available throughout the game&#39;s three acts. Choosing to play as the Dark Urge - a character halfway between entirely custom and an Origin option - is perhaps the most significant choice that can be made during character creation.
Now that Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has been released for a few months, some of its many secrets have been uncovered, along with how paths and storylines can vary depending on choices made earlier in the game. In particular, the choice to be the Dark Urge adds an entirely new story to the game, and it brings with it a variety of choices, items, and consequences that aren&#39;t seen with a custom Tav.
            
 
 One Origin Character Feels Like Baldur’s Gate 3’s Intended Main Character 
Baldur’s Gate 3 offers multiple Origin Characters for players to choose from, but one among them feels like it’s the intended main character.












 








 7  The Urge Questline 
Act 1 Though 3


 







Like the other Origin Charactions, the Dark Urge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has their own unique questlines, and that means quest rewards come with them. This in and of itself might not be unknown, but without playing the Dark Urge, it&#39;s easy to miss that the quest has two primary variations. The first is embracing the urges and reclaiming their position as Bhaal&#39;s golden child. And the second is rejecting Bhaal by overcoming the urges. Both of these options can lead to extra cutscenes and dialogue at the end.





 6  Slayer Form 
Obtainable In Act 2
        

Choosing to embrace the urges in Act 2 rewards the Dark Urge with the Slayer Form, which is a shape-shifting ability that looks like a demonic take on a Druid&#39;s Wild Shape. To get this reward, the Dark Urge needs to kill Isobel, which is an option when first meeting her that&#39;s unique to the Dark Urge. Considering the benefits that come with keeping Isobel alive and well, the Slayer Form&#39;s existence can be easily overlooked.
            
 
 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Should You Save Isobel Or Side With Marcus At The Last Light Inn? 
The Last Light Inn presents a major Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 choice, but between helping Isobel and Marcus, one option has far more advantages than the other.








 5  Taking Gale&#39;s Hand 
An Option In Act 1


 







When the Dark Urge comes across Gale&#39;s hand sticking out of the portal on the beach in Act 1, they have the unique option to fantasize about cutting off the hand. Unfortunately, this fantasy turns into reality and the Dark Urge will actually sever Gale&#39;s hand, killing him in the process. While having the hand can lead to unique dialogue options, it means missing out on having Gale in the party, and all the damage he can deal to enemies as a wizard.
            
 
 One Early BG3 Dark Urge Decision Completely Kills Off A Key Origin Character 
It&#39;s easy to let impulses win when playing as the Dark Urge, but one seemingly flippant choice can have shockingly large consequences later on.








 4  Mind Flayer Pod 
Seen In Act 2
        

The last portion of Act 2 takes place in a Mind Flayer Colony located under Moonrise Towers. Beyond the room of pods where Zevlor is located, if the party didn&#39;t kill the Tieflings in Act 1, there&#39;s a pod with Mizora in it. And next to her, the Dark Urge finds a broken pod that brings back memories when it&#39;s interacted with, although how much of those memories they see depends on a few dice rolls. Astarion is able to confirm that the Dark Urge&#39;s blood is in that broken pod, and the revelation means that they were infected with a tadpole long before the game&#39;s opening sequence.





 3  Bhaalspawn Body 
Seen In Act 3


 







Without the Dark Urge in the party, there&#39;s a body in the Bhaal Temple that is labeled as a Fallen Bhaalspawn. However, when the Dark Urge is present, this body isn&#39;t in the temple. Considering the Dark Urge&#39;s past and questline, it could be assumed that in a timeline without them, Orin successfully defeats her competitor and takes their place as Bhaal&#39;s Chosen without fear that she&#39;ll be challenged for her position again.





 2  Timber The Squirrel 
Found In Act 1
        

The Druid Grove is full of unique opportunities for the Dark Urge to interact with the world in ways that aren&#39;t an option for other characters. However, that isn&#39;t always a good thing, unless the party wants to take an evil path and doesn&#39;t even care for the adorable animals of the Grove. A few interactions here that are more known include the Dark Urge&#39;s option to torture the bird Nettie was curing, and possibly using non-lethal damage to knock out Alfira and avoid her arriving at camp, which seals her death with the Dark Urge.
Timber is a squirrel and can be harder to find due to its size. Around the elevators, the party can interact with Timber. But if the Dark Urge is present without speak with animals being active, then they&#39;ll kick Timber into a tree without warning, effectively killing it. Unlike many of the other unique moments with the Dark Urge, there isn&#39;t an option here on what to do and no dice rolls. Talking with Timber without speak with animals is a death sentence for this little squirrel when the Dark Urge is around.





 1  Betray Bhaal Ending 
Seen In Act 3
        

This ending requires a few steps to be taken beforehand, and as such, it can easily end up being missed. First, in the Temple of Bhaal, after dueling Orin, a cutscene plays where Bhaal offers the Dark Urge a gift. This is one of the final parts of the questline, and the options here are to reject Bhaal and redeem themselves from the urges, or accept Bhaal and his gift on the condition that they&#39;ll control the Elder Brain and kill people in Bhaal&#39;s name. However, the Dark Urge can choose to accept Bhaal&#39;s gift, but defeat the Elder Brain in the end anyway.
That course of actions leads to a unique cutscene playing at the end, after the party has gone their separate ways at the docks. The Dark Urge, although seemingly enjoying a moment of freedom, is visibly taken over by Bhaal because they didn&#39;t break their bond with him when they had the chance and went against his orders. One of Orin&#39;s iconic blades appears in the Dark Urge&#39;s hand, and they walk away to presumably begin another killing spree.
The abundance of choices and secrets scattered throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 makes replaying the game again a new experience each time. And yet, it seems like no matter how many times the party sets off on their adventure and makes it to Baldur&#39;s Gate, there&#39;s content and details that haven&#39;t been seen. Niche and largely unknown details aren&#39;t unique to the Dark Urge, but trying different origins opens up new options in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
