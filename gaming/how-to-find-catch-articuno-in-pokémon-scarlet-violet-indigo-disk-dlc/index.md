## Literature Review

Articuno is one of the three Legendary birds of the Kanto region. Trainers can catch this Pokémon after the Indigo Disk DLC in Scarlet and Violet.





As more types have continued to be added to the franchise, the Ice-type has progressively weakened defensively. Currently, there are four weaknesses and only one resistance. However, Generation 9 has replaced the move Hail with Snowscape, which creates a snowstorm and raises the defense of Ice-type Pokémon by 50%. Articuno has always been a strong Legendary, but it is now even better. Additionally, trainers can Terastallize in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to increase their chances of winning a battle. The first step to finding Articuno is talking to Snacksworth at the Blueberry Academy.




                  Every Scarlet &amp; Violet Version Exclusive In Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC doubles the number of version exclusives compared to The Teal Mask, and it&#39;s helpful to know the full list.   


 How To Catch Articuno In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk 
          

Articuno and many other Legendary Pokémon will only appear after completing the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk&#39;s story. This is because you will need to talk to a new NPC named Snacksworth, who will not normally be present. He is near the entrance of Blueberry Academy and offers a random snack for each Legendary Pokémon and a hint of where to find them. However, Snacksworth will do this once for every 10 Blueberry Academy quests trainers have completed. The issue of obtaining the incorrect treat can be circumvented by simply relaunching the game before the conversation ends.




          

After obtaining the Articuno Treat, fly back to the Paldea Region and head to the Glaseado Mountains. Travel west from Montenevera until you reach a small lake with a waterfall.
