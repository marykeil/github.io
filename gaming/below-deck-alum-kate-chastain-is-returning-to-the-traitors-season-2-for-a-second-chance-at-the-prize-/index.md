## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 is welcoming back a ghost from the prior season in Below Deck&#39;s Kate Chastain, who will be returning to the game once again.




The Traitors US season 2 may have just gotten started, but the game is changing in the coming weeks as Below Deck star Kate Chastain will be returning to host Alan Cumming&#39;s castle in the Scottish highlands to take another crack at the game. After playing through the game as a faithful, The Traitors US season 1&#39;s Kate was banished just before the end of the game, leaving Survivor legend and Big Brother 25 houseguest Cirie Fields to win the game. Though Kate wasn&#39;t able to make it to the end of the game during her first time on the series, fans enjoyed her no-nonsense presence on the show.




The Traitors US season 2 shared two surprise cast members will be joining the series in upcoming episodes, including Kate in her return to the series. The Below Deck star revealed to People that she&#39;ll be back to play the game for a second time. &#34;What makes my return to The Traitors so exciting is that no one saw it coming...myself included,&#34; she shared, explaining there was no hesitation when she was asked to return. &#34;I was willing to give it another go because I knew the cast this year was stacked with so many big, fun personalities,&#34; Kate explained.


 Kate&#39;s Episodes Of The Traitors US Start On January 25 
          

While The Traitors US season 2 cast is just getting started on deciding who they think is a traitor among their group of faithful, Kate won&#39;t be joining in until January 25 on The Traitors US season 2 episode 5. After the first trio of episodes, the traitors are in a tricky spot. With Big Brother&#39;s Dan Gheesling already being suspected by some of the faithful, his fellow traitors Married To Medicine Phaedra Parks and Survivor&#39;s Parvati Shallow have a ton of slack to pick up in getting his name cleared. Dan spent the most recent round table explaining where he was coming from, but he may be in trouble.





 

Within the first several episodes, the group of traitors has already chosen to murder Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio and Marcus Jordan, while the larger cast has banished RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race star Peppermint and Dancing With The Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy. While the traitors are working hard to eliminate the faithful who have the lowest chances of getting sussed out, their strategies may be more than clear to veteran player Kate. After getting duped throughout the entire season by Cirie, Kate will be on high alert coming back into The Traitors US season 2.

Though her time on The Traitors US won&#39;t start for a couple of episodes, it&#39;s clear that Kate will be working hard in whichever role she&#39;s given, either as a traitor or a faithful. Kate&#39;s time on the series will be interesting, though many believe that she may not last long with the cast of The Traitors US season 2, as the new players may decide to band together if they decide that Kate could be a traitor. Regardless of what happens to Kate on the series, her time on The Traitors US season 2 will be memorable.
