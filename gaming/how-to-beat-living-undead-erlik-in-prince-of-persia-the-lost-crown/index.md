## Literature Review

A massive boar called Erlik is a recurring boss in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown that you can try to defeat in both their living and undead forms.





[Warning: The following article contains minor spoilers for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.]




The first time you come across Erlik in Prince of Persia: TLC&#39;s modern Metroidvania world is at the very eastern edge of the Hyrcanian Forest. You have limited abilities against Erlik during your initial encounter, but this will not be the case the second time. Once knocked into The Depths after Vahram&#39;s betrayal, you have another opportunity to track down the now undead boar.

 How To Defeat Living Erlik 
          

Sargon must often dodge against Erlik&#39;s unblockable attacks and attack the boar from behind to stand a chance against this beast of nature. When Erlik glows red, the boss is about to unleash an attack that cannot be parried in any way. Sargon will take extra damage from these strikes if you try to parry and often die in a single hit due to Erlik&#39;s large damage output in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.




  Living Erlik Move List    Attack   Description   Can it Be Parried?    Poison Spit   Erlik glows red before spewing five poisonous orbs of sludge into the air toward Sargon at different angles. Each leaves a small pool of toxic slime on the ground where they land.   No    Forward Charge   Always after Poison Spit, Erlik takes a moment before charging forward at Sargon. When the boss gets close, they will swing their head up to try and hit Sargon in front of them. This attack has a wide arc that hits above Erlik&#39;s head.   No    Back Kick   If Sargon is behind Erlick, the boar will slide its back hoof across the ground before striking backward in a devastating kick with its back feet.   No    Tusk Slash   Erlik will slash their tusks in front of them if Sargon is standing right next to them. This attack is faster since there is no time to indicate an unblockable attack.   Yes   



Getting hit by the Poison Spit attack will cause Sargon to take damage over time, but this toxic degradation won&#39;t kill you unless you get hit by another attack. Remember to use your Potion(s) if you have low health during this boss fight if you&#39;re able. The best way to avoid Erlik&#39;s attacks is to slide underneath the boar whenever you see its eye glow red.



The Mage vendor at The Haven location in the Lower City can sell you upgrades to your Potions and give you better healing or more uses of the healing item. You must spend enough Time Crystals to purchase either of these upgrades.







The best strategy for this boss fight is to cling to the walls at the arena&#39;s edge and wait for Erlik to use their Forward Charge attack. You will always be able to jump over Erlik right before the boar swings its head up high enough to hit you out of the air. When you land on the ground next to Erlik, attack as much as possible to eventually take the boss down.

 Rewards For Beating Living Erlick 
          

Sargon moves forward through the main story quest to defeat the living form of Erlick, but the key reward from this boss fight is Menolias&#39; Bow. This new weapon changes the game and gives you new ways to explore Mount Qaf and attack enemies. This additional weapon fires a limited number of arrows at targets in any direction you choose throughout Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.






Once you unlock Kaheva&#39;s Forge, you may purchase upgrades for Menolias&#39; Bow in the same way you can improve Sargon&#39;s twin swords.




While on the ground, Sargon can hold the button to fire arrows to throw a Chakram as the Bow&#39;s alternate form. This Chakram returns to you after bouncing as a flexible projectile in many directions. Both of the Bow&#39;s forms are excellent for extending combos, and since the Chakram counts as a projectile, it may be parried back into enemies as it returns to Sargon.



 How To Beat Undead Erlick 

 

The inspiration from Ori and the Will of the Wisps can be seen in the second battle with Erlick, as Sargon has gained many new abilities and attacks. Time-traveling skills from at least one Simurgh Feather have been added to your arsenal against Erlick&#39;s undead form. One of the Feathers in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gives you a dash in the air that you can activate using the R2 button on your controller.






You can only unlock the path in The Depths leading to undead Erlick by accepting the &#34;Motherly Love&#34; side quest from the mysterious hooded woman found in a small room within the area.




Early impressions by YouTube creator FightinCowboy speak a bit about the Simurgh Feather abilities, but you cannot underestimate just how much of an advantage those skills give you for this boss. Undead Erlick has the same moves as his living form and can be a much easier fight. Extra Amulets and upgrades you&#39;ve purchased can make this fight almost trivial compared to the first.

Both forms of Erlick are also susceptible to Athra Surge attacks, or the super moves Sargon can unleash if they manage to charge their Athra meter enough in Prince of Persia: TLC. By reaching undead Erlick, you should have Level 1 and Level 2 Surges unlocked to improve your arsenal even further. Any Surge used on Erlick will take down much of its health, allowing you to end the fight quickly.






 Rewards For Defeating Undead Erlick 
          

Sargon receives plenty of Time Crystals for defeating the undead Erlick in Prince of Persia: TLC, but his main reward is the Indomitable Spirit Amulet. This item moderately increases the power of all your melee attacks when your health is low. Equipping this Amulet to Sargon&#39;s Necklace costs two slots, but there&#39;s no denying the versatility of having a buff to your damage in a desperate situation.

Those who defeat both living and undead forms of Erlick are able to make Sargon much stronger in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as they continue to face greater challenges within the Citadel.
