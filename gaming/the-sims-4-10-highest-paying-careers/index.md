## Literature Review

In order to make the most Simoleons and to live as lavishly as possible, players should take advantage of the best-paying careers in The Sims 4.




Just like in the real world, living in The Sims 4 is expensive, which makes the best-paying careers tempting ventures. Upon its release in 2014, the game came packaged with ten full-time careers, each with two distinct career branches. Since then, plenty of additional options have made their way into the game — whether it&#39;s through base game patches, content packs, or expansions, and many of the newer careers can be even more lucrative than what came with the base game.
While The Sims 4 has introduced more active careers since the launch of the game, it&#39;s still more than reasonable to wonder what will generate the most simoleons over time. The Get to Work expansion pack was the first to introduce active careers in The Sims 4, which let Simmers tag along during the work day. Since then, there&#39;s been a plethora of different expansions that have added jobs like Get Famous, Discovery University, Eco Lifestyle, and more. There&#39;s also the Freelancer career type, in which the Sim works completely from home, and with all these new careers, knowing which one nets the biggest profit is important.

The Sims 4 For Rent Expansion Pack adds malleable mechanics that give the game a slew of new creative potential, but other areas are hit or miss.












 








 10  City Master Planner (§12,600/Week) 
Career Track: Civil Designer


 







The City Master Planner career was introduced with the Eco Lifestyle pack and centers around urban design and planning. The Civic Planner career branch focuses on urban and civic development, while the Green Technician path focuses on green engineering, fabrication, and inventing. That said, the top-level career in that path, the Master Inventor, does not get paid nearly as much as a City Master Planner, which happens to be one of the highest-paying jobs in The Sims 4.

The Sims 4’s upcoming DLC For Rent will let players build apartments for groups of Sims to live in close confines, with all the drama that includes.








 9  Preeminent Partner (§12,600/Week) 
Career Track: Law
        

Those who have a penchant for studying the law may very well want to look into becoming a Preeminent Partner in The Sims 4, as it turns out to be one of the highest-paying careers in the game. Introduced via the Discovery University pack, getting a Distinguished degree from Britechester will set the Sim up for success in the long run. While going down the Judge branch will rake in huge daily earnings as Chief of Justice, going down the Private Attorney branch will actually net higher weekly earnings as a Preeminent Partner.
When calculating and comparing The Sims 4 career incomes, it&#39;s important to take note of how many hours the Sim is working per day, and how many days per week they are working as this will significantly impact the amount of money they make over the week. 






 8  Diamond Agent (§12,780/Week) 
Career Track: Secret Agent
        

If a Sim wants to become the next James Bond, the Diamond Agent branch of the Secret Agent career track is for them. Starting out as an Agency Clerk, those suited to the job will eventually become a Double Diamond Agent, where they can earn §12,780 per week. Sims need to be prepared to put the work in, though, as Double Diamond Agent has the longest working hours of any job in The Sims 4, with three 15-hour shifts per week. While no doubt exciting for the secret agent, players may want to make other characters to control in the meantime.

 7  Villain (§12,875/Week) 
Career Track: Secret Agent
        

Suggesting that crime can sometimes pay, the other career branch in the Secret Agent career track, Villain, earns slightly more than Diamond Agent. In the top position, Triple Agent, Sims can make §12,875 per week. While a better option overall for Secret Agents due to more money and fewer working hours, it&#39;s best suited for playful and mischievous Sims, as it requires a lot of Mischief skill-building. Plus, players with the Discover University expansion pack can even send Sims to study Villainy and get a boost in the Villain career track upon graduating — setting them up for success in one of the highest-paying careers.





 6  Investor (§12,992/Week) 
Career Track: Business
        

There is the Investor branch of the Business career track for Sims who want to use their money to make more simoleons. Sims can eventually become an Angel Investor, which will make them a tidy profit of §12,992 each week. While the Business career is a safe bet for those Sims with money-based aspirations, it is perhaps one of the least engaging careers in The Sims 4, as there is no work-from-home option or amusing edge found in other careers like Secret Agent or Astronaut. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a surefire way to earn lots of Simoleons in The Sims 4.





 5  Trend Setter (§13,530/Week) 
Career Track: Style Influencer


 







The Style Influencer career offers a choice between two equally creative positions — Trend Setter and Stylist — both of which are perfect for fashionable Sims. If players opt for the Style Influencer branch and make their way up to the Icon O&#39;Class title, they&#39;ll be making an impressive §13,530 per week. It&#39;s not quite as lucrative as the Stylist branch, but Sims needs to work just six hours a day in a five-day work week. Plus, the job comes with a digital sketch pad and a camera, which are fun to toy around with.

 4  Botanist (§14,700/Week) 
Career Track: Gardener
        

The Gardener career was delivered as part of the Seasons expansion pack, and while it might not sound as thrilling as other options at first, it&#39;s actually a great money-maker for green-fingered Sims. Players wanting to make as much money as possible should opt for the Botanist branch, as the highest-ranking job, PhD of Pollen, earns §420 per hour and thus §14,700 per week. Not only can characters get rich by working from home every day, but it can even be quite fun, especially for players who also own the Cottage Living expansion and can grow oversized crops in The Sims 4.





 3  Interstellar Smuggler (§14,868/Week) 
Career Track: Astronaut
        

While most Simmers are stuck on planet Earth (at least for now), having Sims successfully pursue the Astronaut career is a fun way for players to live out their space dreams. In particular, the Interstellar Smuggler path is one of the highest-paying careers in The Sims 4; the top job of this career branch will see Sims making a sizable §14,868 per week. However, players should be warned that Astronaut is one of the hardest careers to earn a promotion in, and just like in the real world, Sims need to be highly athletic to make it work.





 2  Stylist (§15,000/Week) 
Career Track: Style Influencer
        

For Sims who want to use their fashion sense for the betterment of the community, the Stylist branch of the Style Influencer career path is the perfect proposition. There isn&#39;t much of a difference between the Stylist and Trend Setter branches as far as gameplay is concerned, but Stylist proves to be more financially rewarding in the long run, because when Stylists become Personal Re-Imagers, they will earn §15,000 per week. Sims who reach this level also get a fun new feature — the ability to &#34;make trends&#34; — that can lessen the secondhand embarrassment from The Sims 4&#39;s notoriously unfashionable NPCs.





 1  Covert Operator &amp; Officer (§16,880/Week) 
Career Track: Military


 







The highest-paying career in The Sims 4 is the Military career track. Both the Covert Operator and Officer branches offer the same financial rewards, and those who successfully rise through the ranks will earn §16,880 per week in either of the jobs, be it Grand Marshal or Sim-in-Black. In order to take advantage of the best career in The Sims 4, players will need to own the StrangerVille game pack.
