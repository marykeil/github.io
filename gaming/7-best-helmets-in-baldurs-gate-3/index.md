## Literature Review

In addition to weapons and body armor, helmets play an important role in Baldur’s Gate 3. Here are the best ones you can find while exploring.





What is even better is that, even if the design of the equipped helmet is not to your liking, you are able to conceal it. By doing this, you ensure your character gets all of the bonuses provided by the piece of gear while maintaining the look you desire for them. With a higher rarity status, a piece of gear is likely to offer better benefits, so some of the best helmets in the game are also hard to find – some are Rare, while others are Very Rare, and one of them is considered a piece of Legendary armor in Baldur’s Gate 3.




























 








 7  Circlet Of Hunting 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

The Circlet of Hunting is one of the best helmets in Baldur’s Gate 3 because it is very punishing against enemies that face the wearer. When you have this equipped, your character will gain a &#43;1d4 bonus to Attack Rolls against creatures maked by Hunter’s Mark, True Strike, Faerie Fire, and Guiding Bolt.
Of course, there is a bit of a setup to make the Circlet of Hunting truly effective, but once the creature is marked, it will take extra damage from each Attack Roll. It may not be too much, but just enough to finish them off when your party is at its limit in a fight. The good part is that you can get this helmet in Act 2, by buying it from Araj Oblodra.





 6  Hood Of The Weave 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

While the bonuses provided by the Hood of the Weave in Baldur’s Gate 3 are rather simple, they are just enough to make the item one of the best helmets in the game. The equipping character essentially gets two bonuses. The first is a &#43;2 bonus to Spell Save DC, while the second is a &#43;2 bonus to spell Attack Rolls.
This can make your mages much more effective in battle, as they will increase their odds of landing spells on enemies, while also getting more protection via the Spell Save DC bonus. The unfortunate part is that Hood of the Weave can only be purchased later in the game, from the Mystic Carrion in Philgrave’s Mansion. In fact, this is also one of the hardest secrets in Act 3 of Baldur’s Gate 3.
Like most items from a vendor’s inventory, you cannot loot Mystic Carrion’s body for the Hood of the Weave. You need to purchase it. 






 5  Grymskull Helm 
Rarity: Very Rare


 







The Grymskull Helm is one of the very first exceptional helmets that you can unlock, as it presents itself in Act 1. This is one of the drops from the Adamantine Forge boss in Baldur’s Gate 3. The Grymskull Helm requires Heavy Armor Proficiency, making it perfect for tanks. When it is equipped, attacks cannot land Critical Hits on the wearer.
It also grants the user Resistance to Fire damage. The strongest feat about the Grymskull Helm, however, is the fact that it allows the user to cast Hunter’s Mark on opponents, making them take more damage when it is hit with a weapon attack. When paired up with a character with Circlet of Hunting, the opponent becomes an easy target.





 4  Bonespike Helmet 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

The Bonespike Helmet is a fantastic piece of gear in Baldur’s Gate 3, carefully crafted for Berserkers like Karlach. This helmet’s main ability is called Fury in the Marrow, and it dictates that when the user Rages, any hostile creature in a 3m radius needs to go through a Wisdom Saving Throw.
If they fail, they will take 2 - 8 Psychic damage and, if succeed the save, they receive half the damage. Equipping the Bonespike Helmet also grants the user a &#43;2 bonus to Intimidation and grants access to the Menacing Attack (Melee) Weapon action. This skill has a chance of frightening your target, making them more susceptible to damage.





 3  Sarevok’s Horned Helmet 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

Sarevok’s Horned Helmet is easily one of the strongest helmets in all of Baldur’s Gate 3, mainly due to the three bonuses it gives out. The first one is called Deathbringer’s Sight, and it grants Darkvision up to 3m – if you already have the ability, Darkvision’s radius is improved to 15m.
The second ability, Dauntless, prevents the user from being Frightened or afflicted with other emotion-altering conditions. Lastly, Sarevok’s Horned Helmet grants the user a &#43;1 bonus to Constitution Saving Throws. Obtaining it can be quite difficult, as it is related to a long questline in Act 3 and a boss fight against Sarevok himself.





 2  Helldusk Helmet 
Rarity: Very Rare


 







A part of the Helldusk armor set in Baldur’s Gate 3, the Helldusk Helmet does not provide the character with the ability to Fly like the body armor, but it does offer exceptional benefits. Its first perk, Infernal Sight, allows you to see in magical and regular darkness to up to 12m and prevents you from being Blinded. Additionally, Magical Durability grants the user a &#43;2 bonus to Saving Throws against spells.
The Helldusk Helmet also prevents Critical Hits from landing on the wearer and gives the user Immolating Gaze, a skill that can Frigthen targets, dealing an extra 2d8 Fire damage against Burning creatures. Such a fantastic set of skills locks it behind a secret door in the House of Hope in Act 3, but it is certainly worth the exploration.





 1  Helm Of Balduran 
Rarity: Legendary


 







The Helm of Balduran is arguably the best helmet in the game. It lives up to its Legendary reputation and stands as one of the most powerful broken items in Baldur’s Gate 3 as well. Its first perk, Balduran’s Vitality, heals the user for 2 hit points at the beginning of every turn.
Even if the healing is minimal, it may just be enough to keep the wearer standing. Balduran’s Favor, on the other hand, grants a &#43;1 bonus to Armor Class (AC) and Saving Throws. 

This Legendary helmet also grants immunity to Stun, and the user cannot be affected by Critical Hits. The Helm of Balduran is a piece of Medium Armor that grants great protective benefits for characters that go straight into the middle of the fray. It may be ill-suited for some mages, but it does stand tall as one of the strongest helmets – even if it is locked behind a puzzle and a complicated boss fight with Ansur in Baldur’s Gate 3.
