## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077 is incredibly detailed, even in some places that players aren’t able to get to through normal means like this one, new to Update 2.1.




Cyberpunk 2077 has some locations that developers created but for whatever reason did not make accessible to players by normal means, including one such area that has been found in new content from Update 2.1. Night City and its surrounding areas have many of these little spots that could have been designed as secrets for curious players to find or could have simply been blocked off due to not having enough time during development to finish them properly. The biggest surprise is just how detailed some of these places can be.




Update 2.1 of Cyberpunk 2077 was added on December 5, 2023, and brought many changes to the game, including a long-desired functioning metro system. If V doesn&#39;t feel like driving or fast traveling, they can use any of the NCART stations to pick a destination and sit back on a train car to enjoy the ride, which includes the views of Night City locations it passes. Some areas, understandably, had to be created for the metro to travel through while giving players a pleasant, tourist-like, experience of the city.

                  10 Best Hidden Secret Events In Cyberpunk 2077   Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC are full of secret side missions and lore that is hidden away for players to stumble across while playing.   


 One Of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Metro Stations Is Hiding Something 
A Detailed Secret Area From Update 2.1
          

One of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s new metro areas includes a tunnel going through the Petrochem Tower in Memorial Park and passing by an unusable metro station inside. As is the case in many other tunnels for the metro, decorations are visible, and NPCs are meandering about the spot. It is beautifully crafted for a quick peek as a train rolls past, and it hides many little details that would never be seen from the metro.






 Hidden Area Players Cannot Access By Normal Means 
Invisible Barriers Block The Way
         

SirMZK posted a video on YouTube (shown below) that shows his exploration of this Memorial Park metro station. Although V can follow the train tunnels nearly into the area, invisible barriers block the way just before entry. By cheating the system a little, players can float through the invisible walls and explore the inaccessible station, but if they try to walk around, they will quickly realize that the ground is not solid. Despite this small problem, the entire space is intricately detailed with decorations, trash, NPCs, and more to create a living section of Night City.


 




The NPCs tucked away in this forgotten space are even having conversations with dialogue that can be overheard. The tunnels leading into the station are seen to have NPCs working on scaffolding and posters on the walls, which could be viewed by someone on the metro. While impressive in their detail, they still make more sense than the areas of the hidden Memorial Park metro station and include many realistic features that cannot be seen by a train car.

                  One Hidden Location In Cyberpunk 2077 Turns It Into A Horror Game   Night City hides a terrifying secret in Cyberpunk 2077. Here’s what it is, where to find it, and how it ties into the wider lore of Phantom Liberty.   



 Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Hidden Metro Station Is Impressively Detailed 
Even Entering The Shop Gives A Full Experience
          

For regular players looking out the windows of the train in Cyberpunk 2077, there wouldn&#39;t need to be an actual inside area for the 25/7 Shop that is part of this Memorial Park Metro Station. Surprisingly, the store is intricately designed beyond what would be seen from the metro. Even walking around and peeking behind the counter, there are things on the floor, items stocking the shelves, and stacks of papers alongside a bored store employee. Likely this is simply due to copying code from another area of the game, but this is still an unnecessary detail when developers could have just made a blank storefront. It is fun to be able to explore, and it would be nice if, in the future, an update lets players walk around the area.




Large games will often include unfinished little segments that developers couldn&#39;t complete or had to cut, and so they had to delete or close them off from player access, with closing them off often being the easier choice. This hidden metro station in Memorial Park may have originally been planned to be an area that V could walk around in and explore by regular means, but instead became a decoration for the train instead. Alternatively, it could have been designed as something special to view from a passing train and the developer provided a little extra value. Either way, seeing spots such as these in Cyberpunk 2077 can add a lot to the immersion in the game, and gives an almost eery feeling of the NPCs actually being alive and doing their own things in areas that V cannot reach.
