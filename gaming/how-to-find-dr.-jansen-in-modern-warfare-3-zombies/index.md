## Literature Review

A special Extraction mission in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies asks you to find Dr. Jansen, a character whose position is hard to find on the Urzikstan map.





The orders to discover Dr. Jansen come after you have completed another mission called &#34;Where&#39;s Dr. Jansen?&#34; Finishing that quest allows you to drop into Urzikstan again and travel to an exfil, or a portal that transports you to a different map for the mission. However, the exact spot where you or your squad shows up may give you a chance to earn some XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies or gather some items to help prepare for the mission.




                  Modern Warfare 3: The Best Graphics (&amp; Performance) Settings For PC   To make sure your PC runs Modern Warfare 3 best, there are certain graphics and performance settings that shape the action into the best it can look.   


 Where to Find Dr. Jansen in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

You are able to find where Dr. Jansen is by locating the exfil icon that appears one minute after you drop into Urzikstan, which resembles a small figure running toward a star. This spot shows up to the northwest of Shahin Manor and almost directly east of the Zaravan Suburbs. If you want to go directly to Dr. Jansen&#39;s location, both these areas are excellent places to drop in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.

Despite the ease at which you can discover Dr. Jansen, it&#39;s recommended that you take the time to find supplies around the map first. You technically have 45 minutes in the match from your drop until you need to enter the exfil in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, giving you a ton of extra time to stock up. Keep in mind that there are no available weapons and items to buy once you enter the exfil, so you should only go through if you are ready.




                  When Modern Warfare 3 Unlocks (Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Launch Times)   Modern Warfare 3 is only a short way away, but its exact launch times vary by region and purchased edition. Hereâ€™s everything there is to know.   

Some Mystery Boxes around Urzikstan could give you random perks that may help against the zombies you&#39;ll undoubtedly face while trying to extract Dr. Jensen. Other weapons, gear, and power-ups like Perk-a-Cola machines are also incredibly useful to track down in the time you have to get ready. Try to find the Jugger-Nog flavor Perk-a-Cola if you can, since this type of beverage increases your maximum health in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.



One of the best things to get on the map before traveling through Dr. Jansen&#39;s exfil is a zombie dog, a companion who appears on the next map you travel to after you offer a Chunk of Flesh at the Doghouse.




Once you feel prepared, go ahead and travel through the exfil in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies to finally find Dr. Jensen and extract them from the undead infested map.
