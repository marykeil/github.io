Pawn Stars star Austin Lee Russell, typically known as Chumlee, has had various legal troubles over the years. Learn more about his alleged issues.

Pawn Stars cast member Austin Lee Russell, typically known as &#34;Chumlee&#34; on the series, has had various legal issues over the years, some of which have resulted in severe consequences. Over the show&#39;s 13-year run, Austin was a familiar face, as he ran the daily operations of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, Nevada. As a childhood friend of Corey &#34;Big Hoss&#34; Harrison, Austin had been working at the shop for a few years prior to the beginning of Pawn Stars, but the Nevada native&#39;s legal issues have seemingly taken over.



Pawn Stars, which has been on the air since 2009, shows the ins and outs of a 24-hour pawn shop in Las Vegas. Being located in a city that never sleeps, the store sees some incredibly interesting items come through as well as some intriguing situations. Though Austin has been on Pawn Stars since the beginning, his legal issues didn&#39;t come to the forefront until 2016, when they started overtaking his life. As a cast member of one of the most popular reality TV shows at the time, the interest in what he was being indicted for was high, and a look back at his legal issues may be helpful.

 Pawn Stars&#39; Austin Lee &#39;Chumlee&#39; Russell Was Arrested In 2016 

 

In March 2016, Austin was arrested after his apartment was searched in a sexual assault investigation, and the cops found various drugs and a gun in his home. Austin was booked for the drugs and the gun rather than on any sex-crime charges, because at the time the sexual assault investigation was ongoing. After making bail, Pawn Stars cast member Austin appeared in court and took a plea bargain that had him to plead guilty to a felony weapon charge and an attempted drug possession misdemeanor. By pleading guilty, he was able to stay out of jail, instead being sentenced to counseling and three years of probation.

Austin&#39;s plea bargain not only called for him plead guilty, complete counseling, and stay on probation for three years, but to surrender his weapons and drugs to law enforcement. According to PopCulture, when the cops seized his assets, they found both registered and unregistered weapons, some that Austin should not have personally owned. With assault-style MP5 weapons and .223-caliber rifles in his collection, Austin from Pawn Stars surrendered his weapons and was told to stay out of trouble until 2019. After years of keeping himself clean, Austin was left with only a misdemeanor on his record after the incident.

Pawn Stars may be one of the most highly rated reality TV shows to date, but it did not come without its own drama. Austin &#34;Chumlee&#34; Russell is still a figure on the show, along with Corey &#34;Big Hoss&#34; Harrison, whose grandfather and co-owner of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop passed away in 2018. With Pawn Stars continuing on in its newest iteration, it looks like Austin will appear on the show more often for years to come.
