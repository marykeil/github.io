## Literature Review

Selecting the perfect dream home in Starfield might take some consideration. Here are all the home locations available in the game, ranked.




In Starfield, while less useful than in other games like The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, homes serve more or less as a roleplaying mechanism that enables the crew to lay low and get some shut-eye. There are various homes, each with their associated costs, quality, and space to decorate, located in different cities across the Settled Systems. While later in the game, it&#39;s possible to amass great wealth in Starfield, where credits hardly even matter — during the early to mid-game, intelligent investment is key.
Though the ship and Outposts in Starfield can fulfill the role of a house or apartment and then some, homes aren&#39;t completely useless in the game. For one, they provide a safe place to store goods (better if it&#39;s contraband) or build crafting benches to upgrade gear. They also provide a bed to rest and recuperate after a long night out destroying Terrormorphs. In Starfield, obtaining all home locations in the game makes it possible to transform the character into a real estate mogul in their own right.
            
 
 &#34;An Instant Classic&#34;: Starfield Review 
Starfield has plenty of captivating tales and dynamic mechanics that make it an epic science fiction adventure - and an instant classic.












 








 10  Sleep Crate (Volii Alpha, Neon) 
Cost: 6,500 credits
        

The Sleep Crate vendor in Neon on Volii Alpha in the Volii system sells Sleep Crates — tiny little apartments, as the name would imply, that are about the size of a small shipping container. With a simple cot and enough space to walk a few steps, it&#39;s one of the worst homes in the game. Neon City is known more for debauchery and corruption than class and elegance, and the Sleep Crate perfectly embodies that.
The worst part is the window on the front door, completely obliterating any privacy. While it does serve as a decent location to lie low while completing Starfield&#39;s more unscrupulous missions, it pales in comparison with just about every other Starfield home.
            
 
 Starfield: How To Get a House In Neon 
The vibrant city of Neon in Starfield has a house that your character can own as one of their many homes throughout the galaxy. Here&#39;s how to get it.








 9  Parents Apartment (Jemison, New Atlantis) 
Cost: Free
        

While many wouldn&#39;t prefer to live with their parents, at least the Parents Apartment in New Atlantis is free — well, to some extent at least. This tiny bedroom can be obtained by selecting the Kids Stuff trait in the Starfield character creator. While the homestead is technically the character&#39;s parent&#39;s house, the bedroom is free to visit and use at any time. The Kids Stuff trait comes with a weekly fee to help the parents financially but amounts to almost nothing in the grand scheme of things, so it may be worth it for the room alone.

Starfield has a number of traits that give the player character affiliation with the game’s factions and religions, but they don’t provide much info.








 8  The Lodge Bedroom (Jemison, New Atlantis) 
Cost: Free
        

While The Lodge bedroom that&#39;s gained early in the game for completing Constellation quests is nothing too special, it is more spacious than other rooms in the game and provides a decent space to decompress after a long day of space exploration. Best of all, The Lodge apartment is completely free, no strings attached, and almost feels like a dorm room with the different explorers that all reside there. In addition, while the room itself is pretty basic, The Lodge basement is home to different workbenches, making it a convenient location to upgrade gear.





 7  The Bunks (Kryx System, The Key) 
Cost: Free


 







One often overlooked room, perhaps because it&#39;s really nothing impressive, there is a large communal living quarters at the bottom of The Key, full of free beds and lockers. These rooms, while small in square footage, make up for it with a premium location. As a central decision in all of the decisions that actually matter in Starfield, choosing the UC or Crimson Fleet for the &#34;Legacy&#39;s End&#34; mission actually has a lasting impact, with The Key being a more useful location to keep around due to its many vendors, especially those willing to buy contraband in Starfield.

Starfield’s conflict between the UC and Crimson Fleet factions eventually comes to a head, and you have to pick a side. But which one is better?








 6  Trade Tower Sky Suite (Volii Alpha, Neon) 
Cost: 235,000 Credits
        

Those looking to live in style in the hard city of Neon need to look no further than the Penthouse that&#39;s obtainable by speaking with the bartender at the Astral Lounge. Obtainable for 235,000 credits, the apartment is the most stylish home location in Neon, but that&#39;s not really saying much, and the hefty price tag accompanied by the purchase makes the studio apartment feel incredibly underwhelming. While the location does have balcony access, the view is anything but pleasant, with the dank streets of Neon and rusted industrial buildings filling the view below.





 5  Well Apartment (Jemison, The Well) 
Cost: 30,000 Credits
        

While The Well lurking under the pristine streets of New Atlantis wouldn&#39;t be many people&#39;s first choice for premium real estate, the Well Apartment is not too shabby. Though a bit rough around the edges, the Well Apartment is a two-story apartment with a balcony and only costs 30,000 credits from Alphelion Realty in New Atlantis. There&#39;s plenty of room to decorate the interior of the place, and it even comes accompanied by a balcony, though the views aren&#39;t anything to write home to.
The Well can be accessed by taking the elevator at the NAT Station to the bottom floor or by taking the elevator behind the Jemison Mercantile Store in the New Atlantis Spaceport.  






 4  Midtown House (Akila, Akila City) 
Cost: 45,000 Credits
        

The Midtown House in Akila City is one of two places where characters can live in the town. With a price tag of 45,000 credits, the Midtown Home in Akila City is a step up from some of the other one-bedroom residences available elsewhere. More spacious than other spaces across the Settled Systems, the Midtown Home is just one step down from an elite apartment and will be perfect for most people.
Akila and Akila City are located within the Cheyenne star system in Starfield.  






 3  Core Manor (Akila, Akila City) 
Cost: 75,000 Credits
        

For those seeking to live in style in the Freestar city of Akila, the Core Manor might be worth the hefty initial investment. The Core Manor is the nicer of the two home locations available in Akila City and provides a more spacious and quiet place for space explorers to lay their heads. With a pretty significant 78,000 credit cost, the exposed stone walls and hardwood floors make up for the price with a more refined aesthetic. Though the dusty locale of Akila City wouldn&#39;t necessarily scream refined, Core Manor proves that one shouldn&#39;t judge a book by its cover.
            
 
 All Companions In Starfield, Ranked Worst To Best 
Starfield has 27 different companions to choose from, and some are certainly better than others. Here&#39;s the full list, ranked.








 2  Mercury Tower Penthouse (Jemison, New Atlantis) 
Cost: Free


 







As the seeming center of the Settled Systems and home base for the United Colonies, the Penthouse in New Atlantis on the planet Jemison is arguably some of the best real estate in the game. Not only does New Atlantis offer all the amenities and services one would need to be a successful ship captain, but it&#39;s also one of the most beautiful areas in all of Starfield. Though it doesn&#39;t boast the spaciousness of the Dream Home, location matters, and no city does things bigger or better than New Atlantis.
Best yet, the Penthouse in New Atlantis doesn&#39;t cost a thing and is achievable by completing the main UC questline, with no strings attached. For all those reasons, it&#39;s undeniable that the Penthouse in New Atlantis is one of the best homes in Starfield.





 1  Dream Home (Olympus System, Nesoi) 
Cost: 125,000 Credits Or 500 Credits/Week


 







For those willing to doll out the 125,000 credits to pay off the GalBank mortgage, the Dream Home in Starfield is a great location and the most spacious house in the game. More like a mansion, the home&#39;s immense interior has multiple floors, rooms, and a walkable balcony with enough space to place furniture. More than just a place to lay low for a while, the Dream Home can really be interior decorated however one wants, with ample space for customization. 
Located on the colorful and beautiful planet of Nesoi, the Dream Home can also be rented for 500 credits per week when used, making it a great alternative for renters. The only catch is that it needs to be paid off, and the Dream Home trait must be selected in the character creation menu. The Dream Home can be found on planet Nesoi in the Olympus star system and is the most spacious and swanky home in Starfield.
