## Literature Review

Over 200 Pokémon compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all of them, listed in order.




The complete Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is fairly large and has over 200 creatures to register. The second expansion in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack continues and concludes the story initiated by The Teal Mask earlier in 2023. The new expansion takes place in Blueberry Academy, located in the Unova region. Although it is set in Unova, Blueberry Academy is an offshore institution.




The main focus there is competitive battling, so there are many challenges to face with the Double Battles proposed by the student Trainers found across the area. Despite this, there are many new and returning Pokémon, including Legendaries coming to Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. This ranges from creatures such as the new Paradox creatures Raging Bolt and Iron Crown to most of the starter Pokémon that were not originally available and even the Legendary bird trio from Kanto, for instance.

                  Pokémon Teal Mask DLC Full Pokédex: Every Kitakami Pokémon Number &amp; Type   The Kitakami Pokédex made available in Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC features 200 Pokémon. Here are all of them, their numbers, and their Types.

Over 200 Pokémon compose the Indigo Disk DLC Pokédex, formally called the Blueberry Pokédex. Granted, many of the creatures that compose the lineup are already available in the base game and in The Teal Mask’s Kitakami, but that is a fairly large number. The table below lists all the Pokémon in the Blueberry Pokédex, in order, according to Serebii’s database. The Pokémon’s types are also shown.

Creatures that have already been captured in Scarlet and Violet do not have to be caught again; they are already registered once the player obtains the Blueberry Pokédex at the start of the Indigo Disk DLC.






 Indigo Disk DLC Brings Many Returning Pokémon To Scarlet &amp; Violet 
         

There are a few new additions to the franchise with the arrival of the DLC, such as the Paradox forms of Entei and Terrakion or Dipplin’s evolution in Pokémon Indigo Disk, but most of the creatures that compose the Blueberry Pokédex are returning creatures from previous Generations. Some of the most notable additions are the starter creatures from every single Generation so far.

There are some creatures that are still unobtainable but have been discovered through datamining the expansion’s source code. One such example is Pecharunt, the Mythical peach Pokémon in Indigo Disk. This creature was previously leaked as Dokutaro. Even with the DLC being available, it seems like there is still more content planned for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
