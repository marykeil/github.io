## Literature Review

An exciting new Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces expansion is coming soon and will add a new dynamic, powerful cards, and more to the game.




The Pokémon Trading Card Game will be getting a game-changing new expansion in a couple of months, with the introduction of Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces, which will add powerful new cards to the experience. Following the typical schedule of new sets every few months, the next expansion will arrive after the Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates set, which releases at the end of January 2024. Whereas the Paldean Fates set features many of the shiny variants of cards, Temporal Forces appears to be focusing more on Paradox Pokémon and some extra powerful cards.




Temporal Forces will be the sixth expansion announced for the Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet set, presuming that the Scarlet &amp; Violet -151 expansion is included in the count. The new set is expected to be composed of cards from the Japanese sets Wild Force and Cyber Judge, which will both debut on January 26, the same day the non-Japanese version of the game will release Paldean Fates. This will allow for a pretty good indication of what to expect in Temporal Forces.

                  What Pokémon TCG Expansion Is After Paldean Fates In 2024   Pokémon TCG’s next expansion, Paldean Fates, releases at the end of January, and Trainers won’t have to wait long for another set to follow.   


 Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces Release Date Info 
Likely To Arrive In March
          

As of the time of writing, there has been no official announcement from the Pokémon Trading Card Game regarding anything to do with Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces. The information gained so far has come from PokéBeach, who was given exclusive access to reveal the name Scarlet &amp; Violet: Temporal Forces and stated that Temporal Forces will be released on March 22, 2024. The logo for the set has not been revealed yet, but pre-releases are expected to happen between March 9 and 17.






 What To Expect From Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces 
Cards From The Japanese Cyber Judge And Wild Force Sets
         

Before any Secret Rares are counted in, it is expected that the Scarlet &amp; Violet: Temporal Forces set will include approximately 200 cards. Justinbasil has put together a list of which cards are most likely to appear in the expansion. These are cards currently shown to be included in various Japanese sets for the Pokémon TCG and are the most probable to be carried over into this one.

 Pokémon  Where It Currently Appears In Japanese Sets   Iron Leaves ex  Cyber Judge   Gouging Fire ex  Wild Force   Walking Wake ex  Wild Force   Iron Hands  Starter Deck Miraidon   Iron Thorns  Cyber Judge   Tinkaton  Gym Promo   Scream Tail  Starter Deck Koraidon   Flutter Mane  Wild Force   Iron Valiant  Starter Deck Miraidon   Iron Crown ex  Cyber Judge   Garganacl ex  Gym Promo   Great Tusk  Starter Deck Koraidon   Sandy Shocks  Starter Deck Koraidon   Iron Boulder ex  Cyber Judge   Koraidon ex  Starter Deck Koraidon   Miraidon ex  Starter Deck Miraidon   Raging Bolt ex  Wild Force   Iron Jugulis  Starter Deck Miraidon   Cryptomaniac&#39;s Deciphering  Cyber Judge   Explorer&#39;s Guidance  Wild Force   Master Ball  Starter Deck Miraidon   Prime Catcher  Cyber Judge   Raifort  Gym Promo   Neo Upper Energy  Wild Force   








None of these cards have been officially announced as being part of the Pokédex for Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces.




A few of the above-mentioned cards, particularly the Master Ball, Neo Upper Energy, and Prime Catcher, are special cards for the Pokémon TCG as they will be bringing back the ACE SPEC cards, which provide incredibly powerful abilities. Because of how strong an ACE SPEC card is, only one of this type is allowed per deck.

                  10 Shiny Pokémon Cards From Paldean Fates You&#39;ll Want ASAP   The Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: Paldean Fates set will include 240 cards with more than 100 of them being shiny and all new Pokémon ex varieties.   



 ACE SPEC Cards Return With Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces 
Originally Released For Black And White
          




ACE SPEC cards have not been seen in the Pokémon TCG since the Black &amp; White series and were announced at the Kyoto Championships League 2024 tournament to be returning with the Japanese expansions Wild Force and Cyber Judge as well as the Japanese Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets. For Scarlet &amp; Violet, the unique cards feature magenta coloration to truly stand out from the rest of the deck. Only three ACE SPEC cards have been revealed currently.

 Card Name  Card Description (per Japanese cards)   Master Ball  Search your deck for a Pokémon, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then, shuffle your deck.   Prime Catcher  Switch in one of your opponent&#39;s Benched Pokémon to the Active Spot. If you do, switch your Active Pokémon with one of your Benched Pokémon.   Neo Upper Energy  As long as this card is attached to a Pokémon, it provides [C] Energy If this card is attached to a Stage 2 Pokémon, this card provides every type of Energy but provides only two Energy at a time instead.   



The ACE SPEC cards previously were only item cards, so having an Energy card be ACE SPEC in the case of Neo Upper Energy card will present a new dynamic and is incredibly handy as gaining Energy is typically an ongoing issue for many.




                  10 Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates ex Cards You&#39;ll Want To Collect ASAP   The Paldean Fates expansion for Pokémon TCG is full of noteworthy cards. Here are some of the best and most beautiful ones in the entire set.   



 New Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets 
Miraidon Ex And Koraidon Ex
          

Along with the Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces set, there is a good chance that there will be two new Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets added to the game as well, which provide a great intro point for new players by including everything that is needed to play a game. In Japan, these new Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets are confirmed and will feature Koraidon ex and Miraidon ex with decks built around these cards. While not officially announced for the English version yet, these will most likely be appearing in English at the same time as Temporal Forces.




Beyond the official name Temporal Forces, nothing has been officially announced yet for what cards are going to be included or if the new Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets will also be coming to the English version. Following traditional patterns, however, it is very likely that the set will have a lot of similarities with what the Japanese versions are getting in Wild Force and Cyber Judge, including the ACE SPEC cards. However, until an official announcement has been made regarding the Pokémon Trading Card Game, everything is still just speculation at this point.
