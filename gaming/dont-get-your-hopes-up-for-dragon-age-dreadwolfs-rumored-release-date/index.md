## Literature Review

Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been in development hell for close to a decade; however, a recent LinkedIn update has got fans incredibly excited.




Although a Senior Cinematic Animator at EA, Kevin Scott, added Dragon Age: Dreadwolf to his LinkedIn page with the inclusion of “(2024 release),&#34; the game does not yet have an official release date. Scott&#39;s update to his LinkedIn page (via GamesRadar) has stoked the fires of fan excitement; however, the current state of the game&#39;s developer, BioWare, may indicate that fans of the franchise should not get their hopes up for a 2024 release of this long-awaited sequel.




While Scott has changed his post from &#34;(2024 release)&#34; to &#34;(Release TBD),&#34; speculation abounds regarding whether his original LinkedIn update was an unintentional confirmation of things to come, or simply a mistake. Irrespective of Scott&#39;s update, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been cursed with delay after delay; with the game&#39;s developer laying off over 50 developers in mid-2023, many fans of the Dragon Age franchise have become listless and worried that Dreadwolf may be in trouble.

                  Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - Everything We Know So Far   Details for the latest Dragon Age game, Dreadwolf, have been scarce. Here&#39;s everything fans need to know about Bioware&#39;s newest offering.   


 What Do We Know So Far About Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&#39;s Development 
Delays, Staff Turnover, And Leaks
          

The development of the fourth main entry in the Dragon Age series, Dreadwolf, began back in 2015, and as this lengthy development cycle may suggest, it has been far from smooth sailing. Plagued with lengthy delays, a cancelation, and high staff turnover, it is somewhat of a miracle that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf remains in development at all. Quite possibly, the most impactful factor contributing to the ongoing delay is the game&#39;s almost revolving door of key development staff. Following the initial cancelation, a number of senior Dragon Age staff members, including its creative director, Mike Laidlaw, left BioWare. Though he was replaced, his successor also eventually quit the project.




Although it seemed as though Dreadwolf was making good progress by the early 2020s, in August 2023, BioWare laid off a total of 50 staff members working on Dreadwolf and a future Mass Effect title - terminations that have led to litigation regarding severance pay and excessively stringent NDAs. Though this staffing palaver has set the game&#39;s release back years, a series of gameplay leaks, as well as EA&#39;s financial reports, seem to indicate that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is close to complete and projected to release in the second half of 2024. That being said, fans should avoid excessive optimism, as judging by its rocky development, more delays are not unfathomable.



 A Senior Staffer&#39;s LinkedIn Slip-Up May Confirm A 2024 Release 
Fans Are Excited, But Should They Be?
         

In the experience section on his LinkedIn page, Kevin (Boog) Scott, lists himself as a full-time Senior Cinematic Animator at Electronic Arts (EA); in the description box below this entry, he notes the roles he has played and games he has worked on - including Dragon Age: DreadWolf. Though the description has changed, now stating &#34;(Release TBD),&#34; eagled-eye fans of the Dragon Age franchise were quick to point out that it originally noted &#34;(Release 2024).&#34; Though this is not an official release date confirmation from BioWare or EA, Scott is a credible and senior figure in the game&#39;s production team, and his possible slip-up has many Dragon Age fans incredibly excited.




Despite Kevin Scott altering his LinkedIn update from &#34;(2024 release)&#34; to &#34;(Release TBD),&#34; he is not the only senior staffer working on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf to indicate that 2024 may see the release of the long-awaited game. In late September 2023, in a YouTube Q and A, Mark Darrah, a BioWare Game Consultant, commented that Dreadwolf is moving towards the end of its production and will soon be getting ready to ship. Additionally, journalist and industry insider Jeff Grubb recently replied to a Tweet inquiring as to the status of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf’s development, commenting that it is &#34;doing well.&#34;


 



 Could The Speculation Be Right? 
Official EA Financial Reports Shed Potential Light On Release Date
          




Released May 9, 2023, EA published their financial reports in a document titled Electronic Arts Inc. Q4 and FY23 Results. While the vast majority of this document is of little interest to fans of EA&#39;s games, it may have indirectly confirmed that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be released in mid-to-late 2024. Though not overt, the reference to &#34;two unannounced games&#34; that are set for release in the 2024 fiscal year may shed some light on the release date of the latest Dragon Age game. By stipulating that these two games are - an &#34;EA Sports title and Racing title,&#34; EA has shown that at the earliest, Dreadwolf will come in FY25.

Though this may be disheartening to those most excited about Dreadwolf, as late 2023 and early 2024 won&#39;t see a release, the possibility of a mid-to-late 2024 launch date, when taking into account Scott&#39;s post and Darrah&#39;s comments, seems ever more likely; however, without an official announcement from BioWare or EA, even the most promising of comments could result in enormous disappointment. Fans of the Dragon Age franchise have not experienced a new title since 2014&#39;s outstanding Dragon Age: Inquisition, and while they have that and other games in the series to keep them busy, they should not get their hopes up for an immediate release of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
