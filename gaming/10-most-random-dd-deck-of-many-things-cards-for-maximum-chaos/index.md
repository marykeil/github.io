## Literature Review

The Deck of Many Things can help players by enhancing their characters, but the cards can also cause untold chaos if they&#39;re drawn at the wrong time.




The Deck of Many Things has been a staple of Dungeons &amp; Dragons for almost 40 years. When a character draws a card, a magical effect occurs. Some are peaceful and beneficial, and some are powerful enough to disrupt the session, if not the entire campaign.
The Book of Many Things for DnD 5e introduced dozens of additional cards to the game for the first time in decades. Most of them are boons to the party, but more than a few of them can cause tumult like many of the original cards. DMs can choose which cards to include in the Decks their players draw from, and if they&#39;re more chaotically aligned, the more likely a game-changing card will be shuffled in.
            
 
 D&amp;D: 10 Best New Cards From The Deck Of Many Things 5e 
The new cards added to the 5e version of The Deck of Many Things are incredibly powerful and fun to play with, and most are beneficial.












 








 10  Key 
Teleport 30 Feet Immediately As A Bonus Action
        

The Key card in The Deck of Many Things will give the player the ability to teleport. The card reads, &#34;As a bonus action, teleport, with anything you are wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to a space you can see.&#34; Depending on the DM&#39;s interpretation of the rules, the Key card can give a player a single teleport immediately, which can cause chaos in many situations by having a character suddenly disappear and reappear elsewhere. The DM could also interpret this as a learned ability, like the spell misty step that the player can use at will since the card gives no indication of usage limits. A rogue or barbarian with unlimited teleports could cause unimaginable chaos in the right hands.





 9  Skull 
Summon The Avatar Of Death
        

The namesake of the skull helm magical item from The Book of Many Things, the Skull card summons the avatar of death within 10 feet of the character, and it immediately begins to attack. It fights to the death, either the player&#39;s or its own. If any other party members join in, a new avatar of death appears to kill them, too. The creatures must be fought alone; if anyone dies by the summoned avatar, they can&#39;t be restored to life by any means.





 8  Beast 
Morph Into A CR5 Or Lower Beast


 







Turning into an animal without warning would surprise just about anybody. Drawing the Beast card from The Deck of Many Things transforms the character into a beast with a challenge rating of five or under and replaces all of their ability scores, hit points, and actions with that of the new form. Magical items can no longer be used, either. The card&#39;s text makes no mention of it being temporary nor a way to transform back, so the beast is that player&#39;s new character. The card indicates the beast is chosen at random, too, which makes it just as likely the player turns into an owlbear or triceratops as they are a tiny bird or insect.
            
 
 10 Weirdest D&amp;D Monsters That Can Derail Just About Any Campaign 
D&amp;D is packed full of wild and weird monsters for DMs to choose from. Here are some of the strangest players can encounter on their adventures.








 7  Fey 
Get Pulled Through A Portal To The Feywild
        

Fey in Dungeons &amp; Dragons aren&#39;t always the friendliest, and the Feywild, their home plane, is not always the most welcoming realm to mortals. When the Fey card is drawn, a portal opens to the Feywild and pulls the character through it in a flash of rainbow light, and nothing but chaos can come. Luckily for the party, the portal stays open for 1 minute, so they can follow through and help their companion if they choose. They won&#39;t know that, however, and if they hesitate, the character who drew the card might be stranded and alone in a beautiful but deadly new realm.





 6  Ooze 
A Gelatinous Cube Appears Out Of Nowhere
        

A fan-favorite monster, the gelatinous cube is one of the most well-known creatures in DnD. When the Ooze card gets drawn, a gelatinous cube appears in the character&#39;s space and engulfs them. They start taking acid damage immediately, even more on each of the cube&#39;s turn, are unable to breathe, and has to succeed at a strength check to escape or continue to be slowly digested.
            
 
 How The Gelatinous Cube Works In D&amp;D: Honor Among Thieves (&amp; Why It Burns) 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves features many different D&amp;D creatures, including a strange, giant gelatinous cube, but how does the cube work?



The real chaos of this card comes not from the sudden appearance of the gelatinous cube but from the fact that the card states &#34;a gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you,&#34; which indicates there is no saving throw required as when the cube uses the attack during a combat encounter.





 5  Corpse 
Drop To 0 Hit Points And Make Death Saves
        

Upon drawing the Corpse card, a character loses all hit points and begins making death saving throws. For every turn, which is 6 seconds long, the character has to roll 10 or higher on a saving throw against death. On three failures, the character dies. Usually, this happens in combat, giving plenty of time for other characters to react and heal them. With the Corpse card, however, &#34;spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized.&#34; This means that the character has a roughly 41% chance of dying and being unable to be resurrected outside of a wish spell.





 4  Ruin 
Lost All Forms Of Wealth


 







The Ruin card is a truly chaotic card to draw. &#34;All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you.&#34; Gold disappears. Property and businesses and anything of that nature are also gone. Reality bends to make sure that the character who draws the Ruin card is just that â€” ruined. Luckily, the character will not lose magic items, meaning they can still adventure and work back toward what they once had. If, however, they were wearing non-magical, but very nice clothing, the DM could even make a case for that to vanish, too.





 3  Donjon 
Get Stuck In An Extradimensional Dungeon Cell
        

The Donjon card basically banishes a character and puts them in suspended animation inside an extradimensional dungeon sphere. The character is unable to escape on their own, and their party does not know where they have disappeared to. No divination magic can locate the imprisoned character, but a wish spell can provide the location of the prison. Chaos will undoubtedly ensue as the party tries to find their lost friend, and the player tries to figure out how to move forward while their character is locked away.





 2  Moon 
Cast Wish 1d3 Times
        

Wish is the ultimate spell in Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Depending on the edition, wish can do almost anything. From bringing a character or NPC back to life, making someone king or a god, or even just making them rich beyond measure, the ninth-level spell is only attainable by the most powerful magic users in the game. Unless they draw the Moon card. Even a level 1 non-spellcaster will be able to cast the most powerful spell in the game up to 3 times. In 5e, the wish spell has more limitations than in previous editions, but it can still make almost anything happen. When that power is in the players&#39; hands and not the DMs, chaos is sure to follow.





 1  The Fates 
Rewrite Reality By Erasing One Event


 







The only thing more powerful than having a handful of wishes in DnD is having the ability to rewrite the fabric of reality. The Fates card from The Deck of Many Things allows players to &#34;avoid or erase one event as if it never happened.&#34; As if that weren&#39;t powerful enough, the character doesn&#39;t have to rip apart reality immediately. They can save this amazing gift to use anytime before they die. Unfortunately, they can&#39;t use it to prevent their own death, but they can see it coming and make it so that the events that led up to it didn&#39;t occur.
Players in Dungeons &amp; Dragons are notorious for derailing the dungeon master&#39;s well-planned narratives. With The Fates card, not only can they use the normal game mechanics to throw a little chaos into the DM&#39;s plans, but they can also simply retcon whatever they want and force a redo. Some DMs will be more amenable to this than others, but there&#39;s no doubt that maximum chaos can come when a player gains the in-game ability to tell the DM no.
