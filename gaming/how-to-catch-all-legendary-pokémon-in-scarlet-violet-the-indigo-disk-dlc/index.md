## Literature Review

There are 25 wild Legendary Pokémon available for catching in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but each one must be unlocked with an item.





However, this is no easy feat, as these exclusive Pokémon are only available after defeating the BB League Elite Four and Kieran, the final boss of the Indigo Disk DLC. Not only that, but many of the legendaries are quite tricky to catch even once located, so players truly have their work cut out for them if they hope to catch &#39;em all.




                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC Final Boss &amp; Ending Explained (In Detail)   Both the final boss encounter and ending of the Indigo Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are shocking. Here&#39;s everything that happens in detail.   


 How To Unlock Legendary Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC 
         

As stated, the 25 Legendary Pokémon available for catching in the Indigo Disk DLC will not be available right away. Once the Elite Four and Kieran have been defeated, players will be invited down to Area Zero for the second portion of the DLC, where they will be able to catch the final Scarlet &amp; Violet Legendary Pokémon, Terapagos. Following this, the credits will roll, notifying players that the DLC has been completed.

Once the credits finish, players will be instructed to speak with a man at the entrance. The man, Snacksworth, will provide information on where each of the 25 available Legendary Pokémon can be found and give a snack to lure them out in exchange for the completion of Solo BBQs and Group BBQs. Snacksworth will only provide one Legendary treat and location at a time, so be sure to speak with him until he finishes providing all 25. Note that all the locations will be in the base game map of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.






Snacksworth will instruct you on how many more BBQs need to be completed before he will provide the next Snack once players reach their cap. Note that a Legendary will not spawn without the associated Snack from Snacksworth. Additionally, the Snack will remain in inventory until that Legendary is caught. This means even if the Legendary faints, it will reappear after a few hours, in case players forgot to save beforehand. Finally, Snacksworth will repeat any location riddle needed by speaking with him again.






 Where To Find &amp; Catch All 25 Legendary Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC 
 Pokemon  Location  Image   Articuno  West of Montenerva, in the snowy mountains, there will be a small pond with an iceberg platform in the center. Head to the pond to find Articuno hanging out along the northern side of it in a Blizzard.                         Zaptos  Head to the Lighthouse found at the very beginning of the base game, which has its own fly point titled Poco Path Lighthouse. Climb to the top of the Lighthouse to find Zaptos waiting.                         Moltres  Head to the Asado Desert. Once there, head to the northern end, where the desert turns to grass. There will be a platform to the right. Climb to the top of it to find Moltres waiting amidst a sandstorm.                         Lugia  Fly to the northeast corner of the map of Paldea. There will be a very small beach with a few tiny islands off the coast. Lugia can be found swimming around them.                         Ho-Oh  Head to the set of cascading waterfalls near Alfornada, specifically to the east of the city. Ho-Oh can be seen on a platform containing one tree that is directly west of the lowest of the three waterfalls.                         Entei  Head to the eastern coast of Paldea, specifically east of the East Province (Area Three). Use the fly point labeled Levinicia Lighthouse and then head directly north from there. Entei will be on a platform overlooking the water.                         



 Pokémon  Location  Image   Raikou  South of the Asado Desert on the west side of Paldea, Raikou can be found standing in front of a boulder near the peak of the mountain where the Icerend Shrine is. Do not go all the way to the top, he is at the highest point still covered in grass.                         Suicune  Suicune can be found in the northwest of Paldea on an island in Casseroya Lake. From the largest island in the center, head directly west to a smaller island where Suicune will be waiting.                         Groudon  Go through the cave entrance north of Alfornada that leads underneath the city. Continue through the cave, heading south until reaching a small raised platform on the southeastern end of the cave where Groudon can be found.                         Kyogre  If you have the fast travel point, Gracia Stones, then simply travel there and jump into the water to find Kyogre. If not, this area can be found north of Casseroya Lake, along the northern coastline, where some large stones will be protruding from the water.                         Rayquaza  Rayquaza is perhaps one of the highest Pokémon to track down, as it rests on the rim of the Great Crater of Paldea. Head to the Southeastern edge of the crater to find Rayquaza waiting.                         






 Pokémon  Location  Image   Latios  There is a small lake southwest of the Firescourge Shrine with a tree in the center of it. Latios can be found along the southeastern corner of the land.                         Latias  Fly to the South Province Watch Tower and go directly south to the little patch of sand on the coast to find Latias along the shore. It is the westernmost sandy shore along the southern coast of Paldea.                         Zekrom  South of Artazon, there will be a large, flat mountain platform. Zekrom can be found on the southeastern edge of this platform overlooking the water with his back to a wall.                         Reshiram  East of the Great Crater of Paldea, Reshiram can be found on a cliff edge next to the top of a small waterfall south of Zapapico City, overlooking it.                         



 Pokémon  Location  Image   Kyurem  Head to the Dalizapa Passage fly point and take the tunnel that heads West. Halfway down the tunnel, there is a hole near the ceiling on the right side. Jump in and follow that path down to find Kyurem.                         Virizion  In the Tagtree Thicket, head to the northeastern part of the forest, where Virizion will be tucked away along the wall among some trees.                         Terrakion  Directly north of Cortondo City, there will be a grass platform sticking off the western edge of the Great Crater of Paldea. The platform is slightly northwest of the Pokemon League. Terrakion can be found right in the center of this platform.                         Cobalion  Directly west of the Firescourge Shrine, there is a path leading up to a cliff edge where Cobalion can be found. For the easiest method of locating Cobalion, fly to Fury Falls and then head up the cliff to the southwest of the waterfall. Cobalion will be on the edge right there at the top.                         Solgaleo  Head to the roof of the Pokémon League to find Solgaleo sitting right in the center.                         



 Pokémon  Location  Image   Lunala  Along the western coast, north of Porto Marinada, there is a small beach. Head over to where the waterfall separates most of the beach from a smaller sliver (where the river meets the sea). Fly to the top of this waterfall and look on the northern side of it to find Lunala along the cliff&#39;s edge.                         Necrozma  North of Casseroya Lake, there will be a large area in the center of the small forest where the Groundblight Shrine can be found. Necrozma is on a ledge that is slightly southeast of the shrine.                         Kubfu  If the fast travel point, Fury Falls, is unlocked, then simply travel to it and find Kubfu waiting right where you will spawn. Fury Falls is located directly north of the Firescourge Shrine where a waterfall descends, among a forest of Bamboo. Kubfu can be evolved into Urshifu after being caught.                         Glastrier  Fly to the Glaseado Gym fly point and head directly south down the mountain to find some Ruins that can also be seen on the map. Glastrier will not be in the Ruins as the riddle insists, rather he will be on a snowy hill slightly north of them, overlooking them.                         Spectrier  Directly north of the Great Crater of Paldea in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, players will find one of the small stone ruins west of the Dalizapa Passage point. Spectrier is standing in front of these ruins.
