## Literature Review

The Undead Prisoner is a boss you have to beat in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as you try to make your way toward the forests beyond the Citadel.





Make sure to spend Time Crystals at The Mage&#39;s shop in The Haven area to upgrade the amount of Potions Sargon has in Prince of Persia: TLC. While you may not have access to time travel mechanics in the game yet, you do have the opportunity to improve your ability to heal. The Mage vendor can also sell you an upgrade that enhances how much life your Potion heals if you have enough Crystals.






You should only buy the Potion healing improvement upgrade if the Blessing Amulet is equipped with Sargon&#39;s Necklace since that item gives you an additional bar of life to use that enhanced recovery.

You have to land Vengeful Counters and dodge every unblockable attack of the Undead Prisoner to have a chance at beating this boss. The Undead Prisoner wields a massive stone pillar like a club and swings it around to deal massive amounts of damage. The boss can leap across the arena, making it hard to pin down as you try to attack in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.




Like General Uvishka, Sargon cannot launch the Undead Prisoner into the air for a combo like he can on basic enemies. Instead, you will have to use your basic attack combos to deal damage throughout the fight. Nearly all the Prisoner&#39;s attacks glow red, meaning you cannot parry them without taking extra damage.

You will want to press Forward &#43; R2 to slide under the Prisoner&#39;s legs to dodge their attacks, which almost always hit directly in front of the boss. Wait until you see the Prisoner glow yellow during an attack to land a Vengeful Counter by parrying at the right moment. Pulling off this successfully will play a short movie where Sargon deals a ton of damage to the boss and staggers them for a short time.
