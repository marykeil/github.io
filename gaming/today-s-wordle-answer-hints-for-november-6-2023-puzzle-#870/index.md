The November 6th Wordle is TRADE.




Not too difficult of a word today and even with our weak start we were able to solve today&#39;s answer quite quickly. For our starting Wordle word we used POUND, this only provided a single misplaced &#39;D&#39; and a few incorrect letters.

Moving forward we tried DRAGS as our second attempt. this covered most of the other vowels and proved successful providing two correctly placed letters and giving away the only possible place for the &#39;D&#39;. The last clues quickly led us to victory with our Wordle win-in-three with TRADE.
