## Literature Review

Claim a free Shiny Lucario and Master Ball in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to celebrate the launch of The Indigo Disk. Here are the Mystery Gift codes.





Located in the region of Unova, Blueberry Academy is a sister school to Naranja and Uva Academies in Paldea. There, you will double down on an intense battling program, as the school specializes in Double Battles. It is expected that there will be a new type in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, as well as the reveal of new Shinies that were previously Shiny locked. Considering both the official promotional material and the leaked bits of information about the expansion, it seems like The Indigo Disk will have a lot to offer – and that starts with a free copy of a Shiny Lucario and a Master Ball for everyone.




                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Leaks Hint At A Groundbreaking New Type Combination   According to new leaks about the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, a unique and unused type combination will finally make its debut.   


 How To Get Shiny Lucario In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet (Shiny Lucario Mystery Gift Code) 
          

The Shiny Lucario is being given out via a limited-time distribution event through the Mystery Gift feature in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To claim this special reward, you will have to enter the game and, within it, access the menu with the X button. From there, you will have to connect the game to the internet using the L button on your Nintendo Switch.

After it is done, you need to access the Poké Portal and, within it, navigate down to Mystery Gift. There, you will have to choose the option “Get with Code/Password” to redeem your copy of Shiny Lucario.






Shiny Lucario can be redeemed even if you have not purchased The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack. This distribution event is available for everyone who has Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.




According to the official Pokémon website, the Shiny Lucario code for Mystery Gift is “SH1NYBUDDY”. After you type that in and the game correctly indicates that you intend to grab the Shiny Lucario Gift, you can claim it. If there is a space in your party, Lucario will be incorporated into it. If not, the creature will be sent to your first available slot in the Boxes. The free Shiny Lucario in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will be at level 75 and have a Steel Tera Type. As a distribution event Pokémon, Lucario has the Classic Ribbon, which can be equipped in the Memories Page in its Summary.

The distribution event that gives out a free copy of Shiny Lucario is time-sensitive: the gift can only be claimed until January 3, 2024, at 3:59 p.m. PST. After that, it will be impossible to get the free Shiny Lucario through this method. You can still try to find the creature in its alternative yellow form via Shiny Hunting in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but it will not come in a special Cherish Ball or have a Classic Ribbon. The event-specific Shiny Lucario can only be claimed once per game account, which makes it impossible to obtain multiple copies of this same creature on the same profile.






The event Shiny Lucario distributed via Mystery Gift knows the following moves: Flash Cannon, Aura Sphere, Bullet Punch, and Ice Punch. Its Ability is Inner Focus, and its stats are considered “Amazing.”






 How To Get Free Master Ball Via Mystery Gift In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet 
         

Although they were presented together in the most recent Indigo Disk DLC trailer posted on the official Pokémon channel on YouTube, the distribution events for Shiny Lucario and the Master Ball are unrelated. To claim the free Master Ball in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you will also need to boot up your Mystery Gift feature. Instead of heading over to the code section, however, you will need to select the “Get via Internet” option. While connected to the internet, the game will automatically process your request and offer you the Master Ball gift, which can be claimed. The item will be sent to your Bag.






After claiming anything from the Mystery Gift function, it is recommended that you save your game to ensure your rewards stay with you.




Like the free Shiny Lucario gifted through Mystery Gift, the Master Ball prize is also time-limited. According to the official website, you can claim this rare item for free via the Mystery Gift function from December 14 through January 3, 2024, at 3:59 p.m. PST. For reference, the Master Ball becomes available on the day the that Indigo Disk DLC is released for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Nintendo Switch. Similarly to the Shiny Lucario gift, only one copy of the Master Ball gift can be claimed per game account via this particular Mystery Gift distribution event.

Master Balls are quite rare in the game, and it is common for only one to be given out through the course of the campaign. This special ball has a 100% capture rate, making any Pokémon it touches a guaranteed catch. It is often saved to be used on rare Pokémon, such as Shinies, Legendaries, and Mythicals. It will come in handy, particularly with the set of Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC, which includes 25 returning creatures. Out of these monsters from previous generations, three of them will allegedly make their Shiny debuts in the expansion, as their previous Shiny locks have been lifted, according to some leaks.






If one of them is capable of evolving in the DLC, then there will be a total of four Shiny locks removed from Legendaries in The Indigo Disk.




These are not the only events that will celebrate the release of the Indigo Disk DLC. For an even more limited time, Nintendo is also giving out a free copy of Darkrai in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and hosting special Tera Raid events featuring Palkia and Dialga throughout December.
