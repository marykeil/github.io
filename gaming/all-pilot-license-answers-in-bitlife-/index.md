## Literature Review

Flight School can pose difficult questions in BitLife, but finding out all the answers may be easier than you think as you earn your Pilot License.





Before taking the final exam from Flight School, you must take 40 hours of flying lessons once you enter the piloting school with a STEM degree in BitLife from a university. Go to your main menu and select Activities before heading to the Licenses section, where a Pilot License will be available. You might have to work some part-time jobs or earn a scholarship to pay for the many hours of training here.

 Every Pilot License Exam Answer in BitLife 
          

There are four sections to the Pilot License exam in BitLife, including basic test questions, identifying a landing marker, recognizing an aircraft marshall signal, and naming piloting instruments. The quiz consists of simple multiple-choice questions that relate to real-world knowledge a Pilot would have to know. The marker and signal questions generate one symbol from a group to see if you recognize what they mean.



When you&#39;re given a landing marker to identify, there are three different symbols that could appear. Similarly, the same number of demonstrative images are given for the marshall signal portion of the test for you to recognize.

When asked, &#34;What does this airfield landing marker indicate?&#34; the symbol with the diagonal yellow line means &#34;Land Cautiously!&#34; The marker with two straight yellow lines stands for &#34;Emergency Landing Only!&#34; Finally, the last possible symbol with a yellow &#34;X&#34; across a red background indicates &#34;Landing Forbidden!&#34; in BitLife.

The next question for the Pilot exam in BitLife is, &#34;What is this aircraft marshaller signaling?&#34; which could show a figure raising their left arm and the orange wand toward their head for a plane to Turn Left. If the figure makes an &#34;X&#34; over their head, they want a Pilot to Stop. However, if both arms are being raised at the same time, this is a clear sign for someone flying an aircraft to Move Forward.

You then have to name a gyroscopic instrument and pitot-static instrument out of four different icons that appear for the last exam question. The one that looks like a clock is an Altimeter, while another with a plane in the middle is called a Heading Indicator. A Lean Indicator is an icon with an &#34;L&#34; and &#34;R&#34; on either side, while the Vertical Speed Indicator looks like a watch with one hand that measures Vertical Speed.




When you pass all the answers here in BitLife, you will earn a Pilot License, graduate from Flight School, and use your newfound knowledge to pursue a job that reflects your career path.
