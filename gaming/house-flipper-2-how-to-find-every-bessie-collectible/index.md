## Literature Review

Bessie the Beaver is a collectible waiting to be found across the story mode campaign of House Flipper 2 and can net the player an achievement.





With many of the improvements over the first game in House Flipper 2, players can do a few things they were not previously able to do, including build a custom house in Sandbox Mode and create or flip basements and bunkers. This gives players a lot of freedom to relax, unwind, and figure out whatever makes them most relaxed. With a lot of things to crack on with, completing this achievement as you play the Story Mode Campaign will tick one thing off the list a little quicker.




                  &#34;Built Better Than The Original&#34; - House Flipper 2 Review   The sequel to the 2018 House Flipping game is here and House Flipper 2 builds and improves on the original in many ways.   


 Finding All 9 Bessie Collectibles In House Flipper 2 
         

There are a total of nine Bessie Collectibles to find in House Flipper 2, and it will take some keen eyes to spot all of them. However, players will have to find them in the Story Mode, and they are usually in missions where players are flipping houses, not in the job-based missions near the start of the game. With that in mind, the table below lists the level it is found on and some notes as to where to find them in the level.



It is possible to replay individual missions without restarting the whole campaign from scratch, so if you have missed one already, it is not too late to go get them.







 Collectible  Mission  Where To Find   1  So You Wanna Be A House Flipper?  Go to the first bedroom on the left. To the left of the window is a shelf with a plant and a candle. Bessie is in between them.   2  I Have A New Quest For You  Open the garage door. At the back of the room is a shelving rack. Bessie is located on the top shelf in the middle cube.   3  Out With The Old!  Open the door to the front of the house. Almost immediately look to your left. Bessie will be on a table next to a rubber duck right by the window.   4  Tiny House To Flip  Once you get into the house, go toward the doors at the back of the room. Just before you reach them, turn left and look up. Bessie will be in a cube shelf near the ceiling.   5  My Crew Is Moving Here  Go up the stairs and open the door. The second door to the left is a laundry room. Inside, Bessie is sitting inside a wooden box next to a few buckets.   6  My House Doesn&#39;t Feel Like Home  Go inside and immediately go upstairs. At the top is a cube shelving unit next to the piano. Bessie is in the top shelf, the second cube from the left (if the player is standing next to the piano).   7  Making Room For Our New Baby  Go inside via the porch door. Inside is a living room with a couple of boxes of toys next to the fireplace. Inside the yellow box is the Bessie figurine.   8  Exterior Renovation  When you load into the level, go around the house to the back and go up the back stairs. The door leads inside to a bedroom. Bessie is sitting on the dresser next to a red lobster and a green frog.   9  Adding Music Studio  Enter the house and go to the kitchen. Bessie is waiting in the cupboard above the stand mixer, where she can be seen through the window of the cupboard door.   



And after you have grabbed the last Bessie Collectible, you will have earned the Full House achievement. There are still many more achievements and secrets to uncover in the neighborhood, but this trophy is a big one to finish. With every Bessie the Beaver in tow, players can continue pursuing the ultimate achievement of satisfying every buyer in House Flipper 2.
