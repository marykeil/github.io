# Get Ready To Uninstall All Your Games For Modern Warfare 3


## SUMMARY 



  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 requires an inordinately large amount of storage space, potentially exceeding 200 GB.   The game&#39;s file packaging method is frustrating, as it requires players to have Call of Duty HQ and Warzone installed, which feels unnecessary for a standalone title.   The storage space issue is not unique to Modern Warfare 3, as many modern games demand large installations, which can be a problem for consoles with limited storage capacity.

## Literature Review

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is going to take up an enormous amount of space – even for people who don&#39;t plan on buying the newest entry.




The release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is an exciting moment for fans of the series, but the basic requirements to install the game could quickly temper some of that anticipation. Call of Duty games have gotten increasingly difficult to set up on a system over the years, going from simple affairs packed into a few gigabytes of space to major graphical undertakings with complex launchers and frequent updates. Modern Warfare 3 makes some decisions that force more files on Modern Warfare 2 and 3 players alike, and it feels closer to a breaking point than ever before.




Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the second game to release under that name, taking the title of a 2011 entry in the franchise out for another spin. The new Modern Warfare titles aren&#39;t direct remakes, revisiting characters but telling a different storyline with separate gameplay prerogatives. Modern Warfare 3 focuses on the classic series antagonist Vladimir Makarov as the main villain, following Task Force 141 as they try to fight off his growing worldwide threat through a number of traditional levels as well as Open Combat Missions more focused on player choice.

                  &#34;Warfare That Feels Dated&#34; - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Review   Despite fantastic visuals, the campaign for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 fails to push the series forward with gameplay that feels dated.   


 Call Of Duty: MW3&#39;s File Size Wastes Space 
Modern Warfare 2 &amp; 3 Both Require Additional Files
         




The size of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 can differ wildly depending on the installation, but in any scenario, it&#39;s big. The Steam requirements for the title list 149 GB of SSD space as necessary if Call of Duty HQ and Warzone aren&#39;t already installed, which can downsize to a comparatively reasonable 78 GB of additional space if they are. Including an installation of Modern Warfare 2 in an overall count for the size the overarching Call of Duty launcher can take up could shoot this number well above 200 GB, a number that applies to consoles and PC alike.

The major source of this bloat is the unusual method of packaging the game, as there&#39;s no way to download Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 as a completely standalone title. The necessity of having Call of Duty HQ and Warzone installed allows Modern Warfare 3 to make use of a number of pre-existing assets and features, but it also results in a frustrating system that feels more appropriate for a DLC than for a new, numbered title. It also adds another step to launching the game or any others that use the hub, which can feel like a waste of time for anyone only interested in the new content.




                  When Modern Warfare 3 Unlocks (Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Launch Times)   Modern Warfare 3 is only a short way away, but its exact launch times vary by region and purchased edition. Here’s everything there is to know.   

What makes this system uniquely bad is that the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 update is pushed on all players, so continuing to play Modern Warfare 2 without buying the new game will still see a significant chunk of storage space tossed to the wind. It&#39;s hard to see this as anything but a flagrant disregard for the current user experience in favor of pushing new purchases. Tying sequels to previous games in forced ways has become something of the norm now, with Overwatch 2 and Counter-Strike 2 overwriting their predecessors, and this is another frustrating permutation of that unique form of aggression.



 How Call Of Duty HQ Works With Modern Warfare 3 
Call Of Duty HQ Features File Management
          




Activision has addressed concerns about the file size in a recent blog post available on the official Call of Duty website, which attempts to explain the purpose of Call of Duty HQ. The publisher refers to the progression compatibility system as Carry Forward and describes its utility as a way to bring inventory, weapon progression, and maps from Modern Warfare 2 over to Modern Warfare 3. This could be appealing for players invested in everything they&#39;ve purchased or unlocked in the previous title, but it also has the downside of removing the elements of a fresh start that have traditionally characterized each release.

                  Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - Release Date, Platforms &amp; Characters   Modern Warfare 3 has officially been announced, confirming the game&#39;s release date and hinting at a dark turn for the series&#39; characters.   

One aspect of the blog post that should come as a relief, as Activision also explains that Call of Duty HQ features a file management system that makes it possible to uninstall content to cut down on storage. This isn&#39;t going to get the overall size of the package down to anything particularly trim, but it does make it possible to remove any given mode if it&#39;s already been completed or is simply going untouched. There&#39;s no reason that this should be a task that can only be done after a forced install, however, and it could still require uninstalling other games beforehand for anything to work at all.






 Storage Space Is Becoming A Big Issue With Modern Games 
Modern Warfare 3 Isn&#39;t The Only Huge Game
          

Although the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 issue is uniquely annoying thanks to its reliance on systems that aren&#39;t necessarily wanted, it&#39;s far from the only modern game to demand an installation size that would have seemed ludicrous not very many years ago. Storage is cheaper than ever, but when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X come with around 800 GB of usable space, five or six games that command this much space could max it out. The situation is worse on the Xbox Series S, which has less than 400 GB of accessible storage to play current-generation games on.

In a way, this situation loops back around to the issue of small memory cards on early 3D consoles, but the storage of all information except for save files on the discs themselves meant that the affordability of memory cards could still be kept fairly low. It&#39;s also arguably worse on PC now than ever, especially when considering the system requirements that demand an SSD for storage. Many PCs feature a smaller SSD for the OS and key software and a larger HDD for general storage, so fitting more than one AAA release on a fairly average setup isn&#39;t always possible.




                  Modern Warfare 3: The Best Graphics (&amp; Performance) Settings For PC   To make sure your PC runs Modern Warfare 3 best, there are certain graphics and performance settings that shape the action into the best it can look.   

Buying the new Call of Duty every year has been a long-standing tradition for many fans of the series, and Modern Warfare 3 isn&#39;t likely to be a widespread exception to that rule. This is the first time, however, that so much baggage is associated with installing the game, and it doesn&#39;t paint a pretty picture of the franchise&#39;s future. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is way too big, and the justification for pushing extra files on players of both the new game and Modern Warfare 2 just isn&#39;t strong enough.
