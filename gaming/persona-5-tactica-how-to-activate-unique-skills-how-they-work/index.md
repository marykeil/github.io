## Literature Review

The different playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica all have personalized features, including Unique (Voltage) Skills, but they must be activated.





To raise the Voltage Meter, your character must either deal damage or take damage. Note that this meter is shared between the parties, so using it will use it up for everyone, not each character. Additionally, each party member&#39;s Unique Skill can be improved, increasing its effect.

                  All Persona 5 Tactica Playable Characters, Ranked   There are eight playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Hereâ€™s how they compare to each other.   


 How To Activate Unique Skills In Persona 5 Tactica 
         

Once the Voltage Guage has been maxed out, the Unique Skill is ready to be activated, but keep in mind that activating it as soon as it is ready is not always the best strategy. Since each skill has a specific purpose, it&#39;s best to figure out the optimal time to use it. For example, Joker&#39;s Unique Skill is great for setting up a Triple-Threat Attack in Persona 5 Tactica, so knowing that in advance can allow players to get the most out of that skill.

The Unique Skill, when available, will be marked with a star when pulling up the list of moves for a character. Note that Futaba is the only character that does not have a Unique Skill. However, her Hidden Book of Witchcraft and the Brightening Star Persona move can increase the rate at which the Voltage Meter fills up, which is, in some ways, even more useful than having a Unique Skill of her own.






The Voltage Meter progress will occur between story missions in Persona 5 Tactica but not between quests. So keep this in mind when considering saving it for later.
