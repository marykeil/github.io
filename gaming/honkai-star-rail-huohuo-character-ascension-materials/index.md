## Literature Review

Huohuo is a 5-star healer that you can obtain in Honkai: Star Rail. Here are all the materials you need to farm to fully level her and her abilities.





Huohuo uses Wind in combat and follows the Path of the Abundance. In essence, this means that she operates as the team’s healer. Huohuo actually heals her teammates and, in fact, is also capable of dispelling debuffs, making her a very valuable ally to have. Some bosses like Kafka or Phantylia in Honkai: Star Rail often apply debuffs that can be lethal to the party’s performance, so being able to get rid of debuffs before they get worse over time is crucial. Aside from healing, Huohuo also helps with Energy Regeneration and can buff her allies’ ATK, making her a well-rounded support hero.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Jingliu Character Ascension (&amp; Materials)   Fully Ascend and level Jingliu and her Traces to unlock her full powers as a DPS in Honkai: Star Rail. Here are all the required materials.   


 Ascension Materials To Farm For Huohuo In Honkai: Star Rail 
         

The first set of items you will need to farm when trying to ascend Huohuo is Immortal Scionette and its evolutions, Immortal Aeroblossom and Immortal Lumintwig, respectively. These items are often dropped by those who were cursed by Mara on the Xianzhou Luofu. Creatures that drop Immortal Scionette and its evolved forms include Abundance Sprites, Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, Mara-Struck Soldiers, and even the Ascended in Honkai: Star Rail. These opponents can be found in maps like Cloudford and Stargazer Navalia. A few more of the materials can be purchased from the Embers Exchange Store every month, too.






Numerous Immortal Scionette, Aeroblossom, and Lumintwig are needed for Huohuo’s Traces, so it is best if you farm a surplus of these materials.




As you progress further into Huohuo’s Ascension levels, rarer items are needed – this is when you will need to start using your Synthesizer to transform your Scionettes into Aeroblossoms, and Aeroblossoms into Lumintwigs. The second material needed is Ascendant Debris in Honkai: Star Rail. This item can only be obtained by challenging Shape of Celestial: Stagnant Shadow. A total of 65x is needed to complete Huohuo’s Ascension, so you will need to challenge the domain a few times. Because Trailblaze Power is limited, this process may take a few days, especially if you are in short supply.

The table below lists all of Huohuo’s material needs for her Ascension process in Honkai: Star Rail, divided by level. It also includes the rewards you can get:




 Huohuo Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Honkai: Star Rail   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    5x Immortal Scionette   4,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 30 Ascension    10x Immortal Scionette   8,000x Credits     -   Level 40 Ascension    6x Immortal Aeroblossom   3x Ascendant Debris   16,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 50 Ascension    9x Immortal Aeroblossom   7x Ascendant Debris   40,000x Credits     -   Level 60 Ascension    6x Immortal Lumintwig   20x Ascendant Debris   80,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 70 Ascension    9x Immortal Lumintwig   35x Ascendant Debris   160,000x Credits     -   Total Materials    15x Immortal Scionette   15x Immortal Aeroblossom   15x Immortal Lumintwig   65x Ascendant Debris   308,000x Credits       3x Star Rail Pass      



In addition to the aforementioned materials, you will need a grand total of 308,000x Credits to unlock all the Ascension thresholds preventing Huohuo from being raised to level 80 in a single swoop. This number does not consider the 580,100x Credits used to level the character with EXP items – she can be leveled without any cost, relying solely on EXP gained from battles, but this is a very time-consuming and ineffective way of leveling a character in Honkai: Star Rail. In case you are in need of extra Credits, you will need to farm Calyx (Golden): Bud of Treasures.






 Materials For Huohuo’s Trace’s (Abilities) In Honkai: Star Rail 
          

As was previously mentioned, you will need to farm a surplus of Immortal Scionette, Immortal Aeroblossom, and Immortal Lumintwig. These items are needed abundantly for Huohuo’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail, so a large amount will need to be gathered. For comparison, 56x Lumintwig is needed for all three of her Traces, as opposed to the 15x needed for her complete Ascension process. This does not consider the sum of Aeroblossoms and Scionettes, which are also highly required for her Traces.

The other core components of Huohuo’s Traces are Seed of Abundance, Sprout of Life, and Flower of Eternity. These three items integrate the Abundance item family and, so far, are exclusively used by characters that follow this Path. While a few of the basic materials can be obtained through the Embers Exchange Store, the most viable source of these items is through Calyx (Crimson): Bud of Abundance in Honkai: Star Rail. Running this challenge is the best way of farming Seed of Abundance and its evolved forms. A large sum is necessary, which means you may need to run the Calyx plenty of times.




Aside from the families of items that need to be abundantly farmed, the higher leveled Traces in Huohuo’s kit will need an item called Regret of Infinite Ochema. This item is a weekly boss material that drops from Phantylia. While not too many are needed, the boss will need to be challenged a few times to attend to the required amount – and given weekly restrictions on boss challenges in Honkai: Star Rail, it may take a few weeks to gather all the items. The last item needed, also for higher leveled Traces, is Tracks of Destiny.

The table below lists all the necessary materials to fully upgrade all of Huohuo’s Traces:

 Huohuo Trace Materials In Honkai: Star Rail   Immortal Scionette    41x      Immortal Aeroblossom    56x      Immortal Lumintwig    58x      Seed of Abundance    18x      Sprout of Life    69x      Flower of Eternity    139x      Regret of Infinite Ochema    12x      Tracks of Destiny    8x      Credit    3,000,000x      






You will also need a large sum of Credits to complete the Trace leveling process. All the materials needed for Huohuo were available in the game prior to the character’s own release so that they could be pre-farmed. The new 5-star Abundance character promises to be a great addition to the playable roster, as it still notably lacks more healer options. If properly built, she can supply the need for a Luocha in Honkai: Star Rail, for instance.
