## Literature Review

PlayStation has announced new suits will be coming to Spider-Man 2 via DLC, increasing the impressive number of suits available for both heroes.




PlayStation has confirmed new suits will be coming to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 in DLC. Currently, there are 39 available suits for Peter and another 39 for Miles, including the five for each hero that came with the Digital Deluxe Edition, and the pre-order exclusive suits. Many of these suits also come with an additional three &#34;suit styles.&#34; which are color variants to allow for further customization.




Unlocking suits has been a huge part of Insomniac Games&#39; Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series and offers a way for players to experience these games as their favorite Spider-Man from the character&#39;s six-decade-long history in media. Peter and Miles&#39; suits include classic comic book designs as well as the suits seen in movies and TV. On top of these, Insomniac has included a variety of completely new designs for both heroes.

  


 4 KidSuper Collaborations Are Coming To Spider-Man 2 
          

American artist, fashion designer, and musician, Colm Dillane (aka KidSuper) has announced a collaboration with PlayStation and three other artists on new DLC suits for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Through a series of videos on each of the artists&#39; X accounts and some concept art, a better idea has formed of what these suits will be.





 


 


 


 

Singer, actress, and model Rina Sawayama&#39;s Spider-Man design sees the hero sporting a Biker Outfit, with her expressing that &#34;leather is always sought after&#34; in a clip. Meanwhile, Formula 1&#39;s Lando Norris&#39; design incorporates a racing helmet, and footballer Vinicius Jr. represents his team and country, Brazil, through his design, which incorporates the colors of the country&#39;s flag. KidSuper then posted that working with these other artists gave him the bug to design his own, making a total of four new DLC suits coming to the game so far.






PlayStation has yet to announce if this will be paid DLC or a free update.




                  Every Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Suit For Peter &amp; Where It’s From   Including its pre-order content and Digital Deluxe Edition, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 features 39 different suits for Peter Parker to wear.    



 The Digital Deluxe Edition Featured 10 Original Suit Designs 
         

Insomniac has already formed collaborations to add many original suits to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 via collaborations so far. This was the case with the game&#39;s Digital Deluxe Edition, which had 5 original suits for Peter, and 5 for Miles. These suits were designed by a variety of guest artists from across comics, films, and PlayStation Studios.




                  Every Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Suit For Miles &amp; Where It’s From   Including pre-order content and the Digital Deluxe Edition, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 features 39 different suits for Miles Morales to wear.    



 Hopefully, Some Classic Spider-Man Designs Will Be Included Via DLC 
          

While the collaborations on new designs do bring something unique to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, fans are also hopeful that some more comic-favorite suits will be added to the games via DLC. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man added 9 extra suits in its paid The City That Never Sleeps DLC, and more via post-launch updates. Unfortunately, around 30 suits from Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, and 5 from Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales were not included in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.

This was for various reasons, such as ensuring both Peter and Miles had an equal number of suits, or because of how they looked with the new web wings mechanic. Other highly-requested classics like Ben Reilly&#39;s Sensational Spider-Man suit have yet to make an appearance in the series, so many are hopeful Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC will incorporate them as well.
