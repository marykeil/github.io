# Clever Baldur s Gate 3 Players Managed To Kill Unkillable Characters


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers enormous freedom to kill anyone, but some characters are meant to be invincible due to their power or storyline significance.   Players have discovered a trick using illithid powers to kill certain supposedly invincible characters, but it doesn&#39;t have much impact on the game&#39;s story or consequences.   The developers have been patching the game to fix such exploits, so players interested in trying this trick should do so soon.

## Literature Review

Finding out how to circumvent true invincibility in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the actual process is easy to execute now that it&#39;s been discovered.




The enormous freedom offered in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 means that it&#39;s possible to kill just about anyone in the game, but there&#39;s a small selection of characters who aren&#39;t intended to be so easily offed. A high fantasy world naturally features some creatures and beings that are more powerful than others, and immortality or something close to it isn&#39;t always out of the question. Thanks to the complex array of systems in the game, however, even a couple of characters that shouldn&#39;t be able to bite the dust can be permanently eliminated with the right trick.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 uses the fifth edition rules for tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a basis for its mechanics and rule set, and DnD features no shortage of unique ways to kill foes. Although Dungeon Masters can generally adjudicate the legality of exploits in tabletop play, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 lacks the same flexibility, so some imperfectly applied systems and unintended consequences don&#39;t end up meeting the expected resistance. Developer Larian Studios has put consistent work into patching up many of the holes since the game&#39;s official launch, but a dedicated community continues to find new tricks months from release.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Withers And Mizora Can Be Killed In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
         




The camp function primarily serves as a way to socialize with party members and take long rests in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it can also be home to a number of tag-along characters that serve interesting side roles. In theory, these figures should be easy to kill in an environment where no one will aggro on their behalf, but not all of them are actually meant to be mortal. Withers and Mizora might both look vulnerable at first glance, but tossing some spells or blades at either will quickly reveal that damage bounces off of them in different ways that leave them equally impregnable to attack.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3: How To Recruit Withers   The skeletal NPC Withers is a character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that helps you recruit Hirelings, or temporary additions to your party that help in battle.   

A method of getting around this obstacle has been discovered by determined players thanks to illithid powers, which can be accessed by any character willing to consume additional tadpoles to unlock unique features. Reddit user CAPHILL figured out the technique with Withers as a target and posted proof of the accomplishment, showing the basic quarterstaff that can be looted off of the NPC&#39;s otherwise empty inventory. This obviously isn&#39;t an advantageous decision to make, as having Withers around grants access to tools like resurrection, hirelings, and respeccing, but it&#39;s interesting that it can be done at all.





 

The key illithid powers to use are Ability Drain and Absorb Intellect, both of which make it possible to reduce a target&#39;s intelligence to 0. Bottoming out on this metric will instantly kill a character, and it seems to bypass the measures put in place to prevent the deaths of WIthers or Mizora through other means. The method&#39;s efficacy was subsequently tested on Mizora by Reddit user DTraitor, revealing that her own inventory features absolutely no rewards whatsoever.


 



 How Invincibility Works For Withers And Mizora In BG3 
          




Withers and Mizora might both be impossible to kill through the normal methods in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the ways in which they respond to attacks aren&#39;t the same. Withers features only 1 HP, but any typical attack on him will fail to do damage. He shrugs them off with wry comments, complimenting the attempt or deriding its obvious pointlessness. The real reason for this is his power being cloaked for most of the game, as the nature of Withers&#39;s identity in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t revealed until the finale, but his inability to be destroyed is an obvious clue that he&#39;s more than he appears.

Mizora has a higher HP stat, but it&#39;s still nothing extraordinary, sticking to 75 HP when she&#39;s hanging around the camp. Rather than simply standing around and taking attacks like Withers does, she instead avoids damage by disappearing to the Hells whenever she&#39;s attacked. It&#39;s only a temporary measure, as she&#39;ll quickly reappear in the camp, but even spells capable of dealing over 75 damage won&#39;t take. This unique feature is achieved through the Zariel&#39;s Protection condition, named after the archdevil ruler of Avernus who&#39;s clearly responsible for Mizora&#39;s invulnerability.






 Withers And Mizora Can&#39;t Truly Die In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Although draining the health of Withers and Mizora to remove them from the playing field is a neat Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 trick, the game still doesn&#39;t acknowledge it in the same way as most deaths. Neither of the characters will randomly reappear in the camp, but their roles in the story stick. Both Withers and Mizora are still capable of appearing in cutscenes after their untimely demises, and the story won&#39;t shift to acknowledge either death. Larian Studios isn&#39;t likely to ever add proper consequences, as the more probable patch would be removing the ability to kill them with illithid powers.

                  Was Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Really The Best Game Of 2023? Retrospective   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is an obvious choice for the year&#39;s best game, but declaring a single winner of such a prestigious title is rarely a simple affair.   




Unlike Withers, it&#39;s actually possible to properly kill Mizora before Act 3, as she can be exterminated in a mind flayer pod in Act 2. She still won&#39;t stay dead – as a cambion, she inevitably returns to life – but it does acknowledge the fact that she has, in fact, been killed. Taking this route will also cause Wyll to die as her warlock, which would also be a consequence of causing Mizora&#39;s death in camp if the exploit made sense within the lore. Unlike Mizora, Wyll can&#39;t be resurrected, so this isn&#39;t a good method of freeing him from his pact.



Killing Mizora in Act 2 will also cause extra challenges in Act 3, as the cambion doesn&#39;t take the affront lightly.




Anyone interested in trying out the exploit to kill Withers or Mizora should probably do so soon, as Larian Studios might well deploy a fix for it in a future patch. It&#39;s definitely best to keep a backup save file on hand, however, as there aren&#39;t any real advantages to the demise of either. More than anything else, discovering the trick is a testament to the ingenuity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players and the depth of interest that the game has managed to attract.
