# New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character


## SUMMARY 



  Release of a highly anticipated playable character in Genshin Impact may be delayed until after Version 5.0.   Leaks reveal information about the appearance and potential gameplay of a Fontainian goth girl character.   The delay in the release of the prison girl character is not surprising, as HoYoverse often introduces characters long after the introduction of a specific region.

## Literature Review

Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.




A new Genshin Impact leak bodes bad news for the release date of one long-awaited playable character. The popular live-service RPG by HoYoverse has been suffering leaks for years now, most of which detail the contents of the upcoming patches. In the next update, for instance, one of the most awaited playable characters, Xianyun (Cloud Retainer), was leaked before her release was later confirmed by the developer. There have also been Genshin Impact 4.4 skin leaks for three characters, two of which are expected to be premium items added to the in-game shop. Some of the playable content, such as new areas and NPCs, has also been revealed through leaks.




Leaks tend to be particularly heavy near the approach of an x.0 Version, which usually introduces a completely new region and roster of heroes. Before Version 4.0, for instance, there were not only multiple character leaks that showed the design of most of the characters from Fontaine but also leaks about several gameplay mechanics, from underwater exploration to the Pneumousia portion of the Arkhe system. Now, a new bit of information about a previously leaked Genshin Impact Fontaine character has arisen, and it seems like players will have to wait a lot longer to obtain and use her in combat than was expected.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Phase 1 Character Banners Make A Perfect Combo   The leaks regarding the character banner structure in Phase 1 of Genshin Impact 4.4 make a lot of sense, for both gameplay and lore alike.   


 Fontaine’s ‘Goth Prison Girl’ May Not Arrive Before Genshin Impact’s Natlan Release 
          




According to an alleged leak by Black Rose, later shared by a user on Reddit, the unnamed Fontainian character known popularly as “goth girl” or “prison girl” will not be released in 4.x. In essence, this means that players may not be able to obtain this character, who was leaked in mid-2023, before the arrival of Version 5.0. The update is expected to introduce the Pyro Nation of Natlan, so it may take even longer for players to actually see this Fontainian character. This is because HoYoverse will probably try to push new Natlan characters in the Genshin Impact banners during the first few updates after and including 5.0.



Previous rumors have also suggested the prison girl’s internal codename is “Demon” or “M.”






 What Is Known About Genshin Impact’s Prison Girl (So Far) 
          




As was previously reported, this prison girl character is from the region of Fontaine. So far, players have not encountered her as an NPC, and it does not seem like there have even been mentions of her existence yet. According to the leaks, the goth girl has a medium female body type, like Ganyu’s, and white skin. This leaked character wears a stylized red and black dress with long sleeves and red gloves. She dons knee-high black boots with a red ribbon at the top of each boot. The prison girl in Genshin Impact also has silver hair with two long ponytails and wears a black beret on her head.



If the goth girl character is real and has not been discarded, the final version of her design is still subject to change ahead of her official reveal.




In terms of gameplay, the information is a lot more scarce. Realsport101 mentions that the goth girl from Fontaine has a Pyro Vision. Her leaked concept art does, indeed, feature a Pyro Vision, but not one encased in Fontaine’s shape. Instead, the goth girl’s Vision is shown as a Mondstadt-based Vision. This does not necessarily mean she will be from the Mondstadt region in Genshin Impact, however. The first leaked design for Charlotte, for instance, featured her with a Cryo Vision in a Mondstadt casing, hung over her left shoulder. Not only did it change places but it was also adapted into a Fontaine Vision casing.




                  Genshin Impact 4.5 Leaks Reveal New Banner Characters   Even though Version 4.5 is still a ways away from arriving, there are already leaks regarding the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact.   



 Prison Girl’s Late Release In Genshin Impact Is Not Much Of A Surprise 
          

The fact that the prison girl’s release may not be as soon as anticipated does not come across as shocking. It is quite common for HoYoverse to hold back on character releases and introduce them a long time after a specific Nation has been introduced. The region of Liyue, for instance, has been available since launch, and in Version 4.4, the game is expected to get two new characters from Liyue (namely Xianyun and Gaming). As such, prison girl may likely be released over the next year, following the release of Natlan in Genshin Impact and maybe even after the conclusion of the arc set in the Nation of Pyro.






 Genshin Impact Is Still Missing The Release Of Other Fontaine Characters 
         

Even though the alleged leak about the prison girl’s release date may be bad news for players who were eagerly awaiting her, there are still many Fontaine characters that have yet to be released – some of which, may be introduced as playable before the arrival of Version 5.0. One such character is Clorinde. Though she has been introduced as an NPC in the story and has interacted with the Traveler multiple times, she has yet to become playable. There is no prediction as to when she will be added to Genshin Impact, however. The same can be said about the Fortress of Meropide’s head nurse, Sigewinne.

Another long-awaited character that has already appeared as an NPC and is rumored to eventually become playable is Arlecchino, also known as The Knave. Before the arrival of Version 4.0 and the region of Fontaine, there was speculation about her release in Version 4.3, but that was incorrect, as she is not playable yet. It is debatable if Arlecchino’s release in Genshin Impact will ever occur, but she is expected to become the third playable Harbinger – the first being Childe, followed by Wanderer, who is no longer affiliated with the Fatui.




In addition to characters that appeared as NPCs, there have also been leaks about another character codenamed Dahlia, also popularly known as “Heterochromia Boy” and “Elizabeth.” This hero is said to have a medium male body type and short pink hair. Their most notable feature is their different colored eyes: one is gray and the other is lilac. Like most characters in Genshin Impact so far, Dahlia also has white skin. They wear a custom suit and white shorts, as well as a black hat that seems to have cat-like ears on it. Dahlia is expected to be a Catalyst user in possession of a Hydro Vision.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   

With Chiori rumored to be introduced as playable in Version 4.5 and no signs of the leaked “mummy girl” so far, the release dates for new Fontaine characters remain uncertain. Nevertheless, it seems like HoYoverse will keep up its tactic of gradually adding new heroes from old regions even as the game progresses forward and into the new Nations of Teyvat in Genshin Impact.
