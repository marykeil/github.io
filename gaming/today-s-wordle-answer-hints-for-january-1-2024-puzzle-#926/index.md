## Literature Review

The very first Wordle for 2024 is available for fans to solve and we&#39;ve got the hints and fully spoiled answer for those who may need a little help.





Since the start of the game back in 2019 there has yet to be a repeated word and there are so many words that Wordle hasn&#39;t used yet. With this in mind, it&#39;s smart to use a starting word that hasn&#39;t already been an answer as the chance of scoring a Wordle win-in-one would increase.




                  10 Wordle Strategies To Keep Your Streak Alive   With six guesses and thousands of possible daily words, keeping a Wordle streak alive can be tricky. Here are some strategies players can follow.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer

The January 1st Wordle answer is MURAL.

For our first Wordle of the year, we used the starting word IRATE. This provided a few good clues with two misplaced letters, &#39;R&#39; and &#39;A&#39;. Shuffling them around a bit our second attempt was POLAR which locked in the &#39;A&#39; and added a new misplaced &#39;L&#39; to the mix.

With a very lucky third attempt, we scored our Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, MURAL.
