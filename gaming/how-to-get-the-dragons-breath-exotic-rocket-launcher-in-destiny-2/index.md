## Literature Review

Destiny 2’s Season of the Wish revamped a classic Destiny 1 weapon called Dragon’s Breath. Here’s how to get the Exotic and its Catalyst.





However, unlike many other Rocket Launchers in the game, Dragon’s Breath’s munitions do not simply explode upon contact with the enemy or surface. Instead, rounds fired by Dragon’s Breath stick to whatever they hit and periodically eject incendiary fuel that inflicts Scorch. The longer the Rocket Launcher goes without firing, the more fuel the following shot spreads – additionally, igniting nearby targets helps partially replenish the fuel used by Dragon’s Breath. This weapon goes along particularly well with Solar builds in Destiny 2, especially if you need a gun that can deal immense damage against stronger enemies or clear out groups of opponents.

 How To Unlock The Dragon’s Breath Exotic 
         

Before benefitting from the flame spread by the Rocket Launcher, you will need to unlock Dragon’s Breath in Destiny 2. Luckily, this should not be too difficult. During the Season of the Wish, which should last until June 4, 2024, you can obtain the Exotic weapon from the Season Pass. There are two copies of the weapon in the Pass, one in the F2P (free-to-play) track and the other in the premium track. If you purchase the Season Pass, you will get Dragon’s Breath immediately at Rank 1. This is one of the benefits of obtaining the premium track of the Pass in Season 23.






June 4, 2024, is the day when Destiny 2 kicks off Year 7 with The Final Shape expansion unless there are any additional delays. The new content was initially planned to be released on February 27, 2024.




The F2P copy of Dragon’s Breath is unlocked upon reaching Rank 35 on the Season Pass. If you did not purchase the premium track of the Pass, this is the only way of obtaining Dragon’s Breath during the Season of the Wish in Destiny 2. If you have purchased the Season Pass, you will unlock this second copy of Dragon’s Breath, which can then be stored in the Vault or given to a secondary character. As such, you can get two copies of the Exotic Rocket Launcher during Season of the Wish without spending any in-game resources.

If you are trying to get Dragon’s Breath after the end of the Season of the Wish, it is possible. You will, however, need to have purchased the Lightfall expansion for Destiny 2, as this grants access to the seasonal weapons of Year 6. Dragon’s Breath can be acquired in such a manner by heading over to the Tower and interacting with the Monument To Lost Lights – for reference, this is the sculpture between the Vaults. Within its menu, you must access Lightfall - Year 6 weapons. There, you will find Dragon’s Breath. You will need to use some materials, however.




The list below details the items you will need to have in hand to purchase the Exotic weapon from the Monument To Lost Lights:

  100,000x Glimmer   200x Legendary Shard   1x Exotic Cipher   1x Ascendant Shard  



Once Dragon’s Breath has been obtained at least once through whatever method is available, you can reacquire copies of the weapon from your Collections. Doing so will cost you 2,500 Glimmer and 20 Legendary Shards.






 How To Get Dragon’s Breath Catalyst 
          

Aside from the weapon, obtaining the Dragon’s Breath Catalyst in Destiny 2 is also intelligent, as it can increase the Exotic Rocket Launcher’s performance on the field. The Dragon’s Breath Catalyst, which upgrades the weapon to a Masterwork, unlocks a new perk for you to take advantage of: Dragon’s Breath will replenish its fuel faster, and defeating targets with it will cause them to drop Firesprites periodically – Firesprites are the Solar subclass pickups that have various effects depending on the mods you are using in your build. Picking it up can trigger Restoration for your character or help regenerate Grenade Energy.




You must finish a related mission to obtain the Dragon’s Breath Catalyst. The quest can be picked up from Banshee-44, the Gunsmith in the Tower. This mission is divided into three stages. The first stage needs you to defeat 50x Scorched targets, including 5x Scorched bosses. This does not need to be done with the Rocket Launcher and, instead, is more easily accomplished if using a Solar subclass with other Solar weapons, such as Destiny 2&#39;s Epochal Integration Hand Cannon. While utilizing Dragon’s Breath in the first stage of the mission is unnecessary, using the Rocket Launcher is vital to the second part.

In the second part of the Catalyst quest for the Dragon’s Breath Rocket Launcher, you will need to equip the Exotic weapon and generate 200 Calibration data. This data can be acquired from various tasks, including seasonal playlist activities, Vanguard Ops, and Gambit and Crucible matches. You can get additional Calibration data progress by completing harder activities, such as Nightfalls, winning matches, and defeating Guardians in Destiny 2. The second phase also requires you to defeat a set amount of targets with Dragon’s Breath. While unspecified by the game, around 150 targets must be defeated with the weapon.




The last part of the quest is returning to Banshee-44. This will grant you the Catalyst, but you need to activate its effects before equipping it. To do so, you must defeat an additional 100 targets with the Exotic Rocket Launcher. After this, you can properly equip the Catalyst to Dragon’s Breath and put its extra perk to good use. With its extension to fuel, Scorch can be inflicted upon enemies for longer, transforming the revamped version of Destiny 1’s Dragon’s Breath into a must-have for Solar builds in Destiny 2’s Season of the Wish.
