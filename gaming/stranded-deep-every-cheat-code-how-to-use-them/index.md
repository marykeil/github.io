## Literature Review

Stranded Deep can be a pretty difficult survival game for almost all players, but it is possible to make the game easier on both console and PC.





Keep in mind that there could be a lot of problems when players trigger Stranded Deep&#39;s cheats while playing. Some console commands may have unintended bugs or cause the game to crash unnecessarily. It should also be noted that not all of these commands have uses for the everyday player, but almost everyone can enjoy not being hurt in Stranded Deep by playing in God Mode.

While not having the proper resources in Stranded Deep is likely to get the player killed pretty quickly, all they have to do is be willing to input a few cheat codes to circumvent all of their problems. Unfortunately, activating cheats in Stranded Deep is really only an option for PC players. PS4 and Xbox One cheats for Stranded Deep don&#39;t exist in the same sense, but there are a few ways console players can make their time with the game easier.



 Stranded Deep Cheats on Xbox &amp; PlayStation? 
          

There are no Stranded Deep cheats for Xbox One or PS4 players. However, that doesn&#39;t mean console players don&#39;t have ways to make their own experiences a bit more personal. On PlayStation and Xbox, Stranded Deep allows players to enter their custom seed numbers on the Cartographer screen, which dictates the spawn points of every item and landmass in the game.
