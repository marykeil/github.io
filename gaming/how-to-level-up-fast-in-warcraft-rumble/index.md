## Literature Review

Warcraft Rumble may have multiple progressions systems, and by utilizing the right tricks, you can quickly level each one at the same time.





In Warcraft Rumble, you must first focus on leveling your overall account. Second, you need to look at leveling each individual unit you own. Finally, you can also level up the quality, or &#34;rarity&#34; of each unit to unlock talent slots, which essentially give them new powerful abilities.

 How to Level Up Your Account Fast 
          

Leveling your account in Warcraft Rumble should be your top priority. This is due to the fact that the higher your account level, the more gold and XP you receive when completing Quests, getting new units, and doing anything else in the game that rewards you with gold or XP; the game scales its rewards as your level increases. That is why you should prioritize leveling up your account over anything else.

Buying new units, increasing unit quality, and leveling your units is the quickest way to level your account in Warcraft Rumble. As a result, while you work to level the two other progression systems, you&#39;ll be actively working to increase your account level as well. The quickest way to actively boost your account level, however, is to purchase new minis.

There are 54 minis in the game, all of which can be purchased at the G.R.I.D. for 90 to 120 Gold.






 Fastest Method To Level Up Minis 
          

Although you will level and gain XP for using your units in combat, it&#39;s chump change in the short run. Instead, doing Quests is the fastest method to level up minis in Warcraft Rumble.

You unlock Quests after obtaining the 14 Onyxia Sigils, which is accomplished by completing the game&#39;s first 14 levels. Quests pit your team against one of your three minis; you choose which one. If you win, you will be returned to the Quest tab and will be able to claim XP for that mini. The higher the quality of the Quest, the more XP your mini will be rewarded. Furthermore, the higher your account level, the more XP your chosen mini will receive.






Completing Quests will also reward you with XP Tomes. This is essentially a free XP offer for one of two minis. Tomes can be used multiple times (usually three), and the larger they are, the more XP they grant.

 How to Quickly Increase A Mini&#39;s Rarity 
          

The last area of progression you need to focus on is upgrading your mini&#39;s rarity. The main way to increase a mini&#39;s rarity is to purchase the unit in the shop, even if you already own the character. Each time you do this, you&#39;ll receive a star. You need three stars to level the mini from Common to Uncommon rarity, 10 stars to advance from Uncommon to Rare, 25 stars for Rare to Epic, and another 25 stars to advance from Epic to Legendary.




By increasing your mini&#39;s rarity, it will gain a free level and, on occasion, a new talent. Essentially, talents give your minis new powerful abilities, and it&#39;s by far the fastest way to make your units stronger. Your first talent point is unlocked at the Uncommon rarity, followed by the next two at the Rare and Epic rarities. Again, simply leveling your unit and increasing its rarity will work to increase your account level in Warcraft Rumble.
