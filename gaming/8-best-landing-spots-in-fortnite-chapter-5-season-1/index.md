## Literature Review

Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 introduces a new island with a high-speed rail network, tough bosses, and excellent landing spots for players to try out.





Recent Fortnite Chapter 5 map leaks turned out to be surprisingly accurate, and there are a few interesting features for new and returning players to be aware of. Many areas of the island are now connected by high-speed rail, and you’ll find many of the game’s biggest locations are home to aggressive and hostile NPC bosses. These are all things to keep in mind when choosing the best landing spot.
            
 
 10 Games That Deserve Their OG Maps Just As Much As Fortnite 
Fortnite saw a player boom with the reintroduction of an iconic map. Some other franchises could see a similar boost with the return of classic maps.












 








 8  The Train 
Stage A Daring Train Robbery With Your Squad


 







Previous seasons of Fortnite had great landing spots, but The Train is perhaps the most unique landing spot ever introduced. Unlike other landing spots, it doesn’t stick to a single location and is constantly on the move, circling the whole island in just under ten minutes. There are stations to hop aboard all across the island, but you can also take the highly unconventional approach of landing straight on the Train.
This is difficult to pull off even under the best conditions, as the Train moves quickly, and you will need to get your timing absolutely spot on. However, you and your squad can receive great starting loot if you manage it. The Train features four basic chests and a large chest that eventually showers you with loot items after you hack it.
Landing on the Train can also prove risky. Unlike Fortnite’s other season-exclusive vehicles, players have no control over the Train, and it follows a predetermined route through areas that see a lot of player traffic. You’ll need to watch for other squads who might decide to hitch a ride to try and take your items.
You’ll also need to watch your Storm Circles to make sure the Train doesn’t pull you into danger. 






 7  The Island North Of Lavish Lair 
A Quieter Start With Plenty Of Forage
        

Named Locations and Landmarks on the Fortnite island all tend to share one quality: they’re always busy. As such, picking an unmarked area can give you and your squad some extra breathing room to loot and gear up without interruptions. Lots of players prefer a louder start, but quietly setting up while your opponents chip away at their own numbers is just as valid.
The island north of Lavish Lair is ideal if you prefer a stealthier approach. Its size means there are several loot chests to be found scattered around the area, which should be enough for a duo or a trio to fill a loadout. Unfortunately, loot drops are random in all but a few rare cases, so there’s no way to guarantee you’ll get your favorite guns.
Unvaulted items from Fortnite Season OG have gone back into the vault, but you’ll still find different variants of the same weapon type, whether you like shotguns or sniper rifles. 

The island also excels as a landing spot due to an unusual abundance of forage. Veteran players will already be familiar with harvesting Fortnite’s fruit and vegetables, and they’re a quick alternative to potions and bandages. The island has lots of Mushrooms, which raise your shields by 5 points each. It isn’t always easy to build shields in the early-game, but forage gives you the chance to protect yourself better. The island is also ideal for solo players.





 6  Hazy Hillside 
A Great Choice For Anyone In A Festive Mood
        

Located in the snowy biome to the south of Reckless Railways, Hazy Hillside brims with holiday spirit. It’s a medium-sized hamlet with several large buildings, all packed with loot. The buildings also have good verticality, creating some great sightlines for sniper rifles. It’s also fairly close to the center of the island, making it a popular landing spot. In summary, if you enjoy early-game firefights, then you won’t usually lack company at Hazy Hillside.
Assuming you emerge victorious, there are also good transport options to get your squad moving. There are usually cars available, and the Train runs just to the north through a tunnel that’s also home to Hope, one of Fortnite Chapter 5’s new NPCs. She’ll trade a Rift To Go and Grapple Blade for Gold Bars: both great items for traversal and combat.





 5  The Marigold 
Go On A Less Than Leisurely Cruise


 







Docked at the mouth of the river past Pleasant Piazza is The Marigold: a mega-yacht belonging to the Society. This mysterious faction has taken over several locations, and their henchmen and leaders will frequently challenge you and your squad. Luckily, by visiting The Marigold, you can take something from them instead.
The Marigold has surprisingly formidable defenses, including automated turrets and patrolling henchmen, but if you’re quick and clever, you can take them out and claim a whole yacht’s worth of loot for yourself. The ship has several decks, including a luxurious upper deck fit for high society. Below decks lies a prize that’s always worth claiming: a locked vault.
To open the locked vault on the Marigold, you’ll need to defeat a henchman and claim a Yacht Keycard. 

Unlike Fortnite’s other secret vaults, The Marigold’s vault isn’t sealed with puzzles. Once you open it, you’ll find a Rare Chest, which only drops Epic or Legendary-quality items and gear.





 4  Grand Glacier Hotel 
A Brief Stay In A High-Class Establishment
        

You can carry on the theme of challenging and robbing the Society by visiting the Grand Glacier Hotel, a premier establishment on the edge of a scenic glacier that drops off into a freezing-cold lake. Aside from spectacular views, you’ll also find lots of chests and weapons as ground loot.
However, you’ll need every item you can find. The hotel is a magnet for squads who love early-game firefights and a mad scramble for loot. Adding to the pressure are The Society’s own henchmen and the NPC boss Montague, who won’t hesitate to try and kill anyone who gets in their way. It’s an essential challenge for players who love combat.
Montague will rapidly regenerate his shields, making it tough for you to take him down. However, once you do, you can claim Montague’s Enforcer AR and his Society Medallion. This passively regenerates your shields over time, but also marks your rough location for other players. You’ll want to use the same tactics you may have used to beat Fortnite’s Highcard boss.





 3  Snooty Steppes 
Challenge A Familiar Face To Battle
        

Snooty Steppes is essentially a one-stop shop with everything you might need to score a Victory Royale. It’s dense and packed with loot, has a locked vault, and even features another unique NPC boss: Family Guy’s very own Peter Griffin. Peter’s presence makes it a must-visit location for any fans of the adult animated series, and even non-fans will want to challenge him at least once.
Opinions differ about whether Fortnite has a crossover problem, but Peter’s presence is a net positive for players who love rare gear. Like Montague, Peter will rapidly regenerate his shields and is tough to kill, but will also chase you down while shouting references from the show.
He drops a Society Medallion and Peter Griffin’s Hammer Pump Shotgun, a Mythic quality Shotgun that deals incredible damage. As a nice bonus, you can use the Society Medallion to open the vault at Snooty Steppes to receive additional items.





 2  Fencing Fields 
Enjoy A Stroll Through Fortnite’s Finest Orchards


 







Fencing Fields is a rather picturesque vineyard and orchard, with lovely low-rise farm buildings, a fine dining establishment, and a fountain square. Naturally, it also belongs to The Society, and you’ll need to fight off their henchmen and Nisha, another NPC boss to really make the most of this location.
Nisha drops Nisha’s Striker AR: a Mythic quality Assault Rifle, and her Society Medallion. 

You can grab plenty of loot from this location and explore the surrounding fields to collect Flowberries. These restore some shield hitpoints when consumed, but also grant you a temporary low-gravity effect that also removes fall damage. As a nice bonus, the fields all have additional loot chests you can crack open for even more loot. There are also ziplines heading south to the railway line.





 1  Reckless Railways 
The Heart Of Fortnite’s New Rail Network


 







Reckless Railways is home to Grand Station, the biggest station on the Fortnite island’s new railway line, and it’s one of the best places on the island to catch the Train. There’s also plenty of ground loot and chests inside the station itself, which tends to attract lots of players in every match. It’s the very definition of a hot zone, drawing in solo players and squads searching for battle throughout the game.
Reckless Railways is also home to Valeria, another Society NPC boss. Make sure to take her keycard and open her vault. 

Grand Station might be the centerpiece of this location, but there are also surrounding buildings that provide extra loot and cover. Winning firefights in Reckless Railways requires you to use your surroundings, losing your enemies behind buildings and taking advantage of close quarters and verticality. Facing west, you’ll find a massive open town square that allows any player with a sniper rifle to score elimination after elimination.
It’s also a good idea to keep an eye out for temporary locations such as Loot Islands, which appear at random and contain one of Fortnite’s Capture Points, which drop extremely rare loot. These are just some of the best landing spots in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1, and you’ll want to do your own exploring during your matches to find landing spots that best fit your playstyle.
