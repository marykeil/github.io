## Literature Review

The Finals is a brand-new F2P first-person shooter holding its open beta and has a ton of things that other FPS games seem to seriously lack.




The Finals is the latest free-to-play FPS offering from the relatively new Embark Studios, creators of the 2019 ARC Raiders. Its open beta period has already attracted many to the title, and for a good reason, as its renewed take on the genre is likely to mix up the shooter industry, at least to some extent. A mixture of Apex Legends, Fortnite, and other popular first-person shooters, The Finals sets people in the shoes of contestants of a VR game show in a futuristic, money-centric dystopia, where players battle it out across vivid environments for the grand prize.
The Finals, at its heart, is a team-based multiplayer shooter where people team up in teams of three and load into a game to take on other players. In addition to a quick play mode during the open beta, there are also tournament modes, where winning as the top team qualifies players for the next bracket. While an official release date for the full release has yet to be set, the open beta for the game will continue until November 5, 2023. Here are some ways that The Finals sticks out from other games in the shooter genre.
            
 
 Does The Finals Have Crossplay And Cross-Progression? 
The Finals is a new FPS game currently in open beta and can be played with friends. Here is whether it has cross-platform functionalities or not.













 








 10  The Finals Is A Quick Download 
Open Beta Is Less Than 20 GB


 







While it&#39;s not an actual gameplay feature, game sizes, specifically for FPS titles, have ballooned over the years, with games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare exceeding 125 GB. Though it&#39;s not an issue for those with large hard drives, for others, like people on the Xbox S, conserving space for games is at the front of mind, and the fact that the game is so small even though the open beta is essentially a full game is certainly a nice feature. Hopefully, this will carry over into the full release so that more people with different platforms can enjoy the game.
The full release of The Finals will likely be larger than 20 GB. 






 9  Build Options For Different Gameplay Preferences 
Light, Heavy, Medium
        

In The Finals, one of the first things that most will do is select a preferred build from light, medium, and heavy options. This dictates speed and maximum momentum but also affects the abilities and weapons obtainable. While many FPS games prefer to adjust movement speed based on a gun, The Finals has variable movement speeds based on build, lending itself to people of different gameplay preferences and styles. While this is certainly nothing new for games in general, it&#39;s a place that FPS titles tend not to go for the sake of balance.





 8  Fluid, Fast-Paced Movement 
Gadgets For Mobility
        

While the closed beta of The Finals suffered from what many claimed to be delayed inputs, the open beta fixed many of those issues, resulting in some of the most fluid movement in a shooter. On top of that, there are several mobility Gadgets that can be obtained, from communal ziplines and grappling hooks to launch pads, furthering the possibilities for movement in the game. While a lumbering heavy might not feel great to play, light classes and the game&#39;s slide mechanic make it feel better than many other AAA shooters out there.





 7  Gameplay Loop Encourages Engagements 
Cash Out Forces Combat


 







While games in the Battle Royale genre have solved the issue of just camping until the end of the round with an ever-closing circle, The Finals approaches things in a more creative way by forcing teams to compete for money vaults across the map, creating temporary points of interest to battle over.
The basic premise behind the Cash Out game mode in The Finals is to find a cash safe and then cash it out while other teams are trying to steal it. While it&#39;s not a wholly unique concept to have a &#34;capture point&#34; type game mode in a first-person shooter, how The Finals employs it is an interesting change of pace and in line with the game&#39;s story and aesthetic.





 6  The Finals Is Free To Play 
Free On Full Release
        

While it isn&#39;t unique in being a free-to-play shooter, as a plethora of other franchises, including games like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Counter-Strike, have already proved the model to be successful, a multiplayer shooter with this level of detail being free-to-play at launch sets it apart from many other multiplayer shooters on the market right now. While other franchises did jump on the F2P model, the fact that The Finals is debuting completely free-to-play with no pay-to-win mechanisms is a great benefit to those on a limited budget and not something that all studios are willing to take a risk on, especially a newer one.





 5  Frenetic And Intense Gunplay 
20 Different Weapons
        

The commentator, EDM soundtrack, and visuals of the game culminate together to create a serious sense of urgency in The Finals. While other shooters have tried to achieve similar results using similar means, the game is able to blend this to make it fit the game&#39;s setting and themes in a way that feels more seamless than other titles. Though there are certainly points of downtime in the game, during battle, it&#39;s likely to be an intense time, especially when challenging for cash outs.





 4  The Finals Has Style 
Eye-Catching Visuals And Mechanics
        

Though certainly not everyone will agree, The Finals does maintain a futuristic dystopian aesthetic that other shooters haven&#39;t fully explored. While hi-tech futuristic themes have been prevalent in shooters for decades, they usually maintain a pretty serious science-fiction tone. The Finals has a sleek presentation, immersing players in a virtual reality game show that stands as the premise for the death match. Even on lower graphical settings, the game looks great, and the high-flying acrobatic moves accompany the detailed environment for pleasing visuals.
Though it&#39;s undeniable that some of the voice lines sound strange and robotic, this is something that Embark can easily fix by employing real voice actors for the full release of the game.





 3  Crossplay And Cross Progression 
Xbox X/S, PlayStation 5, PC
        

While other FPS games like Apex Legends and Call of Duty have crossplay and cross-progression enabled, it&#39;s not always something that accompanies the launch of a new game or FPS. This is a relatively new trend, but one that enables friends with any platform to connect to enjoy the game together. The fact that full crossplay and cross-progression are enabled for The Finals on launch is something to be celebrated, as other games have opted to go the PC-only route for years before adapting their games for consoles.





 2  Good Shooter Foundations 
Latency And Hitboxes Aren&#39;t Usually An Issue
        

While experiences will vary, especially depending on the type of internet or region, for the most part, The Finals appears to have pretty good latency and hitboxes. Shots to the head have the typical multiplier effect, but shooting generally feels both responsive and good. Though time-to-kill might be a bit long for many, especially against the bullet sponges that are heavy builds, it&#39;s not dissimilar to other games where armor is obtainable, like Fortnite or COD: Warzone.





 1  Fully Destructible Environments 
Complete Building Demolition Is Possible


 







Perhaps the best feature of The Finals is the fully destructible environments in the game. While other games, notably titles like Rainbow 6 Siege, have implemented wall destruction to create unique angles, arguably no other game has done building destruction to the scale found in The Finals.
In addition to having items that can be shifted and picked up throughout the levels of the game, players can also destroy rooms and, at times, entire buildings. This is most noticeable on the map of Monaco, which features rows of apartment buildings that can be demolished to their foundations.
Though Embark has yet to announce the official full release date of The Finals, this latest open beta was a great test and indicates that the developers are pretty far along in the process. Though the game is not perfect by any means, it does possess a lot of really cool ideas and alters tried-and-true FPS mechanics to fit within the unique universe they&#39;ve made.
Embark Studios, developers of The Finals, uses a mixture of AI-generated audio, professional voice actors, and in-studio recordings for voices in the game, according to reporting from IGN.
