## Literature Review

Completing the Winter Mystery Quest in Stardew Valley is quick and easy during your first year on your family&#39;s farm and provides an important gift.





The Winter Mystery Quest is very short and can be done through daily chores at the farm and in the local town. Unless you&#39;re very engaged in the storyline, you might even miss what happens. Make sure to take the time to learn about the lore and manage your farm and time better in your first year in Stardew Valley.

 How To Unlock The Winter Mystery Quest 
          

The Winter Mystery Quest can be started once your farm reaches year one&#39;s winter season in Stardew Valley. As soon as your character wakes up for the day, head on over to the Bu Stop. While everything is covered in snow, a &#34;suspicious figure&#34; stands out and looks like a black ghost with legs. The Ghost will then get startled and run off towards the local town. Make sure to get this done between 6 am and 4 pm, or you will have to do it the day after or until winter returns again next year.

After unlocking and beginning the Winter Mystery Quest in Stardew Valley, you will need to follow the &#34;suspicious figure&#34; to the town. Coincidentally, the snow had left his footprints leading to the north of the city near a playground and a few bushes. However, before heading to the playground, take a peek behind all the bushes around you until the &#34;suspicious figure&#34; pops out again with an anxious look. He will then gift the player with the Magnifying Glass.
