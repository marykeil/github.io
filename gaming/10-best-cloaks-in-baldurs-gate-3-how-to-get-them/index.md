## Literature Review

Finding the right gear in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is essential, and as well as weapons and armor there are some great cloaks for the party to seek out.





[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
With only 17 cloaks in the entire game, choosing the right one becomes an even more difficult task. While many of the cloaks here can be bought from merchants, some are a little harder to find. While none of the cloaks here are legendary armor in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 there are still some impressive pieces of equipment to help the party.









 








 10  The Cindermoth Cloak 
Looted In Act 3


 







The Cindermoth Cloak is an uncommon item that can be looted from Aelis Siryasius in the Lower City Sewers in Act 3. The Cindermoth Cloak sets fire to any creature that damages the wearer as long as they are within two meters. The strange half-drow sorcerer will drop the cloak if he is fought, which is not a simple fight considering all the grease elementals surrounding him.
Aelis will initially be neutral to the party and will only become hostile if a skill check is failed at which point he will attack. 

            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.









 9  The Shade-Slayer Cloak 
Purchased In Act 3
        

The Shade-Slayer Cloak is very rare also and can be found in the Lower City Sewers in Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The cloak is sold by the unfortunately named Sticky Dondo, a human child working in the Guildhall, close to where the party can find Mol for her quest.
The Shade-Slayer Cloak is fantastic for rogues as it reduces the number needed for a critical hit by one while the wearer is hiding, and even better this effect can stack with other effects or items that give the same bonus.





 8  The Reverse Rain Cloak 
Reward In Act 3
        

The Reverse Rain Cloak is an uncommon cloak won from Akabi&#39;s Wheel of Fortune at the Circus of the Last Days in Act 3. While most of the wheel&#39;s prizes are meant to be useless the Reverse Rain Cloak is the possible exception. The cloak permanently gives the wearer the wet condition, which would likely be uncomfortable in real life, however in BG3 makes them immune to burning and resistant to fire damage. The trade-off is that cold and lightning damage is doubled, but as fire is much more likely to be encountered, the cloak is worth grabbing.
The Reverse Rain Cloak strangely acts as an upgraded version of the Wavemother&#39;s Cloak which grants the same resistances/vulnerabilities but only until the wearer takes damage. 






 7  The Cloak of the Weave 
Purchased In Act 3


 







The Cloak of the Weave is a very rare cloak that can be purchased from Helsik in Act 3. The cloak is perfect for BG3 spellcasters as it allows them to take magical damage and add it to their next attack using absorb elements, as well as giving a plus one bonus to spell attack rolls and spell save DCs. Helsik runs the Devil&#39;s Fee magic shop and will not immediately show her full inventory to new customers.
To see her full stock, including the Cloak of the Weave, the party will need to take a good look around her shop, passing several perception checks to notice key items. After returning to Helsik and passing a Persuasion check, the party can ask her to help them get into the House of Hope. After agreeing terms with her the party can now request to see &#39;the good stuff&#39; and Helsik will show her true inventory.





 6  The Cloak of Protection 
Purchased In Act 2
        

The Cloak of Protection is an uncommon cloak found in Act 2 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This stylish item gives its wearer plus one to their armor class and saving throws, making it very useful early on. The Cloak of Protection can be bought from Quartermaster Talli at the Last Light Inn, almost directly opposite the waypoint sigil.





 5  The Deathstalker Mantle 
Reward In Act 1
        

The Deathstalker Mantle is a cloak that is only available for those playing as the Dark Urge BG3 origin. The cloak is a &#39;reward&#39; from the Dark Urge&#39;s butler Sceleritas Fel after poor Alfira is horrifically murdered. The Deathstalker Mantle itself is a rare cloak that allows the wearer to turn invisible for two turns after killing an enemy, perfect for rogues or those leaning into their darker urges.
There is a way to save Alfira and still gain the Deathstalker Mantle as well as Alfira&#39;s Act 2 reward of the Potent Robe. 






 4  The Cloak of Cunning Brume 
Purchased In Act 2
        

The Cloak of Cunning Brume is an uncommon cloak available for purchase in Act 2 of BG3. Another great cloak for rogues and more stealth based characters as this cloak creates a fog cloud to hide the wearer from sight for one round when the wearer uses the disengage action. The Cloak of Cunning Brume can be bought from Mattis in the Last Light Inn, provided that Rolan was convinced to stay with the tieflings in Act 1.





 3  The Derivation Cloak 
Looted In Act 2
        

The Derivation Cloak is a rare item found in Balthazar&#39;s quarters in Moonrise Towers. The cloak can be looted from a locked chest in the creepy chambers, to the right of Balthazar&#39;s telescope. The Derivation Cloak allows the wearer to heal themselves for 1d4 hit points whenever they poison an enemy.
            
 
 How To Beat Balthazar In Baldur’s Gate 3 
Balthazar is a tough spellcasting boss you can try to beat at two different points in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but his summoned undead make it a tricky fight.









 2  The Cloak of Displacement 
Purchased In Act 3
        

The Cloak of Displacement is a rare cloak that can be bought early in Act 3 of BG3. This cloak activates at the start of its wearer&#39;s turn, imposing disadvantage on enemy attack rolls against that character. This lasts until the wearer takes damage and works well for spellcasters with concentration spells.
The Cloak of Displacement can be bought from Entharl Danthelon, who runs Danthelon&#39;s Dancing Axe in Wyrm&#39;s Crossing, close to Rivington.





 1  The Vivacious Cloak 
Looted In Act 2


 







Finally, the Vivacious Cloak is an uncommon cloak that can be looted in Act 2 of Baldur’s Gate 3. While wearing this cloak, a spellcaster can get eight temporary hit points when they cast a spell while an enemy is in melee range. This can provide a little extra boost for squishier classes for when enemies get too close, making them more likely to survive a fight.
The Vivacious Cloak can be found in the east wing of the first area of the Grand Mausoleum, in a locked chest, in the Shadow-Cursed Lands.
