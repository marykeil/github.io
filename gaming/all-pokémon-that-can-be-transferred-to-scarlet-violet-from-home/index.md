## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are getting over 100 creatures and forms not previously obtainable in the Generation 9 games. Here are all of them.




Over a year after the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the games&#39; compatibility with Pokémon HOME has finally arrived. This feature allows a wide roster of Pokémon available in HOME to be transferred over to Scarlet and Violet, which, in turn, allows players to expand the number of creatures available to them in the franchise&#39;s most recent console release. Since players can store Pokémon caught in other games in Pokémon HOME, this feature allows the monsters not otherwise obtainable in Scarlet and Violet to be accessed by players who have obtained them in other titles from previous Generations.




This roster includes the regional Alolan variant for Raichu, for instance, and even a few Legendaries that are not normally available in Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Paldea. Many beloved starter Pokémon have also been added through the game and service’s compatibility. Additionally, several other creatures were confirmed as available in Generation 9 following the release of The Teal Mask and the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet through the compatibility with HOME. Some examples are the previously absent Hoenn starters. Even with the arrival of The Indigo Disk, there are still Pokémon missing from the Nintendo Switch, but that can be solved with some time. 


 Pokémon Highlights In Scarlet &amp; Violet To HOME Connection 
          

There are over a hundred Pokémon or forms that are not part of the regional Paldean Pokédex or not traditionally obtainable, but are now transferable from Pokémon HOME to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Notably, there are Legendaries and Mythicals from the Kanto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Galar regions, for example. Fan favorites Diancie and Volcanion are making a return to the mainline series, while the Creation Trio from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina) is also back. However, some ordinary creatures steal the spotlight, like Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ Hisuian version of Typhlosion or Ursaluna.






 All Pokémon Transferable To Scarlet &amp; Violet From Pokémon HOME 
         

The Pokémon transferable from Pokémon HOME to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are many, with a big portion of this lineup being composed of regional or variant forms of existing creatures. While it is possible to obtain a Johtonian Wooper in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, for example, only one is available. Even if it breeds with a Ditto, its offspring will be a Paldean Wooper. Now that transfers from Pokémon HOME have been made available, players will be able to transfer Johtonian Wooper regularly into Scarlet and Violet.

The list below disregards creatures that returned with the release of the Teal Mask DLC and that compose the in-game Pokédex. The focus is on Pokémon that are not listed in the games, but can be used via transferred into Scarlet and Violet via Pokémon Home:




 Generation  Pokémon   1 - Kanto    Charmander   Charmeleon   Charizard   Pikachu (8 Hat Variants)   Raichu (Alola Form)   Diglett (Alola Form)   Dugtrio (Alola Form)   Meowth (Alola and Galar Forms)   Persian (Alola Form)   Growlithe (Hisui Form)   Arcanine (Hisui Form)   Slowpoke (Galar Form)   Slowbro (Galar Form)   Grimer (Alola Form)   Muk (Alola Form)   Voltorb (Hisui Form)   Electrode (Hisui Form)   Tauros (Kanto Form)   Articuno (Kanto and Galar Forms)   Zapdos (Kanto and Galar Forms)   Moltres (Kanto and Galar Forms)   Mewtwo   Mew      2 - Johto    Cyndaquil   Quilava   Typhlosion (Johto and Hisui Forms)   Wooper (Johto Form)   Quagsire   Slowking (Galar Form)   Qwilfish (Hisui Form)   Sneasel (Hisui Form)      3 - Hoenn    Kyogre   Groudon   Rayquaza   Jirachi      4 - Sinnoh    Turtwig   Grotle   Torterra   Chimchar   Monferno   Infernape   Piplup   Prinplup   Empoleon   Phione   Manaphy   Uxie   Mesprit   Azelf   Dialga (Origin and Primary Forms)   Palkia (Origin and Primary Forms)   Heatran   Giratina (Altered and Origin Forms)   Cresselia   Darkrai   Shaymin   Arceus (All 18 Forms)      5 - Unova    Oshawott   Dewott   Samurott (Kalos and Hisui Forms)   Lilligant (Hisui Form)   Basculin (Hisui Form)   Zorua (Hisui Form)   Zoroark (Hisui Form)   Tornadus (Incarnate and Theriane Forms)   Thundurus (Incarnate and Theriane Forms)   Landorus (Incarnate and Theriane Forms)   Meloetta (Aria and Pirouette Forms)      6 - Kalos    Chespin   Quilladin   Chesnaught   Fennekin   Braixen   Delphox   Froakie   Frogadier   Greninja   Vivillon (Kalos Form)   Carbink   Avalugg (Hisui Form)   Diancie   Hoopa   Volcanion      7 - Alola    Rowlett   Dartrix   Dedidueye (Alola and Hisui Forms)   Magearna      8 - Galar    Grookey   Thwackey   Rillaboom   Scorbunny   Raboot   Cinderace   Sobble   Drizzile   Inteleon   Perserker   Zacian   Zamazenta   Eternatus   Kubfu   Urshifu (Single-Strike and Rapid Strike Styles)   Zarude   Regieleki   Regidrago   Glastrier   Spectrier   Calyrex (Classic, Ice Rider, and Shadow Rider Forms)      8 - Hisui    Wyrdeer   Kleavor   Ursaluna (Regular and Bloodmoon Forms)   Basculegion   Sneasler   Overqwil   Enamorus (Incarnate and Therian Forms)      



While some Gens and regions are more represented when it comes to transferable Pokémon from HOME to Scarlet and Violet, like Kanto, Unova, Kalos, and Galar, a few others fall on the short end of the list. Johto, Hoenn, and Alola have an underwhelming number of creatures that can be used within the Gen 9 games, which may upset fans of those respective regions. However, the addition of new and returning Pokémon in the Teal Mask significantly expanded the number of creatures compatible with the first Gen 9 games. The same will happen with the release of The Indigo Disk DLC in December.




Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s second expansion, part of the two-part DLC pack, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, arrives on December 14. The complete roster of new and returning Pokémon in Indigo Disk has not yet been revealed, but there will be a fair share of creatures. Although many details are still a secret, leaks indicate interesting possibilities like a return of all starter Pokémon. This follows up on Pokémon Sword and Shield&#39;s DLC, which likewise expanded its Pokédex. The Crown Tundra added many Legendaries from previous Generations with Max Raid Lairs, which put Trainers in a dungeon that led up to a Legendary that could be caught.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s connection to Pokémon HOME allows the games to have over 100 new Pokémon, considering alternative forms and creatures that are not obtainable in Paldea alike. While some regions may disappoint with a small list of Pokémon, it is a considerable feat that Scarlet and Violet will have almost half of all the creatures ever released in only two games. The Gen 9 games seem to replicate what Pokémon Sword and Shield did with Pokémon HOME, which saw 80 different Pokémon transferable to the Gen 8 games. Following the release of Indigo Disk, according to leaks, only 10 Pokémon will be missing from the Nintendo Switch system.






Despite the fact that they can be stored in Pokémon HOME, these 10 creatures have not been made compatible with any of the core games so far. There is a chance they may appear in the future with the long-rumored Gen 5 Pokémon remakes.




Between both of these new avenues for expanding the Pokédex in Scarlet and Violet, it&#39;s become clear that fans can keep themselves entertained with this Generation for some time yet. The new games have been an outstanding commercial success, despite the major criticisms regarding their technical quality. As such, it’s possible that Nintendo tries to make Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s lifespan longer than previous Generations&#39;. The main way to do that is by giving players Pokémon to catch, even if they are older ones returning through expansion packs or simply made compatible by transferences made with Pokémon HOME.
