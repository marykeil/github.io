## Literature Review

It seems like Xiao is getting a rerun in Genshin Impact.  That may actually be great news, as he allegedly pairs up well with a new character.




There are a few Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks pointing toward a rerun banner for Xiao, and that piece of information actually aligns perfectly with another leak regarding the upcoming Version. Xiao is an Anemo DPS character from Liyue and one of the first premium 5-star heroes introduced in the game. The yaksha was first added as a playable character in February 2021 and has since had three reruns. At launch, Xiao in Genshin Impact was highly regarded as one of the strongest DPS heroes in the game. Though that reputation has since vanished with the release of several new heroes, his next rerun may actually be his best installment.




While Wanderer is often regarded as the main new Anemo DPS – mostly due to his ability to trigger Swirl reactions from Normal and Charged Attacks since he is a catalyst user – the fact is that the element is not as popular as it was before. With the release of Dendro in Version 3.0, many of its related reactions like Hyperbloom became more important. Anemo is still widely used, but often as a support Element for stronger reactions in Genshin Impact. Now, however, it seems like Anemo and Xiao will once again be put in the spotlight, and it may just be enough to make him worth pulling for.

 : Genshin Impact 4.3 Leaks: Phase 2 Banners Suddenly Make A Lot More Sense


 Xiao May Rerun In Genshin Impact 4.4 
         

Previous leaks about Genshin Impact 4.4 character banners, as reported by Game Rant, hinted at a Xiao rerun during the update. While there have not been any more leaks regarding the matter, the DPS does seem like a safe bet for a rerun. Since his release, Xiao has been present in every version that is related to the annual Lantern Rite. Although the event and his debut happened in Version 1.3, Xiao has rerun in Version 2.4 and 3.4 banners, which lined up with the Festival. It is expected that the event will happen in Version 4.4 and, with it, Xiao will be featured as a rerun character once again.






This does not mean that Xiao does not appear in Version unrelated to the Lantern Rite Festival – the character reran in Version 2.7, for instance. However, so far, Xiao has been present in every patch that hosted the event.






 Xiao May Work With Cloud Retainer In Genshin Impact 4.4 
          

In addition to the annual tradition of seeing the Lantern Rite Festival accompanied by a rerun banner of Xiao, there is yet another and more important reason to believe that the Anemo DPS will reappear in Version 4.4. According to a few leaks about Cloud Retainer in Genshin Impact 4.4, which were shared by Sportskeeda, the crane-like adeptus from Liyue will make her debut as a playable character in the update, and her kit is, allegedly, used in a team comp with Xiao. Her anticipated human form is expected to conveniently be released in Version 4.4 and the Lantern Rite, which adds credibility to her alleged release date.




As reported by Sportskeeda, leaks indicate that Cloud Retainer will be a support and sub-DPS unit in Genshin Impact team comps. While it is uncertain if her Vision will be Anemo, it does seem like that is the element she will control, according to both leaks and speculation around her lore as a crane-like adeptus figure. Cloud Retainer’s Elemental Burst will, allegedly, create an AoE (area of effect) Anemo field, which will Swirl any elements inside. From the description, it could be something akin to Kazuha’s Elemental Burst. However, the leaks indicate that this field will also be able to subtly heal the party.



There are rumors about her being a Cryo character considering both Ganyu and Shenhe are her disciples. However, the mention of Anemo in her leaks makes it less likely for now.




Cloud Retainer’s Elemental Skill will, according to the Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks, allow her to fly. The nature of this flight ability and what it does exactly is still unknown. However, what seems most important in her gameplay kit – and what makes her a great pair for Xiao – is an innate ability. As mentioned in the leaks, Cloud Retainer will build up stacks whenever any of her party members’ HP is lost or restored. After some time, these stacks will be consumed and Cloud Retainer will reduce the enemy’s Defense. With an enemy’s Defense stat reduced, the team’s DPS will be able to deliver more damage.




With Xiao being a DPS that relies heavily on his own HP loss and a strong healer’s restoration, there is no wonder why Cloud Retainer is a great ally for him in Genshin Impact. Xiao’s Burst consumes his HP constantly in his Bane Of All Evil state, and having a healer to trigger HP restoration will make his HP fluctuate, thus continuously providing Cloud Retainer with what she needs to trigger the Defense debuff against enemies. With less Defense, opponents will, in turn, sustain more damage from Xiao’s attacks, which makes him a more effective DPS on the field.

Another great reason to put Xiao and Cloud Retainer on the same team is the Elemental Resonance in Genshin Impact. If the playable version of Cloud Retainer is, in fact, an Anemo character, using her with Xiao will trigger the Impetuous Winds Anemo Resonance. This effect decreases the party’s Stamina consumption by 15%, increases the Movement Speed by 10%, and shortens the Skill cooldown by 5%. All of these are great bonuses for Xiao – the decreased Stamina consumption and the improved Movement Speed will grant him better chances of dodging attacks, and the cooldown will allow him to use his Skill more frequently.




Of course, other HP-loss characters in Genshin Impact could also benefit from Cloud Retainer’s Defense debuff against enemies – but heroes like Hu Tao and Neuvillette would not activate the Synergy with Cloud Retainer. Regardless, leaks, rumors, and speculation about upcoming content should always be taken with a grain of salt. Information can be incorrect or subject to change ahead of the Version’s release. However, if the leaks are true, it seems like Xiao’s rerun in Genshin Impact 4.4 will be his best to date – and accompanied by Cloud Retainer, he may return to his station as one of the best DPS characters in the game.
