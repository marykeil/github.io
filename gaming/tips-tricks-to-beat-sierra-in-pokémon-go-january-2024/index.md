## Literature Review

Team GO Rocket Leader Sierra returns for trainers to face in Pokémon GO this January 2024 and using the right line-up is key to winning.





You will need to beat Sierra, along with Cliff and Arlo to be able to challenge Team GO Boss Giovanni this January. Sierra&#39;s team has changed in recent months, but she will pick from the same seven Pokémon that she had to choose from in December 2023.

 Sierra&#39;s Team For January 2024 in Pokémon GO 
A balanced all-round team
          

This month Sierra will once again start with the tricky Dark- and Ghost-type Sableye in Pokémon GO. There are three very varied options that Sierra can pick from to use second; Psychic- and Fairy-type Gardevoir, Steel- and Flying-type Skarmory, or Generation 1 Poison-type Muk.

Once you have passed Sierra&#39;s first two Pokémon she will again pick from three more for her final choice, all of which are tough to take down. This will be either Dark- and Fire-type Houndoom, Water- and Flying-type Gyarados, or the most recent addition to her squad, Grass- and Poison-type Victreebel.

 Best Pokémon GO Counters For Sierra in January 2024 
Using super-effective types vital for victory
          

Sierra&#39;s line-up in Pokémon GO this January can be tough for Trainers to take down, and due to the variety in her line-up, it is impossible to be super-effective against all her options.




                  Pokémon GO: Every Pokémon You Can&#39;t Trade (&amp; Why)   Pokémon GO allows players to trade Pokémon, which effectively transfers them to others. Pokémon GO does not allow players to trade back, though.   

Regardless of who Sierra chooses second and third, she will always start with Sableye. Only Fairy-types are strong against it, so using one such as Togekiss will give you a big advantage.  Using a strong Electric type such as Magnezone, can take care of Skarmory and Gyarados, but this can be swapped for a Ground-type Pokémon, depending on if Sierra uses Muk. Due to its dual typing, Magnezone can also be set up with attacks that are super-effective against Gardevoir.

For a final choice Rock- and Dark-type Tyranitar is a great option, it is super-effective against Houndoom and Gyarados, as well as being too strong for some of the Leader&#39;s other possibilities. Sierras&#39; line-up in January is varied and can cause Trainers problems, but she can be defeated using the right counters in Pokémon GO.
