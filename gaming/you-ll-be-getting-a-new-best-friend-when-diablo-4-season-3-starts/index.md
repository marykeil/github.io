## Literature Review

Diablo 4’s Season of the Construct finally adds a pet to the game, with a steampunk-style robot spider Seneschal Companion, and yes, you can pet it.




The next Season of Diablo 4 is starting soon and is finally introducing pets to the game, in a way. The Season of the Construct will call upon the Traveler to journey beneath the desert sand in Kehjistan, an area from which nothing good ever comes. Hidden behind traps and dangerous monstrosities are impressive rewards as the legacy of Zoltun Kulle&#39;s evil genius is discovered deep within the new dungeons called Vaults.




Season of the Construct is Diablo 4&#39;s third season beginning on January 23 at 10 AM PST, adding a limited-time storyline to the game with unique new game mechanics that take on a more robotic approach this time. Previously, developers tweaked things so that players who have completed the main campaign of Diablo 4&#39;s base game will no longer have to repeat it each Season but can jump right into the new action with a new Seasonal Realm character. Season of the Construct brings the story of Constructs, elemental forces, and several quality-of-life updates.

                  Could Diablo 4&#39;s Newest Season Save The Game From Total Disaster?   Diablo 4’s Season of the Construct will add more requested features, but time will tell if it is enough to bring back the players who have moved on.   


 Season Of The Construct&#39;s New Seneschal Companion Is The First Pet In Diablo 4 
The Steampunk Spider Cannot Die
          




While playing through the new Seasonal Questline of Diablo 4&#39;s Season of the Construct, players will get their own Seneschal Companion, who will tag along for the rest of the Season. This little steampunk friend will aid in battles and cannot die, and it will scale 1:1 with the player character in level, so at no point will it become out leveled. It has its own skill tree that is the main power quest in this Season, as players will be able to keep improving and modifying their little friend along the way.


 

The Seneschal Construct companion will happily tag along into the dangerous depths of the Vaults and more. As long as they are not actively in combat, characters can give the Seneschal friend all the love and pets they want, which is a positive direction for the game. Previously, Diablo 4 was criticized for having adorable dogs in town that would roll on their backs wanting attention, and yet the main character could do nothing but look on.




                  All Diablo 4 Classes (&amp; How They&#39;re Different From In Past Games)   All the classes in Diablo 4 came from previous Diablo installments, but their mechanics and abilities have been tweaked in several ways.   



 The Seneschal Companion Has Its Own Skill Tree 
Seneschal Construct Utilize Governing And Tuning Stones
         

While battling through the Vaults and other places in Sanctuary, special Governing and Tuning Stones will drop from enemies as loot. These magical Stones can be equipped by the Seneschal Construct in their skill tree to create various types of builds that will synergize with the main character&#39;s strengths. Seneschal Constructs can equip two Governing Stones and six Tuning Stones. Governing Stones will provide certain types of attacks for the Seneschal to do, and Tuning Stones augment those attacks to make them more powerful.




There are 12 Governing Stones and 27 Tuning Stones available to find in the game (via Blizzard News). Governing Stones will determine what type of ally the Seneschal Construct will be to the player. Here are the names and abilities for each of the Governing Stones in Diablo 4 Season of the Construct:

 Governing Stone  Ability   Autodefense  The Seneschal Construct activates an antimaterial field around itself, shooting down enemy projectiles. Can not shoot down Boss or Player projectiles.   Bushwhack  Quickly ambush, dealing damage to each target. May strike the same target multiple times.   Firefly  Deploy a small construct that lands on the target and explodes 3 times, dealing damage.   Focus Fire  The Seneschal Construct channels a ray of fire onto targets, dealing damage to each over time.   Gyrate  The Seneschal Construct whirls its legs around quickly, dealing damage to all surrounding enemies.   Impale  Perform a line attack on all enemies in front of the Seneschal Construct, dealing damage.   Lightning Bolt  Launch a bolt of Lightning at the target, dealing damage. Arcs to other targets dealing a portion of the original damage.   Protect  The Seneschal Construct materializes a protective Barrier on the player for a portion of their Maximum Life.   Reconstruct  The Seneschal Construct channels a reconstruction beam Healing the player for a portion of their Maximum Life over time.   Slash  Pummel enemies in front of the Seneschal Construct, dealing damage.   Tempest  Electrically charge an enemy, causing it to deal damage to themselves and additional enemies each second over time. If the enemy is killed, Tempest spreads to another enemy, gaining additional time and bonus damage. These bonuses are also applied if Tempest is reapplied to the same enemy.   Flash of Adrenaline  Administers a quick flash of adrenaline into the player, granting bonus damage for a duration.   






The 27 Tuning Stones in the Season of the Construct each provide extra benefits to the above skills. Any duplicates of the same Stones of either type can be fused together to grant experience and level up the Stones. As the Stones become higher level, they are stronger and allow the Seneschal Construct to do even more damage or healing.

                  Diablo 4 Review: Classic Dark Hack &#39;n &#39;Slash Done Right   Diablo 4 is a great addition to the series with a dark and gritty tone that is expertly balanced by the satisfaction of mowing down hordes of enemies.   



 Diablo 4&#39;s Seneschal Constructs Could Be A Precursor Of What&#39;s To Come 
Diablo 3&#39;s Pets Were A Fan-Favorite Mechanic
          

Diablo 3 and other games in the series have had collectible pets, although they were not as useful as the Seneschal Construct. Essentially, they only served to run around and gather gold, but as non-combat pets, they just looked cool. While they were a lot of fun to collect, they were not good in battle situations, like the Seneschal Construct. Whether this means future Diablo 4 pets will be non-combat or combat pets is unknown, but for now, the new pet is an impressive little friend.




                  Diablo 4 Devs Tease Pets Are Coming In A Future Update   One of the favorite features for many fans of Diablo 3 was collecting non-combat pets in the Seasonal content. Hopefully, Diablo 4 will add them soon.   

The Seneschal Construct will be acquired through the campaign of Season 3, Season of the Construct, so players should not be surprised when they do not immediately start the new Season with it by their side. This gives a chance for the mechanics of the companion to be explained both from a roleplay perspective and a practical one. Diablo 4&#39;s Season of the Construct will begin on January 23, at which time players can create new characters and start their journey to find their new steampunk friend.
