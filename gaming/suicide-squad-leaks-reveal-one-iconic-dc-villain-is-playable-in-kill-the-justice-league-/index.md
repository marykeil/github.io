## Literature Review

A new playable villain for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been revealed through data mining, and it&#39;s an Arkhamverse regular. 




A new playable villain for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been revealed through data mining. The next entry in Rocksteady and Warner Bros&#39; Arkhamverse will see players taking control of Amanda Waller&#39;s Task Force X, a team comprised of some of the DC Universe&#39;s rogues, with Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark, and Captain Boomerang taking on a brainwashed Justice League throughout the game&#39;s campaign.






Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#39;s story takes place five years after the events of Batman: Arkham Knight.




Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is confirmed to have live-service features, something that&#39;s a far cry from the previous Batman: Arkham titles and has already been controversial among the fanbase. While the game will have a battle pass and in-game purchases, Rocksteady has confirmed on the official Suicide Squad game website that this will be for cosmetics only, and will not impact gameplay. The game will receive free updates that include other playable characters, new levels, weapons, and more post-launch.

                  Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Release Date, Characters, &amp; Gameplay   After several delays, Suicide Squad: KTJL will return to the Arkhamverse as Task Force X takes on mind-controlled members of the Justice League.   





 Killer Croc May Be Playable In Suicide Squad: KTJL 
A Dataminer Has Revealed Killer Croc
          

Between Thursday, November 30, and Sunday, December 3, Rocksteady held a closed Alpha Tech Test for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. The details of this playtest were confidential, and those who were invited to participate signed a non-disclosure agreement with their gamertags watermarked across the entire game to deter streaming. Despite these precautions, the test has still resulted in several leaks, with people sharing footage of the game regardless of the NDA.

One major reveal came from a data miner, Miller Ross. Miller took to X to confirm that he did not sign the NDA nor did he take part in the Alpha test. Much as he did with his coverage of the Marvel&#39;s Avengers game, Miller has stated that he would not spoil late-game story details, but would be covering leaks about playable characters and more, and went on to tease Killer Croc as one of these in a series of emojis that clearly referred to the four confirmed playable characters and Waylon Jones&#39; reptilian villain.





 

                  Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Every Confirmed Character   Suicide Squad: KTJL is set to have an impressive roster of DC characters, with several characters also returning from Rocksteady&#39;s Arkhamverse.   



 Killer Croc Is Well-Established In The Arkhamverse 
The Villain Appeared In Rocksteady&#39;s First Batman Title
         

Killer Croc is already a well-established villain in the Arkhamverse, having appeared in several games. Waylon Jones appeared in a memorable sequence in 2009&#39;s Batman: Arkham Asylum, lurking in the depths of the titular institution. While one of the game&#39;s three post-credits scenes showed Jones&#39; reptilian hand emerging from the water to grab a container with the Titan formula inside, he didn&#39;t have a role in the sequel Batman: Arkham City.






Batman: Arkham Asylum&#39;s post-credits scene featured alternate versions with Scarecrow and Bane in Killer Croc&#39;s place. Bane returned in Batman: Arkham City, and Scarecrow was teased, with a full return as one of the main villains in Batman: Arkham Knight​​​​​​.




Killer Croc also had a brief jumpscare appearance in Batman: Arkham VR&#39;s hallucination scene, and appeared as one of the mercenaries seeking to collect a 50-million dollar bounty for killing Batman in WB Games Montréal&#39;s Arkhamverse prequel Batman: Arkham Origins. In Arkham Origins, Killer Croc appeared to be more humanoid than in Rocksteady&#39;s games, suggesting that his condition worsened over time, with him becoming more reptilian by the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum five years later.

This is even more evident by his appearance in Batman: Arkham Knight&#39;s Season of Infamy DLC, in which Jones appeared in an even more reptilian form during the Beneath the Surface storyline. Here, Jones kidnapped the prison airship, Iron Heights&#39; warden, and demanded a fix to this mutation, stating that the warden made him worse with his experimentation.




The warden revealed that the mutation is aggravated by trauma and is irreversible, which angered Killer Croc. After a boss battle ensued, Killer Croc was apprehended by Batman and Nightwing, which would then provide Waller with the access she needs to recruit him to Task Force X in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.



The members of Task Force X are incarcerated in Arkham Asylum at the start of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, rather than the Belle Reve super prison Waller recruits from in the comics and other media.




                  When Suicide Squad: KTJL Takes Place On The Batman: Arkham Timeline   Trailer dialogue and the appearance of some of the Arkhamverse&#39;s returning characters indicate when Suicide Squad: KTJL takes place on the timeline.   



 How Will Killer Croc Play In Suicide Squad: KTJL? 
Killer Croc Could Have Similar Gameplay To King Shark
With Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League taking place a further five years after the events of Batman: Arkham Knight, it&#39;s likely that Waylon Jones will be even more crocodile-like when he does appear. If so, Killer Croc could play like King Shark, who already fits more of a &#34;tank&#34; role within the team.




As Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a third-person shooter, its playable characters primarily use an array of guns to dispatch foes. They do blend this gunplay with some melee attacks, which are slightly more true to the characters&#39; comic book tactics, with Captain Boomerang&#39;s boomerang-based arsenal featured more through this.

King Shark uses a combination of close-up, bladed melee attacks, and heavy-duty weaponry such as a mini-gun, while using superpowered jumps and charges to traverse Metropolis. Considering Killer Croc&#39;s charging attack in Batman: Arkham Knight&#39;s boss battle and his sheer size, it&#39;s possible that he will use his claws in the place of King Shark&#39;s bladed weapons, and use heavier weaponry due to his size and strength.

While Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is set for a February 2, 2023 launch, players will likely have to wait a while longer to play as Killer Croc. With the character already appearing in the data for the game&#39;s Alpha test, however, it seems likely that he will be one of the first post-launch characters to be added to the game.
