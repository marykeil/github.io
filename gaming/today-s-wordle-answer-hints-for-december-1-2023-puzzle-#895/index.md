## Literature Review

December 1st’s Wordle solution is not too hard to solve if players don’t get carried away and use random words in their first three attempts.





Since there can be many possible answers, you will fare better with Wordle’s hard mode. When you discover the correct position of a few letters, it is imperative that you don’t get carried away and use random guesses. This mode prevents you from doing that, as it does not let you reuse confirmed letters in different spots. However, since many words have a similar spelling as the answer, it might be safer to use some hints.
