# Hogwarts Legacy How Professor Weasley Is Related To Ron


## SUMMARY 



  Professor Matilda Weasley is likely Ron Weasley&#39;s great-great-great-great aunt, based on their shared ancestry and the four-generation gap between them.   It is unlikely that Professor Weasley has any direct children, as she longed for a more stable lifestyle and is still unmarried during the events of Hogwarts Legacy.   While there is a moment in the game where players can choose whether to lie to Professor Weasley, there are no consequences for dodging the truth.

## Literature Review

Professor Weasley&#39;s relation to Ron in Hogwarts Legacy isn&#39;t made too clear, but doing some digging can provide a solid grasp of their connection.




One of the most prominent characters in Hogwarts Legacy is Professor Matilda Weasley, and Harry Potter fans will be quick to make the connection between her surname and Ron Weasley of the original series of books and films.The Deputy Headmistress and Transfiguration Professor, who honorably takes on the task of mentoring the player during the first few hours of the game, is a lovable character on her own, regardless of ties to future characters. Since she&#39;s the oldest name in the Weasley family tree, however, it&#39;s interesting to consider just how Professor Weasley in Hogwarts Legacy is related to Ron.




Matilda Weasley isn&#39;t the only member of the redheaded family that the player will run into during their term. After all, the Weasleys are not just one of the most iconic bloodlines in the Harry Potter franchise, but they&#39;re also one of the oldest, being deeply rooted in the wizarding world as a long-time pureblood family. Thus, it&#39;s unsurprising that the protagonist also runs into Garreth Weasley, another fifth-year in Hogwarts Legacy. However, since the Deputy Headmistress plays a pretty major role in the game&#39;s story (just like Harry&#39;s future best friend), her potential connection to Ron is the most fascinating.

 Ron &amp; Professor Weasley Are Four Generations Apart 
          




Although her specific relation to the Harry Potter character has not been explicitly confirmed, it&#39;s quite likely that Professor Weasley is Ron&#39;s great-great-great-great aunt. In the early 20th century, Ron&#39;s grandfather Septimus Weasley married Credella Black, the granddaughter of Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black, who himself is related to Sirius Black. This places the Headmaster approximately four generations before Ron&#39;s time, and since Professor Weasley appears to be around the same age, it&#39;s reasonable to assume she and Ron are also four generations apart.



 Professor Weasley Probably Didn&#39;t Have Children 
          

While Professor Weasley&#39;s relation to Ron can only be estimated, it&#39;s reasonable to assume that she isn&#39;t part of his direct bloodline. The Art and Making of Hogwarts Legacy book describes that Matilda was once married to a man named Paul, whom she met while working as a Curse-Breaker for the Ministry of Magic. However, she soon started to long for a more stable lifestyle, which eventually caused her and an uncompromising Paul to go their separate ways. Considering that she is still seemingly unmarried during the events of Hogwarts Legacy, it&#39;s unlikely that Matilda ever had any children in her time.






One major Hogwarts Legacy moment with Matilda Weasley makes players choose whether to lie to the professor or not, but there actually aren&#39;t consequences for dodging the truth.




The game does establish that Matilda Weasley is the aunt of Garreth and the sister to his father, who&#39;s only established to initial his name as G. Weasley. It&#39;s possible that he&#39;s also named Garreth, but the G could stand for anything, like the wizarding name Godric, or something more commonplace like George, a moniker that one of his relatives would eventually bear. Regardless, Garreth&#39;s connection to Ron isn&#39;t any clearer than Matilda&#39;s is, so it doesn&#39;t help answer more specific questions about the exact nature of the lineage.

The safest thing is to say that Professor Weasley is probably Ron&#39;s great-great-great-great aunt, although she could be just about any other sort of indirect relative in the end. She may be quite distantly related to the Harry Potter character, but she embodies his future spirit in her own unique way; just as Ron befriended a lost Harry and helped introduce him to wizarding world, so too does Professor Weasley with the player, showing them the ropes and providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. Regardless of her relation to Ron, it&#39;s clear that Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Professor Weasley is indeed a true Weasley at heart.
