## Literature Review

2024 kicks things off with a bang in some intense battles in Tekken 8 and plenty of action in Like A Dragon and Prince of Persia’s latest entries.




If people thought that 2024 would be a chance for them to catch up on their video game backlogs, they&#39;re happily mistaken. January 2024 is ready to fight with fierce combat in games like Tekken 8 and the action-filled adventures of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Traditionally, January is a bit slower for game releases, coming right after the shopping sprees and sales of the holiday season. Although the list of launches for January 2024 isn&#39;t as long as other months sometimes are, it is filled with plenty of quality entertainment to keep everyone occupied through the cold winter season.




January 2024&#39;s video game roster shows a lot of sequels launching to further their stories alongside the brand-new debuts. Momodora: Moonlit Farewell, Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes, and Turnip Boy Robs A Bank are all follow-ups that continue delving into their unique worlds established by earlier titles. These bring all new experiences for fans of the earlier games, while also serving to introduce newcomers to multiple new games to enjoy. Several entirely new games are also making their appearances this month, offering fresh adventures to begin the new year with.

 January 2024 Kicks The Year Off Right 
Several Fighting Games
          




Probably the most anticipated game coming this month is Tekken 8. One of the biggest fighting franchises, Tekken is known for being a more hardcore and competitive fighting experience than Street Fighter and typically has an extensive story. Tekken 8 will tell two stories this time around, one focusing on the continuing tale of father and son Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima, and the other on the creation of the new King of Iron First Tournament. The game will also have a new element of avatar customization as well as a jukebox to change the background music.

                  Street Fighter 6 Or Tekken 8: Which Fighting Game Is Right For You   With Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8 set to release just months apart, players may have to ask themselves which will be the right fighter for them.   

Another game for fans of the fighting game genre is Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes. Despite its complicated name, this action fighting game tells the story of a high school protagonist who joins forces with a mysterious girl to defeat the Paradox. It features 2D fighting in arena matches as the story is slowly revealed. This is a sequel to the 2013 game Under Night In-Birth and features a continuation of that story.

Another of the most anticipated games in January is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown which is the first new major game in the Prince of Persia series since 2010. It offers an action-adventure platforming experience set in a mythological Persian world, with the main character having access to Time Powers to heroically save the world from time-corrupted creatures. In addition to engrossing combat, there are hidden treasures, witty puzzles, and plenty of wonders in the beautifully detailed, yet corrupted, world for players to discover.



The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is also set to release this month and is available as a paid upgrade for owners of the PS4 version,

Some of the new games by indie devs releasing in January 2024 include some unique premises. Howl lets everyone experience playing as a deaf hero who is the only one capable of saving the land from a &#34;howling plague&#34; where anyone who hears the noise is transformed into a dangerous beast. Atlas Wept takes the bullet hell mechanic and uses it to tell a thought-provoking story about empathy, alongside friendly robot dogs.

The RPG is set primarily in Hawaii with some parts of Japan also featured. The game includes dynamic combat alongside the joys of exploring both Japan and Hawaii with a mix of quests and silly and fun activities that can be done at the player&#39;s pace, including a food delivery minigame.




As a start to the year, 2024 is setting the right tone, with beautiful, high-quality games full of intense combat and interesting stories. While January is generally a quiet month for the video game industry, having big releases of games like Tekken 8, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth ensures that this January will not be a calm one, for all the right reasons. These, in addition to the other games on the calendar, provide a promising start to the year and readily show that 2024 will be an exciting one in the world of video games.
