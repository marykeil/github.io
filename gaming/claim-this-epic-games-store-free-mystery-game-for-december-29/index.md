## Literature Review

The Epic Games Store is continuing its holiday celebration with yet another free game giveaway on December 29, this time a charming puzzler.




The Epic Games Store&#39;s holiday celebration is continuing with a giveaway of Snakebird Complete, the digital storefront&#39;s free mystery game for December 29. Snakebird Complete is available for free through the Epic Games Store until 11:00 AM ET on December 30, when it will be replaced by that day&#39;s free giveaway. It follows Cat Quest, which was the ninth game to be given away in a celebration that will continue through January 4, resulting in a total of 16 free games.




Epic typically gives away one free game a week, but really steps things up during the holidays, where the daily free games can be tracked on the Epic Games Store&#39;s Free Games page. There&#39;s effectively no caveat to downloading Snakebird Complete for free, except the title being inextricably linked to Epic&#39;s own storefront. Once the EGS free giveaways are claimed and downloaded, they&#39;re playable forever – or at least until some unforeseen circumstance renders them inaccessible.

 Snakebird Complete Is Free From Epic Games Store On December 29 
          

Snakebird Complete actually combines two games – the original Snakebird and Snakebird Primer, a game with the same mechanics but easier puzzles. Snakebird revolves around a handful of adorable creatures that (as the name would imply) are hybrids of a snake and a bird. With their length evoking some of the same mechanics of the classic Snake game, players must maneuver one or more snakebirds through a series of puzzles by carefully navigating obstacles, pushing the other snakebirds in the level, and keeping an eye out for dangerous falls. Sadly, the nine games preceding Snakebird Complete in this year&#39;s EGS daily giveaway can no longer be downloaded for free, but regardless, they were as follows:




 Date  Free EGS Game   December 20  DNF Duel   December 21  Melvor Idle   December 22  Art of Rally   December 23  Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition   December 24  Ghostwire: Tokyo   December 25  The Outer Worlds   December 26  Human Resource Machine   December 27  Cursed to Golf   December 28  Cat Quest   December 29  Snakebird Complete   



Although the mix of genres and scope has been nice, the offerings on Christmas Eve and Christmas likely drew the most attention. Ghostwire: Tokyo and The Outer Worlds are both fairly new titles from well-known, highly regarded development studios – fitting gifts to EGS users for the holiday. Snakebird is certainly unique no matter the company, and the puzzler is a fun brain-teaser to throw into a mix of RPGs, racing games, and other genres. While simple at first, Snakebird Complete&#39;s more than 120 levels will certainly pose a challenge to those trying to help the creatures find all the fruit the game has to offer.




Snakebird Complete will be availalbe for free via the Epic Games Store until December 30 at 11:00 AM ET, at which point it will return to its normal price as the next mystery giveaway is revealed. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the free games given away daily this year, so it&#39;s practically impossible to make any sort of educated guess on the matter. Regardless, Snakebird Complete is guaranteed to find its way to a new audience now, a potential boon to developer Noumenon Games, and will likely find some new dedicated fans.
