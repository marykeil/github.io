# New Call Of Duty Black Ops Can Fix The Series Worst Problem


## SUMMARY 



  Leaks suggest that the next Call of Duty game will be a Black Ops sequel set during the Gulf War, which could bring back the classic COD experience.   Releasing the next COD game on Microsoft&#39;s Game Pass would address the series&#39; biggest problems.   Microsoft&#39;s merger with Activision-Blizzard makes a Game Pass release for COD more likely, as Microsoft has shown a willingness to release big AAA titles on the platform, but an official announcement is still pending.

## Literature Review

New leaks suggest the next COD will be Black Ops 6, but it still needs to take on the biggest challenges facing the series. Here’s how it can do that.




New leaks suggest that the next game in the Call of Duty franchise will be another installment of Black Ops, which could be the kick in the pants the series needs. The annual franchise, which most recently saw the release of the lackluster Modern Warfare 3, is starting to stagnate. Concerns over its escalating price point, widening gaps caused by pay-to-win policies, increasingly enormous file sizes, and slowing trickle of new content have driven many players away from the COD franchise as a whole.




It may still be popular in some circles, but Call of Duty needs to offer something new, and fast, in order to remain relevant over the next few years. MW3 didn&#39;t quite scratch that itch, but the next game in the series has the potential to be. If the leaked information is correct, and if the next COD takes advantage of some major, recent developments in the gaming industry, it could be just the thing to revitalize the dying franchise.

 Leaks Say The Next COD Will Be Black Ops: Gulf War 
Treyarch May Be Developing Call Of Duty 2024
         

According to Windows Central, industry insiders have revealed that the next Call of Duty game will be a Black Ops sequel set during the Gulf War. This would mark a return to classic COD in many ways, trading drones and AI-guided missiles for tanks and helicopters, open-world zombies for old-school round-based survival modes.




This also coincides with earlier leaks that suggested 2024&#39;s COD release would incorporate remastered versions of classic Black Ops maps, like the skate park-themed Grind from Black Ops 2 and the Soviet nuclear facility WMD from the original Black Ops. If the leaks are to be believed, this would be the sixth game in the Black Ops subseries, and its development will be led by Treyarch.

This is all welcome news, and certainly a light at the end of the tunnel after the disappointment of MW3. But a new Black Ops would be even better if it tackled a much bigger series problem, one that&#39;s existed since long before the most recent entry.



 COD 2024 Needs To Be On Game Pass 
          

Whatever it&#39;ll look like, the next game in the COD series should be available on Microsoft&#39;s Game Pass. Available for a series of tiered monthly fees, Game Pass provides local and cloud gaming services to players on Xbox and PC, with a catalog of over 400 titles, and would be a perfect fit for Call of Duty.




This would solve two of the major problems with the Call of Duty series: the series&#39; increasing prices, and its downright unreasonably demanding file sizes. More and more games are charging $70 USD a pop, and for MW3, that doesn&#39;t even include the seasonal Battle Pass. And with the more complicated structure involved in downloading all of COD&#39;s different modes, players with smaller hard drives might have to uninstall all their other games to play MW3.

COD being on Game Pass would address both of these issues. For one thing, the next COD game would come a lot more cheaply if it was free to Game Pass subscribers. That&#39;d mean no risk for new players who aren&#39;t sure if they&#39;d enjoy the game, or for those who can&#39;t justify buying a new Call of Duty so soon after the last one. This way, they can hop on the game, try it out, and if they don&#39;t like it, uninstall at no personal loss. Then, if something grabs a player&#39;s interest later in the multiplayer season, they can always download it again.




Plus, it&#39;s easier for most to justify spending money on a Battle Pass for a game they didn&#39;t have to pay an additional fee for, especially when compared to a $70 title like MW3. At the very least, a special discount for Game Pass subscribers (which is already common practice), or a free Battle Pass would be a great incentive to bring more players to COD.

As for file sizes, Game Pass&#39; remote play option could help free up some hard drive space. Of course, it&#39;s not a perfect system, and is still in beta testing on many platforms. Slowdowns, wait times, and visual quality are more of a concern than they are when a game is running natively. But with a decent Internet connection, input lag is pretty much a thing of the past. It&#39;d still require a sacrifice in visual fidelity, but if the choice is between a slight dip in quality or turning one&#39;s PC into a devoted Call of Duty machine, many would choose the former.



 Microsoft&#39;s Activision-Blizzard Deal Makes COD On Game Pass Possible 
          




Thanks to Microsoft&#39;s recent merger with developer Activision-Blizzard, COD on Game Pass is looking more and more possible. Though many were worried about the deal giving Microsoft an unfair monopoly on the gaming industry, this could be one way in which it positively impacts consumers. Microsoft was finally able to go ahead with the acquisition as of October 13, 2023, after a long, international regulatory courts battle, making Activision, and by extension, Call of Duty, became a part of Microsoft.

That means a Game Pass release is certainly in the cards. A handful of big-name 2023 releases by developers under the Microsoft umbrella are already on Game Pass: Forza Motorsport and Starfield, developed by Turn 10 Studios and Bethesda, respectively, both dropped on Game Pass day one. It looks like Microsoft is embracing Game Pass, not as a place to dump older games that no longer sell or niche indies with limited appeal, but as a handy distribution platform for huge, AAA releases. COD&#39;s 2024 release could easily be the next game to follow suit.




But it may still be too early to tell. The next COD, whatever it is, hasn’t even been officially announced yet, so no one knows whether the Gulf War leaks are true, let alone whether it’ll be on Game Pass. While it may seem like a smart business decision that’d bring more players to the game, Microsoft could always decide that it’s still more profitable to keep Call of Duty far away from Game Pass.
