## Literature Review

Cynthia, the Drowned Lady, is seen in the fifth chapter in Alan Wake 2 during Inspector Saga&#39;s story as a dark spirit you must beat in a boss fight.





Those who played the original Alan Wake may remember Cynthia as a character from that game, who has now unfortunately succumbed to the dark forces that plague the land. There are two phases to this boss fight, one as the apparition lurks underwater and another when Cynthia becomes exposed. Make sure to stock up on ammo for powerful weapons like the Shotgun in Alan Wake 2 to prepare for this battle.

The first phase of the Cynthia boss fight in Alan Wake 2 occurs under the Overlap Nursing Home, within a flooded power facility whose power must be restored. As soon as you activate the central console in the first big room of the underground area, Cynthia will begin to attack. Whenever Saga stays in the water for too long, the ghost will attack after a short time to deal a massive amount of damage.



You can tell when Cynthia is about to attack from ripples in the water whenever Saga stands in submerged areas of the facility. You cannot attack Cynthia at this point, so letting the ghost land a hit only leads to you using a bunch of healing items.







Use the ledges around the area to avoid the ghost&#39;s assault from the water, slowly making your way toward the back of the room leading to a narrow tunnel next to a broken fence. Make sure to keep your flashlight on to see elevated spots above the water as you get deeper into the facility in Alan Wake 2. Head left until you reach a generator you must turn on, then return to the central console and activate the lights.

                  &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review   Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedyâ€™s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.    

Doing this starts the second phase, where Cynthia is vulnerable to attacks from any of Saga&#39;s weapons. The ghost will throw waves of water and spirits of Darkness that can damage you greatly in Alan Wake 2. Avoid both by moving around the area fast, while dealing as much damage to Cynthia quickly to prevent the boss from taking you down in a prolonged fight.




Once damaged enough, the ghost will charge you and try to attack physically with a swiping motion of their hands as a powerful melee move. Eventually, your attacks will beat Cynthia, The Drowned Lady in Alan Wake 2 if you keep up the pressure and don&#39;t run out of ammo.
