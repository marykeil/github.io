 How To Unlock Cheat Mode 
          

The first step to unlocking Cheat Mode is to enable cheats within Mount and Blade 2 settings as you are playing. This cannot be activated by the console itself, meaning you must manually set up this system. Thankfully, TaleWorlds has been clear about which console command cheats work, and some hotkey cheats that could be accessed faster than other exploits.

Go to your File Explorer and open the folder containing all the files labeled under &#34;Mount and Blade II Bannerlord.&#34; There should be four other folders inside the main game directory, but some players have reported seeing fewer as of this time of writing. If this happens, try to reinstall the game or verify the integrity of the game cache via Steam for Mount and Blade 2.




Select the &#34;config&#34; folder and find the document called &#34;engine_config,&#34; which can be opened using most word programs or other default text reading apps on a Windows computer. When explored, you should see a large list of options ready to change the properties of Mount and Blade 2. Search for the option named &#34;Cheat_mode = 0&#34; and replace the &#34;0&#34; with a &#34;1&#34; to activate cheats for the game. 



If you are having trouble opening the text document, you must alter it to enable cheats; consider using the Notepad application that is accessible by default on a Windows device.




The next time you boot up the game, your changes will likely carry over. However, you have to exit and save the config document before doing this, so be careful not to change anything else. Those looking to install mods in Mount and Blade 2 will have to use this process as well, making the steps to enable cheats a good stepping stone.

You will know if cheats are running if you can select any item in the game and add it to your supplies without any consequences.

Most of the options that are now available in Mount and Blade 2 are optional and presented through various menus/interfaces. The following hotkey cheats are all ones that have been tested on an ongoing character: 




  Hotkey   Cheat Effect    CTRL &#43; F4   While in combat, knocks out a single enemy.    CTRL &#43; ALT &#43; F4   While in combat, knocks out the entire enemy army at once.

 Console Command Cheats In Mount And Blade 2: Bannerlord 
          




Console commands in Mount and Blade 2 are also turned on with the cheat mode and used to modify specific aspects of the game. With the &#34;campaign&#34; command, single-player cheats are easily found in a drop-down menu that you can scroll through. Feel free to enter &#34;help&#34; into the console to bring up a larger list of cheats being offered.

  Console Command   Cheat Effect    Add Gold   campaign.add_gold_to_hero [Amount]    Add Focus Points   campaign.add_focus_points_to_hero [Amount]    Add Skill XP   campaign.add_skill_xp_to_hero [Skill Name] [Amount] [Hero Name]    Add Renown   campaign.add_renown_to_clan [Amount]    Add Influence   campaign.add_influence [Amount]    List all troop IDs   campaign.give_troops_help

As of this time of writing, all the above cheats have been tested on characters that were already part of an adventure or former save file in Mount and Blade 2. You may want to experiment with these exploits on a brand-new character to see if it negatively impacts your game&#39;s performance. The clarity of the development team with these codes makes it unlikely that any of these would fail unexpectedly.




An excellent way to prevent your adventure from becoming too disrupted by any alterations would be to have a backup save file just in case. Returning to the config document and changing the Cheat Mode value to &#34;0&#34; will turn off cheats and return your game to what it was. All the cheats in Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord could add a new layer of fun to your adventure, but it shouldn&#39;t come at the expense of your system.
