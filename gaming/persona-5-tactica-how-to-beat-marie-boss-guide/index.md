## Literature Review

Marie is the first boss that Joker and the party will encounter in Persona 5 Tactica, but don&#39;t let that fool you, her fight is anything but easy.





Considering that Marie is a heavy damage dealer, the main priority for the party won&#39;t be attacking her but avoiding her. Taking cover will be essential, as several of Marie&#39;s attacks can be lethal if you are not watching your health. However, as long as the party focuses on defensive tactics, then they should be able to bring her down in no time.

 How To Defeat Lady Marie (Phase 1) 
         

As stated, the boss fight will occur in three phases, with Lady Marie gaining new moves in each phase. To start the battle, Marie will begin tossing out her Bouquet, which will explode after a turn, so there are a couple of options for these. While it is ideal not to be within range of them when they blow, this is rather hard to accomplish due to the attack&#39;s wide AOE. Luckily, the party can also use melee attacks to knock them back toward Marie, which should be a priority whenever the chance arises.



Try to have Morgana as one of the player characters for this fight, as using Garula to knock the Bouquets back at Marie will give them a little more distance than using any party member&#39;s melee attack. Morgana&#39;s healing can also help if the party finds themselves in a pinch.







During this first phase, Lady Marie will also utilize the Collar of Matrimony move. This move allows her to drag one of the party members closer to her while dealing a good bit of damage. Unfortunately, this move is unavoidable, so the best thing to do is be prepared for it and keep up with healing so it doesn&#39;t down a party member. Also, remember that attempting Triple Threat Move is not recommended for Marie&#39;s boss fight. Finally, once she brings in her tank, Phase Two begins.



 How To Defeat Lady Marie (Phase 2) 
         

During Phase Two, Lady Marie will utilize the move Here Comes The Bride, which will indicate the route she and her large tank will travel across the arena in Persona 5 Tactica. Since the move indicates the path to the party, the best method for dealing damage here is to take advantage of that and knock the Bouquets into her designated path while avoiding it yourself.

Following that move, she will always use The Bloodstained Aisle move, when she will charge along that predesignated path in her tank, dealing heavy damage. Any Bouquets she encounters will explode, dealing damage to her, but remember to utilize one of your Personas in Persona 5 Tactica moves as well. Don&#39;t solely rely on the Bouquets to do all the work. Once her health has been depleted enough, Phase Three will begin.



 How To Defeat Lady Marie (Phase 3) 
         

The start of Phase Three will trigger one of the most annoying features of any boss fight: boss health regeneration. Lady Marie&#39;s newest move, Reception Attire, will heal her back to her full health. Fortunately, the goal is not to deplete it all over again. The party cannot damage Marie in this phase as she is invulnerable to taking damage. None of your party&#39;s unique skills will work, either. So it&#39;s best to take cover and wait for your queue from Toshiro.




After a cutscene, the party will have a new objective of luring Marie into a designated area so Toshiro can drop a Bell onto her tank. The first option is to use the party as bait, and the second is to use her Bouquets as a roadblock. Using the party as bait is probably not recommended, but for those willing to risk it, place all three party members in the area, and she will attack in a pattern, leaving her vulnerable to the bell.

The better option is to toss Bouquets back, but just outside the area on the opposite side of her, so she will stop when she reaches it, leaving her near the bell. Once the bell has been unleashed on Lady Marie, the fight will conclude, and Joker and the party will defeat the first Kingdom and Boss of Persona 5 Tactica.
