## Literature Review

Sargon can only increase their max health in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown by finding special artifacts called Soma Petals in different locations.





Once you reach the Citadel after beating General Uvishka in Prince of Persia: TLC, you will notice that many bosses and enemies will be able to tear through your lackluster starting health easily. You need to collect a total of four Soma Petals to give Sargon an extra life bar. While some of these Petals are given out as rewards, many are locked in hard-to-reach sections of your map until you acquire new abilities.






The first Soma Tree Petal you can find is actually sold by The Mage vendor at The Haven hub in the Lower City area for 500 Time Crystals.





 Where to Find Soma Petals in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown 
          

Soma Petals are either received as a reward for defeating a major boss or found in chests hidden throughout various zones. When you take down a boss related to the main story, such as Jahandar the Manticore in Prince of Persia: TLC, you get a special Soma Flower that already has four petals. This is a way the game automatically raises Sargon&#39;s health as you overcome important events in the story.

On the other hand, chests are found practically everywhere in the Citadel, but are sometimes locked in places that you may be unable to access. As Sargon gains Simurgh Feathers that give you time-altering skills, you can backtrack to old areas that were blocked off before. For example, the Simurgh Dash gives Sargon a dash in the air that lets you reach far away platforms in Prince of Persia: TLC.






Make sure to use Memory Shards to leave images of certain locations on your map, so that you can view them later and remember to return as you obtain new abilities.




Platforming challenges will sometimes yield a chest with a Soma Petal, but these require you to have a firm grasp on Sargon&#39;s mobility options. Remember to hold the jump button to leap further, and to tap the input quickly to hop through smaller spaces. Soma Petals are found in similar places as Xerxes Coins in Prince of Persia: TLC, and count toward the diamond treasure icon shown for a region on your map.



The Blessing Amulet in Prince of Persia: TLC can give Sargon a temporary health bar that cannot be recovered by the use of a Potion. This item can be upgraded at Kaheva&#39;s Forge to grant multiple health bars.




Those who increase Sargon&#39;s max health will be able to contend with stronger foes in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as they explore new areas that host dangerous enemies and bosses.
