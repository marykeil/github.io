## Literature Review

The holidays are upon us, and so are new games arriving just in time for gift-giving. Here are all of the new video games releasing in December 2023.




The entire year of 2023 has been a huge one for video games with an almost daily influx of incredible new games covering all genres and platforms for anyone to enjoy. December slows things down a little but still has some incredible titles launching, such as the heavily wishlisted survival horror game, The Day Before, arriving early in the month. Meanwhile, Disney Dreamlight Valley is coming out of early access for a full release, and the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC adds some anticipated new content.




As can be typical for the end of a year, December will have fewer big games, but still plenty to keep everyone occupied for the holidays. Several of the more family-friendly games will be available just in time for the holiday break, such as the nostalgic platformer, Raccoo Venture, and the cute RPG Born of Bread. That doesn&#39;t mean that those who are looking for a more intense experience will be left lacking, however, with experiences such as The Day Before&#39;s multiplayer survival horror and the fighting gameplay of Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising.

 December 2023 Is A Slower Month For Games 
DLCs, Sequels, And Some Big Names Are On The Release Schedule
          

Rounding out 2023 is a calendar with many DLCs and sequels attached to it. The Sims 4: For Rent expansion will be released on December 7 with the introduction of rental properties and unique ways to kill Sims off through the gross method of mold poisoning, which can continue to spread even after a Sim has passed away. Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s DLC The Indigo Disk will add new experiences to the pocket monster collecting game as the second and final part of the first DLC set that began with The Teal Mask in September. Even Fallout 76 is keeping its name alive with the unveiling of the second part of its Atlantic City expansion, America&#39;s Playground, which includes three new main quests in addition to side quests and more.




The list of all-new games to enjoy in December 2023 includes the beautiful Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora on December 7, where the main character has to discover what it means to be a Na&#39;vi and attempt to protect Pandora from the RDA. Decorating enthusiasts might enjoy how House Flipper 2 takes the renovation simulator a step further by helping a whole community in the virtual town. Alternatively, monster-wrangling adventures await the curious in Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince on December 1, featuring the cursed demon prince Psaro from DQ4 as the protagonist.

Every Video Game Coming Out In December 2023
         

The first half of December 2023 is fairly well stocked with game launches, but as the holidays approach and then the end of the year, things get fairly quiet. After the 15th, there are not many games that will be debuting, which could give some players a slight reprieve from the nonstop barrage of exciting amusements that have been happening for the past twelve months. Here is the full list of games that are currently expected to be released during December 2023:

 : Sorry, 2024 Isn&#39;t Going To Let You Catch Up On Your Video Game Backlog

2023 has truly been a year of consistent video game releases that leave no room for catching up with backlogs. December 2023 slows things down a bit, but there are still many big games that will easily occupy the hours over holiday breaks. The Day Before, Disney Dreamlight Valley, and even Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk each have some versions of multiplayer modes available for friends and family to connect from long distances. Even in this supposedly slower month for video game launches, every genre and platform is represented in ways that will provide something for everyone to discover and enjoy getting lost in as this year comes to a close.
