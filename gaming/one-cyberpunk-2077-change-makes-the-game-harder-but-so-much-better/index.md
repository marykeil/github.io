## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update has made one aspect of the game much harder but greatly improves its portrayal of Adam Smasher in the process.




Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update has included several new changes, and while it makes one aspect of the game much harder, it greatly improves its portrayal of one particular Cyberpunk character: Adam Smasher. From the moment he first appeared during the Arasaka heist, the company&#39;s massively cybernetically enhanced head of security, Adam Smasher, was built up to be an intimidating foe.






Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update launched on December 5, 2023, alongside the game&#39;s Ultimate Edition bundle.




[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077]When Adam Smasher appears during the Arasaka heist, Jackie describes the cyborg enforcer as a &#34;Night City legend&#34;, and a braindance sequence from the perspective of Evelyn Parker opens with him walking toward her to show his towering size, with V explaining that they could feel Evelyn&#39;s fear at that moment. From these early appearances, and the later reveal that Smasher was even responsible for the death of Johnny Silverhand it&#39;s clear that players would be engaging in combat against him at some point in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s story.

                  All Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 Changes, Updates, And Details   Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.1 update will add a lot of changes to the game, including a metro system, accessibility features, car chases, and much more.   





 Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 Update Fixes The Adam Smasher Boss Fight 
The Adam Smasher Boss Fight Used To Be Too Easy
          

Unfortunately, when the time came to fight Adam Smasher toward the end of the game, it was a somewhat underwhelming boss fight that could be beaten by most builds with minimal effort. For example, some players with a Netrunner build could stack easily acquired Quickhacks such as Short Circuit and Overheat to defeat the character within seconds, and those using particular weapons such as Comrade&#39;s Hammer could kill the character in one hit.

For the final battle in the game, and one that had been built up, many players had expressed their disappointment with the Adam Smasher boss fight. Fortunately, CD Projekt Red has taken notice of this and informed players that &#34;improved boss fights&#34; would be included in the 2.1 update, with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s quest director, Paweł Sasko singling out Adam Smasher in a live stream on the CD Projekt Red Twitch channel.




Normally when developers state that they&#39;ve made boss battles harder, it&#39;s a simple case of reducing the damage done to them or increasing their health bars to make the fight a longer, more grueling experience. However, CD Projekt Red seems to have completely overhauled the Adam Smasher boss battle to incorporate elements of the character seen in the anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners to make him a more formidable opponent​​​​​​.

                  Cyberpunk 2077’s Adam Smasher May Finally Live Up To His Reputation   Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s newest update will make the final boss fight with Adam Smasher much harder and closer to the reputation he gained in Edgerunners.   



 How Has Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Adam Smasher Changed? 
Adam Smasher Will Adapt To A Player&#39;s Build Type
         

The biggest change for the Adam Smasher boss fight is due to the change in the behavioral AI, as the character now counters players properly depending on their specific build and what perks V has equipped. For example, Adam Smasher now has ICE built in, which makes him more resistant to Quickhack stacks, and he will counter-hack V if the players try to use them.




Before the 2.1 update, Adam Smasher moved extremely slowly, making it easy to dash around him and attack him with melee weapons without getting hit. Those who have seen the character in Cyberpunk Edgerunners, however, know this is far from how he is depicted in that show. Along with several new attacks, Adam Smasher has his Sandevistan upgrade from the anime since the 2.1 update, which lets him slow down time and makes him appear to move at a lightning-fast speed to other players as he relentlessly pursues them with an onslaught of attacks.



A gun-heavy approach with Cyberware to slow down time - such as the Sandevistan - can be used alongside Phantom Liberty&#39;s &#34;Vulnerability Analytics&#34; Relic skill to deal significant damage to Adam Smasher.




While these upgrades have made the Adam Smasher fight finally feel like a challenging final battle for Cyberpunk 2077, it&#39;s worth noting that Smasher hasn&#39;t been made too overpowered in the process. Instead, CD Projekt Red&#39;s changes have encouraged players to adapt to Smasher&#39;s various changes in tactics and plan their approach accordingly, making for a more nuanced, satisfying boss battle worthy of the Night City legend.
