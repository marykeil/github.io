## Literature Review

Both the final boss encounter and ending of the Indigo Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are shocking. Here&#39;s everything that happens in detail.




The ending of the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is a shocking and pleasant one to witness as a player. The new expansion is the second part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack and is a direct sequel to the events that took place during the Teal Mask expansion. The ending itself is a direct culmination of everything that happened in Paldea, the land of Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy, all the way over in the Unova region. There are connections to special NPCs that appear throughout the story, thirst for power, and even revenge playing out during this second expansion.

Even though there is a new storyline that occurs in Blueberry Academy, ultimately players reencounter Carmine and Kieran, the siblings that went on the field trip to the land of Kitakami. Kieran was extremely disgruntled following the events of The Teal Mask and swore vengeance against the Trainer, promising that he would train and become stronger in order to beat them. Kieran shows up with a new look and is now aiding Professor Briar&#39;s search for the secrets behind the Terastal Phenomenon that mainly occurs in Paldea, but can also happen in Pokémon Indigo Disk’s Blueberry Academy due to a special device installed in the Terarium.

                  One New Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk DLC Was Hiding All Along   It seems like one of the new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk has been hiding in the base games, Scarlet and Violet, for over a year.   


 Kieran Captures Terapagos In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
          




Following a series of events that took place in Blueberry Academy, Trainers eventually make their way back to Area Zero’s Great Crater of Paldea along with Carmine. Both are going after Kieran and Professor Briar. Kieran, in his mission to become the ultimate Trainer, is intent on finding Paldea’s hidden treasure. Inside a secret cavern in Area Zero, Kieran locates a special crystal, which he collects. This gemstone contains Terapagos, a new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC. Once the Pokémon reveals itself in its regular form, Kieran throws a Master Ball at Terapagos, which results in them being captured as they make their way to the player.



As soon as Kieran pulls the gemstone free, before the creature shows itself, Professor Briar immediately identifies the crystal as Terapagos, the Pokémon of legend.

Right after catching Terapagos, Professor Briar will be eager to study the creature, and Kieran will want to check the powers of its newfound catch. This results in Kieran, the player’s rival, challenging them to a battle inside the cave in Area Zero. As soon as the major Indigo Disk DLC encounter begins, Terapagos will undergo a transformation with its Tera Shift Ability, which will see it switch into its Terastal Form. This makes the scrawny tortoise-like creature become a larger turtle-like Pokémon with a tail and a big shell that contains the symbols for all the Tera types in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

Following the gruesome battles against Terapagos, the Indigo Disk, Kieran is distraught, mentioning he believed that he could defeat the player with the hidden treasure of Area Zero. Professor Briar then intervenes, citing that the Terapagos’ “Terastal energy output is far too low.” She then instructs Kieran to Terastallize the Terastal Form of Terapagos so that it can reach its final form. Kieran follows the instructions promptly and uses his Tera Orb to further Terastallize Terapagos. The creature then shows its true form, known as the Stellar Form in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. During the transformation, a beam of energy is shot out from Terapagos and is heading toward Kieran.




                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Full Pokédex: Every Pokémon Number &amp; Type   Over 200 Pokémon compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all of them, listed in order.   

At this point, the player’s Legendary mascot jumps out of their Poké Ball to protect Kieran and absorb the blow of Tera energy. If the player’s game is Scarlet, the Pokémon to appear will be Koraidon. If it is Violet, then Miraidon will take the hit. This beam does not injure them, however. With Terapagos’ staggering transformation, the ground begins to crack, and Carmine desperately tells Kieran to return the Legendary creature to its Poké Ball. He tries but fails. As he points the Master Ball at Terapagos, the energy that would pull the Pokémon back hits a Tera shield, which deflects the energy back and breaks Kieran’s Master Ball.

This is when the second phase of the final boss encounter in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC commences. Along with Carmine, the Trainer faces Terapagos’ Stellar Form. Meanwhile, Kieran notices he put everyone and everything in danger with his uncontrolled ambition. The battle is tough and, throughout it, Carmine’s Sinistcha will get knocked out. If the Trainer Terastallizes their Pokémon to break Terapagos’ shield, the Legendary creature will absorb the Terastal energy, which makes the Trainer’s Pokémon revert to their regular form and sees that another shield is formed around Terapagos. During the battle, Terapagos also changes its own type constantly with the Terastal phenomenon, which makes its weaknesses oscillate.




Once Terapagos’ second shield goes up, Kieran is prompted into battle by his sister, but his lack of self-esteem impedes him for the time being. The player is then instructed to Terastallize once more to break Terapagos’ new shield. After they manage to destroy it, Terapagos absorbs Terastal energy once again. Carmine then tells Kieran to join the battle, at which point the Trainer can ask him to help. Crying, Kieran recovers his confidence and joins the player in the final boss battle against Terapagos in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. His first Pokémon is Hydrapple, a new addition to the Gen 9 titles.

                  How To Evolve Dipplin Into Hydrapple (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC)   In order to evolve Dipplin into the new Hydrapple in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you need to follow some steps.   

When Terapagos’ shield is broken the third time, it is unable to absorb more energy. After its HP is depleted, Terapagos’ Stellar Form breaks and the Legendary Pokémon will revert to its normal form. At this moment, Kieran incentivizes the player to catch Terapagos. Once the encounter has finished, Professor Briar apologizes for letting her obsession over the Terastal phenomenon put the three students in danger. After some apologies from Kieran in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC’s finale, the group leaves the secret cavern Area Zero and returns to Blueberry Academy.




In the main outside corridor that leads into the school, Kieran steps back and talks to the player. He mentions he wants to make amends with those he caused problems for and hopes he can get a fresh start with the Trainer. After that, Carmine calls both Kieran and the Trainer, and both rush happily toward her. This concludes the story of the Indigo Disk DLC. Unlike the Teal Mask expansion, the second part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero does not have a post-credits scene. After this, players are free to explore and play Pokémon Scarlet and Violet at their leisure.
