## Literature Review

January 12th’s Wordle answer contains multiple vowels, which could cause some players to lose their daily streak unless they use some relevant hints. 





Since there are three vowels, using Wordle’s hard mode is your best bet for solving today’s answer. This mode will not allow you to reuse the confirmed positions of the vowels in different spots, forcing you to use words with similar spellings. This mode can still be quite challenging, so if you require some hints to keep your streak going, you can use some below.

The January 12th Wordle answer is ROUTE.

When solving today’s Wordle answer, using words with at least two vowels is recommended. We followed this strategy and used SCORE, BOARD, and ROUSE. These words let us find out the correct positions of four letters. However, it got slightly difficult from here as there were many possible answers. Luckily, on our fifth attempt, we were able to solve today’s Wordle answer with ROUTE.
