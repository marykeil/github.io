## Literature Review

Exclusive: Avatar producer Jon Landau revealed to Screen Rant that the original concept for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora had an unusual focus.




The action-packed possibilities of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora might seem like the obvious path for the upcoming game to take, but it turns out that early concepts were substantially different. Developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, the open-world title takes on the world of Pandora from James Cameron&#39;s Avatar films, showing things from the perspective of a Na&#39;vi protagonist raised by the human colonizing force of the RDA. Exploring the planet is accompanied by the brand of action segments that Ubisoft is known for, with opportunities for infiltration and destruction that can be accomplished with Na&#39;vi and human weapons alike.




A focus on big high-octane spectacle isn&#39;t particularly surprising for Avatar, as the silver screen experiences are full of show-stopping action sequences. At the same time, the world of Pandora features a beautiful level of detail in flora and fauna to luxuriate in, which helps it truly stand apart in a crowded blockbuster scene. An exclusive Screen Rant interview with Jon Landau, producer of the Avatar films, revealed that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was originally conceived with a different balance of action in mind.


Jon Landau: Look, I think when we got into the game initially we were thinking of maybe a little bit less action. 


Screen Rant: Interesting. More story, less action.


Jon Landau: More cultural exploration without really a purpose. And that just didn&#39;t fit into the gaming model and we&#39;ve retained enough of that as we were talking about the cooking. What game has cooking?! Well, that goes back to what we started with, so that maintained, but we now have picked up the pace of our action and all that. But the player still has the opportunity to go, &#34;I don&#39;t want action in this moment, I just want to explore. I want to explore Pandora. I want the reward, the self-satisfaction of doing that.&#34; Like I said to someone earlier, I could fly my banshee 50 kilometers away and land in a place no one has ever been to and I&#39;m creating my own story. I&#39;m not following a story that someone else told me to follow. I&#39;m following my own story and creating that story and I&#39;m looking around this world and I don&#39;t know if someone&#39;s been here before. Oh, the RDA was here before. Oh, and how do I know that? Maybe where I landed, there are trees that are destroyed. Maybe they&#39;re not. Maybe there&#39;s a base that&#39;s been abandoned or maybe there&#39;s a base that I have to have a confrontation with. You don&#39;t know these things, but you create your own story.






 Action Isn&#39;t Everything In Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora 
          

Although it might have diverged from the AAA video game norm, a version of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora with less of an action focus could still have been an engaging game. If any environment from a blockbuster movie deserves an exploration-focused experience, it&#39;s probably Pandora, even if a lack of gunplay might have deterred some segments of the potential audience. Luckily, it sounds like the final game still maintains a healthy dose of the original idea, as Landau emphasizes the possibilities of putting off any given action mission to strike out with the sole purpose of discovery.

The banshee that Landau mentions is a big part of that sense of exploration in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora gameplay, making it easy to survey the world by air and alight in a new area without having to make a long trek. Navigation likewise emphasizes the value of discovery, with the option to abandon traditional map pointers to seek out objectives by finding landmarks. Landau&#39;s description of possible clues that the RDA could have already visited an area also points to the general use of environmental storytelling that can make paying attention to the details of Pandora feel rewarding.

Ubisoft is no stranger to creating vibrant settings, with the historical lands of the Assassin&#39;s Creed franchise standing as a particularly strong example of how much games can benefit from engaging locales. If Frontiers of Pandora can craft its world successfully, it could be easy to spend hours just getting lost and appreciating everything that the wilderness has to offer. It&#39;s interesting to think about what could have been in a game that kept the focus on this aspect, but Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is going to feature plenty of action as well.
