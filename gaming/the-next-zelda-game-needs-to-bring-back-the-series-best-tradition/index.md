# The Next Zelda Game Needs To Bring Back The Series Best Tradition


## SUMMARY 



  The next Legend of Zelda game should bring back the traditional mechanic of playing a musical instrument, which has been absent in recent titles.   Music is a key aspect of the Zelda franchise, with Link often having powerful instruments that allow him to perform magical songs.   Implementing motion controls for playing an instrument in the next Zelda game on the Switch could offer new and exciting possibilities for gameplay.

## Literature Review

A classic Legend of Zelda tradition has been absent in recent games, and as a result it would be perfect for it to be revived in the next title.




The next The Legend of Zelda title should revive a traditional mechanic that has gone ignored in recent games. Both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom can be considered a celebration of the Zelda franchise as a whole; they include hundreds of references to previous titles, and even revive and reinvent classic enemies to be scarier than ever before. Despite all this, however, some classic Zelda features are still missing from these games, with one particularly notable absence given the series’ history.




Across the Zelda series, certain game mechanics consistently emerge in patterns. For example, several games place Link in charge of a vehicle or other transportation. This includes Skyward Sword’s Loftwing, as well as the sailing mechanics of The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass. The gameplay of Tears of the Kingdom, with the many possibilities of the various Zonai Devices, is another variation on this theme, one with greater customization than ever before. But even so, it cannot be denied that another, even more iconic aspect of the franchise is nowhere to be seen.

 : TOTK’s Biggest Contributions To The Zelda Series Won’t Be Its Gameplay


 The Next Zelda Game Should Feature A Musical Instrument 
          

Music is one of the most enduring aspects of The Legend of Zelda, and many games give Link an instrument capable of playing magical songs. The titular Ocarina of Time is perhaps the most famous example of this; various songs played on it allow Link to call Epona, teleport to key locations, and even change the weather, among other uses. Similar mechanics appear in games prior to and after Ocarina of Time’s release and give Link a variety of powerful instruments to use in order to facilitate this. However, no such mechanic is a part of BOTW or TOTK, and the appeal of its return in the future is undeniable.




Both BOTW and TOTK give Link a range of connected powers through the Sheikah Slate and Rauru’s Arm, and it is easy to see a potential sequel to TOTK offering a similar spread of abilities through the use of a magical instrument. There are many ways to implement playing music in a new game, especially given the variety of already-established examples. Echoing older games like Ocarina of Time, Link could add to his repertoire of songs over time in order to significantly expand his capabilities; this would provide a refreshing change after BOTW and TOTK have provided most of his abilities at the beginning of the game.


 

It is also worth noting that gaming hardware could also have a significant impact on the use of an instrument. Although motion controls have somewhat faded from prominence in the Zelda franchise after Skyward Sword, the title does feature the ability to play the Goddess Harp with motion controls, something which carried over to the Nintendo Switch’s HD remaster of the game. Of course, the next Zelda game will probably be for Nintendo Switch 2, but there is currently nothing to suggest that an upgraded version of the Joy-Cons will not be a part of the console.






 The Switch Can Make Playing Music With Motion Controls Easy 
          

If motion controls are used for an instrument in the next Zelda game, there are many old and new possibilities for what that instrument could be. In addition to the harp already well demonstrated in Skyward Sword, Link could also make use of a set of Pan Pipes, similar to those he uses in Spirit Tracks. Alternatively, a conductor&#39;s baton like the titular Wind Waker presents a much broader concept, with the potential to create vastly more complex melodies than basic string or woodwind instruments can.

Given Hyrule’s level of technology, even with the advances presented by the Sheikah and Zonai, it seems unlikely that Link will ever use an electronic instrument. Nevertheless, something like an acoustic guitar is still one possibility for an entirely new instrument for the hero. A combination of held buttons and strumming motions could replicate the actions of playing chords, allowing people to both play pre-defined songs and invent their own melodies. Likewise, a simplified version of a violin could be used in a similar way, and is notably already known to exist in Hyrule; Violynne of TOTK’s Stable Trotters (or Stable Heroes) uses one.






Gage, the Lokomo Guardian of the Forest Realm in Spirit Tracks, uses a Cello, another member of the violin family of instruments.






 Music Is A Key Part Of The Classic Zelda Experience 
         

The relationship between The Legend of Zelda and music is extremely strong. In addition to Link using an instrument personally in many entries in the series, the soundtrack of many Zelda games is instantly recognizable. Moreover, the sound design of the franchise is masterful, and has only grown in quality as the series has progressed. Aside from the main theme, melodies like Epona’s Song have also become recurring motifs throughout the franchise since their introduction. And in the most recent entries, even more minimalistic music choices have contributed to the immersive atmosphere of Hyrule.




 : Why Breath Of The Wild&#39;s Minimal Music Was A Good Choice

Playing an instrument is an integral part of many Zelda games and a mechanic that has been missed in the latest games. Of course, both TOTK and BOTW have more than enough content and new features to minimize the impact of this absence, but it is still notable in retrospect. As such, the next The Legend of Zelda title poses a perfect opportunity to revive this tradition, especially with the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 offering many possibilities for interactive gameplay. It would be delightful to see Link playing an instrument once more, and the magical music created would undoubtedly go on to be another notable addition to the franchise.
