# One Reason Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Needs More DLC After Indigo Disk


## SUMMARY 



  There is a need for an additional DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that could make its story even better.   The Indigo Disk DLC concludes the story started in The Teal Mask, takes players on adventures away from Paldea, and explores the Terastal Phenomenon.   The DLC introduces tougher Pokémon battles for advanced players and features new and returning Pokémon.

## Literature Review

Even with the release of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk expansions, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players deserve at least one more DLC. Here’s why.




Pokémon Scarlet and Violet needs more DLC after The Indigo Disk for a very simple reason. The Indigo Disk is the second part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero expansion pack for the Generation 9 games and concludes the story initiated with The Teal Mask. While it is mostly set in Blueberry Academy, far away from the land of Kitakami, both DLCs are connected. They take players on adventures away from Paldea, yet still explore the Terastal Phenomenon, which is connected to Area Zero itself.




The Indigo Disk will also explore tougher Pokémon battles as a sort of endgame challenge for advanced players. There will be several new and returning Pokémon in The Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet, including two new Paradox creatures, as well as a Legendary directly related to the Terastal Phenomenon. In addition to that, there are rumors and leaks about the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC that indicate there may be new creatures that are connected to the story told in The Teal Mask. Nevertheless, there is a missing aspect in it that could be resolved with additional DLC for the Gen 9 games.

 Scarlet &amp; Violet Needs A DLC Focused Exclusively On Paradox Pokémon 
          

Although there will be the introduction of at least two new Paradox Pokémon – namely Raging Bolt and Iron Crown – with reports of Paradox versions of Entei and Terrakion to take the sum up to four, there is still a notable absence of more regular Paradox Pokémon. These Ancient and Future creatures are a big part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, especially toward the final portion of the story, yet they are quite limited in number. This could be fixed if there were a DLC focused on Paradox Pokémon.






Counting the Legendaries Koraidon and Miraidon, there are only eight Paradox creatures per version. The Indigo Disk expansion increases the number to nine Paradox creatures per game version.






 Paradox DLC For Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Could Deepen The Lore 
          

There is a lot that players discover at the end of the vanilla game, such as Project Tera, and how that ended up bringing Paradox Pokémon into Paldea nearly ten years prior to the events of Scarlet and Violet. With a DLC focused on it, players could perhaps have flashbacks to the creation of the time machine and maybe even catch new species of Paradox Pokémon – there could be time traveling through it to the past or the future depending on the game’s version, making for a much more complete tale.




Considering the commercial structure of Pokémon games over the years and their ordinary lifespans, it is unlikely that Scarlet and Violet will get any other DLCs after The Indigo Disk. Nevertheless, the game was a hit, even with all of its technical issues, so maybe there is a shift in the commercial strategy, with extra expansions on the way. If a new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC ever happens, Paradox Pokémon should be at the heart of it.
