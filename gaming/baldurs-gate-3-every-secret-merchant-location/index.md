## Literature Review

There are a lot of merchants in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but some exceptional merchants are harder to find due to certain quests and unmet requirements.





Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.




Each secret merchant falls into one of three categories; you either need to complete a special task to unlock their full list of wares, properly interact with them to unlock their wares or follow a certain story path to properly meet them. Some merchants appear in multiple acts but will only be listed in one act.

  


 All Secret Merchant Locations In Act 1 
         

There are five merchants (mostly Humans) that can be encountered during Act One of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, each with a bit of exciting loot to share with players who follow the right steps. The first on the list, Brem, offers a small selection of wares when you first encounter him at the Zhentarim Hideout. However, if you complete the quest Find The Missing Shipment, he will offer a wider range of weapons, including the Doom Axe and Giantbreaker.




Many players are familiar with Volo the Bard, as he offers to perform surgery to remove your parasite (taking your eye in the process). This requires rescuing Volo throughout Act One and eventually inviting him back to your camp. If you refuse his offer for a bit of amateur eye-scrambling, he will become one of the best merchants in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, offering some useful potions and scrolls.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 1   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is hiding boss encounters, powerful armor, weapons, cutscenes, and companions as long as the party knows where to look.    

Later, when you visit The Risen Road during Karlach&#39;s introductory quest, you can talk to Cyrel, one of Ander&#39;s companions and a supposed follower of Tyr. Cyrel offers a variety of items, including arrows, potions, and throwables. The key here is to speak to her before meeting Karlach and taking anyone&#39;s side. If you choose to attack Anders, you will have to kill her alongside her friends.




Lady Esther is an infamous NPC, obsessed with getting a Githyanki Egg in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 with less than stellar intentions. You can find her on the path to Rosymorn Monastery. She opens up for trade if you give her the desired Githyanki Egg, offering a few special armor pieces. However, if you don&#39;t want to give her the egg, you can trick her by giving her an Owlbear Egg collected earlier in the game.

Omeluum is one of the few Mind Flayers you will meet that doesn&#39;t want to kill you or convert you into a follower of the Absolute. It&#39;s a member of the Society of Brilliance and can be found at the Myconid Colony in the Underdark. Suppose you want to purchase high-quality jewelry from this friendly Mind Flayer. In that case, you will need to complete the quest Help Omeluum Investigate The Parasite, which rewards you with a special ring that limits the parasite&#39;s power.

  Name   Race   Location   Wares    Brem   Human   Zhentarim Hideout   Weapons    Volo   Human   Druid Grove/Camp   Scrolls/Potions    Cyrel   Human   The Risen Road   General    Lady Esther   Human   Rosymorn Monastery Trail   Armor    Omeluum   Mind Flayer   Underdark, Myconid Colony   Jewelry   








 All Secret Merchant Locations In Act 2 
          

There are fewer secret merchants in Act Two of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but they have a few useful wares to sell if you can help them. One of the most easily missed merchants in the game is a Deep Gnome named Barcus Wroot, whom you can first encounter in Act One.

You first find him tied to a windmill in Blighted Village as part of the Rescue The Gnome quest. When you prepare to untie him, you pull the &#34;Brake&#34; lever on the windmill and not the &#34;Release Brake&#34; lever, as that will fling him into the sky. Later, you will have to save him from Grymforge during the Save The Grymforge Gnomes quest. Succeed both times, and Barcus will become a camp follower with three items for sale: Acrobat Shoes, Gloves of the Automaton, and Ring of Geniality.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: 8 Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 2   There are so many hidden secrets, items, and quests tucked away in the Shadowlands of Act Two in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for players to discover.   

Later, as you journey through Moonrise Towers, you will meet Araj Oblodra, a Drow obsessed with blood. If you give Araj your blood in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, she will make a special potion based on your Race. Later in Act Three, as you explore the Lower City of Baldur&#39;s Gate, you will find Araj at her shop, where she offers an extended set of wares, including a few pieces of armor.

Further into Moonrise Towers is Lann Tarv the Bugbear, who offers a brief selection of items until you talk to Disciple Z&#39;rell about obtaining Ketheric&#39;s relic. By talking to the Half-Orc Warlock, she will have Lann Tarv show off his full inventory. He sells high-quality gear, including Gauntlets of Surging Accuracy and Dwarven Splintmail.

  Name   Race   Location   Wares    Barcus Wroot   Deep Gnome   Blighted Village/Grymforge/Camp   General    Araj Oblodra   Lolth-Sworn Drow   Moonrise Towers/Lower City   Potions/Armor    Lann Tarv   Bugbear   Moonrise Towers   Weapons/Armor   








 All Secret Merchant Locations In Act 3 
         

Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has some of the game&#39;s weirdest and most hidden merchants. Arguably, the weirdest is Skittle, a humble rat living in Heapside Prison, the jail of the Flaming Fists in the Lower City. If you have the spell Speak To Animals, you can talk to Skittle and get the Counting House Key and an Elixir of Universal Resistance. This potion can get you through ten rounds of combat with powerful protection against all damage.

Skittle isn&#39;t the only animal merchant in Act Three either. During the Missing Letters quest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you will encounter a Tressym named Tara in Rivington. If you have Gale in your party and Speak To Animals on hand, you can befriend Tara and complete the quest. Later, you can find Tara on two different rooftops in the Lower City, where you can get a special item in exchange for fish or magical items. You can get Hat of the Sharp Caster on the roof of the Devil&#39;s Fee and Slinging Shoes on the roof of Highberry&#39;s Home.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: 10 Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 3   The further players venture into Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the more secrets, quests and hidden areas within the city itself there are to discover.   

When you visit the Guildhall, make sure to talk to the bartender, a Bugbear named Severn. While seemingly unimportant, Severn can sell Drunken Cloth, a fun piece of Clothing that gives the wearer bonuses when Drunk. You can also visit Sticky Dondo, a Human child, at the Guildhall. He&#39;s easy to miss, but this small child can sell you a Shade-Slayer Cloak and a Supreme Elixir of Arcane Cultivation.

The final secret merchant in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 requires you to become an Unholy Assassin of Bhaal, a drawn-out process that requires you to sacrifice a companion or two to get this unique title. Once you&#39;ve been accepted at the Murder Tribunal, you can trade with Echo of Abazigal, a Ghost in the form of a Dragonborn, and get some unique Bhaalist armor and weapons.
