## Literature Review

Radar boosters act as lures and traps against many entities in Lethal Company. They can distract entities and blind them with a bright flash.





The radar booster is one of the most useful tools available to you due to the Version 45 flash update. The radar booster can flash and stun about twelve different creatures in the Lethal Company Bestiary, giving at least a few moments for you to attack or get away. This flash can stun some of the most dangerous creatures in the game, such as Jesters and Coil-Heads.





 Store Cost For Radar Booster 
          

As of Version 45 of Lethal Company, the radar booster costs 60c from The Company store accessed through the ship&#39;s terminal. This terminal, located on the right-hand side of the ship, allows access to some of the game&#39;s most important features, such as picking which Moon you want to visit.

                  Lethal Company: How to Disable Turrets   In Lethal Company players are always in danger and there are no safe places to hide, so they should disable dangers like turrets when possible.   

Since the allocation of credits is one of the biggest strategic points of Lethal Company, you&#39;ll need to make sure the radar booster is worth purchasing at your current stage of the game. Try to complete a couple of quotas and purchase immediate necessities like pro-flashlights and walkie-talkies before buying your first radar booster.






The radar booster requires one member of the team to stay in the ship to use, making it useless in a solo playthrough.






 Using The Radar Booster Passively &amp; Offensively 
          

The radar booster has three core mechanics to master, but to use any of them, you&#39;ll need one player monitoring events from inside the ship and one to set the radar booster up somewhere on the moon. Once the radar booster has been placed, the overseer can view the radar booster&#39;s monitor as though it were a player. Since each radar booster has its own name, you can head to the terminal and type &#34;view [name]&#34; and the radar booster&#39;s surroundings will appear onscreen.



If you want to focus on monitoring locations, you can place radar boosters in strategic areas like the entrance to the moon&#39;s main building to see whether it is safe to enter or not. It will also allow you to track entities outside the range of the exploring players.







If you type &#34;ping [name]&#34; into the terminal, the radar booster will say &#34;Hello&#34;. This call can be heard by both players and entities. The ping can lure away noise-sensitive entities by tricking it into viewing the radar booster as another player. The call is especially effective against Eyeless Dogs, who rely solely on sound to find their prey. The ping can also be used to help other players find landmarks such as the ship or building entrances in low-sight environments.

                  10 Lootable Lethal Company Scrap Items, Ranked By Usefulness   There are a ton of different scrap loot items found in the horror indie Lethal Company, but not all of the items are valuable or useful.    

When an entity comes close to the radar booster, type &#34;flash [name]&#34; into the terminal, and the radar booster will flash everyone nearby. This is a great way to stun entities, as most creatures wandering the moons are affected to some degree.

The flash can also blind players, so if you are running from an enemy, make sure not to look at the radar booster. The radar booster&#39;s flash can stun twelve of the entities found in Version 45 of Lethal Company:




 Entity  Stun Effects   Baboon Hawk  Briefly stunned   Bracken  Slight reaction to flash   Bunker Spider  Briefly stunned before increasing aggression   Coil-Head  Only stunned while in hunt mode   Eyeless Dog  Briefly stunned   Forest Keeper  Drops players when stunned   Hoarding Bug  Briefly stunned before increasing aggression   Hygrodere  Stunned   Jester  Slows down while in Hunt mode, stunned in both modes   Masked  Stunned with conversion process interrupted.   Snare Flea  Will detach from player&#39;s head and lay stunned, otherwise runs away   Thumper  Stunned   






By timing your flashes and pings, the radar booster becomes an effective weapon against many entities in Lethal Company.
