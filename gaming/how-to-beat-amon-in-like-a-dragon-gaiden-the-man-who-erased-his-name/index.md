## Literature Review

A boss named Amon is one of the hardest enemies you can try and beat in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name if you unlock their fight.





There are two Amon boss fights, one against Tetsu Amon and another against Gai Amon that are connected to the Coliseum&#39;s Team Hell Rumble mode. These fights see you and a group of recruited characters taking on waves of enemies in Bronze, Silver, Gold, and eventually Platinum matches. To reach Tetsu Amon, you must reach Platinum Rank for these battles and beat every fight in all four categories in Like a Dragon Gaiden.






To have every fight unlocked in the Coliseum, you first need to unlock the Arena by completing a story mission in Chapter 2. You also have to clear the Coliseum story mission in Chapter 4 that sees you take on the Four Kings of the Castle to have every fight category available.
