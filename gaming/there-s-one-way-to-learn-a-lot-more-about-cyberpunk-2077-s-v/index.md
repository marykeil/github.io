## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077’s V actually has a little more personality than the average RPG protagonist. New Datashards reveal more about their place in the world.




The protagonist V is kind of a blank slate in Cyberpunk 2077, but there are new ways to find out a little more about how they fit into the wider world of Night City. As per usual in open-world RPGs, V doesn’t have many traits by default. They barely even have a name, just a single initial that might appear to stand for any number of things. This is so that players can project whatever kind of personality they like onto the main character, deciding how to portray them through their Cyberpunk quest choices and in-combat playstyle.




But even from the jump, V actually has a little more personality than the average RPG protagonist. This is mainly because Cyberpunk players choose one of three Lifepaths when starting a new game: Streetkid, Corporate, or Nomad. Each of these changes the nature of the game&#39;s first story mission, and after that, provides a number of unique dialogue options that help to color in V&#39;s character. So, there are a few things that are canon about V no matter what. Some of these things, however, depend entirely on the player&#39;s actions.

                  10 Best Hidden Secret Events In Cyberpunk 2077   Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC are full of secret side missions and lore that is hidden away for players to stumble across while playing.   


 Hit Letters Reveal More About How Night City&#39;s Thugs See V 
         




As of Cyberpunk&#39;s patch 2.1, players may find hit letters that paint V in a whole new light. If V makes enemies of certain gangs, usually by killing some of their members or stealing some of their resources, the survivors will often come after them. Sometimes, they can find Datashards in these gang members&#39; inventories that describe their orders. These orders usually paint V as an irredeemable villain, a violent, selfish maniac who kills without conscience.

One Datashard in particular describes how the rank-and-file members of Maelstrom think of V; it can be read in the image gallery above. It recounts the Maelstrom&#39;s metaphorical loss of someone named Lucy. Based on the name of the Shard, &#34;Operation Scalpel,&#34; and the implication that Lucy is still alive, if no longer working for Maelstrom, this probably refers to Lucy Thackery. Thackery is a ripperdoc kidnapped and forced to work by members of Maelstrom at some point prior to the beginning of the game. In one of the earliest side quests, V can rescue her from captivity at Regina Jones&#39; insistence.




Thackery is a consummate professional who takes her Hippocratic Oath very seriously. Players must choose whether to rush her through healing a final patient, or allow her to take her time before showing her the door. She was obviously of great use to the Maelstrom, and not just in installing advanced Cyberware - she was probably responsible for keeping many of its sick and injured members alive. Her escape obviously represents a great loss to them, even if it&#39;s best for her in the long run.

                  You&#39;ll Probably Never See This New Hidden Location In Cyberpunk 2077   Cyberpunk 2077 is incredibly detailed, even in some places that players aren’t able to get to through normal means like this one, new to Update 2.1.   

And that&#39;s not even to mention all the Maelstrom members that V probably killed on the way in. Of course, it&#39;s possible that they took a pacifistic approach, but all the Maelstrom members in the clinic are heavily armed, and this job takes place early enough in the game that most players won&#39;t have an effective, long-range nonlethal weapon yet. While the Maelstrom is rarely up to anything good, V is responsible for the murder of many of its members. And the fact they looted this Datashard means they&#39;ve killed even more.




So, to the average Maelstrom member, even the most morally upstanding V is Night City&#39;s most wanted in their own, self-centered version of the Cyberpunk story. Maelstrom isn&#39;t necessarily scared of V, at least not at the point it put out a hit on them. But it does see them as a heartless adversary, whose appetite for destruction exceeds even the most deranged scavenger. That may be the exact opposite of how the player thinks of their take on V, but regardless of who has the moral high ground, V is guilty of what the Maelstrom accuses.



 What Else Is Canon About V? 
A Few Details About Cyberpunk&#39;s Protagonist Always Hold True
          

For the most part, V&#39;s backstory depends entirely on the Lifepath the player chooses at the beginning of the game. Choose Nomad, and V grew up outside Night City, a member of a former corporate family barred from all corporate employment. V eventually departed their Nomad family, becoming a smuggler in cahoots with Jackie Wells. Choose Streetkid, and V grew up within the city, often on the fringes of the law. They eventually tried to make ends meet in Atlanta, but this attempt soured. They returned, only to fall in with Jackie after they were caught together stealing a luxury car.




And as for Corpo V, they&#39;re the latest in a long line of corporate employees, doing covert ops for Arasaka until they lose their corporate status until their plans for an assassination attempt are discovered. Either way, after the intro, V and Jackie discover that they work well together, and spend the next several months making a minor name for themselves in Night City. The rest depends entirely on the choices players make throughout the game, especially which of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s many endings they get.

Another main job also hints at what &#34;V&#34; really stands for. During the main job &#34;Automatic Love,&#34; it&#39;s implied that if the player chose the feminine voice for V, their name is Valerie; if they chose the masculine one, their name is Vincent. At some point, they adopted V as an alias, which only makes sense given the extralegal activity all three Lifepaths require. V is extremely resistant to being called by their real name, even though they acknowledge it as such. That&#39;s a privilege reserved for those closest to them.




So, while there are a few things that are canon about V no matter what, for the most part, their role in the wider world depends entirely on player choice. The impact of those choices begins even before the game does; players pick their Lifepath before anything else. However, the new addition of accurate hit letters from an alternate perspective does a lot to place V in the wider world. It&#39;s a small detail that makes Cyberpunk 2077 feel infinitely more immersive.
