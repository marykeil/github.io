## Literature Review

Each of the four common rooms in the Hogwarts Castle are impressive, but in Hogwarts Legacy’s recreation of them, one of them feels more like home.




The overall design of the iconic castle in Hogwarts Legacy is beautifully crafted and gives players a sense of truly being a part of the Hogwarts experience. This is especially true for common rooms, with each of the four having its own design theme to set it apart and reflect the values of that respective House. Depending on where the player is sorted, they will essentially have that common room as their home away from home at Hogwarts. The Hogwarts Legacy common rooms are a place to meet up with other wizarding students, practice spells, and just relax and enjoy a cozy, home-like environment after a long day of school.
Each Hogwarts Legacy House common room is different from the others to reflect the values and color theme of each. Even the locations of the common rooms seem to carry forward some suppositions about the personalities of each House, with Slytherin being sent to the dungeons and Hufflepuff in the basement, while Gryffindor and Ravenclaw each have grand tower locations. The art designers and developers of Hogwarts Legacy tailored each common room design for its specific house, including the background music for each of those areas in the game. The variety in style between the four is distinct, but each offers a grand feel that one would naturally expect from Hogwarts Castle.

In Hogwarts Legacy, which house a player gets sorted into matters for more than just cosmetics, there are also unique quests available for each. 












 








 4  Slytherin Common Room 
Location: Bottom Of The Grand Staircase


The Slytherin House has a bad reputation, and unfortunately, its common room in Hogwarts Legacy does nothing to change it. Entering the Slytherin common room involves a fantastical bit of magic with a large serpent rising up to reveal the hidden door, but once inside, it&#39;s a dark and cold space. The skeletal remains of creatures decorating the space, combined with hard marble and lack of lighting don&#39;t distract one from the knowledge that they are in a dungeon, although the underwater view out the windows is a strikingly elegant touch in Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s rendition.
Slytherin&#39;s common room is still an interesting place to explore, and it might still be the favorite pick of some players. Even if the attraction of Slytherin is a bit more fringe than other options, the House has always had some edgy appeal, ad the common room does fit properly into this image. Players looking to brood, scheme, or mutter curses could do much worse than the Slytherin dungeon. Regarding its overall allure, however, the Slytherin common room just can&#39;t quite compete with what the other Houses have to offer.





 3  Gryffindor Common Room 
Location: Faculty Tower


Gryffindor&#39;s House common room is well known to fans of the Harry Potter book series or movies. Players sorted into this Hogwarts Legacy House will probably come with an idea already in mind of what it will look like, which developers did their best to recreate. Warmth accompanies a feeling of courage and bravery in this Hogwarts Legacy common room with its scarlet and gold colors, medieval architecture, moving paintings, and dignified fireplace. It&#39;s easy to step through these doors and immediately imagine a Gryffindor celebration of a feat of bravery or a Quidditch win.
Gryffindor&#39;s familiarity is slightly double-edged, as this particular common room also has a less distinct flavor than the others. Many players will be happy to embrace this aspect and settle in comfortably to this well-loved environment, but others might look for something a little more unique. The room is a work of art, and the perfect choice for Gryffindor diehards or lovers of the color red, but the other common rooms are equally, if not more, impressive.





 2  Ravenclaw Common Room 
Location: Grand Staircase Fourth Floor


Similar to Gryffindor, Ravenclaw&#39;s common room is located in one of the towers of Hogwarts Castle. The general air about this Hogwarts Legacy space is that of intellectualism with the entire area being decorated with constellations, books, and chairs that seem to call out for one to sit and ponder the philosophies of the world. Everything in the Ravenclaw common room is generally focused on this ideal, with little clutter of a nature that could distract from studies.
Ravenclaw might have the most visually striking of all the House common rooms, although that doesn&#39;t necessarily make it the very best overall. The Ravenclaw common room is truly awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, reminding one of a library or even the White House in places. The windows offering a panoramic view of the Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s sizable map fit Ravenclaw&#39;s emphasis on wisdom and learning quite well.





 1  Hufflepuff Common Room 
Location: Near The Kitchen


Although some people consider Hufflepuff the worst house in Hogwarts Legacy, its common room is the best of the bunch. The Hufflepuff common room is located in the basement, but its comfy feel will make players want to join the House. This area feels warm and cozy with its round doors, wood touches, and a vast array of plants. Hufflepuff students tend to lean towards having strength in any herbology-related subject, an aspect directly reflected in the design of this environment.
Like with Ravenclaw, fans have not had many opportunities to see the Hufflepuff common room before Hogwarts Legacy, making the chance to finally explore it a delight. Warm lighting, comfortable-looking sofas, rugs, and flowing accents make it feel like a place to curl up with a patchwork quilt and a good book. It&#39;s all too easy to imagine the scents of cooking that must waft into the Hufflepuff common room from the nearby Hogwarts kitchens. The other Hogwarts Legacy common rooms have their own strengths to offer, but none are as comfortable or charming as the delightful atmosphere of Hufflepuff&#39;s abode.
Each of the individual House common rooms provides an insightful reflection on many of the values that the students sorted into those Houses either hold or aspire to. Seeing all the ways Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s designers and developers interpreted and created these areas with such attention to even the smallest detail is impressive. While those playing on Nintendo Switch might face more loading screens when transitioning from common rooms to the rest of the school, there&#39;s no denying that the developers have crafted magical and lore-accurate areas for each House.
Considering students&#39; different backgrounds and walks of life, it would be hard to sort them all into only four categories, yet HogwartsLegacy has made each of these Houses and common rooms places that nearly anyone would enjoy being able to call them their temporary home away from home.
