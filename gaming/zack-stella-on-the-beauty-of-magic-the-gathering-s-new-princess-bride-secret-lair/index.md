## Literature Review

The senior art director behind the latest Magic: The Gathering x Secret Lair drop on translating iconic Princess Bride characters into cards.





This year has featured a lot of delightful collaborations between the tabletop game and different IPs, from a special Doctor Who Magic: The Gathering set to a Jurassic Park release. This latest collection faced a unique challenge, balancing its influences from both the written word and iconic film to create something that fans of both mediums can enjoy. Each card includes unique art and quotes from The Princess Bride, with the collection slated to release November 19.

Screen Rant: What was your role in the drop?


Lead art director.


When this collaboration first began, what things were most important to you regarding The Princess Bride that you really wanted to come through in these cards?


As an &#39;80s child, I grew up loving both the film and (nearly even more so) the The Princess Bride novel. It&#39;s filled with extremely emotive characters and immense heart, and the film in particular is incredibly quotable. We wanted to really nail the gestures and expressions of the characters in their card art and try and harness those feelings of emotional connection and nostalgia, but in a way that felt fresh and current. I wanted this set to feel like catching up with old friends again. The visual goal was a look that married the sweeping romanticism and storybook elements at the core of The Princess Bride (I framed the visual target as “Waterhouse/Maxfield Parish paintings meet 80’s novel cover”.) It had to feel lush, romantic, and above all, charming.





With both a book and movie to pull from, what was that balancing act like? Did you lean more on one than the other for inspiration?


This particular set of cards relied on the film likenesses, but we would have been doing the cards a disservice if we didn&#39;t at least nod at the novels in some way, which is where the inspiration for the stylistic art nouveau-esque framing elements came in. After all, The Princess Bride is both a book itself, and in the case of both the film and the novel, it&#39;s presented as a story within a story!


These cards do a beautiful job of capturing the storybook feel, and some are even a bit reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts. How did you work towards attaining that aesthetic?


The team and I bounced around a few ideas, but I found myself fixating on the original novel cover, which has this great graphic layout with Princess Buttercup depicted in front of a circular window framing element. I thought: what if we took the graphic element of that window one step further into art nouveau style borders? It visually checked off so many of the boxes - it evoked illuminated manuscripts that lent a storybook quality, felt medieval fantasy, and at the same time felt flourish-y and romantic.
The graphic picture windows let us have our cake and eat it too in a way, because the approach allowed for amazing painted portraits of the main cast of characters at the same time as maximizing the number of references and depictions. Here, the characters were not constrained to appearing once on their own cards, but they could show up multiple times all through the drop. Like sequential comic panels, we could show different story moments, emotional shifts, or visual links between the &#34;main c
haracter&#34; on each card and the rest of the cast showing up in the background windows.





                  10 Coolest Magic: The Gathering Cards From The Jurassic World Crossover   Magic: The Gathering’s Lost Caverns Of Ixalan has 26 cards that crossover with Jurassic World’s 30th anniversary. Here are the best revealed so far.   

Do you have a favorite card design from the bunch?


I think all the artists absolutely nailed the assignment for this set of cards, but here are some of my favorite details:
-Sam Hogg&#39;s use of the shrieking eel to form the nouveau border on &#34;Silence&#34;. And the Vizzini getting progressively angrier in each window is just perfect.
-The symbolic blackened roses on Kate Burmak&#39;s Iñigo card.
-The kangaroo, war map, and philosophers on Dmitry Burmak&#39;s Vizzini.
-And the secret card is just *chef&#39;s kiss* :)


Is there a particular card or character that was especially hard to capture visually? Any that went through many ideations before landing on the perfect look?


It only takes mere micrometers to turn one face into another, but I have to say, this was one of the easiest projects I&#39;ve ever been on in terms of how fast the artists got the likenesses.





What do you think fans of The Princess Bride will appreciate the most about this set


I hope the care, attention to detail, and love we all had for this set and The Princess Bride comes through. I think it does. As an AD I couldn&#39;t be happier with how it turned out.




The Magic: The Gathering Princess Bride set is available now until November 19.
