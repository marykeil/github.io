## Literature Review

To find Rykard Lord of Blasphemy in Elden Ring, Tarnished adventurers must explore the exterior of Volcano Manor to find a secret portal to the boss.





To get to Volcano Manor in Elden Ring, you need to head to Mt. Glemir in the Altus Plateau. You can either climb up the perilous mountain or complete one of Rya&#39;s requests in Liurnia. Upon reaching the Manor, you can speak with Tanith, who will be at the Manor&#39;s Site of Grace. This will start a series of contracts, which you must complete first. Once all the contracts are completed, Tanith will give you access to Rykard&#39;s lair.




                  Elden Ring DLC Could Take Players Into Miquella&#39;s Dreams   Elden Ring explored the dream of Godwyn the Golden, but there is more cut content regarding Miquella, the sleeping demigod that could become DLC.   


 How To Locate Rykard in Elden Ring 
          

The other way to get access to Rykard&#39;s lair in Elden Ring is to enter the room on the right in the manor&#39;s side corridor. You can use the key given to you earlier by Tanith. Upon entering the room, you will notice an Illusory Wall, which hides a passage that leads to the inner exterior of the Manor. Following along the main pathway should lead you to the Temple of Eiglay, where you will face a Godskin Noble mini-boss. This temple sits across in the southeast from the Prison Town Church. If you need some help defeating the Godskin Noble at the Temple of Eiglay, check out the video from GrubMagnet Gaming on YouTube below:





 

After defeating the noble, exit out the second floor and cross the magma river to reach a portal on the backside of the manor, which teleports you to the Audience Pathway, the area of rest right before you get to Rykard in Elden Ring. You can reach to the portal by running straight across the river of lava while gulping down HP Flasks or take the heavily guarded route through the overpass.



 How To Beat Rykard in Elden Ring 
          

Once you reach Rykard&#39;s fight, he will be dormant in the room&#39;s center. On the way, you will notice a lootable Great Spear held by a corpse. Collect the &#34;Serpent Hunter&#34; spear as it can used against the God-Devouring Serpent. This spear also has several special attacks that are highly effective against Rykard.




Furthermore, the Serpent-Hunter has no stat requirements, meaning any build can use the Great Spear to defeat the boss. Nevertheless, some players, such as spellcasters, might not realize this when they enter the fight. Check out the video from Shirrako below to see how to dodge Rykard&#39;s attacks: 


 

Equip the Serpent-Hunter and continuously use the staggering, slamming-stab ability on the giant serpent. Make sure to time the attacks properly to not let Rykard have a chance to retaliate. When fighting the Lord of Blasphemy with an ally wielding the Serpent-Hunter, the Elden Ring boss fight becomes even easier. Once the second phase begins, continue the exact attack as before to defeat Rykard.



This fight previously had a rare glitch which would prevent Rykard from dying after reaching 0% health. If this happens (demonstrated below in a video from Filthy &amp; Free Publishing) simply restart the fight and try again.
