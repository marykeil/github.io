## Literature Review

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has a lot of highly effective weapons, especially when it comes to the impressive lineup of Exquisite bows.




Na&#39;vi bows are an exciting part of the weapon catalogue in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and none more so than Exquisite bows. Frontiers of Pandora weapons are divided into three rarities, with the Fine and Superior options both offering options that are less relevant for the endgame than the top-billed Exquisite products. These can be acquired directly or through crafting recipes, with both options made accessible by talking to Na&#39;vi NPCs or completing quests.
The quality of any individual bow in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora comes both from its basic damage output and various perks that it might have, which can take on special relevance depending on playstyle. Some bows help make follow-up attacks more powerful, while others are perfect for stealth options. Although some perks are innate to specific designs, materials used can sometimes affect abilities along with the basic stats. There are strong Exquisite choices across all categories – longbows, shortbows, and heavy bows – but some are better than others.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.












 








 10  Kame&#39;tire Poison Longbow 
Poisoned Arrows


 







The Kame&#39;tire Poison Longbow isn&#39;t the most interesting Exquisite bow in its default form, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a worthwhile option to increase combat strength in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Any weapon with the ability to deal poison damage tends to come in handy, as a single well-placed shot could take down multiple mechs or soldiers over a bit of time. This isn&#39;t necessarily the bow to have out in the midst of the fray, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s never a reason to equip it in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.





 9  Black Wind Heavy Bow 
Flame Arrows, Affliction Effect
        

The Black Wind Heavy Bow isn&#39;t the single most effective Exquisite heavy bow for general use, but it&#39;s perfect for anyone who&#39;s trying to set up combos in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The Affliction Effect deals an extra 35% damage to any target with a status effect, a substantial advantage that can&#39;t be ignored. Whether lighting them up with the alternate fire flame arrows or relying on another weapon or environmental tool to apply the status effect, swapping over to this is a great way to capitalize.

Although it is a bit of a perplexing process, learning how to craft your own gear in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is well worth the time and effort.








 8  So&#39;lek&#39;s Furtive Longbow 
Grenade Arrows, Payback
        

So&#39;lek&#39;s Furtive Longbow is one of the more interesting Exquisite bows in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in terms of general playstyle. The Payback ability rewards ducking in and out of cover, as breaking line of sight from hostile enemies will grant a temporary bonus to damage. This isn&#39;t a good choice for use in wide-open plains, but inside RDA bases, there&#39;s usually plenty of cover to go around, making So&#39;lek&#39;s Furtive Longbow an interesting choice.





 7  So&#39;lek&#39;s Lightning Shortbow 
Storm Arrows, Weakspot Dash
        

So&#39;lek&#39;s Lightning Shortbow is an excellent choice for quickfire damage, with a 126 damage stat that&#39;s exceptionally impressive for an Exquisite bow with shortbow fire speed. Weakspot Dash briefly increases move speed after hitting weakspots, adding a little extra mobility on the battlefield, although that isn&#39;t necessarily one of the most game-changing perks. Storm arrows make for a solid alternate fire option, especially if a mech is on the protagonist&#39;s tail.





 6  Blazing Heavy Bow 
Flame Arrows
        

The Blazing Heavy Bow is the perfect way to light up an RDA site, outdoing other flaming weapons in the game in sheer power. Trading in a healthy chunk of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora clan favor to Heykinak at the Kame&#39;tire&#39;s main encampment can earn a basic but highly effective version of the bow. With 162 damage and flame arrows for alternate fire, this is a fast path to instilling fear into the hearts of enemies, even if the rate of fire won&#39;t be exceptional.





 5  So&#39;lek&#39;s Survivor Heavy Bow 
Grenade Arrows, Revitalizing
        

It&#39;s best to steer clear of the blast radius of Solek&#39;s Survivor Heavy Bow, as the grenade arrows that this Exquisite bow can fire show no mercy. With the highest-quality ingredients, this heavy bow can max out at 222 damage, although it&#39;s more likely to be in the 100s with most choices. The Revitalizing ability restores health after killing enemies, making it easy to take a little damage in the heat of battle and keep picking off opponents.





 4  So&#39;lek&#39;s Merciless Longbow 
Grenade Arrows, Efficient Tactics


 







So&#39;lek has a fair share of weapons that are among the best that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has to offer, and So&#39;lek&#39;s Merciless Longbow is no exception. Efficient Tactics and Steady Aim both serve to keep the momentum going in battle, and a grenade arrow for alternate fire can do major damage whenever it&#39;s necessary. The design is somewhat haphazard, but that isn&#39;t a major concern when the bow is this effective.





 3  So&#39;lek&#39;s Lightning Heavy Bow 
Storm Arrows, Revitalizing
        

So&#39;lek&#39;s Lightning Heavy Bow is an excellent Exquisite choice for high damage in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, featuring a damage stat of 189 when bought directly from So&#39;lek. Like the Survivor Heavy Bow, the Revitalizing feature helps restore health in the middle of combat. In this case, the alternate fire uses storm arrows, which can be perfect for immobilizing mechs before taking them down in melee.





 2  Energizing Longbow 
Flame Arrows, Energizing
        

Getting the Energizing Longbow in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora isn&#39;t easy. The Memories of the Maker Frontiers of Pandora skill tree has to first be completed, which will then unlock an Apex Challenge called &#34;The Bow Master,&#34; which grants designs for the Energizing Longbow. Rather than requiring one Exquisite ingredient, the Energizing Longbow needs three – a Dawnsheen Branch, Shaded Waterweed Bast, and Hammerhead Horn. The Energizing ability restores energy throughout combat, helping to keep healing resources at hand.

Tarysu Saplings can be found for Skill Points in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, but every location of these plants are across a massive open-world.








 1  Heykinak&#39;s Relentless Shortbow 
Flame Arrows, Fusillade


 







Shortbows are the best way to deal quick damage in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, especially when that damage amounts to a whopping 120. Heykinak&#39;s Relentless Shortbow gets even better thanks to the Fusillade ability that stacks extra damage against the same target, making it highly effective for unloading into enemy mechs. With flame arrows for alternate fire and a 10% boost to stealth damage, it&#39;s hard to think of how much more an Exquisite bow could possibly do in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
