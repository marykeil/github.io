## Literature Review

A multiclassed Barbarian is more than just a damage dealer in Baldur’s Gate 3. They move quickly and are even harder to kill.





This Barbarian build can be used on any character. Karlach is the best option, as she already begins in the Barbarian class. But you can also make the main character a second Barbarian or speak to Withers to change classes in BG3.




  


 How To Multiclass a Barbarian in Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

One of the biggest hindrances in Dungeons in Dragons is the “Action Economy” concept. You are typically only allowed one main action, one movement, and a bonus action. Barbarian, on its own, usually follows these rules. But, there are two main classes that can expand the action economy budget: Fighter and Rogue, the latter of which is excellent for a solo build in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Fighter allows you to use a full set of actions once per long rest, while Rogue gets many bonus actions.

                  5 Best Multiclass Combinations In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you can create different multiclass builds to best unlock strong hybrid combinations with diverse spellsets and abilities.   




How To Build a Barbarian Multiclass
You still want to fundamentally begin character creation as a Barbarian. This determines your starting proficiencies with weapons, armor, and Saving Throws. You could consider beginning Baldur’s Gate 3 as a Rogue to gain Intelligence and Dexterity as Saving Throws, but this would hinder your combat capabilities. Consider the following stats and choices for the first level:

  Parameter   Selection   Notes    Race   Half-Orc   They deal extra damage when making a critical attack, do not fall when reaching one hitpoint, and are proficient with the Intimidation skill.    Strength   17   Your key stat for dealing damage and accuracy in melee.    Dexterity   12   Improves initiative, armor class, and ranged attacks.   



  Parameter   Selection   Notes    Constitution   16   Determines your hitpoints and armor class when not wearing armor.    Intelligence   8   Used for some skills and an uncommon Saving Throw.    Wisdom   13   One of the most common Saving Throws.    Charisma   8   Used for some skills and an uncommon Saving Throw.    Background   Performer   Grants the skills of Acrobatics and Performance.    Skills   Athletics, Perception   Both skills are highly useful in combat and while exploring the world.   






How To Level Up a Barbarian Multiclass
Eventually, you want to wind up with a class combination of six Barbarian, three Fighter, and three Rogue levels. However, the order is essential as you will spend more of the campaign at lower levels and will only be at a maximum level of 12 for a short time. You want to unlock all the key features before moving on to ones just for flavor.

  Class   Character Level   Feature Gained    Barbarian 1   1   Two uses of Rage per every Long Rest. Add Constitution to your Armor class when not wearing armor.    Barbarian 2   2   Gain an Advantage on all of your attacks for one round, but enemies have an Advantage when attacking you.    Rogue 1   3   Can use Sneak Attack for 1d6 damage with a Finesse or ranged weapon.    Rogue 2   4   Can Dash, Disengage, or Hide as a bonus action.    Rogue 3   5   Thief subclass: gain a second Bonus Action.    Barbarian 3   6   Wildheart Bear subclass: gain resistance to all damage except psychic while Raging. Can also restore 1d8 hitpoints to self.   



  Class   Character Level   Feature Gained    Barbarian 4   7   Improve Ability scores to equal 18 Strength and 14 Wisdom.    Fighter 1   8   Choose the Great Weapon style to deal higher minimum damage. Can also self-heal with Second Wind.    Fighter 2   9   Learn Action Surge, allowing an extra full Action use per short rest.    Barbarian 5   10   Deal an extra attack per Attack Action and gain increased movement speed.    Barbarian 6   11   Choose the Stallion aspect to gain hitpoints when Dashing. It even works with the Thief bonus action.    Fighter 3   12   Champion subclass: increases the chance of landing a critical strike.   






Feel free to switch the class order around if desired. Some might prefer having Extra Attack at earlier levels or delaying the use of Action Surge until later in Baldur’s Gate 3’s campaign. Regardless, a Wildheart Barbarian mixed with Champion Fighter and Thief Rogue is tough and cunning.
