## Literature Review

The Sword of Marvels is a strong weapon in Star Ocean The Second Story R. By getting it earlier than intended, you can breeze through half the story.





The Sword of Marvels does eventually fall out of favor, mostly once you get to the final portions of the game or while doing New Game Plus. If you have already progressed too far, obtaining the sword might not be worth the effort. Instead, consider making the Aeterna Sword. To make up for it, there is also a free Sword of Marvels in a late-game dungeon called the Field of Might; but, this is far past the weapon being as useful.





 Random Gift Boxes 
          

There is no 100% way to earn the Sword of Marvels, however, there is a loot box-style item called the Goodie Box. This can contain many different prizes, including the sword. Sadly, they can also result in a lot of junk which makes it important to have backup saves during acquisition and once opening the box.

Making a Goodie Box
The most consistent way of gaining a Goodie Box is by utilizing the crafting system. The main Specialty to concentrate on is Art which can be achieved by spending Skill Points from battle on Aesthetics and/or Sketching - whichever is cheaper for the character.



When starting a fresh new game, each character will begin with random skills. After picking up Celine Jules or recruiting another third member, concentrate on improving someone who already has high Art.







Next, you will want to pick up some Magical Clay. This can bought in the town of Marze at the local item shop. Once the item is in hand, use the Specialty menu to select Art, and then Create Strange Goods on the next submenu. Many items can be produced with this action, with a Goodie Bag being a possibility.



Create Strange Goods has a large table of possible creations. Due to the huge amount of RNG, be sure to always save before crafting. Additionally, even if a Goodie Box is made it won’t always have the Sword of Marvels inside. After checking the box itself, reload before the crafting action.




Stealing a Goodie Box
Another possible option is to steal a Goodie Bag. First, you will need to purchase a pair of Thieves’ Gloves from the item shop in the town of Harley. This also requires another Specialty skill, Pickpocketing. As with Art, you want a character to have a high investment in the skill to increase the success rate. Try to get to at least level four or five, though maxing it out is even better.

The main target mark is an old man at the Restoration Inn of Marze. A team leader has three chances to steal. Afterward, it becomes impossible for the remainder of the campaign. But, Star Ocean The Second Story R can always be reloaded. This will undo the restriction and allow infinite attempts to finally receive the Sword of Marvels.
