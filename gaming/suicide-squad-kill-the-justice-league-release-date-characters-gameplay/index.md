## Literature Review

After several delays, Suicide Squad: KTJL will return to the Arkhamverse as Task Force X takes on mind-controlled members of the Justice League.




Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will follow Amanda Waller&#39;s Task Force X, a team comprised of some of the DC Universe&#39;s rogues as they battle DC&#39;s primary superhero team, the Justice League. The title takes place in the same universe as Rocksteady Games&#39; Batman: Arkham titles, and instead of the team being inmates at the Belle Reve super prison, Waller recruits them from Arkham Asylum.




The series will, however, move outside the confines of Gotham City for the first time, with the majority of the game instead taking place in Superman&#39;s home, Metropolis. Metropolis is set to be over twice the size of Batman: Arkham Knight&#39;s Gotham, and has been invaded by the classic Superman villain, Brainiac. Brainiac has used his mind-controlling abilities to take over the city, and some of DC&#39;s most powerful heroes, with everyone who tries to enter the city being killed as a result. Somehow, Waller is able to get Task Force X into the city and tasks them with killing the Justice League and defeating Brainiac.

                  When Suicide Squad: KTJL Takes Place On The Batman: Arkham Timeline   Trailer dialogue and the appearance of some of the Arkhamverse&#39;s returning characters indicate when Suicide Squad: KTJL takes place on the timeline.

Through Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#39;s campaign, Task Force X will consist of Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark, and Captain Boomerang, who each come with their own specific set of skills. Given the team&#39;s rebellious nature, Waller uses remote-controlled explosives implanted at the base of their skulls to keep them in line.

As the game&#39;s title implies, several members of the Justice League will appear as boss battles, with Superman, Flash, and Green Lantern all falling victim to Brainiac&#39;s mind control. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will also feature the return of the Arkhamverse&#39;s Batman, and should provide some answers surrounding what happened after Bruce Wayne faked his death at the end of Batman: Arkham Knight. This will also be fan-favorite Batman actor Kevin Conroy&#39;s final performance in the role as he finished recording it prior to his passing in November 2022.

The only member of the Justice League who hasn&#39;t been brainwashed is Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman can be seen fighting Superman in some of the game&#39;s promotional footage and may be immune to mind control due to &#34;The Sight of Athena&#34;, which also grants her increased insight and the ability to detect others&#39; emotions. If so, she could be the key to saving some of the Justice League members, rather than killing them as instructed by Waller.




Amanda Waller has also formed a &#34;Support Squad&#34; from other DC villains such as Teen Titans&#39; villain Gizmo, Penguin, Hack, and Toyman to upgrade Task Force X&#39;s equipment. Lex Luthor also attempts to take on the brainwashed superheroes in a version of his iconic green Warsuit at some point, although this plan seems to be short-lived, as it is quickly damaged and Luthor is captured soon after, with Task Force X sent to rescue him. Given the game&#39;s live-service nature, it&#39;s possible that Rocksteady may add additional playable characters like Luthor in the future.

                  Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Every Confirmed Character   Suicide Squad: KTJL is set to have an impressive roster of DC characters, with several characters also returning from Rocksteady&#39;s Arkhamverse.   



 Suicide Squad: KTJL Is A Live-Service Shooter 
Suicide Squad: KTJL&#39;s Core Gameplay Is Different From Other Arkhamverse Games
         




Rocksteady&#39;s previous Arkhamverse titles have been single-player games with a strong focus on melee through its innovative Freeflow combat mechanic, which went on to be mimicked in many games that followed. However, Suicide Squad: KTJL is a huge departure from this, taking the form of a third-person, live-service shooter instead. There is still one element of the Batman: Arkham games’ combat included, however, as the player will see counter-esque warnings above their enemies&#39; heads to let them know when is the best time to attack.

Although Suicide Squad: KTJL&#39;s core gameplay will mainly revolve around shooting different types of guns - which feels odd for characters such as Captain Boomerang, whose whole arsenal is traditionally built up of boomerangs - each character will have their own unique skills. These will appear in finishers and special moves and will feature attacks that utilize Captain Boomerang&#39;s aforementioned boomerangs, or King Shark&#39;s brutal melee.




The team will also be using stolen items from the Hall of Justice to help them traverse Metropolis. Harley will use Batman’s grapple gun and glider to move through the city, Captain Boomerang wields Doctor Sivana’s Speed Force Gauntlet to move as fast as Flash, and Deadshot uses Gizmo’s jetpack to soar high above his foes. King Shark, however, doesn&#39;t need any gadgets as he can harness his mystical powers to jump to great heights.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League may have an open-world map to explore, but it also follows a mission-based structure, which can be revisited from the game&#39;s menu. These can be played in single-player, swapping between the characters on the team, or in up to 4-player co-op mode.

                  Suicide Squad: KTJL&#39;s Gameplay Already Shows A Big Problem With Combat   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is already under fire for being live service, but the new gameplay trailer has shown more troubling issues.   



 What Is Suicide Squad: KTJL&#39;s Release Date? 
The DC Title Has Faced Many Delays
          




Since its announcement at the DC Fandome event in August 2020, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has eyed several release dates. The title was initially supposed to be released sometime in 2022 but delayed this to May 2023. Then, after the game&#39;s first major gameplay preview at Sony&#39;s February 2023 State of Play wasn&#39;t well received by fans, the title was delayed once again to February 2024. Warner Bros. Games&#39; new &#34;Suicide Squad Insider&#34; episodes have confirmed that the title has not faced any further delays and will be released on February 2, 2024.


 

There was speculation at the time of the last delay that WB Games and Rocksteady would be reworking the game to remove its always online functionality and live service components, as these were one of the main causes of the backlash. This doesn&#39;t appear to be the case, and the delay seems to have been to further polish the game instead.




WB Discovery president David Zaslav has also doubled down on the idea of adding live service components to other upcoming WB games in a November 2023 earnings call (via. Seeking Alpha). Recent job listings have suggested that even single-player titles such as Monolith Productions&#39; Wonder Woman may be impacted by this (via. VGC).



 What Platforms Will Suicide Squad: KTJL Be On? 
Suicide Squad: KTJL Is A Current-Gen Exclusive
          

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a current-gen exclusive, releasing on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X and PC. The &#34;Suicide Squad Insider&#34; series has since explained that this will allow for faster traversal around the open world, with the hardware in modern consoles allowing for faster and smoother gameplay overall, as well as better visual fidelity.

Unlike 2022&#39;s Gotham Knights, Suicide Squad: KTJL was never intended to be released on last-gen consoles. This means that while Gotham Knights developer, WB Games Montréal was held back by trying to develop across both console generations, and ultimately canceled the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release of the game, Rocksteady has been able to build Suicide Squad: KTJL solely with the newer consoles&#39; specs in mind.






 What&#39;s Included In Suicide Squad&#39;s Deluxe Edition? 
There Are Also Pre-Order Bonuses
          

There will be two versions of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League available: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard Edition simply includes the base game, whereas the Deluxe Edition has several more cosmetic features. These consist of outfits based on the Justice League, with Harley wearing Wonder Woman&#39;s suit, King Shark wearing Superman&#39;s, Deadshot wearing a suit based on Batman&#39;s design that&#39;s color swapped to match Deadshot&#39;s main aesthetic, and Captain Boomerang incorporating elements of Flash&#39;s suit into his own.

The Deluxe Edition also includes three Black Mask Notorious weapons, Squad Golds Weapon Dolls, and a &#34;No Shade&#34; color swatch exclusive to the Digital version that appears to mimic the look of the comics&#39; cel-shading. It also contains one Battle Pass token redeemable for Premium Battle Pass access in what WB is hoping will be up to 4 seasons.






There is a disclaimer that states that this Battle Pass token may become redundant as &#34;WB Games may modify or discontinue online services with reasonable notice at any time&#34;, which could also stop access to the game entirely considering its online-only nature.




Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League became available to pre-order on November 15, 2023, and there are several Pre-Order bonuses for the game. Both the Standard and Deluxe Editions will contain the Classic Outfits pack, which sees Task Force X don their comic-accurate costumes, and a Rogue Outfits pack exclusive to PS5 Digital versions of the game. The Deluxe Edition will also grant 72-hour early access to the game starting January 30, 2024, allowing players more time to level up their characters before the game&#39;s main launch.
