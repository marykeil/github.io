The November 7th answer may be a common word, but there&#39;s still a chance that you could lose your long-standing win-streak by using random guesses. We&#39;ve provided a few hints for those who still wish to attempt the puzzle themselves before we fully spoil today&#39;s Wordle answer below.

 Hint 1  There is one repeating vowel.   Hint 2  The answer is used as a noun or a verb.   Hint 3  The vowels are in the 2nd and 4th positions.   Hint 4  A restriction on the size of something.

Today&#39;s Wordle answer is LIMIT.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which provided a little help with two incorrectly placed letters, &#39;I&#39; and &#39;T&#39;. Moving those around a bit we tried TYING as our second guess which only showed us more incorrect places for the two established letters.

Moving them around a bit more we assumed that the vowel might be repeated and we tried DIXIT. This proved our theory right and set us up for a solid Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer, and our fourth guess, LIMIT. Another puzzle down and a good-sized win-streak continues.
