# One Uncontrollable Baldur s Gate 3 Dark Urge Kill Locks Off Very Rare Loot


## SUMMARY

One such item that can become unobtainable is the Potent Robe, which is a valuable item for casters.   Certain Dark Urge actions are unavoidable, but very specific actions can be taken to ensure the Potent Robe isn&#39;t barred from being acquired.

## Literature Review

The Dark Urge can easily derail a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaign with even the best of intentions, and one moment makes this more obvious than any other.




Playing as a Dark Urge character is one of the most interesting ways to approach Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it can also make a number of the game&#39;s branching possibilities completely unavailable in a campaign. The Dark Urge offers an interesting balance between a fully custom character and a pre-designed Origin hero, allowing for the full character creation process but adding in a backstory and a healthy dose of murderous impulses. Although many of the worst thoughts of the Dark Urge can be curbed without much trouble, one that offers no such luxury permanently locks off some fantastic gear.




The Dark Urge frequently manifests as additional options in combat, some of which can have violent results if a character chooses to accept the more treacherous path. One early Dark Urge decision can kill an Origin character without much indication that its effects will be that disastrous, for example. Navigating a Dark Urge playthrough while minimizing lost opportunities requires a careful hand, although accepting the potentially harder road and giving into evil impulses can also be an interesting way to experience the story through a different lens.

  


 Killing Alfira In BG3 Makes The Potent Robe Unavailable 
         




Alfira is arguably one of the most memorable tiefling refugees in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, standing out thanks to her musical skills and recurring appearances throughout the campaign. In a Dark Urge playthrough, however, Alfira is doomed to end her story early. Alfira will show up to a camp with a Dark Urge character and beg to join the party, at which point her fate is sealed. Turning her away will result in the Butler taking care of her, while accepting her into camp will take her death into the hands of the Dark Urge character themselves.

Outside of losing out on her narrative arc throughout the game, killing Alfira makes it impossible to get the Potent Robe that she can offer the party in Act 2. A side quest to rescue imprisoned tieflings results in her giving up the robe as thanks to any party that completes it, but if she isn&#39;t around for the encounter, no one else will provide it in her place. Although there are plenty of other clothing options to pick up in its place, this particular piece does stand out as an excellent choice for casters, and it can be hard to find a good replacement for it at the same point in the game.




                  10 Most Disturbing Dark Urge Choices In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Playing as the Dark Urge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 means players will have to make a lot more life and death decisions, some of which have gruesome outcomes.    

One major feature of the Potent Robe is Gregarious Caster, which lets cantrips deal extra damage equal to the Charisma modifier of the character who has it equipped. As Bards, Sorcerers, Paladins, and Warlocks can all use Charisma as their spellcasting modifer, this is a great pickup for any of those classes to increase their battlefield prowess. Well-Liked and Well-Fortified doubles down on the Charisma advantage by turning it to a defensive focus, granting temporary hit points at the start of a wearer&#39;s turn equal to the modifier.



 It&#39;s Possible To Avoid Killing Alfira In A Dark Urge Playthrough 
          




The actual urge to kill Alfira in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is completely unstoppable, as is the Butler&#39;s murder of the character should she be turned away from camp. That doesn&#39;t mean, however, that there isn&#39;t a way to simply dodge the actual situation to begin with. Interestingly, this relies on using nonlethal damage, a feature that isn&#39;t frequently very effective in the game and often treats knocked out aggressors as effectively dead. In Alfira&#39;s case, however, a knock to the head at the right moment can save her from a much worse fate.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Weapons Update Could Change How Characters React To Your Worst Crimes   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 features many interesting options in combat, but one fundamentally doesn&#39;t work correctly in the majority of situations.    

A Dark Urge character trying to avoid Alfira&#39;s death needs to knock her unconscious in the grove, which will lead to another character showing up at camp in her place. This replacement bard is presumably intended as a backup for the narrative moment in case Alfira dies before her time, but as long as she&#39;s unconscious, the game will default to the stand-in. Unfortunately, the new bard has to die in Alfira&#39;s place, but Alfira will be alive and well in the morning. For anyone interested in a Potent Robe or simply intrigued by where her story might go, this is definitely the superior choice.






Non-lethal damage can be toggled in the Passive submenu on PC, or in the radial menu on console.






 Alfira Has More To Offer In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Ultimately, many Dark Urge campaigns are going to be all about burning bridges, fulfilling the murderhobo instinct that frequently haunts Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns with a unique narrative twist. Most situations don&#39;t have to turn out like Alfira, however, and resisting the Dark Urge&#39;s worst impulses can lead to an interesting story of personal challenge and growth while opening up more of the campaign&#39;s general content. Alfira herself is a great example of why turning the other cheek can pay dividends, and the Potent Robe isn&#39;t the only positive outcome of dodging her narrative exit.




                  Baldur’s Gate 3: Pros &amp; Cons Of Playing As The Dark Urge In BG3   The Dark Urge is an interesting option for custom character creation in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it&#39;s not the right fit for every campaign.    

Alfira isn&#39;t among the captured tieflings in Act 2 herself, but she does have a personal investment in seeing them rescued. The reunion that occurs when saving them is one of the occasional feel-good moments in the game, and a nice source of light for a Dark Urge attempting to take the higher road to cling to. Alfira and her rescued associate reappear in Act 3 for another couple of scenes that can&#39;t be accessed if she&#39;s dead, and although this later involvement doesn&#39;t bring loot with it, its worth seeing for those who want to experience as much of the story as possible.

There&#39;s nothing wrong with missing out on certain rewards or storylines in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as attempting to do everything that the game has to offer in one playthrough would be fundamentally impossible. Alfira&#39;s death, however, can be a surprising and somewhat frustrating one, and missing out on an excellent robe later on for a decision that was made by force isn&#39;t much of a consolation prize. Playing as the Dark Urge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a choice that has consequences, and unless specific steps are taken to dodge the scenario altogether, the uncontrollable urge to kill Alfira brings devastating results.
