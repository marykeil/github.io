## Literature Review

You can start unlocking Dr. Ratio’s full potential as a 5-star DPS character in Honkai: Star Rail by Ascending him and leveling his Traces.





After that, you will have to rely on his limited-time banner coming into rotation to obtain Dr. Ratio. This character specializes in dealing a high amount of single-target damage, making him lethal. Before getting to this stage, however, you will have to farm and muster up the required materials to level him up to 80, going through the several stages of character Ascension that often act as thresholds. These Ascension levels will impede you from further leveling him, so it is important to have Dr. Ratio’s materials in Honkai: Star Rail at hand and ready for use.




                  Every Honkai: Star Rail Character&#39;s Age, Height, Element, &amp; Path   Honkai: Star Rail features plenty of characters. While element and path are important for combat, heights and ages can be fun details to know.   


 Ascension Materials To Farm For Dr. Ratio In Honkai: Star Rail 
         

The first set of materials you will need to farm for Dr. Ratio is Thief’s Instinct and its evolved forms, Usurper’s Scheme and Conqueror’s Will, respectively. These items drop from regular Antimatter Legion units, including Baryon, Antibaryon, Voidranger: Distorter, Voidranger: Eliminator, and Voidranger: Reaver. Good locations to farm Thief’s Instinct, Usurper’s Scheme, and Conqueror’s Will are the Storage Zone and the Supply Zone in Herta Space Station. Logically, these items can also be obtained from the enemies when fought in the Simulated Universe in Honkai: Star Rail. You can also purchase some through Embers Exchange or obtain them from Assignments.






You will need to farm a surplus of Thief’s Instinct, Usurper’s Scheme, and Conqueror’s Will, as they are also needed for leveling Dr. Ratio’s Traces and unlocking his new abilities.




As Ascension levels go by, you will stop Dr. Ratio needing Thief’s Instinct and start requiring Usurper’s Scheme. Similarly, in the last few Ascension levels, you will stop using Usurper’s Scheme and start utilizing Conqueror’s Will. For this, it is recommended that, according to your needs, you start using the Synthesizer to transform three copies of the lower-graded material into its evolved form. This will also be the case with the Arrows items needed for Dr. Ratio’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail, as the three items are part of a single-item family with varying rarities.

                  Honkai: Star Rail - Jingliu Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   To adequately use Jingliu as a main DPS in Honkai: Star Rail, you need to build her correctly and pair her up with the best team comps.   




The second set of materials to farm to Ascend Dr. Ratio is called Suppressing Edict. This material can only be farmed from the Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Puppetry activity, located on the Artisanship Commission map of the Xianzhou Luofu. You will need a total of 65x Suppressing Edicts, so you will likely have to challenge the Shape of Puppetry activity in Honkai: Star Rail a few times. The table below lists everything needed to Ascend Dr. Ratio, divided per level threshold:

  Level Ascension   Materials   Rewards    Level 20 Ascension     5x Thief&#39;s Instinct   4,000x Credits        1x Star Rail Pass       Level 30 Ascension     10x Thief&#39;s Instinct   8,000x Credits      -    Level 40 Ascension     6x Usurper&#39;s Scheme   3x Suppressing Edict   16,000x Credits        1x Star Rail Pass       Level 50 Ascension     9x Usurper&#39;s Scheme   7x Suppressing Edict   40,000x Credits      -    Level 60 Ascension     6x Conqueror&#39;s Will   20x Suppressing Edict   80,000x Credits        1x Star Rail Pass       Level 70 Ascension     9x Conqueror&#39;s Will   35x Suppressing Edict   160,000x Credits      -    Total Materials     15x Thief&#39;s Instinct   15x Usurper&#39;s Scheme   15x Conqueror&#39;s Will   65x Suppressing Edict   308,000x Credits        3x Star Rail Pass      






Other than materials, you will also need to spend 308,000x Credits to go through all of Dr. Ratio’s Ascension thresholds. This number does not consider the additional 580,100x Credits consumed when leveling the 5-star unit with Character EXP Materials rather than regular gameplay. This, however, is not the most expensive part, as leveling Dr. Ratio’s Traces consumes a lot more materials and Credits in Honkai: Star Rail.



If you require more Credits, you can always farm more at the Calyx (Golden): Bud of Treasure activity in the Great Mine map on Jarilo-VI. Each challenge round costs 10x Trailblaze Power, though the rewards vary depending on the level you choose to face it at.






 Materials For Dr. Ratio’s Traces (Abilities) In Honkai: Star Rail 
          

After successfully Ascending and leveling Dr. Ratio to 80, you should start maxing out his active Traces and unlocking the rest of the extra abilities and stat buffs available in his skill tree. To do this, you will need many Thief’s Instinct, Usurper’s Scheme, and Conqueror’s Will. These items are obtained from the previously mentioned Antimatter Legion enemies in Honkai: Star Rail.​​​​​​​




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Ruan Mei Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Ruan Mei&#39;s Weakness Break buffs make her a top-tier support unit in Honkai: Star Rail with plenty of strong options for Relics and Light Cones.   

Besides these, you will need to farm Arrow of the Beast Hunter and its evolved forms, Arrow of the Demon Slayer, and Arrow of the Starchaser, respectively. These materials are exclusive to characters that follow the Path of the Hunt. They can be farmed in the Calyx (Crimson): Bud of the Hunt activity, located on the Outlying Snow Plains map on Jarilo-VI. Like the previous materials, these are part of an item family, so you are encouraged to use the Synthesizer in Honkai: Star Rail to get higher-graded material as you progress through the levels in Dr. Ratio’s Traces.

You will need a special material called Past Evils of the Borehole Planet Disaster at higher levels. This material is obtained exclusively from the Borehole Planet&#39;s Old Crater: Echo of War activity in Herta Space Station. Not too many are needed to max out Dr. Ratio’s skills, but you do have a weekly limit for Echo of War challenges, which may push your farming plans back at least a week. The table below lists all the materials you will need to unlock and fully level all of Dr. Ratio’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail:




 Dr. Ratio Trace Materials In Honkai: Star Rail    Thief&#39;s Instinct     41x       Usurper&#39;s Scheme     56x       Conqueror&#39;s Will     58x       Arrow of the Beast Hunter     18x       Arrow of the Demon Slayer     69x       Arrow of the Starchaser     139x       Past Evils of the Borehole Planet Disaster     12x       Tracks of Destiny     8x       Credit     3,000,000x      





These numbers consider Dr. Ratio at Eidolon level 0. At Eidolon levels 3 and 5, he increases the upgrade cap on his Skill and Ultimate, respectively. If you have reached these Eidolon levels, more items will be needed to get his Skill and Ultimate from levels 10 to 15.







The process of farming materials for Dr. Ratio is not complicated, but it can be long. Running through maps to defeat specific enemies and relying on Trailblaze Power to farm activities can be limiting, so it may take a while. Nevertheless, it is worth it, as this will allow you to use a powerful Imaginary DPS. Of course, you will need to provide him with a good build, but fully Ascending Dr. Ratio and his Traces in Honkai: Star Rail is the first step.​​​​​​​
