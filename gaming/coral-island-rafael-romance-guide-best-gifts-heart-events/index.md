## Literature Review

Rafael is a quiet and reserved blacksmith in Coral Island. He spends most of his time working in the shop or caring for the nearby graveyard.





Part of Rafael&#39;s appeal is that he is easy to find and talk to, although he takes a while to come out of his shell. On the other hand, he is a bit more picky with his favorite gifts than other romance options in Coral Island. If you can establish a good supply of his favorite items, you will unlock his Heart Events fast.

                  How to Upgrade Tools in Coral Island   To upgrade tools in Coral Island, players must deliver resources from their farm and the Cavern to the Blacksmith located near the Woodlands.   



 Best Gifts For Romancing Rafael 
          

Rafael&#39;s favorite gifts are much narrower in range than Pablo or Nina from Coral Island. Although he likes the universally loved pink diamond, his two favorite gifts are sashimi and Onyx. Sashimi is a consumable you can make once you upgrade your house to include a kitchen. The recipe involves fish with one piece of wasabi used with the chef&#39;s knife. Meanwhile, Onyx is a special gem that can appear in fire geodes or mystery geodes. You can also mine Onyx in the fire mine.



Rafael&#39;s birthday is on Fall 4. If you give him a birthday gift, you will gain even more Hearts than usual. If you don&#39;t have any sashimi or onyx come the first week of Fall, you can give him some of your leftover Summer crops, like corn, bell peppers, or lilies.







                  Coral Island: Pablo Romance Guide (Best Gifts &amp; Heart Events)   Pablo is one of two dateable blacksmiths in Coral Island. He&#39;s a charming, flirty, and helpful fellow with an odd love for all things pickled.   

 Likes/Dislikes  Items   Loved Gifts  Sashimi, onyx, pink diamond   Liked Gifts  Coconut, flower bouquet, all universally liked gifts not mentioned here   Neutral Gifts  Pickled okra, all universally neutral gifts not mentioned here   Disliked Gifts  All mushrooms, all universally disliked gifts not mentioned here   Hated Gifts  Fresh salad, all eggs, all universally hated gifts not mentioned here   





 All Heart Events For Rafael 
          

If your goal is to walk down the aisle with Rafael in Coral Island, you must go through each of his seven Heart Events in order. Once you get the required number of hearts to trigger an event, you usually have to wait until the next day before starting it (although there are some exceptions). Other Heart Events may require you to check your mailbox before you can join the Heart Event. If it is possible to see the Heart Event on a given day, the needed letter will appear in your mailbox when you wake up.




 Hearts  Day  Time  Location   2 Hearts  Saturday or Sunday  9:00 - 17:00  Coral Inn   3 Hearts  Any  9:00 - 20:00  Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith   5 Hearts  Sunny Weather  10:00 - 17:00  Outside Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith   6 Hearts  Any  9:00 - 20:00  Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith   7 Hearts  Any  9:00 - 20:00  Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith   8 Hearts  Any  9:00 - 20:00  Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith   10 Hearts  Sunny Weather in Spring, Summer, or Fall  6:00 - 11:00  Farm   



Most NPCs will max out at 8 Hearts. However, if the NPC can be romanced, like Rafael, you can buy a locket from the blacksmith brothers and give it to Rafael. This will unlock the last two Hearts. Once you get all 10 Hearts and see all the Heart Events, you can marry Rafael and start a new life together in Coral Island.
