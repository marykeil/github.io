## Literature Review

Markers for your map and various pings in Valheim can be created to help you remember certain locations as you travel across the massive open-world.





Many dungeons that take multiple trips to fully explore won&#39;t show up through some special in-game marker that automatically appears on your map. It&#39;s up to you to leave custom markers or craft portals in Valheim that lead you back to recognizable locations. This process is integral to your continued survival and the expansion of your supplies to take on bigger and bigger projects.




                  Valheim: Beginner&#39;s Tips &amp; Tricks For Survival   Valheim is a very deadly and challenging new survival game set in a Viking world. This guide shows players how to get started in this game.   


 Valheim - How to Create Map Markers 
          

No tutorial in Valheim will teach you how to create your own map markers, but you can easily apply your own icons to the world by double-clicking on the map when you have a marker chosen. Pressing the &#34;M&#34; key on the PC or the &#34;Map&#34; prompt on console will take you to a view of the open world. The bottom right corner of this screen displays five unique markers you can select and switch between.

You can choose any of these symbols to have a marker ready to be placed on your map with a simple double-click or equivalent button. Those who put down these custom icons can also type in a name for each of them to label certain places in the world of Valheim. This is a perfect way to keep track of places that don&#39;t show up normally, like a Burial Chamber or Copper Vein in the Black Forest, for example.






Clicking on a custom map marker a third time in the world allows you to cross it off with an &#34;X&#34; to indicate that you have already cleared or explored a specific location before.




If you&#39;re having trouble following your markers, you have the ability to press the middle button of your mouse on PC or a similar console input to ping a certain place on the map. This method is only temporary, but it can be a quick way to communicate an important area to every player on a server. This ping becomes visible as a waypoint in Valheim that can often be more noticeable in the world.

Learning to create map markers can be an excellent strategy for anyone looking to effortlessly indicate points of interest within Valheim and encourage cooperation between other players.
