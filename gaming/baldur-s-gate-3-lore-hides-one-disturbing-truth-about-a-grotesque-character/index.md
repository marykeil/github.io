## Literature Review

The tiniest Baldur’s Gate 3 detail hides a dark secret about a diabolical villain’s terrible plot. Here’s what it is, and where to find it.




The smallest details can provide a wealth of context in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and sometimes, that context can be incredibly disturbing. It&#39;s a masterwork of environmental storytelling: there are little details scattered everywhere throughout the game, and they&#39;re not always obvious. From BG3 Easter eggs most players miss to hidden mechanics to secret ways to complete otherwise obvious quests, it keeps the player guessing throughout.




But sometimes, Easter eggs aren&#39;t the only things lurking in the muck of a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 map. Subtle details, intended only to color in the context of a person, place, or thing, are hidden around every corner. If the player knows where to look, and what&#39;s implied by these curious little sights, they can learn so much more about the world their characters inhabit. And often, what they learn is disconcerting, grotesque, or just plain sad. One such detail is hidden in Act One&#39;s most perilous area, but there&#39;s a silver lining - it can be used to the party&#39;s benefit.

                  One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Illithid Power Is Completely Overpowered   There are a lot of good Illithid Powers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the way that one in particular scales makes it a uniquely attractive option.   


 A Teddy Bear In Auntie Ethel&#39;s Bog Implies A Sinister Plot 
         




Hidden in a dark corner of Auntie Ethel&#39;s Putrid Bog, there&#39;s a bloodied camp that contains a dark secret: a child&#39;s teddy bear, lying stranded in the mucky mire, abandoned like the rest of the camp. This is grim enough on its own. It&#39;s clearly implied that a family, or at least an adult and a young child, spent some time here, and judging by the blood splattered on the ground nearby, met with an awful fate.

But taking a closer look at the bear, it&#39;s even worse. The stuffed animal actually functions as a container, and can be opened to find just a single item inside. It&#39;s a muddy note, reading simply, &#34;Hold this every time you miss Mummy, baby. And DO NOT leave the camp. Back soon.&#34; Clearly, a mother and child made camp at this spot, but the mother had to depart for one reason or another - likely to find supplies. Whether she found them is inconsequential, as the two were clearly attacked at camp, and are not likely to have survived.

It&#39;s not much consolation, but for what it&#39;s worth, the teddy bear itself can actually be quite useful to the party. Since it&#39;s torn open and holds a note inside, the teddy bear can actually function as a lightweight, in-inventory container. It&#39;s easy to spot, even in a tiny menu icon, since it doesn&#39;t look like any of the other available chests and containers in the game. This can be used for inventory management in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: a player character might decide to put all their scrolls, ingredients, or salable goods into the teddy bear, keeping them separate in an easily accessible place.






 What Happened To The Putrid Bog Campers In BG3? 
Auntie Ethel&#39;s Lore Hints At Their Fate
          

There&#39;s no direct evidence to suggest what happened to the mother and child who camped out in the Putrid Bog, but a closer look at Forgotten Realms lore can provide a hint. Auntie Ethel clearly has a vested interest in having a child - not necessarily in bearing one, mind, but in obtaining one. That&#39;s her motivation for cutting a deal with expectant mother Mayrina, which kicks off the entire Auntie Ethel quest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. It may also have driven her to kidnap the child camping out in the bog.

But why is she willing to go to such lengths? Per Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 rules, there&#39;s a limit to the magical power a single person can wield. Large groups of people, however, can cast more powerful magic - and for hags like Auntie Ethel, access to these more potent spells is usually gained through the assembly of a coven. That means making more hags, which can be done in many different ways. While they can reproduce by more traditional means or, in some accounts, by alchemy, hags are also able to turn humanoid children into hags by eating them.




Auntie Ethel admits as much after the party beats her: in some of her last words, she states outright that she intended to eat Mayrina&#39;s child, turning them into a hag daughter. It&#39;s only speculation, but it&#39;s entirely possible that Auntie Ethel ate the child camping out in the bog, too, for much the same purpose. However, this is far from the typical method of hag reproduction. Eating children is effectively the hag&#39;s last resort: it suggests they attempted other methods, but were unsuccessful.

Auntie Ethel is clearly desperate to put together a coven, and given the situation in the wider Forgotten Realms, it makes sense. She even kidnaps another child, later on in Act Three. This could be an effort to protect herself during the impending arrival of the Absolute, which she&#39;s clearly aware of, as she immediately recognizes that the party is infected with Illithid tadpoles. She may also wish to keep her bog safe from trespassers. Her methods may be unconscionable, but her motives are certainly understandable.






 Why Does Auntie Ethel Want Tav&#39;s Eye In BG3? 
          

But a hag child isn&#39;t the only thing Auntie Ethel wants in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. She also attempts to trade a supposed cure for Illithid parasites for one of Tav&#39;s eyes. This has a sinister purpose all its own, but it&#39;s not necessarily related to her coven-building plans. Hags can use humanoid eyes to create a magic item called a Hag&#39;s Eye - usually suspended from a pendant, a hag can see remotely through one of these, using it to keep tabs on its bearer. This may be her intent for Tav&#39;s eye, but she may also have a simpler reason.

For one reason or another, hags love making raw deals. They&#39;ll often swoop in at someone&#39;s lowest point, offering what seems like an easy way out, but ultimately results in even greater misfortune. Ethel does this each time she appears in the game, including her first encounter with Tav. Letting Auntie Ethel take Tav’s eye doesn&#39;t cure them, but applies a permanent status effect called “Paid the Price.” This provides a &#43;1 bonus to Intimidation checks, but a disadvantage on all Perception checks, and prevents Tav from ever landing a critical hit. Like all Ethel&#39;s deals, it’s not worth it. It&#39;s simply calculated to cause as much distress as possible.




Auntie Ethel may be the most violently selfish character, if not the most diabolical character, in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. She commits horrific acts in the name of her own power, never second-guessing those she affects. She&#39;s a storybook villain, the witch in the woods who eats naughty children simply because they wandered off from camp. Once she&#39;s lured the party into her trap, she makes no effort to hide her evil, either. But most Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players won&#39;t know the full extent of it unless they notice the tiniest details.
