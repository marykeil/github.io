## Literature Review

2024&#39;s anticipated RPGs are full of rich storytelling and impressive combat scenarios, with many aimed to provide deeply immersive experiences.




The roleplaying game (RPG) genre fills a very important and necessary spot in the world of video games by giving players truly immersive worlds, often full of thoughtful narratives and rich combat experiences. In 2024, the calendar of game releases is already filling up with huge entries, such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and even the Nintendo Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Exciting adventures from large AAA game developers, as well as many smaller indie developers, are expected to be released throughout the coming months.
All confirmed 2024 RPG releases have been categorized by which quarter of the year they are planned for. Many games do not have specific dates just yet but are expected to launch during the year, so these have been given their own section at the end. It is also likely that some games have been missed or have not yet been confirmed to be coming during 2024 at the time of writing.

Roleplaying Games Releasing Between October 1 - December 31
        

Moving further out towards the end of the year, not many games have given official dates for that far out. There are only three roleplaying games currently anticipated during the final months of 2024. Of course, these final months leading into the holidays will fill up rapidly as the time nears. Metaphor: ReFantazio and Zodiac Legion have given a fourth-quarter prediction of when they will be launching, and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 devs have simply said it will be the fall, which means this RPG could even be as early as August or September.
