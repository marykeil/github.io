## Literature Review

The Greylorm is a secret boss you can summon and beat in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies through USB Sticks you find at certain locations on the map.





You need to find four USB Sticks to summon Greylorm using Calibration Data extracted from each device. Unlike the Mega Abominations in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, this boss only appears when you have completed the right steps; it doesn&#39;t show up on the map right as you deploy. Some USB Sticks are in red high-level threat zones, so stock up on power-ups or powerful weapons.




                  The Best Ways to Farm XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies   Farming XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is different from past titles, with the massive map providing new ways to best defeat waves of undead hordes.   


 How To Find Every USB Stick 
          

To find every USB Stick, you need to unlock the locations of UAV Towers by visiting the Orlov Military Base in Urzikstan. The base always spawns in area H2 and has a second floor where you can discover a detailed blueprint of every UAV Tower. This will mark the structures on your map in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, giving you the USB Stick locations and their respective Calibration Data.



When you reach a UAV Tower, simply interact with it to receive the Calibration Data needed to summon Greylorm on each USB Stick.









 How To Defeat Greylorm 
          

Once you have all the right Calibration Data, you have to bring the information to a Refractor Site to summon Greylorm. The quickest way to identify a Refractor Site on the map is to see where two Ammo Caches are close together. Most of the time, these loot sources are far apart, so this should be a dead giveaway to the location you or your squad is trying to reach in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.

You have to be within an Aether Storm to transfer the Data from the USB Sticks and force Greylorm to appear. Take some time to gather strong items like Ammo Mods or the Quick Revive Perk-A-Cola flavor. You&#39;ll need to be prepared to take down Greylorm, who happens to be a stronger variant of an Aether Worm enemy.

Aim for Greylorm&#39;s weak points to eventually wear down and defeat the secret boss. You and your squad will receive rare Schematics and tons of XP as rewards for taking down this oversized undead worm, giving you a way to craft powerful items for your next deployment in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.




When you have found the USB Stick locations and beaten Greylorm after the beast was summoned in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, use the Dark Aether Rift that appears after the fight to leave the Aether Storm.
