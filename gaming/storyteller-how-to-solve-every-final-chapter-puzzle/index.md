## Literature Review

Storyteller allows you to conclude a narrative by solving puzzles in the final chapter when you fill in prompts and fill in different blank panels.





There are 12 Chapters in Storyteller, with a Final Chapter containing four novels you have to fill in after you complete the main segments. Like the best point-and-click games, the prompts offered here are short, sweet, and fairly easy to understand. The novels in the last Chapter are Mad Husband, Mini Hamlet, Loose End, and Love Revolution, which each have eight panels you have to assemble to finish the story.




                  Storyteller Review: Tales As Old As Time   Storyteller is a brief but enjoyable puzzle game that tests the player&#39;s understanding of classic tales and their ability to undermine them.   


 Mad Husband: Edgar Murders His Wife 
          

The first novel eventually leads to a character named Edgar killing his wife, starting off the Final Chapter with a dark story you have to piece together. The narrative starts with Edgar being in love with a blonde woman named Lenora, a passion he explains to another girl named Isobel. Jealousy causes Isobel to collect poison and kill Lenora, a scene that completes half the tale in Storyteller.



If you are confused about which scenes can be constructed in Storyteller, feel free to use the contents menu at the bottom of the novel to determine which character is which and what tools you can use to craft a tale.







Edgar then marries Isobel, but a ghost of Lenora tells him how she was killed by poison, making Edgar enraged. Through his anger, Edgar grabs a bottle of poison in a nearly identical panel to Isobel&#39;s plot from before. In the final scene of the novel, Isobel lies dead, murdered by Edgar for killing Lenora in Storyteller.

 Mini Hamlet: Tiny Murders Uncle to Avenge His Father 
          

The second novel in the Final Chapter is far more complicated than the first, with the character Tiny killing his Uncle to get revenge for his Father&#39;s death. You have to find out who Tiny is, and therefore, who is his Uncle and Father from the other figures introduced in Storyteller. The first few panels show that the character dressed in green is the father to the people in blue and gray clothes.

The character in blue is shown to have a child with a red shirt and brown hat, who is actually Tiny in this Storyteller novel. The Uncle is the one dressed in gray, who kills Tiny&#39;s father because he loves the Father&#39;s wife. The Uncle is shown to throw the Father off a cliff, before the Father&#39;s ghost tells Tiny what happened. The last panel shows Tiny getting his revenge by throwing the Uncle off a different ledge.




 Panel Number  Panel Contents   Panel 1  Add the Wedding scene, Add Peachy (left), Add Bluey (right)   Panel 2  Add the Family scene, Add Greeny (left), Add Bluey (right)   Panel 3  Add the Family scene, Add Greeny (left), Add Hatey (right)   Panel 4  Add the Family scene, Add Bluey (left), Add Tiny (right)   Panel 5  Add the Wedding scene, Add Peachy (left), Add Hatey (right)   Panel 6  Add the Cliff scene, Add Hatey (left), Add Bluey (right)   Panel 7  Add the Séance scene, Add Tiny (left), Add Bluey (right)   Panel 8  Add the Cliff scene, Add Tiny (left), Add Hatey (right)   





 Loose End: Duke Shoots Detective to Avoid Prison 
          

The third novel shows a man named the Duke killing a King before also shooting a Detective to avoid going to prison. The first panel in this story shows the Duke looking through the eyes of a painting to see a woman fall in love with the King. Consumed by jealousy, the Duke gets a pistol while the woman then looks through the same painting to see the King be shot by the murderous noble in Storyteller.




Later, the Duke goes back to look through the painting&#39;s eyes once again to see the woman tell a Detective about the crime that just took place. The last panel here in Storyteller shows the Duke using the same gun that killed the King to shoot the Detective in cold blood. The multiple panels of the Duke using the painting can make this puzzle quite confusing, so make sure to pay attention to context clues from other images.

 Panel Number  Panel Contents   Panel 1  Add the Witness scene, Add the Duke   Panel 2  Add the Ballroom scene, Add the Duchess (left), Add the King (right)   Panel 3  Add the Gun scene, Add the Duke   Panel 4  Add the Witness scene, Add the Duchess   Panel 5  Add the Gun scene, Add the Duke (left), Add the King (right)   Panel 6  Add the Witness scene, Add the Duke   Panel 7  Add the Ballroom scene, Add the Duchess (left), Add the Detective (right)   Panel 8  Add the Gun scene, Add the Duke (left), Add the Detective (right)   






                  10 Best Puzzle Games To Play Right Now   Puzzle games can be very good for the brain, and are a lot of fun! Here are a few of the best in the puzzle genre for you to try right now.   



 Love Revolution: Knight and Maid Murder the Monarchs and Have an Affair 
          

The last novel in the Final Chapter is by far the most complex, with different characters having a lot of motives for killing one another. The Knight, King, Maid, and Queen are the key players in this tale in Storyteller, and it all starts when the King has an affair with the Maid. The Queen sees this happening from a nearby bush, and has the Maid arrested, locking her in a cage as a cruel punishment.

The King later rescues the Maid in the next panel, before putting the Queen in the same cage for kidnapping the person he was having an affair with. The Knight, unaware of past events, saves the Queen in the following Storyteller panel. The Queen tells the Knight about what happened, prompting the warrior to push the King off a cliff for kidnapping his own wife and putting her in such a position.




The Queen is not forgiven for her past sins though, as the Maid kills the Queen for what the Knight does to the King in the second-to-last panel. The final scene of this narrative sees the Knight and Maid as lovers at the end after all the royalty have died in Storyteller.

 Panel Number  Panel Contents   Panel 1  Add the Affair scene, Add the Queen (left-bushes), Add the King (middle), Add the Maid (right)   Panel 2  Add the Kidnap scene, Add the Queen (left), Add the Maid (right)   Panel 3  Add the Kidnap scene, Add the King (left), Add the Maid (right)   Panel 4  Add the Kidnap scene, Add the King (left), Add the Queen (right)   Panel 5  Add the Kidnap scene, Add the Knight (left), Add the Queen (right)   Panel 6  Add the Cliff scene, Add the Knight (left), Add the King (right)   Panel 7  Add the Cliff scene, Add the Maid (left), Add the Queen (right)   Panel 8  Add the Affair scene, Add the Maid (middle-not in the bushes), Add the Knight (right)   



The Love Revolution story concludes the Final Chapter, playing a special event called The Ceremony for anyone who has figured out each puzzle in the game. The solutions mentioned above are notably not the only way to solve each story, since several variations could also complete each narrative. The only thing you have to try and match is the title of the tale itself in Storyteller.




You should see a Crown in the box below the title of The Ceremony Page that you can pick up and place on a pedestal on the page to your left. An animation of the crown casting a shadow over the whole book signals that all the Final Chapter puzzles are solved, earning you the title of Storyteller.
