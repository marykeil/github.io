## Literature Review

The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet brings back the Legendary creature Glastrier for you to find and catch by completing various quests.





The quests tied to unlocking Glastrier are exclusive to Pokémon Scarlet, but there are ways to get the Legendary in Pokémon Violet despite this. Similar to finding the Legendary bird Zapdos, Glastrier appears on your map once you get a Treat item tied to the Pokémon. This food attracts Glastrier to the region, but you still have to explore the open world to track down this beast as it roams the wild.




                  Every Legendary &amp; Mythical Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: Teal Mask, Ranked   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s new DLC, The Teal Mask, introduces fun new powerful pocket monsters to the game, including the Teal Mask’s namesake.   


 Glastrier&#39;s Location In Indigo Disk 
          

Glastrier shows up in the snow-filled ruins of Glaseado Mountain near Glaseado Gym once you get the Glastrier Treat item from Snacksworth in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. The Treat is gifted to your character once you complete 10 Blueberry Solo quests in Pokémon Scarlet. In Pokémon Violet, you only need to finish one Group Blueberry quest to receive the same item.



Group Blueberry quests can only be done online with your friends, so Pokémon Violet owners need to be able to play online if they want to get a Glastrier Treat.

Blueberry quests are simple objectives you can pursue in the Indigo Disk DLC that usually involve battling trainers or catching Pokémon. These goals won&#39;t involve difficult challenges like beating Drayton&#39;s Elite Trial, but some will be easier to complete than others. You gain Blueberry Points (BP) from finishing these quests as well, which can be spent on items, increased biodiversity of areas, and more.



 How To Catch Glastrier 
          

Glastrier is a Level 70 Legendary Pokémon with a 1.6% catch rate, which makes them one of the hardest creatures to catch in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Ensure you have stocked up on Quick Balls, Ultra Balls, or Timer Balls that can increase the odds of obtaining this wild horse. If your team is lower than Glastrier&#39;s Level, you may have a hard time lasting in the fight long enough to catch the Pokémon.




Have Pokémon on your team that can resist Glastrier&#39;s attacks, inflict damage to the Legendary, and cause status effects like Sleep or Paralysis to even the odds. Bringing this Pokémon down to red health with a status condition will significantly improve the capture rate. Watch out for Glastrier&#39;s ability, Chilling Neigh, which boosts its attack whenever it KO&#39;s one of your Pokémon.

Those who find and catch Glastrier in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet can add a powerful Legendary to their team to help face nearly any trainer.
