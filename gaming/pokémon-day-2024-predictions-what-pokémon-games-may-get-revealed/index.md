## Literature Review

There are many new titles that can be announced during Pokémon Day 2024. Here are the most likely ones to be revealed during the event.




The next Pokémon games to be revealed will likely be presented during the special annual broadcast for Pokémon Day 2024. While The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have kept quiet about the next titles in the series, be they core games or spin-offs, there is a lot of speculation and many rumors about what games are next arriving in the classic franchise. Generation 9 was officially released with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet back in November 2022 and, throughout 2023, players got to play not only the base game but experience the two expansions that composed The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack.




Although it may be the end of the line for these two titles, unless there is one more DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Gen 9 should live on through more games, as is the case with most Generations of Pokémon. Gen 8, for instance, was kicked off by the release of Pokémon Sword and Shield, but the Generation itself continued to see the release of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, the Gen 4 remakes for Nintendo Switch, as well as Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a new core game format set in Hisui, an older version of the Sinnoh region.

                  Pokémon Gen 10 Games Should Steal This From Indigo Disk DLC (&amp; It&#39;s Not The Synchro Machine)   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet does something new with its trainers. Here’s what it is, and why it should reappear in Gen 10 games and beyond.   


 Gen 5 Pokémon Remakes Are The Most Likely New Games 
          




Among the many possible game reveals during Pokémon Day 2024, the most likely are those of the highly-rumored Gen 5 remakes, set in the region of Unova. With the exception of Gen 1 games, which have been remade more than once due to their nostalgic purposes and commercial potential, Nintendo has been consistently remaking all core Pokémon games in order. Most recently, in Gen 8, Gen 4’s Diamond and Pearl were remade, leaving the path set for the eventual remakes of Pokémon Black and White. It is uncertain if they will be released in Gen 9, but it seems like a safe bet considering some circumstantial evidence.



 Signs That Gen 5 Remakes Are The Next Pokémon Games 
          

Aside from the regular order that remakes are being released, which would make Black and White the next ones in line to be remade, there is a connection between Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Gen 5 remakes. The main theory is that the past and future theme, so abundantly present throughout the first Gen 9 games with the existence of Paradox creatures and the exploration of Area Zero, is somehow connected to the past and future forms of Opelucid City, in Gen 5’s Unova region. It seems like this recurring theme did not go unnoticed, and the connection may run even deeper.




As pointed out by SoulSilverArt on X, the Gym leaders of Opelucid City are the Dragon-type specialists Drayden and Iris. Both of these Trainers seem to have some connection to the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Drayden is the grandfather of Drayton, a student at Blueberry Academy and one of the members of the BB Elite Four. Although unconfirmed so far, Iris is also rumored to be related to Blueberry Academy’s Amarys. There are even signs in their name: Amarys’ Japanese name is Nerine, which is a flower similar to an iris. Another huge piece of evidence is the fact that Blueberry Academy itself is located in the Unova region.

Essentially, players visit Unova in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, even if on an off-shore institution with no access to the main continental area. Aside from these details, there are even more clues in Pokémon Indigo Disk hinting at Gen 5 remakes. Another example is that Duraludon’s new evolution, Archaludon, takes on the shape of a suspension bridge, which looks a lot like the Skyarrow Bridge in Unova. There is a lot of speculation among the rumors, but the logical order of remakes and the various connections to Unova within the highly popular Gen 9 titles seem to indicate these are the next games to be announced during Pokémon Day 2024.






It has become commonplace for Nintendo to tease upcoming Pokémon games and their content inside previous releases. Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ Hisuian Qwilfish, for instance, was described in a book within Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.






 Pokémon Day 2024 Can Have Some Surprises In Store 
         

While Pokémon remakes have an established release pattern, with several hints pointing at the return of Black and White, there may be some surprises during Pokémon Day 2024. The release of Pokémon Legends: Arceus in 2022 set a new standard for core Pokémon titles. Despite being seen as a spin-off, the game is actually part of the main series and essentially wrapped up Gen 8. Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released to both critical and commercial success, which is more than enough to have set a new standard for titles in the franchise. Nintendo has not announced any new games in such a format, but it may be working on it.




                  10 Pokémon That Deserve Their Own Spin-Off Game After Legends: Arceus   There are several Pokémon that could be put under the spotlight for a Legends: Arceus-like game, even if it is a spin-off. Here are some of the best.   

There is a lot of talk among the Pokémon community about new games set in Johto, and a title in the format of Legends: Arceus set within the main region of Gen 2 could make a lot of sense. Johto is full of rich lore set in the past that could be thoroughly showcased through a game that takes players back in time. Regardless of the region that is explored in an eventual Pokémon Legends: Arceus spin-off title, if Nintendo is, in fact, working on such a game, Pokémon Day 2024 may be the best moment and stage to announce it. Legends: Arceus itself was announced during Pokémon Day 2021.

Even though core games in the series tend to grab the most amount of attention, Pokémon Day is also an event where spin-off titles can get announced. Nintendo has been investing heavily in spin-off games in the series, such as Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, New Pokémon Snap, and Detective Pikachu Returns. As such, there is a chance for a new spin-off title in the franchise to be announced during Pokémon Day 2024. So far, there are no rumors as to what classic spin-off series can come back or which new spin-off games are in the makes.






It may be a little early for Gen 10 announcements, considering Gen 9’s Scarlet and Violet were released a little over a year ago. Between Gen 8’s Sword and Shield’s release and Gen 9’s first announcement, over two years had passed.




Even with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s several technical issues, the game was a commercial success and, following the pattern of commercial successes over the past few years, it is a great moment for the franchise to expand even more. Many of the future plans for Pokémon should be announced on Pokémon Day 2024, which is expected to occur at some point in late February.
