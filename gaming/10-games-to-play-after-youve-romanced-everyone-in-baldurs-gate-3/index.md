## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a general standout for romance options, but it isn&#39;t the only game with a strong lineup of companions worth pursuing.




Romance plays a big part of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and wrapping up relationship arcs can easily leave a gaping hole in their wake. With a strong cast of characters to build relationships with, there&#39;s more depth and variety involved than the more obligatory approach to love that some games traffic in. Luckily, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t the only title to feature a strong approach to the subject, so jumping into another experience is always a possibility.
Although some games like dating sims focus exclusively on romance, the best way to follow up Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is with an experience that likewise features a lot more than just love. Most qualifying games still fall into the overarching category of RPGs, but they can fit into very different sub-genres and flavors. The main linking element is that they all have choice-based romance systems and characters that are actually worth romancing, with enough options for most potential customers to walk away satisfied.




























 








 10  GreedFall (2019) Has Four Romance Options 
Genre: Action RPG
        

GreedFall isn&#39;t likely to blow anyone&#39;s minds like Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, with some janky elements and a bit too much walking dragging down an interesting fantasy world and experience. Characters and relationships, however, are serious standouts, and strengthening bonds is consistently engaging and rewarding. There are four total romance options in GreedFall, with three willing to couple with a female protagonist and three willing to couple with a male. Any are worth pursuing, although it might be worth checking on the process, as it can sometimes be easy to miss out.





 9  Stardew Valley (2016) Has Twelve Marriage Candidates 
Genre: Farm Life Simulation
        

Stardew Valley might not be very close to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in overall gameplay, but it&#39;s hard to ignore the influence it&#39;s had since its release. Although the Story of Season/Harvest Moon series has long married relationships with farming life, Stardew Valley&#39;s smash success led to a slew of imitators that means there&#39;s an option for just about every preference. Few come close to Stardew Valley itself, though, and it&#39;s still a great way to relax and woo 12 different marriage candidates.





 8  Cyberpunk 2077 (2020) Has Character Romance Simular To BG3&#39;s 
Genre: Action RPG


 







The launch version of Cyberpunk 2077 disappointed in some ways as an RPG, feeling more like a souped up action title than something with the level of choice and immersion that many people were expecting. The relationships, however, are still solid, with a couple of standouts in Panam and Judy. The new expansion Phantom Liberty doesn&#39;t include any new romances, but it and associated patches do fix up the game in a lot of areas where it was still lacking.





 7  Stray Gods (2023) Offers A Twist On Character Romance 
Genre: Roleplaying Musical
        

Stray Gods was written by David Gaider, the lead writer for the romance-heavy Dragon Age series, and his expertise in the matter definitely shows. The big gimmick here is that it&#39;s a musical, with branching song paths making for a particularly unusual approach compared to standard dialogue. For anyone who likes the idea and has even a passing interest in the Greek mythology that inspires it, the unique nature of Stray Gods and the strength of its romanceable characters is hard to ignore.

Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical is an interactive narrative experience like no other, with a brilliant score and engaging mythological mystery.








 6  Mass Effect Legendary Edition (2021) Has Popular Romances 
Genre: Action RPG
        

The full breadth of Mass Effect relationships can&#39;t really be experienced in any single game of the trilogy, which makes the Mass Effect Legendary Edition&#39;s compilation the perfect way to play. This BioWare title takes a sci-fi approach to game and narrative design elements more commonly found in fantasy works and builds something truly unique. Characters like Garrus and Miranda still have passionate fans today, and it&#39;s unlikely that they&#39;ll be forgotten anytime soon.





 5  Persona 5 Royal (2019) Has Many Characters To Date 
Genre: Turn-Based RPG
        

The Persona games follow a different format from most JRPGs, with a heavy focus on social systems to accompany dungeon-crawling and general quests. Although some competitors have picked up on similar formats by now, Persona 5: Royal still stands head and shoulders above most alternatives. Over the course of a journey that could be just as long or longer than a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 playthrough, a handful of datable characters make for excellent romances, although it&#39;s all purely optional in the end.

 4  The Witcher 3 (2015) Has A Classic Romance Decision 
Genre: Action RPG


 







Many people have likely heard of Yennefer and Triss without having played, read, or watched any incarnation of The Witcher, and there&#39;s good reason. These standout characters provide two compelling romance options in The Witcher 3, along with a number of other possible dalliances. Although only the main duo can become protagonist Geralt&#39;s official partner by the end, there&#39;s plenty to pursue in terms of general romance, and choosing between Yennefer and Triss is worth the price of admission alone.





 3  Fire Emblem Awakening (2012) Offers Many Memorable Characters 
Genre: Tactical RPG
        

Fire Emblem Awakening could have been the last hurrah for a storied series, but its enormous market success made Fire Emblem into the juggernaut it is today. The tactical combat is excellent, but the off-field interpersonal component is also a compelling aspect of the game. Fire Emblem: Three Houses is another solid option for anyone who doesn&#39;t own a 3DS, but Awakening&#39;s memorable characters are still hard to beat.





 2  Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (2021) Is A Lot Like BG3 
Genre: Isometric RPG
        

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a fairly similar game to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 overall, using the Pathfinder tabletop system as a basis instead of DnD&#39;s fifth edition. It&#39;s also a genuine competitor in the romance category, standing head and shoulders above most RPGs with a fascinating cast of party characters and compelling options for relationships. Its predecessor Pathfinder: Kingmaker also has some solid options, but Wrath of the Righteous improves on enough aspects in general to be the more appealing choice.

 1  Dragon Age: Origins (2009) Offers Complex But Compelling Relationships 
Genre: Action RPG


 







Dragon Age: Origins might just be the most obvious choice for a romantic follow-up to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The focus on romance in BioWare&#39;s RPG has set the standard for similar titles since, and there isn&#39;t much doubt that Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 itself owes at least a little to it. Relationships ultimately feel even more complex and compelling than they do in Mass Effect, and characters like Morrigan and Alistair have exceptionally strong story arcs in general that rival the best in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
