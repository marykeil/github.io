## Literature Review

Of the five ways Mass Effect 3 can end, the Perfect Ending is the most difficult to achieve. Players need high Total Military Strength to get it.





The best ending considered for Mass Effect 3 is when Commander Shepard and his entire Normandy squad survive along with planet Earth. However, to achieve this ending, you will need to meet the same requirements as the original. The process involves getting as many War Assets as possible. However, many of them are tied to difficult choices Shepard has to make.




                  Mass Effect 3â€™s Ending Is Better Than You Think   Albeit flawed, Mass Effect 3&#39;s ending is redeemed by having one of the most complex choices in the trilogy that sets up the story for the next game.   


 How Mass Effect 3&#39;s Best Ending Changed 
          

The Perfect Ending in Mass Effect 3 is directly tied to Total Military Strength, what once was the Galactic Readiness system in the original ME3. In the original version, players needed an exceptionally high Galactic Readiness and Effective Military Strength score to unlock the Perfect Ending, which required them to use the multiplayer mode and the tie-in applications.

The rebalancing of War Assets and the Military Strength system in Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and the elimination of multiplayer, means players need to earn a greater number of War Assets to achieve this outcome. Here&#39;s how to gain the necessary War Assets to unlock the Perfect Ending in Mass Effect 3.



 ME3 Best Ending Requirements 
          

To get the Perfect Ending in Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition, you will need to amass at least 7800 Military Strength. The Military Strength in the Legendary Edition is calculated based on all War Assets Shepard acquires. These War Assets can be acquired via choices made throughout the Mass Effect trilogy.

While there is no way to enumerate how every decision might translate to War Assets, some general rules apply across the trilogy to ensure Shepard gets the maximum scores possible. These are:




 War Asset Contribution Tasks   Complete as many side missions as possible   Save lives/spare innocents whenever possible   Scan planets and complete mineral quests throughout the trilogy   



Apart from the above tasks, Shepard can also gain War Assets by helping allies or inspiring them to join the fight. For example, if Shepard chooses not to kill the Zhu&#39;s Hope colonists on Feros, paralyzes them, and spares Shiala, these outcomes will be converted into War Assets later. Similarly, showing kindness to reporter Khalisa Bint Sinan al-Jilani across the trilogy and resisting the urge to use Mass Effect&#39;s Renegade interrupt and punch her instead comes with the perk of extra War Assets.

War Assets can also gain or lose points based on decisions made across the trilogy, especially in Mass Effect 3. For example, if Shepard secures Grunt&#39;s Loyalty in Mass Effect 2 but chooses to save the Rachni queen in &#34;Attican Traverse: Krogan Team,&#34; Shepard gains 75 War Assets but loses 25, as Grunt&#39;s Aralakh company is slaughtered protecting the queen as she escapes. You can keep track of updates to War Assets at the War Table aboard the Normandy.






 Mass Effect 3: Perfect Ending Steps &amp; Choices 
          

Once you have gathered 7800 Total Military Strength or above played every mission and DLC content, you can get started with the Final mission, &#34;Priority: Cerberus Headquarters.&#34; This will lead you into the final moments of the story and the last chapter, &#34;Priority: Earth.&#34; To get ME3&#39;s best ending, you need to choose the Destroy Ending, i.e., activating the Crucible.

Earth and the Normandy Crew will all survive the blast. In the epilogue, Shepard&#39;s love interest, if they are a squadmate, will refuse to put the Commander&#39;s name on the Normandy&#39;s Memorial Wall. The final shot before the end credits will show the debris of the Crucible and Shepard taking a breath amid the rubble.






 You Don&#39;t Have To Replay ME1 &amp; ME2 
          

Players looking to simply relive ME3&#39;s best ending without playing through all three games shouldn&#39;t worry, as BioWare has also made it possible for players to begin Mass Effect 3 in Mass Effect Legendary Edition without importing a character and still reach the requisite 7800 Total Military Strength to unlock the Perfect Ending. To do this, however, players will need to complete every side mission and be very careful when making decisions to gain the greatest number of War Assets.

Completing Mass Effect: Genesis ahead of starting the game, will increase the number of War Assets they have access to, as they can import specific decisions that impact Total Military Strength later.
