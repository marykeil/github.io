## SUMMARY 


 2023 was a huge year for AAA games, but a number of independent games still managed to attract plenty of attention. 
 From puzzle games to retro RPGs, indie games in 2023 provided innovation in a number of different genres. 
 Some of 2023&#39;s best games were from small development studios, which don&#39;t have the development or marketing budget to match the industry&#39;s biggest players.

## Literature Review

Many great games were released in 2023, making it more difficult for smaller devs, yet numerous incredible indie games won over the gaming community.




2023 was a massive year for the gaming community as a whole, with many huge video games being released throughout, yet there were still numerous titles from the smaller indie developers that also managed to steal the show. From short, thought-provoking games such as Viewfinder to the larger retro-inspired RPG Sea of Stars, there are many different genres to experience while supporting the indies. Indie developers don&#39;t have the financial backing of the large AAA companies, yet some can still produce incredible works of art that they share with the world.
The past several years have seen an increase in recognition for indie-developed games, many of which have seemed to create their own recognizable style in retro formats. Although they do not have the same budgets for marketing and development that the big organizations have, several standout titles from small teams are getting better hype created for them by fans through social media channels. Numerous releases from talented indie devs launched in 2023, making it difficult to narrow down this list, but these are Screen Rant&#39;s recommendations of the best indies to try out from 2023.
            
 
 Best Indie Games Of 2022 
Among the many high-quality independent titles released in the past year, these are Screen Rant&#39;s picks for the best indie games of 2022.












 








 Silent Hope 
Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch
        

  Silent Hope  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC     Released    October 3, 2023     Developer(s)    Marvelous Inc.     Publisher(s)    XSEED Games , Marvelous Inc.     Genre(s)    Action , RPG , Hack and Slash     ESRB    E10&#43;    


Silent Hope seemed to sneak up without much fanfare before its release, yet this cartoony dungeon-crawler managed to hit all the right notes and earned itself a review of 4.5 out of 5 stars from Screen Rant. It blends the traditional feel of a dungeon crawler with unique mechanics of cooking, crafting, and the ability to swap between many different classes of party members while diving into the depths of the Abyss. The narrative tale it weaves is intriguing, leading players to want to push just a little more to uncover the next bit of story. With a bit of a roguelite dynamic of numerous runs through the Abyss, Silent Hope earns itself a spot as one of the best games and a hidden gem of 2023.





 Jusant 
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S
        

  Jusant  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    October 31, 2023     Developer(s)    DON&#39;T NOD     Publisher(s)    DON&#39;T NOD     Genre(s)    Platformer , Puzzle     ESRB    E    


Recently, many games have started incorporating climbing as a large part of their gameplay, but Jusant takes this mechanic to all new heights. The game&#39;s entire purpose and mechanics focus on climbing a massive tower. While it would be easy for this to take on a monotonous feel, Jusant earns its place as one of the best indie games of 2023 because it is able to take this deceptively simple premise and build upon it through creative puzzles, beautiful artwork, a subtly engaging story, and more.
            
 
 &#34;A Compelling Indie Adventure&#34;: Jusant Review 
Jusant&#39;s excellent climbing mechanics make it an enthralling game with a strong central purpose. Here&#39;s our review.








 Humanity 
Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5
        

Humanity tells a deep story that manages to explore spirituality, morality, and the very nature of humanity itself through a simplistic graphic design and surprisingly fulfilling puzzles. This puzzle-platformer inspires philosophical introspection as players guide massive flocks of humans to the light by taking on the form of a glowing dog. The mechanics of the game are simplistic, yet challenging, with a lot of variety and creativity in its approach.
            
 
 Humanity Review: Using Puzzles To Show The Beauty Of The Human Experience 
Humanity uses creative &amp; unique puzzle design to shake up the expectations of the genre &amp; tell a beautiful story about the human experience.








 Viewfinder 
Platforms: PC, PS5


 







  Viewfinder  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , Steam , PlayStation 5     Developer(s)    Sad Owl Studios     Publisher(s)    Sad Owl Studios     Genre(s)    Puzzle , Adventure     ESRB    Not Yet Rated     Mode    Single-player    


Viewfinder is a beautifully unique puzzle game that focuses on the scenery and environment to find innovative workarounds and creative means to solve problems. As was stated in Screen Rant&#39;s review of the game, &#34;there is no doubt that Viewfinder is setting a new standard for creativity and innovation that should raise the bar of players&#39; expectations out of games adjacent to it in the genre.&#34; The story for the game is not very deep because of Viewfinder&#39;s focus on creatively artistic puzzles, yet it is just interesting enough to not feel as though something is lacking.





 Cocoon 
Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch
        

  Cocoon  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    September 29, 2023     Developer(s)    Geometric Interactive     Publisher(s)    Annapurna Interactive     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , Puzzle     ESRB    E    


Another puzzle game, Cocoon is a unique take on the puzzle adventure genre, as the player travels through alien worlds, crossing between them through the use of colored orbs. Hopping between these worlds through the orbs is how the player can manipulate the environment and avoid obstacles in their path. It is a beautiful game visually with each world featuring strikingly different environments. The game as a whole challenges expectations and utilizes world-jumping and storytelling in new ways, making it one of the best indie games of 2023.
            
 
 &#34;An Intriguing Metamorphosis&#34;: Cocoon Review 
Cocoon is a fantastic puzzle game, combining an abstract world with a mind-bending, dimension-hopping core mechanic.








 Coral Island 
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S


 







  Coral Island  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    November 14, 2023     Developer(s)    Stairway Games     Publisher(s)    Humble Games     Genre(s)    Life Simulation , Simulation     ESRB    E10&#43;     How Long To Beat    22h 20m    


Coral Island is a tropical take on the cozy farming simulator genre with an abandoned and overgrown farm that needs work, romantic possibilities, and the side quests of chopping wood and mining minerals with the occasional monster to fight. Besides its unique island setting, the game sets itself apart by telling a story that promotes environmental awareness and cleaning up the oceans of the world. Players can even meet merfolk as they dive underwater and clean up trash and an oil spill that threatens the reefs. Launching after a year in early access, Coral Island is one that all fans of the cozy farming sim genre should try.
            
 
 &#34;A Cozy Experience In The Tropics&#34;: Coral Island Review 
A tropical-themed farm sim focusing on conservation, Coral Island hits all the right notes in creating a perfect island paradise and finding love.








 Dave The Diver 
Platforms: PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch
        

  Dave the Diver  


  Platform(s)    macOS , Nintendo Switch , PC     Released    June 28, 2023     Developer(s)    Mintrocket     Publisher(s)    Mintrocket     Genre(s)    Adventure     Engine    Unity     ESRB    Not Rated    


Dave the Diver is a difficult one to choose for a list such as this. It received a nomination for Best Independent Game for 2023&#39;s The Game Awards, yet has caused a stir due to the technical definition of whether it is, in fact, an indie title or not. The game itself is a wonderful release, however, and one of the few games to receive a review of 4.5 out of 5 stars from Screen Rant, primarily due to its delightfully relaxing gameplay. Like Coral Island, it also shows off the majestic beauty and wonders of the ocean, with care given to show the diversity of life under the sea. While on the surface, the game appears to be simple and silly, it earns its place as one of the best of 2023 due to the hidden depths that Dave the Diver holds.





 Lies Of P 
Platforms: PC, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S
        

  Lies of P  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PlayStation 5     Released    September 19, 2023     Developer(s)    Round 8 Studios     Publisher(s)    Neowiz     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Fantasy , Adventure     ESRB    M    


Lies of P looks as though it was created by one of the big game studios due to the amazing quality and care put into its artwork, music, and storyline. It takes the familiar story of Pinocchio and turns it on its head with a masterful narrative that is dark and gritty. The combat is challenging, fittingly so for a soulslike game, and an impressive amount of detail has been put into every aspect of the game. Lies of P earned a 4.5 out of 5 stars in its Screen Rant review, has won the Mac Game of the Year 2023 award from Apple, and was nominated for both Best Role Playing Game and Best Art Direction at The Game Awards.





 Dredge 
Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch
        

  Dredge  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 30, 2023     Developer(s)    Black Salt Games     Publisher(s)    Team17     Genre(s)    Adventure , Simulation     ESRB    E10&#43;    


Although it may look like a peaceful fishing game, Dredge creates a unique blend of atmospheric fishing and Lovecraftian horror. The mysterious storyline in the game lures players to keep trying to push the limits a bit more to unravel the secrets of the night, while also fishing or dredging to gather fish for the locals. Its atmosphere and artwork play to its advantage, with the player never seeing their own character and the darker tones of the game fitting the horror-tinged adventure in a way that sends a chill up the spine.
            
 
 Dredge Review: A High Quality Horror Catch Of The Day 
Dredge is a deeply atmospheric fishing game in a Lovecraftian setting, with a compelling gameplay loop and many secrets to uncover.








 Sea Of Stars 
Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch


 







  Sea of Stars  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , Steam , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5     Released    August 29, 2023     Developer(s)    Sabotage     Publisher(s)    Sabotage     Genre(s)    Adventure , RPG     Engine    Unity     ESRB    E10&#43;     Sequel(s)    The Messenger    


Sea of Stars is a turn-based RPG whose indie developer created it with the goal of paying homage to beloved games of the past like Chrono Trigger in not only an artistic style but through the story, soundtrack, and turn-based combat. It is filled with charming characters and a narrative that can hold its own against any major game studio release, landing itself on many players&#39; lists of not only indie game of the year, but as their ultimate game of the year for 2023. As Screen Rant&#39;s review coverage of Sea of Stars states, &#34;the gameplay choices it makes turns the game into a must-play for fans of the genre.&#34;
