## Literature Review

To obtain Marble Slabs in LEGO Fortnite, players must mine Marble from caves with upgraded tools and process it into Slabs with the Stone Breaker.





Marble appears as a white-grey rock on the ceilings and walls of caves and can be mined just like Granite. However, the starter Pickaxe isn’t durable enough to mine Marble, so you must upgrade your Crafting Bench to craft the Uncommon Pickaxe. This isn’t the easiest task, so you might want to get help from Fortnite&#39;s friendly NPCs.

The first step is to upgrade your Crafting Bench, which unlocks crafting recipes for higher-quality tools. Upgrading the Crafting Bench requires Wooden Planks and Shells, which drop when you kill Rollers. If you’ve fallen at some of the best landing spots in Fortnite this season, you may have encountered a boss or two. Rollers are practically boss-level enemies in the first few hours of LEGO Fortnite. They’re tough and can easily knock you out in two hits.

          




To slay a Roller, dodge, roll out of the way when it charges you, and then chase after it to score some hits with your weapon in Fortnite. It’s highly recommended that you take a more cautious approach when hitting a Roller at close range, so patience is key. Once you’ve got three Shells, upgrade your Crafting Bench so you can craft the Uncommon Forest Axe.



Rollers can also throw rocks at you if you’re within range, giving them a basic ranged attack.




          

To craft the Uncommon Forest Axe, you will need 3 Bones, which drop when you kill Skeletons, and 3 Wooden Rods. You will then have to use the Axe to harvest Knotroot, which is needed to craft the Uncommon Pickaxe.




          

Knotroot is a gray root that grows on the walls of caves and can often be found near Marble. Once you’ve collected some, head to a Lumber Mill and craft Knotroot Rods. You will need 3 Knotroot Rods and 3 Bones to craft the Uncommon Pickaxe. Once you have an Uncommon Pickaxe, you can head back to the nearest cave and mine any Marble you see.



Any nearby caves you’ve found will be marked with an icon on your map.

To get Marble Slabs in LEGO Fortnite, you need to build a Stone Breaker. This requires 20 Knotroot and 35 Marble, but once you have one set up, you can use it to craft Marble Slabs from Raw Marble.

If you are having trouble getting the right resources, a good approach is to get one of Fortnite’s Villagers to join you as you fight and mine. Getting Marble and Marble Slabs can be difficult if you haven’t got the proper tools, but once you’ve obtained the right upgrades, you should find enough for your building and crafting needs.
