## Literature Review

The Day Before releases soon, with an early access period and consistent global launch plan that lay out exactly when PC users will be able to play.




The early access release date of The Day Before is coming soon, and a road map has been laid out for the global launch of the game that makes it clear exactly when everyone will be able to play. Taking to the streets of a post-apocalyptic US East Coast, The Day Before offers an open-world MMO experience focused on zombie survival. Considering its status as an MMO game, understanding the launch schedule is uniquely important, as getting the jump on progression can be a serious affair for anyone looking to rise to the top.




The Day Before comes courtesy of Fntastic, the developer behind the co-op survival game The Wild Eight and the prop hunt experience Propnight. Although both of these titles have attracted a following, The Day Before steps up to a significantly larger scale, wrangling both PvP and PvE elements in richly detailed environments. The early access period should help this swing pay off, and responses to player feedback during the coming months could determine whether the game sinks or swims.


 When The Day Before Releases 
Early Access Starts December 7
          

The official launch date for The Day Before is December 7, 2023, when going by Pacific Standard Time, setting it up to be one of the last potentially major releases of the year. This will mark the beginning of the early access period, with a full release planned for sometime next year. Fntastic currently states 6â€“8 months as the planned window, which would result in a summer 2024 full release. As is the standard for early access titles, these plans are subject to change, so the lack of a hard date right now isn&#39;t a casual oversight.




The early access release date will still provide access to all the game&#39;s core functions, with a full implementation of multiplayer aspects and a completed set of features and mechanics. Plans for the full release focus on improving systems and introducing new content, increasing the variety of weapons, cars, and more. Although a price isn&#39;t currently listed for The Day Before, the Steam page states that &#34;the price of the game will increase in full release,&#34; ensuring a better deal for those who hop on during the early access period.

Console players are going to have to wait longer than the PC base for The Day Before, as the early access period is exclusive to the Steam release. The game was originally planned for a simultaneous launch across systems earlier this year, but delays resulted in the common strategy of focusing on PC first to hopefully get the essentials down. The most optimistic console release window that&#39;s likely to be realistic now would be summer 2024 alongside the presumed full release on PC, but when the time does come, it&#39;s expected to launch on both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.






 What Time The Day Before Unlocks 
The Day Before Launches Simultaneously Around The World
          

Rather than the game releasing based on local times, The Day Before is set to launch simultaneously worldwide, making it possible for all players to enter the servers at the same time. These times are consequently likely to be more convenient for some areas than others, but it does ensure that everyone has the possibility of entering an even playing field. Most of Europe and Africa come out with arguably the most favorable window, with a launch centered in the evening across a number of nations.

  Los Angeles - 10 AM December 7   New York - 1 PM December 7   Quebec - 1 PM December 7   Rio de Janeiro - 3 PM December 7   London - 6 PM December 7   Paris - 7 PM December 7   Cape Town - 8 PM December 7   Istanbul - 9 PM December 7   Moscow - 9 PM December 7   Astana - 12 AM December 8   New Delhi - 11:30 PM December 7   Bangkok - 1 AM December 8   Singapore - 2 AM December 8   Beijing - 2 AM December 8   Seoul - 3 AM December 8   Yakutsk - 3 AM December 8   Tokyo - 3 AM December 8   Sydney - 5 AM December 8   Auckland - 7 AM December 8  





 

As the game comes out on a weekday across all time zones, plenty of conflicts are inevitable, but the wait to play shouldn&#39;t be too long for anyone. Although The Day Before happens to be launching the same day as the Game Awards ceremony in some time zones, it&#39;s hours ahead of the ceremony, so one shouldn&#39;t have to be sacrificed to enjoy the other. It shares the December 7 release date with Ubisoft&#39;s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, making this a generally busy day in a month that isn&#39;t set for a ton of major video game releases.

                  The Game Awards 2023: Every Category &amp; Nomination   The Game Awards is one of the biggest annual events for the video game industry, and the nominees for all 31 categories have been announced.

Urban Open-World Survival MMO Shooter
         

As a survival game, The Day Before is focused on making incremental progress in a challenging world. The centerpiece setting is called New Fortune City and promises a more detailed urban environment than most competitors, which often focus on open areas sometimes littered with smaller abandoned settlements. Zombies infected by a global pandemic provide the main NPC threat, while players can attack each other in deadly PvP. The Woodbury survivor colony offers a safe zone to trade in items and build a new home without outside threats.

The Day Before is promising a lot, and its development has been met with its fair share of criticism from those who think it seems set to under-deliver. The early access period for the game should make it clear just what state things are in and whether it&#39;s worth the investment right now, and continued development can hopefully see it live up to its full potential regardless. Community feedback will be accepted both through Steam and social media channels, giving players a way to influence the development of The Day Before after it launches in early access.
