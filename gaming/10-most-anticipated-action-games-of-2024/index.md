 10  Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Is The Long-Awaited Sequel To A Cult Classic 
Coming March 22, 2024, For PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S
        

        


  Dragon&#39;s Dogma II  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 22, 2024     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , RPG     ESRB    M     Prequel(s)    Dragon&#39;s Dogma    


The original Dragon&#39;s Dogma had a lot of potential. Released in 2012, it&#39;s a highly customizable open-world action RPG: players design a main character and a Pawn sidekick navigating a deceptively simple system of classes, subclasses, and multiclasses to perfect their desired build. It&#39;s also a highly reactive game: fully-voiced Pawns respond realistically to whatever they encounter, pieces of the environment are destructible, and the whole thing is colored by a day/night cycle that affects what happens when.
Dragon&#39;s Dogma was ambitious for its time, but had its flaws in the form of bugs and poor performance. However, it&#39;s since become a cult classic, and its sequel, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2, promises to deliver on the same charm with some serious next-gen improvements. With gorgeous graphics, new classes for protagonists and Pawns alike, and a bigger world than ever, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2is an action RPG worth watching in 2024.





 9  Granblue: Fantasy Relink Brings A Mobile Game To The Open World 
Coming February 1, 2024, For PC, PS4, And PS5
        

        


  Granblue Fantasy: Relink  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Steam     Released    February 1, 2024     Developer(s)    Cygames , PlatinumGames     Publisher(s)    Cygames     Genre(s)    Action , RPG     ESRB    Not Yet Rated     Franchise    Granblue Fantasy    


Based on the 2014 turn-based mobile game Granblue Fantasy, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is the franchise&#39;s first attempt at an open-world action RPG. It was first announced in 2016 with some gorgeous gameplay footage, showing off a gorgeous fantasy world and fast-paced, multi-character, Tales-style combat. Once scheduled for a release in 2022, Granblue Fantasy: Relink was pushed back during development, finally revealing its official release date of February 1, 2024, last August. That&#39;s given fans plenty to look forward to when it finally releases. Thankfully, trailers make the game look better than ever before, with epic fights against colossal, AoE-inflicting bosses, and a large cast of playable characters to choose from.





 8  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Is The Sequel To The Original Post-Nuclear Survival Horror 
Coming Early 2024, For PC And Xbox Series X/S


 







        


  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl  


  Platform(s)    PC , Xbox Series X/S     Developer(s)    GSC Game World     Publisher(s)    GSC Game World     Genre(s)    First-Person Shooter , Survival Horror     ESRB    Rating Pending     Franchise    S.T.A.L.K.E.R.     Prequel(s)    S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl    


Set in the irradiated wasteland of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series has always presented players with a challenge to survive. Navigating environmental hazards, physical anomalies, and mutated enemies, players are forced to scrounge up as much food, medicine, ammo, and gear as they need to survive. There&#39;s been talk of a large-scale S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sequel since 2012, and although there have been three more games in the series since the first one, its true successor is finally due to arrive soon.
Once scheduled for 2022, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl was delayed due to the war in Ukraine, where its development team is based. Instead, it&#39;s due out early this year - even though it doesn&#39;t have an official release date yet.





 7  Black Myth: Wukong Drops A Fabled Figure In A Soulslike World 
Coming August 20, 2024, For PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S
        

  Black Myth: Wukong  




Black Myth: Wukong is an upcoming Soulslike by developer Game Science. It features the protagonist of the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West: Sun Wukong, a magical monkey king whose impertinence causes Buddha to punish him. After doing 500 years&#39; penance trapped under a mountain, Wukong is freed, only to be roped into a pilgrimage to India with the Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang.
Black Myth: Wukong adapts this action-packed fable into a Soulslike hack-and-slash, in which players can use Wukong&#39;s transformative powers and extendable staff against hordes of enemies and enormous bosses. Soulslikes are always highly anticipated; there&#39;s something so exciting in the differing approaches to their punishing bosses, the implications of their sparse-yet-deep lore, and the rare secrets that most players never find. This one just looks especially fun, a wonderfully weird twist on an all-time classic.





 6  Suicide Squad Is A Villainous Co-Op Open-World Romp 
Coming February 2, 2024, For PS5 And Xbox Series X/S, March 5 For PC


 







        


  Suicide Squad Kill The Justice League  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X     Released    February 2, 2024     Developer(s)    Rocksteady Studios     Publisher(s)    Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment     Genre(s)    Shooter , Adventure , Action     ESRB    Not Yet Rated     Franchise    Batman: Arkham , D.C.    


Developed by Rocksteady Studios, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is technically a sequel to the Batman: Arkham games that began with 2009&#39;s Arkham: Asylum - only this time, players are stepping into the shoes of some of DC&#39;s greatest villains. It allows players to control one of four characters, all members of the titular Suicide Squad, as they chase down the mind-controlled heroes of the Justice League in an open-world recreation of Metropolis: Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, or King Shark. With the option for both single-player and co-op multiplayer, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League promises over-the-top, action-packed fun.





 5  Rise Of The Ronin Is Team Ninja&#39;s Next Historical Foray 
Coming March 22, 2024, For PS5
        

From Team Ninja, the developer of Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, comes another historically-focused action RPG: Rise of the Ronin. Set in the late 1800s, it follows the members of independent factions as they turn against the Tokugawa Shogunate in the twilight of the Edo Period. Like Team Ninja&#39;s other games, it should feature slick combat and thrilling boss fights. Unlike its other games, however, Rise of the Ronin sets itself apart by promising a totally open world and RPG-style character customization.





 4  Hades 2 Is The Sequel To An Indie Darling 
Coming Mid-2024, For PC
        

        


  Hades 2  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , Steam , Epic Games Store     Developer(s)    Supergiant Games     Publisher(s)    Supergiant Games     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Roguelike     ESRB    t     Franchise    Hades     How Long To Beat    35hours     Prequel    Hades    


Hades and its sequel are action roguelikes set in the world of Greek mythology. With hack-and-slash combat and a variety of unique abilities to obtain, every run is different - but Hades&#39; true strength is in its approach to story. Its branching paths and gradual pacing of revelatory information keep players guessing, and that should hold true in its sequel, too. Hades 2 focuses on a different protagonist, MelinoÃ«, with a whole new background and a distinct fighting style. It&#39;s only planned for release on PC this year, but as its predecessor was eventually released for all platforms, Hades 2 will likely come to consoles at a later date.





 3  Skull And Bones Is Ubisoft&#39;s Much-Delayed Pirate Adventure 
Coming February 26, 2024, To Amazon Luna, PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S
        

        


  Skull and Bones  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , Microsoft Windows     Developer(s)    Ubisoft Singapore     Publisher(s)    Ubisoft     Genre(s)    Action-Adventure     ESRB    M    


Skull and Bones is Ubisoft&#39;s answer to Sea of Thieves: an open-world, multiplayer pirate action game. In teams of one to six, players can board a variety of pirate ships straight out of the pages of history. They can arm themselves with cannons, mortars, and swords in order to overwhelm their opponents. Players will compete to gain riches in Skull and Bones, whether they do so by independently searching out buried treasure, or simply stealing it from more well-heeled ships. First announced at E3 2017, Skull and Bones has always generated hype, despite several delays and a troubled development cycle. However, it&#39;s finally due out in February of this year.





 2  Star Wars Outlaws Is The Open-World Game Star Wars Deserves 
Coming Late 2024, For PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S
        

        


  Star Wars Outlaws  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Developer(s)    Massive Entertainment     Publisher(s)    Ubisoft     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , Open-World ,  Sci-Fi     ESRB    Not Yet Rated     Franchise    Star Wars     Engine    Snowdrop    


Star Wars video games have had a good run the past few years, especially with the release of the Soulslike duology Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor, and the promise of a third game on the way. In the meantime, however, there&#39;s Star Wars Outlaws, which focuses on a whole new aspect of the galaxy far, far away: its seedy underworld of scoundrels, smugglers, and criminals. Star Wars Outlaws focuses on new character Kay Vess, a motorcycle-riding, gun-toting, dashing rogue, as she prepares for the heist of a lifetime.
Outlaws will take place across multiple planets in the Star Wars universe, with third-person combat and stealth action. Players will be able to traverse freely and approach situations differently at their own discretion. With Ubisoft attached, it basically sounds like Assassin&#39;s Creed in space, which may be the ideal video game setting for a Star Wars scoundrel.





 1  Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Is 2024&#39;s Most Anticipated Action Game 
Coming February 29, 2024, For PS5


 







        


  Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5     Released    February 29, 2024     Developer(s)    Square Enix Business Division 1     Publisher(s)    Square Enix     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Adventure     ESRB    T     Franchise    Final Fantasy 7     Engine    Unreal Engine 4     Prequel(s)    Final Fantasy 7 Remake , Final Fantasy 7: Dirge of Cerberus , Final Fantasy 7 , Crisis Core -Final Fantasy 7- Reunion    


The second installment in Square Enix&#39;s remake of the all-time classic RPG, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the most anticipated action game of 2024 - maybe even the most anticipated game, period. Picking up where FF7 Remake left off, FF7 Rebirth follows nine playable characters as they explore the world outside Midgar and hunt down the power-hungry Sephiroth. Roughly corresponding to the second act of the original FF7, this is where the trilogy may shine its brightest: a huge cast of memorable characters, a wide variety of minigames and side activities, and a gut-wrenching plot twist that leaves everybody shattered.
Questions abound about FF7 Rebirth&#39;s story, characters, and new combat mechanics. It&#39;s expected to depart from the original FF7 in some seriously significant ways - although just how significant remains to be seen. FF7 Rebirth will keep everybody hanging on until its February 29 release date for PS5. Like FF7 Remake, a PC release is expected to follow.
These are only a few of the action games due out in 2024, just a selection of the few players already have high expectations for. It&#39;s not exhaustive by any means - there are more action games planned for release, and 2024 will certainly bring its share of surprise hits to the table. Whatever kind of action games a player prefers, they&#39;ve got plenty to look forward to in 2024.
