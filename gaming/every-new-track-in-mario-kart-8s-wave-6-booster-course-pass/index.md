## Literature Review

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s last wave of content for the booster course pass, Wave 6, is adding eight tracks to the game that are past favorites.




Wave 6 of the Booster Course Pass for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe adds eight more tracks to the game by bringing back and remastering favorite maps from past titles. This is the last of the Waves included in the Booster Course Pass and possibly will be the last DLC added to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at all considering the rumors of Nintendo&#39;s next console being in development. All tracks added with this Wave come from past games, including one from the original Super Mario Kart that started it all on the SNES.
This final wave of Booster Course Pass content for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe launches on November 9 for everyone who either has a paid membership to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass or has purchased the Booster Course Pass DLC separately. In addition to adding four new racers to the roster, it also includes 16 Mii Racing Suits and a bonus Daisy Racing Suit when a Daisy Amiibo is scanned. The eight tracks in Wave 6 will form two new Cups: the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup, and are comprised of redesigned tracks from other Mario Kart games.
            
 
 Every New Character In Mario Kart 8&#39;s Booster Course Wave 6 
Wave 6 marks the final selection of DLC content in the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, and it has some big highlights to mark the occasion.













 








 8  Acorn Cup: Piranha Plant Cove 
Originally From Mario Kart Tour


 







Many of the tracks that have been added to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#39;s Booster Course Pass have come from the mobile game, Mario Kart Tour. Piranha Plant Cove is one such track that first debuted in the game&#39;s Exploration Tour in 2023 and uses an underwater ruins theme that is filled with Piranha Plants. In this version designed for Mario Kart 8, the track will be a combination of going underwater and on land and includes Thwomps, Cheep Cheeps, and, of course, Piranha Plants.





 7  Acorn Cup: Wii Daisy Circuit 
Originally From Mario Kart Wii
        

The Daisy Circuit track from Mario Kart Wii was a cheerful road course that weaved its way through a seaside resort. The original layout included a figure eight portion with statues of Daisy and Luigi as well as Baby Daisy and Baby Luigi and was decorated with daisies and other flowers. Staying true to the original theme, this course also follows a path through a charming seaside resort at sunset and features similar fountains remade with modern graphics.





 6  Acorn Cup: GCN DK Mountain 
Originally From Mario Kart Double Dash
        

Originally a track for the Nintendo Game Cube&#39;s Mario Kart Double Dash, DK Mountain shows off the lush jungle experience. As racers speed along, they find they are winding up and down the side of a volcano and have to avoid being struck by falling rocks and debris along the way. It is a fairly complex course with a large number of obstacles and tight corners but is beautifully designed for the Nintendo Switch to show off the greenery of the jungle.





 5  Acorn Cup: Tour Rome Avanti 
Originally From Mario Kart Tour
        

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe uses this addition in Wave 6 to show off its artistic use of lighting for the Tour Rome Avanti track. It is beautifully created on the Nintendo Switch and the moonlight effect and lights of the city are stunning. The track was first designed as part of the Night Tour in Mario Kart Tour; it is based on the city of Rome, Italy, after the sun has set. Racers must try to stay focused here as they speed through the city streets around historic landmarks such as the Colosseum.





 4  Spiny Cup: Tour Madrid Drive 
Originally From Mario Kart Tour
        

Another track from Mario Kart Tour, the Tour Madrid drive, lets racers explore a Mario Kart version of the streets of Madrid, Spain, while watching out for soccer balls. This course shows off landmarks such as Puerta del Sol and see areas of Madrid like the Market of San Miguel. The bright sunshine and vibrant colors of the city also give a peaceful feeling of having perfect weather for the race.
            
 
 All 8 Mario Kart 8 Wave 5 DLC Tracks, Ranked Worst To Best 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is almost done with its Booster Course Pass content, with Wave 5 just releasing. Here are each of the tracks added with this wave.









 3  Spiny Cup: 3DS Rosalina&#39;s Ice World 
Originally From Mario Kart 7
        

Rosalina seems to have channeled a bit of Disney&#39;s Queen Elsa for this track that originally appeared in the 3DS&#39;s Mario Kart 7. Rosalina&#39;s Ice World has slippery corners, icicles blocking the road, snowy caves, and even a chilly underwater portion for racers to experience. The snowy land is beautiful with a starry sky, reminiscent of Rosalina&#39;s Mario Galaxy origins, and blends spacey and snow together well with shades of blue and golden stars throughout the experience.





 2  Spiny Cup: SNES Bowser Castle 3 
Originally From Super Mario Kart


 







The SNES Bowser Castle 3 track is a recreation of the classic Bowser&#39;s Castle course of Super Mario Kart. The original game that started it all, Super Nintendo&#39;s Super Mario Kart, had much less impressive graphics than the Nintendo Switch is capable of having, so it looks quite different from the original. The familiar pools of lava and treacherous surroundings are just as iconic as ever, however, and there are still many similarities in the layout. In the original Super Mario Kart, the race was said to be taking place inside a large castle room. The course has also appeared in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and Mario Kart Tour.
            
 
 Mario Kart 8 DLC Has Created A Huge Problem For The Switch 2 
Mario Kart 8 continues to be a popular game and Nintendo has done amazing at providing updates and new content. But what about the Switch 2?









 1  Spiny Cup: Wii Rainbow Road 
Originally From Mario Kart Wii


 







Rainbow Road is one of the most iconic and familiar tracks that comes to mind when any Mario Kart is brought up. There are many different versions of the interstellar course across the different titles, and several of them have made appearances in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. This version of Rainbow Road from Mario Kart Wii is a more pastel version of the coloration and features guardrails in many areas. Typically, Rainbow Road is known for its dangers of twisty paths and no barriers to prevent drivers from flying off into space, and here, there appear to be several sections where the railings are removed to give a bit more of the classic danger.
