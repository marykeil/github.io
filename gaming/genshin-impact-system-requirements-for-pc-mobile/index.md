## Literature Review

The system requirements to run Genshin Impact on PC and mobile devices are surprisingly not demanding. This is what you need for each platform.





Though the title offers a relatively complex and wide-ranged world and gameplay system, Genshin Impact&#39;s system requirements are not incredibly demanding, regardless of the platform you use. Even with the game&#39;s recurrent content updates, most medium-range systems will be able to run it. However, a few older setups - both for PC and mobile devices - may struggle with making the game run at a decent level.

 System Requirements (Specs) For Genshin Impact On PC 
          

Genshin Impact’s PC system requirements are fairly simple, and many configurations can run it. According to HoYoverse’s official website, there are minimum and recommended requirements, the latter of which runs the game with better graphic quality and stability of performance. The title is not one of the games that work on any PC, but it is fairly easy to run for any modern setup.

The tables below list both the minimum and recommended specs to run Genshin Impact on PC:

  Minimum Requirements   PC    Operating system   Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit, or Windows 10 64-bit    Processor   Intel Core i5 equivalent or higher    Memory   8 GB RAM    Graphics   NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 and higher    DirectX   Version 11    Storage   30 GB   






  Recommended Configuration   PC    Operating system   Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit, or Windows 10 64-bit    Processor   Intel Core i7 equivalent or higher    Memory   16 GB RAM    Graphics   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB and higher    DirectX   Version 11    Storage   30 GB   





One of the main benefits of playing on PC is that you can mix and match hardware pieces from the minimum requirements and recommended requirements to be able to play, for instance.






 System Requirements (Specs) For Genshin Impact On Android 
          




The system requirements to run Genshin Impact on Android devices are more demanding than those for PCs. Although the specs are still considerably low, it is necessary to have a more recent phone model to run it. The recommendation is to have an Android device with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, released in 2018. Nevertheless, a few older systems can run Genshin Impact at a lower quality.

The tables below list the supported and recommended configurations to run Genshin Impact on Android devices:

  Supported Configuration   Android    Compatibility requirements   Arm v8a 64-bit device    Memory   3 GB and above    Supported system   Android 7.0 or better    Storage   8 GB   



  Recommended Configuration   Android    CPU   Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, Kirin 810 and above    Memory   4 GB and above    Recommended system   Android 8.1 and above    Storage   8 GB   








 System Requirements (Specs) For Genshin Impact On iOS (Apple) 
          

Because Apple devices are manufactured and distributed by a single source rather than various companies, the system requirements to run Genshin Impact on iOS are device requirements. For players to jump into the game and start experiencing the world of Teyvat and its several different playable characters, they need an operating system of at least iOS 9.0. This means iOS devices dating back to 2015 may be compatible and able to run HoYoverse’s RPG. The table below lists the devices that can run Genshin Impact on iOS devices and the required operating system:

  Supported / Recommended Devices   iOS    Devices   iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPhone 12 Series, iPhone 13 Series, iPhone 14 Series, iPhone 15 Series, iPad Air (3rd generation), iPad mini (5th generation), iPad Pro (2nd generation) 12.9 inches, iPad Pro (2nd generation) 10.5 inches, iPad Pro (3rd generation) 11 inches, iPad Pro (3rd generation) 12.9 inches, iPad Pro (4th generation) 11 inches, iPad Pro (4th generation) 12.9 inches    Supported operating system   iOS 9.0 and above    Storage   8 GB   






Although there are precise technical specifications, it is important for players to constantly check their system requirements before running the game. Executing the program without reaching minimum configurations can result in unwanted issues, such as lag and even system crashes. Even though the game is constantly getting new content, the system requirements have not changed since the game’s release in 2020. This may not last forever, though. 

Genshin Impact allegedly has a 12-year roadmap, which means with all the new content and constant patches, the requirements to properly run the title may eventually change to keep the game up to date with more recent hardware technology. Although this has yet to happen, the game is still receiving content and has a few Teyvat nations to get through before heading to Celestia.

As such, it should come as no surprise if a live-service game like Genshin Impact requires players to invest in better hardware to keep playing – Final Fantasy 14, for instance, is increasing its minimum specs as it heads into the Dawntrail expansion.
