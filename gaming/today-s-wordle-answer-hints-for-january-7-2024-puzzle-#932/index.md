The January 7th Wordle answer is STONY.

For our starting Wordle word today, we used IRATE which only provided a single &#39;T&#39; in the incorrect position and a bunch of incorrect letters. Moving forward we tried STOUT, this locked in a big chunk of the beginning letters and sent us on our journey to the answer.

STOOL was our third guess, followed by STOWS as our fourth, both added nothing but incorrect letters. STOCK was our fifth guess and when this proved wrong we started to get quite nervous. Luckily our newest win-streak is kept intact as we scored a Wordle win-in-six with the correct answer ion the end, STONY.
