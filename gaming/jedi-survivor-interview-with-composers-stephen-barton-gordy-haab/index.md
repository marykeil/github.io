# Jedi Survivor Interview With Composers Stephen Barton &amp; Gordy Haab


## SUMMARY 



  The score of Jedi: Survivor perfectly immerses players in the game&#39;s different planets and overall space, paying homage to the epic legacy of John Williams while also pushing boundaries.   The composers aimed to create a unique and distinct score for the game, only hinting at classic Star Wars themes in a few specific moments, in order to let the story stand on its own.   By using familiar themes sparingly and strategically, the music becomes more impactful and powerful, enhancing key moments in the game&#39;s narrative.

## Literature Review

Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab discuss Grammy nomination, Cal Kestis&#39; evolution, creating new Star Wars sounds, John Williams&#39; legacy, and more




Warning! This interview contains SPOILERS for EA&#39;s Jedi: SurvivorEA&#39;s Jedi: Survivor is the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order, continuing the story of Jedi Cal Kestis as he attempts to fight the Empire during the Dark Times in an action-packed game allowing players to become Jedi themselves. Set in the aftermath of Revenge of the Sith and the brutal purge known as Order 66, Cal Kestis has very few allies while attempting to maintain the ideals of the Jedi while also resisting the might of the Empire. Often facing overwhelming loss, Kestis&#39; story is one of the Star Wars timeline&#39;s most tragic and intense, and it&#39;s made even better by its rich and dynamic soundtrack.




Having been released for PC and consoles in April, Jedi: Survivor is one of 2023&#39;s most popular AAA games. This is partly due to its impressive soundtrack from composers Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab whose work has been nominated for a Grammy in the Best Score for Video Game category.

In honor of their Grammy nomination, Screen Rant got the chance to interview Barton and Haab where they shared insights about creating their own distinct Star Wars sound, adapting the legacy of Star Wars film composer John Williams, the dark evolution of Cal Kestis, favorite moments from the galaxy far, far away, and more.


 Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab Talk Jedi: Survivor 
         




Jedi: Survivor is a huge hit and a great sequel. A lot of that is dynamic story and gameplay but it&#39;s also how perfectly the score draws you into all the different planets and the overall space that&#39;s been created. Considering the epic legacy that is John Williams, what does that initial development process look like when you guys sit down to figure out how to create another great chapter for the galaxy far, far away?


Stephen Barton: It&#39;s a mixture of terror, terror and fun. You know, it&#39;s really fun. I mean, We knew from the outset, a lot of what the story was going to be for this game. So we kind of had a bit of an idea towards the end of the last one of the sort of things we were going to play with. We knew that Merrin&#39;s stuff was going to be really important because we knew she was going to have a big role in Survivor before it was even called Jedi: Survivor...going in we kind of knew the arc of it and every time you get to the end of the game, where there&#39;s a potential of a sequel you sort of you have it kind of in mind. So, yeah, and then I think then just to sort of, you know, step back to look at it...and then the terror sets in.
Gordy Haab: I mean, there&#39;s always a bit of terror. But, you know, the truth is we kind of looked at it more like having to live up to what we&#39;d done on Fallen Order than trying to live up to any other legacy. We really kind of leaned into our own personal aesthetic more. I have a history with Star Wars gaming. My first Star Wars game was The Old Republic, and I did both Battlefront 1 and 2 with EA (Squadrons as well). Each one has progressively sort of deviated a little not further away necessarily from you know, the original sound of Star Wars, but because the stories are different.
It&#39;s kind of updating to like a Star Wars 2.0, if you will, so we had the opportunity to really kind of do something unique with this score, so we really kind of stretched out, musically speaking, in a way that we knew would also please the fans because both of us are also huge Star Wars fans, so we wanted to make sure anything we do, you know, fits the moment and feels like it&#39;s part of that universe, but also is kind of pushing the boundaries as much as possible.





Stephen, feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but these Jedi games were your first big debut in Star Wars. Was there any kind of learning curve?


Stephen Barton: Absolutely. I mean, it&#39;s one of those where you get interesting dynamics of all of these things, especially when there&#39;s an existing franchise, and I had it last year with Star Trek as well, where you sort of come in there are people whose job it is to sort of protect the franchise and then I think incumbent on everyone else to sort of like run and test where the guardrails are. And it&#39;s like you wouldn&#39;t be doing your job if you didn&#39;t sort of occasionally run as hard as you could into those guardrails and see what really is a guardrail and what&#39;s sort of just an assumption.
The fun thing is figuring out what it means musically to be a Star Wars score and it&#39;s really such an open question. Ten years ago if you said to someone, &#39;Oh, there&#39;s going to be a Star Wars game and it&#39;s gonna have Mongolian throat singing&#39; I think personally they&#39;d be like &#39;Pardon? Really?&#39; and now it&#39;s been in both games and a little bit into The Mandalorian too.
I think it&#39;s just that sense of experimentation and if you look at the John Williams stuff, what&#39;s most interesting is we have this conception that he has a sound and he absolutely does in terms of the sound of those scores, but if you look as they develop, they develop a huge amount and like episodes 7,8, and 9 don&#39;t sound anything really like 1,2, and 3 with completely different ideas and the way they work. It&#39;s like the way film has grown in the last 50 years. You can chart it through Star Wars scores if you want to. So I think that for us, it&#39;s like sort of like looking into that development and saying, &#39;Okay, well what&#39;s the next step, and how does this relate to games?&#39; and that&#39;s really fun.





How do you guys find the balance between creating a new and distinct sound and using some of those classic John Williams motifs from the Star Wars movies?


Gordy Haab: So out of about 8 and a half hours or something like that, there&#39;s only really just maybe three or four moments where we even hint at a theme from the original scores. And that was very intentional, because the story is its own unique thing. We needed to make sure that it was a unique score but there are inevitable moments where it&#39;s called for. Without giving too many spoilers away. Vader shows up in the game and fights with one of our favorite characters. So we had to write basically a battle sequence that also captured the emotion of one of our favorite characters in the game. Going up against what is was feeling very much like an inevitably lost battle, and how do you hint at the Darth Vader theme for example?
We thought about it and we kind of approached it in a new way. We didn&#39;t want to do anything too verbatim because it&#39;s, it&#39;s not necessarily like in this game, the Empire or even Vader is like this, this presence is marching on you like warlike it&#39;s always more like this ominous presence more than anything. Even when Vader shows up, I was just imagining through Cere&#39;s eyes, she&#39;s, you know, frazzled. She&#39;s faced with this dark figure. It&#39;s almost more like a silhouette than it is anything so we kind of approached it that way with the music to rather than playing the theme verbatim.
We traced the silhouette of the theme, and did it with this low kind of gritty, dark stamp that just kind of bends around. The shape of the melody. You know, I&#39;ve mentioned this before in a couple of interviews that I think it&#39;s kind of a cool thing to point out, but like I have this poster in my studio of Darth Vader and it&#39;s just the outline of the helmet. It&#39;s just a black silhouette against his red background. But you know, it&#39;s cool but it&#39;s still very scary to have this kind of staring at you by this ominous figure. But yeah, it&#39;s just a silhouette. So we thought, what if we tried that with this theme, so even though we used that theme in the game, you know, for those important moments and called for it, even there, we&#39;re still kind of like trying to push the boundaries of how we approach it and make it fit more with this storyline.
Stephen Barton: I think that you know, the big thing is, we&#39;re early on Fallen Order, we had a thing where we like we said, like, we&#39;re going to treat these like precious gems, you know, like, the one thing you don&#39;t need to do with the music in Star Wars is sort of be the wallpaper on the kid&#39;s bedroom. You don&#39;t need to be like, &#39;Here&#39;s a Star Wars game! Did you forget, it&#39;s a Star Wars game. Oh, by the way, it&#39;s a Star Wars game&#39;. The music doesn&#39;t need to do that, and what&#39;s really interesting about the themes is when you do use them and saving them at the right moment. You&#39;re withholding, withholding, withholding, then when you do drop it, it&#39;s even more powerful.
Particularly, the Force theme was something that we thought of as this thing, where it&#39;s such a powerful moment, and we really only use it twice in the entire game and there&#39;s one place that is very subtle, and some people may not even come across it. And then at the end, we use it in the very final cutscene and there&#39;s just like, it like hits you like a ton of bricks. I think the other thing that you know, whenever we&#39;ve sort of played with these themes, it&#39;s sort of the ethos of how you use them and as well. One of the things we wanted to do was always present the music in a way that&#39;s very much how it would sort of be if John Williams were writing the sequence, what would you do with a theme, not merely just being like, &#39;Oh, how was it done in that thing?&#39; So it&#39;s always developed in some way or there&#39;s some new aspect to it.





Lucasfilm has been doing their High Republic novels and comics which are referenced in Survivor&#39;s flashbacks. One of my favorite moments is getting to see the Nihil marauders show up on Tanalorr, as it&#39;s effectively their first big debut moment outside the page. What was it like creating music for brand-new Star Wars villains?


Gordy Haab: I mean, it&#39;s a lot of fun because, this is like a first appearance that we you know, see in like a visual media. And so, it presents this opportunity to create something new, to kind of dig into what a character is about, you know, theme the character properly, sort of create the mood for the scene properly. So it&#39;s always a very welcome opportunity when we have those chances to kind of, you know, take a new character or a legacy character that&#39;s not showed up in a visual sense like this, and try to do something unique with it. And, you know, try to make it fit into the storyline without it feeling like, you know, we&#39;re putting this big stamp of newness on something it still needs to feel like it&#39;s organically part of the grander picture and the grander story of Star Wars.
Stephen Barton: It&#39;s a funny story with that scene. Funny enough because it&#39;s one of the scenes where you know, we were sort of seeing that in flashback. Because of the way games are made, we often have a cinematic where it&#39;s just like grayscale or like a gray box. And so when that cinematic first came over and we had the script, it didn&#39;t really say anything about them. Sometimes game scripts aren&#39;t quite as detailed as films with every detail and every single thing you&#39;re seeing on screen. Often it&#39;s very in flux. So that scene didn&#39;t actually have any of the background in it with the Nihil. And then when the cutscene came back in we got to finally see them in the background. I don&#39;t think we repurposed that music, but it worked and it was great. Yeah, but it was just literally we had no idea because it was just a gray background and then and then cool stuff appeared and we&#39;re like &#39;Ohhhh!&#39;.





                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   

It&#39;s safe to say one of fans&#39; favorite tracks from Survivor comes near the end of the game. Through Darkness has a wonderful meshing of character themes. What was the process behind that particular track and how much emotion did you want to try and convey there? (There&#39;s not a ton of dialogue in those final moments with Cal mourning both Cere and Bode&#39;s deaths).


Stephen Barton: That&#39;s true. You know, we come from and we come into that scene from a pretty dark sequence as well...our cinematic director sort of illuminated something, and this is one of the lovely things about game development because it&#39;s less so much about having a game director who says everything, the auteur thing doesn&#39;t really quite happen in games by the way, but from that you get lots of times where you never know who&#39;s going to be the person who sort of illuminates something, so we were writing the sequence and that&#39;s the shot where Cal appears at the door as he&#39;d built the funeral pyres and put bode on it, so you have this moment where he appears at the door and our cinematic director said, &#39;he&#39;s the Angel of Death&#39;, and like this is his lowest point.
So musically, I was like, &#39;Oh, I sort of understand what you want from the sequence now&#39;. And it&#39;s sort of this thing where you might have had some sort of sad, emotional tone and it&#39;s he was like, &#39;no, no, like, this is from Cal&#39;s perspective, you see him at the door and it&#39;s like Death himself&#39;. And it&#39;s interesting how games have now developed to this point because we used to be so much into bins of music where we&#39;d be like we&#39;re gonna have our explore music and our combat music and we still do have a bit of that but we&#39;re starting to tell these stories with these really deep layers of subtext and context to it. And that&#39;s immense fun because you can get a sequence like this and go and go to town on it. And, and yeah, just trying to weave in all the character motifs and really set it up, we wanted to leave you at the end where we know this isn&#39;t the end of the story, but it&#39;s like, we&#39;re setting up that moment of saying what&#39;s going to happen which sort of brought the most emotion out of it and the music becoming the things that aren&#39;t said are actually being said in the music to a degree.
Gordy Haab: It&#39;s very similar in a way to how we closed out Fallen Order which is, it&#39;s very focused on Cordova and his theme and then we open this game actually with the menu, it opens with Cordova&#39;s theme as well. So we&#39;re kind of tying it and trying to continue the storyline as best as possible and make it feel like it&#39;s all cohesive and connected. It&#39;s much more like scoring a film these days. Honestly, it just happens to be a 30-plus hour film.





Keeping that in mind, have you guys started talking about Jedi 3?


Stephen Barton: You know, the snipers are probably close and poised on a hill. So you know, as they sort of get things set up it&#39;s definitely something musically that we&#39;re very much thinking about in terms of what we&#39;re going to potentially do, and you know we just wait for the time when we start officially seeing the start of things. Officially, of course we don&#39;t know anything, but it is something you have in mind. Even when we were working on Survivor you know we&#39;re absolutely setting things up and there&#39;s obviously an arc there that&#39;s going places...even though that may be you know, a number of years away and all that.


One final question for you guys, and it&#39;s more of just a fun one: as best you can, is there a favorite moment you both have from Star Wars?


Stephen Barton: I think I would say that I always really liked the final duel in Return of the Jedi as a sort of something in the sense that I think it&#39;s one place they just let the sort of operatic grandeur of it play out and especially the shot as they come out from under the walkway when Vader figures out Luke has a sister, and then that&#39;s the point at which Luke kind of snaps and I think it&#39;s one of the great moments in drama, I mean, in terms of it&#39;s just the way it sort of sets up this grand sort of operative thing. And then you know, it&#39;s one of those rare payoffs and final showdowns that actually lives up to the thing that&#39;s heated up. That was one I think that just you know, it&#39;s one of the most beautifully plotted out arcs...and it&#39;s done with so little dialogue, but everyone knows like the whole sequence, it&#39;s imprinted on the brain.
Gordy Haab: for me, I mean, I&#39;ll start broadly and narrow it in but you know, my favorite film of the whole series is Empire Strikes Back. And, if I was to focus on any one particular scene in that film, I&#39;d say it has to be Luke arriving and Dagobah and training with Yoda, simply because everything up until that point has been kind of I mean, I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s been you know, kind of fun and games because it certainly was not, but I feel like this is such a turning point. It gets very serious in that moment, you know, like the singular line even to this day, like I get chills I can remember this as a kid, Yoda saying &#39;You will be...&#39; to Luke it&#39;s just like, oh my god, it&#39;s haunting. Like that&#39;s a turning point. It&#39;s like, oh, shit, this is real now, so I really liked that sort of big emotional switch.
