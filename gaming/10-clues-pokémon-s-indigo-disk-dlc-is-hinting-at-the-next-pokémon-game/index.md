## Literature Review

There are many hints in the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC that indicate the next Pokémon games are going to be Gen 5 remakes of Black and White.




Even before its release, there are several clues in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC that hint at the next Pokémon games, which may live up to expectations and years of rumors. Pokémon generations tend to last a few years and, while Scarlet and Violet’s release kicked off Gen 9 in late 2022, there are likely more games on the way to integrate the current generation. Gen 8 was initiated by Pokémon Sword and Shield, followed up by the remake duo Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and then concluded by the experimental Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which gave the franchise a completely new style of gameplay.
Because of how generations in Pokémon work, it is very likely that there will be at least one set of new games arriving in the upcoming years, even if they are remakes of previous entries in the series. Different from past generations, however, there are already several clues in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC that indicate the exact nature of the next titles in the franchise. Curiously enough, these small bits of information and fan theories actually line up with many years of speculation. It does seem like the next games in Gen 9 are going to be remakes of Gen 5 games, Pokémon Black and White.
            
 
 Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Hid A Massive DLC Spoiler In Plain Sight 
A massive narrative spoiler for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLCs has been hiding in plain sight for months, since the contents’ original announcement. 













 








 10  Gen 5 Remakes (Pokémon Black &amp; White) Are, Logically, The Next Ones In Line 
Diamond &amp; Pearl Remakes Were The Latest Ones Made


 







The first hint at the Gen 5 Pokémon Black and White remakes being featured as the next Gen 9 titles is simply the logical order. Nintendo has been remaking all of its core Pokémon games. It started with Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen in 2004, going through Gen 2 remakes HeartGold and SoulSilver in 2009, Gen 3 remakes Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire in 2014, and lastly, Gen 4 remakes Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in 2021.
In 2018, the company also released its second remake of Gen 1 games, Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Let’s Go, Eevee!, but that was mostly a strategy to help push Nintendo Switch sales rather than follow the regular order – the Pokémon series thrives on nostalgia, so remaking the Kanto experience for the current console generation was a good commercial strategy. Nevertheless, the next step may be to offer players a revamped experience in Gen 5’s Unova region, and aside from the logical order, there are other hints that back that theory.





 9  Blueberry Academy Is Located In Unova, Gen 5’s Main Region 
The Information Was Confirmed In The Teal Mask


 







One of the most crucial pieces of evidence to sustain the idea that Black and White remakes are on the way is that The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is actually set in the Unova region rather than in Paldea. During the expansion, the second in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack, players will be part of an exchange program with Blueberry Academy.
The sister school to Naranja and Uva Academies has already been confirmed to be located in the Unova region. The information was shared in The Teal Mask, the first DLC in the series. Pokémon Teal Mask setting up Gen 5 remakes was widely noted and players will, technically step into the Unova region while playing Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. This may be a clever way of introducing players and creating hype around the Gen 5 remakes.





 8  Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Past &amp; Future Theme Is Shared With Black &amp; White’s Opelucid City 
The Paradox Phenomenon May Be Connected To Black &amp; White
        

Another important hint that connects Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to Black and White is the shared past and future theme. While it does play a less important part in the Gen 5 games when compared to the constant presence of Paradox creatures in Gen 9, this theme is abundantly present in Black and White’s Opelucid City.
In Pokémon Black, the location is highly modernized, while in Pokémon White, it sticks to an older type of architecture. The Pokémon game leaks with Gen 5 connections make a lot of sense, especially when considering this recurring theme. When this stacks up with the fact that the Indigo Disk DLC will technically take players to Unova in Gen 9, then the amount of evidence really seems convincing.





 7  Many Returning Pokémon In Indigo Disk Are From Unova 
Fan Favorites Like Zebstrika Return


 







A less obvious hint that not all players may have caught onto is that the Indigo Disk DLC will bring back several Pokémon from previous generations. Still, many of them are actually from Unova. This does not necessarily mean anything, as inter-generation compatibility is becoming ever more present in Pokémon games, but it adds to the suspicion and rumors.
The return of creatures such as the Gen 5 starters and fan favorites like Emboar, Zebstrika, and Golurk can be a way of introducing new players to Pokémon from Unova, as well as hinting at a return to the region for veterans. At this point, this is largely speculative material, but it does seem to further indicate that Gen 9 may revisit Pokémon Black and White through remakes.





 6  Archaludon’s Design May Have Connections To Unova 
The New Creature Resembles The Skyarrow Bridge
        

The Indigo Disk may also be hinting at a Gen 5 remake through the addition of a new Pokémon. Archaludon, confirmed to be an evolution of Duraludon, will leave behind the skyscraper body design and take on one that looks like a bridge. The issue here is that it looks like a particular bridge in the Unova region called the Skyarrow Bridge.
As pointed out by Game Rant, when lying open to attack opponents, Archaludon resembles the famous landmark, mainly due to the fact that it takes on the shape of a suspension bridge. This may be a stretch, but like the return of several Gen 5 Pokémon in The Indigo Disk, this further adds to the theories that Gen 9 will explore Unova.





 5  Amarys May Be   To Iris 
Name Inspirations Play An Important Role In Establishing Connections
        

In addition to this, promotional material for The Indigo Disk DLC has already revealed a few of the Trainers that players will meet in Blueberry Academy. In fact, all members of the local Elite Four have been shared openly. One of them is called Amarys and there are theories that she may be related to Unova’s Iris. Not only do their English names have a resemblance, but their Japanese names as well.
In Japanese, the character Amarys is called Nerine. This is, much like an iris, a flowering plant of the shared Asparagales order. While simple, this connection does seem convincing, as names and other physical resemblances between characters in the world of Pokémon are often purposefully established. Other than their skin color, however, they do not share physical similarities.





 4  Drayton May Be   To Drayden 
Physical Similarities Are Also Used To Establish Connections
        

Another member of Blueberry’s Elite Four, commonly referred to as BB League Elite Four, is Drayton. This new character from Pokémon’s Indigo Disk DLC resembles another of Unova’s Dragon-type specialists, Drayden. Drayton and Drayden have very similar names, as well as the trademark white hair.
Additionally, Archaludon, a Dragon-type creature, is one of Drayton’s buddies in the upcoming expansion, establishing yet another connection to Drayden. In Japanese, Drayton is called Kakitsubata, which is a Japanese iris, while Drayden is called Shaga, which is a fringed iris. The last shared detail among them is their trademark pose, in which they extend their right arm forward as if trying to grab something.





 3  Crispin May Be   To Alder 
  Characters May Share Type Specialties
        

The similarities between members of the BB League Elite Four and Unova personas are not over, as Crispin may have some sort of connection to Unova’s Champion, Alder. The immediately noticeable similarity between the characters lies in their hair structure. Both have orange hair with a red top. Like Black and White’s Alder, Crispin is also a Fire-type Trainer, as he has been confirmed to own a Magmortar.
While their English names have no similarities, their Japanese names further add to the theories. Akamatsu (Crispin) and Adeku (Alder) are both species of trees. Considering how connections between names are important when establishing connections in Pokémon, it does seem like the new Indigo Disk is related to Gen 5’s Champion.





 2  Lacey May Be   To Clay 
All BB League Elite Four Members May Have Roots In Unova
        

The last member of the BB League Elite Four in The Indigo Disk, Lacey, is the toughest one to connect to any notable Gen 5 Trainer. Players have, however, noticed that there are similarities between her and Driftveil City’s Gym Leader, Clay. As mentioned by PocketPoof on Reddit, her hair clips’ design has a green element that resembles the green gem on Clay’s hat. Additionally, they share the same thick eyebrows.
While their names are not exactly anagrams due to how Lacey is spelled in The Indigo Disk, there are similarities once again in Japanese. In the Japanese versions of Pokémon games, Taro (Lacey) and Yakon (Clay) are named after root vegetables – this may even reveal that Lacey, like her relative, is potentially a Ground-type Trainer.





 1  Team Plasma May Have A Connection To Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Paradox Pokémon 
Team Plasma Could Be Involved With The Paradox Phenomenon
        

The final possible connection between Gen 9’s Scarlet and Violet and Gen 5’s Black and White is the fact that Team Plasma is caught doing genetic splicing, which eventually leads to the creation of Genesect. While lacking the notable flowing energy effect in Future Paradox creatures, the Mythical Pokémon from Gen 5 bears an uncanny resemblance to them in terms of their chunky metallic design.
While Scarlet and Violet did have Team Star as antagonizing figures, it did lack a villainous group like Team Rocket. It may so happen that Team Plasma is somehow involved in the Paradox phenomenon happening in Area Zero, but that is merely speculative rather than based on actual information. Regardless, there are several hints in the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that seem to hint that players will, in fact, revisit Unova through Black and White remakes further into Gen 9.
