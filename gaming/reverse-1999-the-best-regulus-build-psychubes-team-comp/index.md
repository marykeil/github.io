## Literature Review

Regulus is a high-ranking and unique main DPS in Reverse: 1999, as she gets a powerful critical bonus when she remains inactive for a full round.





Regulus is a Star Arcanist who deals Mental DMG. Her build revolves around Restless Heart and its ability to deal consistent critical hits. Because she needs to spend every other round inactive, she needs a team with strong secondary DPS characters. She also needs a Psychube that can take advantage of her unique critical skills.






Since Regulus has strong critical hit abilities, her best Psychubes should have a Critical tag. There aren&#39;t many high-quality Critical Psychubes available as of Reverse: 1999&#39;s global launch, but there are a few options. As the game updates, keep an eye out for new Critical Psychubes that can work for more of Regulus&#39;s attacks.

 The Best Psychubes For Regulus 
          

Thunderous Applause is the best Critical Psychube available for Regulus in Reverse: 1999. This wonderful 6-Star Psychube provides up to a 16% Crit Rate bonus. This can stack with both Regulus&#39;s naturally high Crit Rate and her 50% Crit Rate bonus from Restless Heart. You can only trigger Thunderous Applause&#39;s Amplification with Regulus&#39;s single-target Incantation, Treat For The Ears, but it is worth it. If you score a critical hit with this Incantation, Regulus gets up to a 32% Crit DMG bonus.




If you don&#39;t have Thunderous Applause, An Afternoon Nap is the go-to replacement Psychube. It is essentially a 5-Star version of Thunderous Applause with slightly different Crit DMG bonuses. This Psychube gives 13% more Crit Rate rather than 16%. Meanwhile, when Treat For The Ears gets a critical hit, Regulus gets a stack of &#43;3% Crit DMG. She can have up to eight of these stacks at any time.

Tomorrow Also is another decent Critical Psychube, albeit with a stricter Amplification. Its 20% Crit DMG bonus pairs well with Restless Heart&#39;s 50% Crit Rate bonus for a powerful punch. Then, when Regulus casts her Ultimate, she gets up to 20% more Crit Rate. When you pair Regulus&#39;s Ultimate with Restless Heart and Tomorrow Also with a fully leveled Amplification, Regulus&#39;s Crit Rate can reach almost 90%, almost guaranteeing your Ultimate will be critical.

You may prefer a Psychube that boosts all of Regulus&#39;s attacks rather than just Treat For The Ears. If you&#39;re of that mindset, you&#39;ll want to give Regulus Brave New World. A majority of characters work well with Brave New World thanks to its 18% Ultimate Might bonus and strong Amplification. With Brave New World, the first Incantation Regulus casts following her Ultimate will have up to 40% more Incantation Might.






 The Best Team Comps For Regulus 
         



Regulus is a great main DPS choice, but you&#39;ll need to be careful which Reverse: 1999 characters you pair with her on a team. You&#39;ll need a team that can provide DPS support while Regulus is inactive. This can limit your options for survival characters, who rarely have good DPS qualities. On the bright side, Regulus&#39;s best team comps include many characters that are easy to pull.




An-an Lee from Reverse: 1999 is the best support option for a team comp with Regulus, as she provides some of the best DPS support abilities of any support character in the game. She has an excellent mass buff, boosting DMG Dealt and reducing DMG Taken. Her Exorcism Time status improves her attack Incantation and her Ultimate, especially when her attack gets an extra star with Empower Incantation I, the special status connected to her Ultimate.



The big strategy for Regulus and An-an is to alternate which rounds they attack. Time Regulus&#39;s Restless Heart status with An-an&#39;s Break Time status, and An-an can use her Exorcism Time status in the next round while Regulus rests.







If you don&#39;t have An-an, you can pair Regulus with Baby blue, a 5-Star support designed with Mental damage in mind. Her base debuff weakens enemies in terms of both DMG Dealt and DMG Taken. Meanwhile, once her attack Incantation, Tea Party, has two or more stars, she can apply a specific Mental DEF debuff to her target. This increases the effectiveness of all Regulus&#39;s attacks, whether or not her Psychube only boosts Treat For The Ears.

Twins Sleep is the best budget option for Regulus thanks to their low-rarity and their dual crit &amp; Mental DMG support. Their debuff weakens enemy attacks and makes them susceptible to Crit DMG, pairing well with Regulus&#39;s high critical bonuses. Their attack Incantation is the same as Baby blue&#39;s, providing another Mental DEF debuff at two or more stars. Their Ultimate can inflict Nightmare on a single target, preventing them from acting. Other characters may have stronger stats, but Twins Sleep is a 3-Star character, so they can fill in as needed.




Since Dikke in Reverse: 1999 has strong sub-DPS skills alongside her healing abilities, she can act as Regulus&#39;s survival character in a team comp with any given support. Her healing Incantation is strong, but is more effective when her allies have less than 50% HP. This synergizes well with Regulus&#39;s rest rounds, as Dikke can devote her energy to attacking when Regulus cannot. Her attack deals with both Mental DMG and Genesis DMG at two or more stars to bite through enemy defenses. Dikke is great at holding her own and providing last-minute healing.

If you want a more passive healer, give Sotheby a try. She alternates between Cure and Poison statuses. Her Cure status heals her allies over time after she casts her initial healing Incantation. Her Poison status, on the other hand, slowly eats away at enemy HP long after she&#39;s attacked. If her attack Incantation is at three stars, Poison can last for five rounds. Poison picks up the slack for Regulus when she needs to rest, giving Sotheby some minor DPS abilities.




All in all, Regulus needs some steady DPS support or highly specific debuffs if she wants to end fights quickly rather than drag them out. With the right team, however, Regulus can be a high-tier main DPS in Reverse: 1999.
