## Literature Review

Tuesday, November 21st has a brand new Wordle word to solve and today&#39;s answer shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for most fans of the game.





For those who prefer a more challenging daily game, there are a large number of Wordle copycats. One of the more popular ones is Quordle, this game challenges players to solve four different Wordle words at the exact same time by sharing attempts and clues in between all four. This is great for players who find the daily Wordle a little too easy.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
November 21st #885
          




The November 21st Wordle answer is PIANO.

For our starting Wordle word we used POUND, this provided a perfect setup to solve today&#39;s answer with three correct letters, only one being in the wrong position. Moving forward we tried PHONE as our second guess which only added a few more incorrect letters but did lock down the only possible spot for the &#39;O&#39;.

After that, it was easy to reach the goal and score our Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, PIANO.
