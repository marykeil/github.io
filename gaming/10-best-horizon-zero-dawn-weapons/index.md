## Literature Review

Horizon Zero Dawn is an incredibly innovative game with plenty of weapons to be used and upgraded. Which ones are the best?





Although Horizon Zero Dawn has lots of weapons to choose from, Aloy can only assign a maximum of four weapons to her weapon wheel at once. This is more restrictive at the start of the game, so focus on the best weapons to buy first during the game&#39;s opening hours. From there, you&#39;ll get a better idea of which weapons you like best, and don&#39;t waste valuable upgrade resources on gear you don&#39;t like using.
 : Horizon Zero Dawn: Aloy&#39;s Weapon Types, Ranked From Worst To Best









 








 10  Aloy&#39;s Spear 
Standard Weapon For Melee Combat


 







How To Get: 
Automatically obtained at the start of the story, but is upgraded after certain story quests. 

Aloy&#39;s Spear is central to Horizon Zero Dawn&#39;s limited melee combat, allowing you to hit enemies with light and heavy attacks. The Spear can be particularly brutal against smaller machines, knocking off components and armor plating or even knocking them prone. This creates openings and weaknesses that you can exploit with ranged attacks.
To improve the Spear, grab spear-specific skills from the Brave Tree. These increase spear damage and allow Aloy to deliver high-damage Critical Hits to downed machines. Critical Hits can even kill smaller machines like Watchers and Scrappers outright, so spear skills are highly recommended even if you&#39;re fighting with ranged weapons most of the time.
 : Aloy&#39;s Spear Is So Much Better In Horizon Forbidden West
In summary, remember to use the Spear whenever you have an opening. You can also upgrade Aloy&#39;s Spear. During the In Her Mother&#39;s Footsteps side quest, Aloy can help an NPC in return for a permanent increase to her spear damage. There are also unique upgrades that appear during the main story, including the ability to override machines in Horizon Zero Dawn. Eventually, you will receive Sylens&#39; Lance, a significant upgrade on the Spear that also deals Shock Damage.
You can also upgrade the Spear with Weapon Coil Modifications by completing A Secret Shared, a side quest in the Frozen Wilds DLC. 






 9  Ropecaster 
Tie Down And Immobilize Enemies
        

How To Get: 
The Basic, Carja, and Shadow Ropecaster are all available from merchants. The Shadow Ropecaster can be bought from merchants in Meridian for 
500 Shards and 1 Snapmaw Heart.

The Ropecaster doesn&#39;t do much damage on its own in Horizon Zero Dawn, but it&#39;s the perfect tool for crowd control. It shoots ropes that latch onto machines, allowing you to tie them down and immobilize them. Immobilized machines are essentially defenseless, enabling you to deal extra damage or inflict status effects while they&#39;re tied down.
Aloy will gradually find better weapons and gear from merchants as she journeys further away from the Nora territory. Merchants in Meridian and the Carja lands tend to sell Shadow-tier weapon variants with the best stats and more slots for modifications. 

Notably, this works on all machines, making it one of the best gear for fighting Horizon Zero Dawn&#39;s toughest machines, such as the Stormbird and Thunderjaw. Flying machines such as Glinthawks are also prime targets. Tying them down allows Aloy to finish them off before they can flee.
You can buy the Basic, Carja, and Shadow variants of the Ropecaster from merchants. However, the best variant outside of New Game Plus is the Lodge Ropecaster. To get it, you&#39;ll need to tackle Horizon Zero Dawn&#39;s Hunting Grounds and complete challenges to earn 15 Full Sun marks. These marks can be exchanged for the Lodge Ropecaster at Meridian&#39;s Hunters&#39; Lodge.
Several Hunting Grounds in Horizon Zero Dawn provide different timed scenarios to test Aloy&#39;s skills in stealth, combat, and more. 






 8  Tripcaster 
Trick Enemies With Tripwires
        

How To Get: 
The Basic, Carja, and Shadow Tripcaster are all available from merchants. The Shadow Tripcaster can be bought in Meridian for 750 Shards and 1 Scrapper Heart. 

With the Tripcaster, Aloy can place various types of Tripwire in Horizon Zero Dawn. These inflict different types of elemental damage on enemies that cross them, including Fire and Shock, and can even stun or burn them. This makes the Tripcaster one of the best tools for stopping rampaging machines in their tracks, and they give Aloy a much more even footing on unpredictable battlefields.
All Tripcasters have Shock Wires, which deal Shock Damage. However, the fully upgraded Shadow Tripcaster variant also has Fire Wires and Blast Wires, which explode when crossed, potentially blasting machines apart on contact.





 7  Machine Weapons 
A Limited High-Tech Option For Combat


 







How To Get: 
Tear off certain machines (Deathbringers, Thunderjaws, Scorchers, Ravagers) 

One of the best ways to defeat a tough machine in Horizon Zero Dawn is to turn its own weapons against it. Many of the game&#39;s toughest machines come equipped specifically for combat, with heavy weapons meant to kill machine hunters. Aloy can use various weapons that deal Tear damage to blast off them before picking them up and using them herself.
It&#39;s possible to override machines and knock off their weapons when they aren&#39;t hostile, but it can also be done in combat. The Tearblaster and Tearblast Arrows are easily the best tools for this, as they&#39;re designed specifically to knock off components while dealing no damage.
This tactic works particularly well with Ravagers and Thunderjaws, both tough machines surprisingly vulnerable to their weapons. There are also many combat encounters in Horizon Zero Dawn where Aloy faces multiple machine types at once. As such, you can take a high-tech cannon from a tough machine and use it to wipe out a horde of weaker machines with minimal effort.





 6  Blast Sling 
Lob Explosive Bombs At Enemies
        

How To Get 
The Basic, Carja and Shadow Blast Sling are all available from merchants. The Shadow Tripcaster can be bought in Meridian for 1,400 Shards and 1 Lancehorn Heart. 

The Blast Sling is essentially a slingshot for bombs, and Aloy can use it to throw explosives at enemies. The basic Blast Bomb ammo deals explosive damage on impact and can blast off or destroy machine components. More advanced variants of the Blast Sling have additional ammo types, including Sticky Bombs and Proximity Bombs.
They&#39;re particularly good at destroying certain sensitive components, such as Snapmaw Freeze Sacs and Bellowback Cargo Sacs, which explode when hit and inflict additional status effects. The Lodge Blast Sling is the best variant outside New Game Plus, but like the Lodge Ropecaster, you&#39;ll need to complete Hunting Grounds challenges to get it.
To get the Lodge Blast Sling from the Hunters&#39; Lodge, you need 15 Half-Sun Marks from Hunting Grounds. 






 5  War Bow 
Deal Elemental Damage From Range
        

How To Get: 
The Basic, Carja, and Shadow War Bow are all available from merchants. The Shadow Tripcaster can be bought in Meridian for 800 Shards and 1 Trampler Heart. 

The War Bow has specialized arrows that allow Aloy to deal elemental damage from range. All War Bows come with Shock Arrows for dealing with Shock Damage by default, but upgraded variants also have Freeze and Corruption Arrows. As such, War Bows are a highly versatile weapon type, allowing Aloy to deal with various elemental damage types to trigger status effects.
However, when using the War Bow, you will need to pay attention to each machine&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. Smaller machines tend to be weak to most elements, but tougher machines are sometimes highly resistant to certain elements; Stormbirds are resistant to Shock Damage, for example. To avoid wasting ammo, scan machines beforehand.
You can obtain the Lodge War Bow with 15 Blazing Sun marks from Hunting Grounds. However, the best War Bow in the game is the Banuk Champion Bow, available only in The Frozen Wilds DLC. This variant allows Aloy to overdraw shots for additional damage. However, it has to be bought with Bluegleam, a rare currency unique to the Frozen Wilds.





 4  Stormslinger 
A Specialized Shock Weapon From The Frozen Wilds
        

How To Get: 
Complete 
The Shaman&#39;s Path
 quest in 
Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds 
and speak to Ourea. 

A rare weapon belonging to the shamans of the Banuk, a tribe inhabiting the frozen north, the Stormslinger fires charged electric bolts that deal Shock Damage. It can fire multiple shots, each dealing increased damage, allowing Aloy to electrocute and shock most machines within a few seconds. The War Bow is still more versatile as it has multiple ammo types; however, the Stormslinger is the best weapon in the game for dealing Shock Damage.
Be careful not to fire the Stormslinger for too long, as it will eventually backfire and deal Shock Damage to Aloy. 

The basic Stormslinger is gifted to Aloy for free, but you can also get the Improved Stormslinger by bringing the weapon to the Oseram engineer Varga. Varga will offer to upgrade the weapon if Aloy brings her a special machine part by defeating a Stormbird.





 3  Icerail 
A Specialized Freeze Weapon From The Frozen Wilds
        

How To Get: 
Complete 
For The Werak
 in 
Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds 

Similar to the Stormslinger, the Icerail deals Freeze Damage and can freeze enemies solid with a spray of ice-cold Chillwater. There&#39;s arguably no better weapon for dealing Freeze Damage in Horizon Zero Dawn, and it&#39;s the perfect weapon for taking down machines that are vulnerable to Freeze, such as Scorchers and Fireclaws.
The Icerail is gifted to Aloy for free, just like the Stormslinger, and it can also be upgraded by bringing it to Varga. Varga will offer to upgrade the Icerail if Aloy helps her bring down a Thunderjaw for the right component. It&#39;s no small task, but in return, Varga will upgrade the Icerail so it can fire high-damage Ice Cannon ammo.





 2  Sharpshot Bow 
A High-Power, High Damage Ranged Weapon
        

How To Get: 
The Basic, Carja and Shadow Sharpshot Bow are all available from merchants. The Shadow Sharpshot Bow can be bought in Meridian for 800 Shards and 1 Sawtooth Heart. 

The Sharpshot Bow is a specialized bow in Horizon Zero Dawn with a low fire rate but extremely high-damage shots. With the Sharpshot Bow, Aloy can fire special Precision Arrows, which take longer to load and draw but deal a lot of additional damage. Human enemies are particularly weak to headshots from Precision Arrows and great for attacking weak points on machines.
Additional ammo types become available with upgraded variants. Tearblast Arrows are great for blasting off components and armor plating, while Harvest Arrows provide extra resources when used to tear off machine parts, perfect for grinding resources.
The best Sharpshot Bow variant in the game is the Banuk Powershot Bow. Like the Banuk Champion Bow, it has to be bought with Bluegleam and can be overdrawn to deal extra damage. Precision Arrows already deal incredible amounts of damage, so an overdrawn Banuk Powershot Bow is a good candidate for the strongest weapon in the game.
Along with Aloy&#39;s Shield Weaver Armor, the Banuk Powershot Bow is an essential part of Aloy&#39;s loadout in the late-game. 






 1  Hunter Bow 
An Essential Part Of Aloy&#39;s Arsenal


 







How To Get: 
The Carja Hunter Bow is automatically obtained at the start of the story. The Shadow Hunter Bow can be bought in Meridian for 650 Shards and 1 Watcher Heart. 

Aloy is incredibly skilled with a bow, and you should keep a variant of the Hunter Bow in your inventory throughout the game. The Shadow Hunter Bow fires basic arrows but allows Aloy to use Fire Arrows and Hardpoint Arrows. Hardpoint Arrows deal more damage than basic arrows but have a faster draw speed than Precision Arrows. As such, you can use them to bridge the gap between the Hunter Bow and the more powerful Sharpshot Bow.
With high-quality damage modifications, Hardpoint Arrows can deal almost as much damage as Precision Arrows but with a much faster draw. 

Like the War Bow and Sharpshot Bow, the Hunter Bow also has a Banuk variant: the Banuk Striker Bow. This can be overdrawn for extra damage, making it a fast and surprisingly powerful weapon.
Ultimately, although there are many powerful weapons in Horizon Zero Dawn, they all work best in concert. Having the best weapons in the game is important, but you&#39;ll also need to learn how to use them together, combining their effects to bring down your foes with ease.
