## Literature Review

With new remakes coming out for classic Mario RPGs, the future of the Paper Mario series could hold a return to the gameplay style of TTYD.




Although the popular Mario spinoff franchise, Paper Mario, has had a fair number of games that are divisive among its fans, the remakes of Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door may paint a promising picture for those who prefer the series&#39; classic style. Since The Thousand-Year Door, Paper Mario games have tended to stray from traditional RPG gameplay and story elements, beginning with the more platformer-like Super Paper Mario - and while the games haven&#39;t always had a completely negative reception, they have also left many longtime fans of the series wanting an experience more similar to the first few games.




While Super Mario RPG, the original Paper Mario, and TTYD all have their differences, the three games are all fairly traditional RPGs in terms of gameplay, with turn-based combat, selectable moves and items, and parties with colorful casts of characters. After TTYD, however, the series started to drastically diverge in terms of genre, with Super Paper Mario in particular resembling much more of a platformer with relatively minor RPG elements than the other way around. Later entries, Sticker Star and The Origami King, stuck closer to the series&#39; turn-based roots, but still featured major gameplay divergences - some of which, especially in Sticker Star, were particularly unpopular.

                  &#34;A Delightful Rendition of a Historic Treasure&#34;: Super Mario RPG Review   Super Mario RPG brings the fan-favorite classic back with welcome bells and whistles, inspiring players young and old to rediscover this Mario curio.

However, with the remake of Super Mario RPG /soon-to-be released, and the upcoming remake of The Thousand-Year Door slated for 2024, there&#39;s a fair chance that Nintendo may be gauging interest in a return to the series&#39; roots. While not all the series&#39; entries past TTYD have been poorly-received, all of them do stray away from the RPG systems and combat system of the more classic games, and arguably, no Paper Mario game since TTYD has reached the same height in terms of impact and reputation - especially in the case of Sticker Star, which was particularly poorly received among fans.

While Super Paper Mario and Origami King, on the other hand, have been better received as overall games than Sticker Star, all three share the same fundamental problem - as games in the Paper Mario franchise, they don&#39;t match the gameplay of the classic games. Super much more resembles a platformer, for example, and while Origami King does include turn-based combat, it&#39;s much closer to the style of a puzzle game than a traditional turn-based RPG with timed inputs. Of the three, Sticker Star&#39;s combat would actually be the closest, but it&#39;s hampered by the game&#39;s awkward sticker system, where limited inventory items are core to the combat.




Additionally, while the classic Mario RPG combat systems were simple on their surface, they did allow for a fair amount of depth when it came to customizing builds, arranging a party, and making decisions in-game, with extra-challenging content like TTYD&#39;s optional Pit of 100 Trials serving as a way to test a player&#39;s grasp of the systems like the game&#39;s badges and timed inputs. More recent games largely lack that sort of depth - while the Pit of 100 Trials made a return in Super Paper Mario, optional, challenging content to the same degree hasn&#39;t returned to the series since.

Aside from pure gameplay, however, more recent Paper Mario games also have something of a problem when it comes to their stories - or, more specifically, their characters. Whereas classic Mario RPGs like Super Mario RPG, Paper Mario, and TTYD all have memorable casts of characters, many of which are twists on traditional Mario enemies, Sticker Star and Origami King seemingly go out of their way to avoid ascribing unique visual traits to many of their characters - while Origami King&#39;s Bob-omb, &#34;Bobby&#34;, for example, is a character with a compelling storyline, he isn&#39;t as visually distinctive as characters like TTYD&#39;s Goombella or Admiral Bobbery, and doesn&#39;t have as unique of an identifying name.

 How The Mario RPG Remakes Could Influence The Next Paper Mario Game 
Super Mario RPG Remake Initial Release Date: November 17, 2023
         

Remakes of Super Mario RPG and Thousand-Year Door, however, could mark a sort of &#34;return to form&#34; for the series, as renewed interest in games that follow the more classic formula could influence the direction of the series&#39; future. This effect has already been seen in franchises like Fire Emblem, for example - when the series was suffering from low numbers leading up to the release of Fire Emblem: Awakening, that game&#39;s huge outburst of popularity greatly influenced the direction of the series going forward (for better or worse).




Similarly, although it&#39;s too early to tell if it will lead to more sequels, the success of games like Metroid: Samus Returns and Metroid Dread essentially served as a revival of 2D Metroid games, which hadn&#39;t received any new entries since Metroid Fusion in 2002. The massive success of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, as well, has practically guaranteed that future Zelda games will keep the open-world gameplay in some form, instead of reverting to the 3D formula that the Zelda games had held from Ocarina of Time until Skyward Sword.

The example of Metroid is especially pertinent, though - similarly to the remakes of Super Mario RPG and TTYD, Dread&#39;s development and release by developer Mercury Steam was sparked by the success of Samus Returns, a remake of one of the franchise&#39;s classic games. In a similar vein, although the remakes of Super Mario RPG and TTYD look to be less transformative than Samus Returns, they could still have a similar effect, kick-starting the development of an original new Paper Mario game that more closely emulates the style of the franchise&#39;s classic entries.




While the prospective new Paper Mario game likely won&#39;t be seen or announced for years to come, if in fact it does even happen, two remakes of classic Mario RPGs in relatively quick succession indicates at least some interest in bringing the series&#39; next entry closer to its RPG roots. While not every game after The Thousand-Year Door has been bad or poorly received, they undeniably don&#39;t function very well as sequels to the first two games, straying away from the RPG gameplay and increasing desires for a truer sequel. Hopefully, with the presumed success of the two remakes, Paper Mario&#39;s next game will follow more closely in the footsteps of the classics.
