## Literature Review

Beat Star Wars Jedi: Survivor? There is so much more to do when players cycle back around into New Journey &#43; mode. Here’s everything to know.




Once someone has beaten the main story campaign of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the fun doesn&#39;t have to end, as the adventure can then be played fresh with its version of New Game Plus, called New Journey &#43;. This mode gives more of a challenge for Cal and fun ways to experience the game differently with new perks, unlocks, and possibilities. The first time anyone plays through a game this detailed and large, it is natural that a lot of content could easily be missed out on, so having these incentives to go back and enjoy it again can be a good way to see more of the lore and story that might have passed players by originally.




Of course, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor can take around thirty hours to beat the game once, but for those who have enjoyed the experience and want to see what they missed or just try out different perks or lightsaber stances, going for a second or even third playthrough can be a tempting proposition. Many games offer an NG&#43; mode to keep the action going and encourage replayability, and Jedi: Survivor continues this tradition. In this game, they have titled NG&#43; to be New Journey &#43; to flow better with the initial Journey theme, and it provides players with several fun inducements to try it out.

                  Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Ending Explained (In Detail)   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#39;s final chapters are extremely tumultuous, putting Cal Kestis and the Stinger Mantis crew through their greatest test yet.   


 How To Start New Journey &#43; In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor 
NG&#43; Begins After Beating The Game On Any Difficulty
          




In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, players will automatically unlock the New Journey &#43; mode after successfully finishing the game on any of the difficulty settings. After the credits roll, the game shows players some brief explanations of what the new mode is and a bit about what they will get out of trying it out. Then, to start the more advanced NG&#43; playthrough, all players have to do is go back to the main menu screen and select &#34;Start New Journey &#43;&#34; from the listed options, and the adventure begins anew.

Cal&#39;s New Journey Can Begin With Refreshed Skills
         

Starting over isn&#39;t so bad when Cal gets to bring a lot of his stuff with him from the first time around. The New Journey &#43; mode makes the enemies a lot stronger, but it all evens out, given that Cal is also much stronger than he was initially. In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, players get to start the story over from the beginning while still having the skill points they earned in the first playthrough, and some new unlocks are provided.





 

Cal&#39;s skill points are refunded to him, letting players mix things up and try different arrangements than they had done in the previous run. This is a perfect opportunity to try different options and experiment with skills that didn&#39;t get much use before.

Because map upgrades carry over, it&#39;s a great idea to try to collect these in the first playthrough before beginning New Journey &#43;




New Journey &#43; in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a good time for players to try to find any collectibles they missed the first time playing the game. It is important to note that not only do all collectibles that have been found remain with Cal, but the chests will also remain open to quickly signal to the player which things have already been found to help them not waste too much time searching. Thanks to map upgrades carrying over, collectibles will be seen on the map from the beginning of New Journey &#43;.

 Every Perk Added For New Journey &#43; In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor 
Three Free Perks Are Unlocked
          




Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#39;s second playthrough in New Journey &#43; mode gives players three new perks: Purity, Warrior, and Trendsetter. These perks can be turned on or off in-game and include different bonuses. 

 Purity  Substantially increases weapon damage done by both friends and enemies.   Warrior  Standard enemy encounters are switched up with new, more challenging encounters.   Trendsetter  Cal&#39;s cosmetics are randomized at death.   



If players don&#39;t pay attention, they may be surprised by the challenge at the start of NG&#43;. The default settings for the New Journey &#43; have the Warrior Perk automatically equipped, which makes all the enemies significantly more difficult right from the start. This can be removed or changed at the first Meditation Circle that Cal finds on Coruscant, but until then, Cal may have a bit of a rude awakening, especially for anyone not aware of this. All other Perks, Stances, and Skills are automatically unequipped at the beginning of the NG&#43; and need to be selected anew at the Meditation Circle.






Abilities that are learned through story progression are not carried over.






 Cosmetic Unlocks For New Game &#43; In Jedi: Survivor 
New Journey &#43; Begins With The Party Blade Lightsaber
          

The party is just getting started in this NG&#43; option with the bonus lightsaber colors. As part of the bonuses, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor gives players a special Party Blade that cycles through rainbow colors when they start over. Also, for those who want to pretend they are Sith, a red blade option is now unlocked for Cal&#39;s lightsaber. All other lightsaber blades, as well as all cosmetics, carry over from the first playthrough to the next.

                  Wait, Does Cal Kestis Even Have A Canon Lightsaber Color?   Players can choose between a variety of lightsaber options in Respawn Entertainment&#39;s Star Wars: Jedi titles, but what&#39;s his canonical color?   






 What Does Not Carry Over In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor New Journey &#43; 
Force Powers Are Still Unlocked Through Story Progression
          

Because of the way the story campaign of the game is designed to progress, even though Cal starts New Journey &#43; with his skills and powers unlocked, players will still not have access to use all of his Force powers until they are unlocked during the natural progression of the narrative. While this can be disappointing, it makes sense or else it could cause some sequence-breaking issues in the story advancement if Cal already has each ability.

Many video games recently have been adding NG&#43; modes as an option to help encourage players in their replayability. This game&#39;s predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, did not offer a NG&#43; mode until about six months after it was released. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has it available for everyone who has enjoyed their first run of the game and now wants to go back and take their time getting all the collectibles and seeing anything they missed originally.
