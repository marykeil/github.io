# 7 Assassin s Creed Games With The Best Modern-Day Stories


## SUMMARY 


 The 
Assassin&#39;s Creed

 While most

 games focus on the past, some titles feature more narrative about the Animus and the current day. 
 The story in games like

lends itself perfectly to these concepts.

## Literature Review

Assassin&#39;s Creed&#39;s modern-day stories aren&#39;t necessarily what the series is known for, but the better ones have some interesting elements.




The Assassin&#39;s Creed series is well-known for its historical settings and stories, but the modern-day narratives that have typically played a supporting role are also a crucial part of the franchise&#39;s identity. From the very first game, Assassin&#39;s Creed has taken the interesting tack of justifying in-game mechanics and UI through the concept of the Animus, a virtual construct that allows modern-day characters to explore past identities and adventures. The recent title Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage skipped out on the tradition, but Assassin&#39;s Creed Nexus VR stuck to the formula and made some interesting use of the VR headset.
While even the weakest historical stories in Assassin&#39;s Creed still offer interesting sights to see and characters to meet, the modern-day entries have more of an uphill battle to attract interest. Assassin&#39;s Creed Animus users don&#39;t tend to have the honed skills of ancestral Assassins, and the more minor presence in the overall runtime gives them less room to develop complexities. Even so, the series has managed to score some hits, with the best modern-day stories standing head-and-shoulders above the ones that never justify themselves as anything more than filler.

 7  Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag Changes The Game 
Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U
        

Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag took on the unenviable task of moving the modern-day story past Desmond, and it didn&#39;t fully succeed in delivering a comparable replacement. To its credit, however, it did try some entirely new ideas, with a new angle on Abstergo and a bit more meta-commentary on Ubisoft itself, providing a substantially different overall feel. It&#39;s easy to blame Black Flag for the sidelining of modern-day stories in subsequent games, but its willingness to try something new has to be worth something.





 6  Assassin&#39;s Creed Nexus VR Is Perfect For The Animus 
Platforms: Meta Quest 2, 3, Pro
        

Assassin&#39;s Creed Nexus VR isn&#39;t necessarily an obvious choice for one of the better modern-day storylines, as the actual plot isn&#39;t much more than a framework for the segmented mission structure. There&#39;s also no real gameplay outside the Animus, with a few basic grid-based puzzles providing the only notable diversion. The big difference, however, is the VR format, which taps into the idea of the Animus in a way that the series has always begged for. A few cool moments play with that concept in a way that&#39;s more memorable than most modern-day Assassin&#39;s Creed material, with an especially memorable ending sending things off on a high note.





 5  Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla Rights The Ship 
Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, PC
        

The modern-day stories of Assassin&#39;s Creed have mostly been frustrating since the conclusion of Desmond&#39;s original story arc, bouncing around between half-formed ideas and generally taking on a sidelined role. Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla actually feels like something of a return to form, focusing on interesting characters and advancing the plot instead of spinning its wheels. The ending was especially exciting, shaking things up in an energizing way, although whether Ubisoft capitalizes on that momentum in the long run remains to be seen.

 4  Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 Is Classic 
Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS3, Xbox 360


 







Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 is a towering triumph for the series in general, but the modern-day parts are more good than great. They still come in well above the franchise&#39;s batting average, and the game codified a lot of ideas that became standards for the out-of-Animus story and gameplay in future titles. Any skills Desmond got to put to use in Brotherhood, Revelations, and Assasin&#39;s Creed 3 were the results of his training in the first outing of the Assassin&#39;s Creed Ezio trilogy. Most importantly, it ends with a big reveal immediately followed by a line that encapsulates all of Desmond&#39;s goofy charm, passing the torch on a high note.





 3  Assassin&#39;s Creed Lays The Groundwork 
Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360
        

The modern-day segments of the original Assassin&#39;s Creed 1 aren&#39;t always fondly remembered, mostly because the gameplay tends to be slow and clunky. On the story end, however, Assassin&#39;s Creed had an atmosphere and element of mystery that the series has never fully recaptured, and that makes it stand out even today among a lot of other stories that tend to blend into each other. It also incorporated the idea of the Animus into the game design more thoroughly than future entries, which makes it a fascinating object to study in terms of its use of the medium.





 2  Assassin&#39;s Creed Brotherhood Refines The Modern Day 
Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS3, Xbox 360
        

Following up on Assassin&#39;s Creed 2, Assassin&#39;s Creed Brotherhood had to deal with some sky-high expectations, but it managed them quite well by refining plenty of ideas from its predecessor and maintaining most of what made it beloved. If any area sees a particularly big leap, it&#39;s the modern-day story. Visiting the modern-day version of Monteriggioni was a special highlight, and adding more mechanics made things more compelling in terms of gameplay.





 1  Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 Is A Major Conclusion 
Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U


 







Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 was a fairly divisive entry overall, but the mixed response wasn&#39;t focused on the modern-day story. As the grand finale for Desmond&#39;s narrative that had been building throughout the series to that point, the B-plot felt genuinely climactic in a way that the franchise has never quite replicated. The execution ultimately isn&#39;t perfect — the tangle of ideas presented in prior games doesn&#39;t see anything approaching a full resolution — but a flawed realization of some serious ambition ultimately results in something that&#39;s more memorable than any of its predecessors or successors.
            
 
 Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 Has One Of Gaming&#39;s Best Ever Openings 
Assassin&#39;s Creed 3 may be one of the most controversial games in the series, but its opening act started the game with an unforgettable bang.



When it comes to gameplay, Desmond received a more active role than ever before, showing off the results of his training in prior games by taking on some actual missions and putting skills to the test. For the first time, there were major set pieces in this part of the game, including a big skyscraper sequence with vaguely blockbuster aspirations. Most importantly, the emotional stakes were higher than ever before, giving the best modern-day Assassin&#39;s Creed plot some real pathos that remains memorable over a decade later.
