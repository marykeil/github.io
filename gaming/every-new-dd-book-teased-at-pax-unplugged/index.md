## Literature Review

Dungeons &amp; Dragons has a big year planned for 2024, and some key reveals from PAX Unplugged offer a glimpse at core rulebooks, adventures, and more.




2024 is set to be a big year for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and a new PAX Unplugged panel in honor of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the game offered a sneak peek at some books that will be coming out soon. With the imminent introduction of One D&amp;D, the newest iteration of DnD that will be backward compatible with the current fifth edition, the coming year will be a transitional period for material released for the game. Getting a glimpse of what&#39;s ahead is helpful for DMs and players who want to stay abreast of changes or anyone interested in jumping in for the first time.




Recent months have already been busy for DnD releases, with a steady release of one major book per month from August through November. Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk expanded the original 5e starter adventure into a full campaign, Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants and The Book of Many Things focused on adding new options and information to the game, and Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse finally brought 5e to the Planescape setting. It looks like 2024 may be something of a cooldown period, but it shouldn&#39;t be too long before the ball starts rolling again.

                  D&amp;D&#39;s Planescape Character Options: The New Backgrounds &amp; Feats Explained   So you want your new character for D&amp;D’s Planescape setting to fit into the surrounding world? Here are the new feats and backgrounds to do just that.   


 New One D&amp;D Player&#39;s Handbook &amp; Core Rulebooks 
         




Perhaps the biggest reveal from the PAX Unplugged panel, available from the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons YouTube account, is a first look at the upcoming edition of the Player&#39;s Handbook. As the main source of information about how to play DnD and the options available for building characters and taking on adventures, the Player&#39;s Handbook is the closest thing to a single must-have title for anyone at the game table. The big promise of the panel is that it will be the &#34;biggest Player&#39;s Handbook that D&amp;D has ever had,&#34; both in terms of page count and general content included.

The new Player&#39;s Handbook will feature 48 subclasses, with each one receiving unique art for the first time. This focus on illustrations apparently continues throughout the book. A new emphasis on backgrounds with unique feats is also reflected through an extensive section with an illustration for each, and every weapon gets unique artwork to create the sense of a proper fantasy item catalog. Although overall information on the book is still limited, more is promised to come throughout panels and videos in the months ahead. The Player&#39;s Handbook is planned for a 2024 release.




                  D&amp;D Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants - Every New Subclass, Background, &amp; Feat   Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants introduces a number of new character options to Dungeons &amp; Dragons that can connect any player to giant lore.   

The team is also making big promises for the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide and Monster Manual. For the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide, a big focus is on reorganization in favor of accessibility, as well as the inclusion of a full setting and some adventures, a selection of new magic items, and more. Like the Player&#39;s Handbook, the new Monster Manual will be the biggest that DnD has released yet. The most exciting improvement is the plan to revamp monsters and ensure that each foe has something unique in gameplay, addressing a long-standing issue of repetitive mechanics in the 5e Monster Manual, as well as more high-level monsters than before.



 Vecna: Eve of Ruin Is A New D&amp;D Adventure Campaign 
          




Vecna: Eve of Ruin is also set to release in 2024, kicking off One D&amp;D with a full adventure campaign focusing on an iconic villain. This story is being billed as something of an anniversary celebration, featuring major elements from across DnD history that extend beyond familiar 5e characters and places. Vecna&#39;s attempt to control the entire multiverse should come into play in the narrative, as, in the general vogue of a variety of currently popular media, a multiversal adventure for the party is promised.

Vecna has gotten a boost in name recognition in the past few years thanks to Stranger Things, but the actual DnD character of Vecna is a particularly powerful foe in his own right. As an evil lich that became a god, Vecna has a storied history including more than one death and some time-traveling shenanigans. The villain didn&#39;t make any major appearance in DnD 5e outside his involvement in the first campaign of Critical Role, so Vecna: Eve of Ruin is a way to reintroduce the character with the style that he&#39;s earned many times over.






 Quests From The Infinite Staircase &amp; More In 2024 
          

Quests from the Infinite Staircase follows the overall idea of the DnD 5e book Tales from the Yawning Portal, lining up a selection of past DnD adventures for a modern anthology. The adventures are obviously updated to fit within the modern system, and linking elements make it possible to run the adventures together as a campaign or use them individually.  The book uses the titular staircase and a mysterious &#34;cosmic being&#34; that&#39;s being introduced to DnD canon for the first time, although his full nature may not be clear until Quests from the Infinite Staircase releases sometime in 2024.

                  &#34;Impressively Like D&amp;D&#34; - MInecraft x Dungeons &amp; Dragons Review   Minecraft x Dungeons &amp; Dragons from Everbloom Games is a dungeon-crawling adventure through the Forgotten Realms that feels impressively like D&amp;D.   




For those interested in DnD history, The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons: 1970-1976 is a book focusing on the creation of the first edition of DnD that will release in 2024. It provides a page-for-page replica of the original game, correspondence involving its creation, and commentary providing a historical retrospective, adding up to a 500&#43; page volume overall. Considering the date range given in the title, it seems possible that it could be the start of a series going throughout the history of the game, although no announcement regarding future books has been made.

Although the PAX Unplugged panel kept its coverage of each upcoming DnD title brief, it&#39;s nice to finally get some hard information on things that have been mostly speculation so far. The new Player&#39;s Handbook stole the show as the primary signpost for DnD&#39;s future, but new adventures and even the Making Of book are also nice additions to the 2024 catalog. Coming off of a year that was filled with books, a major video game release, and a theatrical film, Dungeons &amp; Dragons is maintaining its momentum in 2024 and hopefully beyond.
