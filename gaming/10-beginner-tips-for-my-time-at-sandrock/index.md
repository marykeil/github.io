## Literature Review

My Time At Sandrock is a fun life sim but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s always easy. Starting strong is vital to making consistent progress in the game.





Though there are many ways to spend the day, there are several tasks that should be completed consistently, such as building up supplies or advancing romantic relationships in My Time At Sandrock. There seems to be an endless list of things to be done and days never feel long enough. There are several tips to consider when first starting that make a day feel plenty long enough









 








 10  Always Have Water 
Purchase Water &amp; Utilize Dew Collectors
        

As one might guess, My Time At Sandrock revolves around farming, and thus, the primary things needed will be crops, fertilizer, and water. Water is perhaps the most vital element in the entire game and something many will run out of quickly if they don&#39;t keep a steady supply.
Though it is possible to acquire water without buying it, it&#39;s most likely that players will need to do both. Try to get as much as you can through your own methods, but don&#39;t make the mistake of not purchasing any either.
Buy out the stock, but don&#39;t overbuy. The price will increase once the stock is bought, so wait for it to reset to purchase more. 






 9  Stock Up &amp; Stay Working 
There Is No Such Thing As Too Many Resources
        

While water is a large priority and something players will need to purchase and acquire on their own, there are plenty of other things that are important as well. Even if it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s a need for anything specific at the moment, do it anyway, because while it may not be something that&#39;s needed right now, it may be something you need later, and it&#39;s always better to have a supply ready.
There should never be a point where players are not actively working on anything, even if it&#39;s just working on relationships in My Time At Sandrock instead of supplies.





 8  Don&#39;t Buy What Can Be Made 
Only Purchase Items That Can&#39;t Be Acquired Elsewhere


 







While it may be tempting to purchase things to save time or avoid having to do it, it&#39;s a waste of money. For this reason, always double-check item descriptions when able and verify that this item can only be purchased before spending any My Time At Sandrock Gols on it.
For example, salt is something that can only be purchased, so buying it is fine. However, something like wooden chests can be made and, therefore, it would be a waste to purchase. The only exception to this would be if a specific thing was needed immediately for one reason or another.





 7  Get Chests From The Mysterious Man 
Save Up Gols For The Mysterious Man When He Visits
        

Since this is a sequel to My Time At Portia, players may recognize a familiar face, the Mysterious Man. Like in Portia, he will only visit Sandrock on specific days of the season. Currently, his schedule is that he will appear on the 20th and 21st days of each season to sell rare items to locals.
Though it&#39;s advised against purchasing chests elsewhere, the Mysterious Man is one that an exception should be made for. His items are always worth purchasing, so be sure to anticipate his visits and save up some Gols. Players can usually purchase up to 2 chests per one of the Mysterious Man&#39;s visits.





 6  Check The Calendar 
Stay Updated On Events &amp; Make Custom Reminders


 







The Mysterious Man isn&#39;t the only thing happening on a schedule in Sandrock. In fact, many things are going on that are time-specific and can be referenced by referring to the calendar. The calendar can help players stay aware of events happening that they may want to keep an eye out for.
However, not everything will always be marked. For example, Firesight events happen every Sunday, but typically players will receive a letter in the mail if something very significant is happening they won&#39;t want to miss.





 5  Start Small 
Don&#39;t Overextend Too Early, Build The Farm Gradually
        

While it may be tempting to go big and bold as fast as possible when it comes to farming, this is not a good idea. Farming requires a lot of work and supplies to do it successfully. Trying to create a large crop too early will result in not having enough water or fertilizer to have it be of any benefit.
The better option is to start small, with something like a 4x4, and tend to that. Once you have developed a method for gaining a steady supply of water and fertilizer, then look into growing the farm, but do so slowly to ensure that you do not take on more than you can handle.





 4  Check Quests Frequently 
Don&#39;t Lose Track of Time-Sensitive Quests
        

With so much to do, it can be easy to get distracted and start focusing on other things, which is typically fine. However, there will be some things that require completion at a deadline and these should not be ignored. Mainline story quests will always be marked yellow, while side quests are marked blue.
Be sure to check the quest log when receiving a new one to ensure that there is no time limit on it. If there is, make sure it is done as soon as possible, so it is not forgotten. Commissions should be completed on the same day to result in the most reward.





 3  Sell In The Highs, Buy In The Lows 
Watch The Fluctuating Market Prices


 







As expected, market prices will occasionally fluctuate in My Time At Sandrock. Therefore, there should be a slight strategy when it comes to buying that&#39;s not too dissimilar from how people recommend buying stocks. Essentially, players will want to try to focus on their buying when the market is low, meaning don&#39;t buy things if they have got a &gt;5% increase in their market price. However, while this is not a good time for buying, it is a great time for selling.
Since high market prices apply to anything you sell as well, this is when you&#39;ll be able to get the most out of your goods, so try to wait for high market increases before selling.
Buy when the market is low and sell when the market is high. An ideal selling point will be when the market has reached at least a 10% increase, but anything is still better than nothing. Try to avoid selling when it&#39;s low, unless necessary. 






 2  Use Up All Stamina 
Be Productive, But Don&#39;t Forget To Rest
        

Stamina is a vital feature in My Time At Sandrock as this is how things get done every day. Whenever possible, players should work on increasing their stamina through spending some knowledge points, so that they have more to take advantage of. With something so valuable, it&#39;s important not to waste it.
Since stamina replenishes fully with a good night&#39;s rest, use up every last bit of it before hitting the bed. Even if it&#39;s just something small, try not to let any of it be wasted. However, keep in mind that a full night&#39;s rest is vital too. Be sure to get to bed before midnight to get the Well-Rested status and replenish stamina fully.
Going to bed after midnight but before 3 am will likely result in not being fully replenished. Going to bed after 3 am will result in passing out from exhaustion. So don&#39;t take this tip lightly, get to bed on time. 






 1  Make The Day Longer. Literally. 
Change Settings To Make Time Pass Slowly
        

While it is important to make the most out of a day in My Time At Sandrock, there is a way to literally make the day longer and cause time to pass more slowly. Head into the options menu and look for the Game Speed setting. Though it can be set faster, that is generally not a good idea unless you want to lose time. However, setting it to 0.5 will essentially double the length of the day.
Though this may not seem like a big deal, time is a big constraint in My Time At Sandrock, especially with a midnight bedtime, so doing this can allow more things to be accomplished before ending the day.
