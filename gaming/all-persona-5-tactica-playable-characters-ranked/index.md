## Literature Review

There are eight playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here’s how they compare to each other.




The playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica vary in terms of effectiveness. They&#39;re not unlike their Persona 5 Royal counterparts in that way, but there are some significant differences. In the original Persona 5 and its rerelease, a character&#39;s viability was determined by their base stats, strengths, weaknesses, and Persona skills. While all of that does factor into Persona 5 Tactica&#39;s character rankings, there are a few new mechanics to consider.
P5T includes a variety of new skills to suit the shift in genre from RPG to turn-based strategy. Each character also comes with a unique, whole-party buff that&#39;s applied whenever they&#39;re placed on the battlefield. Persona spells are less about dealing elemental damage (although they still do plenty of that), and more about applying status effects or repositioning enemies. And, to top it all off, there&#39;s a brand-new playable character, with her own distinct traits. Here are all eight playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica, ranked by how handy they are in a fight.

Persona 5 Tactica strikes a balance between XCOM-style tactical gameplay and the cozy, social dynamics of P5, making for a fun journey.












 








 8  Erina 
The Persona-less, Premiering Protagonist
        

Erina (Elle in the Japanese version) is P5T’s newest arrival, and mainly exists to introduce new players to the basic mechanics of the game. She has half-decent base stats, especially in attack damage, but poor movement and an incredibly low range. As a result, she&#39;s only useful when other characters create an opening for her. But her greatest weakness is that Erina can&#39;t summon a Persona. She may not be totally useless, but without the myriad benefits of Persona skills, she lags far behind all the other playable characters.





 7  Haru 
And Milady
        

Haru is a recurring character from the original Persona 5, best known for her high-damage rocket launcher and psychic-type Persona Milady. Both of those recur in Persona 5 Tactica, and with its more gun-focused gameplay, she can inflict severe punishment on enemy groups. However, Milady&#39;s Psio skills aren&#39;t quite as useful as some of the other in-game elements. They can pull foes out of cover, which may be useful in certain situations, but other Personas&#39; skills are more applicable in a wide variety of scenarios.





 6  Morgana 
And Zorro
        

Morgana has become something of a series mascot since his introduction in Persona 5, and reappears in a similar role here. In Tactica, he&#39;s exceptionally light on his paws, scampering across the battlefield with some of the highest movement speeds in the game. His gun and wind-elemental damage are fine, and his Garu skills have the added benefit of shoving their targets back. Again, that&#39;s only effective situationally, especially when getting enemies down from high ground, but beyond that, it has limited use. However, it&#39;s easy for Morgana to take advantage of those same positional bonuses with his high movement stats.

 5  Joker 
And Arsene


 







Joker is the original protagonist of Persona 5, and as his name implies, he&#39;s a wild card, able to take on multiple Personas at once. However, Persona 5 Tactica does away with that ability, instead allowing each Persona user to equip a second, Sub-Persona in addition to their default one.
As a result, Joker no longer has a distinct advantage over his fellow Phantom Thieves. His base stats almost make up for it, and his special attack Phantom Judge does have a particularly long range, making him a powerful ally wherever he&#39;s positioned. Surprisingly, P5T turns Joker into more of a support character with defense-raising skills like Rakukaja. He may not be as much of a front-liner, but he&#39;s definitely a good team player.





 4  Yusuke 
And Goemon
        

Yusuke is another recurring character from Persona 5. His gun skills translate well to Persona 5 Tactica, as they&#39;re able to chunk off large segments of enemy HP bars even at range. However, they&#39;re less effective against multiple targets. What does make Yusuke one of the best playable characters in P5T is his access to ice-elemental Bufu skills. In Tactica, these have the potential to freeze enemies in place, lowering their movement speed and potentially preventing them from getting back under cover. He also has a special skill called Like a Phantom, which lets him create decoys that may force foes to waste their turns.







 3  Ryuji 
And Captain Kidd
        

Ryuji rounds out the top three playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica, simply due to the stunning amount of sheer physical damage he can inflict. Even better, Ryuji specializes in shotguns, which means he can hit multiple targets at once. His lightning-elemental skills are just fine, but more importantly, his special move Brigantine Blitzkrieg can stop enemy movement completely. This can open up opportunities for his teammates in Persona 5 Tactica to land Triple Threat Attacks, which are effectively equivalent to the original Persona 5&#39;s All-Out Attacks.





 2  Makoto 
And Johanna
        

One of the best characters in Persona 5 also happens to be one of the best in Tactica: Makoto Nijima and her Persona, the sentient motorcycle Johanna. Makoto is mostly melee-focused in P5T, but that&#39;s fine - get her close enough to an enemy, and the damage she&#39;ll do will more than make up for the risk of getting there.
Makoto also has a special AoE attack called Full Throttle, in which she revs up her engine and charges directly forward in a straight line, knocking back anyone in her path. This can be excellent for breaking up big groups, or just doing a ton of damage at once. She&#39;s also great as a support character, with access to whole-party healing skills like Media and Mediarama.





 1  Ann 
And Carmen


 







Just as Ryuji&#39;s shotgun skills propel him into the top three, Ann&#39;s whopping Persona skill damage makes her the best playable character in Persona 5 Tactica. Carmen is a fire-elemental Persona, able to burn enemies to a crisp in a single turn. Ann also has access to the Tarukaja suite of buffs, which can raise one ally&#39;s or the entire party&#39;s attack depending on the version cast. And she doesn&#39;t have to waste a whole round to do so - Ann can use Femme Fatale to take a second action in a single turn.
Ann also has the best passive bonus in the game, naturally raising the entire party&#39;s SP. SP is the sole resource used for casting spells and skills in Persona 5 Tactica, which means everyone will stay fighting fit longer with Ann in the party. All in all, she&#39;s an indispensable ally in any fight.
Some characters are certainly better than others, but each of them really does have their own little niche. Sure, party composition is important, but there&#39;s still no such thing as a completely useless character in P5T. Rather than always striving to include the &#34;best&#34; possible characters in a single, fixed party, it&#39;s best to experiment with different members&#39; strengths. The true key to victory in Persona 5 Tactica isn&#39;t just having the best characters available - it&#39;s knowing how to read a situation, and swapping in whoever&#39;s best suited to overcome it.
