## Literature Review

To unlock and then find Solgaleo’s location in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you will first need to complete a few tasks in the Indigo Disk DLC.





The creature is one of the many Legendary Pokémon from previous titles that made their way into the Gen 9 games (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet). Like all of these Legendary monsters, there is a specific set of tasks to unlock Solgaleo’s encounter. After that, you will need to find its exact (and fixed) spawning location in Paldea. Luckily, that is not too hard to do. The primary prerequisite is that you finish the Indigo Disk DLC campaign.




                  Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests   In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.

Once you have concluded The Indigo Disk, you will unlock an NPC called Snacksworth at Blueberry Academy’s entrance. In Pokémon Scarlet, you will need to complete 10 Solo Blueberry Quests (BBQs), and in Pokémon Violet, you will need to complete 1 Group BBQ via the Union Circle to get a chance at obtaining a special Key Item. Upon completing the task, Snacksworth may grant you the Key Item you need to unlock the encounter with the Legendary Pokémon: a Solgaleo Treat. Snacksworth is responsible for all Legendaries, and the Treat he gives out with each task completion is randomized.






You may not get Solgaleo Treat during your first few attempts. Continue completing the BBQs according to your version of the Gen 9 games and return to Snacksworth for a chance to obtain Solgaleo Treat.






 Solgaleo’s Location In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC 
          

After you have unlocked the encounter by obtaining Solgaleo Treat, you can head out to find Solgaleo’s location in Paldea. As with the other Legendaries in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, this creature has a fixed spawning location. Solgaleo’s location in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is at the top of the Pokémon League building, west of Mesagoza. For further reference, Solgaleo is not on the uppermost platform where you beat Champion Geeta in the base game’s campaign, but on the larger level below.






Disable auto-save and manually save your game before starting your encounter with Solgaleo. This way, you can hard reset the game if Solgaleo gets knocked out.




If you are not using a Master Ball to ensure its capture without a battle or trying a Quick Ball to get a shot at a capture during the first round, you will have to lower Solgaleo’s HP to increase your chances of making the catch. This, however, comes with a risk. Solgaleo has two self-damaging moves in its kit, which can cause it to be knocked out. As such, you must be careful when lowering its HP and maybe even avoid super-effective moves in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet altogether.



Instead of getting Solgaleo’s HP to the red zone, you may have a better chance of lowering it to the yellow zone and then start showering Ultra Balls on it. Its self-damaging moves should get its HP to the red zone eventually.




If the battle is going on for several rounds, you can use Timer Balls to have a better chance at capturing Solgaleo. Among the returning Legendaries in Gen 9’s Indigo Disk DLC, Solgaleo may be one of the most complicated ones to catch, mainly due to its self-damaging moves. Regardless, this is one of the best Legendaries in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, so it is well worth the effort.
