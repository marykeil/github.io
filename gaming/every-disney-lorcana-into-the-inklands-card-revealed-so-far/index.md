 Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards 
Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands is the third set for the TCG, arriving early next year with new location cards and fan-favorite characters.












 








 23  Stitch - Rock Star #30/P1 
Enchanted Card For Championship Event Rewards


 







The Stitch - Rock Star card from Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter is making a return in a new enchanted promo card that will only be available as a reward for the top 4 players in any approved Disney Lorcana TCG Organized Play event. The top two players at the events will also receive a Champion playmat with the image of the card.





 22  Distract #159/204 
Sapphire Ink Action
        

Action cards in Disney Lorcana can be useful strategies, and the new Distract card will be helpful when playing defense. Using this two-ink action, the player can choose a character to have two less attack strength for the turn.





 21  Heal What Has Been Hurt #26/204 
Amber Ink Action Song


 







As its name implies, the Song card Heal What Has Been Hurt provides a healing benefit. The song can be sung by a character to remove up to three damage from one character and then allows the player to also draw a card.
            
 
 Every Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Enchanted Card (&amp; How Much They&#39;re Worth) 
Enchanted cards are the cream of the crop in Disney Lorcana, and Rise of the Floodborn introduces a whole new batch of serious power players.








 20  I&#39;ve Got A Dream #129/204 
Ruby Ink Action Song
        

Another Song card from Disney&#39;s Tangled, I&#39;ve Got A Dream relates to the new Location mechanic being introduced in Into The Inklands by letting a character at a location become readied. They will not be able to quest that turn, but by being in the readied position, they are protected from opponent challenges.





 19  The Sorcerer&#39;s Hat #65/204 
Amethyst Ink Item
        

Unlike Actions that are played and discarded, an Item card can remain in play until something banishes it. The Sorcerer&#39;s Hat will allow players to use one ink to name a card and test their luck to see if the card on the top of the deck is what they named. If it is, they can put the card into their hand. There is quite a bit of gambling done for this to work well, but, when successful, could be useful in building up a hand.





 18  Piglet - Pooh Pirate Captain #16/204 
Amber Ink Dreamborn
        

Winnie the Pooh characters are always exciting to see in Disney Lorcana, and this adorable rendering of Piglet - Pooh Pirate Captain is already gaining the attention of many. Not only does it feature cute artwork, but as long as two or more other characters are in play, Piglet will gain two extra lore when questing.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana Cards - Rarity, Types, Ink, Glimmers, &amp; Lore 
Disney Lorcana is designed as a simple deck-builder for all to enjoy, but it also offers depth in available strategies and an engaging story as well.








 17  Dalmatian Puppy - Tail Wagger #4/204 
Amber Ink Storyborn


 







Interestingly, there are many different varieties of the Dalmatian Puppies card, and they introduce an interesting new game mechanic. While the rules for Disney Lorcana limit a player to only having up to four of one card in their deck, with the Dalmatian Puppies they are allowed up to 99 of the card. This could make for some truly massive decks, but an interesting, and entertaining, game.





 16  Pongo - Determined Father #19/204 
Amber Ink Storyborn
        

Pongo - Determined Father is one of the cards that can be used to create a Dalmatian-heavy deck. This card has a cost of three ink to play and allows the player to pay two ink to reveal the top card on the deck and put it into their hand if it is a character card or move it to the bottom of their deck if not, once per turn.





 15  Mama Odie - Voice Of Wisdom #52/204 
Amethyst Ink Dreamborn


 







Mama Odie&#39;s magical voodoo abilities in Disney&#39;s The Princess and the Frog are brought into Lorcana: Into the Inklands with Mama Odie - Voice of Wisdom. This useful card will give two lore when questing, and every time she quests, two damage counters from one character can be moved to an opposing character instead, therefore giving the player lore, healing, and damaging the opponent in one move.





 14  Flotsam - Riffraff #72/204 &amp; Jetsam - Riffraff #76/204 
Emerald Ink Dreamborns
        

Flotsam and Jetsam are no strangers to the Disney Lorcana world, also having Amethyst Ink cards that appeared in The First Chapter set. As was the case in their original debut, these two new cards are designed to work together, granting one another buffs such as increased attack power and the Ward buff.





 13  Peter Pan - Lost Boy Leader #82/204 
Emerald Ink Dreamborn
        

In addition to stunning artwork, Peter Pan - Lost Boy Leader makes use of the new Location cards in Disney Lorcana. As Peter Pan moves to a location, he will gain lore equal to that location&#39;s amount of lore.





 12  Ursula - Deceiver #90/204 
Emerald Ink Storyborn
        

Ursula - Deceiver is truly playing to her villainous strengths and would be very useful when playing against an opponent who uses songs regularly. When Ursula is played, an opponent must reveal their hand and discard a Song card of the Ursula player&#39;s choice.





 11  Stitch - Covert Agent 
Emerald Ink Dreamborn


 







Stitch is easily one of the most-seen characters in the Disney Lorcana world now, with several cards in every set featuring him. This Stitch - Covert Agent card has some of the card hidden in the revealed image (via Mushu Report), but is an Evasive character. Using one of the new Location abilities, he will gain Ward when placed in a Location, which will protect him from actions other than challenges.





 10  Stitch - Little Rocket #125/204 
Ruby Ink Dreamborn
        

Yes, another Stitch is being revealed for Disney Lorcana. The adorable little &#34;dog&#34; has had many cards in the game now, and seems to be the most infamous character in the world of glimmers. Along with his Emerald ink Stitch - Covert Agent card shown above, he is shown here as Stitch - Little Rocket. Costing only two ink (but not being able to become ink), this card has the benefit of having Rush to challenge as soon as they are played to the board.





 9  Jim Hawkins - Space Traveler #109/204 
Ruby Ink Storyborn
        

Sure to be a favored card for many, Jim Hawkins - Space Traveler has four defense, four offense, and can collect two lore when questing. When Jim Hawkins is first played, any one Location card in the player&#39;s hand that costs four or less can be played for free.





 8  Moana - Born Leader #116/204 
Ruby Ink Floodborn


 







Despite appearing as a featured character in The First Chapter starter decks, Moana has made relatively few appearances in the game, often being overshadowed by Maui. Lorcana: Into the Inklands will feature the new Moana - Born Leader on a playmat and one of the announced new Location cards will be Motunui. This Moana card will include an ability where when she quests while at a Location, all other characters there will be readied but cannot quest for that turn.





 7  Scrooge McDuck - Richest Duck In The World #154/204 
Sapphire Ink Storyborn
        

Scrooge McDuck - Richest Duck In The World is an exciting addition to the Into the Inklands lineup. Not only does Scrooge have the Evasive ability, but when he successfully banishes another character in a challenge, an item can be played for free. As the Sapphire ink deck is heavy in items, this is a valuable addition to this ink deck in particular.





 6  Wendy Darling - Authority On Peter Pan #158/204 
Sapphire Ink Storyborn
        

Wendy Darling - Authority on Peter Pan is a good support character to have. She can quest for three lore, and when she quests, her attack strength of three can be added to another character&#39;s strength for that turn. She is also protected from songs, items, and actions hurting her thanks to the Ward ability.





 5  Tinker Bell - Very Clever Fairy 
Sapphire Ink Dreamborn
        

The Disney Lorcana: Into the Inklands card Tinker Bell - Very Clever Fairy is indeed clever, and a strong addition. As she is in play, whenever the player has one of their item cards banished, it can be placed into their inkwell rather than discarded. Again, with the amount of items used in the Sapphire deck, this is a handy strength to have.





 4  Eeyore - Overstuffed Donkey #172/204 
Steel Ink Storyborn


 







Another fan-favorite from the Winnie the Pooh series, Eeyore has been a desired card for a long time. Eeyore - Overstuffed Donkey is a strong card with five defense and the Resist ability, which means that each time damage is done to Eeyore, it is reduced by one. Plus, it looks absolutely charming with the beautiful card illustrations.
