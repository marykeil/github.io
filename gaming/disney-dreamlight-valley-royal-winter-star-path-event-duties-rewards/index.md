                  Disney Dreamlight Valley: Best Things To Do After Completing All Story Quests   Though story quests may be done for now, there is still plenty to do in Disney Dreamlight Valley such as friendships, gardening, and saving money.   

The final bonus reward on page seven of the Event Rewards is 90 Moonstones for 10 Tokens. This is repeatable, so any additional Tokens earned through completing Event Duties can be used to acquire extra Moonstones. Once everything has been earned, all that is left is to wait for the next Seasonal Event in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
