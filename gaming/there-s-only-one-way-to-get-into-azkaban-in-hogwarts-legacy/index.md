## SUMMARY 



  Visiting Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy is exclusive to only one house.   Inside Azkaban, players are met with Dementors and must help a wrongfully imprisoned individual while facing intense moments.   After visiting Azkaban, players cannot go back, but it&#39;s still possible future DLC might expand the quest for other Hogwarts houses.

## Literature Review

It&#39;s possible to go to Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy, but some preliminary steps are required in order to visit this iconic Harry Potter location.




Hogwarts Legacy contains an abundance of locations and secrets to explore, but if players are interested in visiting Azkaban, they&#39;ll need to follow a couple of steps to get there. Despite being one of the most memorable places from Harry Potter, it can only be accessed by a specific group of students. In fact, a certain irreversible decision can bar players from getting into Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy entirely, so it&#39;s crucial that they know which choices to make early on.




Throughout Harry Potter history, Azkaban has housed some of the wizarding world&#39;s most dangerous dark witches and wizards, such as Bellatrix Lestrange and Bartemius Crouch Junior. Luckily, players who like to dabble in the Unforgivable Curses won&#39;t have to worry about being sentenced to prison time themselves, as the pros of dark magic outweigh the cons in the RPG. Still, those wanting to pay a friendly visit to Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy can do so, provided they make the correct choice.

 Only Hufflepuff Students Can Go To Azkaban In Hogwarts Legacy 
          

To get into Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy, players must join Hufflepuff at the start of their playthrough, as the prison can only be accessed through Hufflepuff&#39;s House exclusive quest. After progressing through the game&#39;s first few missions, and then saving an elderly woman near the Great Lake, the protagonist will receive a letter via owl, instructing them to speak to the portrait of Eldritch Diggory in the Hufflepuff common room. From there, it&#39;s as simple as following the &#34;Prisoner of Love&#34; quest and making their way into the prison alongside the former Auror, Helen Thistlewood. Unfortunately, this means it&#39;s impossible for Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw students to visit Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy.






 What Happens Inside Azkaban In Hogwarts Legacy 
          

Inside, the player and Helen are seeking out a certain Anne Thisbe, who they believe has been wrongfully imprisoned. They Apparate into Azkaban and are instantly met with some hostile Dementors, who Helen dispels using the Expecto Patronum charm. However, these soul-sucking creatures aren&#39;t the most dangerous beings within Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s prison. The two eventually find Anne, who gives the player some clues as to the location of Jackdaw&#39;s pages, but before the two can leave, she lashes out and attacks Helen, critically wounding her. So, while the two are able to escape in the end, it&#39;s not without a few intense moments.


 




Once the student and Helen have Apparated back out to safety, it&#39;s impossible to visit Azkaban for a second time. Ultimately, it&#39;s quite a brief and linear stay, but it&#39;s nonetheless a worthwhile venture, especially for Harry Potter fans who have seen or read about the notorious prison. With any luck, a DLC could expand upon this quest in the future and potentially allow other Houses to join in on the fun - but for now, only Hufflepuffs can get into Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy.
