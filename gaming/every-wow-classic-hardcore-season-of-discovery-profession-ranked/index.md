## Literature Review

World of Warcraft Classic has introduced the Season of Discovery and Hardcore servers, where death is permanent. But professions can save you.




The professions in World of Warcraft have changed a lot from expansion to expansion. Now, with the Season of Discovery revitalizing WoW Classic and the option to play on Hardcore servers, the original form of professions has regained relevancy. With the additional threat of permanent death from Hardcore, professions are now crucial to surviving and avoiding the loss of all items and progress.
Like in Retail WoW, professions are still classified into primary and secondary types. Each character is limited to only two primary professions, such as Herbalism and Alchemy, but can learn all three secondary professions (Fishing, Cooking, and First Aid). This means that it&#39;s important to pick the right professions early to avoid having to lose progress and start from the beginning with a new one.

 10  Fishing 
Useful For Cooking &amp; Getting Gold


 







Fishing is a secondary profession, so there&#39;s no reason not to learn it. It&#39;s a nice way to gather Cooking supplies, which can then be sold on the auction house. However, it&#39;s not essential for WoW Classic on regular or Hardcore mode, even when using Cooking to craft buff food regularly.





 9  Leatherworking 
Decent For Leather Classes Later
        

Leatherworking isn&#39;t necessarily a bad profession, but for Hardcore in particular, it&#39;s not the best option because it doesn&#39;t offer much in terms of adding survivability to a character. It&#39;s also reliant on Skinning, which takes up the second primary profession slot in order to avoid using the auction house to acquire every reagent to craft items. Later, Leatherworkers can craft some nice gear that&#39;s useful for dungeons and raids, but for Hardcore, the challenge is making it to late game at all.

 8  Blacksmithing 
Useful In Late Game
        

Blacksmithing is in the same place as Leatherworking for Hardcore. The ability to craft weapons and gear later in the game is nice, but it doesn&#39;t offer much for survivability, which is required for Hardcore to even make it to late game. It&#39;s reliant on Mining to avoid buying all the reagents. However, when not on Hardcore servers, both Blacksmithing and Leatherworking can be nice for crafting gear while leveling. And getting recipes that drop from mobs is easier since death isn&#39;t permanent.





 7  Enchanting 
Difficult Reagent Gathering
        

On one hand, Enchanting adds the ability to give buffs to gear. On the other hand, getting reagents can be tough if it isn&#39;t paired with Tailoring, which allows uncommon quality and higher items to be crafted and then Disenchanted for reagents. Otherwise, there&#39;s a lot of reliance on the auction house, quest rewards, and dungeon drops, and the last option isn&#39;t great on Hardcore given the risk of death.

 6  Gathering (Mining, Skinning, &amp; Herbalism) 
All Gathering Options Have The Same Pros &amp; Cons


 







Mining, Skinning, and Herbalism make up the three available professions that are centered around gathering reagents for other professions. As such, they are fairly equivalent when it comes to the quality and worthiness of choosing them in WoW Classic and Hardcore. The biggest bonuses from them are being able to gather reagents instead of purchasing them, but also being able to sell gathered items on the auction house to acquire gold. The downside is that these professions don&#39;t offer survivability alone as professions, but when paired with professions like Alchemy for Herbalism, then their usefulness increases significantly.





 5  Tailoring 
Not Reliant On Gathering
        

Tailoring is among the few professions that don&#39;t need to be paired with another profession for optimal usefulness. The greatest benefit of Tailoring is the ability to craft bags to increase inventory size. Not only is this useful for the character crafting the bags, but extra bags can be put on the auction house for a nice way to make gold. It helps that cloth is gathered from humanoid enemies instead of a gathering profession, and then thread can be purchased from NPC vendors.





 4  First Aid 
Healing Without Mana
        

As a secondary profession, First Aid can be picked up by every character. And on Hardcore servers, it probably should be picked up and leveled by every character, because bandages can help healers in dungeons and save them some mana instead of making them use more spells. The ability to make anti-venom as well helps here because it saves the mana and time of a spellcast, which could end up saving a party member&#39;s life depending on the fight.





 3  Engineering 
Craft Support Tools
        

Engineering might not seem like it should be high-ranking, but it actually gives characters the ability to craft tools that help with survival. Target Dummies and Bombs in particular can make the difference between living and dying during a battle, and that makes this profession a game-changer when playing on a Hardcore server. It helps to pair it with Mining because some recipes require a lot of reagents, and that can get expensive when purchasing them. But even then, it&#39;s worth picking up for the survivability alone.





 2  Alchemy 
Potions Are Crucial
        

From Health Potions to elixirs, Alchemy might be the best profession available in WoW Classic and Hardcore, at least among the primary professions where choices are limited to two and gathering comes into play. Mana Potions and Health Potions are a healer&#39;s best friend, but having elixirs for a steady buff that can last through a dungeon is also invaluable when permanent death looms over the party.





 1  Cooking 
The Power Of Food Buffs &amp; Regen


 







What sets Cooking above Alchemy is the simple fact that every character can pick it up, since it&#39;s a secondary profession. It also doesn&#39;t need to be linked to a gathering profession for the sake of saving gold, as most of the reagents can be gathered from enemies or purchased from NPC vendors in the case of spices. The result is crafting food that gives bonus stats, and having a supply of food and drinks that can keep the party&#39;s health and mana topped off. Also, Rogues have the additional benefit of being able to make Thistle Tea to restore energy.
WoW Classic Hardcore is a challenge that isn&#39;t something everybody wants to take on, but those who do will want to choose their professions wisely given how many more benefits some have compared to others. However, even when playing on regular Classic servers, the benefits of picking some professions over others can still be reaped. In the end, professions come down to personal preference, but this list can help when deciding which offers the most benefits when playing World of Warcraft ClassicSeason of Discovery and Hardcore.
