## Literature Review

Batman: Arkham Trilogy has undergone a lot of changes to be playable on the Switch. Here’s what’s different in the Switch port, for better or worse.




For better or worse, the Nintendo Switch version of the Batman: Arkham Trilogy includes many changes from the games&#39; original versions. The Batman: Arkham series actually consists of four primary games released between 2009 and 2015: Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, Arkham Origins, and Arkham Knight. The Switch collection includes three of the above, leaving out the prequel Origins.
Naturally, these three games had to undergo a lot of reconfiguration for their Switch port. The original releases spanned two console generations, and specification-wise, the Switch lands right in the middle of the two. It&#39;s more powerful than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but less powerful than the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. So, while some of the changes exist solely to make these games playable on the Switch, others improve on aspects of the original game. Others are thrown in just for fun. Here are some of the biggest differences between the Switch version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy, the three games&#39; original releases, and their last-gen remasters.

 10  The Arkham Trilogy Has Two Resolution Settings On Switch 
Batman: Arkham Trilogy Plays In 1080p Docked, 720p Handheld
        

The Batman: Arkham Trilogy&#39;s visual resolution on Switch depends entirely on how it&#39;s played. Like many Switch games, it plays in 720p on the built-in, handheld screen, but can go up to 1080p when connected to a TV. Arkham Asylum and Arkham City were originally locked to 720p on consoles, with more flexible graphics settings on PC. Arkham Knight runs in 1080p on the PS4, as do the remasters of Asylum and City, with dynamic resolution sometimes reaching 1080p on the Xbox One. So, compared to the original versions, Arkham Asylum looks slightly better overall on a docked Switch, but City and Knight look slightly worse on a handheld one.





 9  The Arkham Trilogy Has A Locked Framerate On Switch 
Batman: Arkham Trilogy Is Locked At 30 FPS, But Isn&#39;t Consistent
        

Much like their resolutions, the framerate of each game in the Batman: Arkham Trilogy varies based on version and platform. All three games are locked at 30 FPS on the consoles they were launched for, but with the right specs, it&#39;s possible to hit 60 and above on PC. 60 FPS is also achievable when running the PS4 version of Arkham Knight on the PS5. However, all three games in the Switch version of the Arkham Trilogy are always locked to 30 FPS, period. But that&#39;s anything but consistent - the game frequently sees dips into the low- to mid-20s.





 8  The Arkham Trilogy Has Downgraded Weather Effects On Switch 
So Much For Gotham&#39;s Rainy Ambiance


 







Weather effects have been downgraded across the board in the Switch version of the Arkham Trilogy. It&#39;s not quite as blatant as the GTA remasters&#39; blinding rain effect, but it&#39;s still noticeably worse than the original versions. What that means for each game varies. In the Switch version of Arkham Asylum, it&#39;s always drizzling in Gotham. It escapes notice after a while, and can even add to the atmosphere. Arkham City&#39;s frequent snowfall has a similar effect. However, Arkham Knight&#39;s weather effects have undergone the most noticeable changes. Various weather events can occur during the course of the game, and can cause the framerate to dip further at certain times.

 7  The Arkham Trilogy Has Better (Or Worse) Textures On Switch 
Comparing The Switch Versions&#39; Textures Is Complicated
        

Textures are a major indicator of a game&#39;s overall visual fidelity. Just how sharp and detailed they are determines the way every object in a game looks, whether it&#39;s flat and uninteresting or seems to pop out of the screen. Now, the original versions of Arkham Asylum and City were released for the seventh generation of home consoles, with low-resolution textures by today&#39;s standards. Their remasters, however, along with Arkham Knight, are available on the eighth console generation with improved, higher-definition textures. The Switch version lands somewhere in between: Asylum and City have textures that look better than their original versions, but worse than their remasters. Knight looks generally worse.





 6  The Arkham Trilogy Has Less Detailed Lighting Effects On Switch 
Downgrading Gotham&#39;s Neon-Lit, Noir Aesthetic
        

The Batman: Arkham Trilogy is characterized by night settings with sparse lighting, which often filters through the rain and snow to create a melancholy, even otherworldly effect. This is greatly improved upon in Arkham Asylum and City&#39;s remasters for the PS4 and Xbox One, taking advantage of those consoles&#39; higher dynamic ranges to create dark shadows and bright glares. It&#39;s perhaps at its best in Arkham Knight, which was built from the ground up for the eighth generation. Unfortunately, the Switch version trades dramatic lighting for better performance, giving the games a flatter appearance.





 5  The Switch Version Of The Arkham Trilogy Has Smaller File Sizes 
The Batman: Arkham Games Fit Better On Switch, But At What Cost?
        

Due to all of the above graphical and performance downgrades, almost every game in Batman: Arkham Trilogy has a smaller file size on the Switch than it does on other platforms. The comparisons are as follows:
  Game Title   PC/Steam File Size   Switch File Size    Batman: Arkham Asylum   8 GB   6.8 GB    Batman: Arkham City   17 GB   11.9 GB    Batman: Arkham Knight   45 GB   27.3 GB    
This also helps the games fit on the Switch&#39;s relatively small built-in hard drive space. Without expanding its storage, the Switch only has a capacity of 32 GB - not even enough to hold all three games in the Arkham Trilogy. That issue is further compounded by another difference between the remasters and the Switch port.





 4  The Physical Edition Of The Arkham Trilogy On Switch Only Includes One Game 
Arkham Asylum Is On Switch, But City And Knight Are Only Available Via Digital Download


 







The three games in Batman: Arkham Trilogy can be purchased either digitally through Nintendo&#39;s eShop, or together as a physical bundle wherever games are sold. However, the cartridge included with the physical edition of Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch only contains one game: Arkham Asylum. Inside the package are download codes for Arkham City and Arkham Knight, but these games can&#39;t be purchased in physical form for the Switch. When they were first released, all three games were available both physically and digitally, but the remastered Arkham Collection for PS4 followed a similar strategy. It included Arkham Asylum and City on disc, with a download code for Knight bundled in.

The Arkhamverse version of Batman is far more intricate than some fans would expect, especially those who didn&#39;t read the comic spinoffs. 



This is damaging to the game&#39;s resale value, and problematic due to the Switch&#39;s storage constraints. Once the codes have been redeemed, the physical version only consists of a single game, which will never be resalable for anything resembling the original price. Since Arkham City and Knight exceed the Switch&#39;s natural storage capacity, players can never have both of them installed without investing in another SD card. And since Arkham Knight alone takes up over 85% of the Switch&#39;s 32 GB hard drive, they&#39;ll have to delete almost all their other games to fit it.





 3  The Arkham Trilogy Has Less Detailed Physics On Switch 
It&#39;s Most Noticeable On Batman&#39;s Cape
        

One of the most interesting visual effects created in the Arkham Trilogy is that of Batman&#39;s cape. As he glides from rooftop to rooftop, the edges of the fabric ripple. It&#39;s masterfully done in the PS4 and Xbox One remaster - it&#39;s almost possible to feel the air rushing past. But in the Switch version, the effect is far clunkier, as if the cape is made of thick, wobbly plastic. This is a tiny detail, but it&#39;s indicative of a larger problem: less subtle, detailed physics are apparent throughout the entirety of all three games.





 2  The Switch Version Of Arkham Knight Includes Robert Pattinson&#39;s Batsuit 
The Batman Suit Is Available Free With The Arkham Trilogy On Switch
        

To make the prospect of playing Batman: Arkham Knight again more appealing, the Switch version has added one bit of new content: an equippable Batsuit resembling the one worn by Robert Pattinson in the 2021 movie The Batman. This is available free with all copies of the Arkham Trilogy on Switch, and is exclusive to the platform for a month after launch. Those who own the game on other platforms should be able to equip the Batsuit beginning in January 2024.





 1  The Batmobile Breaks Arkham Knight On Switch 
The Arkham Trilogy&#39;s Batmobile Is Its Greatest Weakness


 







The Batman: Arkham Trilogy has performance problems across the board, but the most egregious are the issues with the Batmobile in Arkham Knight. Driving the Batmobile practically breaks the game, slowing its framerate to an untenable crawl. This is probably because the Batmobile moves too quickly, causing too many objects to load at once, thus degrading the game&#39;s performance. This has never been an issue before, but it creates a wrinkle in gameplay. While there are other methods of traversal, getting across town speedily is only viable in the Batmobile. Some activities outright require it - there&#39;s a system of vehicular combat that often takes a pivotal role in story missions.
With so many downgrades and issues, the Switch version may not be the best way to experience the Batman: Arkham Trilogy. However, it is nice to have all three games available in one package, even if some of them require separate downloads. And the portability of the Switch version is nice, even if its performance doesn&#39;t stack up to the PC and home console versions. While these won&#39;t be a dealbreaker for everyone, it&#39;s important to weigh the differences before committing to the Switch version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy.
