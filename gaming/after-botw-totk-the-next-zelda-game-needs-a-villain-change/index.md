# After BOTW &amp; TOTK, The Next Zelda Game Needs A Villain Change


## SUMMARY 



  The Legend of Zelda may benefit from a different main villain in the next game to avoid repetition and to bring innovation to the forces of evil.   Introducing other final bosses can make Ganon&#39;s appearances more special and memorable, while also preventing his character from becoming boring.   Constantly having Ganon return as the main villain can potentially undermine the sense of achievement and make the efforts of Link and the player feel pointless.

## Literature Review

With Ganondorf defeated once more in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the franchise should change its lead villain for the next title.




When the next entry in The Legend of Zelda series arrives, the title arguably deserves a change in its main villain. Different forms of Ganon – and his Gerudo form, Ganondorf – have been the final boss of Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild before it, each an immense game in their own right. However, the next Zelda title may well be a better game if it has a different villain pulling the strings.




Ganon, or Ganondorf depending on his specific incarnation, is a recurring threat to the Kingdom of Hyrule. The result of the Demon King Demise’s powerful curse, Ganon has tried to conquer Hyrule many times. Of course, Link always puts a stop to the King of Evil’s plans, but through reincarnations, resurrections, or breaking seals placed upon him, Ganon always returns once more. Whether he appears as a Gerudo man or pig-like beast, he is an iconic figure in the Zelda series, in the upper echelon alongside Link and Zelda. As such, it is unsurprising that he has served as the main villain for the two most recent (and biggest ever) Zelda games.

                  The Next Zelda Should Learn From BOTW &amp; TOTK, But Skip One Key Feature   Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom brought a lot of new features to the Zelda series, but the next game should skip one key feature.   


 Ganon Should Take a Break From Zelda Game Appearances 
          




Between Calamity Ganon and Demon King Ganondorf, The Legend of Zelda’s most iconic villain has most recently been extremely prominent in the series. However, when it comes to the next game, whether it is another sprawling adventure or a smaller game, it would arguably be better to have a different main villain. Having Ganon return yet again in quick succession would undoubtedly begin to feel repetitive, perhaps even stale. As such, although the end of Tears of the Kingdom will certainly not be the last people will ever see of him, the franchise taking a break from Ganon to put another villain in the spotlight may be for the best.



When counting the linked portion of the Oracle titles as one game, Ganon/Ganondorf has appeared in 11 of the main Zelda games.




Having Ganon become boring would be nothing less than a tragedy for the series. As popular as he is, Ganon’s various appearances need to be balanced out with other evil figures in other titles. In addition to allowing for innovation in the forces of evil, introducing other final bosses helps to make every appearance of Ganon himself that much more special and memorable. If he goes unseen for a game or two, then Ganon’s return will have a far greater impact than if he appeared in every intervening game as well.




It is also worth noting that if Ganon returns time after time for every new release, then this could actually sour people’s reactions to his presence. After all, if he reemerges straight away in every new game, then it could begin to feel as if the efforts of Link (and the player) are ultimately pointless. If every effort to defeat Ganon is effectively undone to set up the next game’s plot, then it could strip away the accompanying sense of achievement. This is especially a problem when it comes to such lengthy games as BOTW and TOTK, fully exploring which can easily take upwards of a hundred hours each.

                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   



 The Legend Of Zelda Has Featured Many Interesting Antagonists 
          




While Ganon is The Legend of Zelda’s most memorable villain, he is far from the only major threat presented by the series. There are plenty of other villains who could return in future Zelda games, such as other notable demonic entities like Majora or Malladus. For example, the presence of Majora’s Mask in BOTW and TOTK, even if it has lost most of its power, suggests that the demon has survived in some small way since its defeat. As such, Link uncovering the mask could act as foreshadowing for the malevolent entity’s return to power.

With that being said, there are other villains who could return in Ganon’s stead. His adoptive mothers, Koume and Kotake, are a possibility given their cameo appearances in TOTK, although Twinrova is generally seen as supporters of Ganon rather than independent villains in their own right. In fact, their most recent appearance seemed to almost tease a boss fight in TOTK, although in actuality, such a thing never occurs. Vaati the Wind Mage, who is another recurring character in the series, is another possibility. After his defeat in Four Swords Adventures, however, this would likely require him to be reincarnated (which is in itself far from an impossibility in Hyrule).






 A New Zelda Villain Could Reinvigorate The Series 
         

On the other hand, the next Zelda game could introduce an entirely new villain to serve as the overarching antagonist. In this case, the possibilities are truly endless, and would allow for a figure more thematically appropriate to a given game’s design than Ganon himself may be. For example, while Ganondorf made excellent and devastating use of his stolen Secret Stone in TOTK, it is interesting to consider how the game might have played out if a Zonai had played a prominent antagonistic role, whether as a traitor supporting Ganondorf or as a villain in place of him.

The Legend of Zelda series is no stranger to standalone final bosses, despite Ganon’s popularity. In addition to those mentioned previously, Link has battled others such as the squid-like Bellum in Phantom Hourglass and Link’s Awakening’s amorphous Shadow Nightmares. As a result, the series as a whole is full of unique enemies and the next game could very easily add to that number. Whether or not this game is a true sequel to Tears of the Kingdom, a brand new final boss would immediately help to set it apart from the preceding titles.




The imposing figure of Ganon, or Ganondorf as the case may be, is immediately recognizable to many, and the villain is synonymous with The Legend of Zelda. But despite this, as a recurring villain, it is also possible that if Ganon is repeatedly used as the primary antagonist, then both his personal impact and the imperative to defeat him can suffer. As a result, changing the villain of the next Legend of Zelda game to somebody else, whether a previously established character or somebody entirely new, would perhaps be for the best. Many would undoubtedly welcome the change of pace, at least for a short while.
