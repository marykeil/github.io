# Pokémon Gen 10 Games Should Steal This From Indigo Disk DLC (&amp; It s Not The Synchro Machine)


## SUMMARY 



  The second DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, The Indigo Disk, introduces new gameplay elements and a brand-new region, expanding the potential for future games.   The DLC includes subtle references to advanced strategies from the competitive Pokémon scene, providing a challenge for experienced players and potentially teaching new players about high-level tactics.   The inclusion of these advanced strategies in The Indigo Disk shows that the developers are aware of the competitive Pokémon scene and may continue to incorporate similar tactics in future games.

## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet does something new with its trainers. Here’s what it is, and why it should reappear in Gen 10 games and beyond.




Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s second DLC, The Indigo Disk, provides a lot of inspiration for future games. For one thing, it and its predecessor, The Teal Mask, take place in a brand-new region: the idyllic, mountainous Kitakami. They also bring hundreds of new and returning Pokémon to Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Pokédex. There are great new battle conditions and concepts, a wide variety of rival trainers, new ways to train and bond with Pokémon - suffice it to say there&#39;s infinite potential for Gen 10 to explore and expand on ideas introduced in The Indigo Disk.




But as interesting as the big-picture stuff is, some of The Indigo Disk&#39;s coolest new ideas are subtle and hard to find. They may not even be recognized by inexperienced players, since they reference arcane strategies and iconic community moments that go back multiple generations. But for those in the know, they&#39;re there, and they&#39;re unbelievable. And they could have fascinating implications for the future of trainer battles in the next generation of Pokémon games.

                  Why Perrin Is Missing In Your Indigo Disk DLC For Scarlet &amp; Violet   Although Perrin is an important character in The Indigo Disk, some players may not be able to find her, cutting off access to certain rare Pokémon.   


 Pokémon: The Indigo Disk Trainers Have Started Using Competitive Tactics 
Wait, Where&#39;d They Learn The FEAR Strategy?
          

NPCs encountered during The Indigo Disk DLC have been caught using tactics employed by advanced, competitive, human Pokémon trainers against the unsuspecting player character. In particular, one random trainer in The Indigo Disk&#39;s Savannah Biome appears to employ a piece of the Pokémon video games&#39; competitive meta called FEAR tactics. Employing FEAR is a complicated strategy that requires a significant amount of planning ahead, along with a little bit of quick thinking. However, it can be incredibly useful in getting a trainer out of a tight spot.




FEAR stands for &#34;Focus Sash, Endeavor, [Quick] Attack, Rattata.&#34; These are four common items, moves, and Pokémon employed in this strategy, but they&#39;re all pretty variable. First, players will need one of several capable &#34;FEAR Pokémon&#34; on their team. Per the original acronym, Rattata works just fine, but there are many Pokémon, including several Gen 9 exclusives, who can do the job just as well, if not better. In order to be considered a FEAR Pokémon, a team member must be able to learn Endeavor and Quick Attack, or any other high-priority offensive move that strikes first. It&#39;s also best for them to be at a relatively low level.

Next, the trainer will want to give a Focus Sash, which prevents the Pokémon holding it from being knocked out in one hit, to their intended FEAR Pokémon. This can only be used once per battle before it&#39;s destroyed, so those hoping to use the FEAR strategy multiple times will want to stock up on as many Focus Sashes as possible.






In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Focus Sashes are most easily obtained from the Delibird Presents in Mesagoza, where they may be purchased for 50,000 Pokémon Dollars each.




Just prior to battle, the FEAR Pokémon should be placed in any position other than first. If one of their stronger or more prominent Pokémon faints, the trainer can switch in their FEAR Pokémon. The opposing trainer should strike the seemingly easy target immediately, hopefully dealing enough damage to knock them out - if only they weren&#39;t wearing that Focus Sash, which ensures their HP stays at one. On their next turn, the FEAR Pokémon should use Endeavor, which causes the opposing Pokémon&#39;s HP to match their own. Then, they won&#39;t have time to heal before the FEAR Pokémon&#39;s Quick Attack on the next turn, which should knock them out.

                  All Shiny Locked Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC introduces several new monsters and 25 returning Legendaries, but a lot of Pokémon are Shiny locked.   




It&#39;s not a foolproof strategy: some Pokémon, like Ghost-types that take no damage from Normal- and Fighting-type attacks, won&#39;t even flinch. Multi-hit attacks and damage-over-time effects can also disrupt it, knocking out a FEAR Pokémon even if they&#39;re wearing a Focus Sash. Savvy opponents can counter with priority attacks of their own, which may still beat the FEAR Pokémon&#39;s Quick Attack in turn order. And of course, if the opposing Pokémon is holding an HP-restoring item, they may be able to heal before the FEAR Pokémon can hit them. However, it can be an indispensable last-ditch effort, and it&#39;s impressive to see NPC trainers using it in The Indigo Disk.



 How High-Level Pokémon Strategies Could Play Into Gen 10 
         

In future games, it&#39;s possible that FEAR and other high-level Pokémon meta strategies could be employed by NPC trainers. This would make fighting those trainers significantly harder for less experienced players, but would be a welcome challenge for those familiar with the competitive scene. As a result, trainers with knowledge of high-level strategies would probably have to be high-level opponents - it&#39;d be a little jarring, not to mention cruel, for some random Route One lad to pull off a Perish Trap. But if the members of the next Pokémon game&#39;s Elite Four took advantage of these strategies, it&#39;d create some truly challenging late-game battles.




And this wouldn&#39;t just have advantages for more experienced or competitive players of the Pokémon franchise. Getting into the competitive scene of any game can be daunting; as a new player, it&#39;s all too common to feel like there are a million unwritten rules and obscure concepts one isn&#39;t privy to. NPC trainers provide the perfect arena for practice. There&#39;s no shame in losing to them, since no one needs to know that the player had to drag themselves to a Pokémon Center before trying again.

So, instead of randomly throwing out these tactics to surprise high-level players, future Pokémon games could use them as teachable moments. Ease players into various advanced strategies over the course of a campaign, and they&#39;ll likely become stronger trainers with a vested interest in the competitive Pokémon scene by the end of it.

The inclusion of the FEAR strategy in The Indigo Disk demonstrates awareness on the developers&#39; part. Programming NPCs to use advanced tactics means that Pokémon&#39;s creators understand and acknowledge its competitive scene. They don&#39;t necessarily expect players to do the same, but it helps; knowing that the FEAR strategy is coming is the first step in learning to counter it. This may be the first time the Pokémon games have done something like this, but it is an interesting example. Hopefully, whatever comes next after Pokémon Scarlet and Violet puts similar tactics to use.
