## Literature Review

The allegedly leaked release date for Gaming in Genshin Impact 4.4 makes a lot of sense, mostly due to another anticipated character’s release.




The release date for Gaming in Genshin Impact 4.4 has allegedly leaked, and considering another character in the game, it makes perfect sense. Gaming is a new playable character in the upcoming Version. While he had previously been referred to as the “lion boy” by leakers, he and his design have since been confirmed by HoYoverse. Other than his Pyro Vision and outfit, however, little else is officially known about Gaming. Nevertheless, leaks have detailed nearly everything about him, including Gaming’s kit in Genshin Impact 4.4, which highlights him as a claymore user. These leaks help give further insight into how he will operate in combat.




The game has long been plagued by leaks and Gaming has been referenced since before the release of the Nation of Fontaine in Version 4.0. His leaked gameplay kit is just another example of the information some players have access to from testing sessions. Through these abilities, however, it is possible to determine why the new mention of Gaming’s exact release date makes so much sense – it turns out that Gaming’s release may actually match the debut of another character, Xianyun in Genshin Impact 4.4. There are, of course, other factors that give extra credibility to Gaming’s release in the action RPG.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream - Date, Time, &amp; What To Expect   The special livestream program for Genshin Impact&#39;s Version 4.4 should be occurring soon, as the game progresses further into Version 4.3.   


 Gaming May Be Featured In Phase 1 Banners In Genshin Impact 4.4 
         




According to a new leak by HXG, posted by a user on Reddit, Gaming is expected to debut and be featured with an increased drop rate in the same banner as Xianyun. As Gaming is said to be a 4-star hero and Xianyun is expected to be a 5-star unit, Gaming should be part of Xianyun’s character banner. Other leaks about Phase 1 banners in Genshin Impact 4.4 indicate that Xianyun will be one of the first 5-star heroes in the upcoming Version, so players may actually have a chance of grabbing Gaming as soon as the update arrives.



Based on the game’s regular six-week schedule for every update, Version 4.4 should become available on January 31. This would be when Phase 1 banners arrive as well. Of course, January 31 is the date if there are no unexpected delays in HoYoverse’s schedule.






 Why Gaming’s Debut In Xianyun’s Banner Makes Sense For Genshin Impact 4.4 
          




Gaming’s alleged debut in the Phase 1 banners along with Xianyun’s own rumored debut seems to make a lot of sense in terms of gameplay. According to Gaming’s leaked gameplay kit, he is a main DPS unit that specializes in dealing damage through special Plunging Attacks, which are activated by the usage of his Elemental Skill. Even if it deals its own form of damage, Gaming’s own Elemental Burst is interpreted as a means of resetting the cooldown on his Elemental Skill, which would then allow him to repeatedly execute the special forms of Plunging Attacks infused with the Pyro element in Genshin Impact for increased damage output.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Free Skin Offer May Be Better Than You Think   Genshin Impact players may finally be getting some generous treatment in Version 4.4 with the arrival of a surprising though limited tool.   

Xianyun’s leaked gameplay kit, on the other hand, indicates that she is a support and sub-DPS unit. The humanoid form of the Adepti known as Cloud Retainer is said to create a special buff with her Elemental Burst that allows the active character to jump higher – and, by jumping higher, they are capable of executing Plunging Attacks. This would match Gaming’s alleged kit, which is based on striking from midair. Even if not buffed by his own leaked Elemental Skill, thus not infused with Pyro, Gaming could continuously use Plunging Attacks in Genshin Impact, made possible by the rumored buff provided by Xianyun.




Having a character’s release match the banner of other characters they pair up with nicely is not exactly something new in the game. A very recent example, in fact, is Chevreuse. The 4-star Pyro unit from Fontaine was introduced as an NPC in the first half of Version 4.3 but made her debut as a playable character in Phase 2 banners of Genshin Impact 4.3. This allowed her to be featured in the special rerun banners for Yoimiya and Raiden Shogun. This makes perfect sense for gameplay since Chevreuse’s entire kit revolves around the execution of Overloaded, an Elemental Reaction that occurs when Pyro interacts with Electro.



For reference, Yoimiya is a solid Pyro unit, while Raiden Shogun is known to be one of the best Electro characters in the game.




Much like Chevreuse debuting in banners of 5-star characters that are a good match for her, Gaming may as well follow that same path and debut in a banner where the rumored 5-star character is said to be a good fit for him. Of course, leaks should always be taken with a grain of salt, as they may be inaccurate or subject to change. HoYoverse may decide to release the rumored 4-star character in Genshin Impact 4.4’s Phase 2 banners rather than in Phase 1 – if Xianyun’s banner is in Phase 1, that is – much like Chevreuse only arrived in Phase 2 of Version 4.3.






 Gaming’s Release May Also Match A Rumored Event In Genshin Impact 4.4 
          

Other than the allegedly complementing gameplay kits, which would be one argument to sustain why Gaming could debut in Phase 1 banners with Xianyun, there may actually be another reason: the annual Lantern Rite Festival event. Gaming has been confirmed to be a character from Liyue Harbor, as seen in the post made on the official Genshin Impact account on X. With the Lantern Rite Festival being the flagship event for the region of Liyue, it would be lore appropriate to have Gaming debut in Phase 1, when the event itself is rumored to occur and be in the spotlight.

                  New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.   




Of course, there is no rule about this. Fontaine had its flagship event, the Fontinalia Festival, in Phase 1 of Version 4.3, and while Chevreuse first appeared as an NPC during that event, she only became playable in the Phase 2 banners. Most of the Version 4.4 leaks so far have been reasonable, though unconfirmed. As such, it is best to await an official reveal by HoYoverse during the upcoming Version 4.4 livestream, which is expected to air on January 19, if there are no delays. If the leaks are all true, Genshin Impact 4.4 may be filled with exciting content, even with its rumored lack of Archon Quests.
