## Literature Review

Beyond Good &amp; Evil is officially returning. Here&#39;s everything we know so far about the upcoming 20th Anniversary Edition of the classic title.




Beyond Good &amp; Evil is celebrating a major birthday this year, and an updated version of the game called Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is set to release in commemoration of the event. As an action-adventure title from Ubisoft that originally released on sixth-generation consoles, Beyond Good &amp; Evil made a mark with a unique world and story that could be explored through diverse gameplay. Despite initially failing to generate strong sales, the years have been kind to the title, earning it a loyal following that outmatches many of its contemporaries.




The Beyond Good &amp; Evil franchise hasn&#39;t exactly been dormant for the full span of the twenty years since its release, but it hasn&#39;t been fully active either. The original title received an HD re-release on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and can still be purchased on Steam and Ubisoft Connect for PC play. Beyond Good and Evil 2 was teased in 2008 and announced with a cinematic trailer in 2017, but the long development cycle and a lack of transparency regarding development progress casts a certain shadow, and the departure of the game&#39;s director and unfortunate passing of creative director Emile Morel has further complicated matters.

 When Beyond Good &amp; Evil Releases 
          




The existence of the Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition was revealed through an early development version that accidentally went live to some Ubisoft&#43; members, followed by a listing on the Xbox Store that likewise seems to have gone public earlier than intended. As reported by IGN and confirmed by Ubisoft, a &#34;technical error&#34; caused the issue, but the publisher has taken advantage of the situation to establish an early 2024 window for the release. Ubisoft also said that it plans to share more information &#34;in the new year.&#34;

Unless the definition of new year is being used loosely, major additional details aren&#39;t likely to arrive at The Game Awards 2023 or any other December opportunity. That being said, an official trailer does seem like a viable candidate for the Game Awards, as the timing of the accidental reveal is suspiciously close to the ceremony. Regardless, it shouldn&#39;t be especially long before all details of the release are clarified, and the ability to play the final version of the Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is set to arrive within the coming months.




The early 2024 window narrowly misses the actual 20th anniversary of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, although it&#39;s close enough to maintain the relevance of the new subtitle. It&#39;s possible that the remaster received some delays during development, but it also may have been shifted thanks to the delays of other Ubisoft titles. The final few months of the year ended up filling out a busy schedule for the publisher, with a minor delay moving Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage from August to October and larger setbacks pushing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora from its initial 2022 plans all the way to a December 2023 launch.

 Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition Changes &amp; New Content 
         




Although the Xbox store page for Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is no longer directly accessible, a tweet from Wario64 copies the description that was available on the listing, which lays out a number of core remaster changes for the new edition to improve the basic game experience. Up to 4K resolution and 60 FPS performance will be offered, which might vary between the Xbox One and the more powerful Series X/S. Improved graphics are also promised, which remain in-line with the original look of the game but improve some aspects of detail and clarity per the available screenshots.


 

Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition should also receive some basic quality-of-life improvements, with reworked controls hopefully helping with some of the original game&#39;s clunkiness and autosave and cross-save features making it easier to save and transfer progress. The 20th Anniversary Edition will also feature content additions to the game. A new treasure hunt and an added speedrun mode might be able to entice veteran players, along with updated achievements and an &#34;anniversary gallery&#34; that chronicles secrets and details of the game and its development.




                  Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 Still Happening &amp; Aiming High, Ubisoft Insists [UPDATED]   A recent Ubisoft job listing confirms that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in development - and shows the company has high hopes for its release.    



 Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition Platforms 
          

The full scope of the platform options that will be available when Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition releases isn&#39;t yet clear, although some basic information can be gleaned from the accidental reveals. The game will be playable on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S and use the Smart Delivery system, which means that an Xbox One purchase will provide access to an upgraded version on the Series X/S. Although other platforms haven&#39;t yet been officially confirmed, there&#39;s no reason to expect that the title would be exclusive to Microsoft systems.




The accidental reveal through Ubisoft&#43; implies that the title will follow recent Ubisoft releases in being available on the publisher&#39;s subscription service along with standard storefronts for modern systems. News regarding any potential special editions or physical releases hasn&#39;t come yet, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time that Ubisoft has put out physical copies of new editions of older titles. Pre-orders are likely to be available sometime in the near future, which should make the specific options on the table for purchasing Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition across platforms clear.



Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition was rated by the ESRB for the Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch earlier this year, so it would likely take a change of plans for it not to release on all major modern systems.




The surprise appearance of Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition might not have been the best way for the game to be revealed, as the version of the game that was briefly available on Ubisoft&#43; was from a clearly unfinished build of the game. Now that the cat is out of the bag, though, initial apprehension is likely to be overwhelmed by general anticipation for a new chance at playing the classic title. Beyond Good and Evil 2 is starting to feel all too much like a pipe dream, but Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is definitely real and visible on the horizon.
