## Literature Review

One of Spider-Man&#39;s classic villains, Rhino, was mentioned on Kraven&#39;s list of potential prey, but his fate was never revealed in the story.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has an impressive cast of characters, both in the form of returning allies, and menacing new threats such as Kraven the Hunter. Despite the fate of many of the past games&#39; villains being explicitly referenced as part of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s main campaign, there is one who appears on his list who is strangely absent from the game: Rhino.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man 2.]

Kraven&#39;s Great Hunt sees the ruthless game hunter traveling to New York with an army of hunters in search of &#34;worthy prey&#34;. However, it&#39;s later revealed that Kraven is actually embarking on a suicide mission to die at the hands of a worthy opponent during a hunt after being diagnosed with cancer. Many skilled but mortal hunters fail to kill him, so he turns his attention to the superpowered beings residing in the city instead.

The Great Hunt claims the lives of many of Spider-Man&#39;s iconic villains, with most being slain off-screen. The only notable exception to this is Scorpion, who is shown dying in a showdown with Kraven, who cuts off part of his tail and stabs him without much difficulty. As Mary Jane explores Kraven&#39;s compound further in the &#34;Good Men&#34; main story mission, she comes across several mementos on display such as Electro&#39;s armor and Vulture&#39;s wings. These are accompanied by screens with images labeled &#34;DECEASED&#34; and Kraven&#39;s recordings about how he defeated them in combat.

Shocker&#39;s gauntlets are also displayed alongside a screen confirming his death, but the name of his alter-ego, Herman Schultz, is spotted on the door of a holding cell opposite Martin Li&#39;s in Kraven&#39;s lair later in the game. Moments later, Miles Morales is placed into Kraven&#39;s arena and forced into a fight against Li, aka Mister Negative, and it&#39;s clearly stated that Li had been forced to kill others in this way to survive. With Shocker&#39;s holding cells being so near to the arena, this could imply that Shocker was actually one of Li&#39;s victims, rather than Kraven&#39;s, but the hunter would still be responsible for his death by proxy.




                  Most Shocking Deaths In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   From classic Spider-Man characters to beloved NPCs, Spider-Man 2&#39;s story features far more shocking deaths than the series&#39; previous two games.    



 A Glitch Revealed A Dark Fate For Rhino 
          

Rhino appeared on Kraven&#39;s list, but there was no other indication that the two villains met in the game, which would have felt like a bizarre omission if he had died by Kraven&#39;s hand like the others. As shared by YouTuber clkz, however, the series&#39; developer, Insomniac Games may have originally had a gruesome fate in store for Aleksei Sytsevich&#39;s armored villain.


 




By clipping under the water in the Financial District, players can explore beneath Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s New York map and can visit areas that only appear briefly in the game&#39;s campaign, such as the Emily May Foundation&#39;s particle accelerator, or Kraven&#39;s home. In the latter, a throne for Kraven can be seen surrounded by skulls, and the heads of some of his opponents are mounted on the wall behind it. These include Shocker, Scorpion, and Vulture, whose deaths are canon, and Rhino&#39;s in the center.



This glitch can be exploited by walking along the edge of the larger docks in the left section of the Financial District.




It&#39;s worth noting that all the mounted heads and Kraven&#39;s throne were low resolution and some were missing textures entirely, so it&#39;s likely this dark element of Kraven&#39;s story was cut in the earlier stages of development. If so, because Insomniac still opted to explicitly state that the other villains had been killed, it&#39;s possible that the creative team at the studio changed its mind about killing the character, especially with Kraven already working his way through so many of Spider-Man&#39;s villains.






 Rhino Has Appeared In Every Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man Game 
                                                                

Rhino&#39;s appearances in both Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales made him one of the series&#39; more memorable foes. While Rhino isn&#39;t a mastermind like Otto Octavius or Phin Mason&#39;s The Tinkerer, his sheer size and strength make him an intimidating opponent. Before facing Rhino as Peter Parker&#39;s Spider-Man, players had to navigate around him as a non-superpowered Miles Morales in the first Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man title. Being spotted in this section meant certain death, showing his ruthlessness toward the city&#39;s civilians and making for one of the game&#39;s most intense sequences.

Rhino was a larger presence in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, escaping custody in a destructive chase sequence in the opening moments of the game. He was later enhanced by the morally corrupt Roxxon Energy Corporation and attempted to kill Miles and Phin as they tried to escape the organization. When defeated, Rhino attempted to taunt Phin over the death of her brother and she stabbed him with her sword before Miles pushed her out of the base.




Although it wasn&#39;t revealed whether this killed Rhino or not at the time, his appearance on Kraven&#39;s list indicates that he was alive at the start of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Despite never properly appearing throughout Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s story, a vision of Rhino did appear very briefly in a Mr. Negative-powered sequence inside Peter Parker&#39;s mind. Even though it was brief, this did make Rhino one of the few Spider-Man villains to appear in all three of Insomniac&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games.

                  Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man 2: Every Villain Confirmed &amp; Teased So Far   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 will see Peter and Miles taking on a variety of different villains over the course of the game&#39;s campaign.    



 Could Rhino Return In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3? 
          




As Rhino&#39;s fate was cut from Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, there is the possibility that Insomniac changed its mind with regard to killing the character. Leading fans to believe Rhino could have died at the hands of Phin, however briefly, only to then have him be killed properly off-screen by Kraven in the sequel would have been unsatisfying for fans of the character&#39;s portrayal so far.

With Rhino&#39;s death in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 currently being non-canon until stated otherwise, there is room for him to potentially return in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3. Whether he does or not, with a vengeful Norman Osborn&#39;s transformation into the Green Goblin seeming somewhat inevitable, and Otto Octavius having plans to get back at his former mentee, Peter Parker, the heroes are going to have plenty to deal with in the next installment.
