## Literature Review

The tools that are available in Cities: Skylines 2 can help talented and creative players make some truly magnificent builds in the game.




Cities: Skylines 2 provides a considerable amount of tools that enable players to build and create unique cities or attempt to recreate places from the real world in the game that can be intricately detailed. The city-planning game is intricately crafted to provide beautiful graphics and an AI for things like traffic patterns and even individual sims walking around the world, giving it a sense of realism. The large skyscrapers, unique special buildings, and the Developer Mode tools give users the ability to be as artistic as they want, or simply play the game and let the city build itself as it will.
Currently, Cities: Skylines 2 is still very new, having just been released on October 24, 2023, and with the amount of concepts and mechanics to figure out in the game, there are not too many examples just yet of spectacular creations. That being said, many have still been working on getting to know this city-building simulator while flexing their creative muscles to come up with some impressive builds. There will certainly be even more impressive works to come in the future, but for now, there are still plenty of builds that deserve some recognition.

The official Discord server for Cities: Skylines 2 is very active and has places where players can show off images of their cities as well as share file saves of their games. NameInvalid was kind enough to share these very impressive images of their city dubbed &#34;Potato City&#34; which shows off how beautiful the game can be as well as a beautiful park in the downtown area.
            
 
 Every Fix Coming To Cities: Skylines 2 After Release 
The PC release of Cities: Skylines 2 is seeing a lot of performance issues that are disappointing to players, here is what is coming to fix this.









 9  Winter City In Cities: Skylines 2 
ElektroTekCity On X
        

This winter scene of a sprawling city in Cities: Skylines 2 looks as though it could be a painting on someone&#39;s wall. The lovely placement of the different zoning areas and roads along the river is picture-perfect. The city is the creation of ElektroTekCity who shared the images on X, along with several others of the scene.


There are many ways that the streets and zoning of buildings can be placed in Cities: Skylines 2, and although ElektroTekCity makes this look easy, it would be hard to duplicate such a peaceful and realistic scene.





 8  150K Population City 
LuftySK On Cities: Skylines Discord
        

Another example of a city that was shared on the Cities: Skylines 2 Discord is this one by LuftySK. LuftySK shared these images of their 150K population city, although they sadly did not say what the name of the city is. The way that the road lines up with the tower is magnificent and the entire look of the build is artistic and pleasing. This is a city that feels realistic as well as very nicely planned out.





 7  Growing Metropolis In Winter

On Instagram, NickyScriptz shared this image of a sprawling Metropolis in Cities: Skylines 2 during the winter. The river and towering skyscrapers clustered in the center of the city look reminiscent of an actual city that one would see in real life. Spreading out further from the center of town, there are subdivisions that extend for large distances, organized neatly in planned-out blocks.

 6  Impressive Roads And Intersections 
Sdanwolf On X


 







X user Sdanwolf used the tools in Cities: Skylines 2 to develop amazing roadways and intersections that have fluidity and movement to the roads that feel both natural and elegant. The use of roundabouts and roads that go over and under each other makes this city feel like a work of art. The photo mode in Cities: Skylines 2 and the lighting at night and reflecting off the water add to the beauty shown here.





 5  Hong Kong Inspired Fortuna City 
PanlopW On X
        

PanlopW from X was given the opportunity to create a Hong Kong-inspired city for the Cities: Skylines 2 release trailer and came up with the creation of what they have named Fortuna City with many Asian influences.


In the above video, they take a tour through the exquisite city of Fortuna and elegantly show the different ways that Cities: Skylines 2 provides tools that allow talented people like PanlopW to create amazing and realistic places.





 4  Canal City 
Teddy Radko On X
        

Teddy Radko created a city built over canals to create a look that is very pleasing to the eye and draws the focus on the large church-like structure on the central island. This Canal City was shared by Teddy Radko on X, where they shared in a comment that they achieved the look by using roads with retaining walls. It is a very creative design idea that permitted them to get a truly unique look for their city.





 3  Classic Metropolis 
MrMaison On X
        

MrMaison on X shared this screenshot of their very first city for Cities: Skylines 2, which looks like a flyover of a real city. The build is very large, but MrMaison states in a comment that they have been lucky enough to not have any performance issues with the game. With so much going on in this image, it can be hard to see, but the roadways and zoning for these buildings are impressively crafted to provide a natural road pattern that not only makes sense from a city-planning perspective but uses the natural curves of the water.
            
 
 Your PC Can’t Run Cities: Skylines 2 Because It Has Too Many Teeth 
Cities: Skylines 2 is struggling to maintain a stable FPS on many systems. One explanation for its performance issues is a bit ridiculous.









 2  Beautiful Plaza In Westdale 2 
PHTN Gaming On X


 







Westdale 2 and another unnamed city are shown in the above images shared by PHTNGaming on X. The layout of PHTN Gaming&#39;s cities are clean and organized, with plenty of spaces for parks, such as the elegant plaza shown above. The amount of trees and green spaces in Westdale 2 will likely look beautiful in each part of the year to make full use of Cities: Skylines 2&#39;s visible changes for each season.





 1  Norway Inspired Sunlandet 
Teddy Radko On X And YouTube
        

Teddy Radko makes another appearance in this list, with the Norwegian-inspired Sundlandet city that was commissioned for part of the launch trailer of Cities: Skylines 2. Teddy also included a virtual video tour of Sundlandet on their YouTube channel for a better look at the intricate details that are artistically placed in the layout and architecture of the city.


There are many tools built into the game to help players design the city of their dreams, whether modeled after real-world places or designed for artistic creativity. Soon there will also be a new Paradox Mods program that will give even more accessibility to talented members of the community to build on the foundation that Cities: Skylines 2 has laid to design even more incredible civilizations.
