## Literature Review

Yoda may have left Luke all too soon, but there&#39;s so much more to explore with the diminutive green Jedi Master in the world of Star Wars.




Yoda&#39;s involvement in the original Star Wars trilogy may have been short and sweet, but the upcoming Minecraft DLC Star Wars: Path of the Jedi could be set to offer up some quality time with the wizened Jedi. This isn&#39;t the first collaboration between Mojang&#39;s sandbox game and a galaxy far, far away, with a previous Minecraft mash-up pack focusing on settings and characters from the original trilogy and the Disney&#43; series The Mandalorian. Star Wars: Path of the Jedi sets its sights on the prequels instead, diving headfirst into the last days of the Republic for a proper gameplay experience.




Minecraft crossover DLC has become an increasingly major part of the game over the years, although few of the expansions can claim the same incredible level of cultural cachet as Star Wars. A variety of Star Wars skin packs fill out the overall roster of collaborations, but Star Wars: Path of the Jedi is the first to deliver more than just resources. The newfound focus on story and gameplay follows up on recent DLC, like Minecraft x Dungeons &amp; Dragons, making Minecraft a home for official adventures of every sort.

                  Every Class In Minecraftâ€™s Dungeons &amp; Dragons DLC   The Dungeons &amp; Dragons DLC for Minecraft adds a selection of iconic classes to the game, but it isn&#39;t based on the lineup of any particular edition.

The prequel era is a ripe setting to explore for fans of the Jedi order, and the Minecraft DLC Star Wars: Path of the Jedi delivers on the promise of its name by keeping the focus on memorable Jedi characters. Perhaps none of these are more iconic than Yoda, who made a huge impression from the moment he first appeared in Return of the Jedi and upset all of Luke Skywalker&#39;s expectations of what a wise Jedi master would be. A tweet about Star Wars: Path of the Jedi from the official Star Wars account highlights his involvement, mentioning &#34;a special mission with Yoda&#34; as a feature of the Minecraft DLC.

Getting to work alongside Yoda is definitely a major draw, as the films never get to explore this angle to a fully satisfying degree. Luke meets Yoda at the end of his life and receives an unfortunately brief crash course in the Jedi way, although Yoda certainly imparts a fair share of wisdom in that amount of time, albeit with an often droll delivery. Anakin ultimately gets more time with the Jedi Master across the course of the prequels and The Clone Wars, but he&#39;s more frequently paired with characters like Obi-Wan and Ahsoka.




                  Best Star Wars Game Protagonists (Who Aren&#39;t Cal Kestis Or Kyle Katarn)   Cal Kestis and Kyle Katarn are certainly cool, but there have been plenty of other great Star Wars video game protagonists over the years.   

The Minecraft mission with Yoda takes players to a planet called Torren, where the Jedi Master senses the presence of the dark side of the Force. Exploration of the planet eventually reveals some mysterious temples and dangerous presences, which must be explored and conquered to triumph over the Star Wars: Path of the Jedi DLC. Along the way, Yoda offers occasional snippets of Jedi wisdom, couched in his familiar twisting of linguistic structure. Throughout all of this, watching his diminutive figure scuttle along expansive Minecraft environments is capable of evoking the purest kind of joy.

Yoda might be the standout of the Star Wars: Path of the Jedi roster, but he isn&#39;t the only memorable Jedi figure taking on blocky Minecraft form. The trailer features a brief clip of an assembled Jedi High Council, with other figures like Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, and Shaak Ti showing up. Even more significant are Mace Windu and, of course, Obi-Wan Kenobi, wielding their purple and blue lightsabers. Although the focus of the DLC isn&#39;t on any of these characters, it&#39;s nice to see them included, as well as an appearance from Anakin Skywalker himself.

Yoda isn&#39;t the only Jedi to offer up a mission as a Star Wars: Path of the Jedi task, although his quest is the most extensive in the Minecraft DLC. Anakin&#39;s adventure takes place on a Dreadnought cruiser, featuring plenty of lightsaber combat with droids of various types. Obi-Wan offers up a challenge to find and pacify a creature on Felucia, the fungal planet of the Outer Rim that has appeared in Revenge of the Sith, The Clone Wars, Battlefront 2, and more. Mace Windu enlists help for a wave survival battle in the rainy environment of Kamino.




Star Wars: Path of the Jedi focuses on Jedi gameplay, with lightsaber swinging and advanced acrobatics defining the combat experience in the Minecraft DLC. Battles feature encounters with storied foes like General Grievous, Darth Maul, and Count Dooku, as well as the more typical cannon fodder enemies that populate the world of Star Wars. This all makes for a generally transformative experience compared to typical Minecraft, although the style and core aspects of movement and design remain intact.

It would be difficult to truly fulfill a Jedi fantasy without getting to enjoy the exceptionally cool tech of the role, and the earliest parts of the Star Wars: Path of the Jedi DLC for Minecraft focus on personalizing these aspects. Lightsaber construction starts with Kyber crystal selection, which makes picking the color possible, followed by an astromech building experience with a variety of body designs and patterns. It&#39;s easy to speed through these parts to get to the action, but taking time to enjoy them helps make things feel authentic.




Star Wars: Path of the Jedi ultimately isn&#39;t a long experience, although it does manage to pack a strong variety of settings and gameplay into its brief runtime. Above all else, however, it spends a good chunk of its time with Yoda, which is exactly where it should be spent. Of all the great moments in Star Wars, few can compete with anything that happens on Dagobah, and Star Wars: Path of the Jedi makes it possible to go on a Minecraft mission with the Jedi Master in a way that Luke Skywalker could only ever dream of.
