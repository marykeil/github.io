 10 Best Meta Quest 2 RPGs Right Now 
The Meta Quest 2 might not seem like the obvious destination for RPGs, but it&#39;s collected a diverse library of engaging titles in the genre.












 








 10  The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Is Horror Action 
Skydance Interactive, 2020


 







The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners is an action game first and foremost, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it entirely forsakes the horror possibilities of the zombie genre. Unlike Arizona Sunshine, another popular VR zombie shooter, Saints &amp; Sinners has plenty of interest in a tense and fearful atmosphere. It&#39;s not one of the scariest VR experiences out there, but there&#39;s still plenty to appreciate throughout the course of its adventure.





 9  The Exorcist: Legion VR Isn&#39;t A Cash Grab 
Wolf &amp; Wood Interactive Ltd, 2017
        

Dragging The Exorcist back into the limelight for franchise opportunities doesn&#39;t always ensure a quality product, as most viewers of the recent The Exorcist: Believer might attest. The Exorcist: Legion VR, however, does a respectable job building on that world to provide genuine fear. With a carefully tuned mix of creepy moments and actual jump scares, this is more than just a cash-grab tie-in on the Meta Quest 2 and 3.

 8  Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife Is Ghostly Fun 
Fast Travel Games, 2021


 







Ghost-hunting is a fairly common feature in horror games, but Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife turns things on their head by putting the player into the undead role. This intriguing premise is served well by a few unique mechanics that take advantage of ghostly abilities, most notably phasing through walls. Uncovering the overall story is a rewarding experience, and well-balanced difficulty makes it a consistently engaging time.





 7  AFFECTED: The Manor Has Haunted House Spooks 
Fallen Planet Studios, 2017
        

AFFECTED: The Manor has always been a cool experience, but it traditionally wasn&#39;t much more than a basic haunted house walkthrough. This was great for showing to friends, but it didn&#39;t offer much in the way of replayability. With the more recent addition of additional modes, however, the game is a more complete package than ever before, and taking on some generated arrays of spooks or challenging speedruns gives it significantly greater longevity.





 6  Lies Beneath Carves Out A Strong Niche 
Drifter, 2020
        

Unique art styles don&#39;t crop up especially often in VR, so the cel-shaded look of Lies Beneath definitely helps set it apart from other Meta Quest horror offerings. That&#39;s not the only thing it does right, however, with a strong atmosphere, compelling combat, and a healthy dose of puzzles to create a diverse gameplay experience. A college student named Mae returning to a small town might sound an awful lot like Night in the Woods, but Lies Beneath goes in a much, much scarier direction.





 5  Cosmodread Is A Horror Roguelike 
White Door Games, 2021
        

Cosmodread has a very different flavor from most horror games on the Quest 2 and 3, utilizing a setting and tone more like Dead Space than classic haunted house fare. The goal is to escape a spaceship full of threats, with a healthy dose of roguelike elements that lend the game significant replayability. With immersive interactions and an emphasis on player strategy, Cosmodread is one of the strongest VR horror experiences out there.





 4  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted Has Scares 
Steel Wool Studios, 2019
        

The Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s name is sure to be an immediate draw for some, while others might be more exhausted by its constant media presence than anything. Regardless of opinions on the franchise as a whole, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted is one of the best VR horror experiences. The jump scare focus translates exceptionally well to the Meta Quest 2 and 3, and it arguably rises above any other franchise entries as a result.





 3  Dreadhalls Has A Terrifying Atmosphere 
White Door Games, 2019
        

Developed by the same studio as Cosmodread, Dreadhalls features simpler gameplay but potentially even better scares. This dungeon-crawler achieves a similarly oppressive atmosphere to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, making fear a constant companion in a way that few titles can manage. Dreadhalls has been around for much longer than its official debut on the Quest store, originally premiering in the earlier days of Oculus, but it certainly holds up.





 2  Resident Evil 4 Is A Classic In VR 
Armature Studio, 2021


 







Resident Evil 4 is frequently mentioned as one of the best survival horror games of all time, and the VR version available on Meta Quest 2 and 3 doesn&#39;t drop the ball. This isn&#39;t just a basic VR port, with a number of features and gameplay elements being reworked to fit perfectly into new control schemes and modes of interaction. Agent Leon S. Kennedy&#39;s mission is just as compelling as it&#39;s always been, and fans and newcomers to Resident Evil 4 alike can get plenty out of the experience.





 1  Propagation: Paradise Hotel Does It All 
WanadevStudio, 2023
        

Propagation: Paradise Hotel is perfect proof that the VR horror genre hasn&#39;t lost its momentum, as this 2023 title is one of the best yet. It doesn&#39;t shy away from using zombies to their full extent, with plenty of gore and surprises that avoid the more rote tendencies of the genre. Propagation: Paradise Hotel isn&#39;t especially long, but the virtual reality experience that&#39;s there is hard to beat on the Meta Quest 2 and 3.
