# One Mysterious Part Of Red Dead Redemption 2 Is Still Scarier Than Most Horror Games


## SUMMARY 



  RDR2 has creepy supernatural elements like UFOs, cannibals, and vampires, but they are kept at a distance and open to interpretation.   There is a mysterious Manmade Mutant in the game, made up of various animals&#39; parts, and evidence to suggest its creator intended to resurrect it.   The Mutant was probably meant to be a fully animated and interactive NPC, but this quest was likely cut from the game.

## Literature Review

RDR2 usually keeps its supernatural elements at arm’s length, but one mystery is truly terrifying. Here’s how to find it, and how it came to be.




The Wild West can be a scary place in Red Dead Redemption 2. Overall, RDR2 is pretty grounded in reality. However, there are lots of little Easter eggs and secrets that touch on the supernatural. There&#39;s nothing akin to RDR1&#39;s zombie adventure DLC Undead Nightmare, but there are UFOs, cannibals, and vampires to be found in RDR2.




But all these horrific elements are kept at arm&#39;s length. The UFO is only visible in the distant sky. The cannibals are only interacted with briefly. And it&#39;s left open to interpretation whether RDR2&#39;s Saint Denis vampire is actually a bloodsucking creature of the night, or just some pale weirdo. However, one secret remains pretty creepy, even a few years after release. Its basis in real-world horrors, along with a closer look at the game&#39;s code, only makes it scarier.

                  Hidden Red Dead Redemption 2 Detail Hints At America&#39;s Tragic Past   Red Dead Redemption 2 contains a touching tribute to an often-forgotten part of American history. Here’s how to find it (and what it means).   


 RDR2’s Manmade Mutant Is Still A Mystery 


 
         

As Arthur explores the area west of the Van Horn Trading Post, he may encounter a decrepit house containing RDR2&#39;s greatest horror: the Manmade Mutant. At first glance, it resembles a crucified minotaur: a humanoid body with a boar&#39;s head, ram&#39;s horns - wait, are those wings? As it turns out, the Manmade Mutant doesn&#39;t seem to contain any human parts at all. It&#39;s all cobbled together of various animals&#39; appendages, with the stomach of a sheep, the forelegs of a bear, and the wings of a vulture. It appears to be strapped to some sort of surgical table, and its arms are suspended from the ceiling in an outstretched position.




Notes found nearby suggest that the creature is the result of scientific experimentation. They read, &#34;The Creature is ready. Parts are currently on ice, prepped for surgery. Any day now...Immensa Creatura.&#34; This seems to imply that whoever created the creature intended to resurrect it. They also reveal that the creator has done even more patchwork than is immediately visible: a bear&#39;s heart beats inside its chest, and its skull is half-human, half-boar.

If they interact with it, Arthur or John will sketch the Mutant in their journal. That&#39;s the extent of the Mutant&#39;s interactivity, though; other than drawing it, there&#39;s nothing Arthur or John can do. However, the fire inside its house is lit, suggesting its creator isn&#39;t far off. And data hidden in the game&#39;s code suggests the mutant might once have walked the earth.



 RDR2 Code Details Suggest The Mutant Was Supposed To Be Alive 
          




A video posted to YouTube by Nestan depicts a hacked copy of RDR2, in which the Manmade Mutant is fully animated, voiced, and responsive like the average RDR2 NPC. This means that vestiges of a walking, talking character exist in its code - it wasn&#39;t always intended to be the static model that players see in-game.

This was probably another RDR2 side quest cut from the final version of the game. Exactly why remains to be seen, but there is in-game evidence of one possible reason. The Manmade Mutant Easter egg bears many similarities to RDR2&#39;s &#34;Artificial Intelligence&#34; side quest, in which players help scientist Marko Dragic build and operate a lifelike, humanoid robot. The Mutant&#39;s quest may have been cut from the game, so it could avoid repeating itself. Dragic&#39;s quest even takes explicit inspiration from the same literary source as the Manmade Mutant.






 


 RDR2&#39;s Manmade Mutant Is Based On A Real-Life Experiment 
How An Italian Polymath And A British Novel Influenced RDR2
          

RDR2&#39;s Manmade Mutant is based on the real-world research of Luigi Galvani, an 18th-century Italian physicist and biologist who pioneered the concept of animal electricity. Galvani discovered, perhaps inadvertently, that the legs of dead frogs contracted or convulsed when electrical currents were applied to them. He believed this was due to an inherent electric current in all muscle tissue of living things, and that this current was the cause of all biological movement. Galvani spent much of his life trying to prove this hypothesis.

Meanwhile, his rival, Alessandro Volta, contended that the muscle contractions were the result of contact with metal surfaces - the wires Galvani used to conduct the current. Volta was eventually proven correct, but still named the nascent science galvanism in his rival&#39;s honor. Galvani&#39;s nephew, Giovanni Aldini, continued his uncle&#39;s research in the same vein. Aldini was the first to apply the science of galvanism to the human body, using the corpse of an executed prisoner in an 1803 demonstration. However, neither Galvani, Volta, nor Aldini attempted to use cobbled-together human parts in their experiments. That was a later invention.




                  RDR3 Fan Map Looks Like A Perfect Prequel, But Is Missing One Key Location   A fan-made map for Red Dead Redemption 3 suggests taking the series in a new direction, but that’d mean leaving a couple of iconic locations behind.   

The story for the 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus was famously conceived by an 18-year-old Mary Shelley as she, her husband Percy, her stepsister Claire, and the poet Lord Byron spent a holiday on Byron&#39;s estate in Geneva. Shuttered indoors by bad weather, the four writers traded ghost stories, and Mary&#39;s, about a mad scientist who breathes life back into the dead, won the contest. She later adapted this story into the timeless novel - although her original work made no mention of Dr. Frankenstein using electricity to resurrect his monster. That was an addition of later film adaptations.

Shelley directly admitted that she was inspired by Galvani&#39;s work. She may have heard of Aldini&#39;s work in England while he lived there. She may have even seen animal electricity in practice. Her husband&#39;s tutor, James Lind, had studied galvanism, and frequently gave demonstrations on the subject. Percy was known to be interested in animal electricity, and it&#39;s no stretch to assume that Mary may have accompanied him to a lecture or two.




Galvani&#39;s work and Shelley&#39;s invention were all tied together to create the Manmade Mutant. Of course, RDR2&#39;s resident reanimated corpse takes things a step further, combining parts from multiple different species to create a wholly chimeric organism.

It&#39;s a shame that the full intended version of the Manmade Mutant doesn&#39;t appear in RDR2. It might be nice to see what kind of quest it tied into, or how it handled itself in combat. However, it still makes for a creepy detail on its own. It&#39;s arguably more frightening that the final version of the Manmade Mutant isn&#39;t ever explained. Odd, inexplicable details like this one are a major part of what makes Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s world feel alive.
