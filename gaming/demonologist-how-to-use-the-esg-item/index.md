## Literature Review

An item called an ESG can reveal hidden ghosts in Demonologist for a very brief time, giving you a crucial piece of evidence against specific spirits.





According to the ESG&#39;s item description, it is used to &#34;raise the energy of paranormal entities to display the ghost itself&#34; on top of the device. This makes the ESG one of the best equipment pieces to buy first in Demonologist since it shows you exactly what you and your team are against. The only downside to this item is how precise it can be as you try to find the right spot to place it inside a haunted house.

 Where To Place The ESG Device In Demonologist 
          

You have to place the ESG device where there is the most ghost activity, which carries a lot of risk for your character. Standing directly next to any spirit will quickly lower your sanity, making this a sacrifice for more knowledge. Once you put down the ESG, keep looking at it until a figure briefly appears over the device, which counts as evidence you may use even if you can barely make out what the image was.



Placing items can be a little awkward in Demonologist, but thankfully, it does not matter what direction you place the ESG as long as it exists inside the same room with the most ghost activity.






 How To Keep Using the ESG Device In Demonologist 
          




If you find that your character is losing their sanity too quickly from watching the ESG, turn on the lights in the room with the ghost if you can. When this isn&#39;t a viable option, eat some sanity pills you can buy for your loadout before even approaching the haunted house. Keep in mind that items are expensive in Demonologist, with nearly everything costing well over $1,000.



Those who have spent the least money on their team&#39;s equipment should be the ones watching the ESG since they have more money to afford sanity recovery items.




When activated by a ghost, the ESG will let off a low, distorted noise that should signal that it has captured evidence of a ghost. Different tasks, like finding cursed items in Demonologist, will appear based on the evidence collected from the device. Eight different spirit types can be correctly identified using the ESG in Demonologist, including:

  Iblis: A talkative ghost that uses words the other ghosts do not.   Deogen: A ghost that chooses one target out of a group and is more likely to hunt that player than the others.   Naahmah: A &#34;thief ghost&#34; that prefers to stay in the dark while it relocates tools your team could use.   Guipo: A ghost resembling a friendly old woman who prefers to stay in their favorite room. This spirit supposedly only initiates a hunt outside that favorite space.   Jinn: A ghost that lowers sanity when it throws objects. It is more likely to interact with objects than other ghosts.   Goryo: A rare ghost that doesn&#39;t interact with the ESG device when players are nearby.   Boogey: A ghost similar to the Poltergeist who throws items around. This spirit likes to target a single player based on how low their sanity is.   Yurei: A ghost that hunts more frequently when players travel in groups.  




No matter what type of ghost appears when you use the ESG device in Demonologist, you&#39;ll need to be ready to take the right risks after the item works to banish the evil lurking within the haunted house your team explores.
