# Marvels Spider-Man 2 Changed A Huge Venom Detail From The Comics


## SUMMARY 



  Insomniac Games&#39; Spider-Man 2 takes inspiration from various media to craft its own spin on the Venom saga.   In the game, the symbiotes do not have the same weaknesses as in other media. While they are still vulnerable to high-frequency sounds, they are immune to fire, which is a departure from traditional symbiote weaknesses.   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 - maybe unintentionally - introduces an additional weakness for the symbiotes: water. In gameplay, Spider-Man can throw symbiotes into lakes or rivers, instantly destroying the symbiote and freeing its host.

## Literature Review

The Spider-Men finally face the fan-favorite villain, Venom in Spider-Man 2, but the symbiote doesn&#39;t have as many weaknesses as in other media.




Peter Parker and Miles Morales&#39; Spider-Men finally face the fan-favorite villain, Venom in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. The arrival of the Venom symbiote had been teased since the first Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s post-credits scene, and Insomniac Games has taken inspiration from various media and made changes of its own to craft its own spin on the Venom saga.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2]Insomniac&#39;s Venom story starts off with elements familiar to fans of both the Ultimate Spider-Man comics and the TV show of the same name. The suit is used as a way to treat diseases - as it was in the comics - and bonds with Harry Osborn as it did in the TV show. This was used to tell a story that was far more personal for Peter and Mary Jane, as defeating Venom could result in the loss of a close friend, as Harry was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the suit was the only thing keeping him alive. Later in the game, however, Insomniac took more from Donny Cates&#39; Venom comics in its designs of a winged Venom, and by showing Venom taking command of an army of symbiotes.



As the symbiote invasion spreads across New York in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s third act, the symbol found on the symbiotes and the icon for their nests is that of the Symbiote God, Knull, who was also created as part of Cates&#39; Venom run.

 What Are The Symbiotes&#39; Weaknesses? 
Symbiotes Have Had Several Weaknesses Over The Years
         

When the Venom symbiote was first introduced in 1984, it appeared as a new suit for Peter Parker after his old one was destroyed during the Secret Wars comic arc. It was only after he returned home and studied it with the likes of Mr. Fantastic that he came to discover it was alive and was corrupting Peter and changing his behavior for the worse. In the years that followed, Spider-Man media has explored the symbiote&#39;s weaknesses, with the main two being vulnerability to intense sounds and heat.

Other stories have introduced other man-made weaknesses, such as chemical dopamine inhibitors that could keep symbiotes in check, and Tony Stark once transformed Dr. Doom&#39;s virus-like biological organisms from being a bioweapon into a symbiote antidote. There is also the element of the symbiote that requires the chemical phenethylamine to survive, which is often found in chocolate and human brain tissue. This has resulted in Venom having some cannibalistic traits in some media and is often used as one of the main causes of Eddie Brock and Venom&#39;s bickering in the Venom movies.






 Fire Doesn&#39;t Hurt The Symbiote In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
Symbiotes Have Fewer Weaknesses In Insomniac&#39;s Story
          

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 makes it clear that its depiction of the symbiote would not have the same weaknesses as it does in other media fairly early on. In one sequence, Peter and Harry - who is wearing the symbiote in an Agent Venom-inspired look - infiltrate one of Kraven&#39;s lairs in a Steel Mill to rescue a reformed Tombstone. The Steel Mill is understandably extremely hot with large fires and vats of molten metal around. Long-term Venom fans were likely expecting to see some kind of reaction from Harry to this intense heat, but Peter outright asks Harry if the fire bothers him, and he says he doesn&#39;t even feel it.

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s Senior Creative Director, Bryan Intihar discussed the symbiote&#39;s immunity to fire in an episode of IGN&#39;s Beyond podcast. Intihar stated that the symbiotes having several weaknesses posed a problem for the team, as they discussed how they would be able to convey all of them in the story. Therefore, the decision was made to streamline Venom&#39;s weaknesses down to just high-frequency sounds instead.





 

These high-frequency sounds can be seen impacting the symbiote in cutscenes such as Peter&#39;s confrontation with Kraven in the church in which he rings the bell and first spots this weakness, as well as when Lizard roars during his fight with a symbiote-enhanced Peter. It is also used in gameplay as Miles uses a bell to weaken the suit&#39;s hold on Peter in a Spider-Man v Spider-Man boss fight, and later through an upgraded sonic gadget.



The church bell sequence is a nod to other Spider-Man media such as the classic Amazing Spider-Man comics, the 90s animated Spider-Man show, and the Spider-Man 3 movie where Peter goes to a church bell tower to remove the suit himself after seeing how much it&#39;s corrupting him.




One whole side plot would likely have had to be changed if the symbiotes were weakened by fire, as the leader of the pyro-obsessed cult, &#34;The Flame&#34; is shown to be seeking a symbiote of his own by the end of a series of side-missions. This leader was revealed to be Cletus Kasady, who escapes with the symbiote that is inevitably going to transform him into Carnage. If the symbiotes couldn&#39;t handle fire, being surrounded by people who use it as their primary weapon wouldn&#39;t be an ideal situation.




                  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2: Every Villain Confirmed &amp; Teased So Far   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 will see Peter and Miles taking on a variety of different villains over the course of the game&#39;s campaign.   



 How Have Symbiotes&#39; Weaknesses Been Approached In Other Games? 
Venom And Other Symbiotes Have Appeared In Many Spider-Man Games
         

Venom and the symbiotes have had a long history of appearing in games, and their weaknesses have been approached in different ways. The 2000 Spider-Man game had a fire web-cartridge pickup that was made by Peter mixing his webbing with Magnesium to create a chemical reaction. This could be used in the later missions to fight symbiotes, but other than the boss battle against Carnage in the penultimate level of that game, their weaknesses to certain frequencies weren&#39;t explored.



Players can knock Carnage into a sonic bubble to quickly lower his health bar in Spider-Man (2000).







In Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, S.H.I.E.L.D. did use similar forcefields to the aforementioned sonic bubble to protect bases, but the symbiotes&#39; weaknesses weren&#39;t explored much in combat. Spider-Man could swap between the traditional red and blue suit and the black symbiote at any time in that game, evening the odds as he fought them on the ground, in the air, and on walls, although he didn&#39;t use any additional sonic or fire gadgets to assist in defeating them, likely due to wearing his own symbiote.

The 2007 Spider-Man 3 movie tie-in only had players fighting Venom once in the final boss battle of the game that took place on a construction site. In this sequence, they could attack certain items like stacks of metal poles to emit a ringing sound that could stun Venom and provide a window to deal damage. However, outside of this, his weakness was shown more through cutscenes than in combat.

Ultimate Spider-Man showed a different kind of weakness for Venom, as players could take control of Venom throughout the game and could see that the suit was eating Eddie Brock alive through a constantly depleting health bar, forcing him to &#34;consume&#34; civilians and enemies around the city. Silver Sable and her mercenaries also had special equipment to combat him, but this did not seem to be related to sonic frequencies or fire. Even in the final boss battle of that game, the rooftop of Trask Tower was on fire, and this seemed to have no impact on Venom.




                  What Happens To Venom &amp; The Symbiote In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Venom and the Symbiote are a core narrative component in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but what really happens to it throughout the duration of the game?   



 Spider-Man 2 Gives The Symbiotes An Additional Weakness 
Spider-Man 2&#39;s Symbiotes&#39; New Weakness May Be Unintentional
          

In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Peter and Miles upgrade their grenade-type Concussion Burst gadget to emit a powerful sonic wave to stun the symbiotes, and the Anti-Venom suit Peter gets toward the end of the story also severely weakens the symbiotes in combat. However, while the symbiotes may be immune to fire in this story, some gameplay moments seem to take this in the completely opposite direction by giving the symbiote enemies some vulnerability to water.

When fighting the symbiotes around the game&#39;s open world, Spider-Man can throw or launch his enemies into lakes or rivers, which seems to instantly destroy the symbiote and free its host, who starts treading water. This is likely because the tactic of throwing enemies into the water or off rooftops - the latter of which sees them conveniently caught by a web gadget to avoid certain death - defeats most enemy types instantly by default in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and its predecessors, but it is an amusing change for those familiar with the symbiotes&#39; weaknesses in other media.
