## Literature Review

The Meta Quest 2 might not seem like the obvious destination for RPGs, but it&#39;s collected a diverse library of engaging titles in the genre.




RPGs might not be the most plentiful genre when it comes to virtual reality availability, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not a selection of strong choices on the Meta Quest 2. Roleplaying games have long been associated with the idea of VR in fiction, as making choices and living out an alternate life in an immersive virtual world has a fascinating appeal. In practice, however, the challenges of VR development can make these lofty ideals somewhat difficult to achieve.
When a VR RPG does manage to stick the landing, it can be a uniquely compelling experience. The best RPGs on the Meta Quest 2 take advantage of the system&#39;s immersive possibilities to render interesting worlds, stories, and action all around the player. These titles cover a variety of subjects and styles, but they all manage to offer something that wouldn&#39;t feel the same on traditional gaming hardware.
            
 
 10 Most Anticipated RPGs Of 2024 
The slate of RPGs in 2024 is already pretty full, and there&#39;s some particularly exciting titles that stand out among the options coming to the table.












 








 10  OrbusVR Is A Quest 2 MMO 
Developer: Orbus Online
        

OrbusVR was the definitive Quest 2 MMO for several years, and although there&#39;s a strong alternative to it today, it&#39;s still an experience with its own unique benefits. That being said, the player base is much smaller than it used to be, and expecting any more frequent updates looks like something of a pipe dream. OrbusVR is worth playing while it still can be, as it doesn&#39;t look like it will last forever.





 9  Ancient Dungeon Is A Unique Blend 
Developer: Eric Thullen
        

Ancient Dungeon might best be qualified as a roguelite overall, but its classic fantasy elements, interesting bosses, and varied equipment options to upgrade give it a reasonable RPG flair. The big standout is the focus on physics, which makes the dungeon-crawling experience feel incredibly unlike the old-school first-person games from which it takes visual inspiration and makes it a good exercise game for the Meta Quest 2. Multiplayer is currently available in beta, adding an extra level of replayability and possibility.





 8  Zenith: The Last City Evolves VR MMOs 
Developer: Ramen VR


 







A proper VR MMO experience is the stuff of dreams, and Zenith: The Last City might have made the furthest strides toward that ideal of any Meta Quest 2 game so far. It&#39;s still fairly new to the market, having first launched in 2022, and active development continues to add new features to the experience. OrbusVR might have a longer legacy, but despite its limitations, Zenith: The Lost City is more active and more exciting today.





 7  Arcaxer Has All The RPG Staples 
Developer: Overrun Games
        

Arcaxer has everything that many players are looking for in a VR RPG, with polished renditions of genre staples like dungeon crawls, boss fights, and plenty of equipment and abilities to discover. Its turn-based combat might not seem like the most exciting choice for VR, but it&#39;s surprisingly dynamic, utilizing a first-person perspective and requiring movement in real space to dodge attacks. Everything is in service of ascending the Stack, a procedurally generated tower that can be a thrill to conquer.





 6  Stones Of Harlath Has First-Person Fun 
Developer: Garage Collective LLC
        

Stones of Harlath isn&#39;t the richest RPG experience, but it&#39;s a nice dungeon crawler to pick up and play after setting up a Meta Quest 2. Pixelated textures and enemy sprites give it a charming retro feel and a better style than many competitors overall, and casting magic by drawing runes makes nice use of VR control opportunities. Melee combat isn&#39;t quite as exciting, but there&#39;s still plenty to enjoy in this Meta Quest 2 adventure.





 5  RUINSMAGUS Is A Dungeon-Crawling JRPG 
Developer: CharacterBank Inc
        

RUINSMAGUS is a great VR choice for fans of JRPGs, with charming art and enough genre staples to make aficionados feel right at home. This includes exclusively Japanese audio, so anyone playing in English will have to get used to reading a lot of subtitles in VR. The dungeons aren&#39;t as impressive or varied as they could be, but there&#39;s enough going on in the immersion and narrative department to mostly make up for it.
            
 
 This Fantasy RPG Might Ease The Wait For The Elder Scrolls 6 
Bethesdaâ€™s highly anticipated next fantasy RPG is still apparently years away, but another game releasing sooner might have some of the same appeal.








 4  Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice Is A Stealth RPG 
Developer: Fast Travel Games
        

Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice slots into the elusive category of fully realized VR games from major franchises, and it carves out a niche from most of that already limited competition by taking on the RPG genre. A lot of the focus is on stealth action, but in keeping with the series as a whole, it features a narrative focus and open-ended possibilities. A choice-based dialogue system and branching skill tree set it apart from something like Assassin&#39;s Creed Nexus VR, making it a Meta Quest 2 game worth considering for any RPG fans.





 3  Demeo Takes The Tabletop To VR 
Developer: Resolution Games


 







Fans of multiplayer Meta Quest 2 experiences can have a lot of fun with Demeo, which replicates the communal joy of tabletop gaming thanks to the advantages of VR. Even better, friends who don&#39;t have headsets can play on a PC or PS5, making it much easier to assemble a proper adventuring party. It&#39;s all about dungeon crawling, with digital dice to toss and charming miniatures to move throughout grid-based environments.





 2  A Township Tale Is A Charming Fantasy 
Developer: Alta
        

A Township Tale is the perfect option for someone looking for classic medieval fantasy on the Meta Quest 2, especially if the cozier aspects of the setting are the biggest appeal. Adventuring across an open world is a great hook for any VR game, and A Township Tale has a good helping of strong mechanics and side activities to support that aim. Crafting gear is necessary to take on the challenge of dungeons, and an update added climbing abilities that give the world an extra dose of verticality.





 1  Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2 Is A Triple A VR Experience 
Developer: Sanzaru Games


 







The original Asgard&#39;s Wrath was one of the more ambitious titles that could be played on the Meta Quest 2, but Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2 takes things to another level entirely. This action RPG features the length and quality of presentation necessary to genuinely compete with major releases on traditional platforms, and the immersive perspective gives it an edge that sets it apart. Anyone looking for one of the most essential Meta Quest 2 titles need look no further than Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2, a virtual reality game that isn&#39;t likely to be forgotten anytime soon.
