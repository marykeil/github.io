 9  I Expect You To Die 
VR Puzzle Game


 







Despite its rather morbid-sounding name, I Expect You To Die is a fun and engaging puzzle game that immerses players in the role of a virtual reality secret agent. Over seven secret missions, Agents have to face challenges to escape dangerous situations and defeat the evil Dr. Zor. It is a well-designed game where the VR focuses on environmental puzzles set before a player feels real, and there is no one answer for solving the mysteries.
I Expect You To Die does not involve the main character moving around, which is helpful for those worried about motion sickness. 






 8  Star Wars: Tales From The Galaxy&#39;s Edge 
VR First-Person Shooter
        

Being a droid repair technician doesn&#39;t sound as though it would be the most exciting of roles to play in the Star Wars universe, yet when a group of pirates attack, things change quickly. In Star Wars: Tales From The Galaxy&#39;s Edge, that is exactly the position that players are put in as they get to fight along with R2-D2, C-3PO, and more on Batuu. The game is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and is an open-world VR Star Wars game that features many of the original actors providing their voices, including Frank Oz as Yoda.





 7  Moss 
VR Adventure Game
        

Moss is a single-player VR game that explores the adventure of a young mouse in a world where ancient magic has been reawakened. Players face challenging puzzles and fight against dangerous enemies while exploring this beautiful realm. One of the more special and immersive features of Moss is that players do not play as Quill but rather play alongside her, even getting to have her interact with them in adorable ways, such as going for a high-five after completing a challenge.





 6  Eye Of The Temple 
VR Adventure And Puzzle Game


 







Eye of the Temple was released in April 2023 and brings a feeling of Indiana Jones to VR gaming experiences. In an immersive world that uses room-scale VR to create a unique experience of navigating space, players get to delve into the depths of a mysterious temple to solve mysteries. The virtual experience includes using a whip to grab levers and fight monsters while moving to dodge obstacles and carefully step onto moving blocks.
Eye of the Temple is a beautiful environment, but it does present some risk of falling over and motion sickness challenges for those susceptible. 






 5  Half-Life: Alyx 
VR First-Person Shooter
        

A malicious race of aliens known as the Combine is threatening the very survival of the human race, and it is up to Alyx Vance to save the day. Half-Life: Alyx is set between Half-Life and Half-Life 2 and is full of world exploration and combat. Being able to physically maneuver to aim around walls or shoot bottles to cause distractions, the game is intricately detailed. Newcomers to the Half-Life series will still be able to appreciate the thrill that this VR experience provides, even without knowing the other games.

Half-Life: Alyx sets new standards for presentation, interactivity, and - crucially - accessibility in VR, even allowing sit-down play.








 4  Epic Roller Coasters 
Roller Coaster VR
        

One of the best experiences that many can feel in a virtual reality game is the sensation that can be physically felt when in a game such as Epic Roller Coasters. The feeling of actually being on a roller coaster but placing those rides in worlds of dinosaurs, magic, or more can be truly exhilarating. For those who want even more excitement, there are different modes available, such as Shooter Mode, where players shoot to hit targets during the ride, and Race Mode to compete for the fastest and wildest time.
If a real roller coaster causes motion sickness for someone, Epic Roller Coasters certainly will also. 






 3  Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2 
VR Action Role-Playing Game
        

Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2 is an ARPG sequel that does not require knowledge of the first game in order to enjoy it. In this epic story, players find that the trickster Loki betrayed them, and now they must fight their way through different landscapes and master the skills of the gods to stop Loki. The massive game includes over 60 hours of story campaign, full of physics-based combat and puzzles.

 2  Walkabout Mini Golf VR 
Virtual Mini Golf


 







Walkabout Mini Golf is a VR experience with eight unique 18-hole mini golf courses that can be enjoyed solo or multiplayer in either a 1v1 online quick match or a private game for up to eight friends. A fun extra in the game is that there are over 188 custom balls hidden in the different courses. Each of the courses is made to feel like a classic mini golf game, but on a grander scale that is not generally possible in real life.
As long as the host player has purchased a paid DLC course, their friends can join them on the course without also buying the DLC. 






 1  Beat Saber 
VR Rhythm Game
        

Beat Saber is one of the older VR games these days, yet remains a favorite for many and is a must-play VR experience. Slashing objects in movement with the beats from a massive soundtrack is often much more challenging than one would expect and is an energizing experience. Even after playing long enough to get physically tired from the exertion, Beat Saber is a game that is hard to put down. With the right equipment, up to five people can attempt a song at once in a multiplayer mode that can add some competition or just for a bit of a virtual dance party.
