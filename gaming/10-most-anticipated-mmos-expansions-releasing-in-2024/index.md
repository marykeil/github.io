## Literature Review

2024 is shaping up to be a great year for MMOs. Here are some of the most anticipated new games and classic MMO expansions expected this year.




Between brand-new releases and expansions to fan favorites like Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft, 2024 is going to be a big year for MMOs. Standing for &#34;massively multiplayer online,&#34; and usually followed with the further qualifier &#34;role-playing games,&#34; MMO is a vast and all-inclusive term that requires just one thing: an interconnected game world that can be inhabited by thousands, if not millions, of players at once. Of course, there are hallmarks of the genre: customizable characters, combo- and placement-based combat, and a ton of grinding tend to be the norm. But an MMO can be anything, as long as it&#39;s shared by a large number of players.
2024&#39;s most anticipated MMOs include strange new worlds, long-awaited sequels, and linear expansions. They span genres from epic sci-fi to classic fantasy to survival horror. Some of them are exclusive to PC, while others are available on a wide variety of consoles. There&#39;s an MMO for everyone in 2024, and these are just some of the most anticipated.
            
 
 WoW: The War Within Highlights A Serious MMO Problem 
Upcoming expansion The War Within is doing something that World of Warcraft hasn&#39;t done before, and it represents a concerning industry trend.












 








 10  Ship Of Heroes Is A Customizable Superhero Sequel 
Coming To PC In 2024
        

Ever wanted to design a custom superhero? Ship of Heroes has got that covered. The sequel to 2004&#39;s City of Heroes, Ship of Heroes is set in the distant future, when humans (and superhumans) have taken to space. Early previews reveal an incredibly robust character creator, and, like its predecessor, a detailed system of superpower customization. Ship of Heroes appeals to the consummate role-player, especially anyone who&#39;s ever doodled their own superhero in the margins of a sheet of notebook paper. It doesn&#39;t have a set release date, but is expected by the end of 2024.





 9  Blue Protocol Is Bandai Namco&#39;s Action MMO 
Coming To PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S In 2024
        

        


  Blue Protocol  

  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , Steam     Developer(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment , Amazon Games     Publisher(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment     Genre(s)    MMORPG , Action RPG , Adventure , Free-to-Play     Multiplayer    Online Multiplayer , Online Co-Op     Engine    Unreal Engine 4     ESRB    T     Mode    Single-player, Multiplayer    


For those who prefer action combat in their MMOs, Blue Protocol might be more their speed. Developed by Bandai Namco, responsible for both the more recent installments in the Tales series and Scarlet Nexus, Blue Protocol has a storied action RPG pedigree. Players can pick from one of five melee, ranged, or magically focused classes as they explore the open world of Regnas, battling monsters and completing quests. Blue Protocol is also rendered in a gorgeously colorful, cel-shaded art style that should make character creation a delight.





 8  Once Human Is A Post-Apocalyptic Survival MMO 
Coming To PC In Q3 2024
        

In Once Human, player characters have transcended their humanity to become something more: powerful Meta-Humans, who can resist the pollution that destroyed the rest of the world. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re immune to it, though; players will need to scrounge up uncontaminated food, water, and supplies to keep themselves alive. The multiplayer element can make or break a game, as players can make friend or foe with anyone else they come across. Once Human held its second beta test in December 2023, and is expected to see a full release by the end of 2024.





 7  Throne And Liberty Promises Large-Scale PvPvE Battles 
Coming To MacOS, PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S
        

        


  Throne and Liberty  


  Platform(s)    PC     Developer(s)    NCSoft     Publisher(s)    Amazon Studios     Genre(s)    MMORPG     ESRB    Not Yet Rated    


Throne and Liberty was originally intended to be a sequel to Lineage, a 1998 MMO developed and published by NCSoft. This was eventually scrapped, with Lineage getting a separate sequel called Lineage W, while the framework of the in-development title was repurposed for an original game, Throne and Liberty. Set in an ever-changing fantasy world, players can participate in enormous, chaotic battles with hundreds of participants, and transform into different animal shapes in order to use their unique abilities. Throne and Liberty still doesn&#39;t have an official release date, but is currently in the process of testing.





 6  Path Of Exile 2 Is A Dark Fantasy Sequel 
Coming To MacOS, PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S
        

        


  Path of Exile 2  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows     Developer(s)    Grinding Gear Games     Publisher(s)    Grinding Gear Games     Genre(s)    Action , RPG     ESRB    M    


The original Path of Exile is a Diablo-style, top-down, dungeon-crawling action RPG. Character classes are incredibly mutable, with a variable system of main classes and subclasses that allows for a wide range of playstyles. Oh, and it&#39;s all free to play - microtransactions exist, but they don&#39;t affect gameplay so much as they are cosmetic customization options. Path of Exile 2 promises more of the same, with a new story, new classes, new weapons, and new locations. It hasn&#39;t announced a release date yet, but has dropped a gameplay preview and multiple gameplay trailers, so a concrete date is probably imminent.





 5  The Elder Scrolls Online Is Getting A New Expansion In 2024 
Coming To MacOS, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, And Xbox Series X/S
        

        


 The Elder Scrolls Online 


  Platforms    Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S     Publishers    Bethesda Softworks     Mode    Single player     Rating    9/10 Steam    


The Elder Scrolls Online has been ongoing since 2014, but it&#39;s set to get its eighth expansion in 2024. No details have been provided about its content at the time of writing, but the grand reveal is currently scheduled to premiere during a spate of major Microsoft announcements on January 18. The next chapter in ESO will probably include another addition to its vast map, sprawling story, and exciting quests. It features more rigid class structures than single-player Elder Scrolls games, but with plenty of personal customization. Besides its main campaign, ESO offers satisfying crafting grinds and thrilling PvP battles.





 4  Guild Wars 2 Also Has An Expansion Planned For 2024 
Coming To PC In 2024
        

        


  Guild Wars 2  


  Franchise    Guild Wars     Platform(s)    PC     Released    August 28, 2012     Developer(s)    ArenaNet     Publisher(s)    ArenaNet , NCSoft     Genre(s)    MMO , RPG     ESRB    T     How Long To Beat    83h 8m    


Like ESO, Guild Wars 2 has been going on for a long time - since 2012, in this case. It&#39;s always been praised for its approachability and wide variety of customization options, and those only grow with the addition of each expansion. Characters may pick from a deep pool of skills, classes, and professions. The next Guild Wars 2 expansion doesn&#39;t have a title yet, but is expected to begin a new story following the conclusion of its Elder Dragon Saga. It was announced in August 2023 for a 2024 release date to be determined.





 3  Dune: Awakening Is The MMO Fans Have Been Waiting For 
Coming To PC, PS5, And Xbox Series X/S


 







        


  Dune: Awakening  

  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Developer(s)    Funcom     Publisher(s)    Funcom     Genre(s)    MMORPG , Survival     Multiplayer    Online Multiplayer     ESRB    Not Yet Rated    


An open-world Dune game is long overdue. Dune: Awakening, based on the series of novels by Frank Herbert, might finally be the video game adaptation the franchise deserves. Set on the harsh desert world of Arrakis, the beating heart of the galaxy&#39;s economic system, it&#39;ll feature both survival and MMO elements as players explore, team up, and fight to survive. Trailers have already featured a number of classic Dune staples: ornithopters, Fremen stillsuits, and, of course, gargantuan sandworms. While little else is known about the game, and it doesn&#39;t have a solid release date yet, some inspiration can be drawn from developer Funcom&#39;s previous survival game, Conan Exiles.





 2  WoW&#39;s The War Within Is The Latest Expansion To A Classic MMO 
Coming To MacOS and PC In 2024


 







        


  World of Warcraft

World of Warcraft has almost two decades under its belt, and is still going strong with new content releases. The upcoming expansion The War Within will be its tenth major update, and there are already two more planned to follow. The War Within raises player level caps to 80, introducing four new map regions and the new Hero Talents customization feature. It&#39;ll also allow players to bring along their alternate characters with the Warbands mechanic, and complete treasure-laden dungeons called Delves.





 1  FFXIV&#39;s Dawntrail Is The Start Of A New Saga 
Coming To MacOS, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, And Xbox Series X/S


 







        


  Final Fantasy 14  


  Franchise    Final Fantasy     Platform(s)    PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Microsoft Windows , macOS     Released    August 27, 2013     Developer(s)    Square Enix     Publisher(s)    Square Enix     Genre(s)    Fantasy , MMORPG     Multiplayer    Online Co-Op , Online Multiplayer     ESRB    T     How Long To Beat    120HOURS    


Dawntrail is the fifth major expansion for the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14. Taking place in a brand-new region, Dawntrail introduces three new jobs to FFXIV: Pictomancer, Viper, and Beastmaster. However, as always with FFXIV, the story is the main focus. Coming hot on the heels of the last expansion, Endwalker, which concluded the Hydaelyn-Zodiark saga, Dawntrail promises to kick off a new adventure with familiar characters, bringing FFXIV into the future. While there&#39;s no definite release date, it has been confirmed for release sometime in 2024.
2024 is shaping up to be a great year for MMOs, with a wide variety of games suited to all players&#39; tastes scheduled for release. While this list isn&#39;t exhaustive - there are certain to be some surprise hits and unexpected delays - these games and expansions are among the most anticipated for 2024. Thanks to their developers&#39; pedigrees, long-running reputations, or promising gameplay, these MMOs have a lot to offer.
