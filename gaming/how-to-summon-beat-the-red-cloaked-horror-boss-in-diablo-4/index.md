## Literature Review

The Midwinter Blight event in Diablo 4 has a new boss you can summon and beat called the Red-Cloaked Horror, whose drops lead to limited time rewards.





You have to travel to a Blighted Revelry event that has a chance to appear on your map of Sanctuary from time to time during this season. Unlike the Beast in Ice Boss in Diablo 4, the Red-Cloaked Horror appears in the open areas of the Fractured Peaks instead of a dungeon. An orange triangle icon on your map will mark the Revelry event&#39;s exact location as you travel across the land.






One of the best ways to get around the Fractured Peaks quickly is to fast travel using Waypoints or use a mount.

 How To Summon The Red-Cloaked Horror 

 

You have to beat the Blighted Revelry event with Mastery to summon the Red-Cloaked Horror in Diablo 4, as seen in the above video from Sliver of time. The only way to do this is to defend a burning wagon&#39;s fire from enemies and beat every foe in under 2 minutes. The main creatures you have to beat are named Frigid Husks, who awaken after the flames of the wagon start to heat the cold wastelands in the Fractured Peaks.






The level of the Blighted Revelry event depends on what World Tier your character is playing on and the overall level of the character. The Red-Cloaked Horror and the enemies that come before are harder to defeat if you have an absurdly strong character.




The Frigid Husks will attack as soon as the wagon catches fire, but they are guarded by waves of enemy minions that can be overwhelming. Every hostile creature in this area will attempt to extinguish the flames since the Husks become invulnerable if the fire is put out. If you take down every Husk within the time limit, the Red-Cloaked Horror will be summoned right away in Diablo 4.

                  How To Summon Echo of Varshan In Diablo 4   One of the endgame bosses in Season 2 of Diablo 4, the Echo of Varshan, must be summoned by collecting or crafting body parts from the undead monster.   



 How To Defeat the Red-Cloaked Horror 
          




There are several ways to defeat the Red-Cloaked Horror, but the best strategies are to destroy the Ice Pillars the boss creates and dodge their attacks when you can Evade. The Horror has a massive Axe and power over ice magic to damage your character through melee strikes and Area of Effect (AoE) abilities. Depending on your build, protecting yourself from this creature&#39;s moves in Diablo 4 may be difficult.

  Red-Cloaked Horror Move List    Attack   Description   How to Beat    Ice Axe   The Red-Cloaked Horror jumps into the air before slamming their axe into the ground for a powerful melee attack. A wave of ice bursts from the weapon after the attack to slow your character and deal extra damage.   Move to the side of the boss to avoid the initial strike, then Dodge to either side to move away from the ice.    Frozen Orbs   Several orbs burst from the Red-Cloaked Horror, traveling at different angles forward around the boss. These attacks have a chance to slow down your character if they get hit.   Stay away from the Horror and move between the gaps in between each orb fired from the boss.    Pillars of Frost   The Red-Cloaked Horror creates multiple Pillars of Frost around the arena that explode after a short period of time. This AoE attack has a chance to Freeze your character.   Destroy the Pillars after they spawn; you will have a few moments to break them before they explode. Stay out of range of the burst AoE if some Pillars remain for the explosion.   





When your character is Frozen, they cannot move, use Skills, or drink Potions for a few seconds. This could result in your character&#39;s death, so avoid any chance of this occurring during the boss fight.







One of the best items to bring into this fight is an Elixir of Cold Resistance crafted by the Alchemist vendors found across Diablo 4. All the Red-Cloaked Horror&#39;s attacks are tied to ice magic, making this potion an incredible way to reduce the damage your character takes throughout the battle. Use your Healing Potions and Evade Skill wisely to avoid the boss&#39;s deadliest attacks.



 Rewards For Beating The Red-Cloaked Horror 
          

Your character earns a lot of rare loot for beating the Red-Cloaked Horror, but the Red-Cloaked Trophy is the exclusive prize directly from this boss. This item does not let you create one of the most OP builds in Diablo 4 with no significant effects. However, you can trade the Trophy at a Collection&#39;s Table for Midwinter Proof currency tied to the Midwinter Blight event.




Midwinter Proof is essentially your Gold for a character named Gileon, found in Kyovashad during the seasonal event. This figure sells themed items around the holiday season and offers you a lot of festive gear. The Blighted Fragments dropped by the Frigid Husks you defeated earlier also act as currency with Gileon for those looking to grab every item available in Diablo 4&#39;s Midwinter Blight.

Among the available gear from Gileon is a Mount Trophy for your steed, a new Legendary Aspect called &#34;Shard of Dawn,&#34; weapon cosmetics, and class-specific Trophies. Shard of Dawn has three complex buffs for your character with abilities that truly reflect the madness of the holidays in Diablo 4. You also get the Frigid and Reveler titles when you defeat the Red-Cloaked Horror for the first time.

Anyone who manages to summon and beat the Red-Cloaked Horror in Diablo 4 can begin to enjoy the best rewards from the seasonal event before it eventually ends.
