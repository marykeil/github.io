## Literature Review

Spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offer fantastic enhancements but are limited by spell slots. Here is how you can gain the effects without spending slots.





Most classes in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gain access to additional spells as they level. Players can experiment and try different combinations as the story progresses. However, these powerful effects are limited by spell slots. For example, a level three Cleric can only cast two second-level spells and four first-level spells. All spell slots are recovered after a Long Rest, while a few classes recover some on a Short Rest. Certain spells, such as Mage Armour, last an entire in-game day, leading players to designate a specific character to primarily buff allies.




                  7 Best Alternate Uses For Spells In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a wide variety of spells, each with unique effects. Many of these have alternate uses in and out of combat encounters.   


 How To Save Spell Slots In Baldur Gate 3&#39;s Honour Mode 
         

Players must take every opportunity to gain an advantage in Honour Mode. This difficulty is brutal and can kill party members easily. The best way to fight back is by having spell slots available when in combat. Withers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the answer to succeeding in these encounters. This undead NPC has three main uses for players.

 Withers can revive allies, respec characters, and recruit hirelings. This last function allows for additional allies to be added to the camp at the cost of 100 gold. You do not need to bring hirelings into combat, yet they can still be instrumental. Hirelings can cast spells on the party, thus using their own spell slots and saving yours for later. This is also great for making a hireling a different class than what is currently in your party.




To survive Honour Mode, players will want to cast spells that last until a Long Rest on their party members. However, certain effects will override current buffs, such as gaining additional temporary hit points. Many spells last for this duration, but some are extremely potent in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Honour Mode. One of the best ways to ensure that characters can continue a fight is by casting Death Ward. This spell prevents the targets from being reduced to zero hit points once, instead leaving them at one health.

Death Ward gives players a safety net in case they are ambushed or something unexpected happens. Another great spell to cast is Warding Bond. Characters gain a &#43;1 bonus to their armor class, saving throws, and resistance to all damage. However, the caster takes the same amount of damage from each hit. Every spell that lasts until a Long Rest that can be cast on allies is listed below:
