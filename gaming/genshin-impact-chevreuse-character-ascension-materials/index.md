## Literature Review

You will need to farm a lot of materials to fully Ascend Chevreuse and her Talents in Genshin Impact. Here’s everything you need to gather.





In terms of gameplay, Chevreuse is a unique character. Most of the bonuses she provides her team as a support unit are only activated when she is paired up with Pyro and Electro units. As a Pyro character herself, she is best utilized when inserted into Overloaded-based teams. She can still be useful and even provide healing for other types of characters, but Chevreuse is at her best along with other Pyro and Electro units, as she will decrease opponents’ Resistance to the two elements. Following Chevreuse’s debut in the Phase 2 banners in Genshin Impact 4.3, she will be added to the standard loot pool.




                  Genshin Impact: Navia Character Builds (Weapons, Artifacts, Team Comps)   You can increase Navia’s value as a DPS unit in Genshin Impact with the best build and ideal team comp to accompany her on-field Geo presence.   


 Ascension Materials To Farm For Chevreuse In Genshin Impact 
         

The first set of materials you will need to farm for Chevreuse’s Ascension is Agnidus Agate Sliver and its evolved forms, Agnidus Agate Fragment, Agnidus Agate Chunk, and Agnidus Agate Gemstone, respectively. These elemental stones can be gathered from Pyro-based bosses in Genshin Impact, such as the Pyro Regisvine, Pyro Hypostasis, and the Emperor of Fire and Iron. The weekly boss encounter against La Signora can also drop the required Agnidus Agate stones. These items can also be obtained from in-game events and other limited-time activities. If you have been playing for a long time, likely, you will already have a large stock of these items.






As Chevreuse goes through her Ascension stages, the rarity of the items needed will increase. Families of items with varying rarities will likely need to be transformed by using the Alchemy Table.




The next set of items you need to farm for Chevreuse is Meshing Gear and its evolutions, Mechanical Spur Gear and Artificed Dynamic Gear, respectively. These items are dropped from Clockwork Meka opponents. This enemy type can only be found in the region of Fontaine, but they are widespread, both above the surface as well as underwater. It is important to farm a vast amount of Gears, as they are not only used for Chevreuse’s Ascension but also her Talents in Genshin Impact. As such, it is recommended that you muster up a surplus when farming Gears for the 4-star Pyro character.

In addition to that, you will also need an item called the Fontemer Unihorn, which can only be obtained by defeating a world boss called the Millenial Pearl Seahorse. This creature is located in an underwater cave in Fontaine. Its location, however, is easily seen on the world map. A fair amount is needed, so you will be required to fight this beast a few times. The last material required for Chevreuse’s Ascension is the Lumidouce Bell, a Fontainian Local Specialty that can be farmed in the higher portions of the Beryl, Belleau, and Court of Fontaine regions. There are also some northeast of the Marcotte Station.




The table below lists all the required materials for Chevreuse’s Ascension in Genshin Impact, including the amounts per level threshold and the rewards you get for going through with the Ascension:

 Chevreuse Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Genshin Impact   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    1x Agnidus Agate Sliver   3x Meshing Gear   3x Lumidouce Bell   20,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 40 Ascension    3x Agnidus Agate Fragment   15x Meshing Gear   10x Lumidouce Bell   2x Fontemer Unihorn   40,000x Mora     -   Level 50 Ascension    6x Agnidus Agate Fragment   12x Mechanical Spur Gear   20x Lumidouce Bell   4x Fontemer Unihorn   60,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 60 Ascension    3x Agnidus Agate Chunk   18x Mechanical Spur Gear   30x Lumidouce Bell   8x Fontemer Unihorn   80,000x Mora     -   Level 70 Ascension    6x Agnidus Agate Chunk   12x Artificed Dynamic Gear   45x Lumidouce Bell   12x Fontemer Unihorn   100,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 80 Ascension    6x Agnidus Agate Gemstone   24x Artificed Dynamic Gear   60x Lumidouce Bell   20x Fontemer Unihorn   120,000x Mora     -   Total Materials    1x Agnidus Agate Sliver   9x Agnidus Agate Fragment   9x Agnidus Agate Chunk   6x Agnidus Agate Gemstone   18x Meshing Gear   30x Mechanical Spur Gear   36x Artificed Dynamic Gear   168x Lumidouce Bell   46x Fontemer Unihorn   420,000x Mora       3x Acquaint Fate      



Of course, each character Ascension threshold imposed by Chevreuse will also require some Mora to get through. While you will need 420,000 Mora to execute all the Ascension processes, an extra 1,673,400 Mora will be required if you are using Character EXP materials to level Chevreuse in Genshin Impact.






 Materials For Chevreuse’s Talents (Abilities) In Genshin Impact 
          

After you have successfully leveled Chevreuse to 90, you can start thinking about increasing her Talents. To do this, however, you will also need to farm some materials. The Talent books she uses are those of Order. Teachings of Order, Guide to Order, and Philosophies of Order can be farmed from the Pale Forgotten Glory Domain. For reference, this Domain is located underwater, north of Poisson. These specific Talent books can only be farmed on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. They can also be obtained from events and chests, but the best consistent source of Order Talent books in Genshin Impact is the Pale Forggeton Glory Domain.

As was previously mentioned, Meshing Gear, Mechanical Spur Gear, and Artificed Dynamic Gear are also used in Chevreuse’s Talents, so you will need to farm a huge amount of these materials – and adequately use the Alchemy Table to transform lower-quality items into higher-quality ones based on your needs. As you start to reach higher levels with Chevreuse’s Talents, you will also need to start farming Lightless Eye of the Maelstrom from the All-Devouring Narwhal boss in Genshin Impact. There is a weekly limit to challenging it, and the boss can drop varied items, so it may take a while before you get what you need.




 Chevreuse Talent Materials In Genshin Impact   Teachings of Order    9x      Guide to Order    63x      Philosophies of Order    114x      Meshing Gear    18x      Mechanical Spur Gear    66x      Artificed Dynamic Gear    93x      Lightless Eye of the Maelstrom    18x      Crown of Insight    3x      Mora    4,957,500x      





While this is a weekly boss fight that is unlocked through the campaign, there is a feature available in the Adventurer Handbook that allows you to challenge the opponent even if you are not caught up with the story.







To go through the final stages in each of Chevreuse’s three upgradeable Talents, you will also need to use Crown of Insight. Only three of these items are needed to fully upgrade Chevreuse’s abilities at C0, but they are hard to obtain as they are only granted by limited-time events and other offering systems. You will also need a large amount of Mora to level all of Chevreuse’s Talents to the maximum level. It is not particularly hard to fully Ascend Chevreuse in Genshin Impact, but the farming process can be long.
