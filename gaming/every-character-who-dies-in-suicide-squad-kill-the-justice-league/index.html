  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>As is the case with most of the stories centered around Task Force X, Suicide Squad: KTJL sees many characters killed throughout its campaign.</p>
<p>As is the case with most of the stories centered around Amanda Waller&rsquo;s Task Force X, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sees many characters killed throughout its campaign. Task Force X (or the titular &ldquo;Suicide Squad&rdquo; as its also, unofficially called) constantly has the threat of death looming over each of its members, as Waller forces the rag tag team of supervillains and anti-heroes to do her bidding by implanting bombs in their heads and keeping her finger on the remote detonator at all times just in case they go astray.
[Warning: The following article contains major spoilers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.]Rocksteady&rsquo;s latest entry to its acclaimed Arkhamverse also puts several other fan-favorite DC characters - both new and returning to the universe - in the firing line. As per its titular premise, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sees Waller issuing a kill order on DC&rsquo;s primary superhero team after Brainiac is successful in brainwashing members of the Justice League to assist him in his invasion of Metropolis, and the game is bold enough to subvert expectations of trying to find a peaceful resolution and actually follow through with this mission, leading to several shocking moments.
Although it&rsquo;s stated that Brainiac has taken 99% of Metropolis&rsquo; citizens, they aren&rsquo;t killed (not until they go into combat against Task Force X, at least). Instead, they are transformed into his minions.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Release Date, Characters, &amp; Gameplay
After several delays, Suicide Squad: KTJL will return to the Arkhamverse as Task Force X takes on mind-controlled members of the Justice League.</p>
<p>9  Dr. Sydney Happersen Is Killed By A LexCorp Bomb
One Of Lex Luthor&rsquo;s Scientists Is Suicide Squad: KTJL&rsquo;s First Fatality</p>
<p>The first death in the game is that of one of LexCorp&rsquo;s &ldquo;shining stars&rdquo;, Dr. Sydney Happersen. Happersen climbed the ranks within the company to become an assistant to Lex Luthor. Using his scientific expertise, Happerson offered to remove Task Force X&rsquo;s bombs, but Waller found out. Trying to cover his tracks from Waller, Luthor detonated a bomb of his own that was implanted in the scientist&rsquo;s head instead and started deleting all data. Enraged, Waller then destroyed the machine that could extract Task Force X&rsquo;s bombs as a punishment for the breach of trust.</p>
<p>8  Lex Luthor Is Killed By Flash
Superman&rsquo;s Nemesis Did Have A Heart After All</p>
<p>Upon trying to save Lex Luthor from a brainwashed Flash, Task Force X believes Luthor has managed to get the upper hand over the speedster with a gadget that stunned him and opened him up for attack. After the Suicide Squad unloads a barrage of bullets into a bus containing the stunned Flash, and it explodes, the team believes they have successfully killed their first Justice League member. This victory is short-lived, however, as Luthor notices a patch of blood on his chest and suddenly falls down dead. Flash then appears alongside him, holding Luthor&rsquo;s heart and saying &ldquo;What do you know? He did have a heart!&rdquo;
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League later introduces a different Lex Luthor from another universe who survives.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Cast: Who Plays Which Character
Suicide Squad: KTJL, has an impressive roster of DC characters, with many actors reprising their roles from previous games.</p>
<p>7  Flash Is The First Justice League Member To Die
Lex Luthor&rsquo;s Tech Helps Task Force X Kill The Fastest Man Alive</p>
<p>When Task Force X meets with Flash for the first time, he isn&rsquo;t under Brainiac&rsquo;s control and attempts to fend off a brainwashed Green Lantern. Unfortunately, Flash then goes through an ordeal as he is knocked unconscious by Green Lantern and also has his finger &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; cut off by Boomerang before Batman succeeds in capturing him and taking him to Brainiac to become brainwashed.
After luring him out with a live stream taunting him, Flash is the first member of the Justice League who players fight. Toyman has been able to repair Luthor&rsquo;s anti-Flash &ldquo;Decoupler&rdquo; tech, giving Task Force X an advantage over the speedster for the first time and allowing them to fatally shoot him.
The &ldquo;Thunderstruck!&rdquo; Trophy/Achievement is unlocked by killing Flash.</p>
<p>King Shark then tries to give a respectful send-off for the hero who saved Task Force X&rsquo;s life against Green Lantern earlier. However, Captain Boomerang has other ideas after their years-long rivalry and proceeds to urinate on Flash&rsquo;s corpse and starts to deliver a victory speech before being interrupted by the arrival of Green Lantern.
After Flash is killed, Task Force X goes through a portal and arrives on another version of Earth that&rsquo;s already been decimated by Brainiac. Although they are helped back to their earth by the Lex Luthor variant, this opens up the Elseworlds concept that will be present in the game&rsquo;s post-launch chapters.</p>
<p>6  Green Lantern Is The Second Justice League Member To Die
Yellow Lantern Tech Helps Task Force X Take Down Green Lantern</p>
<p>Green Lantern wasn&rsquo;t shown as prominently in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&rsquo;s trailers, but is the first Justice League member players are introduced to in the game. Very shortly after entering Metropolis for the first time, Task Force X is caught in an Oan Power trap and taken on a tour of Metropolis as Green Lantern explains some of Brainiac&rsquo;s plan and shows the team as several civilians are transformed into hordes of alien creatures.
In exchange for not being handed over to Waller, the Lex Luthor of Earth 2 leads Task Force X to a secret base under Wayne Bank where Batman developed a Yellow Lantern battery. When attached to a weapon, this destabilizes Green Lantern&rsquo;s Oan constructs and makes him vulnerable to attacks. Deadshot delivers the killing shot to a weakened Green Lantern
The &ldquo;Blackest Night&rdquo; Trophy/Achievement is unlocked by killing Green Lantern.</p>
<p>King Shark removes his finger with the Power ring still attached, becoming a Green Lantern himself. He then uses this to create a massive shark construct that he uses to destroy the shields around Brainiac&rsquo;s skull ship, allowing Waller to launch a nuke at it that is ultimately stopped by a brainwashed Superman.</p>
<p>5  Wonder Woman Is Defeated By Superman
The Princess Of Themyscira Didn&rsquo;t Succumb To Brainiac&rsquo;s Mind Control</p>
<p>Wonder Woman was the only member of the Justice League immune to Brainiac&rsquo;s mind control. After Superman stopped the nuclear warhead, Wonder Woman used her Kryptonite-enhanced shield in an attempt to subdue him. Their battle continues in the background as Task Force X attempts to escort Waller out harm&rsquo;s way, with Lois Lane&rsquo;s updates informing survivors where to go to stay clear of the superpowered battle, which is causing huge amounts of collateral damage despite Wonder Woman&rsquo;s best attempts.
Superman and Wonder Woman&rsquo;s battle comes to an end outside the Hall of Justice. When Wonder Woman uses a Kryptonite shard from her shield to stab the Man of Steel in the chest it looks like the battle may have swung in her favor, but Superman uses the last of his energy to kill her with his heat vision before flying back to Brainiac.
Harley kneels next to Wonder Woman as she dies, with Wonder Woman wondering why the Kryptonite didn&rsquo;t kill Superman. As King Shark finally declares her heart has stopped beating, Wonder Woman turns back to the clay she was once sculpted from by her mother, Queen Hippolyta, before cracking and blowing away in the wind.</p>
<p>4  Robin Was Killed By Batman
Tim Drake Died Some Time Before Task Force X&rsquo;s Arrival</p>
<p>Task Force X accesses one of Batman&rsquo;s Batcaves under the Metropolis Hydro Power Station in search of a way to stop Superman after finding green Kryptonite doesn&rsquo;t have as much impact. When they arrive, they find a hologram from the Dark Knight prior to his brainwashing in which he addresses the Arkhamverse&rsquo;s current Robin, Tim Drake. The holographic recording shares Batman&rsquo;s countermeasures for how to defeat the Justice League should any of them become compromised.
While Batman simply states &ldquo;There is no anti-Batman device,&rdquo; he does provide the much-needed information on how to kill Superman. Unfortunately, as the hologram plays, King Shark then spots Robin&rsquo;s mask on the ground in a pool of blood and states &ldquo;Robin was here. I do not think he won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3  Harley Quinn Shoots Batman In The Head
The Arkhamverse&rsquo;s Batman Is No More</p>
<p>The Arkhamverse&rsquo;s Batman is the character in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League who players are most acquainted with, having played as the character prominently for several games in the series already. The Dark Knight can often be seen in the distance when free-roaming Metropolis as he constantly stalks Task Force X and relays information back to Brainiac. When exploring &ldquo;The Batman Experience&rdquo; in one of Metropolis&rsquo; museums, players get to experience what it&rsquo;s like to be the prey in one of the Batman: Arkham games&rsquo; Predator missions, as the intense sequence sees each member of Task Force X get taken out one-by-one.
After tracking Batman down in his Batcave, the Dark Knight uses Scarecrow&rsquo;s Fear Toxin on Task Force X. Fortunately, Harley&rsquo;s experience with Scarecrow in the past has given her the knowledge to turn this against Batman. After defeating the Dark Knight, Task Force X binds him and takes him to LexCorp where Lex Luthor can study how Brainiac&rsquo;s corruption is changing the Justice League&rsquo;s physicality.
The &ldquo;Endgame&rdquo; Trophy/Achievement is unlocked for defeating Batman.</p>
<p>After Luthor has finished his experiment, Task Force X uses the bound and weakened Batman to lure out Superman. King Shark then drops Batman onto a bench, where Task Force X and Batman berate each other. Finally, after talking about her history with Batman, Harley shoots him in the head at point-blank range.
Lois Lane&rsquo;s tribute to Batman is the post-credits sequence for the game, and doubles as a tribute to the actor who portrayed him, Kevin Conroy, who passed away in November 2022.</p>
<p>5 Ways Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League Is Like Batman Arkham (&amp; 5 Ways It&rsquo;s Different)
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a somewhat unusual heir to the Batman: Arkham series, with major similarities and differences alike.</p>
<p>2  Superman Was The Last Justice League Member Standing
Gold Kryptonite Weakened The Man Of Steel</p>
<p>Superman was the first Justice League member shown in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&rsquo;s reveal trailer, as he obliterated an A.R.G.U.S. agent with his heat vision while under Brainiac&rsquo;s mind control. This moment established the major threat that Task Force X would face from the outset of the game&rsquo;s marketing campaign, although players actually came face to face with the Man of Steel later in the game.
After using Batman to lure him out, Task Force X uses Gold Kryptonite to weaken Superman. In the comics, Gold Kryptonite is a rare form that can negate a Kryptonian&rsquo;s healing factor under a yellow sun, and can potentially remove their powers forever. In Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, however, Luthor calls it a new compound designed to dampen Superman&rsquo;s powers, much like the technology used to defeat Flash and Green Lantern.
The &ldquo;Abandon All Hope&rdquo; Trophy/Achievement is unlocked for killing Superman.</p>
<p>1  Amanda Waller Kills Brainiac
But There Are 12 More Variants Across The Multiverse Left To Kill</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the main villain of the game, Brainiac, dies many times in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. After killing Superman, Task Force X is abducted and brought aboard Brainiac&rsquo;s ship, where he tells them how he sees their potential and could transform them to make them superior as he continues trying to make Earth into a New Colu. He then mentions his wider plans to conquer the multiverse, asking &ldquo;why stop at one Earth?&rdquo;
This conversation is cut short, as Task Force X is suddenly transported back to LexCorp. Here, Lex Luthor (now looking closer to his original Earth 1 counterpart) tells them that the Brainiac they met is one of thirteen, and the team will also have to defeat the remaining twelve versions of him across other universes in what Deadshot deems &ldquo;an eternal conflict.&rdquo; Brainiac can only be fought after stopping his Terraforming plans via a certain number of side missions.
The first Brainiac players can face resides in Earth 2 who transforms himself into a Brainiac/Flash hybrid. After working alongside the Support Squad to capture Brainiac and bring him back to Earth 1, Waller stabs Luthor&rsquo;s Dataspike into his head.
The &ldquo;No One Defeats Brainiac!&rdquo; Trophy/Achievement is unlocked for killing Brainiac.</p>
<p>As explained by Luthor, the Dataspike downloads a fragmented branch of Brainiac&rsquo;s network through Coluan technology and kills that version of Brainiac, blowing up a chunk of the Skull ship in the process. While the death of this Brainiac triggers Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&rsquo;s end credits, players will still have to embark upon various Elseworld missions to kill the remaining Brainiacs.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad Kill The Justice League<br>
Set in the Arkham game universe, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is an action third-person shooter live-service game from the developers at Rocksteady. Players will choose from one of four members in the Suicide Squad, headed by Amanda Waller, as they&rsquo;re forced to take on their most difficult challenge yet - to face a corrupted slate of the world&rsquo;s greatest heroes, including the Flash, Batman, and Superman. The game allows for teams of up to four players as characters collect gear to improve their chances of survival.</p>
