## Literature Review

The Elite Four trainers of the Blueberry League (BB) are hard opponents to beat in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, unless you&#39;re prepared.





One piece of advice before challenging the Elite Four is to make sure your Pokémon are at least Level 75 or higher. The signature Pokémon of nearly all the Elite Four members is Level 80, but the rest of their team is usually between Levels 75-78. Explore the new map of The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet to challenge strong wild creatures and other people to train your team best.






Some Legendary Pokémon variants are available to find at Level 75 throughout The Indigo Disk DLC, and can become powerful allies for your battles against the BB Elite Four.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Raging Bolt in Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Raging Bolt is a new Paradox Pokémon introduced with the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet. Here’s how to unlock it and Raging Bolt’s location.   


 How to Defeat Crispin 
          

The first member of the BB Elite Four is the Fire-type specialist Crispin, who you must defeat in a double battle. This trainer sets the trend for the rest of the Elite Four with six Pokémon for you to beat back to back. The strongest Pokémon on Crispin&#39;s team also have the ability to Terastalize in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet into the Fire-type, which boosts the power of moves that share the same type.






All members of the BB Elite Four challenge you to a double battle, where two of your Pokemon must battle against two of theirs at the same time.




  Pokémon   Type   Level   Tera-Type    Talonflame   Fire/Flying   77   N/A    Camerupt   Fire/Ground   78   N/A    Rotom (Heat Form)   Fire/Electric   77   N/A    Exeggutor   Grass/Psychic   78   N/A    Magmortar   Fire   78   N/A    Blaziken   Fire/Fighting   79   Fire   





Crispin&#39;s Blaziken has the ability to Terastalize and increase its Speed every round. Make sure to take out this Pokémon quickly with strong Water-type or Ground-type moves like Surf or Earthquake.







Water-type, Ground-type, and Rock-type Pokémon are great counters against Crispin, but watch out for his Exeggutor. Talonflame typically sets up Sunny Day the moment it arrives into battle to boost the power of Fire-type moves. Exeggutor&#39;s Solarbeam fires immediately without a turn to charge while Sunny Day is active, and can knock out most Water-types in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet in a single hit.

When you beat Crispin, he rewards you with TM 207 Temper Flare, which has 75 Power and 100% Accuracy. This attack is a Physical Fire-type move whose attack power doubles if the Pokémon using it missed their previous attack. The only exception to this is if the user was recharging from their previous attack or if their move was defended by a barrier move such as Protect or Detect.



 How to Defeat Amarys 
          




The next Elite Four member to take on is Amarys and their Steel-type Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Unlike Crispin, Amarys has a lot of team members with secondary typings that cover their weaknesses. There are some consistencies you can exploit, however, to gain an advantage against this calculating opponent and their defensive Pokémon.

  Pokémon   Type   Level   Tera-Type    Dugtrio (Alolan)   Steel/Ground   78   N/A    Skarmory   Steel/Flying   78   N/A    Empoleon   Steel/Water   79   N/A    Reuniclus   Psychic   79   N/A    Scizor   Steel/Bug   79   N/A    Metagross   Steel/Psychic   80   Steel   



A Fire-Type Pokémon could easily eliminate Scizor and Skarmory, but this type will have problems against the super-effective moves performed by Amarys&#39; Empolean and Dugtrio. A Dark-type Pokémon has a chance to take out Metagross and Reuniclus in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet by taking advantage of either creature&#39;s Psychic-typing.




A Fighting-type should be able to take out Empoleon, while a Water-type should counter Dugtrio in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Keep in mind that Dugtrio has a Focus Sash, which will allow it to survive with 1 HP from a move that would knock it out. You receive TM 225 Hard Press from beating Amarys; a Steel-type move that deals more damage if a Pokémon has greater HP.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   



 How to Defeat Lacey 
          

The third opponent in the BB Elite Four is Lacey and her Fairy-type Pokémon team in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. This battle tests your knowledge of Terastalization, since Lacey&#39;s strongest Pokémon only has the Fairy-type when it transforms. Similar to the past two battles, there are a couple of pocket monsters on Lacey&#39;s team that could trip up those who just plan to counter one type.




  Pokémon   Type   Level   Tera-Type    Granbull   Fairy   78   N/A    Whimsicott   Fairy/Grass   78   N/A    Slowbro (Galarian)   Poison/Psychic   79   N/A    Primarina   Fairy/Water   79   N/A    Alcremie   Fairy   79   N/A    Excadrill   Ground/Steel   80   Fairy   



There are fewer tricks this time around, besides the Tera form of Excadrill drastically changing its type in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Dark-type and Poison-type Pokémon are excellent against Lacey&#39;s team, since poisonous creatures take less damage from Grass-type attacks seen by Whimsicott as well.

Taking down Lacey rewards you with a teachable Fairy-type move that has 80 Power and 100% Accuracy called TM 227 Alluring Voice. This move also causes confusion if the Pokémon it hits raises its stats in any way during the same turn in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Only a few Pokémon can learn this attack, but it may be useful to learn for the upcoming battle against the final member of the BB Elite Four.






 How to Defeat Drayton 
          

Drayton is the last BB Elite Four member to beat, and carries a team of fierce Dragon-type Pokémon into battle that can be a hard challenge to face. According to YouTube creator ConCon, you must exploit certain weaknesses in each one of Drayton&#39;s Pokémon to stand a chance. Every individual creature Drayton uses could be an ace Pokémon for another trainer, and has extremely powerful moves.


 

  Pokémon   Type   Level   Tera-Type    Flygon   Dragon/Ground   78   N/A    Dragonite   Dragon   78   N/A    Haxorus   Dragon   79   N/A    Kingdra   Dragon/Water   79   N/A    Sceptile   Grass   79   N/A    Archaludon   Dragon/Steel   80   Dragon   






The heaviest hitters here are Dragonite and Archaludon, since both have incredibly high attacking power with a ton of HP. These bulky dragons are best defeated by Fairy-type Pokemon, who can cleave through their defenses in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Sceptile is the only Pokémon that isn&#39;t vulnerable to Fairy-type moves, but one Fire-type or Flying-type should be able to take it down.

Managing to beat Drayton gives you TM 226 Dragon Cheer, which raises the critical hit chances of your allies by one stage. This boost goes to two stages if the Pokémon is a Dragon-type in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. This effect is nullified when the buffed Pokémon is switched out, and does not work at all if that creature is already affected by Focus Energy or Dragon Cheer.

Those who beat the BB Elite Four in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet have a chance to take on a new Champion, who happens to be someone they might recognize.
