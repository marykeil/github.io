## Literature Review

The Monday Wordle is available for anyone to solve and today&#39;s answer might make a few fans of the game lose their long-standing win streaks.





For those that prefer a more difficult challenge, there is Wordle&#39;s Hard Mode which can be accessed through its options menu before starting the game. This locks in clues given by forcing the user to use the correct letters in every subsequent guess. Hard Mode is a great way to lower the number of guesses a game takes, but does require a bit more brain power to complete.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
November 27th #891
          

The November 27th Wordle answer is TAWNY.




For our starting Wordle word we used IRATE which provided two incorrectly placed letters with &#39;A&#39; and &#39;T&#39;. Moving them around a bit we tried TAPAS as our second guess, this locked in the two letters we already knew and provided a few more incorrect ones.

Moving on we tried TALON as our third guess and got another misplaced letter with &#39;N&#39;. As the attempts started to diminish we tried out TANGY as our fourth try. This was the best progress yet and provided us the &#39;Y&#39; in its correct spot as well as another incorrect placement for &#39;N&#39;. Knowing there is only one possible place for the &#39;N&#39; to go we ended up scoring our Wordle win-in-five with TAWNY. Another addition to the win streak and another new word learned.
