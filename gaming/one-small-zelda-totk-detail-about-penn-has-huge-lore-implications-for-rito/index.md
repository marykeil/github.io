## Literature Review

Penn displays an interesting ability in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which carries dramatic implications for the rest of the Rito.




Meeting the journalistic Rito Penn in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom offers some fascinating new lore regarding the Rito as a whole. Unlike other notable races like the Hylians and Gorons, the Rito have only appeared in a small handful of games, including TOTK. As a result, there is much more room to develop their species’ abilities and culture than the other inhabitants of Hyrule, something which TOTK has subtly taken advantage of.




The Rito first appeared in The Wind Waker, albeit in a much different form to their modern incarnation. Here, they look more like beak-nosed and talon-footed humans. This version of the Rito somewhat bizarrely evolved from the Zora (an already amphibious race) in response to the flooding of Hyrule, although it is uncertain if the version of the Rito seen in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have similar roots. It is worth noting, however, that the Divine Beast Vah Medoh seems to be named after The Wind Waker’s Medli, implying some level of continuity with this part of The Legend of Zelda’s infamous timeline.

 Penn Can Talk To Birds In Tears Of The Kingdom 
          

In Tears of the Kingdom, Penn demonstrates a curious ability which suggests that the changes to the Rito are far from being cosmetic. When Link approaches him outside various stables as part of the &#34;Potential Princess Sightings&#34; Side Adventure, Penn can be seen gathering information from actual birds, which relate various pieces of gossip and rumors to him, explaining how news from across Hyrule can reach him so easily. The Rito is evidently able to understand their chirping as speech, and there is nothing to suggest that this is unique to Penn alone. Instead, the implication is that all Rito have the same impressive ability to talk to birds.




Rito being able to communicate with birds does make a lot of sense, as they can essentially be seen as birds themselves. Their name even seems to come from the Japanese word for bird, &#34;tori.&#34; Moreover, given that they have beaks instead of mouths, it is perhaps more surprising that Rito can speak Hylian without the use of lips. While this is clearly just a stylistic choice, it does also imply that Rito vocal cords must be radically different from those of other Hyrulean races. Therefore, although Penn is seen responding to his bird friends in Hylian, it is possible that the Rito is also capable of chirping a response.

Penn talking so casually with birds also brings up numerous other questions regarding Rito culture. Assuming that all Rito can do so, they could ask birds to pass on messages for them, or ask for information in the same way that Penn does. Perhaps the entire avian wildlife of Hyrule supplies news to Rito Village, which would undoubtedly make its residents among the most well-informed in all of Hyrule. On the other hand, Link never really benefits from this; while the Rito do attempt to find Zelda after their regional phenomena quest is resolved, the princess’ Dracnonification makes this a hopeless endeavor no matter what they may try.






 Penn’s Ability Raises Questions About Hyrule’s Wildlife 
          

Assuming that all birds are intelligent enough to converse in TOTK, even if not understandably to Hylians, this does pose an ethical dilemma. Link is entirely capable of hunting several types of bird, a prospect which immediately turns nightmarish with the reveal of Penn’s sources. It makes it seem that Link is actually killing and eating sapient beings, as are many other inhabitants of Hyrule. Naturally, the morality of doing so is far from agreeable, although no one, not even the Rito themselves, appear to be concerned by this part of Hyrulean culture.

Of course, TOTK is far from the first Zelda game to show that Hyrule’s animals have a notable level of intelligence. Link himself can talk to various animals in Twilight Princess as Wolf Link, a seemingly minor ability which nevertheless proves to be hugely beneficial to him when gathering information, in a manner very similar to Penn. Wolf Link is even able to learn about secrets in the surrounding area by summoning a Hawk, allowing him to uncover hidden items with ease. Additionally, Telma’s cat Lousie guides Link through Castle Town’s sewers as part of reaching Princess Zelda for help when Midna is on the brink of death.






Louise also plays a role in restoring Ilia’s memories, by pointing Link in the direction of the amnesiac’s stolen wooden statue.






 Tears Of The Kingdom Makes The Rito A Truly Unique Race 
         

The new design of the Rito makes them far more distinctive than in The Wind Waker. In addition to this, as the Rito have become more bird-like, it seems that they have also grown close enough to true birds in order to speak with them. This is a far cry from their Wind Waker selves, who are not born with wings, and must gain them from their guardian Spirit, Valoo. Assuming that both appearances are part of the same continuity, then The Wind Waker’s Rito are conceivably still in the middle of evolving into the &#34;full&#34; Rito seen in BOTW and TOTK, explaining them now being born with wings.




Penn’s ability to talk to birds is an interesting detail that is not directly addressed in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but which nevertheless has immense implications. Even putting aside the concerning moral dilemma it poses, being able to talk to birds makes it clear that the Rito have fully embraced the skies. There is no trace of their aquatic ancestry, and instead it seems that they have found new kin. Penn’s widespread sources also explain how he is able to so easily gather information from across all of Hyrule, chasing down any and all rumors of Princess Zelda to their origins in no time.

               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017.
