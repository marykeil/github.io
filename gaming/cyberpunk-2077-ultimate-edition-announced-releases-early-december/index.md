## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will contain the game&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC and will be released in time for the holidays both digitally and on disc.




Cyberpunk 2077 is getting a re-release in time for the holidays. This new &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; seems to be a send-off for the game, which despite having a troubled launch has been greatly improved by CD Projekt Red and is now widely acclaimed.




The Cyberpunk 2077 X account announced that Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be released on December 5 on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC, priced at around $60 USD. This Ultimate Edition will be available for purchase both digitally and in physical form and will include the original Cyberpunk 2077 game along with all the upgrades and enhancements seen in the 2.0 update, along with the Phantom Liberty story expansion. It will be the first Xbox game to come on three discs.


 

                  Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition For Xbox And PlayStation Have One Huge Difference   Cyberpunk 2077 is getting an Ultimate Edition soon, but the Xbox and PC versions have one thing the PS5 version lacks. Hereâ€™s what it is and why.   


 Cyberpunk 2077 Previously Only Had A Physical Release On Last-Gen 
PS4 And Xbox One Had Disc Versions
          




While all of the content included in the Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is already available for purchase, the game only previously had a physical release on last-gen consoles. The original release of Cyberpunk 2077 was disastrous on last-gen devices, resulting in PlayStation removing it from its store and offering refunds to those who purchased it, and as time has gone on, the last-gen version has been left behind as CDPR made the Phantom Liberty expansion available solely on current-gen devices.

A digital cross-gen upgrade was made available for those who purchased the game on last-gen systems to receive improved frame rates and graphics via backward compatibility on PS5 and Xbox Series X devices. Later patches - such as the recent 2.0 overhaul - redeemed the game in the eyes of many, which is why physical media collectors who have held off purchasing the game until now should definitely consider the Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition set.
