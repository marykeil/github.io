## Literature Review

V starts out having one apartment in Cyberpunk 2077, but there are several more that they can obtain during their time in Night City and beyond.




Cyberpunk 2077 isn&#39;t exactly a cozy home decorating game, yet there are several different apartments that V can call home over the course of their time in the game. V begins with one default apartment but has many options open up to them, including one that is part of the Phantom Liberty DLC deep in the heart of Dogtown. Each of these possible living quarters varies drastically in location, comfort, style, and cost, including a few that are free, particularly those related to romantic relationships with NPCs.
Apartments in Cyberpunk 2077 do not come with decorating or customization options, except for a few purchasable upgrades to the starting apartment which V has at the start of the game. Having access to these homes is useful, however, with inventory stashes, weapon racks, and mirrors to customize the character&#39;s appearance. Additionally, using the interactive items in the apartments can grant helpful buffs. For example, taking a shower will provide the Refreshed buff, sleeping in bed will give the Rested buff, and brewing coffee will give the Energized buff.
            
 
 Cyberpunk 2077: Apartments Guide (Locations, Costs, &amp; Buffs) 
The new 1.5 update for Cyberpunk 2077 includes four unique apartments in different locations that players can purchase and gain buffs from.












 








 10  Dogtown Apartment - Free 
Located In Kress Street, Dogtown


 







The Dogtown apartment is free for V, as long as the player owns the Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC. It is provided after the &#34;Lucretia My Reflection&#34; mission and is located on Elizabeth Kress Street. While free is a good thing, living in the lawless area of Dogtown is not an ideal place to be, and this apartment is about as bad as one would imagine. The place is littered with trash, has a generator that is very loud, and does not have water turned on to begin with.





 9  Kutcher&#39;s Home - Free 
Located In Red Peaks, Badlands
        

Kutcher&#39;s Home is another free housing option for V, but is only available if a V enters into a romance with River Ward. V must complete River&#39;s relationship quest, &#34;Following the River,&#34; and follow the relationship path until they can share a home with River in a small trailer park in the Badlands. It is a small home with all the basic functions available of a bed, shower, mirror, stash, and wardrobe, but is also located pretty far away from most of the action taking place in Night City.
Players will only be able to romance River if playing as the female body type V. 






 8  Judy&#39;s Apartment - Free 
Located In Kabuki, Watson


 







Judy is another romance option for V in Cyberpunk 2077, but players can obtain her apartment for free regardless of whether they choose to take the intimate route with her. After finishing Judy&#39;s relationship quest, &#34;Pyramid Song,&#34; Judy states that she is leaving Night City for good and plans to move to Oregon, where her grandparents live. When leaving, she will gift her apartment to V, but if there is a romance happening between Judy and V, then players will find Judy waiting there when they arrive. It is a rundown and messy place, but offers all the necessities needed in a home.
            
 
 Cyberpunk 2077 1.5 Makes Romancing Judy Better 
Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s new 1.5 update has made the game&#39;s romance mechanics even better. In particular, V&#39;s relationship with Judy is much improved.








 7  Northside Apartment - 10,000 Eurodollars 
Located In The Sunset Motel, Northside, Watson
        

Likely one of the smallest apartments in Cyberpunk 2077, the Northside Apartment is available to V at a price of 10,000 Eddies. Though small, and not in the best neighborhood, it is at least a relatively clean and cozy place to be, and comes with the Roach Race arcade machine that can be interacted with. This apartment includes the standard items of a bed, shower, mirror, radio, and stash, as well as a stash wall for Iconic Weapons.
If V&#39;s Intelligence score is high enough, they can hack the keypad next to the Northside Apartment&#39;s door, acquiring ownership at no cost. 






 6  V&#39;s Starter Apartment - Free 
Located In Megabuilding H10, Little China, Watson
        

Compared to some of the apartment choices in the game, surprisingly, the apartment that V already has at the start of the game is very spacious and clean. It is simplistic but can be customized with some purchasable extras, and is where Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Nibbles, a little feline friend, will stay if V completes that quest. Some memorabilia that is gathered from quests will also decorate the home and make it a bit more personalized. This apartment also includes a very special Burrito Vending Machine, which provides an endless supply of burritos.
            
 
 Cyberpunk 2077 Player Shows that V Can Apparently Buy All the Burritos 
One Cyberpunk 2077 player has discovered a vending machine glitch that allows players to endless purchase Burrito XXL Rosados in V&#39;s apartment.








 5  Kerry Eurodyne&#39;s Villa - Free 
Located In North Oak, Westbrook
        

V&#39;s relationships often lead to some pretty shady living situation possibilities, but completing Kerry Eurodyne&#39;s relationship quest can give them access to a pristine villa, at no cost to them. This luxurious home is deep in the cliffs of North Oak in Westbrook and offers the safety of security bots patrolling the home. It is a bit secluded from the rest of Night City, which can make it not as useful, but it is a much nicer place than V is often used to, and it is free as long as V is happy being romantically involved with a rocker boy.





 4  Corpo Plaza Apartment - 110,000 Eurodollars 
Located In Corpo Plaza, City Center
        

The Corpo Plaza apartment is a beautiful, if expensive, home that fits well if V wants to follow the Corpo lifepath. Priced at 110,000 Eddies, this fancy home includes a security checkpoint just to enter and stunning decorations. In addition to the standard home items, this apartment also includes a coffee machine where V can brew coffee to get the Energized buff, granting &#43;25% max stamina and &#43;30% stamina regeneration for one hour. There are many other objects to interact with here for fun, including a record player.
Each apartment price listed here aligns with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s inflated economy courtesy of the 2.0 update. However, the actual prices may still be half (2.0 doubled all apartment prices), and can be seen via the EZEstates website, accessed on the computer in V&#39;s starter apartment in Megabuilding H10. 

            
 
 Which Cyberpunk 2077 Lifepath Is Right For You (&amp; Why) 
Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Corpo, Street Kid, and Nomad lifepaths all differ from one another, with each lending something unique to a given playthrough.








 3  The Glen Apartment - 80,000 Eurodollars 
Located In The Glen, Heywood
        

For a mere 80,000 Eddies, V can get an apartment in The Glen, which is a large and luxurious home but certainly lacks color and coziness. The spacious environment does feature interactive objects, including a record player and pool table, as well as a coffee machine to give that Energized buff. The Roach Race Arcade machine also takes up a spot here, even though something with the word &#34;Roach&#34; in it seems a bit out of place in this pristine environment.





 2  Japantown Apartment - 30,000 Eurodollars 
Located In Japantown, Westbrook


 







The Japantown apartment is considerably smaller than The Glen, and cheaper too, with a price tag of only 30,000 Eddies for it. Despite its size, this apartment feels much more home-like, with many details and cozy additions that make it more of a relaxing place to spend time. This apartment does not include any way to make coffee, but it offers some fun items to interact with, such as a guitar that V can play and burnable incense. This is the best Cyberpunk 2077 apartment players can actually spend time in, but is still outdone by one Night City home.





 1  V&#39;s Penthouse - Free 
Located In Little China, Watson
        

Sadly, the best home in the game is one that players don&#39;t actually get to spend time in. V&#39;s Penthouse is provided for free if the &#34;The Sun&#34; ending is triggered. This large penthouse apartment features its own garden and lots of memorabilia to make it cozy and special. This exquisite apartment is a fitting home for V with this ending path, showing that V is truly a star in Night City. If only developers for Cyberpunk 2077 let V continue to play long enough to enjoy this apartment for a while, it would truly be the best of the best.
