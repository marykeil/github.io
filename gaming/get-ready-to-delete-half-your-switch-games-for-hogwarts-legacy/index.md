# Get Ready To Delete Half Your Switch Games For Hogwarts Legacy


## SUMMARY 



  Hogwarts Legacy is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch, but its storage requirements could be an issue for players due to the system&#39;s limited storage capacity.   The game comes with a mandatory day-one patch that adds 8 GB of additional storage, meaning that the game will take up nearly half of the Switch&#39;s default 32 GB storage.   To address the storage issue, players can use a microSD card to add up to 2 TB of storage, though it won&#39;t match the performance of a gaming computer.

## Literature Review

As a handheld console, the Nintendo Switch has limited storage without the use of a microSD card, and Hogwarts Legacy’s size takes up a chunk of that.




Hogwarts Legacy is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch, but there could be a few problems that come with it due to the system&#39;s hardware and the game&#39;s requirements. Hogwarts Legacy was first released for PC and other consoles in February 2023. However, there are still a couple of weeks before it hits the Switch, and it might force anybody who wants to play it to remove other games first.




                  Hogwarts Legacy Review: A Living, Breathing, Wizarding World   Hogwarts Legacy beautifully recreates the world of Harry Potter and fills it with quirky characters, tense combat, and a huge amount of collectibles.    

Hogwarts Legacy comes with a mandatory day-one patch on the Nintendo Switch. While this isn&#39;t unusual for new games, the size of the patch combined with the size of the game could lead to space issues. Especially since the Nintendo Switch only comes with 32 GB of storage by default, and adding to that amount requires the purchase of equipment like a compatible microSD card.

                  Hogwarts Legacy On Nintendo Switch: Release Date, Changes, Performance Info   Hogwarts Legacy is finally making the jump to Nintendo Switch to round out its availability on all the major platforms. Here’s everything to know.    


 Hogwarts Legacy Will Take Up Half Of The Switch&#39;s Storage 
          




On the Nintendo Switch, Hogwarts Legacy will be about 7 GB, which is much less than the PC version, that&#39;s roughly 73 GB. However, the mandatory day one patch adds another 8 GB to the space needed for Hogwarts Legacy, raising the total to about 15 GB. Since the Nintendo Switch only comes with 32 GB of storage, this means that this single game will take up just under half of the total amount, not considering the space needed for the Switch&#39;s operating system to run.



Hogwart&#39;s Legacy comes to the Nintendo Switch on November 14, 2023.






 Increasing Storage For The Nintendo Switch 
          

Right now, the best way to fix the storage issue for the Nintendo Switch is to use a microSD card, which can add up to 2 TB of additional storage. While this puts it on par with the size of many computer hard drives, it won&#39;t bring the performance up to the level of a gaming computer. However, the Switch&#39;s handheld style benefits Hogwarts Legacy regardless of the decreased performance and graphics quality because the game is full of tasks that are better suited to small bursts of gameplay rather than a marathon of gaming.





 

The Nintendo Switch will soon include the wizarding adventure contained within Hogwarts Legacy, but it might require a few other games to be uninstalled in order to fit it in the console&#39;s limited storage. Otherwise, it creates an opportunity to purchase a microSD card to upgrade the Switch&#39;s capacity, meaning that there&#39;s more variety to choose from at any given time instead of uninstalling and reinstalling games. Hopefully, the next version of the Nintendo Switch, or the console created to replace it in the next generation, comes with more storage, especially if there&#39;s a sequel created for Hogwarts Legacy.
