From a character&#39;s build, their companions, to monumental decisions regarding the ultimate fate of countless NPCs, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, unlike many other RPGs, affords the player the ability to substantially affect the narrative of their game.

 10  Bonespike Garb Is Powerful For Melee Classes 
Rivington General, Act 3


 







Quite possibly the ultimate choice, both cosmetically and in terms of abilities, for players wanting to role-play as a powerful barbarian, the Bonespike Garb is one of the best articles of clothing in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Featuring the effects Slabjaw Determination and Exoskeletal Endurance, the Bonespike Garb is a piece of armor that has a dedicated focus on increasing hit points and reducing the damage suffered from melee attacks. Although it only becomes available in Act 3, the Bonespike Garb is simple to obtain. It can be purchased from Exxvikyap, the Dragonborn merchant, in the Rivington General Store in Rivington.





 9  Poisoner’s Robe Is Easy To Obtain 
Whispering Depths, Act 1
        

One of the best starting armors for spellcaster and sorcerer-based builds in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the Poisoner’s Robe can quite easily be obtained very early in the first Act. Despite being pretty simple to obtain, the Poisoner’s Robe, nevertheless, would make for a wonderful addition to Tav&#39;s wardrobe. Featuring the effect of Poison Trails, the Poisoner’s Robe expands the damage inflicted by poison spells cast by the wearer - contributing an additional 1-4 poison damage each time.
The player can acquire the Poisoner’s Robe from the Spider Matriarch in Whispering Depths under the Blighted Village early on in Act 1. 






 8  Vest Of Soul Rejuvenation Has Powerful Healing Effects 
Sorcerous Sundries, Act 3
        

Perhaps the ultimate choice for a Monk-style character build, the Vest of Soul Rejuvenation has an excellent, highly detailed design and two exceptional effects. Defier’s Rejuvenation which has the effect of allowing the wearer to regain 1-4 hit points if they succeed in a Saving Throw against a spell - and Greater Kushigo Counter which allows the wearer of the Vest of Soul Rejuvenation to make an unarmed strike against any attacker that misses. The Vest of Soul Rejuvenation can be obtained at the Sorcerous Sundries in the Lower City during the third and final Act of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.





 7  Potent Robe Is A Powerful Tiefling Armor 
Alfira, Act 2


 







The Potent Robe is a perfect choice for sorcerers, bards, and any other characters that rely heavily on possessing a high charisma stat. This is due to the fact that the extravagantly designed Potent Robe features two effects that maximize the power of the often overlooked stat - Gregarious Caster and Well-Liked and Well-Fortified. Gregarious Caster allows the player to deal cantrip damage equal to their charisma modifier, and Well-Liked and Well-Fortified temporarily grants the player hit points equal to their charisma modifier. The Potent Robe can be acquired in Act 2 as a reward from Alfira for rescuing the Tieflings.





 6  Obsidian Laced Robe Was Made From Volcanic Glass 
Last Light Inn, Act 2
        

Obsidian is a form of naturally occurring volcanic glass that has rapidly cooled after its creation. Although the material is not reported to have an outstandingly high melting point, a material similar to the black igneous rock is a core component of a rare piece of armor with fire damage-resistant properties, the Obsidian Laced Robe. With the effect Flaming Revenge, the Obsidian Laced Robe is an excellent choice, for not only those keen to avoid being burnt, but also players who employ fire damage as their primary mode of attack. This excellent armor option can be obtained from the trader in Last Light Inn, Quartermaster Talli, during the second act.





 5  Infernal Robe Enhances Fire Damage 
Mizora, Act 1
        

The Infernal Robe, as the name may suggest, is mainly focused on the survival of extreme fire damage. With the effect of granting resistance to fire damage through the level four evocation spell, Fire Shield: Warm, the Infernal Robe can be a literal lifesaver when facing up against powerful enemies proficient in inflicting fire damage. The most straightforward way to obtain the Infernal Robe from Mizora can be achieved if the player recruits Wyll and chooses to kill Karlach - a very difficult decision, but one that could potentially be made easier by the prospect of collecting this excellent and rare article of clothing.

 4  Enraging Heart Garb Generates Wrath 
Lann Tarv, Act 2
        

Enraging Heart Garb is an appropriate name for a piece of clothing with the innate ability to generate wrath. The Enraging Heart Garb can be looted from Lann Tarv while assaulting the main floor of the Moonrise Towers. A rare piece of armor, the Enraging Heart Garb comes with the effect Ruintamer Heart - an effect that allows the wearer, whilst in a rage, to generate two turns of wrath. Though its design is fairly inauspicious, mostly appearing to be brown leather, it seems to feature two shoulder guards comprised of the upper jaws and heads of fairly formidably looking beasts.





 3  Shelter Of Athkatla Provides Mirror Image 
Lorroakan, Act 3
        

An article of clothing with near unparalleled beauty, elegance, and grace, Shelter of Athkatla is undoubtedly one of the most cosmetically pleasing outfit options in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The wearer of this rare piece of armor will also benefit from a general resistance to spells, and the level two illusion spell Mirror Image.

 2  Weavemother&#39;s Robe Is A Very Stylish Choice 
Water Queen&#39;s House, Act 3


 







An exceptionally well-designed piece of armor, the Weavemother&#39;s Robe is a brilliant blue article of clothing with stitching that evokes images of dragon or fish scales.

 1  Cloth Of Authority Provides Resistance To Fear 
Enver Gortash, Act 3
        

The Cloth of Authority is quite possibly the best-designed article of clothing in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Beyond this, the rare piece of clothing comes with some great perks - Dauntless and Authority. This combination ensures that the player cannot be frightened and provides an advantage on all intimidation and insight checks. The only way to obtain this suave outfit is to forcefully take it from its initial wearer, Enver Gortash, during the quest &#34;Get Gortash&#39;s Netherstone.&#34; The Cloth of Authority is an elegantly designed costume that affords the player an air of majesty and grandeur - it is certainly one piece of clothing to add to Tav&#39;s wardrobe in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
