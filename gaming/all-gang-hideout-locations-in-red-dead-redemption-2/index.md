## Literature Review

Six different Gang Hideouts can all be found in different locations in Red Dead Redemption 2, with a bonus seventh camp also available to track down.





Stock up on healing items, weapon ammunition, and other items that might help you take out enemies at a Gang Hideout. These places have waves of gang members that will take cover and try to find positions to shoot you, with some bases having unique tricks that can be difficult to overcome. You only need to clear a Hideout once to complete it, even though foes there might respawn later.

                  10 Red Dead Redemption 2 Side Quests With The Best Rewards   With so many side quests to choose from, Red Dead Redemption 2 players will want to find the ones offering the best rewards.   


 O&#39;Driscoll Gang Hideout: Six Point Cabin 
          

The O&#39;Driscoll Gang&#39;s Hideout is actually found through RDR2&#39;s main story, in Chapter 2 of Red Dead Redemption 2. Wiping out the few O&#39;Driscoll members here is a fairly simple task, especially when you remain behind cover and rely on your allies to remove a few enemies. Eliminate a few foes stealthily to thin their numbers before a larger shootout, and keep this strategy in mind for other outposts in the future. 






You can check your progress on Gang Hideouts by going into the game&#39;s Missions And Events menu at any time during your adventures.






 Lemoyne Raiders Gang Hideout: Shady Belle 
          

While you encounter the Lemoyne Raiders gang in Chapter 3, their Hideout is a far more difficult battle than you faced in the main story. This gang has its base on a large plantation and is defended by many enemies with powerful firearms. You may need to obtain the best pistols or revolvers in Red Dead Redemption 2 before challenging the small army posted at this location.

You will need an excellent plan to wipe out the gang members here, so explore the area without drawing attention to see what cover you can use. There are plenty of places around the plantation that will break an enemy&#39;s line of sight in Red Dead Redemption 2. Loop around the main house as you begin fighting the Raiders to force them to leave their own safe areas right into your awaiting gunfire. 






 Murfree Brood Gang Hideout: Beaver Hollow 
          

The Hideout of the Murfree Brood gang is actually encountered in Chapter 5 of the story, but you have the chance to clear this base earlier while exploring Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s open world. Going to Annesburg, you can find a cave where the Brood hangs out and start taking out enemies just outside the cave. Make sure to find a good spot for cover before you start shooting in this somewhat unprotected area.

                  Every Red Dead Redemption 2 Town, Ranked   Red Dead Redemption 2 features various unique towns that players can visit and explore, but some, like Valentine, are more interesting than others.   

The Murfree Brood wields machetes and other melee weapons, making it best to use a long-range gun to remove these gang members. Eventually, you&#39;ll have to venture into the base&#39;s confined cave, forcing you to contend with their close-range fighting that could significantly injure Arthur. A Shotgun or a melee weapon of your own may even be the odds if you choose to bring either to the Hideout beforehand in Red Dead Redemption 2. 






 O&#39;Driscoll Gang Hideout: Hanging Dog Ranch 
          

The second O&#39;Driscoll Hideout comes about naturally through the story again, this time in Chapter 6 of Red Dead Redemption 2. Located on a relatively large ranch, this base is far more challenging than the one you cleared earlier. A Maxim Gun mounted in a barn&#39;s loft can shred through your health, but if you take control of this weapon, you can easily eliminate all the enemies at this Hideout with little effort. 



 Del Lobos Gang Hideout: Thieves Landing 
          

The Del Lobos Hideout is only accessible once you beat the main story and start the game&#39;s epilogue. Tackling this base is one of the best things to do after beating RDR2, and it is a huge challenge compared to other criminal havens you may have seen. The Del Lobos hide in a space that gives you few places to hide and few opportunities to perform stealth kills.




An excellent way to approach this Hideout is to circle around to the docks, which are secluded from the other base sections. This way, when you start shooting, Del Lobos members can&#39;t get behind you and trap you in a war on two fronts. Make sure to take your time and identify priority targets to shoot first with your Deadeye before engaging in a significant battle to clear the Hideout in Red Dead Redemption 2. 



 Del Lobos Gang Hideout: Fort Mercer 
          

The farthest Del Lobos Hideout is found at Fort Mercer, a nice callback to the original Red Dead Redemption that some players might remember. A military base like this is organized, well-defended, and must be challenged with plenty of patience. Take cover behind the main gate before taking out gang members on the outside of the fort to ensure you have fewer enemies to face when entering the Hideout. 






You may be able to take control of a Gatling Gun in the center of Fort Mercer that can quickly destroy any enemies in the area. This gun is in plain sight, so make sure not to rely too much on using a weapon where everyone can see you.






 Bonus Gang Hideout at Twin Rocks 
          

A seventh bonus Gang Hideout exists at Twin Rocks for anyone who purchased the Ultimate Edition of Red Dead Redemption 2. You should be able to travel here north of Armadillo, a settlement near Twin Rocks on your map. While you do not need to challenge this base to 100% complete the game, the extra loot given by enemies is a nice bit of extra content to expand the content of this huge RPG.

When you find all the Gang Hideout locations in Red Dead Redemption 2, you can always return to them and clear out enemies again for extra money and items needed to buy the rarest expensive gear in the game.
