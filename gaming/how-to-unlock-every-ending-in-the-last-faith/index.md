## Literature Review

The Last Faith has three different endings. You are normally only presented with the bad one. However, collecting items allows access to others.





Achieving different endings depends on key items in your current inventory. This does require some backtracking and collecting, a typical objective of many other Bloodborne-style pixel games. This is still faster and more concise than playing the entire game twice or thrice.

 How To Get The Last Faith&#39;s Three Endings 
          

The three endings depend on the mystical item, the pair of Esk’s Eyes. The left eye can be obtained in a single game run, while the right eye is gained after seeing the two original endings. This means that having both eyes at once is The Last Faith&#39;s True Ending, though if it is the good or best ending, it is up to personal interpretation.

Accept the Throne or Reject the Throne
The first decision that affects the ending is in the City of Erlim. You will encounter a merchant named The Veiled Maiden. Buy the “Second Skin” item from her wares for 10,000 Nycrux. This can either be a fair amount or a lot of currency. Depending on your build, you may want to first use the Nycrux to purchase a good weapon like Leena’s Bow in The Last Faith.

With the Second Skin gained, go to The Esk Mansion. Enter the room with the docile female ghost and speak to her. She will open a path to the left, leading deep into the mansion’s basement. You must defeat The Harbinger of Nightmares, a large hydra-like snake demon. Upon its demise, it will drop Esk’s Left Eye.

Proceed to the final encounter of The Last Faith at the Throne Room. The NPCs Caterina and Annabella will present you with ascending the throne. Under normal circumstances, you would have no choice but to “Accept the Throne” and get the first ending. But, now, with one of Esk’s Eyes, you will be given the option of “Reject the Throne” and receive the second possible ending.

True Ending Side Quest
After viewing the other two endings, a secret boss will unlock. Travel to the Damned Ruins of the Ossesus Fortress to access a new zone called Banks of the Moonshade Lake. The boss of this area is the Starlight Beast of Illygarth. It mainly fights up close with slashes and slam attacks but also has a few ice projectiles. This can either be a hard fight or easy, depending on the combat class you specialize in. Defeating it will yield Esk’s Right Eye.




With both eyes acquired, return to Caterina and Annabella. Once again, choose “Reject the Throne.” The two ladies will be very upset and attack you as the penultimate boss. Defeat the duo, and it will summon Medeya the Cosmic Voice, resulting in the true final encounter of The Last Faith. With them finally bested, Eryk will end the nightmare once and for all.
