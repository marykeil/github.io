The turn-based RPG tells the story of a group of heroes infected by illithid tadpoles.




Although there is a linear path to follow towards the end of the game, the title offers players a lot of freedom when it comes to making choices, thus altering the course of the story – depending on what is done, some companions will stop following the main character, while new ones can be recruited. Even tiny decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 can have huge story implications further down the road, and that sort of tightly woven narrative is also one of the game’s strongest suits. Now, the game is being offered in a special Deluxe Edition pack that comes with both physical and digital content for players to enjoy.

The product is available for PS5, Xbox, and PC – there are three versions of the Deluxe Edition, one for each platform.



Owners of Xbox Series S can still buy the product and enjoy its exclusive goodies. However, the physical copy of the game itself will not run on the console, as Series S does not have a disc reader.

                  One Baldur’s Gate 3 Change Might Save You From Committing A Massacre   There&#39;s one terrifyingly good reason to unleash bloodshed in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it looks like a change could render the violence unnecessary.   



 Baldur’s Gate 3 Deluxe Edition - Contents (Game, Map, Patches, &amp; More) 
          




The Deluxe Edition comes with special perks in comparison to the simple digital purchase. The first and most obvious is a physical copy of the game, depending on what version was bought. The PlayStation 5 version comes with two discs while the Xbox version of Baldur’s Gate 3 has three discs. The PC version of the game has a Steam serial key and a disc with an installer. All versions of the Deluxe Edition come with a physical version of the Original Game Soundtrack, composed of three CDs, as well as a double-sided map made from Wilbalin Buckram, a high-quality binding material with a cloth-like texture.



The map’s dimensions are 600 x 180 mm.




The special product also comes with 32 stickers that feature many elements of the game, including Origin characters, monsters from Dungeons and Dragons, references to the game, and Larian Studios. The Deluxe Edition offers two exclusive patches. The first one is for the Flaming Fist, while the second one is for the Mark of the Absolute from Baldur’s Gate 3. Perhaps one of the most notable physical perks is a large poster (570 x 690 mm) that features the art of a Mind Flayer. The last physical bonus is the Deluxe Edition’s box, which is a collectible created to fit the retro style of the first two games.




Although the physical products are the main selling point of the Deluxe Edition, the special version of the game also comes with in-game DLC and digital bonuses. The in-game DLC includes an item pack inspired by the characters and world of Divinity: Original Sin, another of Larian Studios’ franchises. There is also an exclusive dice skin in Baldur’s Gate 3 that comes with the Deluxe Edition, offering players a chance to roll in a fresh and different style. Another in-game DLC content is the Bard Song Pack, which allows those who choose bards to play a special set of new songs.

The Deluxe Edition also features exclusive in-game painting inspired by Divinity: Original Sin 2, which can be found and then, perhaps, set as decorations in camp. The product also comes with an Adventurer’s Pouch, which features camp supplies and potions that can substantially help when kicking off a new adventure in Faerûn. Among the digital bonuses of the Deluxe Edition are also a digital copy of the Original Soundtrack (OST), a digital copy of the art book from Larian Studios, and digital character sheets for each of the Origin characters in Baldur’s Gate 3. Each character sheet has four pages of content based on the mechanics of D&amp;D.






 Differences Between Baldur’s Gate 3 Deluxe Edition &amp; Collector’s Edition 
          

The Deluxe Edition differs from the Collector’s Edition of Baldur’s Gate 3 in many ways. Before being sold out, the Collector&#39;s Edition was a more premium version of the product and, while it does not offer a physical copy of the game, it features an exclusive 160-page hardcover art book, a metal tadpole keyring, a booster pack for Magic: The Gathering, a custom-engraved metal d20 (and an in-game version of the dice), and a certificate of authenticity. The most astonishing piece in the Collector&#39;s Edition, however, is the 25 cm statuette featuring a Drow battling a Mind Flayer. The digital bonuses and in-game DLC content are shared among the products.

The Collector’s Edition also came with a custom sticker sheet, a cloth map of the game, character sheets for Origin characters, and a digital copy of the game. In a sense, the Deluxe Edition is a mid-tier product that stands between the premium experience of the Collector’s Edition and the base version of the game. The Deluxe Edition of Baldur’s Gate 3 is now available for preorder on the official website.
