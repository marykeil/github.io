## Literature Review

Theater Tickets in Genshin Impact can grant you a special and limited weapon, as well as many Primogems. Here’s how to get the most out of them.





Many mini-games, such as a sniper mode and even a filming challenge, can be played throughout Roses and Muskets. This is the same version that finally introduced Navia. Though she had been present as an NPC in previous updates, she is now fully playable if you are lucky enough to pull her from the character banners in Genshin Impact 4.3. Chevreuse also made her debut, both as an NPC and playable character in the current version.




                  Genshin Impact: Chevreuse Character Ascension (&amp; Materials)   You will need to farm a lot of materials to fully Ascend Chevreuse and her Talents in Genshin Impact. Here’s everything you need to gather.   


 How To Farm Theater Tickets In Genshin Impact 
          

To acquire Theater Ticket points in Genshin Impact, you must participate in the mini-game modes in the Roses and Muskets event. There are four mini-game modes: Sharpshooting Zone, Xtreme Drive, Into the Frame, and Trick Shots, Tricky Lights. The first is a sniper mode, while the second is a multiplayer-only party game. The third mode will make you edit a movie, while the last is a battle mode. These mini-games have several stages or completion tiers, all of which grant Theater Tickets. The maximum amount of Theater Tickets you can acquire is 1,600. The cap for rewards with Theater Tickets, however, is 1,200.






The cap is lower than the maximum number of points, which is a way of allowing you to grab all the Theater Ticket rewards without having to necessarily max out every single mini-game.






 All Theater Ticket Rewards In Genshin Impact 
          

As you get more Theater Tickets, you will unlock prizes in the Joyous Gift portion of the event card. The main reward to claim by using Theater Tickets is the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword in Genshin Impact. This is an event-exclusive 4-star claymore that can only be acquired through the Roses and Muskets event. 200 Theater Tickets are needed to claim the weapon. As you progress through the reward tiers, you will also get Primogems, Character EXP materials, weapon enhancement materials, and, most importantly, the Refinement materials for the event’s special weapon.




                  Genshin Impact: Navia Character Builds (Weapons, Artifacts, Team Comps)   You can increase Navia’s value as a DPS unit in Genshin Impact with the best build and ideal team comp to accompany her on-field Geo presence.   

The table below lists all the rewards obtained with Theater Tickets, divided per tier:

 All Theater Ticket Rewards (Joyous Gift)   Theater Tickets (Tiers)  Rewards   200 Theater Tickets    Ultimate Overlord&#39;s Mega Magic Sword (Exclusive 4-star claymore)      400 Theater Tickets    60x Primogems   1x Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal   3x Hero&#39;s Wit   6x Mystic Enhancement Ore      600 Theater Tickets    60x Primogems   1x Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal   3x Hero&#39;s Wit   6x Mystic Enhancement Ore      800 Theater Tickets    60x Primogems   1x Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal   3x Hero&#39;s Wit   6x Mystic Enhancement Ore      1,000 Theater Tickets    60x Primogems   1x Super-Duper Invincible Shining Sparkly Magic Crystal   3x Hero&#39;s Wit   6x Mystic Enhancement Ore      1,200 Theater Tickets    60x Primogems   1x Crown of Insight   3x Hero&#39;s Wit   6x Mystic Enhancement Ore      



The Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword and its Refinement materials are probably the best rewards in the Theater Ticket prize bunch, but the rare Crown of Insight and the many Primogems offered by simply gathering Theater Tickets should not be overlooked. Big flagship events like Roses and Muskets should always be maxed out, as they hand out a satisfying amount of great rewards in Genshin Impact.
