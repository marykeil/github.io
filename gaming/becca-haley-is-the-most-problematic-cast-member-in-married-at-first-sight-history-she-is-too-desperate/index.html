  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Becca&rsquo;s hyper-focus on sex is causing strain in her marriage with Austin, as she is not respecting his boundaries and only cares about her own needs.
Becca&rsquo;s behavior is seen as more problematic than previous cast members on Married at First Sight, as she disregards Austin&rsquo;s feelings and puts pressure on him without considering the positive aspects of their connection.
The future of Becca and Austin&rsquo;s marriage is uncertain, as their ability to have a successful relationship seems to be dependent on whether they will be able to have sex. If Becca continues with her demands or if she walks away unsatisfied, it is likely they will not stay together on Decision Day.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Married at First Sight season 17 cast member Becca Haley has displayed a lot of problematic behavior that&rsquo;s worse than cast members past.</p>
<p>Married at First Sight season 17&rsquo;s Becca Haley has displayed some very problematic behavior in her marriage with Austin Reed. Becca, 31, is a wedding photographer who was hoping to find someone who could see past her physical ailments. Becca described that she has multiple medical issues, including endometriosis and an autoimmune disorder, which have impacted her ability to do certain activities. Becca had surgery shortly before her wedding to relieve some of her problems, but she was still recovering on the honeymoon.</p>
<p>Becca also doesn&rsquo;t drink. She was paired with Austin, 32, who describes himself as a typical Colorado guy. He likes to drink, be outdoors, and be adventurous, and he is an only child who comes from a home with both his parents. Austin was looking for the typical American life when asking for a partner from the Married at First Sight experts. Sex-positive Becca has been holding a lot of weight in her physical connection with Austin so far, and it&rsquo;s impacted their ability to connect on other topics.</p>

<p>Becca &amp; Austin Seemed Perfect For Each Other</p>
<p>On their wedding day, Becca and Austin had palpable chemistry, as they could not stop kissing each other during the wedding and reception. They also quickly found out that they both have quirky personalities with the same odd sense of humor. They laughed a lot together during the honeymoon and did a lot of hand-holding and kissing. They seemed like the most compatible couple during the honeymoon and shortly after.</p>
<p>Moreover, the morning after their wedding day, Becca explained her health issues to Austin and how they impacts her day-to-day life. She described how she felt like a burden to previous partners and that Austin would need to understand her limitations. Austin listened to Becca&rsquo;s health explanation and let her know that he would be there for her and never make her feel like a burden. Since then, the pair have been trying to grow their relationship, but Becca&rsquo;s been too hyper-focused on sex with Austin.</p>
<p>Becca Doesn&rsquo;t Respect Austin&rsquo;s Boundaries Around Sex</p>
<p>Austin has said on many occasions that he wants to take his time with intimacy and not rush into having sex. Becca has not been a good listener or receptive to Austin&rsquo;s reservations and has even complained about their lack of intimacy to the Married at First Sight season 17 group on several occasions (via E! News). Becca has brought up wanting to have sex during their therapy sessions as well. Austin has said he&rsquo;s open to trying other intimate things but is not ready for sex, but Becca has not been okay with what Austin is comfortable giving.</p>
<p>Becca is clearly not respecting Austin&rsquo;s boundaries when it comes to his pace in wanting to engage in intimacy. Instead of being understanding, she is taking his viewpoints personally and making herself feel defeated. She is putting so much weight into them not having sex that she is disregarding how good their relationship has been. By not recognizing the good points in their connection and only focusing on Austin not satisfying her sex needs, Becca is ruining her marriage.</p>
<p>Becca&rsquo;s Problematic Behavior Is Worse Than Previous MAFS Cast Members</p>
<p>Becca has been relentless in her complaints about Austin wanting to take things at a slower pace (via E! News). She completely disregards how Austin feels and is selfish by only caring about her point of view. She has not been trying to make Austin feel comfortable about having intimacy with her and is more than likely intimidating him and turning him off with her constant requests and breakdowns about not having sex. Not only is Becca putting pressure on her husband, but she&rsquo;s also not respecting boundaries.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of villainous Married at First Sight cast members over the 17 seasons of the hit Lifetime show, but Becca is coming out on top of that list because of her relentless behavior. Season 14 cast member Olajuwon Dickerson was problematic for his insistence on gender roles and harsh words for his wife. Season 15&rsquo;s Binh Trinh could not keep his wife&rsquo;s trust, and season 16&rsquo;s Mitch Silverstein made his wife feel bad about her appearance.</p>
<p>While Becca is not doing those exact things, what she&rsquo;s doing to Austin is on the same level, if not worse. She is embarrassing herself at this point and damaging the connection she built with Austin, possibly beyond repair. Becca has not appreciated Austin&rsquo;s patience, affection, or the way he cares for her because she is only focused on intimacy. She is presenting as majorly problematic and perhaps the most problematic cast member in Married at First Sight history because she can&rsquo;t appreciate what she has.</p>
<p>Will Becca &amp; Austin Say Yes On Decision Day?</p>
<p>There are only a few Married at First Sight episodes left until Decision Day, which means on the show the couples only have a few weeks left in the experience. Come Decision Day, the pair will sit down in front of the experts and talk about the good and bad points in their marriage before they make a decision about staying together or divorcing. Based on the trailer for the next episode, Becca will share a hot tub moment with Austin, where she will praise him for his commitment.</p>
<p>However, later in the preview, Becca was filmed crying about feeling &ldquo;days and nights of rejection&rdquo; from Austin before Married at First Sight expert Pastor Cal Roberson asks her if she still wanted to be in a marriage with Austin. Becca was shown crying and shaking her head, but viewers didn&rsquo;t get her final answer. In the mid-season trailer. during what appears to be that same interaction with Pastor Cal, Austin will say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; when seemingly asked if he was ready to have sex with Becca.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become crystal clear that whether Becca and Austin&rsquo;s marriage will work out depends on whether they will have sex. If Becca pushes Austin away before Decision Day with her sex demands or walks away herself from feeling unsatisfied, it will prove they did not have a solid foundation to begin with. Austin has appeared committed to Becca despite her incessancy, but he can only take so much. Married at First Sight&rsquo;s Becca and Austin are likely to say no to each other on Decision Day, given their current circumstances.</p>
