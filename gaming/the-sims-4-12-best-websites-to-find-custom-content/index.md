## Literature Review

These platforms, including Tumblr and YouTube, are the best places to find the latest and greatest custom content for The Sims 4.




Every player knows that The Sims is an expensive franchise to be a fan of, but searching out websites that offer custom content can be a good way to avoid burdening a wallet. Since its creation in 2014, The Sims 4 has created many additional content DLCs, with more being added regularly. The cost of all of these add-ons can quickly add up, totaling over $1,000. Custom content, also known as CC, offers a perfect alternative to still getting fun new furniture and extras for the game without the price tag. Created by fellow players and shared for free across the web, CC allows players to flesh out The Sims 4 without breaking the bank. 
 The Sims 4 currently has 15 expansion packs, 12 game packs, 19 stuff packs, and 25 kits at the time of writing,  

New players who have joined The Sims 4 community since the game became free to play in October 2022, or those who have never dipped their toes into custom content and mods, may be overwhelmed and wondering where to find Sims 4 CC. Even experienced CC users may be installing their The Sims 4 custom content from one or two sites, but there is a wide variety of options available. From Tumblr to CurseForge, there are plenty of places to source high-quality CC for the perfect Sims 4 experience.
            
 
 How Much The Sims 4 Costs in 2023 
The game will soon turn nine, and it has certainly amassed no shortage of DLCs along the way. Here&#39;s the total cost of all Sims 4 expansions in 2023.












 








 Tumblr 
A Great Location To Find New CC Creators
 Perhaps the most useful source when it comes to finding quality custom content is Tumblr, a social media platform home to a vibrant community of Sims players. Tumblr is the perfect place for modders and custom content creators as it allows them to post images of their creations, advertise their other platforms, such as Patreon, and make friends and valuable connections in the community. The Sims side of Tumblr even has its own nickname: Simblr. The community is thriving, with content creators often holding special events — most notably Simblreen, a yearly Halloween event when users are encouraged to send their favorite creators a &#34;Trick or Treat&#34; message to receive free, exclusive CC pieces. Tumblr is free to join and browse, making it the perfect place for new Sims 4 players to dip their toes into custom content and even make a friend or two along the way.
It can be overwhelming for those with no previous experience of Tumblr so try starting with a search for &#34;Sims 4 CC&#34; in the Tumblr search bar. 






 Llama CC Finds 
 A Rolling Feed Of Quality Sims 4 Content


 







If the world of Tumblr feels overwhelming, some blogs that exist within Tumblr can help curate things down to a more simple format that is great for new searchers of Sims 4 CC. One of the most significant and well-known of these is Llama CC Finds, which is an extensive resource that has been around since the Sims 2 days. Llama CC Finds takes away some of the work of searching through all the Tumblr shares and updates regularly throughout each day to highlight the best creations. 
Llama CC Finds also has a useful navigation system at the top of its blog to help players find the exact type of content they&#39;re looking for, as well as separate areas for custom content geared towards Sims 3 or Sims 2 CC. The blog shares a wide variety of cool The Sims 4 custom content, including Maxis Match; content that blends seamlessly with The Sims 4&#39;s art style — and Alpha Creations, designed to be more hyper-realistic in style.
            
 
 The Best (&amp; Coolest) Custom Content for Sims 4 
Talented and dedicated content creators continue to make cool and functional Custom Content for The Sims 4. Here are some of the best packs available.








 Maxis Match World CC 
An Archive Of Sims 4 Content
        

If players prefer Maxis Match content that fits in with existing content in The Sims 4, then Maxis Match World CC is the perfect Tumblr blog to browse. Sadly, they have stopped updating the blog as of August 2023, yet there is a lot available on the site, which makes it worth a look, and their X (formerly known as Twitter) account is still active in reposting content. Much like Llama CC Finds, Maxis Match World aggregated content from all over Tumblr into one handy, well-organized blog.
The key difference is that the blog only shares Maxis Match content, which is a drawback for those looking for Alpha CC. There&#39;s a dedicated navigation page that shows the scale of the CC on offer. Everything from Build/Buy objects to hair and accessories can be found on the blog.





 Around The Sims 4 
 A Well-Organized Resource


 







Like Llama CC Finds, Around the Sims 4 is a site with a long legacy behind it. The roots of Around The Sims trace back to the first Sims game, building a strong legacy that assures quality and safety with all of the available content. Most of the content is archived, with only the past 30 days showing on the homepage, making it a much less overwhelming option for those who can have a hard time with overstimulation. 
The origins of Around the Sims can be seen in the website design, which is slightly more old-fashioned than many. However, it still operates as a straightforward blog, so the lack of modern graphic design touches has minimal impact on navigation. The site&#39;s archive features stretch back to the game&#39;s launch in 2014. Content from Around the Sims can also be found on Tumblr and Patreon.





 Patreon 
Support Your Favorite CC Creators
        

Patreon is a site that allows creators of all types to build a following through memberships. In recent years, it&#39;s been adopted by those creating Sims 4 custom content as a way to generate income as followers can sign up for membership tiers, paying a (usually) small fee to get early access to their content. However, The Sims&#39; policies on the EA website state that custom content and mods can&#39;t be hidden behind a paywall forever. Any unofficial content like the CC posted to Patreon still becomes free after a certain amount of time. Patreon is easy to use, so keeping up to date with a high-quality creator is simple. 





 ModTheSims 
A Good Resource For Gameplay Mods
        

A veteran Sims platform that&#39;s no doubt familiar to long-time players is ModTheSims. While The Sims is by no means a game that is unplayable without mods, they help to enhance it. ModTheSims, was originally established in the days of The Sims 2 and is a community hub where creators can share their Sims 4 creations, both mods, and CC. Though arguably a bit more dated in style than more recent forums and community hubs, ModTheSims is still a valuable resource for The Sims 4. As the name suggests, ModTheSims is primarily for gameplay mods rather than aesthetic-based CC, but players can still find high-quality gems on the site.

 Pinterest 
A Useful Organizational Tool As a visual platform, Pinterest is a great place to find CC if looking to give characters in The Sims 4 a makeover, and it&#39;s a platform that many may already be familiar with. Finding content is easy, with a simple search for &#34;Sims 4 CC&#34; returning thousands of results. It has the added benefit of allowing users to organize custom content into different boards, too — so personal boards for everything from hair to shoes can be compiled to return to later. The only downside is that, as content is reposted from other sites like Tumblr, users may be sent on wild goose chase following links to content that may no longer exist or be unsupported by its original creator. Some sleuthing may be involved, but Pinterest should be considered for its organizational options alone.





 The Sims Resource 
Wide Selection Of CC
        

The Sims Resource (TSR) is another thriving community for Sims 4 custom content and mod creators. Controversial for its membership options, it&#39;s still a valuable resource for those willing to sit through a few adverts to retrieve the content they want. TSR started back in 1999, six months before the first The Sims game was even released, and for many years, it was the number one name in finding any content or information related to the game. 
TSR is home to some of the most impressive creators in the community, showcasing everything from CC eyebrows and nails to clothing sets and cars. The site can be overwhelming at first, and some features are locked for non-members, but it soon becomes clear how to navigate the site to get the most out of it.





 Sims4Updates 
Easy To Navigate
        

Sims4Updates is similar to the Tumblr blogs previously discussed, but it is hosted on a separate site. It functions much the same way as Llama CC Finds and Maxis Match World, curating a collection of exciting CC for players to browse. Unfortunately, the website has the disadvantage of being littered with ads that can sometimes hinder the experience. Nevertheless, it&#39;s another important resource and worth a browse when looking for a new CC to spice up a Sim&#39;s looks or furnish a good house layout in The Sims 4, whether a humble abode or a mega-mansion.





 SimTuber Recommendations 
Popular Sims 4 Influencers
        

The Sims also has a thriving community on YouTube. There are some great Sims 4 YouTubers, also known as SimTubers, who are well worth a follow for those looking for new custom content. Big-name SimTubers like Elliandra and Vixella regularly do custom content showcases and CC shopping videos with links to the creations. CC shopping through YouTube is a great place to start, as not only can players get links to all the content, but they can see how it looks in-game without having to go through the hassle of downloading and adding it to their own mods folder first.

 The Sims Catalog 
 A Huge Repository 


 







The Sims Catalog provides an easy way to browse The Sims 4 CC from a wide variety of creators. It features handy simplified categories and a site-wide search function that lets searches be narrowed down to exactly the type of custom content wanted. The operation of the website as an aggregate service does mean that some downloads will be more accessible than others, however. Some CC can be directly downloaded from the site, while many use links to other websites.
Content shown on the site may be locked behind Patreon pages, so frugal Sims 4 players may find themselves bookmarking some CC found on The Sims Catalog until it becomes free. 






 CurseForge 
The Official Source
        

The Sims 4 also has a dedicated page on Overwolf&#39;s CurseForge platform. Advertised as the &#34;official mods hub&#34; for The Sims 4, it&#39;s a great place for players to find new CC and mods, although its official status means that CurseForge mods have many restrictions that may not be found on other sites. Though perhaps not as well known among The Sims fans as other CC shopping platforms, CurseForge is a place to find all The Sims 4&#39;s biggest and best creators in one place. While not solely dedicated to CC, lots of excellent custom content can be found on the platform, and it helps to foster a sense of community with dedicated social media pages and even a Discord server for fans to chat about mods, CC, and the game at large.
