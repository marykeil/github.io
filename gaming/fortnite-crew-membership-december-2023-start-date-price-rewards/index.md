## Literature Review

The final Fortnite Crew Pack of 2023 arrives in December, featuring the new Skull Scout Outfit and some great bonus perks, including free V-Bucks.





November’s Fortnite Crew Pack remains available until 7PM EST on November 30th when it leaves the game for good, so make sure to grab your rewards if you’re a subscriber. Luckily, although Fortnite’s pricing has been trending upward in some regions, the price of a subscription remains unchanged: $11.99 (£9.99, €9.99) a month. In return, you’ll receive a Crew Pack each month with cosmetics you can keep forever.

According to Fortnite on X, Fortnite Crew subscribers will receive Skull Scout as the new Outfit in the December Crew Pack.

It’s worth noting that recent Fortnite Crew Pack Outfits also came with a set of matching cosmetics, and players are guaranteed to receive at least one accessory, such as a pickaxe or wrap. As of writing, no extra cosmetics for Skull Scout have actually been confirmed. However, the promotional image seems to suggest Skull Scout’s knife might be a pickaxe.

Recent Packs have also released Outfits with additional Fortnite Crew Legacy Styles. After receiving an Outfit, subscribers can receive alternate Styles for that Outfit by subscribing for more than a month. Previous Crew Pack Outfits have had up to five Legacy Styles, with a new Style unlocking each month.






Legacy Styles are a recent addition to the Fortnite Crew Packs, so it’s likely that the Skull Scout Outfit will have them. However, they haven’t been officially confirmed for December 2023.






 All Bonus Benefits In The December 2023 Fortnite Crew Pack 
          

On top of the Crew Pack cosmetics, additional bonus benefits are also available:

  Access to the current premium Fortnite Battle Pass.   1,000 V-Bucks to spend in the Item Shop.   Rocket Pass Premium for Rocket League.  

Subscribers are guaranteed to receive access to the premium track of the current battle pass, which contains dozens of rewards and packs of free V-Bucks. Rewards are all cosmetic-only and don’t grant any advantages when it comes to landing on the Fortnite island.



Fortnite Season OG comes to an end on December 2nd, so it might be worth waiting to see what’s included in next season’s battle pass.







          

Bundled in with Fortnite’s Battle Pass is Rocket Pass Premium for Rocket League. This is essentially Rocket League’s premium battle pass, with lots of rewards for fans of car soccer. It’s a neat bonus for anyone who already plays the game and gives you a reason to try it if you haven’t. Two battle passes for a relatively low price is arguably a good deal for anyone who likes to earn cosmetics in Epic’s free-to-play games.

Finally, subscribers also get 1,000 V-Bucks. These can be spent in the Item Shop, or saved up for more expensive crossover cosmetic bundles when they arrive. Fortnite’s best cosmetics can often be surprisingly expensive, so it might be worth subscribing to the Fortnite Crew for the V-Bucks alone, especially if you play regularly and enjoy collecting cosmetics.
