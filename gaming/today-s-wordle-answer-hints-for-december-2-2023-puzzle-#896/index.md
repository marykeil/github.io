## Literature Review

December 2nd’s Wordle answer has a repeating letter and a very complex spelling that will throw off many players.





To solve answers with repeating letters, it is recommended to use Wordle’s hard mode to prevent the usage of random guesses. While this mode cannot tell if there are any repeating letters, its mechanics will prevent you from reusing confirmed letters in different spots. However, you can still find it challenging to solve the puzzle if you aren’t careful, but perhaps using some hints might help.
