# Why You re Missing One EMF Experiment In Marvel s Spider-Man 2


## SUMMARY 






  The Emily-May Foundation experiments directly contribute to Peter and Harry&#39;s goal of healing the world and have different departments for research.   Completing all EMF experiments unlocks a new suit based on the Spider-Man: Life Story comic, featuring Peter and Miles in matching spacesuits.   One EMF experiment is only unlocked after completing all 8 prior ones and Spider-Man 2&#39;s main campaign.

## Literature Review

The last EMF experiment won&#39;t appear until after Spider-Man 2&#39;s story ends, which may confuse those looking to get 100% completion before its finale.




There&#39;s no shortage of side activities in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, with an abundance of suits for both Peter and Miles often unlocked as a reward for completing them. While some side activities such as &#34;The Flame&#34; can function somewhat independently of the game&#39;s main narrative, and act as a way to set up a potential future DLC storyline, others such as the Emily-May Foundation experiments feed directly into Peter Parker and Harry Osborn&#39;s main aspirations to &#34;heal the world&#34;.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.]

Despite Peter and Mary Jane believing their friend Harry was traveling Europe in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, he was later revealed to be in a medically-induced coma with the Venom symbiote as part of his treatment for the same terminal illness his mother Emily passed away from years prior. By the start of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Harry has been released from this treatment and seems healthier than ever, with a completely new lease on life.

                  What Happens To Venom &amp; The Symbiote In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Venom and the Symbiote are a core narrative component in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but what really happens to it throughout the duration of the game?   


 The EMF Intends To &#34;Heal The World&#34; 
         




When Harry visits Peter in Queens, he offers him the position of Co-CEO at a new start-up of his, the Emily-May Foundation, which has been named in loving memory of Harry&#39;s mother, and Peter&#39;s recently deceased aunt, May Parker. The intent is to continue the work the two friends had begun and were supposed to debut at the Young Entrepreneurs convention back in High School but put on hold after Emily died. As Harry underwent his treatment, his father Norman Osborn officially created and funded the foundation as an Oscorp subsidiary, so it was ready for his son once he was back in good health.

The EMF&#39;s plan to &#34;heal the world&#34; covers many areas, with Dr. Curt Connors managing a Medical team, the Ichthyology team studying Japanese Koi fish for research into enhanced reflectivity, and an Astronomy department dedicated to scanning space and the atmosphere for any toxins or dangers to the environment. There are also three further departments that Peter can assist directly via a series of mini-games found at portable labs across the city.






 What Are The EMF Experiments In Spider-Man 2?

To assist the Entomology team, Dr. Young has created drones to defend bee hives from predators, and Peter takes control of these to train them in holographic simulations in real-world locations. Peter can help Dr. Foster&#39;s Agriculture team via puzzles similar to the Octavius Industries ones in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, which works to create hybrid plants that can survive in different environments and therefore produce more food to counter world hunger. An Energy department run by Dr. Nguyen is dedicated to finding clean power alternatives, and to assist this team, Peter tests a new kind of battery-powered bike in a race-type mission in Central Park and uses his web-wings and a series of wind tunnels to deploy turbines in Downtown Brooklyn.



Players can simplify these Agriculture puzzles via the Gameplay and Accessibility Options menus, or skip them entirely via the Pause menu once activating them.







Players will get a tutorial in the Entomology and Agriculture mini-games when Peter visits the Emily-May Foundation for the first time during the main mission &#34;Healing the World&#34;. After this mission is complete, EMF experiments will begin to appear as side objectives across Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s New York map. The eight experiments are as follows:

 Location  Mission Type   Little Tokyo F.E.A.S.T Center (Chinatown)  Agriculture   Portside F.E.A.S.T Center (Hell&#39;s Kitchen)  Agriculture   Two Bridges F.E.A.S.T Center (Financial District)  Agriculture   Central Park (Border of Upper West Side)  Entomology   Queens Apiary (Little Odessa)  Entomology   Prospect Park (Downtown Brooklyn)  Entomology   Central Park (Border of Harlem)  Energy   Brooklyn Heights (Downtown Brooklyn)  Energy   








Each of these EMF experiments rewards 700 XP, 140 Tech Parts, and 3 Rare Tech Parts.






 There&#39;s A Hidden Final EMF Experiment In Spider-Man 2

There is one additional Emily-May Foundation experiment that won&#39;t appear until after the game&#39;s campaign is completed, however, which may frustrate those looking to achieve 100% completion before going past the &#34;Point of No Return&#34; and triggering the final boss battle against Venom, especially as all other side activities can be completed by this point. The reason this final experiment doesn&#39;t appear, however, is because it serves as an epilogue to the heartbreaking end of Harry Osborn&#39;s story and the conclusion to the EMF side-mission.






All 8 EMF experiments must also be completed before the final one at Peter&#39;s home is unlocked.




Although the main Emily-May Foundation is destroyed during Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Peter reveals to Mary Jane that he has set up their garage with the intent to keep the company running - albeit at a much smaller scale - as he goes on a hiatus from being Spider-Man, letting Miles take over as the city&#39;s main superhero for a while. Mary Jane will call Peter to let him know a package has arrived from Norman Osborn, and upon visiting Peter&#39;s home in the Astoria district of Queens, players will find a box that contains a piece of bark from the tree dedicated to Emily, and some blossoms dedicated to May alongside a thumb-drive with a final message from Harry to Peter.

Harry&#39;s message suggests gene-splicing the two plants together in a similar way to the other Agriculture experiments to create a strong enough plant that can produce seeds. Once players have finished this puzzle, Harry explains that the drones used in Entomology could plant the seeds around the city, and a demonstration shows how this tribute to Emily and May will grow over the years in major parks across the city.

 What Does The Final EMF Experiment Unlock?

Completing all the Emily-May Foundation experiments rewards players with the &#34;Foundational&#34; Trophy, 1000 XP, and 200 Tech Parts. There is also a suit for Peter based on Chip Zdarsky and Mark Bagley&#39;s six-part Spider-Man: Life Story that is gifted to Peter at the end of Harry&#39;s message.

Life Story was a celebration of Spider-Man&#39;s impressive comic history and showed Peter being bitten by a radioactive spider in 1962 - the year in which Spider-Man was created - before aging in real-time over the decades. Each of the six issues covered a different decade and incorporated reworked versions of major events, such as the death of Gwen Stacy in the &#39;70s and the introduction of Miles Morales in the 2010s. Peter&#39;s costume also went through several changes over the years, but the one featured in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is the spacesuit he wore in the final issue alongside Miles, who has a matching suit in-game.
