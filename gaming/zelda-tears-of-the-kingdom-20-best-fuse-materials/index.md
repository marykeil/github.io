# Zelda Tears of the Kingdom - 20 Best Fuse Materials


## SUMMARY 

![iamge](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-20-best-fuse-materials.jpg)

## Literature Review

There are hundreds of Fuse materials available in Tears of the Kingdom. Some are better for beginners while others are used best with endgame items.





Keep in mind that not every Fuse item should be paired with weapons in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Ingredient materials such as Chuchu Jelly are wasted on melee tools, but are best used as attachments for Link&#39;s many arrows. The two most important aspects of a Fuse material are how easy it is to find in the massive open-world, and the potential strength it can bring when infused into other items.
For the purposes of this list, each material will be rated out of 5 stars for how easy it is to find the item, and the potential strength of the resource for different fusions. A high score for both means that a Fuse material is easy to find and can make items incredibly strong. 

            
 
 Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 10 Best Fused Weapons 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom weapon fusions will give Link more offensive or power. Some melds are better against bosses or small groups.












 








 20  Amber 
The Beginner&#39;s Favorite Rock
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★★★     Fusion Potential    ★    
One of the best early Fuse materials in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is Amber due to its great damage buff for items found at the start of the game. Most monsters at the beginning of your journey can defeat Link in one or two hits, which makes it hard to collect other resources for fusion. The &#43;4 damage increase provided by Amber can easily be put on a Tree Branch or Stick to make fighting enemies far easier.





 19  Light Dragon Materials 
Majestic Resources


 







   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★★     Fusion Potential    ★    
The Light Dragon is best known as the resting place of the Master Sword in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but it provides its fair share of monster parts for Link&#39;s weapons. Light Dragon Scales, Spikes, and other resources give a &#43;12 damage bonus to any weapons Link chooses to fuse the material into. It may be a bit difficult to land on the Dragon, but it is easier to find than other flying beasts in Hyrule.





 18  Blue Moblin Horn 
Worth the Challenge
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★    
Blue Moblins are very tough enemies Link can encounter early in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but these creatures provide better Monster Parts as a result of their difficulty. A Blue Moblin Horn can be fused into a weapon to give it &#43;13 damage. This resource is extremely straightforward, and should only be used to make weapons stronger instead of being put into elixirs.





 17  Frox Fang 
Deep in the Dark
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★    
A Frox Fang is very similar to a Blue Moblin Horn, since it comes from a dangerous creature Link will have to fight in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Providing a &#43;14 damage bonus, this item is only found deep within caverns or giant chasms found in Hyrule. This makes it a strange resource to collect until you are more competent exploring the darker reaches of the enormous open-world.





 16  Fire/Ice/Electric-Breath Lizalfos Horn 
Elemental Mayhem
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★    
The Lizalfos Horns in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are Monster Parts that come in many shapes and sizes. Fire-Breath, Ice-Breath, and Electric-Breath Lizalfos Horns give &#43;15 damage to weapons if you can defeat the elemental enemies attached to them. The Gerudo Desert has an abundance of Lizalfos to defeat in order to gain these items, as well as the Eldin and Hebra Mountains.





 15  Blue Boss Bokoblin Horn 
Beat the Boss, Become the Boss
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★    
Behind every group of Bokoblin enemies in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a blue or red Bokoblin Boss that can drop a Horn when defeated. A Blue Boss Bokoblin Horn can be put onto a weapon to give it &#43;16 damage as an excellent reward for taking down such a hostile leader. Make sure to only challenge a Blue Bokoblin Boss when you get Link some more Hearts, so you don&#39;t get killed in a single hit.
If you want to find out where to farm Boss Bokoblin drops early in the game, check out this video from YouTube creator SEA Frog Gaming to see where these enemies can be found in Hyrule! 








 14  Captain Construct Horns 
Familiar Machines
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★    
Link begins their adventure fighting Soldier Construct and Captain Construct enemies in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. As you start to come across higher level versions of these foes, they drop items like the Captain Construct II Horn with III and IV variants. The buffs from these items are higher than most Fuse materials, with &#43;15 damage coming from the Horn II even growing to a &#43;25 bonus from the III or IV versions.





 13  Dinraal Monster Parts 
Dragon of Fire
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★    
One of the dragons that flies around Hyrule is named Dinraal, and hosts Fuse materials in the same way as the Light Dragon. Dinraal Spikes can give a weapon &#43;16 damage, while Dinraal&#39;s Horn has the potential to buff your tools by &#43;24 damage. Putting either of these parts onto an item in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gives it a fire effect that is strong against Ice themed enemies in colder environments.





 12  Black Bokoblin Horn 
Toughest Bokoblin Yet
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★    
Black Bokoblins are a step above the standard enemies of the same type that you encounter in Hyrule. As you might expect, this means that Black Bokoblin Horns are much better Monster Parts to fuse with a &#43;17 damage bonus in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. By the time you meet these enemies in the game, you will have far better ways to take them down to collect these items without any problems.





 11  Gleeok Guts 
Three Potential Paths


 







   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★    
Multi-headed dragons called Gleeoks in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are formidable foes tied to elemental damage types seen in the game. These mini-bosses found in the world drop incredible Fuse materials in the form of Gleeok Guts for a variety of uses. You can apply the item to a weapon for a &#43;24 damage bonus, sell it for a high price, or mix it into an elixir for a potent effect for Link.





 10  Diamond 
Rarest and Greatest Ore
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
One of the hardest ores to find in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are Diamonds that can be fused onto weapons for a &#43;25 damage bonus. Those early in their adventure could get lucky and find a couple Diamonds that spawn deep within a cave. Thankfully, you don&#39;t have to battle a boss to collect this resource, but you will have to decide if you want to sell it for 500 Rupees instead of using it on a fusion.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom weapon fusions will give Link more offensive or power. Some melds are better against bosses or small groups.








 9  Black Lizalfos Horn 
Back in Black
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
The Black Lizalfos is the next step from the elemental breathing enemies you may fight earlier in your Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom journey. The Black Lizalfos Horn nearly doubles the potential of the previous item, and gives you a &#43;26 damage bonus when fused onto a weapon. Once again, selling this resource or putting it into an elixir would be a waste.





 8  Black Boss Bokoblin Horn 
Commander&#39;s Crown
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
A Black Boss Bokoblin Horn gives weapons a &#43;27 damage bonus for yet another Fuse material that should not be cast aside in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. These leaders of Bokoblin armies have the same weaknesses as their minions, making them easier to defeat in battle than you might expect.
Black Boss Bokoblins are notoriously hard to find, since they wander across Hyrule instead of staying with a group of enemies. Go ahead and watch this video from YouTube creator Mixeli to learn the location of all bosses found in the overworld! 








 7  Black Hinox Horn 
Predictable Patterns
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★    
Black Hinox Horns function in the exact same way as Boss Black Bokoblin Horns to give a weapon a &#43;27 damage buff. However, these enemies are far easier to find in six set locations around Hyrule in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. These enemies are similar in difficulty to the Bokoblins as well, but you have more time to prepare against them since you know where they spawn.





 6  Gleeok Horns 
All Hail the King


 







   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
The four different types of Gleeoks in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom have a chance to drop Horns as well as Guts when you defeat them. Fire Horns, Frost Horns, and Thunder Horns are all very effective Fuse materials in the game. This resource is more likely to drop against the more powerful King Gleeok, but the &#43;30 damage bonus from this item makes the struggle more than worth it. 





 5  Gibdo Bone 
Small Fractures
   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
You may think that Gibdo Bone is a much stronger Fuse material in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom due to its &#43;40 damage bonus applied to weapons. Unfortunately, this item breaks immediately after being used, despite the massive increase in offensive power. Those looking to take down most enemies in a single hit will still find this resource reliable, but you will have to collect this material a lot.





 4  Silver Bokoblin Horn 
Rare Rival
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
Silver Bokoblins are an extremely rare type of enemy you can track down in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for their valuable Horns. This item provides a &#43;31 damage bonus to weapons, and is by far the best Bokoblin-based Fuse material available. These creatures are no stranger to combat though, so you&#39;ll need to be ready for an intense fight to claim this resource as a reward.

 3  Silver Moblin Horn 
Hidden Hostilities
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★    
Similar to the Silver Mokoblin, the Silver variant of the Moblin has a chance to drop their Horn in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for an excellent Fuse material. This item gives a &#43;33 damage bonus to put it on the same pedestal as the previous resource. These enemies are tricky opponents, and have the ability to knock out Link in a single hit if you aren&#39;t careful.





 2  Silver Lynel Mace Horn 
Centaur Showdown
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★★    
While the Silver Lynel may be one of the hardest enemies to face in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, there&#39;s no denying that it drops an amazing Fuse material. The Mace Horn from this centaur can give a weapon &#43;51 damage to destroy nearly all of Link&#39;s foes. Only one other item in the entire game can match the strength of this resource.





 1  Silver Lynel Saber Horn 
Hi Ho Silver
        

   Attribute    Rating     Collection Difficulty    ★★     Fusion Potential    ★★★★★    
The Silver Lynel Saber Horn reflects the creature&#39;s destructive tendencies to decimate its enemies all across Hyrule. This item gives a weapon a &#43;55 damage bonus in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but only after victory from a hard battle. From this part, you can construct a weapon to rival all others from the best Fuse material in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
