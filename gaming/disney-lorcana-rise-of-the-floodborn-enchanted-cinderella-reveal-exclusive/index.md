## Literature Review

Screen Rant exclusively reveals a new Enchanted Storyborn Cinderella card coming to Disney Lorcanaâ€™s second set, Rise of the Floodborn.




Disney Lorcana is releasing its second set, titled Rise Of The Floodborn, later this week and Screen Rant can reveal the first official look at one of the set&#39;s new Enchanted cards: Cinderella. Releasing at local retailers on November 17 with a wider release on December 1, this second set will feature over 200 new Disney Lorcana cards via booster packs, starter decks, a new gift set, and a new Illumineer&#39;s Trove.




Thanks to Ravensburger, Screen Rant can exclusively reveal the Enchanted version of Rise Of The Floodborn&#39;s Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation card. Cinderella previously appeared with one card in Disney Lorcana&#39;s first set, The First Chapter, and has two further cards in Rise of the Floodborn alongside the base version of Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation: Cinderella - Stouthearted and Cinderella - Knight In Training.

          

                  Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards   Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is releasing soon, with new cards arriving via Illumineer&#39;s Troves, Gift Sets, and more in this second set.

Cinderella&#39;s Ballroom Sensation card for Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is a part of the Amber deck, and represents the princess as a Storyborn Hero, unlike the new Dreamborn &#34;Knight in Training&#34; and Floodborn &#34;Stouthearted&#34; cards. While the standard Ballroom Sensation card sees the iconic visual of Cinderella arriving at the ball in her pumpkin carriage, the Enchanted version shows Cinderella in the center of the image. The Enchanted card focuses on her flowing ballgown, which is surrounded by twinkling lights to really evoke the Fairy Godmother&#39;s magic at work at this moment.

Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation only has an attack power of one and a defense of two, and while questing, she only gains one lore. However, it is still a very useful card to have, as it only costs one ink to play, or can be turned into ink, and can count as a cost of three to sing a song.



Having this Cinderella card in play can also allow for a cheaper placement of Cinderella&#39;s more powerful Floodborn card: Cinderella - Stouthearted. This can be found in Rise of the Floodborn&#39;s Steel deck.







While the base version of Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation is a Rare card, the Enchanted version will be even harder to come by. Based on some of the pricing for similar Enchanted cards in Disney Lorcana&#39;s The First Chapter sets, this version could be valued anywhere between $100 and $600. This high value is partially due to stock issues thanks to Disney Lorcana&#39;s demand at launch, and it&#39;s yet to be seen if Rise of the Floodborn will also face stock shortages - and how this might impact the value of these new Enchanted cards.
