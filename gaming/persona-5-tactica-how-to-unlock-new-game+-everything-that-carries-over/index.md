## Literature Review

Persona 5 Tactica does have a New Game&#43; available for its players, but it goes by another name and players will be surprised to see what carries over.





Following the credits, the New Game&#43; option will appear and will load up a fresh start with certain stats carrying over. You should know that the content will remain the same as the original playthrough of Persona 5 Tactica. It&#39;s recommended you increase the difficulty level, especially since you will begin with better skills and stats, as this is the best way to create a slightly new experience that won&#39;t feel repetitive.




                  All Persona 5 Tactica Playable Characters, Ranked   There are eight playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Hereâ€™s how they compare to each other.   


 Everything That Carries Over To New Game&#43; In Persona 5 Tactica 
         

After completing the campaign, which is estimated to take around 20 hours, players will be prompted with a notice stating they have unlocked Cleared Data that can be saved. Loading this will bring players back to the beginning of Persona 5 Tactica, but this time, they will begin the story with all of their final stats from the first playthrough and something special in the Report. Note that this works as a save file, so don&#39;t override any other save data you would like to keep.

As for what exactly carries over into New Game&#43;, you can expect a majority of what was also transferable into New Game&#43; in Persona 5 Royal, including:




  Personas &amp; Persona Fusions   Weapons &amp; Weapon Fusions   Skill Tree Unlocks   Money   GP  



If you have also completed the Paint Your Heart DLC, Kasumi Yoshizawa (Violet) and Goro Akechi (Crow) will also be playable in New Game&#43;. However, they will not affect the main story or have any unique dialogue.




The only thing that will not carry over is any story-related content. Certain characters will still need to be re-unlocked, and all side missions must be unlocked. Though nothing changes in the game while completing New Game&#43;, players will have the chance to grind for more GP and enjoy exclusive art, including concept art for Persona 5 Tactica, which includes original character design concepts and more.
