## Literature Review

Special Fusion Personas in Persona 5 Tactica are some of the most powerful in the game, but they require specific recipes in order to be crafted.





Those who have taken the time to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal will have a slight advantage here, as the method for creating Special Fusions and the results are essentially the same in Persona 5 Tactica. For anyone unfamiliar with this mechanic, there&#39;s still no need to worry. Since the recipes are not randomized, they can always be referenced to create Special Fusions.

 Every Special Fusion Recipe In Persona 5 Tactica 
         

There are 19 Special Fusion Recipes, but only 18 are available through the traditional means. Though this is less than some other entries in the franchise, they are more than capable of helping Joker and other characters in Persona 5 Tactica to accomplish their goals. While there are fusions in the game where several different things can produce the same result, Special Fusions are very specific. A Special Fusion means that no other combination will create this result, and the same recipe must be used every time to create that designated Persona Fusion in Persona 5 Tactica.



The Satanael Special Fusion must be unlocked before it can be created. To unlock Satanael, complete all 15 side quests, in addition to meeting the other typical requirements.
