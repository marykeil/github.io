## Literature Review

The most chaotic hat in Goat Simulator 3 will take some effort to earn, but it is well worth it for the sheer amount of chaos caused afterward.





Cosmetics are a big deal for goats, proven by the fact that you can get a Goat Simulator 3 skin in Fortnite. There is a wide range of hats, clothes, shoes, and even other types of goats to unlock throughout the game, all of which come with their superpower. This includes the Golden Poop Hat, which can only be found by completing a monumental task.




                  Funniest Goat Simulator 3 Easter Eggs   Goat Simulator 3 is full of secret Easter eggs that play into the game&#39;s wacky nature. Here are some of most hilarious ones that you can find.   


 How To Unlock The Golden Poop Hat In Goat Simulator 3 
          

Currently, the only way to get the Golden Poop Hat will take the most chaotic of goats to achieve. Your goat will have to traverse the whole map and find all 200 trinkets scattered throughout the game. Each map region has a list of how many trinkets are available there, and players will have to clear all of them to earn the Golden Poop Hat. However, friends can also join the game and find trinkets together in Goat Simulator 3’s multiplayer, as trophies and achievements carry over into everyone’s solo playthrough.






Finding these trinkets will be easier if you have unlocked some movement-based cosmetic upgrades, such as the Daredevil Helmet.




To find any trinkets you’re still missing, the YouTube Channel Backseat Guides has a full breakdown of where to find every trinket to earn the Try Hard 2 Trophy.​​


 

Finding all Trinkets will also unlock the hat, completing the Golden Garb set, including Golden Fur, Horns, and Shoes. After unlocking it, players can equip it to find that it delivers on the promise in the name. Players will be able to poop endlessly as they traverse through the world, causing pedestrians to crinkle their noses, wave their hands, and look at the Golden Goat in disgust. This can be even more chaotic if players choose to headbutt the poop dispensed at random pedestrians.




Once this truly chaotic achievement has been unlocked, players can host a party in Goat Simulator 3 and terrorize the locals together. It will make a memorable night out for you and your friends, and it is well worth the effort to find. In a game made for causing chaos, the Golden Poop Hat is the best way to ramp that chaos up as quickly as possible.
