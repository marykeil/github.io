## Literature Review

The Gigantopithecus has some strong general utility in Ark: Survival Ascended, but one specific advantage gives it a special edge over any alternative




Ark: Survival Ascended has no shortage of creatures to tame, and it&#39;s easy to be drawn to the exciting options like iconic dinosaurs and winged beasts. The best options aren&#39;t always the showiest, however, and digging deep into the choices that can be made reveals one animal with exceptionally effective usage. The Gigantopithecus might not be everyone&#39;s first choice to tame in Ark: Survival Ascended, but its extraordinary utility makes ignoring the opportunity a potentially terrible mistake.




Like many creatures in Ark: Survival Ascended, Gigantopithecus comes from real prehistory. As an extinct genus of ape that lived during the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gigantopithecus gets its name from its massive size that fossil records indicate. While the tallest living primates are generally somewhere around six feet tall, this behemoth was closer to ten, towering over any apes that could be found today. Considering the extraordinary strength of many primates, the idea of coming face to face with a Gigantopithecus is uniquely intimidating, and Ark: Survival Ascended doesn&#39;t hold back on its power.

 ASA&#39;s Gigantopithecus Makes Moving Heavy Loads Easy 
          




The most distinct mechanic of a Gigantopithecus in Ark: Survival Ascended is the ability to toss humans, which can be a quick and easy way to gain a bit of elevation or make it over an obstacle in the environment.

The particularly neat Ark: Survival Ascended hidden feature comes from the fact that the Gigantopithecus doesn&#39;t seem to mind heavy loads, so it&#39;s possible to fill up a player character&#39;s inventory with cumbersome materials and use the Gigantopithecus to move quickly to a target destination. One user on Reddit even shows this technique off in a short clip in which they transport an inventory full of metal in a matter of seconds.

Avoiding encumbrance penalties might be the most exciting application of a tamed Gigantopithecus in Ark: Survival Ascended, but it isn&#39;t the only way that the primate can be put to good use. Its oversized humanoid shape gives it some advantages like the ability to use ziplines and equip any type of helmet, and the latter possibility stacks with generally high HP to make it an excellent tank. The Gigantopithecus can gather both actively and passively, and it&#39;s a good choice for exploration with the ability to easily climb steep slopes and navigate caves.



Although it&#39;s not necessary to be anywhere near max character level in Ark: Survival Ascended to tame a Gigantopithecus, the minimum required is level 30.




Ultimately, the Gigantopithecus is only one among a number of excellent mounts in Ark: Survival Ascended, but it&#39;s hard to argue against a beast that can make moving resources so much quicker and easier. Heading into the Redwood Forests to seek one out is a great move once a player is properly prepared, and it&#39;s likely to pay dividends in the long run. The Gigantopethicus isn&#39;t difficult to tame, so there&#39;s no reason not to take advantage of one of the best prehistoric creatures that Ark: Survival Ascended has to offer.
