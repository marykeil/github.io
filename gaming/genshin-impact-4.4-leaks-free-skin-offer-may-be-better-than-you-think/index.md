## Literature Review

Genshin Impact players may finally be getting some generous treatment in Version 4.4 with the arrival of a surprising though limited tool.




There are rumors and leaks about Genshin Impact 4.4 that indicate players may be getting a limited free skin offer, and it may be even better than anticipated. Currently, HoYoverse’s popular RPG is in Version 4.3, but the upcoming patch is being submitted to tests and, with the data there, a lot of the future content has already been leaked. Cloud Retainer’s release date in Genshin Impact was first leaked, and then basically confirmed by the developer nearly a month later. Some of the leaks also address a quality-of-life update for players who like to prepare several team comps for the various situations across Teyvat.




There are even leaks that mention the introduction of new areas to a fan-favorite region in the game, as well as a new deity that inhabits that very land. The patch is also expected to add new skins in Genshin Impact 4.4 for two very popular 5-star Cryo characters. Overall, it seems like there is much to look out for in the upcoming patch, but one more secretive and less-discussed leak indicates that players will actually be getting a unique opportunity: a limited chance to put their hands on a premium piece of content without actually having to pay for any Genesis Crystals.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   


 Genshin Impact 4.4 May Offer All 4-Star Skins For Free 
          




According to a leak overview by user Genshin_Intel on X, Version 4.4 is expected to have a 4-star skin selector. In a response to another user who asked what “skin selector” meant, Genshin_Intel cites that players will be able to select one of all the 4-star skins currently available in Genshin Impact, including the two new ones that are bound to make their way with the upcoming patch. Although the post and user profile have been deleted, this information was also shared by Genshinverse2 on X, where they showcased a screenshot of the said 4-star skin selector. The alleged picture includes icons for F2P (free-to-play) and premium skins alike.



F2P skins are commonly given out for free for a short period. These skins are those of 4-star characters, such as Lisa and Kaeya. After the promotional period ends, F2P skins are added to the store and become premium acquisitions for those who did not obtain them originally. Premium skins are released as paid optional content and are usually related to 5-star characters, like Keqing and Ayaka.






 Which 4-Star Skins Are There In Genshin Impact (&amp; Which Are New) 
         




At the moment, the action RPG has nine 4-star skins. Jean’s Sea Breeze Dandelion was one of the first outfits in the game, and the first premium one to be added to the shop. It showcases Jean in a beach-themed bathing suit and was released back in Version 1.6, during the Midsummer Island Adventure flagship event. During that same period, players were also able to acquire Barbara’s F2P outfit, called Summertime Sparkle. With it, Barbara dons a beach-themed swimsuit and elements that resemble a sailor, like a uniform and a hat. This item is now a premium product in Genshin Impact’s in-game shop.

The next outfit to be released was Keqing’s skin called Opulent Splendor. This item puts Keqing in an elegant black and blue dress. It was released as a premium item in Version 2.4, during 2022’s Lantern Rite Festival event. At that same time, HoYoverse offered a F2P skin: the Orchid’s Evening Gown for Ningguang. This special character outfit puts the Geo unit in an elegant dark blue dress. After the end of its promotional period in the Fleeting Colors in Flight event celebrating that year’s Lantern Rite in Genshin Impact, Orchid’s Evening Gown was also added to the in-game shop as a paid product.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: The Best Region Is Getting Even Bigger   It seems like the best region in Genshin Impact may be getting an extension in Version 4.4. Here is what this could mean for the story.   

Following the release of the skins for the Liyue characters, HoYoverse’s next skins were added in Version 2.8. The only 4-star one is the Ein Immernachtstraum for Fischl. This item puts Fischl in a white and purple dress rather than her darker clothing. It was offered as a free prize for the Resonating Visions event. The other skin to be added was Diluc’s Red Dead of Night, but that is a 5-star item that not only alters the clothing he wears but also some of his audio and skill effects. So far, this is the only 5-star skin in Genshin Impact.



Diluc’s outfit is not expected to be a part of the allegedly leaked skin selector in Genshin Impact 4.4 as it is not a 4-star skin.







In Version 3.4, the game received two new 4-star skins. Springbloom Missive is a Fontaine-inspired country dress for Ayaka. It is the clothing she wears when traveling and boasts leather boots, a straw hat, and a light blue and white dress. As a 5-star character, this 4-star skin was immediately added as a premium acquisition. During the same update and as part of the Second Blooming event, players could also grab Lisa’s F2P skin, A Sobriquet Under Shade. This outfit puts Lisa in a green dress that is made to resemble her uniform from when she attended school at the Akademiya in Genshin Impact’s Sumeru region.

The most recent skins in the game arrived with Version 3.8, before the introduction of the Fontaine region. Blossoming Starlight is Klee’s premium 4-star skin. It puts the Pyro character in a cut red witch’s dress, with a large hat that resembles that of a wizard. The other one is Kaeya’s Sailwind Shadow, which takes on a pirate-themed design. Like Klee’s skin, it was shown during the Secret Summer Paradise event. Players could grab it for free during the Genshin Impact event and those who missed it now have to pay for it.




If the leaks are to be believed, the total number of 4-star outfits should increase to 12 with the arrival of three new skins for three distinct characters: Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xingqiu. According to information provided by the leaker known as Foul, later shared in a now-deleted post on Reddit by user ___somebody_, Ganyu and Shenhe’s outfits are going to be quite elegant in their design, with dresses that may resemble those of Guizhong and Streetward Rambler, respectively. As 5-star units, these skins are expected to be premium. Xingqiu’s rumored skin in Genshin Impact, on the other hand, will likely be free for a limited time.

                  Genshin Impact Leaks: Xiao&#39;s Rerun Is Perfect For One New Character   It seems like Xiao is getting a rerun in Genshin Impact. That may actually be great news, as he allegedly pairs up well with a new character.   

Though the addition of a limited 4-star skin selector has yet to be officially confirmed, this would be great news for players. Not only would they get a chance to grab one of the F2P skins they may have missed from previous events, but they may actually be able to acquire a premium product for free. It is not common for HoYoverse to give out generous handouts, so the prospect of getting a premium paid item completely for free may be a huge improvement from what the developer has been offering Genshin Impact players so far.
