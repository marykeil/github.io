## Literature Review

                  8 Tips for Beginners in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora   The beautiful open-world presented in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora can be intimidating for beginners. Here&#39;s a few tips to help start your journey.   



 Every Silk Woods Tarsyu Sapling Location 
          

As you improve your Combat Strength in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, dealing with enemies found near Tarsyu Saplings should become easier. Once again, the Silk Woods area has four plants to discover in the Kinglor Forest. At this point, you should have enough Skill Points to acquire abilities that will help your character traverse these zones without much trouble.

Tarsyu Sapling #6   Along The Threaded River, within a cave found right before it joins up with another stream from Blackwater Basin.                           Tarsyu Sapling #7   North of the Cocoon Hills, past The Threaded River, deep into the forest in the trunk of a large tree with orange fungi.                           Tarsyu Sapling #8   West of Hunter&#39;s Headland, in a valley canyon next to two large stone arches under floating islands. You can swing across a vine toward a cave where the Sapling can be found in the canyon.                          








 Every Rising Spire Tarsyu Sapling Location 
          

Similar to Spinner&#39;s Circle, only one plant is found in the Rising Spire section of your map in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. You might spot this wildlife as you soar between the huge rock pillars on your Ikran. Look for pink petals on different fauna and the abundance of blue butterfly-looking animals marking the presence of a Sapling close by.

 Every Shadow Wood Tarsyu Sapling Location 
          

The vast Kinglor Forest holds another two Saplings in the Shadow Wood area, but this time in places exclusive to Ikran Mounts. You won&#39;t be able to obtain the Skill Points from these plants until your progression through the main story lets you get your flying mount. If you have been exploring nonstop, return to quests you may have left until you can reach that point in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

 Every Gossamer Lakes Tarsyu Sapling Location 
          

Four Saplings are scattered around the Gossamer Lakes area of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, but these can be found in quite obvious spots. This region&#39;s vast body of water leaves little room for the plants to hide, letting you see them from afar. Riding a land mount like a Direhorse may not work here, but your Ikran should be able to show you where Saplings are pretty quickly.

Tarsyu Sapling #13   Right before the large stone archway south of Mentor&#39;s River that leads into Tangled Lake. The RDA Outpost Probe Site Charlie is almost right on top of the Sapling, which is found in a small alcove protected by vines.                           Tarsyu Sapling #14   At the very peak of the stone archway right above Tangled Lake. You can only reach this spot with an Ikran mount.                           Tarsyu Sapling #15   To the east of the Woodsprite Arches, nestled in a series of jagged sections of the large stone arch described above Tangled Lake.                          








 Every Stoneblade Ridge Tarsyu Sapling Location 
          

The final section of Kinglor Forest, known to host two more Tarsyu Saplings, is Stoneblade Ridge, far north of these dense woods. These plants are difficult to obtain peacefully, as some are placed in the middle of multiple RDA Outposts. Take your time to attack these facilities first to liberate the area and make exploration here less stressful in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.​​​​​​​

Tarsyu Sapling #17   On an island in Ovation Falls, below the massive waterfall where the Bough River starts to begin.                          



Once you find every Tarsyu Sapling&#39;s location in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, your character can unlock new abilities that will let you tackle tougher quests throughout your adventure.
