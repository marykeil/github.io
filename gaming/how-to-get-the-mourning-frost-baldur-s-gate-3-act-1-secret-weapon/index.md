## Literature Review

Mourning Frost is one of the best quarterstaffs in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3. Here’s how you can unlock the three pieces needed to craft it.





Among the scarcity of remarkable gear in Act 1, especially for mages, as they do not usually benefit from the items provided by the Adamantine Forge in Baldur’s Gate 3, Mourning Frost is a great item to add to your inventory. This quarterstaff can be crafted with three pieces and given to characters such as Gale or even your own custom Wizard or Warlock. It does not compete with some of the better mage weapons provided in the later stages, but it is a fantastic option to keep around for a large portion of the RPG by Larian Studios.




                  7 Best Solo Class Builds For Baldur’s Gate 3   Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 provides a team of companions, some prefer to take on the game solo. These builds will help with that massive task.

Icy Crystal, Icy Metal, &amp; Icy Helve Locations
         

To unlock the Mourning Frost quarterstaff, you will first need to collect three distinct items. They are the Icy Crystal, the Icy Metal, and the Icy Helve. All of them are concentrated in the Underdark map in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3, but despite being gathered there, you will have to do some exploring and some fighting to obtain all three pieces. The first of them is the Icy Crystal, and it is the most easily obtained. To get it, you need to leave the Myconid Colony through the western exit and head down the path with a waterfall.




The table below lists how to obtain each item necessary to craft the Mourning Frost quarterstaff and a set of approximated coordinates to help locate them:

  Item Name   How To Obtain   Approximate Coordinates    Icy Crystal   Go to the Dread Hollow in the Underdark. Fight the Hook Horrors and defeat the drow known as Filro the Forgotten. Loot his body and claim the Icy Crystal.   Filro the Forgotten (X: -50, Y: -148)    Icy Metal   Help Sovereign Spaw in the Myconid Colony by defeating the Duergar invaders in the Underdark - Beach area. Return to Spaw, and they will open a locked chamber near the western exit of the Colony. Loot the Pale Corpse for the Icy Metal.   Pale Corpse: (X: 52, Y: -73)    Icy Helve   Find and defeat Dhourn to the west of the Selûnite Outpost in the Underdark. Loot his corpse to obtain the Icy Helve.   Dhourn (X:112, Y: -246)   



As you progress, you will eventually reach the Dread Hollow portion of the Underdark. There, you will be greeted by an enemy called a Hook Horror. You will need to beat it and explore a little until you find a way up the massive tree branches. Atop these tree branches, you will battle some more enemies. Your ultimate target, however, is a mage called Filro the Forgotten. He fights at a distance with spells and will become hostile upon seeing you. After you have defeated him, you can loot his body and obtain the Icy Crystal.






You can also obtain the Sussur Tree Bark atop these tree branches, which is used to craft Sussur weapons.




The Icy Metal is the next piece needed to craft the Mourning Frost quarterstaff. To obtain it, you will have to get past the locked entrance to the vault room inside the Myconid Colony. This side quest can be initiated by interacting with Sovereign Spawn in Baldur’s Gate 3. The creature will ask you to eliminate Duergar intruders who have been killing the Myconids. The group Spaw is referring to is located southwest, in the Underdark - Beach area. Once they have been eliminated, return to Spaw, and the Myconid Sovereign will unlock the door you need access to.

The secret door is located near the western exit of the Myconid Colony. For further reference, it is very close to where the vendor, Derryth Bonecloak, and her husband, Baelen, usually stay in Baldur’s Gate 3 (if previously found and successfully rescued). Head inside and loot the Pale Corpse you find. You will obtain the Icy Metal needed to craft the Mourning Frost quarterstaff by doing so. It is important to note that there are several other useful items to loot from the unlocked room and the Pale Corpse itself, so do not limit yourself only to the Icy Metal.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: How To Solve The Necrotic Laboratory Puzzle   A projected mind in the Necrotic Laboratory area of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 creates a fragmented puzzle that you must solve to open a path leading forward.   

The final piece is the Icy Helve, obtained further from the Myconid Colony. To get it, you must backtrack southeast toward the Underdark - Selûnite Outpost teleport waypoint. Instead of moving out from the fortification’s regular northern exit, you must exit through a broken window on the western wall. By following the path downward and toward the zone with purple crystals, you will initiate a mini-boss battle against a Spectator and his minions in Baldur’s Gate 3. Icy Helve can then be looted from the corpse of a drow named Dhourn.

Once you have obtained all three Icy pieces, you can consider forging the Mourning Frost. To do this:

  Open your inventory and click on any of the three items you obtained.   Select the Combine option. This will prompt a sub-menu pop-up, where you can drag the other two Icy pieces from your inventory into empty slots.   Once you add all items, press the Combine button.   Mourning Frost will be crafted and automatically added to your inventory.  




Mourning Frost is not the best quarterstaff in the game, but one of the strongest ones to have so early on in the campaign. The weapon deals 1d8 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage &#43;1d4 Cold damage. Its effects are called Heart of Ice and Insidious Cold. With Heart of Ice, the user deals an extra &#43;1 Cold damage when dealing Cold damage. With Insidious Cold, you can inflict Chilled on a target when dealing Cold damage with a spell. Mourning Frost also has Weapon Enchantment &#43;1 and unlocks the Topple and Ray of Frost abilities in Baldur’s Gate 3.
