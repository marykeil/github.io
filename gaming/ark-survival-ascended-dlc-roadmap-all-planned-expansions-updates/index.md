# Ark Survival Ascended DLC Roadmap - All Planned Expansions &amp; Updates


## SUMMARY 



  Ark: Survival Ascended is a remaster of Ark: Survival Evolved, but launched without any of the original&#39;s DLC expansions.   A roadmap has revealed that all of ASE&#39;s DLC will come to ASA over the course of roughly two years.   All DLC is included at no additional charge with the purchase of Ark: Survival Ascended.

## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended is a remastered Survival Evolved in Unreal Engine 5, and is expected to gradually include all of the original’s DLC expansions.




Ark: Survival Ascended is a remaster of 2015&#39;s Ark: Survival Evolved, but the newer version does not contain all the content released over the lifetime of the original. Enjoying regular support since its release, Survival Evolved received both paid and free expansions after its release. Though Survival Ascended includes a number of quality-of-life improvements in addition to is superior visuals, it is notably light on content compared to the original. This will, however, be rectified over the next two years, according to a roadmap laid out for the game&#39;s DLC.




From 2016 to 2022, the original Ark: Survival Evolved received 12 official DLCs – five Expansion Packs, six Expansion Maps, and a Total Conversion. Expansion Packs brought the most content, including new maps, creatures, and items. Expansion Maps were generally much smaller additions, giving players a new locale to explore, but not always introducing unique creatures or items. The one official Total Conversion, known as Primitive&#43;, overhauled primitive servers, and has so far not been confirmed to be returning in Suvival Ascended. The 11 other DLCs, however, do appear on Ark: Survival Ascended&#39;s DLC roadmap.

                  Ark: Survival Ascended - Release Date, Differences, &amp; Graphics Comparison   Ark: Survival Ascended lands somewhere between a remake, remaster, and reimagining of the original Ark. Here’s what to expect, and when to expect it.   


 Ark: Survival Ascended DLC Scheduled for Release In 2023 
Cryopods, Survival Of The Fittest
          




The first major content additions to Ark: Survival Ascended, according to a roadmap posted in the game&#39;s Discord server (and subsequently put on Reddit by user FarmerFran_X), aren&#39;t actually any of Survival Evolved&#39;s DLCs, but rather a major mechanic that wasn&#39;t ready for ASA&#39;s launch, and a battle royale game mode. Both set for December 2023 are Cryopods and Survival of the Fittest. Cryopods let players put dinos on ice, effectively turning them into an item that can be carried in one&#39;s inventory – an invaluable item when trying to relocate herds of creatures.

Survival of the Fittest was a battle royale spin-off of ASE, which never reached any platform other than Steam. Taking place on special servers, the objective in SOTF is to be the last player (or tribe, in the case of team matches) standing, having eliminated all other competitors. It originally came fairly early in ASE&#39;s life cycle, releasing while it was still in early access on PC, though development support for the game mode ended shortly after. The remaster&#39;s version of SOTF will similarly be one of the first additions to the game, and appears to be coming to Ark: Survival Ascended&#39;s console versions as well.

 Ark: Survival Ascended DLC Scheduled For Release In 2024 
Scorched Earth, The Center, Aberration, Ragnarok, Extinction, Valguero
          

It won&#39;t be until 2024 that Ark: Survival Ascended receives proper DLC expansions. First, set for May 2024, is Scorched Earth. Introducing a desert map, a far cry from the original tropical island map, Scorched Earth makes collecting drinking water much more difficult, and introduces new weather patterns like sandstorms, superheat, and electrical storms. Scorched Earth also brings a large variety of desert-themed creatures and items. Scorched Earth will then be followed two months later by The Center in May 2024. The Center began as a custom map before being added to ASE in a free, official update. Much like The Island (the original map), The Center features a handful of different biomes on islands surrounded by the ocean.




Aberration is expected to release in July 2024 for Ark: Survival Ascended, being its second major DLC expansion. Aberration&#39;s new map forces players underground due to intense radiation on the ARK&#39;s surface. It therefore features new biomes, creatures, items, and environmental hazards typically associated with subterranean locales, like a mushroom forest, gems, and frequent earthquakes. Aberration will be followed by another Expansion Map, Ragnarok, in September 2024. With a Norse theme, Ragnarok adds a number of wintry creatures, and features an active volcano, which causes lava flows and falling rock upon eruption.

                  Does Ark: Survival Ascended Support Cross-Platform Play?   Ark: Survival Ascended touted complete crossplay between PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but it has also disabled it several times in the past.    

ASA&#39;s third Expansion Pack, Extinction, is scheduled for release in October 2024. Extinction deviates from previous Ark DLCs in that it&#39;s set on a planet, rather than the series&#39; signature ARK space station environments. Extinction does, however, still take some cues from Aberration, with the maps surface rather hostile, a wasteland surrounding a crumbling city seemingly built by an advanced species. Unique, corrupted creatures are the biggest threat to players hoping to survive on Extinction. Following, in December 2024, is Valguero, another Expansion Map with a wide variety of biomes, including glacial plateaus and a subaqueous cave network known as The Abyss.




The final – and perhaps most exciting – update of 2024, according to the DLC roadmap, is &#34;some surprise&#34; expected to come in November. There&#39;s no indication of what the surprise DLC for Ark: Survival Ascended could be, but it may be something entirely new that&#39;s not yet ready to be revealed, considering every other planned expansion is a known quantity from ASE. Although it would be a strange inclusion on a roadmap for ASA&#39;s DLC, it&#39;s conceivable that this surprise could be connected to Ark 2, which has yet to receive a release date.

                  Ark: Survival Ascended’s Release Date Is Great News For Ark 2   Ark 2 has had a rough history of delays, but things may finally be looking up thanks to the concrete leap made by Ark: Survival Ascended.   



 Ark: Survival Ascended DLC Scheduled For Release In 2025 
Genesis Parts 1 &amp; 2, Crystal Isles, Lost Island, Fjordur
          

Much like 2024, Ark: Survival Ascended DLC is planned for regular releases throughout 2025, with the final two Expansion Packs and three Expansion Maps making their return. Both Expansion Packs, Genesis: Part 1 and Part 2, are rather distinct from previous ones. Part 1, scheduled for February 2025, essentially offers five maps in one, separating its biomes into smaller-than-usual maps that players must teleport between. Part 2, expected to arrive in May 2025, takes place aboard a colony ship with two distinct sections, one lush and the other corrupted. Players are able to travel between the two regions while the ship travels through space.




The final three Expansion Maps for Ark: Survival Ascended are Crystal Isles, Lost Island, and Fjordur, set to be released in April 2025, August 2025, and October 2025 respectively. Crystal Isles is likely the largest map by surface area (rivaled in size only by Ragnarok), and is covered by large crystal formations across its many biomes. Lost Island is littered with the ruins of some civilization, both on land and in the sea, and its primary landmass bears a striking resemblance to the map of Tamriel from The Elder Scrolls. Fjordur is another Norse-inspired map, with realms named after Jotunheim, Vanaheim, and Asgard.

                  10 Biggest Differences Between Ark: Survival Ascended &amp; Survival Evolved   Ark: Survival Ascended is a graphical revamp of Survival Evolved using UE5, but questions of what else has changed are worth exploring.    



 Ark Survival Ascended DLC Release Schedule &amp; Price 
All DLC Included At No Additional Cost
         

All together, Ark: Survival Ascended is set to have nearly two whole years of regular DLC releases. While it&#39;s helpful to know the plans of the developer, Studio Wildcard, players likely shouldn&#39;t put an incredible amount of stock in this DLC roadmap. While remastering ASE&#39;s expansion content is conceivably much easier than creating brand-new content, laying out expansions with usually only two or three months between each is rather ambitious. At a glance, late 2024, with Ragnarok, Extinction, the unrevealed surprise, and Valguero all coming in the span of four months, the roadmap seems ripe for delays.




However, all the DLC seems to be included with the purchase of Ark: Survival Ascended. According to the game&#39;s Steam page, &#34;Ark: Survival Ascended includes access to all of Ark&#39;s worlds,&#34; with &#34;expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost.&#34; ASA was originally announced as a free upgrade, since it is more-or-less an engine transfer to Unreal Engine 5 (with some added quality-of-life improvements), but this was walked back, and the game now costs $45 on Steam. The DLCs previously ranged from $20 to $35, so this should at least be some consolation to those miffed by Ark: Survival Ascended turning out to be a paid upgrade.
