## Literature Review

A recent release date leak seemingly confirms when Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will be released on Xbox - but news directly from Larian suggests otherwise.




While Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has released to massive success on PC and Playstation platforms, the game still yet to make its way to Xbox - and, despite a leak pointing towards a set, confirmed date for the port&#39;s release, word from developer Larian Studios has quickly debunked the leak. First fully released on PC on August 3 after a lengthy early access period spanning multiple years, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 would later go on to receive its PS5 port just over a month later, on September 6, leaving the Xbox as the game&#39;s final major platform still awaiting a port, over two months later.




While fans of the game and those looking forward to playing it may have thought that BG3 had console exclusivity to Playstation, the game is set to come out on Xbox as well. Despite the lack of platform exclusivity, however, the wait for an Xbox version of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has been considerably longer than the month-long delay that ended up occurring for the PS5 port, and a set release date has yet to be officially announced. Although a recent leak pointed towards a set release date near the end of 2023, Larian Studios has refuted the claim.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3 Console Release: When BG3 Is Coming To PS5 &amp; Xbox   Baldur’s Gate 3 is now available for PC players to experience. Here is when the new turn-based RPG is arriving for PS5 and Xbox consoles.    


 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Leaked Xbox Release Date Is False 
Platforms &amp; Release Dates: PC (August 3, 2023), PS5 (September 6, 2023), Xbox (TBA, Expected 2023)
         




A recent leak points to December 6 as the set release date for the Xbox version of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but was quickly de-confirmed by Michael Douse, the Director of Publishing at Larian, on his Twitter @Cromwelp. Although there&#39;s still no set release date, Douse went on to say that the port was still planned for release &#34;before the end of the year&#34; and that Larian is focused on delivering &#34;a really good version that Xbox fans deserve.&#34; Especially with regard to features, performance, and bugs, creating a functioning port for both versions of the Xbox - Series X or S - has posed a significant challenge for the studio.


 



 Why Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Has Taken So Long To Come To Xbox 
Xbox Series S Is Holding BG3 Back
          




Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 already has a PS5 release which addresses many of the potential problems that a port of heavily mouse-and-keyboard oriented game like BG3 might have on consoles, the current Xbox generation has presented another, particularly difficult-to-solve problem - the difference in power between the two versions. The Series S is notably less powerful than the Series X, but also makes up a majority of the Xbox&#39;s sales for the current generation, which created a significant problem for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in particular.

BG3 is already, at default, a heavy game to run on many systems, and although performance has been improved through updates, mid-range PCs and consoles can still struggle to run it. One of the major problems posed by the Series X|S, then was the feature parity clause, dictating that games released for the platform were required to maintain the same features for each version of the console - creating a major issue for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s split-screen co-op mode, which the Xbox Series S would inevitably have technical issues trying to run.




                  10 Improvements Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Needs On PS5 &amp; Xbox   Baldur’s Gate 3 just seems to make more sense on PC, but it’s coming to consoles anyway. A few fixes can make the PS5 and Xbox versions much better.    

Luckily for Xbox fans who want to play Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, however, the feature parity clause for Xbox has been dropped, as announced by Larian CEO Swen Vincke on his Twitter @LarAtLarian, allowing for the Xbox port of the game to drop the split-screen feature for its release on the Series S. For those who&#39;d prefer to play the game in split-screen, the feature will still be maintained for the more powerful Series X, and both versions will feature cross-save with both each other and the Steam version of the game. So, although the exact release date of the Xbox port is still to be announced, it can likely still be expected towards the end of 2023.

While the wait for an Xbox version of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has been particularly long, the version of the game that eventually releases on the platform will (hopefully) be more polished at release than the PC or PS5 versions, having the benefit of several updates&#39; worth of bug fixes, quality-of-life additions, and performance improvements. According to promises made by staff at Larian, the final, complete version of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to be released on Xbox Series X|S should be well worth the wait.
