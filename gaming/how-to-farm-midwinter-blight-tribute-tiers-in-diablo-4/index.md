## Literature Review

The Midwinter Blight seasonal event for Diablo 4 offers a ton of new gear and rewards, especially for any character that farms various Tribute Tiers.





There are three Tribute Tiers your character can achieve throughout The Midwinter Blight. Reaching these &#34;ranks&#34; will give you two prizes for every level and a special Midwinter Ward reward for those who make it to Tier 3. Characters on World Tier 3 in Diablo 4 or above may have a harder time advancing through Tiers due to the higher difficulty.

 How To Reach Higher Tribute Tiers Fast in Diablo 4 
          

The three ways to best reach higher Tribute Tiers in Diablo 4&#39;s Midwinter Blight event is to find Lost Heirlooms, Blighted Fragments, or Red Cloaked Trophy items. These resources are found in event areas marked on your map throughout Sanctuary as the limited-time season continues. Most of the time, you&#39;ll have to kill waves of enemies or break structures found in the world to collect each material.



Event areas for The Midwinter Blight are similar to Helltides in Diablo 4. You can open your map to see an orange triangle icon somewhere in Sanctuary to see where the next event is taking place, then fast travel through a Waypoint to reach it quickly.







Any items mentioned can be exchanged for Midwinter Proofs or the main currency for the seasonal event. Blighted Fragments are dropped by Blightfiend enemies in an event area that usually stands near Frigid Husks. Breaking a Husk will cause it to drop Lost Heirlooms, but Red-Cloaked Trophies are only given by the Red-Cloaked Horror boss in Diablo 4 found in Blighted Revelry events.

Your Tribute Tiers increase as you hand over more and more of the event loot until they eventually make it to a new level. Keep gaining Proofs to raise your Tiers quickly in Diablo 4, then spend your currency on exclusive event items with the NPC Gileon in Kyovashad.

Learning how to farm Tribute Tiers in Diablo 4 will also let you gain new cosmetics, titles, and even a Legendary Aspect for your character.
