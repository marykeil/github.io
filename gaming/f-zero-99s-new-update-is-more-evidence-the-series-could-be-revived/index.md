# F-Zero 99s New Update Is More Evidence The Series Could Be Revived


## SUMMARY 



  F-Zero 99 is heavily inspired by the original F-Zero from the Super Nintendo, but it&#39;s online mulitplayer gameplay is completely novel.   An update has added a Classic mode to F-Zero 99, which plays more similarly to the series&#39; original.   F-Zero 99 has been seen as a way to gauge interest in a new, full F-Zero game, and Classic mode only fuels this theory.

## Literature Review

A new mode has come to F-Zero 99, and it takes the multiplayer racing game closer to the series&#39; roots, giving longtime fans hope for a new game.




An update has introduced a new game mode to F-Zero 99, bringing the online multiplayer racing game even closer to the series&#39; roots. Although based on the series&#39; original, Super Nintendo release, F-Zero 99 is a far cry from the traditional, high-speed racing the F-Zero games are typically known for. The series had lain dormant for nearly two decades prior to 99 releasing for free on Nintendo Switch Online, and this latest game mode only serves to fuel suspicions that the multiplayer-only title is leading to an F-Zero revival.




F-Zero is the latest in a handful of games adapting select all-time classics into a battle royale format. Pac-Man 99, Super Mario Bros. 35, and Tetris 99 all preceded F-Zero 99 in turning retro games into competitive, free-to-play (NSO subscription aside), multiplayer games. While F-Zero 99&#39;s main game mode has the player competing against 98 others, trying to survive waves of eliminations to be the last remaining racer, a new game mode introduced via an update is far more reminiscent of the series&#39; original, non-battle royale slanted racing.

 F-Zero 99&#39;s New Classic Game Mode Is Just Multiplayer F-Zero 
          

A little over two months after the game launched, an update was pushed to F-Zero 99, which added a new game mode called Classic. According to Nintendo of America on Twitter, the &#34;20-pilot race&#34; utilizes &#34;rules inspired by the original F-Zero.&#34; This means it drops some of 99&#39;s gimmicks alongside the lower player count â€“ the Skyway, used to rapidly overtake competitors on a limited track above the normal one, and the spin attack have both been removed. For another hit of nostalgia, Classic mode utilizes the original F-Zero&#39;s 4:3 aspect ratio, placing borders on either side like the games in NSO&#39;s retro collection.






F-Zero 99&#39;s Classic mode uses the original game&#39;s boost mechanics, where one boost is awarded for each lap completed, giving players three total boosts in a four-lap race.






 F-Zero 99&#39;s Classic Mode Could Be Testing The Waters For A New F-Zero Game 
          

While Nintendo has never confirmed this as the game&#39;s intention, F-Zero 99 has been seen as a segue into potentially reviving the long-dormant racing series, and the Classic mode&#39;s introduction post-launch feels like more evidence to support this theory. While Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros., and Tetris are fairly obvious candidates for a free-to-play spin-off, F-Zero is arguably much more niche. Still, longtime fans are hoping for a new entry to the series, and F-Zero 99 has been viewed as Nintendo potentially gauging interest.





 

The 99-player game mode is a novel idea, but the emphasis on avoiding elimination isn&#39;t quite the same as F-Zero&#39;s signature gameplay, which puts a priority on map memorization for optimizing lap times. Classic mode, however, feels like a much more pointed attempt at seeing how popular the series&#39; style of racing still is. F-Zero and F-Zero X are already part of the NSO retro library (and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity is one of the confirmed GBA games coming to NSO in the future), but with 99 being the latest release and likely having the most active player base, it&#39;s probably the best grounds for such a test.

However, there&#39;s no guarantee that this is the case. Much like F-Zero 99 as a whole, Classic mode could just be a way to satiate fans without investing in a full release, with the added bonus of creating another incentive for subscribing to Nintendo Switch Online. Nintendo&#39;s first-party racing line-up is dominated by Mario Kart, so from a business standpoint, F-Zero does seem superfluous. F-Zero 99 has proven that there&#39;s still novel ideas to be squeezed out of the series, however, and a brand-new, full release would be more than welcome.
