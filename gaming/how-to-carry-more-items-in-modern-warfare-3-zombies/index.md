## Literature Review

Items and loot from each deployment in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies are sometimes too abundant to carry, unless you make space for more in your loadout.





One reason why expanding your inventory is so important comes from the different Schematics in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, which allow you to craft various weapons and gear. These take up a slot in your item storage and are not permanent editions to your Acquisition Stash until you exfil from the map. The extra space Schematics take up will limit the amount of room you have for other items you may come across.

 How To Get The Rucksack In MW3 Zombies 
          

The only way to carry more items in MW3 Zombies is to get a larger Rucksack by finding one in a Locker or purchasing a bigger bag from a Buy Station. You start deployments with a Small Rucksack with 5 item slots until you obtain a Medium or Large-sized backpack from around Urzikstan. A Medium Rucksack has 7 slots for various loot, while a Large Rucksack has 9 slots to carry all your items.

The most common spot for getting a Rucksack is a Buy Station, which sells everything from weapons to Perk-A-Cola flavors in MW3 Zombies. You could also try to empty Lockers, chests, or caches in places with a higher infected population for rarer rewards. You are likely to find an upgraded Rucksack in areas that host a larger number of zombies than in safe zones closer to the edge of the map.






Lockers are the best places to search for larger Rucksacks, and can usually be found in police stations or any military building scattered around Urzikstan.




Once you gain a bigger Rucksack, you&#39;ll notice it immediately in your Loadout when you customize your character for deployments. While this doesn&#39;t affect the amount of gear you can bring into Urzikstan, it does impact the number of items you can take from the zombie-infested area. Those who get a larger Rucksack can carry far more items in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 rewarded from Contract missions.
