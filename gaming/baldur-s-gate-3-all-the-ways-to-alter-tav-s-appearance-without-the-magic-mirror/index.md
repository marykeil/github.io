## Literature Review

While Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers players many options when creating a custom character, there a still a few ways to alter their appearance once in-game.




Although Baldur’s Gate 3 offers plenty of options when making a new custom character, there are still some who may want to change Tav once their adventure has begun. After many requests, developer Larian Studios added the Magic Mirror in Patch 3 allowing custom character appearances to be altered after leaving the character creator. However, there are still other ways Tav’s appearance can be changed without needing this magical item.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
While there are many who will spend hours in character creation to achieve the perfect look for a custom character, there are others who don’t mind if Tav’s appearance changes throughout the course of Baldur’s Gate 3. This can be done through permanent and non-permanent means from the very beginning right through to the end of Baldur’s Gate 3. From items to encounters, below are all the ways to alter a character’s appearance without needing the Magic Mirror.
            
 
 How To Change Your Appearance In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
You can now change your character’s appearance in Baldur’s Gate 3. Here’s what you can alter and what is off the table when using the Magic Mirror.












 








 7  Dirt, Blood, &amp; Bruises After Battles In BG3 
Alters Appearance Until A Short Or Long Rest
        

One of the most noticeable and common ways that a character’s appearance will change is after battles. All characters, player characters and companions, after ending a fight will often be covered in blood and sometimes grime. These realistic touches can make even the most bookish wizard look like a hardened adventurer, and the effect will persist even after healing.
Blood, acid, and other substances can be washed off characters and surfaces with the create water spell, a sponge, or soap. 

Another cool effect in BG3 is that if a character’s heath is particularly low, then their appearance will reflect that. Cuts and bruises will cover the character’s face during cutscenes, showing the damage they have sustained in battle clearly. As with the blood and grime, these effects will remain until healing or either a short or long rest is taken.





 6  Using Disguise Self Or The Mask Of The Shapeshifter 
Spells &amp; Legendary Items Can Temporarily Change A Character’s Race


 







Another temporary to change a character’s appearance is to use either a spell or legendary item. The spells disguise self and seeming both change the appearance of targets using illusion magic. Disguise self is a level one spell that only targets the caster, who can choose from either the male or female versions of all the playable races. Seeming is a fifth level spell that can change the appearance of all four active party members to randomly chosen disguises. Characters can then use can action to don a new disguise once or to dispel the disguise.
The Mask of the Shapeshifter is one of Baldur’s Gate 3’s five legendary armor pieces and can be found in the camp traveler’s chest. This helmet acts the same as the disguise self spell, but does not use a spell slot and has no limits to how many times it can be used per long rest. The Mask of the Shapeshifter is perfect for squeezing through small spaces as a smaller race or speaking with the recently departed if the party have just killed them.





 5  Auntie Ethel’s Hag Eye 
Take Ethel’s Offer To Remove The Parasite
        

For a more permanent change to a BG3 character’s look, Auntie Ethel is more than happy to help. The NPC can be first met in the Druid Grove and will invite the party to her home to the south of the Blighted Village. Once there, Ethel will reveal herself to be a hag and make an offer to remove the troublesome tadpoles in exchange for one Tav’s eyes. When asked about why she wants an eye, Ethel will be evasive and simply state that it’s her business.
This deal will be unavailable if Tav has already given up an eye to Volo or when playing as Wyll. 

If the party agree to this deal, Ethel will kindly let Tav choose which eye she’s going to &#34;kiss&#34; before plucking it out. Then Ethel will return the eye, leaving the character with a permanently clouded appearance in that eye. From then on, that character will have the permanent BG3 condition Paid the Price, which gives a plus one bonus to Intimidation checks, but disadvantage to all Perception checks and attacks against hags.





 4  The Astral-Touched Tadpole Changes A Character’s Face 
New Illithid Powers Are Granted By The Astral-Touched Tadpole


 







At the beginning of Act 3 the true identity of BG3&#39;s Dream Guardian will be revealed as the Emperor, who will offer the party a special Astral-Touched Tadpole. With this tadpole, characters will be able to unlock more illithid powers and the Emperor&#39;s argument is that this will make the party more likely to succeed when fighting against the Absolute. While there are some benefits to using this new tadpole, it really comes down to play style and personal preference.
            
 
 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Should You Use The Astral-Touched Tadpole? 
Using the Astral-Touched Tadpole in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 grants access to some incredibly powerful abilities - but it also comes with certain costs.



However, for those who do use the Astral-Touched Tadpole, there are some permanent appearance changes to consider. As the parasite unlocks more illithid potential, thick black veins will spread across the character&#39;s face, significantly altering their complexion. While companions will initially have something to say about Tav&#39;s new visual look, other NPCs will not comment, and it will have no impact on how quests proceed other than giving the character new powers.





 3  Volo’s Ersatz Eye Is A Useful Change 
Volo’s Incompetence Lets You See Invisibility
        

Similarly to Auntie Ethel, world renown author Volothamp Geddarm is also sure that he can help Tav get rid of their mind flayer parasite. Volo will boast that he is capable of performing the surgery necessary to remove the tadpole. In one of the funniest Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 moments, Volo will dig around in the character&#39;s eye before popping it out and dropping it in the mud.
Volo will not perform the surgery on a character who already has taken the deal from Auntie Ethel and has lost an eye, but another companion can be chosen to approach him. 

To compensate Tav for his error, Volo will replace the eye with Volo&#39;s Ersatz Eye, which acts as a permanent condition as well as altering the character&#39;s appearance. Volo&#39;s Ersatz Eye allows the character with it to see invisible creatures, which is extremely useful later in BG3. While the cosmetic change is minimal with a blue glow, it is an interesting one.





 2  Wild Shape Into Animals To Explore 
Druid’s Wild Shape Has Many Different Appearances


 







Druids have the opportunity to temporarily alter their appearances by using Wild Shape, one of the key features of their class. Wild Shape allows druids to turn into various animals and is great to use in combat, but is also great for scouting in BG3. When trying to view a large area, the dire raven is an awesome choice while the cat is perfect for squeezing through cracks to get into new areas.
            
 
 10 Coolest Druid Wild Shape Forms In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Ranked Worst To Best 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a plethora of Wild Shape forms for druids to transform into. But some are definitely better than others in more ways than one.



All druids can Wild Shape, but Circle of the Moon druids are able to do this as a bonus action while in combat rather than using an action. Circle of the Moon also offers some of the more robust wild shape options designed for combat as well as utility. However, out of combat it is also extremely fun to roam about the many locations in Baldur’s Gate 3 as an animal, chatting to fellow beasts.





 1  Become An Illithid For A Total Transformation 
Karlach &amp; Tav Can Become Mind Flayers In Act 3
        

Finally, for one of the most permanent and extreme appearance changes, Tav or Karlach can become an illithid. The choice is offered close to the end of Baldur’s Gate 3; the party will face a choice in how they go about defeating the Netherbrain. While there is the choice to side with the Emperor or Prince Orpheus, there is the third choice for either Tav or Karlach to become a mind flayer.
As the protection of the Astral Prism is lowered, the chosen character will gruesomely transform into a new illithid before the shield is raised around their mind again. Disappointingly, the new mind flayer has a rather generic appearance, rather than something that somewhat reflects the character they were before. Obviously, becoming an illithid will have some consequences in how some NPCs will react, so it is not a decision to take lightly when playing Baldur’s Gate 3.
