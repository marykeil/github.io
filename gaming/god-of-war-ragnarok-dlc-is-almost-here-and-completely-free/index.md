## Literature Review

God of War Ragnarok&#39;s roguelite DLC Valhalla has been revealed at The Game Awards 2023 and will be completely free.




Santa Monica Studio has revealed a trailer for God of War Ragnarök&#39;s first DLC, Valhalla. The surprise reveal came at 2023&#39;s The Game Awards.




God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla will see Kratos embark upon a &#34;deeply personal and reflective journey towards a future he never thought possible&#34; in Valhalla, and will incorporate brand-new elements inspired by the roguelite genre. The official trailer, which can be found on the PlayStation YouTube channel revealed that the DLC will be completely free, intended as a way for Santa Monica Studio to wish its community a happy holiday. Valhalla will be available from December 12, 2023, on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 devices.


 

                  God of War: Ragnarök Review - A Fantastic Reimagined Saga   God of War: Ragnarök sets out to improve every criticism of its predecessor, all while delivering a compelling story set in a highly reimagined saga.   





 Valhalla Will Be An Epilogue To God of War Ragnarök 
But Is Intended As A &#34;Separate Experience&#34;
         

An accompanying article on the PlayStation Blog stated that God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla is an epilogue to the events of the main game and is set after the final battle against Odin. While it will therefore include narrative spoilers, it is also intended as a &#34;separate experience&#34; from God of War: Ragnarök.

This means that players who want to jump into the roguelite story can do so at any time without having to worry about carrying over upgrades, equipment, or story progression from the main game, as Kratos will have access to all his weapons and fully upgraded skill trees at all times. Players will have to commit to a shield and path of Spartan Rage for each attempt, however, and will make choices between temporary Glyphs for which Stats to upgrade, which Perks to select, which Runic Attacks to wield, and more to make each attempt to venture through Valhalla feel unique.




God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla will also have five difficulty settings that are designed to complement the roguelite gameplay and can be swapped between at any time. Each difficulty setting will increase the rewards attainable from each battle. Some of these rewards seem to be customizable armor for Kratos, although this will be purely cosmetic with no impact on gameplay, with Santa Monica Studio encouraging using them in the game&#39;s Photo Mode.
