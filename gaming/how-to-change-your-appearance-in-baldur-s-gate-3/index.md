## Literature Review

You can now change your character’s appearance in Baldur’s Gate 3. Here’s what you can alter and what is off the table when using the Magic Mirror.





There are a few limitations when it comes to changing your appearance after you have already started the campaign, so you will not be able to essentially create a new character mid-game. Nevertheless, this option is easily one of the best changes in Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 3. This update also tweaked some performance issues – mainly in Act 3 – and applied some improvements to Gale’s behavior with the player. The game also received Mac support with Patch 3, expanding the potential player base.




  


 What You Can Change In Your Appearance In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

To get started with changing your character&#39;s looks, you must first interact with Magic Mirror in your campsite. You can use this mirror as many times as you want, and there is no cost involved in re-customizing your playable avatar. Once you&#39;re in the menu, you will see a familiar character customization menu you saw in the beginning. Here you can change your facial appearance, hairstyle, eye colors, voice type, identity, scars, tattoos, and accessories.



The location of the Magic Mirror in your camp will vary according to the camp type you are currently hosted in, much like the Companions’ tents.







 If your character is a tiefling, you will be able to change their horns if you want something slightly different. The changes through the Magic Mirror can be as drastic as you want. You can either completely overhaul your character or make subtle changes that you find bothersome.



 What You Cannot Change With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Camp Mirror 
          

There are some limitations regarding mid-game customization with the Magic Mirror feature in your campsite. When re-customizing your character, you cannot change their race. Baldur’s Gate 3’s races play an important part in your character’s construction, and while it does not influence the story itself, it does have significant changes to stats.

The same applies to a character&#39;s subrace and body type. Every race has four body types; unfortunately, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 does not allow customization for this category as of writing. If you started your campaign with an Origin character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you will not be able to customize any feature in the Magic Mirror either. You will also not be able to customize any Companions. Essentially, the Magic Mirror exists to serve new and original characters created at the start of each campaign.




Though there are limitations with the feature, being able to change your character’s appearance in Baldur’s Gate 3 has long been demanded by players – a demand that has finally been attended by Larian.
