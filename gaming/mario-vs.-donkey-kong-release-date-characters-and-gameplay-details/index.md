Nintendo Switch Exclusive
         




Mario vs. Donkey Kong will be released exclusively for the Nintendo Switch on February 16, 2024, in both digital and physical versions, for an MSRP of $49.99 USD. It is already available for pre-order from many retailers as well as the online Nintendo Store.

 The Story Of Mario Vs. Donkey Kong 
Originally Designed As A Successor To The 1994 Donkey Kong
          

In the original Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Mario owns Mario&#39;s Toy Company, which makes Mini-Mario wind-up toys. Donkey Kong wants one of these toys but when he finds the store is sold out, Donkey Kong becomes angry and breaks into the toy factory to steal all the Mini-Marios. Mario chases after him and must rescue the Mini-Marios.

Along the way, the Toad employees of Mario&#39;s Toy Company also become kidnapped by Donkey Kong, giving Mario even more victims to rescue. Each world that Mario traverses in this chase culminates in an epic arcade-inspired battle against Donkey Kong, with the hopeful resolution of saving the day and putting everything back to the way it should be.




                  2023 Was A Nintendo Disaster For One Weird Reason   Nintendo didnâ€™t really have a bad year in 2023 overall, but there was one particular thing missing from the year that has seemed to be overlooked.   



 Everything Changed In Mario Vs. Donkey Kong&#39;s Remake 
Remake Adds New Twists Not Seen In The Game Boy Advance Version
          

From what has been shown and announced thus far, it appears as though the basic story of Mario vs. Donkey Kong remains the same, but updated with new cutscenes that are fully animated rather than static frames. Several changes have been made to the gameplay, including some new modes to make the game either easier or harder. Casual mode will make the game much simpler with new Bubbles that can provide extra hit points for Mario to have more chances when things go wrong, save checkpoints, and it removes the timer. Time Attack mode and the unlockable Plus Levels and Expert Levels will give new challenges for players who want the bar raised.




 All Known Differences In The Mario Vs. Donkey Kong Remake   Two-player local co-op play   Casual mode added   Time Attack mode added   Unlockable Plus Levels and Expert Levels   Two new worlds: Merry Mini-Land and Slippery Summit   New obstacles and puzzles   Updated graphics and music   



Two new worlds have been added to Mario vs. Donkey Kong, full of new puzzles, themes, and enemies. Merry Mini-Land is an amusement park-themed world, and Slippery Summit provides a winter wonderland theme with levels full of icy platforms. The addition of these two worlds brings the total number of levels in the game up from the original 118 to over 130.


 




For the graphics in Mario vs. Donkey Kong, the game has been modernized to use 3D models rather than pre-rendered sprites, giving it a more fluid movement and feeling more like the Super Mario games that have been released more recently. Other small graphical changes have been made as well, such as the Tane Pakkun being redesigned as mechanical Fire Piranha Plants, and the Brickmen have been given eyebrows.

Mario vs Donkey Kong is labeled as a puzzle platformer, with a lot of challenging situations to solve in addition to watching out for enemies. The levels have various tools to use and buttons that can make platforms appear or disappear as needed. In each level, Mario needs to find and rescue all Mini-Marios and lead them to their toy box, often crossing dangerous areas and in places where they might not be able to follow Mario, such as climbing ladders.
