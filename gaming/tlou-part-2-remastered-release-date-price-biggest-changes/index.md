## Literature Review

The Last of Us Part 2&#39;s remaster has been announced by Sony and Naughty Dog with all-new content and enhancements to utilize the PS5&#39;s hardware.




The Last of Us Part 2&#39;s PlayStation 5 remaster has been announced by Sony and Naughty Dog. The award-winning sequel was released on PlayStation 4 in 2020 and was already praised for its visuals, performance, and wealth of accessibility features on last-gen hardware, but the remaster seems to come with even further enhancements and content to take advantage of the newer console.




The Last of Us Part 2 is currently available on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility, and although many were hoping for a free upgrade patch akin to those seen in PS4 games such as Resident Evil 7: Biohazard or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to provide better frame rates and graphics. However, considering the original The Last of Us game was remastered for PS4 and was later re-released as The Last of Us Part 1 on PS5 in August 2022 - with a PC release in March 2023 - it seemed inevitable that its sequel would receive the same treatment.

 TLOU2 Remastered&#39;s Release Date, Special Editions &amp; Pricing 
There Is An Upgrade Fee For Those Who Owned The Game On PS4
         

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches on PlayStation 5 on January 19, 2024. Pre-orders will be available beginning December 5, both for the Standard Edition, and the W.L.F. Edition of the game, the latter of which will include the following:




The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered: W.L.F. Edition

  SteelBook display case   4 enamel pins   Washington Liberation Front Patch   47 Society of Champions trading cards (including 8 holographic cards)  

Those who already own The Last of Us Part 2 on PS4 can upgrade to the Remastered version on PS5 for $10 at launch, but Sony has yet to confirm the pricing for the game&#39;s standalone edition. As of the time of writing, the PS4 version of the game is retailing at $39.99 on the US PlayStation Store, so purchasing this version now and the PS5 upgrade at launch would pay a total of $49.99. However, it is worth noting that the PS4 version&#39;s pricing could change during Sony&#39;s Winter Sales before The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&#39;s January launch.

This upgrade path matches Sony&#39;s previous ones for titles like Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PS4 just a month after The Last of Us 2 in 2020 and had a Director&#39;s Cut release on PS5 in 2021 with new content. Much like Ghost of Tsushima: Director&#39;s Cut and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man Remastered, players will also be able to import their saves from the original PS4 game to The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. Importing PS4 saves will automatically unlock players&#39; pre-existing PS4 trophies in the new PS5 version, which could grant an instant Platinum trophy for those who have already 100% completed the game.






Upgrades for disc copies of the PS4 version of The Last of Us Part 2 are only available on PlayStation 5 consoles with a disc drive. Owners of PS4 disc copies must also insert the disc into the PS5 every time they want to download or play the PS5 digital version.






 The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered&#39;s Upgrades Explained 
The PS5 Version Will Have Native 4K And An Unlocked Framerate
         

According to Sony&#39;s announcement on the PlayStation Blog, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will feature a variety of enhanced graphics options. These include native 4K output in Fidelity Mode, 1440p upscaled to 4K in Performance Mode, and an unlocked framerate option for TVs that support variable refresh rates. The remaster also has increased texture resolution and an improved level of detail at greater distances, as well as improved shadow quality, animation sampling rate, and more.

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will also utilize the PlayStation 5&#39;s more powerful hardware to allow for improved loading times over the original PS4 version. The DualSense controller&#39;s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers have also been fully configured for the remaster for better immersion in both the game&#39;s combat and exploration, providing different kinds of tension and feedback depending on the weapons used or the terrain being traversed.






 The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered Has Two New Modes 
There Are Also Several Unlockable Cosmetics
          

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will feature two new modes. These include the unlockable Speedrun Mode that was introduced in 2022&#39;s The Last of Us Part 1 remake, and a completely new roguelike survival mode called No Return. In The Last of Us Part 1, Speedrun Mode was unlocked upon beating the game on Normal difficulty, and it&#39;s possible that it will be unlocked the same way in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. This makes sense as Speedrun Mode requires some understanding of the game, as the aim is to beat the game as quickly as possible, with a timer displayed in the corner of the screen to track this.



The Speedrun Mode&#39;s timer only counts gameplay and pauses automatically during cutscenes.







The roguelike survival mode, No Return is a completely new addition to the series, however. No Return sees players planning runs for supplies and rewards, and have randomized encounters with enemies that provide a new combat experience. No Return features a variety of playable characters, some of which have never been playable in the franchise before. Each of these characters have their own unique traits which can suit different playstyles such as stealth. There are seven characters currently confirmed to be playable in No Return, and it&#39;s possible more may be unlockable or added post-launch:

  Abby Anderson   Ellie   Tommy   Dina   Jesse   Lev   Mel  



No Return can unlock bonus characters, skins, and more, adding to the new skins for Ellie, Abby, and their weapons that have been added in The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.

 The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered Has Guitar Free Play 
Ellie Can Play The Guitar More Often
          

Throughout The Last of Us Part 2&#39;s story, there are specific sections where Ellie can play the guitar gifted to her by Joel, and others in the game&#39;s world. When a guitar is picked up in the game, the player is required to play through a specific song via a mini-game in which they will just need to follow along with the song and pick the appropriate notes when they are highlighted on the screen. After playing the song correctly, players will be able to practice with the guitar more freely.

Although there are scripted moments such as Ellie being able to perform an acoustic cover of Aha&#39;s Take On Me to Dina, those who were more musically versed then discovered how to play other songs using this mechanic, and it became a popular part of the game. Naughty Dog has taken notice of this popularity and has introduced a new Guitar Free Play mode. This new mode comes with a variety of unlockable guitars, uses audio FX pedals to modulate a performance, and has the option to play as different characters in various in-game locations to customize the atmosphere and mood while playing a certain genre of song.

Other than these new gameplay modes, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will include plenty of new content. This includes &#34;Lost Levels&#34;, which consists of three playable levels that were cut early in development: &#34;Boar Hunt&#34;, &#34;Jackson Party&#34; and &#34;Sewers&#34;. These aren’t fully finished levels, but function as a glimpse into some of the early-development ideas that can further explore the world of the game. These levels also feature embedded developer commentary to discuss the intention behind aspects of each level and give them richer context.




There is also a newly recorded Director’s Commentary from director Neil Druckmann, narrative lead Halley Gross, and actors Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, and Laura Bailey, who play Joel, Ellie, and Abby in the game, respectively. This can be played across the campaign’s cutscenes to offer further insight into The Last of Us Part 2&#39;s story and characters and the overall creative process.
