## Literature Review

For those who want to get in every locked door in Alan Wake II, they will need to find the screwdriver to improvise in lieu of keys.





In Alan Wake II, there are two main playable protagonists, Alan and Saga, that the players can switch between mostly at will after the beginning of the game. It is during Sagaâ€™s storyline that players will be able to find the screwdriver, as it is a necessary piece for advancing her story. It will be a key item for entering the nearby Gift Shop and finding all the clues in Coffee World in Watery, WA.

 Locating the Screwdriver in Alan Wake 2 
          

By the time players head to Watery, WA, they can choose whether to play as Saga or Alan. Play as Saga so that you can head to Coffee World in the main story to get the screwdriver as soon as possible. Saga heads to Coffee World and the Gift Shop within to find a trailer among other things. Coffee World will be abandoned except for cultists, so be cautious as you navigate it and be on the lookout for enemies.

To open the door to the Gift Shop, players will have to find the Screwdriver. It is located within the Perculator ride, which is marked on the map and is in the Southeast corner of Coffee World. After you make your way to the ride, the doors to it will automatically open and two cultists will attack you.






The ride will also start moving, and the teacups will be spinning and possibly obscuring your view, so stay on the move if possible.




One of the cultists is located above the ride on top of one of the teacups, which can be taken out fairly easily with a crossbow, one of the weapons in Alan Wake II. The other is on the ride itself. Once both are dead, the ride will come to a stop and players can search it for the screwdriver. It is located in a small box on the side of the fencing of the ride. Open it and return back to the Gift Shop to continue solving mysteries in Alan Wake II.
