# Baldurs Gate 3s Gale Might Be A Rare Type Of Spellcaster


## SUMMARY 



  Gale&#39;s stories about his magical abilities don&#39;t add up, suggesting that he might be a rare sorcerer instead of a wizard.   There are inconsistencies between how wizards typically gain their magic in Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Gale&#39;s claims about his magic.   There is evidence that Gale was unusually powerful even before the events of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, possibly rivaling Elminster, and Mystra showed interest in him due to his extraordinary abilities.

## Literature Review

Gale in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will happily tell players about his magical abilities, but some of what he says don&#39;t match up with wizards in D&amp;D.




Gale Dekarios is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s resident wizard, available as a playable Origin character as well as romance option, who will happily talk anybody&#39;s ear off about all things magic. However, there may be more to this loquacious spellcaster than first meets the eye. Because for all his talk about Mystra and his beloved cat, Gale&#39;s tales of his magical abilities don&#39;t quite add up.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]

Gale is one of six Origin characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 who come with fully fleshed out backstories ready to be dug into. As well as being one of 10 companions ready to join Tav in taking down the Absolute, Gale is also a potential love interest, and those who choose to pursue this have the chance to learn more than most about the at times cocky wizard. However, it is through Gale’s stories that inconsistencies with how wizards get their magic in Dungeons &amp; Dragons start to crop up.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Gale Might Be A Sorcerer Who Became A Wizard 
          




There is no doubting that prior to getting an illithid tadpole inserted in his ocular region, Gale was a powerful spellcaster, something he will happily tell the other companions about. However, there are some lines of dialogue for Gale that are found if he is played as an Origin character along with a letter from Elminster in the new BG3 epilogue, which might go some way to explain why and what made him so special to Mystra. Both point to Gale casting spells at a very young age, far too young for the average wizard, indicating that Gale might be a rare type of sorcerer.



 BG3 Hold Evidence To Source Of Gale&#39;s Magic 
         

When talking with Gale during any playthrough where he is not the player character, Gale will speak about his connection to the Weave, the source of magic within BG3&#39;s setting of the Forgotten Realms. During one scene, Gale will explain that he is a wizarding prodigy who could use magic from the Weave from a very young age. It is this that caught the attention of Mystra, the goddess of magic, who went on to name Gale her Chosen.




However, using magic from an early age is very rare among wizards who typically study for years to achieve their magic. In BG3, and in DnD, spellcasters get their magic from different sources. For clerics and warlocks it is from an external source, for sorcerers in it innate as something in their bloodline gives them their powers, while for wizards it is from studying magic in a similar way to mathematical equations.


 

This does not quite match up with what Gale tells other characters in BG3 when speaking about his magic and abilities. If Gale is played as an Origin character in a conversation with Halsin in Act 2, where Gale can share a story with Halsin about casting his first spell, “while still a babe”. This is not the only example of Gale talking about casting spells at a very young age, but there are also examples from other characters.






The conversation with Halsin only has one option about krakens for custom characters, but Origin characters each have their own unique dialogue for this conversation.




In the new BG3 epilogue, if Gale has ascended to godhood, a letter can be found from Elminster. In it, Elminster expresses his disappointment in Gale’s choice but also mentions a specific incident where Gale used fireball to burn a neighbor&#39;s rose bush at eight years old. Given that fireball is a third level spell, it is astonishing that an eight-year-old would have access to that level of magic.



“I&#39;m what one might call a wizard prodigy, who from an early age could not only control the Weave, but compose it, much like a musician or a poet.”




Wizards typically study for years to learn magic, so Gale already having magic as a child is strange. However, there may be a way to explain this and also explain why Gale was such a powerful spellcaster before the events of BG3. There is the possibility that Gale is a rare type of sorcerer who draws magic from the Weave itself and then went on to choose to study magic like a wizard.




This also goes some way to explaining why the orb didn’t kill him and why Mystra had him as her Chosen at such a young age. Mystra will describe in a meeting with Gale that takes place in Act 3 of BG3, that when the Karsite Weave, the orb, entered him the first thing it consumed were his gifts. The orb fed on Gale&#39;s innate magic first, which goes some way to explain why such a powerful and destructive thing didn&#39;t kill him outright. After the meeting, Gale will speak with the rest of the party, berating himself for not realizing sooner what he held within him. It is here that he refers to himself as an archmage, a considerable accomplishment for someone of Gale&#39;s age.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It)   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.   



 Gale Was Unusually Powerful Before BG3 
          




Before the events of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 there is evidence that Gale was a phenomenally powerful spellcaster, perhaps even rivaling Elminster. This is alluded to in several scenes where Gale mentions abilities he once had or in scenes where his powers can be witnessed once the orb is being dampened by Mystra. There is also evidence that Mystra was concerned about Gale&#39;s power and ambition, which may be why she chose to directly involve herself in his life.

There was a scene in BG3&#39;s early access where Gale talked about a spell he used to cast with ease. He says that he could make fire come alive and take the shape of a dragon, but now he cannot. He is most likely talking about the cantrip control flames, and in the scene, Gale gets angry with himself before going on to describe how he would silence a beholder with a word and lift towers from their foundations.

Struggling with a cantrip aside, Gale speaks about dealing with powerful creatures, such as beholders, with ease. It&#39;s not an easy feat for a spellcaster as beholders emit antimagic cones from their central eye. But this isn&#39;t the only example of Gale being extremely powerful before the events of BG3.




In Gale&#39;s Act 2 romance scene, he is able to use the Weave to intertwine his spirit with his lover&#39;s. He describes it as bonding the way that gods do, but whatever way it is looked at, it is incredibly powerful magic. This speaks to Gale&#39;s connection with the Weave, something he is only able to access once more in Act 2 once Elminster has administered the assistance from Mystra.

In the same scene, Gale is able to push back the Shadow Curse to create an illusion of the night sky. Gale will explain that this is not something he can do often, but as it might be his last night alive, he wanted it to be special. This casual hand waves away the fact that Gale is able to subdue a curse from a god, in this case Shar, with his own magic.

With Mystra allowing the orb to feed directly from the Weave, it is apparently letting Gale access his magic more freely now. If Gale was a sorcerer whose power came directly from the Weave, then she obviously would had taken notice of that, and perhaps desired to control his journey. This is hinted at by Raphael in a new epilogue if Gale attempts to use the crown but fails, where he thanks the player for reigniting Gale&#39;s ambition, which Mystra had &#34;cleverly put to rest&#34;.




Gale&#39;s ambition is one of his core traits, something that can be tempered or encouraged by the player. It seems natural that someone with innate magical abilities and ambition would want to enhance them by choosing to study magic further. But it is mostly definitely something that Mystra would have been wary of, as such a connection to the Weave would have given Gale the opportunity to replace her.

Ultimately, this is just a theory based on scattered information found throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Perhaps as Larian Studios continues to update and expand the game, more will be learned about each companions&#39; backstory. However, for now, Gale prefers to describe himself as a wizard, which will have to suffice until more evidence is found.
