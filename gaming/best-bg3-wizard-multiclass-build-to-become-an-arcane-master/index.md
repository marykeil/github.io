## Literature Review

To create an unbeatable spellcaster in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Wizard players can multiclass into Sorcerer to enhance their spells with Sorcerer Metamagic.





Wizards in Baldur’s Gate 3 wield spells and can add new magic from scrolls to their spellbooks. This ability is one of the most powerful class features in the game, giving your character access to an expanded knowledge base of spells. You can maximize your Wizard’s casting power by multiclassing into Sorcerer, the game’s other major spellcaster class, to take advantage of Metamagic.




  


 How To Build A Multiclass Wizard 
         

Although this build offers a split between the Wizard and Sorcerer classes, starting with a Sorcerer in the character creator is highly recommended. Wizards gain more spells at Level 1, but you won’t have enough Spell Slots early on to wield them all effectively. In contrast, Sorcerers in Baldur’s Gate 3 start off with four Cantrips, which don’t require Spell Slots, two Spells, and a powerful subclass straight away. Some of the best Sorcerer spells in Baldur’s Gate 3 are available at Level 1, so it’s recommended that you prioritize the following:




  Cantrips   Bone Chill, Friends, Ray of Frost, Shocking Grasp    Spells   Magic Missile, Sleep   



Bone Chill, Ray of Frost, and Shocking Grasp are fantastic low-level cantrips, as they can all negatively affect targets. Bone Chill stops targets from healing, while Ray of Frost reduces their movement range. Shocking Grasp allows you to electrocute foes, stopping them from using Reactions. It even gains an Advantage against enemies wearing metal armor. Sleep and Magic Missile are favorites, allowing you to send enemies into a deep magical slumber or hit multiple targets with a single spell.

                  5 Best Multiclass Combinations In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you can create different multiclass builds to best unlock strong hybrid combinations with diverse spellsets and abilities.   

You will also have the chance to pick a subclass. Wild Magic Surges from the Wild Magic subclass tend to be too random to be reliable, so you should aim for Draconic Bloodline or Storm Sorcery. Draconic Bloodline is highly recommended due to its many useful perks:




  Draconic Resilience, which grants you AC 13 when not wearing armor. Wizards and Sorcerers typically don’t wear Armor and can be vulnerable when attacked, so this gives you a decent boost to survivability.   Draconic Resilience Hit Points, which grants you one extra HP for each level of Sorcerer you take. This isn’t particularly strong and doesn’t really stack well until the late game.   Draconic Ancestry, which gives you an extra starting spell. At Level 6, certain spell types gain extra damage based on the Ancestry you choose, and you also gain Resistance to certain damage types.  

You can pick any Draconic Ancestry, but Red (Fire) and Blue (Lightning) are highly recommended. This gives you Burning Hands and Witch Bolt, respectively, both of which are powerful early-game spells. When it comes to picking a character race and subrace, you’ve got several great options:

  High Elf and High Half-Elf both gain an extra Cantrip from the Wizard spell list.   Drow and Drow Half-Elf gain Dancing Lights at Level 1, Faerie Fire at Level 3, and Darkness at Level 5 due to Drow Magic.   Forest Gnomes have Gnome Cunning (Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws) and start with Speak with Animals, one of the best spells in Baldur’s Gate 3.   Tieflings all gain spells at Levels 1, 3, and 5 due to Tiefling Magic.  




You should also aim to get a solid class and Background combination in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Wizards and Sorcerers share some common ground here, so Noble and Sage are your best picks overall.



There are also some excellent Wizard and Sorcerer-based builds for roleplaying as the Dark Urge.






 How To Level A Multiclass Wizard 
         

Once you’ve entered the game proper, continue to level Sorcerer up to Level 3. This gives you access to Metamagic abilities and Sorcery Points. You can spend Sorcery Points to power Metamagic abilities, which enhance your spells. You can pick two essential Metamagic abilities at Level 2 and one more at Level 3.

  Metamagic: Extended Spell doubles the duration of conditions, summons, and surfaces created by spells.   Metamagic: Twinned Spell allows single-target spells to target an additional creature.   Metamagic: Quickened Spell allows you to cast spells with a Bonus Action.  




You can also pick extra spells. At this stage, you have lots of options, but Ice Knife and Hold Person give you some solid crowd control abilities to help your frontline fighters deal more consistent damage.

                  The Best Monk Multiclass Build In Baldur’s Gate 3   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Monk players can massively increase their damage output by multiclassing into Rogue and Fighter, creating a powerful hybrid build.   

At Level 4, start multiclassing into Wizard. Your spell choices don’t matter much here, as you can learn from scrolls and access the vast majority of spells in the game. You also gain Arcane Recovery, which lets you recover Spell Slots. Sorcerers can also spend Sorcery Points to regenerate Spell Slots. This is one of the best aspects of this build, as it solves a common early-game problem where casters have lots of powerful spells but don’t have the Spell Slots to use them.



Learning how to cast spells without spending Spell Slots can help you explore longer between Long Rests.







At Level 5, you can take another Level in Wizard to gain access to your School subclass. Evocation is the best pick for offensive spellcasting power and halves the cost of learning Evocation spells from scrolls. Many of Baldur Gate 3’s most powerful top-level spells are Evocation spells, so this reduces the cost of learning them.

Continue to take Wizard up to Level 4 to unlock more spells, Spell Slots, Arcane Recovery charges, and a Feat. Taking Ability Improvement can help you build up your Intelligence stat. Wizards cast based on Intelligence, while Sorcerers cast on Charisma, so you may need to shore up your INT stat to give your spells more power. Some of the alternatives include:

  Spell Sniper (the number you need to roll for Critical Hits with spells is reduced by 1),   War Caster (gain Advantage to maintain Concentration on spells and cast Shocking Grasp as a Reaction),   Elemental Adept (spells ignore resistance to a selected damage type, and spells of that damage type cannot roll a 1).  




Players have a couple of possible routes: a Wizard 6/Sorcerer 6 split or a Wizard 4/Sorcerer 8 split. The 6/6 split gives you access to extra Arcane Recovery charges and the Potent Cantrip subclass feature, which upgrades your cantrips, so enemies still take damage on misses. However, the 4/8 split is arguably better overall. By reaching Sorcerer Level 8, you gain many Sorcery Points that are more flexible than Arcane Recovery charges. You also gain the Draconic Bloodline’s Elemental Affinity features:

  Elemental Affinity: Damage adds extra damage based on your Charisma modifier to spells of your bloodline type.   Elemental Affinity: Resistance allows you to spend a Sorcery Point to gain Resistance to damage of your bloodline type.  

Unfortunately, you miss out on additional Metamagic abilities with a 4/8 split. However, this build puts nearly every spell in the game at your disposal, gives you the resources to use them, and then backs them up with Metamagic effects. The Wizard/Sorcerer is one of the most powerful builds in Baldur’s Gate 3. It is highly recommended for anyone looking to roleplay as a powerful magician with the forces of nature at their fingertips.
