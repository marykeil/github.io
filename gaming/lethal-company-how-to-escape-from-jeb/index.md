## Literature Review

One of the most unique monsters you can encounter in Lethal Company is Jeb, a tentacled beast who you can escape from if you stay careful around it.





You can find Jeb at the Company Moon, where the tentacle monster is listed as a co-worker who trades scraps for money in Lethal Company. Go to the red counter on the Moon to see a space where you can place items you or your team have collected on their expeditions. Near this area, there should be a silver bell that may be used to call Jeb whenever you want to give away offered objects for cash.






To make your ship go to the Company Moon to interact with Jeb, enter &#34;The Company&#34; into the Terminal on your vessel after you input &#34;Moons&#34; from the command screen.




                  Is Lethal Company On PS5 Or Xbox Consoles?   Lethal Company is a smash indie hit on Steam, connecting friends together to investigate dank &amp; creepy corridors, but is it currently on PS5 or Xbox?   


 How To Deal With Jeb in Lethal Company 
          

TThe best way to deal with Jeb is to not make loud sounds near the monster&#39;s counter and not ring the bell more than once. Jeb is easily irritated if you or anyone on your team decides to make a lot of noise near the creature. A tentacle could explode out of the counter and eliminate a member of your crew faster than any bullet from a turret in Lethal Company.




Always back away from the counter after you ring the bell, just in case Jeb is annoyed. Since the tentacle monster is set off by sound, including the noise you and your squad make by talking, it can be hard to determine whether the creature is angry. You can avoid getting grabbed by Jeb&#39;s tentacles if you sprint away from the counter quickly, but this only works with a bit of luck.
