## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Liz Woods looks very happy embracing her new life as she dates a mystery man after allegedly breaking up with Big Ed Brown.




90 Day: The Last Resort alum Liz Woods has been hinting at her split with Big Ed Brown even though the couple has yet to confirm the rumors. Big Ed, 56, first starred in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4 with Rose Vega from the Philippines. However, Rose broke up with Big Ed when he insulted her for having body hair and bad breath. Big Ed also lied to Rose about his height and didn’t tell her he didn’t want children. After his split with Rose, Big Ed started dating waitress manager Liz on 90 Day: The Single Life after meeting her at his favorite restaurant.




Big Ed and Liz broke up the first time during season 1, and by the time they starred in 90 Day: The Last Resort, they’d broken up 13 times. Their trust issues and large age gap played a major role in their relationship issues, but couples therapy seemed to work in their favor. Big Ed and Liz decided to get married, which they reportedly did in August 2023. Big Ed started working as a real estate agent while Liz gave up the partnership position she was offered in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7, so she could live with Big Ed in their new home in Arkansas.
