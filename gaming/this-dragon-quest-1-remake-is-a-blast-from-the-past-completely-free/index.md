## Literature Review

The fan-made Dragon Quest &#43; is an impressive remake of the first DQ game with new dungeons and postgame content, and it&#39;s completely free to play.




Dragon Quest&#43; is a new fan-made remake of the first Dragon Quest game, and it&#39;s completely free to play. The impressive remake was created in the RPGMaker engine, but it looks, plays, and feels like an updated but faithful rendition of the classic Dragon Quest title. Even better, it includes new content like dungeons, weapons, and armor - and the postgame content even includes a new world inspired by Dragon Quest Monsters 2.




For anyone eagerly awaiting the release of Dragon Quest 3 H2-2D remake, DQ&#43; is an excellent way to revisit a classic game through a new lens. Created by NightFly Studio, Dragon Quest&#43; is a passion project in the works for over a decade. It has great attention to detail and can be downloaded for free. There are also patches that address a few of the minor bugs that affected the game at launch, showing the indie dev&#39;s dedication to post-launch support.



Dragon Quest&#43; is a fan remake and is not affiliated with Square Enix, Armor Project, Bird Studio, or any other of its respective owners.





 Changes &amp; Improvements Are In Dragon Quest&#43; 
          

There are numerous changes in the fan-made Dragon Quest remake beyond the noticeable graphical enhancements, including new story beats. The hero will start off without his iconic armor pieces until he acquires them through the narrative (a bit of a plot hole the original game skimmed over due to technological constraints). There&#39;s also a ship now (originally not featured in-game until DQ2) to make traversal easier and an orchestral soundtrack. Rather than going back to Tantegel Castle to save the game with the king, churches allow the player to save their progress like in later Dragon Quest entries.




                  &#34;Brimming With Potential&#34; - Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince Preview   We went hands-on with Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, and the game is brimming with potential.    

There are new locations and dungeons, new weapons and armor, and even the monsters have been changed - or &#34;remixed.&#34; Postgame content includes a dungeon inspired by DQ Monsters, and a new world to explore that&#39;s inspired by Dragon Quest Monsters 2. The original DQ1 is an admittedly short game, which means the remake&#39;s added content can keep the fun times going even longer.
