## Literature Review

Assaults allow you to call in extra characters not already in Star Ocean The Second Story R’s active party. They cost no MP, but have long cooldowns.





Because inactive party members mainly use Assaults, it can wind up being very important who you recruit but don’t plan on using in the main party. Even if a mage like Leon or Celine seems out of place in the active roster, they can be incredible as an Assault to call in. Additionally, several heroes from games like Star Ocean: The Divine Force can be used as a backup.





 Party Assaults 
          

The main form of Assault actions requires having some characters out of the party. This will typically be used once you have five or more party members. Though, you can place people in the reserve line even before reaching this number. Assaults are assigned in the Special Arts/Spell menu when out of combat. On console controllers, a character Assault can be assigned to any of the four directional pad buttons, allowing a maximum of four extra moves.



Assaults can be any special ability or spell. This includes buffing and healing, in addition to attacks. You can use powerful moves like Opera’s Healing Star or Noel’s Faerie Light to keep everyone safe.




Assaults cost no MP to use and instead have a recharge time. The stronger and higher level moves tend to have the longest timers, upwards of a whole minute to cool down. This makes it important to time Assaults at the right moment to hit as many enemies, or make buffs last as long as possible. Change Assaults to fit the current party and boss best.






 Assault Jewels 
          

If you don’t currently have extra party members or don’t like their attacks, another option is using Assault Jewels. These call upon heroes from past Star Ocean games to help assist. But sadly, they have no story relevance and lack any dialogue.

 Character  Original Game  Ability  Requirement   Laeticia  Star Ocean: The Divine Force   Ultime Camui: Hits every close-by enemy with energy.  Found in a chest inside the Krosse Cave dungeon.   Fayt  Star Ocean: Till the End of Time  Vertical Air Raid: Leaps in and slashes twice.  Perform any other Assaults 50 times.   Roddick  Star Ocean: First Departure  Omega Double Slash: Slash twice from the ground.  Complete any 30 Guild Missions.   Raymond  Star Ocean: The Divine Force  Extreme Daredevil: Pauses momentarily, then charges straight for one enemy.  Use the Fishing system to catch 22 fish. Then speak to the NPC Reel in either Harley or L’Aqua.   Edge  Star Ocean: The Last Hope  Celestial Sword: Slash three times in an arc of flame.  Specifically, fish up a Divine Char near Krosse and give it to Reel.   Fidel  Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness  Ethereal Blast: Fly into the air and completely obliterate a single concentrated point.  Defeat any Raid boss roaming on the world map.   








These summoned Assaults have one attack, making them less versatile compared to the rest of the Star Ocean The Second Story R cast.
