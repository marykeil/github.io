## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

Fans of Mario Kart 8 claim their favorite character is the sure-fire winner, but the roster&#39;s stats may prove that favorite doesn&#39;t always mean best.




Since 1992, Mario Kart players have debated about the best characters in the game, and Mario Kart 8 fans are more passionate than ever about which character deserves first place. Many players pick their racer based on design or personality, but the factors that make the best Mario characters memorable aren&#39;t the same as those that make them the greatest on the racetrack. Speed, acceleration rate, handling, and character weight are all components that factor into the science behind which Mario Kart 8 character is the best to play.
All Mario Kart 8 characters are placed on a weight spectrum indicative of their size: Light, Medium, and Heavy. The heavier characters are favored due to their ability to maintain top speeds, but are slower to accelerate. Lighter characters accelerate more quickly, but have lower top speeds. All of these characters are accessible to pretty much everyone, but they all have their subtle tweaks that can make or break a race. The right combination of racer and kart in Mario Kart 8can make an enormous difference. With the right setup, some characters are downright overpowered at times.
            
 
 13 Fastest Mario Kart 8 Setups 
With hundreds of possible kart combinations, it can be tough for new players to discover the fastest Mario Kart 8 setups. These are the very best.












 








 15  Luigi Is Balanced With Good Handling 
In The Medium Heavy Class
        

Luigi and his big brother Mario are both balanced across almost all stats, with Luigi&#39;s handling being slightly better at a 3.75. When paired with the right loadout for his vehicle and tires, Luigi can zip right through the tracks with ease, especially when utilizing the drafting mechanics.
Luigi doesn&#39;t really have any benefits from being on the higher side of the medium weight class, but that also means he doesn&#39;t have any drawbacks, either. Hits from characters such as Bowser or Donkey Kong won&#39;t have nearly as much knockback to recover from. Luigi may not be the top contender for the best Mario Kart 8 character, but he&#39;s a solid pick in any scenario.





 14  Metal Mario And Pink Gold Peach Have High Traction 
In The Heavy Class
        

While Metal Mario has been around since Mario Kart 7 as an unlockable player, Mario Kart 8 is Pink Gold Peach&#39;s introduction to the series. Neither of these characters have ever achieved the status of fan favorites due to their lackluster, monochrome designs, but they deserve more credit for their weight and top speeds in Mario Kart 8.
These two heavy-class characters are both balanced with the same stats. They are perfect for drifting around corners due to their high traction and decent mini-turbo boosts. Each falls short in regard to handling on land, and especially in water, but pair either of these two speedy powerhouses with a kart combination that favors acceleration, and they are sure to blow past any opponent&#39;s kart.





 13  Shy Guy Has Amazing Acceleration 
In The Light Class
        

This iconic Super Mario ghost returns as a playable character in Mario Kart 8. Ever since being introduced as a guest character in Mario Kart DS, Shy Guy has swiftly grown to be a fan favorite among the Mario Kart community. So much so that, for the first time, players can choose from nine different colored skins made available as DLC.
This cute little masked figure has some of the best acceleration in the game. Being in the Light weight class, Shy Guy will easily be able to weave their way in between other karts with their outstanding traction and handling. But be wary of being trampled over by larger karts when lightning strikes. Although their top speeds are average, the combination of well-timed mini-turbos and excellent acceleration will allow them to recover from the best Mario Kart item attacks. That makes Shy Guy one of the best Light-class characters.





 12  Donkey Kong Is Impossibly Fast With The Right Setup 
In The Heavy Class
        

This classic character has been playable since the dawn of the series. Due to Donkey Kong&#39;s plethora of preexisting self-titled games to choose from, his status among the Mario Kart roster has always made him a popular choice for the best Mario Kart character.
His weight and size make him a formidable foe if ever he gets too close. Unfortunately, he is subject to some of the classic pitfalls of heavy-class characters. As a Heavy-class character, Donkey Kong will weigh down his kart, so make sure to choose wheels that balance this out. The Slick Tires are excellent for all Heavy characters. Donkey Kong may start off slow as the countdown buzzes, but if he manages to maintain a consistent speed and avoid water, there are only a handful of characters on the roster that will be able to take him down.





 11  Waluigi Is Faster Than Ever Before 
In The Heavy Class
        

Waluigi&#39;s antics and idiosyncrasies have resulted in his popularity skyrocketing in recent years, and he&#39;s a quality choice in Mario Kart 8. Having once started out as a middleweight character back in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, he returns to Mario Kart 8 as a default Heavy-class character.
Characteristic of Heavy Mario Kart characters, Waluigi has decent top speeds. His acceleration is decent for the Heavy class, but his handling on land and water causes a shaky ride.Although his acceleration is better than most other characters in his class, it is best to choose a kart that favors this in order to make up for Waluigi&#39;s slower turbo speeds. It&#39;s wise for players to keep Waluigi in the air for as long as possible, as his speed while flying is almost unmatched.





 10  A Mii&#39;s Stats Depend On Their Size 
A Mii&#39;s Weight Class Can Be Customized
        

First introduced during the Mario Kart Wii era, the Mii has received a variety of mixed reviews. As an unlockable character in Mario Kart 8, the Mii ends up being a trickier choice than others due to a crucial choice the player must make.
Miis are fully customizable all the way down to their stats in Mario Kart 8, but that customization takes place separate from the game. A Mii&#39;s stats will depend upon the size and width they were given by the player. The best Miis should fall into the Heavy weight class. If the player&#39;s Mii is scaled with a heavier build and balanced with a kart that favors good handling, they&#39;ll create a force to be reckoned with. Their land speeds will max out with the rest of the top-tier characters, while their traction and acceleration will average out with those in the Medium and Light weight classes.





 9  Dry Bones Has Pros And Cons 
In The Very Light Class
        

A bothersome enemy that only appears in certain, usually desert-themed levels in Mario games, Dry Bones has become a recurring playable character in various Mario spin-off titles. In Mario Kart 8, he is very much a character with pros and cons.
On one hand, Dry Bones has some of the best handling and acceleration in Mario Kart 8. Unfortunately, as a Light character, his top speed and weight are far from the greatest, which forces him to drive defensively in order to keep other characters from catching up or knocking him off the track. Players who know how to make the best use of items and Dry Bones&#39; features, which also include excellent drafting speed, can still make Dry Bones a real contender.





 8  Morton Is The Best Of The Koopas 
In The Very Heavy Class
        

This star-faced Koopaling goes by Morton Koopa Jr., and was introduced back in Super Mario Bros. 3. Normally, he would stand almost statistically identical to his counterpart, Roy, yet in Mario Kart 8, his weight class puts him above average.
An underling of the Koopa king off the track, when he maxes out his speed he becomes a top racer. His extremely high weight allows him to reach speeds most characters can&#39;t, while also maintaining good control of acceleration. Morton falls under the Very Heavy weight class, which means his handling and mini-turbos are some of the worst in the game, so his kart build should focus on compensating for that.





 7  Link Is One Of Mario Kart 8&#39;s Fastest Characters 
In The Heavy Class
        

Link may not talk much, but the hero of Hyrule knows how to race. A total stat score of 21.2 gives him some of the highest stats in Mario Kart 8. Link excels with traction and speed, making him work best on either an ATV or a motorcycle, like his signature Master Cycle Zero.
Link has a speed stat of 4, which makes him one of the fastest characters in the game on his base speed alone. However, that speed doesn&#39;t immediately guarantee a win, because the player still has to master the right timing for drifting, turning, and dodging. Taking sharp corners without losing Link&#39;s speed advantage might sometimes be harder than saving Hyrule, but with a good setup in the hands of an experienced player, Link can hold his own.





 6  Rosalina Is Just As Good As Link 
In The Heavy Class
        

The princess of the cosmos who debuted in Super Mario Galaxy, Rosalina has the exact same stats as Link, which makes her one of the fastest characters in Mario Kart 8. Another aspect she and Link have in common is their weight, which is at the higher end of the Medium class.
Rosalina is not only capable of taking hits from characters without reeling too much, but she also has the ability to deal with more of a knockback than other Medium weight characters. Sadly, this is the only variant of Rosalina in the game that&#39;s not a baby, even though she has become one of the better additions to the Mario games. There&#39;s no such thing as Metal Rosalina just yet.





 5  Bowser Has Some Of The Highest Top Speeds In Mario Kart 8 
In The Very Heavy Class
        

Bowser is the primary antagonist of the Mario franchise, so it is no surprise that he is one of the most powerful characters in Mario Kart 8. He has appeared in every Mario Kart game to date, and due to his popularity, is likely to be a top contender in every game to follow.
Another character in the VIP Very Heavy weight section, Bowser is able to max out at speeds only topped by two other characters in the game. Bowser should avoid water and air travel as much as possible. His handling is some of the worst in Mario Kart 8, so he will be difficult to control in those two situations. On land, however, his weight and speed (when kept consistent) will be able to bully opponents behind his kart, keeping him firmly in first place.

Bowser has been the primary villain for most of Mario&#39;s adventures, but when the next game comes, it may be nice to give another villain a chance.








 4  Baby Mario And Baby Luigi Are The Best In Their Weight Class 
In The Very Light Class
        

While there are many younger versions of Mario characters to choose from, Mario and Luigi are the best of the babies in Mario Kart 8. The baby princesses lag behind only slightly in speed, so they are still very valid choices. But the baby Mario brothers are just ever-so-slightly faster, and that makes a difference.
These diaper dashers are the only members of the Very Light weight class that are able to hold their own with the Heavy weights.Baby Mario and Baby Luigi have the best acceleration and handling in Mario Kart 8. When placed in a Tanooki kart combo that accentuates the babies&#39; lack of weight, there&#39;s an amazing balance of stats that comes together. Drifting is where the babies excel due to the mixture of spectacular traction, top acceleration, and the best mini-turbo boosts in the game.





 3  Yoshi Is A Balanced Racer 
In The Medium Class


 







Mario&#39;s lovable dinosaur Yoshi has been a staple of the franchise since their introduction in Super Mario World, and in Mario Kart 8, Yoshi continues to be a show-stealer. Stats-wise, Yoshi is solid across the board with a strong focus on acceleration, handling, and traction.
Yoshi can get themselves out of the dirt better than most, especially if they are driving an ATV or one of the bigger vehicles. Their medium weight affords them a good balance between speed, acceleration, and handling, making them versatile in any number of situations. The best aspect of Yoshi is the ability to pick any color for them, allowing everyone to have the Yoshi that fits their personal style.





 2  Dry Bowser Is More Than Just A Reskin 
In The Very Heavy Class


 







Thankfully returning to the Mario Kart franchise in the second DLC pack, Dry Bowser comes in as one of the game&#39;s top competitors. Although he may just seem like a re-skin of Bowser, he is able to differentiate himself with a higher weight, which gives him a wonderful advantage.
While some of his stats are lower than most Light and Medium characters in the game, it&#39;s Dry Bowser&#39;s speed that makes him a force to be reckoned with. Dry Bowser falls into the sub-category of Very Heavy. There are only a few characters within the game that are considered to be in the Very Heavy weight class. But Dry Bowser sets himself apart from the others in this class, with better handling and traction that are closer to the overall average of lighter choices.





 1  Wario Is The Best Character In Mario Kart 8 
In The Very Heavy Class


 







One of the few anti-heroes of the franchise, Wario has been able to distinguish himself from the cast of characters, becoming an iconic fan favorite. He has been racing in the franchise since Mario Kart 64, and has managed to maintain his appeal in Mario Kart 8 since its initial launch.
Wario leads the way as the top Very Heavy contender in the game, as he has for years. Whether it be on his personalized motorcycle or in the seat of any combination of karts, his speed and traction are unmatched. If Wario is able to maintain his top speeds without being hit, there are almost no characters who can stay close to him at the front of the pack. He is perfect for tightening drift corners and boosting into first. With his years of experience behind the wheel, and prolific appearances throughout the Mario Kart series, Wario has positioned himself as the best racer in Mario Kart 8.
