## Literature Review

The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria leaves a lot out of its tutorial, but there&#39;s no need to grope about trying to find the answers.




The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria hides plenty of mysteries within the depths of its mines, but this also means that it&#39;s easy to miss out on features and content. Past the opening tutorial, more complex mechanics and discoveries are left for players to figure out on their own accord. This can be a rewarding way to play, but it also means that basic upgrades can be overlooked for far too long, and unique discoveries may go permanently unnoticed.
Getting a good overview of less obvious aspects of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria makes it easier to focus on the intended main challenges, like taking on bosses and gathering rare resources. It also makes it easier to get friends on board for a journey into the gloom, as stumbling about in the dark without much frame of reference can be a harder sell. Regardless of the reason, there&#39;s plenty to gain from finding out some aspects of Return to Moria ahead of time.
            
 
 The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria 
It&#39;s not exactly mithril, but there&#39;s still some solid ore to be found for Dwarves of more modest ambition in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.













 








 10  Deconstructing Objects 
        

Building useful tools like forges and Map Stones is obviously a major part of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, but it&#39;s easy to miss the memo on how to undo the process. Pressing X in front of a construction that can be dismantled brings up the tools to do so. This will drop the crafting materials in its place, making this a vital technique for instances like regaining black diamond from Map Stones. It&#39;s also essentially instantaneous, so it&#39;s much faster than breaking anything down with a pickaxe.





 9  Completing Orc Camps 
        

Although clearing the orcs out of a camp seems like it would be the best way to take care of the situation in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, finishing off the occupants doesn&#39;t finish off the camp. Destroying the central pole structure is necessary to stop them from respawning in the future. Perhaps more importantly, this is also the way to get the key to unlock the orc chest in each camp, which provides a variety of rare supplies, including the crucial black diamonds.

 8  Getting Recipes Through Statues 


 







It might not take too long to figure out the importance of reconstructing statues, but it&#39;s best to get started immediately. Rebuilding Dwarf statues grants recipes for powerful weapons and armor and never requires resources that are too hard to find — in the first few areas, only stone is necessary. Ignoring this mechanic makes it all too easy to fall behind on the curve of combat, so this is a must to avoid getting overwhelmed by hordes of orcs or goblins.

 7  Turning Enemies Against Each Other 
        

Although nothing in Moria seems to get along with Dwarves very well, some of the creatures in its depths also don&#39;t cooperate with each other. Orcs and goblins are more than happy to team up, but beasts like moths or wolves can attack them when provoked. Relying on manipulating these encounters isn&#39;t the most effective approach to combat, but getting wildlife to distract some orcs when on the run can come in handy in a pinch.





 6  Finding Great Forge Parts 


 







Repairing the first Great Forge is a major milestone in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, unlocking some crucial recipes for progression. Upon discovering the forge, a few recipes are also granted to craft the pieces that are currently missing, which can make it seem like that&#39;s the only course of action to fix it. Poking around in the nearby shadows, however, will reveal the necessary parts lying around. Crafting replacement gears and similar items can be relevant later on, but there&#39;s no need to do it this early and lug parts back from camp.

 5  Making Leather 
        

One key component that starts to become essential for upgrades is leather, which would seem like an obvious progression from the hide scraps and hide that are available. The lack of tools like drums or frames, however, can make the process mystifying. The necessary construction to make leather is actually the loom, a choice that tosses logic aside, presumably in the name of streamlining. Building a loom requires Ubasam wood, which won&#39;t be found until delving past 300 fathoms.
Hide can also be crafted from Hide Scraps with a loom, although this requires the use of resin as well. 






 4  Restoring Health With Snacks 
        

Keeping hunger at bay while wandering around in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria isn&#39;t particularly hard, as basic food items can be used for casual munching. This won&#39;t help with health, however, so wandering into an effect that saps HP can very easily be the end of a Dwarf on a mission. Making the oven is the solution to this, as the cooked snacks that it adds to the roster skip the dinner table altogether to be taken on the go. These baked goods will restore health when consumed, making them indispensable in more challenging sections.





 3  Expanding Inventory Size 
        

It&#39;s fairly obvious that the starting pack in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria isn&#39;t going to suffice for the whole game, but figuring out how to upgrade it may not be as clear. Building a workbench as soon as possible is the key to expanding inventory, which requires 15 Elven wood to construct. It can take a bit of exploration to get to the first area with Elven wood, making it easy to forget about building a workbench in the meantime but moving up to a much more appealing 25 slots of inventory space is definitely worth it.

 2  Moving Items In Smaller Groups 
        

The systems for transferring items in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria can sometimes feel limiting, as the only apparent options are grabbing a full stack or going piece by piece. Selecting in singles still allows for multiple to be grabbed before moving an item out of an inventory or a chest, but it can be a bit slow for splitting a stack or tossing some supplies to a fellow Dwarf. Pressing shift before clicking the left mouse button again, however, will switch to stacks of five, a useful feature that isn&#39;t clarified in the UI.





 1  Buffing Energy 


 







It&#39;s good to keep an eye out for Fallen Allies in Moria, as kneeling at these locations can provide a temporary buff. The real treasure, however, comes from the Hero&#39;s Tokens they drop, which can be used to craft a Memorial Flame to set up at camp. There&#39;s no limit to how many times a Dwarf can pray at a Memorial Flame to receive a temporary boost to energy, and doing so before setting out each morning is a healthy habit in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.
