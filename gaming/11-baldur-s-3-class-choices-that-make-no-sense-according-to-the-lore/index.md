## SUMMARY 


Baldur&#39;s Gate 3
 has a number of companions whose personalities and backstories are tied to their class. 
 These classes can be changed any time by visiting Withers in camp.

## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gives players to option to respec any of the playable characters, but some choices work better than other when considering their lore.




Within Baldur’s Gate 3 there is the option to repec any of the playable characters just by talking to Withers. This allows any of the Origin characters or companions to have their class changed for completely custom party configurations. However, just because a character can have their class changed doesn’t mean that class should be changed.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
All of the Baldur’s Gate 3 companions and Origin characters&#39; classes are linked to their backstories, meaning that some changes to their classes might not make the most sense. However, for a small fee, any of the playable characters can have their class completely changed simply by speaking to the camp’s resident undead, Withers. While that freedom is a good thing, allowing anyone to create a party catered to their needs, there are some character and class combinations that simply don’t make sense when it comes to the lore.
            
 
 How To Respec &amp; Change Class In Baldur’s Gate 3

 11  Jaheira As A Bard 
Default Class: Druid
        

Jaheira is a returning character and companion to the series, having appeared in both Baldur&#39;s Gate and Baldur&#39;s Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. Jaheira is a very headstrong druid whose backstory and beliefs focus on protecting nature. Because Jaheira believes that a person needs to have an active role in the world to make a difference, the class that makes the least sense is a College of Lore bard. Classically, these bards wow their patrons with stories, with a focus on entertainment. While the class would work mechanically in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, it makes no sense for Jaheira to be a class that typically focuses on entertainment and collecting tales rather than action.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.








 10  Shadowheart As A Warlock 
Default Class: Cleric


 







Shadowheart&#39;s backstory and personal BG3 questline is interwoven with Shar and Selûne, where she can either become one of Shar&#39;s most loyal Dark Justiciars or learn the truth about her parents and turn to Selûne. Because of this, one of the choices that would make the least sense would be to make Shadowheart an Archfey Warlock. Firstly, having a being other than Shar or Selûne being responsible for her abilities would make no sense, but Archfey are often whimsical beings, clearly at odds with Shadowheart&#39;s more pragmatic personality.





 9  Lae’zel As A Wizard 
Default Class: Fighter
        

As a proud githyanki warrior, Lae&#39;zel prefers action to words and is able to use multiple weapons to devastating effect. Her current class as a fighter reflects this, as whatever weapons the party has to hand Lae&#39;zel can use to defeat her foes in BG3. As such, choosing to make her a more magical class, such as a wizard, doesn&#39;t fit with her personality, background, and goal of becoming a Kith&#39;rak. The worst choice would be an illusion wizard, as that subclass has a focus on trickery and is a little too passive for Lae&#39;zel.

 8  Minsc As A Wizard 
Default Class: Ranger
        

Another companion that would be ill-suited to being a wizard would be Minsc, but for completely different reasons. Returning with Jaheira to Baldur’s Gate 3, Minsc is a fan favorite due in no small part to his dim-witted but good-natured attitude to life. Minsc is a skilled warrior capable of using his weapons to do the talking, so choosing a spellcaster class for him makes little sense. Wizard would be an especially poor (or hilarious) choice due to Minsc&#39;s low intelligence, particularly necromancy. There is no way the Rashemen ranger would ever raise the dead to kick evil&#39;s butt when it was something he and Boo could do alone.





 7  Wyll As A Sorcerer 
Default Class: Warlock
        

Wyll&#39;s backstory and personal quest focuses on his relationship with his warlock patron Mizora. Throughout the course of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Wyll will reveal that he took the deal with Mizora to stop some Tiamat cultists, indicating that he felt he had no other way of stopping them and therefore helping people. Because of this, it wouldn&#39;t make sense for Wyll to be a sorcerer with innate magical powers, as if that was the case, he wouldn&#39;t have needed Mizora. In particular, Wyll being a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer makes the least sense because they tend to be a little hardier and Wyll would have known of his ancestry from an early age.





 6  Minthara As A Druid 
Default Class: Paladin
        

An often overlooked Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 companion, Minthara can only be recruited by turning on the Druid Grove in Act 1. Minthara is a paladin, dedicated to Lolth, and as a drow, views another race as inferior. Because of this, making her a druid makes no sense, as druids seek to live in harmony with nature, animals and others. As a Lolth-Sworn drow who has lived in the Underdark her entire life, it would make no sense for Minthara to be a druid, in particular a Circle of the Moon druid, due in no small part to the link with the drow goddess Eilistraee, who linked with the moon and is the sworn enemy of Lolth.





 5  Halsin As A Rogue 
Default Class: Druid
        

As a druid, Halsin has dedicated his life to protecting and serving nature, something he will happily talk about in camp in BG3. When talking to Halsin in Act 3, he shares his dislike for cities and built-up areas, as they make him feel out of place, and he dislikes how busy they are. Because of this, making Halsin a Thief rogue would make the least sense, as his natural instinct would be to share rather than steal and thieves tend to operate in urban environments.





 4  The Dark Urge As A Cleric 
No Default Class
        

The Dark Urge is a strange mix of custom character and Origin, where they can be any class or race but have a fixed backstory. Although the Dark Urge starts Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 with no memory of who they are, it is revealed throughout the game that they are a Bhaalspawn and originally one of the three Chosen who came up with the Absolute plan with Gortash. Due to their link with Bhaal, the god of murder, it makes little sense to have the Dark Urge be a Light domain cleric. Light clerics follow gods such as Lathander and Helm, good-aligned deities who expect their worshipers to seek out injustice and dispel the darkness in the world.

 3  Karlach As A Warlock 
Default Class: Barbarian


 







Karlach grew up in Baldur&#39;s Gate and served Gortash until he sold her to the Archdevil Zariel. Karlach was forced to fight in the Blood War in Avernus until she was able to get free by hitching a ride on a passing mind flayer ship. To say Karlach has a dislike for devils is an understatement, and she knows that all of Zariel&#39;s fiendish forces will be looking for her. As such, it makes absolutely no sense to make Karlach a warlock with a fiend patron in BG3, as it flies in the face of everything Karlach hates.





 2  Astarion As A Cleric 
Default Class: Rogue
        

Astarion is the charming and sarcastic vampire of the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 party, always ready with his wit to make a comment on every situation the group faces. As a creature of the night, Astarion works well as a rogue, able to stalk through the dark to attack his prey. However, making Astarion a Life cleric is completely illogical, although potentially amusing, as Life Domain clerics focus on preserving and protecting life rather than taking it. The idea of a vampire as the party&#39;s healer might be funny, but Astarion&#39;s temperament really doesn&#39;t mix well with the role of the classic healer.





 1  Gale As A Barbarian 
Default Class: Wizard


 







Gale is a character who takes pride in his intelligence and his magical talents. His entire backstory and quest is wrapped up in his desire to impress the goddess Mystra enough that she will take him back as her lover. Therefore, making Gale a Berserker barbarian doesn&#39;t make any sense as it robs him of his talents, something that he&#39;s had since he was a child. While the idea of Gale raging and frenzy throwing enemies around the battlefield is hilarious and tempting, it also flies in the face of his established lore in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
