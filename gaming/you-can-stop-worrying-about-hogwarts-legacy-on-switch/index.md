## Literature Review

After many delays, Hogwarts Legacy is coming to the Nintendo Switch console soon, and despite many worries, there’s reason to believe it will be good.




Hogwarts Legacy is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch after numerous delays caused by difficulties in porting the massive and graphically intense RPG to the technologically outdated Switch console. Though set in the Harry Potter universe, the game takes place a century before Harry&#39;s birth and lets players experience what it is like to be a wizard in an open-world environment. Since its initial release in February 2023, Hogwarts Legacy has been slowly released on all the major gaming platforms available today, with the Nintendo Switch being the last to join that list.




The limitations of the Nintendo Switch have made many doubt the quality and performance that a game such as Hogwarts Legacy could have on the console. Rumors are constantly circulating about a new Nintendo console that is supposedly in development, as the Switch is now well past its lifespan, and many games cannot run on the system. Despite the challenge, developers for Hogwarts Legacy have been assuring the community for months that they are doing all they can to make the Nintendo version of the game the best it can be, and early leaks are suggesting that they may have succeeded.

Some people who acquired early physical copies of the game have recently attempted to leak footage showing Hogwarts Legacy running on the Nintendo Switch, but the videos were quickly taken down. The brief glimpses these gave were promising, however, and showed that although it isn&#39;t quite as impressive looking as the game can be on other platforms, it was remarkable for a console the age of the Switch. According to these early videos, the performance seems stable, and although some noticeable adaptations were made to the graphics, it is promising. Unlike the failure that was MK1 on the Switch, it looks like Hogwarts Legacy may be taking a better approach.

                  Hogwarts Legacy Switch Release Can Be Fixed With One Simple Change   With the lengthy delay between the original release of Hogwarts Legacy and its launch on the Nintendo Switch, developers need to make it special.    



 Previous Delays In The Nintendo Switch Release May Have Been Worth It 
Releasing November 18, 2023
          




Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch has suffered numerous delays and is now finally being released over nine months after the game was initially launched for other systems. These delays could hurt the game&#39;s sales on this console, particularly as much of the hype for the game has since quieted down, and many who wanted to play it have gone to other sources. However, it is still good for developers to take the time they need to make a quality product, and it appears that is exactly what happened here, as reports suggest that the Switch version of the game could be much better than anyone expected.

Any time a developer needs to delay the release of a game may hurt the company financially, but it ultimately provides the best results for the gaming community and quality products. Sales for Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch may not compare to those of the PS5 or other systems, but it will still sell, particularly with the holiday season approaching. These early leaked reports of the surprisingly impressive quality of Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch are encouraging.
