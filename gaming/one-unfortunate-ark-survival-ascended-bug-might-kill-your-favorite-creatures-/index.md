## Literature Review

One bug persists in Ark: Survival Ascended, causing massive issues for people looking to transport certain dinos quickly. Here&#39;s how to avoid it. 




In Ark: Survival Ascended, one bug is causing a high level of frustration among players, and it&#39;s an issue that may end up killing everyone&#39;s favorite creatures and dinosaurs. Anyone who has ever played any iteration of Ark knows that sometimes the game can be rough around the edges, but this bug is a huge one that hasn&#39;t been fixed in over a month, causing a ton of frustration for certain players.




Taming the coolest dinosaurs and creatures is central to Ark: Survival Ascended. That said, finding the best creatures is easier said than done, and sometimes, the taming process can take a lot of grinding for the proper gear, so having creatures randomly die can be a huge problem. Worse yet, this bug can wipe out hours of progress. Luckily, it&#39;s pretty easy to avoid, and there are even a few workarounds for now.

                  10 Biggest Differences Between Ark: Survival Ascended &amp; Survival Evolved   Ark: Survival Ascended is a graphical revamp of Survival Evolved using UE5, but questions of what else has changed are worth exploring.    


 Fast Traveling In Singleplayer ASA May Kill All Your Water Tames 
         

Many users, including u/NerdEternal on Reddit, have experienced a bug in which fast traveling in singleplayer ASA kills all their water tames. What makes this situation even worse is that many of the creatures were high-level 200&#43;, meaning that the user wasted a ton of time taming and then leveling up their mighty water beasts.




                  10 Best Upcoming New Features In Ark: Survival Ascended   Ark: Survival Ascended will slowly start to incorporate all the content from Evolved, but Studio Wildcard plans on taking things even further.    

Sadly, this doesn&#39;t seem like an isolated incident, with many others pointing to the fact that fast traveling in singleplayer Ark: Survival Ascended runs the potential of killing tamed water creatures. Other Ark players have claimed that teleporting via the Tek Teleporter is another way to quickly wipe out water creatures people have tamed and raised.



This bug seems to largely only affect singleplayer at the moment, though there have been reports of similar bugs on unofficial servers.






 Why Does Fast Traveling Kill Water Tames In ASA? 
          




Though unconfirmed, many in the community have their theories as to why this unfortunate Ark bug exists. The most realistic theory is tied to how the game renders water and the high level of vulnerability water creatures have when outside of water. According to some, they believe that the game renders water after it renders dinosaurs and creatures, meaning that the hapless water dinosaurs are left out on the land for a period of time, bringing a short end to their lives. This would make sense, considering that teleporting via the Tek Teleporter or fast traveling via the Bed seems to have the same effect.



 Fast-Travel Bug Fix &amp; Solution For Ark: Survival Ascended 
          

There are two main ways to avoid the fast-travel water creature-killing bug. The first way is to avoid fast traveling altogether, which is unlikely to be the most convenient solution for people who need to use the mechanic. One solid solution is to freeze any water tames in a Cryopod before fast traveling, ensuring they don&#39;t die on transport. Luckily, Cryopods were recently re-introduced into the game, making this possible.




                  Ark: Survival Ascended DLC Roadmap - All Planned Expansions &amp; Updates   Ark: Survival Ascended is a remastered Survival Evolved in Unreal Engine 5, and is expected to gradually include all of the originalâ€™s DLC expansions.   

Though the fast-travel bug in singleplayer Ark: Survival Ascended is frustrating, those who take the time to store their water dinos in pods before traveling, or just forego using fast travel altogether, can avoid the bothersome bug. Hopefully, Studio Wildcard will create a patch for the issue soon, as it makes the mechanic way less desirable to use.
