## Literature Review

A Very Rare weapon called the Sword of Chaos is a magic item you can get in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 if you choose to challenge an intimidating force of evil.





Since the Sword of Chaos is classified as a Greatsword, only characters who have proficiency with martial weapons can reliably use this item. Make sure to check someone&#39;s class features if you are wondering if they can use the Sword or not. The best companions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 who might be the most qualified to wield the sword might be Karlach or Lae&#39;Zel if your custom character is designed for something other than close combat.




  


 Where To Find The Sword of Chaos 
          

The Sword of Chaos can be found in Act 3 as loot from killing Sarevok of the Bhaalist Murder Tribunal within the Lower City. Solving the Open Hand Temple murders will lead you to discover a group of cultists worshiping Bhall, the god of murder, underneath the city. The side quest related to the murders in Baldur&#39;s Gate will reveal certain culprits tied to this hidden society of killers.

Pursuing enough clues should lead you to Candulhallow&#39;s Tombstones or an area near Elfsong Tavern on your Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 map. Evidence found from the Open Hand temple murders will let your party use a specific password to enter the cult&#39;s lair below the city through a secret passage. From here, you will meet the NPC Sarevok or the leader of the Bhaal cultists, who have been causing so much terror.




While you can make decisions that convince the cult you are on their side, the Sword of Chaos is Sarevok&#39;s and Sarevok&#39;s alone unless you kill him. This enemy is surrounded by allies, so you should engage in some Deception until you can get close enough to assassinate the leader. On the other hand, your party could just engage in combat immediately to kill Sarevok and his followers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.



Like many other choices, killing Sarevok and his cultists of Bhaal will lock you out from other items, including the Bhaalist armor set in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that would be sold by a secret vendor in the Tribunal.






 How To Kill Sarevok 
          

Sarevok is a Level 16 Fighter and a legendary Bhaalspawn from past Baldur&#39;s Gate titles, making him one of the most powerful foes your party can challenge. Refusing to become an Unholy Assassin of Bhaal immediately starts a fight with this figure, but killing him is another matter entirely. Sarevok has an Armor Class of 20 and 262 Hit Points and many other abilities.




The most dangerous part of Sarevok is how they have Absorbed Essences of other people, from sacrifices to Bhaal that grant different powers. One such Essence makes Sarevok permanently Hastened, meaning they essentially have two turns in combat every time they act in a round. He also cannot be Paralyzed, Restrained, or have movement speed reduced with this ability in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.



Sarevok already has Extra Attack, which allows them to perform two melee weapon attacks with a normal Attack action. Being Hastened will enable him to make four strikes before you can even think about your turn in battle. Sarevok&#39;s First Blood ability lets them deal Bleeding damage to a target with full health.




Sarevok&#39;s attacks heal him as if dealing damage to his enormous health pool wasn&#39;t already hard enough. Sarevok can also raise his AC to 26 if he activates the Absorbed Essence of Amelyssan, which makes him extremely difficult to hit. Sarevok&#39;s final Essence effect in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 could allow him to regain 2-24 Hit Points on successful attacks against any members of your party.




The best way to approach this combat is to focus on trapping Sarevok and prevent them from acting on their turn. Spells like Hold Person are incredibly useful here, or any ability that Stuns Sarevok in any way. Sarevok is particularly weak to any ability that forces a Wisdom or Charisma-based Saving Throw. However, remember that his Legendary Resistance and Indomitable features give him a better chance to succeed.

                  All Legendary Weapons In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Ranked   There are 13 legendary weapons to be found in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here&#39;s how each weapon holds up in-game.   



 How To Defeat The Murder Tribunal 

 

Even if your party has a plan to deal with Sarevok, you have to be prepared to face his fellow cultists as they come to defend their leader. Some of the followers of Bhaal will cast Sanctuary on Sarevok, which makes the boss practically invulnerable for a short time. One member of your party should focus on taking out these allies as quickly as possible throughout the fight in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.




                  7 Best Melee Weapons In Baldur’s Gate 3   Melee weapons are the backbone of Baldur’s Gate 3 combat. Frontliners can wield heavy weapons, while even sneaky characters will want a light blade.   

There are plenty of enemies to deal with, but YouTube creator Trophygamers shows off some strategies in their video above that might inspire a strategy for you to take down this cult. Certain Area of Effect (AoE) spells can take down multiple targets before they even act to get rid of Sarevok&#39;s support network. If you aren&#39;t confident in your party&#39;s success, you can always save scum and try again by reloading the game.



 How To Use The Sword of Chaos 
          

The Sword of Chaos is a &#43;2 Magic Greatsword that deals 2d6 slashing damage in addition to a character&#39;s Strength modifier. The enchantment on this blade also causes it to inflict 1d4 Necrotic damage. The Chaos ability this magic item possesses allows the wielder to regain 1d6 Hit Points whenever they hit a target with the Sword during any combat situation.




The weapon actions for this sword are the same as any other greatsword in the game and give you more flexibility in battle than you might expect. If you have no use for this item, you can sell it for 960 Gold to the nearest vendor.

However, those who manage to get the Sword of Chaos from Sarevok in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 might find that this weapon pairs best with the other loot the boss drops.
