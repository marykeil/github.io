## Literature Review

Every weapon in Hades has four different aspects players can unlock, but the fourth aspect of each has specific requirements Zagreus must complete.





It is worth pointing out that unlocking all 24 weapons can be difficult, and you may not use different strategies/tactics to unlock every aspect. You will need to meet specific requirements to unlock each aspect, and some of them are quite challenging to acquire. Once you have unlocked every weapon in Hades using Chthonic Keys and have collected at least one Titan Blood, the aspects become available to be unlocked on the next run. While most weapon aspects in Hades can be unlocked with Titan Blood, each weapon also has a fourth aspect which can only be used once a series of requirements are met.




                  Hades: How to Get Titan Blood   Titan Blood allows players to add permanent upgrades to their weapons in Hades. This guide will show players how they can obtain it in-game.   


 Hidden Aspect Requirements in Hades 
          

The following must be completed to unlock a weapon&#39;s hidden aspect in Hades:
