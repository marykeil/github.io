 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
December 7th #901
          




The December 7th Wordle answer is SLEEP.

Nothing too difficult for today, for our starting Wordle word we used POUND. This only provided a single &#39;P&#39; in the wrong position and a chunk of incorrect letters. Moving forward we tried CHAPS as our second attempt which helped add another incorrect letter with &#39;S&#39;.

Moving the two letters around we tried SPERM as our third guess and locked in the &#39;S&#39; as well as a new vowel &#39;E&#39;. This also provided the only possible location for the &#39;P&#39; to go so assuming they used a double-&#39;E&#39; we tried STEEP as our fourth guess. This proved us correct with the double-letter and set us up for an easy Wordle win-in-five with the correct answer, SLEEP.
