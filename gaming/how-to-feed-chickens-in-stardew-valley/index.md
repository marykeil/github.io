## Literature Review

In Stardew Valley, players need to feed their chickens hay, which can be bought or harvested from grass, in order for them to grow and produce eggs.





To get started with raising chickens, you must first build a Coop that can house up to four chickens. You can purchase the farm building from Robin for 4,000 gold, 100 stone, and 300 wood. Once the coop is built, you can purchase a chicken from Marnie for 800 gold. You can also purchase other animals in Stardew Valley from her if you wish to raise more. Once you have purchased the chicken, it will mature in 3 days and then have the ability to produce eggs. However, to grow the baby chicken, you must feed them.

 Best Methods For Feeding Chickens In Stardew Valley 
          

Chicken can only be fed Hay in Stardew Valley, which you can purchase from Marnie as well. Alternatively, you can also Cut grass with Scythe to create Hay; however, you need to buy a Silo for your farm first. If your farm does not have a Silo, grass will not be converted into Hay, and you will need to purchase it to raise the Chickens. To feed the Chickens, place the Hay on the bench in the back of the coop, and the birds will consume it on their own. Make sure to always have Hay on this bench so that the Chickens can keep feeding to start making eggs.






It is recommended to construct a Silo on your farm as Grass does not grow in Winter. To ensure you have sufficient Hay, let the grass grow and only cut it on the last day of the season.




To purchase a Silo from Robin, you will need 100 gold, 100 stone, 10 clay, and 5 copper bars. Once you have all the necessary equipment, consider upgrading the Coop to the Deluxe Coop. Upgrading the Coop will automatically transfer Hay from the Silo to the Coop, saving you a lot of time for other tasks, such as catching a Woodkskip Fish in Stardew Valley.

Furthermore, if you let your animals out to graze during the day in Spring, Summer, or Fall, they will eat the grass that is already growing on the farm, if available. This will reduce the amount of Hay that is required to feed the animals and grant a boost in friendship for the animals. To receive the highest quality goods from animals, iridium quality, you will want to maximize your friendship with the animals. To let out your animals, open the small door at the front of the coop or barn. Additionally, the animals will automatically return inside at 5 p.m., and they will stay inside during bad weather and Stardew Valley&#39;s Winter season.
