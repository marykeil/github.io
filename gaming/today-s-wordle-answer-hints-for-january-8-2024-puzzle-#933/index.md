Monday Wordle is ready to be solved and today&#39;s answer shouldn&#39;t be too much trouble. Here are the daily hints and answer to today&#39;s Wordle.





There are still plenty of words that Wordle hasn&#39;t used yet so the game has a long life before the need to repeat any answers. Keeping track of each of the past answers is a good way to help solve future games since they have yet to repeat a single word.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
January 8th #933
          




The January 8th Wordle word is FINAL.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE. This gave us both vowels right away, the only issue was they were in the wrong positions. Mixing them around a bit we tried PAINS as our second guess, this added a few more incorrect locations for the vowels as well as a misplaced &#39;N&#39;.

Moving forward, our third guess was NINJA which locked in the &#39;I&#39; and the &#39;N&#39; and provided only a few places for the &#39;A&#39; to go. This was a quick jump to the correct answer, and our Wordle win-in-four, with FINAL.
