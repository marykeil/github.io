## Literature Review

There are romance options for everyone, and there are some particularly good choices for players who play as Dark Urge in Baldur’s Gate 3.




The best romance options for a Dark Urge (Durge) playthrough in Baldur’s Gate 3 are those that match the main character’s evil and bloodthirsty impulses. Dark Urge is an origin that players can choose when building their character. By choosing Dark Urge in Baldur’s Gate 3, they unlock a series of different events that can occur throughout the campaign, mostly motivated by some savage impulses that often lead to bloody deaths. The Durge even has a special questline of its own, allowing players to better understand where these impulses come from, and the ending can vary according to the choices made along the way.
This article contains a few spoilers for Baldur’s Gate 3.
A great example of this unique origin is that an uncontrollable Dark Urge kill in Baldur’s Gate 3 kills off the gentle bard Alfira, even if the Emerald Grove is saved from the grasps of the Absolutists led by Minthara at the Goblin Camp. Even Gale can be killed off early, with the Dark Urge seeing the wizard’s hand chopped off when asking for help to leave a portal. In all of its essence, the Dark Urge is an evil-aligned origin story for a playthrough. Luckily, this does not block them out from having memorable romantic escapades, as there are some pretty evil characters to get involved with.
            
 
 10 Most Disturbing Dark Urge Choices In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
Playing as the Dark Urge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 means players will have to make a lot more life and death decisions, some of which have gruesome outcomes.












 








 5  Haarlep 
The Incubus At Raphael’s House Of Hope Can Be A Fling
        

One of the one-time romance partners in Baldur’s Gate 3, Haarlep is found late in the game, well into Act 3. This incubus resides in Raphael’s House of Hope and its male form can even take on the cambion’s physical appearance. Haarlep also has a female Archduchess form. Regardless of who they resemble, Haarlep is a great romance option for a Dark Urge playthough, because it is in line with the origin character’s impulses into primal and evil nature. The fact that most companions disapprove of the main character getting involved with Haarlep speaks volumes to the fact that this is wrong.
Yet, doing the wrong thing with Dark Urge is often the correct thing. This is an optimal choice, especially if players are diving into the roleplaying aspect of Baldur’s Gate 3. It is a one-time circumstance and will not actually evolve, but can significantly add to character-building. If players want to take it a step further, they can get romantically involved with Haarlep and then kill them, in a full demonstration of why Durge is such a vile origin to play with. If Haarlep is not killed, then they will make the character feel pleasure at very awkward moments – which, again, may be in line with an evil playthrough.





 4  Mizora 
Wyll’s Patron Can Feel Particularly Grateful
        

As a cambion, Mizora is an evil being. She may be somewhat polite and easy to talk to, but her intentions are vile – and the Dark Urge can get involved with her, even if only for a single night. Players will have to do some good deeds along the way, such as saving Mizora in Baldur’s Gate 3 from death in the Mind Flayer Colony. Later, in Act 3, she will feel especially grateful for the main character’s actions and offers a special night of pleasure. The issue is that the cost of it is the burning of thousands of souls all across the Hells.
If a Dark Urge character does not particularly mind the eternal suffering of others’ souls, then this is a great way of spending a night like no other. Romancing Mizora perfectly fits Durge’s vile needs and connects them to one of the most evil characters in the game. This morally objectionable decision in Baldur’s Gate 3 may affect some existing romances, such as that with Lae’zel, but the Dark Urge should not really care about a possible breakup and their companions’ feelings if they are truly that evil and invested in fulfilling their own desires.





 3  Astarion (Ascended) 
Become A Spawn To A Power-Mad Vampire
        

Astarion already has a questionable sense of morality in the game, but if players allow him to complete the ritual initiated by Cazador in Baldur’s Gate 3 and ascend as a vampire lord, then things get very dark, very quickly. That does, however, match everything a Dark Urge playthough. Astarion gets drunk on his newfound power and sees everything, including his romantic partner, the player, as a pawn. He will continue the cycle of violence and abuse under which he suffered so direly. However, giving Astarion the power to be a villain and accepting his protection is perfect for a Durge playthrough.
As Dark Urge, seeing their carefully cultivated partner become even more like them, imbued in bloodthirsty power, makes for a perfect match. There will be a continuous struggle showing lovers to enemies and back to lovers again, as weirdly violent impulses drive both parties, but it can be a spectacle to witness. Even if morally corrupt and villainous, Ascended Astarion is one of the most interesting storylines in Baldur’s Gate 3 and, luckily, it fits the roleplaying aspect of players who choose Dark Urge as their origin.





 2  Shadowheart (Dark Justiciar) 
Help Shadowheart Obey Shar &amp; Reap The Rewards


 







Directing Shadowheart to give in to her faith and kill the Nightsong at Shar’s behest is an evil action, as the goddess is evil herself. Shadowheart knows that is the morally wrong thing to do and, yet, does it. This cathartic moment utterly changes her and most signs of kindness and fondness are replaced by a cold and selfish demeanor, which is perfect for a Dark Urge playthough. Romancing Shadowheart in Baldur’s Gate 3 can go in many different directions and even if making her forfeit Shar results in the most heartwarming experience, turning Shadowheart bad pays off in equal measure.
When Shadowheart spares Dame Aylin, the romance with her is heartfelt, and players share moments of tenderness under the moonlight. However, if she remains devoted to Shar and gives in to her evil self in Baldur’s Gate 3, the romance scene goes quite differently. Shadowheart besmirches a statue of Selûne with the blood of the goddess’ daughter, Dame Alyin, and then has a fierce night of pleasures with the player in front of that very statue. A Dark Urge character could not want anything more, as blood and primal instincts walk hand-in-hand with the origin.





 1  Minthara 
Romancing The Drow As Dark Urge Unlocks A Special Scene
        

Minthara is the best romance option for an evil playthrough in Baldur’s Gate 3, and the most fitting for those playing as Dark Urge. The drow is a vile character that, despite being controlled by the Absolute, claims for the death of (mostly) peaceful druids and tiefling refugees trying to survive. As the Durge, siding with her is perfect. After helping Minthara accomplish her bloody deeds in Act 1, eventually, players may celebrate with her.
She will feel grateful and attracted to the player&#39;s character and have one of the most intense romance scenes in the entire game. After that, Minthara will appear laying her head on the player’s chest. This is when the Dark Urge unlocks a special choice – they may opt to snap her neck and officially kill her off. It will end the romance as Minthara will be dead, but it does live up to the Dark Urge’s needs and reputation in Baldur’s Gate 3.
