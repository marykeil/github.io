## Literature Review

Finding the right PC strategy game in a sea of options can be difficult. These superb titles will make narrowing things down a lot easier. 




There&#39;s just something special about the hectic nature of real-time strategy games like StarCraft 2 or the high level of tactics required to win a grand strategy game like Crusader Kings 3 that other video game genres can&#39;t replicate. Highly cerebral, PC strategy games span various genres, some of which can require split-second reactions while others are more of a slow burn.

Ultimately, choosing the title to invest time into will come down to personal preference and what the one is trying to get out of the experience. Luckily, there are plenty of games — some of which have been released in just the past few years — that are good enough to scratch that strategy-game itch for just about any person.

 10  Company of Heroes 3 (2023) 
Real-Time Strategy
        

Though the initial reception for COH3 was not great, it builds upon a solid franchise of real-time strategy games set during World War 2. Players must build a base and field units &amp; armored vehicles to overtake the enemy. With both co-op and PvP game modes and win conditions that include capturing more points or completely destroying the enemy, the game has plenty of variety. In addition, the title boasts pretty decent cover and retreat mechanics; the game is a fun example of how to do a realistic war RTS.
            
 
 “World War 2 On Both A Minute &amp; Grand Scale” - Company Of Heroes 3 Console Edition Review 
Relic Entertainment makes an admirable effort at bringing Company of Heroes 3 to console, but the platform’s shortcomings are apparent for RTS games.



As a warning, however — the game has also had its fair share of criticism, with many pointing towards the fact that it seemingly re-uses assets from previous titles and has a poor approach to how it releases new content, with aggressive monetization being the primary issue. These complaints aren&#39;t without merit, and realistically, those on a budget can pick up the more affordable Company of Heroes 2 for a pretty similar, albeit very fun, experience.





 9  Jagged Alliance 3 (2023) 
Turn-Based Tactics
        

Jagged Alliance 3 sees the franchise return after a 24-year hiatus from the previous title in the series, which debuted all the way back in 1999. The title is a turn-based tactics game akin to the X-COM series of games where players must form a team to take on different missions across the fictional country of Grand Chein. Using a large overworld map with dozens of different zones, the squad must wrestle squares of territory held by the Legion, a paramilitary organization in the region.

Jagged Alliance 3 offers a strategically deep tactical experience where players will hire mercenaries to save a country from paramilitary control.



The combat system in Jagged Alliance 3 is fun and intuitive, with things like cover and high ground giving the edge to a diverse array of characters that can be recruited. There&#39;s a fairly sizeable arsenal of weaponry, and each character has unique attributes that make them play differently on the battlefield. Where the game diverges from other turn-based strategy games is with the unique overworld map, with different points of interest that need to be handled by different squadrons that people can field. It is much like Risk, the board game, but with a lot more humor, good voice acting, and vivid environments.





 8  Age of Empires 4: Anniversary Edition (2021) 
Real-Time Strategy
        

  Age of Empires 4  


  Platform(s)    PC     Released    October 28, 2021     Developer(s)    Relic Entertainment     Publisher(s)    Xbox Game Studios    


The Age of Empires franchise is one of the most iconic real-time strategy games ever made. Distributed by Microsoft and Xbox, many different studios have had a hand in its creation over the years. The most recent entry, Age of Empires 4: Anniversary Edition, is developed by Relic Entertainment and is still seeing updates, with the most recent seasonal AOE 4 update introducing three new maps and a host of bug fixes and new content, including The Sultans Ascend expansion, which added the Byzantines and Japanese to the game.
Though some were left feeling somewhat underwhelmed by the streamlined nature and limited eight-factions in the game — arguing that perhaps previous entries were stronger games — Age of Empires 4 is still a fun, classic experience that will feel very similar to past entries in the franchise.





 7  Age Of Wonders 4 (2023) 
Turn-Based, 4X
        

  Age Of Wonders 4  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    May 2, 2023     Developer(s)    Triumph Studios     Publisher(s)    Paradox Interactive    


For those seeking out a new 4X game, then Paradox&#39;s latest entry in their AOW franchise, Age of Wonders 4, may be the game to get. Set in a high-fantasy realm, Age of Wonders 4 combines elements of the 4X game genre, which stands for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate while boasting a turn-based combat system. Unlike other 4X games where units attack each other with RNG and stats determining the winner, Age of Wonders 4 enters a turn-based combat mode, which requires correct positioning and tactics to win.

 6  Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns (2022) 
Turn-Based Tactics


 







  Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns  


  Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , Steam , Epic Games Store     Released    December 2, 2022     Developer(s)    Fireaxis Games     Publisher(s)    2K Games    


Developed by Firaxis Games, the same company responsible for the XCOM and Civilization titles, Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns is an innovative take on the typical turn-based tactics game. The game does this by incorporating elements found in card game roguelikes, where each card represents a different ability. In addition to RPG elements, those who enjoy the Marvel universe will even further appreciate this solid title.

 5  Europa Universalis 4 (2013) 
Grand Strategy
        

Though the dense nature of gameplay in Europa Universalis 4 may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, others who love realistic geo-political intrigue and civilization management may fall in love with this grand strategy title. What the game lacks is the quick-paced combat of real-time strategy titles; it makes up for the intricacies and mechanics of town management. In EU4, people take control of a fledgling European country from the 1400s to the 1800s and must manage tense relationships with other nations while balancing an economy and populace.





 4  Civilization 6 (2016) 
Turn-Based, 4X
        

  Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization 6  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PC , Xbox One     Released    October 21, 2016     Developer(s)    Firaxis Games     Publisher(s)    2K Games , Aspyr    


Arguably the most well-known 4X franchise in existence today, Civilization 6 is the latest entry in a long line of iconic turn-based 4X games. In the game, people take control of a civilization and develop it throughout different eras. Games can be won via warfare or diplomacy, though the combat mechanics in the game are similar to other 4X games, where stats and a roll of the dice typically determine the outcome in battle. Though the turn-based nature of the game can make it a bit slower than other 4X games at times, it&#39;s still considered one of the best 4X games ever made, and can also be enjoyed with up to three other players online.





 3  Crusader Kings 3 (2020) 
Grand Strategy


 







  Crusader Kings 3  


  Platform(s)    Xbox Series X , PC , PlayStation 5     Released    September 1, 2020     Developer(s)    Paradox Development Studio     Publisher(s)    Paradox Interactive    


For those who love grand strategy and are looking for a title packed with interesting political intrigue, Crusader Kings 3 is arguably the best modern iteration of the genre that people can get. Taking control of a noble house and building it while expanding territory and influence, the game delves into complex situations and issues that come with leading a nation. With dynamic and interesting scenarios set on the vast European lands, the game has been praised for its intricate mechanics and sometimes humorous random situations that one can sometimes find themselves in.





 2  StarCraft 2: Legacy Of The Void (2015) 
Real-Time Strategy
        

The standalone expansion for 2010&#39;s StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty continues the story where the last game takes off, but most importantly, it brings huge changes to the multiplayer portion of the game by modifying resource gathering and construction mechanics. Arguably, the best iteration of StarCraft is Legacy of the Void, which combined everything learned from the previous StarCraft games and merged it into a finished work that stands the test of time even today.

 1  Total War: Warhammer 3 (2022) 
Grand Strategy, Turn-Based Tactics, Real-Time Strategy


 







The Total War series of games has combined the best elements from some of the top strategy games in the genre and melded them together for a seamless video game experience. Total War: Warhammer 3 is arguably Creative Assembly&#39;s masterwork, with three games in the franchise combined into one for a massive world map set in the Warhammer universe. While it does require all three games to get the full experience of the grand campaign, it&#39;s one worth experiencing for the replay value and variety of different playable factions, all of which have unique mechanics and units.
            
 
 Total War: Warhammer 3: Champions of Chaos DLC (Tips, Units, &amp; Legendary Lords) 
Total War: Warhammer 3&#39;s Champions of Chaos DLC brings 49 unique units and four powerful, specialized factions to the Realms of Chaos battlefield.



In Warhammer 3, players take control of a Warhammer faction like the Empire or Dark Elves and expand their territory on a giant overworld map. When armies converge on the map, they enter the real-time strategy component of the game, where huge brigades clash on massive battlefields. Winning in combat requires expert control and mastery over battlefield strategy, while the overworld map provides plenty of grand strategy elements like settlement building, tax regulation, trade, and diplomacy.
Regardless of whether one enjoys the intricate, slow-paced gameplay of grand strategy titles like Crusader Kings 3 or the fast-paced, frenetic energy of real-time strategy games like StarCraft 2, there are luckily many options out there for lovers of the strategy genre.
