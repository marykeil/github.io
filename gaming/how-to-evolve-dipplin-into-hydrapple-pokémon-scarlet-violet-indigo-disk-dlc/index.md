## Literature Review

In order to evolve Dipplin into the new Hydrapple in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you need to follow some steps.





This sister school to Naranja and Uva Academies is located in the Unova region, but in the middle of the ocean. There, you can focus on tough battles in the Terarium but also find the many Pokémon that compose the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC’s Blueberry Pokédex. Some of these creatures are returning from previous Generations, such as the starters and some Legendaries, while others are brand new additions – one of which is Hydrapple, Dipplin’s evolution.




                  One New Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk DLC Was Hiding All Along   It seems like one of the new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk has been hiding in the base games, Scarlet and Violet, for over a year.   


 Teach Dipplin A Move To Evolve Into Hydrapple In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
          

To evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you need to teach the Grass- and Dragon-type creature a special move. This move is called Dragon Cheer. The move was introduced in the Gen 9 games and its main purpose is to increase the user’s allies’ critical hit ratio. According to the move’s in-game description, this effect is stronger for Dragon-type Pokémon. While it can be used in battles, however, its main purpose for collectors rather than competitive players is helping Dipplin evolve.




Teaching Dragon Cheer to Dipplin through TM 226, however, is not enough. Once the Pokémon learns the move, you will need to level it up at least once. Knowing the Dragon Cheer move and leveling up is the key to evolving Dipplin into Hydrapple. Even though Dipplin’s evolution in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC does not change types as was speculated based on rumors and alleged leaks, it is Applin’s first third-form evolution.



Neither Flapple nor Appletun, two of Applin’s evolutions, are able to evolve in the series so far.




Hydrapple is a Grass- and Dragon-type Pokémon, retaining its previous form’s typing. The creature is, essentially, a hydra hidden within an apple. One of the dragon’s heads always sticks out of the caramel-glazed apple, while the other heads rest inside the fruit. However, they do come out during battles, when using moves, and when simply roaring. Hydrapple is one of the several new creatures added to the Gen 9 games through the Indigo Disk DLC. A few other monsters are Archaludon, Raging Bolt, Iron Crown, and the Paradox forms of Entei and Terrakion in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
