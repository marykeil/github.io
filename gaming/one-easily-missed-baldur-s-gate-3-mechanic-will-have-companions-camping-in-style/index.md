## Literature Review

There are many mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are not evidently explained. Here is one that may make your camping sessions more pleasant.




Among the many options it presents, there is an easily missed mechanic in Baldur’s Gate 3 that allows players to have their companions camp in style. The popular CRPG by Larian Studios is full of options, from narrative decisions to gameplay choices and, because of how dense it is in terms of mechanics, a lot of very simple things may go unnoticed, especially if players are focused on getting through the game rather than exploring its many possibilities. An example of this is how players can miss out on several game-breaking exploits in Baldur’s Gate 3, many of which can only be discovered if they experiment around.




Not everything is a secret in the game and, in fact, there are several tricks in Baldur’s Gate 3 that players may miss early on simply due to the fact that they may be overwhelmed by information or certain details are not evidently spelled out. Another example is that players can save Mayrina from her burning cage by throwing a water bottle at it – this seems like a somewhat logical solution in real life, but can even be considered surprising in-game. Among these many small details, there is one that can make camping all the more pleasant, mostly due to its aesthetic value.

  


 You Can (&amp; Should) Change Your Companions’ Camp Outfits In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          




When players camp, they may notice that their companions lay aside their armor and change into a more casual and comfortable outfit at night. What the game does not tell them is that it is possible to alter this casual camp outfit. As such, characters like Gale and Astarion can be prompted to show a bit more skin, while Lae’zel or Karlach can be covered up a bit more. The opposite is also true. There are many different regular clothes that players can pick up while exploring Baldur’s Gate 3 that can be given to their companions or even their own custom characters.

                  10 Characters Worth Saving In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Players of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 face many decisions when it comes to the fate of characters they meet on their adventure, but which ones should be saved?    



 Different Companion Camp Outfits Allow For More Roleplaying In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          




Being able to change the companions’ clothes is an easy way of further deepening the roleplaying experience. If players are aware that they are bound to have a pleasant evening with Shadowheart in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3, for instance, they may equip her with a special and colorful dress and avoid the beautiful yet standard black vest. It is a pity that most of the best clothing pieces are only obtainable near or during Act 3 – it would be great if the early stages of the game had a clothing vendor to further enhance customization options.

Nevertheless, changing the characters’ outfits can give a completely different feeling to interactions with them. In fact, if players want to, they can trigger the camp clothes to be permanently on, as a visual override to the armor they usually wear. Having a fighter like Lae’zel fight in comfortable clothing makes no logical sense, but it is an option for players in Baldur’s Gate 3.
