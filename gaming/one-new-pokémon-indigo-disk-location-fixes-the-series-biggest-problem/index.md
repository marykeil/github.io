## Literature Review

It seems like there will be a major change in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which may even push the franchise forward.




It seems like a new location in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will fix the biggest problem in the series. The second expansion in the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack will conclude the story that was set up by the first set of content, named The Teal Mask. While the first DLC took players to the land of Kitakami for a school trip, Indigo Disk will set players off on an exchange program with Blueberry Academy, a sister school to Naranja and Uva Academies in Paldea, respectively. Blueberry Academy is situated in the Unova region but is in the middle of the ocean.




Although much of the attention will be on the new and returning Pokémon in Indigo Disk, as well as the story presented about the Terastal Phenomenon, there are also clues that indicate that there will be major gameplay improvements with the arrival of the DLC. This is based on a few preview reports from outlets that had access to a trial session of the expansion before its official release later in December. As most previews are, the content explored was limited. Nevertheless, it was enough to give some insight into what players can expect – and how an ancient problem can be fixed.

 Battles May Actually Offer A Challenge In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
          

According to the preview written by Joe Merrick on Serebii, the Terarium area of Blueberry Academy will provide players with challenging battles in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The Trainer levels can vary, starting from Level 60, and most, if not all, encounters with NPCs will result in a Double Battle. Merrick describes this as a “marked change from every main series game to date”, as Double Battles are usually an exception to the rule led by Single Battles. They cite encountering a tough Trainer with a team at Level 70 that “proved a challenge” by using Double Battle strategies.






Some Double Battle strategies include mixing up specific Pokémon with certain abilities to provide support and activate bonuses to one another, for instance.

The new challenge provided by the Indigo Disk does not seem to stem from the big shift to Double Battles themselves but from the various tactics that are made possible by having two active Pokémon on the field. Merrick mentions tactics like “Toxic Orb Toxic Boost Zangoose, double Intimidate strategies, Grassy Seed Whimsicott with Grassy Terrain, and more” being employed by NPCs. Double Battles unlock an additional layer of strategy when building teams and how to pair up creatures in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC. When paired up with the high level of the Pokémon used by the Trainers, this raises the difficulty to a new standard of challenge.




According to Merrick’s preview, some Trainers in the Terarium can be compared to the Kitakami Ogre Clan members in The Teal Mask, which were the elite challenges in the first expansion of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack. This is good news, as the Kitakami Ogre Clan was a great way of spending time, especially for those who are in the endgame portion and have most of their regular teams maxed out. Merrick mentions that even if the player’s teams are Level 80 and above, the battles against the NPCs in the Terarium can be “trickier” than those presented in a “standard play through of a Pokémon game.”

Merrick also cites that this is the basic level of challenge players should expect in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, as the Blueberry Elite Four are even more difficult to beat. The preview session allowed them to face Amarys with a different team instead of the Level 80 team they were using while exploring. The reason, as stated by Merrick, is that the previous team “just couldn’t handle facing off against Amarys,” so a Level 88 team was provided within a different save file. Merrick also mentions that they were told to expect to lose the battle.

According to the preview, Amarys used “classic and brutal Double Battle strategies” and it seemed like every creature in her party had the means to counter its own weaknesses. With such a description, it seems like the teams used by the Blueberry Elite Four member were carefully built by an actual player to pose a remarkable challenge to those who are well-used to competitive battles. The description of such a new challenge in The Indigo Disk seems to diverge from what was provided by The Teal Mask and the base Scarlet and Violet games. Merrick cites that Level 100 teams will still hold an advantage.

Nevertheless, this seems like a big shift in the performance of Trainer NPCs in the Pokémon series. It is not common for battles to be difficult, especially when playing through the main content. Merrick mentions that what they saw with Amarys reminded them of the “later levels of a Battle Tower facility” rather than the campaign or even endgame content. They also cite that, as Amarys is a simple member of the Blueberry Elite Four and not the actual leader, they are curious about how the endgame portion of the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet will present when it comes to challenging players in battles.






 Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Seems To Stimulate Interest In VGC 
          

The way that the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet reportedly leans into Double Battles and incentivizes players to think strategically when building teams seems to be an effort to push them into competitive matches and maybe even the VGC (Video Game Championships). Though there is a large pool of players that is highly invested in such tournaments, competitive battles do have a status of being excruciatingly tough and dominated by tryhard Trainers. Swirling this type of battle into the core of the gameplay experience is a great way of making even casual players more accustomed to the competitive format.

With them well-invested in Double Battles, perhaps their interest in competitive gameplay will arise, which would be a win for Game Freak. The developer has often encouraged players to participate in competitive battles through promotional content – in Sword and Shield, for instance, Shiny versions of the Legendary Galarian birds were given out to players who participated in the Battle Stadium during set periods. If this is the actual end goal, increasing the challenge in the DLC with Double Battles is a pleasant and franchise-changing strategy. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk’s release date is set for December 14, for Nintendo Switch.
