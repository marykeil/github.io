 All Companions Who Can Join Your Camp In Baldur’s Gate 3 
         

The first set of NPCs who join Camp are your Companions. They’re unique in the sense that they can join you on your adventures, lending you their skills in combat and exploration. They’ll also be your main romance and relationship options in Baldur’s Gate 3. There are ten main companions, but it can be trickier to recruit some than others.

 Name  How To Recruit   Astarion  Find him on the northern beach road on the Ravaged Beach in Act One.   Gale  Rescue him from the damaged Roadside Cliffs Waypoint in Act One. If you don’t help Gale with his personal quest, he may leave.   Karlach  Speak to her by the Risen Road, south of the Risen Road Tollhouse in Act One. Choosing to recruit Karlach has dire consequences for Wyll.   Lae’zel  Free her from a cage just north of the Roadside Cliffs Waypoint in Act One.

Wyll can be found teaching tiefling children how to fight.   Halsin  Find and free him from the Goblin Camp in Act One, and do not attack the Emerald Grove. Halsin initially joins the camp as a non-party companion, but eventually becomes a full companion in Act Two.   Minthara  Offer to help her attack the Emerald Grove in Act One or ignore the Emerald Grove entirely. If not killed or made hostile, she reappears at Moonrise Towers in Act Two, and can be recruited. Good-aligned players can recruit Minthara, although this can be difficult.   Jaheira  Speak to her at the Last Light Inn in Act Two. She can join the party during the final assault on Moonrise Towers if not made hostile.   Minsc  Pursue the Stone Lord into the Lower City Sewers in Act Three. Minsc will initially be under the control of the Absolute and is hostile to the party. However, he can be recruited if you use non-lethal attacks to knock him out and demand the Emperor’s assistance with recruiting him.   






Many of your companions are recruited early on, so make sure to complete Baldur’s Gate 3’s massive first Act before moving on to Act Two. Apart from your companions, several non-companion NPCs can join your camp, whether temporarily or permanently.

Yenna and Grub  Yenna will approach the player as they enter Rivington in Act Three and ask for help. She will appear at camp later and can be invited to stay. If invited, she will bring her cat Grub along and sell soup, which the player can use as camp supplies.   Mizora  Mizora appears in Act Three to give Wyll a choice between saving his father and breaking his devil’s pact with her. She will stay permanently regardless of his choice.

Players should also keep an eye out for other characters such as the famed wizard Elminster, who will appear at camp, but only during cutscenes. However, these characters won’t stay and can’t be interacted with. Your Camp can get rather busy in Baldur’s Gate 3, so it’s worth coming back often to meet your companions and followers.
