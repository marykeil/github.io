## Literature Review

Originally released for PC in 2014, Geometry Dash is an incredibly challenging but fun indie rhythm-based action platformer developed by one person. Typically, the game is pretty cheap at only $3.99 on the Steam Store, but during the Steam Winter Sale, the game is 50 percent off at just $1.99.

This makes it the perfect game for the holidays. At its core, the title game is a fast-paced arcade side-scroller that will challenge even the most skilled platforming veterans.

 What Is Geometry Dash? 
         

Geometry Dash is an action-platforming title with a heavy rhythm influence and developed by just one person, Robert Topala, the founding member of RobTop Games. In Geometry Dash, people control a small icon on the screen and must navigate the level&#39;s obstacles without tripping into one of the game&#39;s hazards. The icon on the screen must jump around spiked blocks and lava pits while navigating through portals set behind catchy EDM. While the game boasts nearly 30 different official levels, where it truly shines is its in-game level builder and the thousands of maps created by the community.

Also referred to as a runner-style game, Geometry Dash is incredibly simple in its design while simultaneously being particularly difficult, to the point of near frustration. With six different difficulty settings ranging from &#34;Easy&#34; to &#34;Extreme Demon&#34; mode, there&#39;s really no limit to how far one can push oneself in terms of difficulty. Another major feature of the game is the map creator, which has boosted the title&#39;s popularity as community creations are often inventive and even more formidable.



Geometry Dash will be on sale via the Steam Store during the Steam Winter Sale for $1.99 until January 4, 2023.








 

Geometry Dash was originally developed in 2013 for mobile devices but was later ported to the PC in December 2014, gaining a small cult following from the community and influencers willing to take on the challenge. As one would expect, it&#39;s often the ever-present and reoccurring miserable failures that elicit a large view count, as the game&#39;s punishing levels and different community challenges are what make it the most fun. In the spirit of modern-day platformers with punishing gameplay, while challenging, Geometry Dash&#39;s incredibly tough learning curve is also a key factor in why the game is so highly praised.



 Geometry Dash Is Blowing Up On Steam 
          




As of the time of writing, the small indie title is exploding on Steam, with its maximum player count peaking at over 88,000 people, according to SteamDB. This is mainly in part to the recent Geometry Dash 2.2 update, which introduced a host of new content, including new levels, game modes, and enhancements to the title. While originally scheduled to release in October, the 2.2 update for Geometry Dash comes at just the right time, as it coincides with the title&#39;s sale on Steam.

                  10 Best Indie Games Of 2023   Many great games were released in 2023, making it more difficult for smaller devs, yet numerous incredible indie games won over the gaming community.   

The new level is frantic and fast-paced, with several sub-levels and interesting new content, including physics changes that may challenge even veteran Geometry Dash players. Of course, like most of the game&#39;s levels, there&#39;s also a heart-pounding soundtrack to go with the more frantic portions of the level. Though the game is nine years old at this point, RobTop has managed to incorporate many new concepts into the new update while knocking out many of the issues in the previous build of the game.






 Geometry Dash 2.2 Update Is A Long Time In The Making 
          

Regardless of how simple Geometry Dash appears to be on the surface of things, it&#39;s actually a result of over a decade of hard work from RobTop. Starting on the free Flash game website, Newgrounds, Topala began his game development journey with games like Bounce Ball Thingy, Boomlings, and Memory Mastermind. It wouldn&#39;t be until Geometry Dash that RobTop would truly see such wide success, with the game having been downloaded more than 20 million times across platforms.

Like the development of the game itself, this highly polished and improved version of Geometry Dash didn&#39;t happen overnight. The original sneak peek for version 2.2 of the game occurred all the way back in 2021, and has since accrued more than 20 million views on YouTube. 2022 and 2023 would see more game trailers for the update via YouTube, but it wouldn&#39;t be until the end of the year when the game would be officially updated to its current form.






The Geometry Dash 2.2 update was officially released on December 19, 2023.




Geometry Dash has seen a variety of mobile spin-offs created by RobTop, including Geometry Dash Lite, Meltdown, SubZero, and World. The game has generally positive reviews from many gaming publications and maintains a 7.8 rating on Metacritic. The Geometry Dash 2.2 update would mark the first time the game saw an update in over half a decade, potentially re-invigorating a whole new audience to the addictive side-scrolling platformer. The game can be purchased during the Steam Winter Sale on PC for $1.99 for a limited time, or users can purchase it for their mobile devices for the same price.
