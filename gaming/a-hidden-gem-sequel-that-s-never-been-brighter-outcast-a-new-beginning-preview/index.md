## Literature Review

Cool guns, satisfying explosions, giant rideable aliens, and an awesome jetpack might make Outcast: A New Beginning a sequel worth the 25-year wait.




Outcast: A New Beginning is a sprawling adventure game with high-flying mobility, customizable combat, and a fascinating alien world to explore. The original Outcast was a highly influential PC release in 1999 as one of the first 3D open-world adventure games. Now, 25 years later, Outcast: A New Beginning is ready to introduce new audiences to its well-constructed alien world of Adelpha.




Outcast: A New Beginning is technically a sequel to the 1999 PC game, but players who have never experienced the original Outcast can enjoy the new game without feeling lost. Cutter Slade returns in the 3rd person action-adventure game inspired by the optimistic sci-fi often featured in 80/90s movies and comics.

                  &#34;A Cyberpunk Sifu With Gun Fu&#34;: Spine Preview   Dramatic and intense gun fu is often reserved for over-the-top action movies, but Spine looks to change that with its fluid and stylish combat.   


 Adelpha&#39;s Open World Isn&#39;t Another Barren Wasteland 
          

The lush world of Adelpha is a world occupied by tribes of intelligent alien life known as the Talans. However, their freedom and the beautiful planet&#39;s resources are in danger. If Cutter is to return home, he must first reunite the tribes against invaders and hostile wildlife that cover the open world&#39;s huge map that takes hours to traverse on foot. However, developer Appeal Studios has ensured that players won&#39;t get bored by repetitive fetch quests to progress the story or to upgrade Cutter&#39;s vast mobility and combat abilities.




          

Outcast is not filled with traditional side quests. Instead, Cutter will visit different villages, gain the trust of its citizens, and find out what needs to be done to unify Adelpha&#39;s Talans. Helping its citizens will gain favor and resources that will prove essential in the game&#39;s later sections. Players will have the freedom to explore and complete whatever tasks they wish, including examining the alien world&#39;s unique wildlife. However, ignoring the needs of each village will be a missed opportunity to meet Outcast&#39;s incredibly well-written cast of characters.

          




The Talans are a civilization with their own customs, terminology, and gods (Yods) that will all play a significant role in Outcast&#39;s story. Even though the Yods gift Cutter with knowledge and the ability to use the Talan&#39;s language, players will encounter many new phrases ingrained in the alien&#39;s way of life. A handy pop-up glossary explaining Talan terminology can be summoned with a single press of a button, even during cutscenes. Including the new words and customs helps Outcast&#39;s world-building significantly and makes Adelpha feel like a foreign world worth exploring. Luckily, Cutter Slade has an incredible jetpack to do just that.



Outcast: A New Beginning takes place 23 years after the first game, but Cutter Slade doesn&#39;t remember what happened.






 Two Guns And A Jetpack To Save The World 
          




The world of Adelpha is occupied by lush green forests and pastures, vast bodies of water, snowy mountains, and ruins that players can all explore. As resources are gathered, and skill trees are unlocked, mobility opens up significantly, and it becomes clear that the developer has designed Outcast&#39;s progression to feel fun and balanced instead of a grind. Traversing the varied landscapes becomes a lot easier thanks to Cutter&#39;s jetpack. A glide-suit add-on, the ability to soar above the ground, and other boosts will eventually allow skilled players to essentially fly through mountainous landscapes and even float above water. While upgrading mobility is a blast, players will have even more combat customization options.

          

Cutter Slade uses only two guns: a pistol, and a rifle. Outcast&#39;s combat begins to get creative when each gun is equipped with modules that grant them different attributes, like homing bullets, alternative ammo types, and other combinations that can be adjusted simply in the pause menu. If players assist Adelpha&#39;s citizens, new modules and abilities can be unlocked that can even manipulate the world&#39;s wildlife in destructive ways. Abilities like summoning a rain of bombs from a flock of pterodactyl-like creatures and riding large flying skyworms will aid Cutter in reclaiming Adelpha.






 Outcast: A New Beginning Seems Like A Gift From The Yods 

 

The preview session included several sections of the game with different progression levels. Players who hope to complete Outcast&#39;s 30 - 35 hour campaign will experience a steady growth of new abilities and weapons that&#39;ll help keep gameplay feeling rewarding. Players who dedicate themselves to helping as many Talans as possible will eventually see different villages beginning to cooperate, enabling even more resources for Cutter Slade&#39;s journey. If Outcast: A New Beginning launches smoothly on March 15, 2024, it will be a glorious return of the epic sci-fi open-world adventure and an intriguing prospect for new players.
