Gwan Hee has been very popular among the ladies on the island, especially during the second half of the season. He has been caught in a love triangle and has found himself on the wishlist of no fewer than three women.

The next day, he met office worker Yun Ha-jeong, and the two had undeniable chemistry.

 Single&#39;s Inferno Season 3&#39;s Gwan-hee&#39;s Age 
          

Single&#39;s Inferno star Gwan-Hee was born on April 29, 1988, which means he falls under the Taurus zodiac sign and is currently 36 years old. Taurus men are said to make dependable love matches for the right partner. They are also intelligent and thoughtful communicators who are slow to process emotions. This is seen in Gwan-hee by the way he can&#39;t seem to decide between three women. Hye-seon, Ha-jeong, and Min-ji are forced to be patient while he mulls over his choices.

Gwan-hee, who&#39;s 6&#39; 3&#34;, is a professional basketball player who plays in the Korean Basketball League (KBL). He played the shooting guard position for the LG Sakers since 2021 but was later traded from the Seoul Samsung Thunders. He was a part of the LG Sakers&#39; stellar 2022-2023 season, where they had the league&#39;s second-best record but would fall short in the post-season. Before playing in the KBL, Lee played in the Filipino Professional Basketball Association (FPBA).

Gwan-hee is active on Instagram (leegwanhee0429), where he posts mostly about basketball and food, which he clearly loves. He has also posted photos of himself with his fellow Single&#39;s Inferno castmates, shots of himself working out at the gym, and at least one adorable photograph of Gwan-hee as a toddler. With the Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 finale quickly approaching, it is hard to say which of the three women Gwan-hee will escape the inferno with- or if he goes home alone.






Single&#39;s Inferno is streaming on Netflix. Episode 10 drops on Tuesday, January 9, 2024.
