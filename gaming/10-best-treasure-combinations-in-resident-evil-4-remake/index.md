## Literature Review

There are 10 treasure items that can be combined with gems to increase their value, but each has a specific combo that will achieve the max profit.





Gems are an integral part of treasure combinations, but a limited number of each jewel is found throughout one playthrough. As you search for each treasure&#39;s location in Resident Evil 4 Remake, remember that the highest sale total for one item may not be its best fusion. If you waste all of one Gem on its most valuable combination right away, you&#39;ll lose out on extra Pesetas earned later.
The Treasure Bonus System dictates how a Gem&#39;s value can increase when combined with each other. Make sure to study which fusions lead to the best jewels used for bigger and better treasures. 

            
 
 Resident Evil 4 Remake: How To Increase Treasure Value 
Treasure items can be increased in value by combining them with gems. Some can be sold for as much as 100,000 Pesetas.












 








 10  Flagon 
Items: 2 Rubies
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Flagon    4,000 Pesetas     Flagon With Gems    12,000 Pesetas    
One of the lowest-value treasures in RE 4 Remake is the Flagon, which is not worth pairing with the more expensive Gems found in the game. This item has two round Gem slots, which should be perfect to slot in two Rubies. A Ruby is one of the least valuable jewels Leon can find, but it can still boost the Flagon&#39;s selling price from 4,000 Pesetas to 10,000.
Putting two Gems of the same color together in a single treasure combination applies a 1.2x multiplier to the item&#39;s final price. The overall value of the Flagon with both Rubies becomes 12,000 Pesetas due to this system. 





 9  Elegant Bangle 
Items: 2 Rubies
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Elegant Bangle    5,000 Pesetas     Elegant Bangle With Gems    13,200 Pesetas    
A measly 5,000 Pesetas base value makes the Elegant Bangle the second-cheapest treasure Leon has the chance to pick up. In the same way as the Flagon, you&#39;ll want to pair Rubies with the Bangle to not waste rarer Gems in RE 4 Remake. Each Ruby will raise the price of the Bangle by 3,000 Pesetas, bringing the total to 13,200 when you consider the same multiplier as the Flagon. 
If you are a little short on Gems, try completing the Resident Evil 4 Remake Merchant Requests. There are several in the game, and they will reward Spinels, which can be traded for Gems themselves, or maps that reveal the location of other treasures and jewels. 






 8  Splendid Bangle 
Items: 2 Alexandrites
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Splendid Bangle    4,000 Pesetas     Splendid Bangle With Gems    19,200 Pesetas    
The Splendid Bangle is only worth slightly less than the Elegant Bangle, but it has more potential when paired with Alexandrite Gems. The presence of two rectangular slots on the item instead of circular spots seen on the previous two treasures in RE4 Remake. The base price of 4,000 Pesetas can again be bolstered by the 1.2x multiplier by having two Gems of the same type infused into this Bangle. 
If you are having any trouble finding these treasures, feel free to check out a video from YouTube creator Neon Slice that shows you where to collect each item that hosts Gem slots. 



Unlike Rubies, every Alexandrite puts an extra 6,000 Pesetas onto this treasure in RE4 Remake. The 16,000 Pesetas total from each Gem becomes 19,200 if you use 2 Alexandrite. This gives you a 3,200 Pesetas profit from this unique combination of Gems that aren&#39;t particularly hard to find. 





 7  Extravagant Clock 
Items: 1 Alexandrite and 1 Sapphire
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Extravagant Clock    9,000 Pesetas     Extravagant Clock With Gems    20,900 Pesetas    
The Extravagant Clock has one rectangle slot and one round slot, making it very different from other treasures you may have found in RE4 Remake. The high base price of 9,000 Pesetas may tempt you to sell it fast, but the Gems you put in this item raise its potential significantly. However, since the slots are different sizes, the multiplier for the Clock ends up being 1.1x instead of 1.2x.
A Sapphire is worth 4,000 Pesetas on its own, and an Alexandrite can raise the price by 6,000. This will make the Clock sell for 19,000 Pesetas at first, but the multiplier brings the total value of the item up to 20,900.
            
 
 All Treasure Locations In Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways 
There are 56 expensive Treasures found in all seven chapters of Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways that can fund weapons and items from the Merchant.








 6  Elegant Mask 
Items: 1 Yellow Diamond, 1 Sapphire, 1 Ruby
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Elegant Mask    5,000 Pesetas     Elegant Mask With Gems    24,700 Pesetas    
Even though the Elegant Mask treasure has a measly base value of 5,000 Pesetas, a larger 1.3x bonus multiplier through the right Gems significantly raises this item&#39;s sell price. Three round slots could fit three Yellow Diamonds, but this prevents you from using those Gems on other items in RE4 Remake. A conservative approach with multiple Gem types can bring the Mask&#39;s total to an impressive 24,700 Pesetas. 





 5  Butterfly Lamp 
Items: 3 Yellow Diamonds
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Butterfly Lamp    6,000 Pesetas     Butterfly Lamp With Gems    37,800 Pesetas    
The Butterfly Lamp breaks the rule mentioned earlier since 3 Yellow Diamonds actually yield the best reward when combined with this item. The 6,000 Pesetas base price increases by 7,000 for each Gem, bringing the total to 27,000. A special Trio multiplier gives you a massive 10,800 Pesetas profit with a 1.4x multiplier, but only if you have enough Diamonds in RE4 Remake when you get this treasure. 
A video by YouTube creator Neon Slice shows the process of combining Gems to an important treasure, and compares the final selling price of different jewels infused into items like the Butterfly Lamp. 








 4  Golden Lynx 
Items: 1 Yellow Diamond, 1 Emerald, 1 Sapphire
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Golden Lynx    15,000 Pesetas     Golden Lynx With Gems    40,300 Pesetas    
A treasure called the Golden Lynx has the highest base price of the items on this list at 15,000 Pesetas in RE4 Remake. Two round slots and one rectangle slot are best paired with an Emerald, Sapphire, and Diamond to bring the treasure&#39;s total price to 31,000. The 1.4x multiplier applied to this item creates a final sell price of 40,300 Pesetas due to three unique jewels being used for the process in RE4 Remake. 





 3  Chalice of Atonement 
Items: 3 Red Beryls
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Chalice of Atonement    7,000 Pesetas     Chalice of Atonement With Gems    47,600 Pesetas    
Three rectangle slots demand Gems that you have saved up for a while in RE4 Remake to create a version of the Chalice of Atonement item that sells for the most money. The 3 Red Beryls added to this treasure will raise its base price from 7,000 Pesetas to 27,000. The finished product nets you a profit of 13,600 thanks once again to the 1.4x Trio multiplier that comes from using three jewels of the same type. 





 2  Ornate Necklace 
Items: 2 Red Beryls and 2 Rubies


 







   Item    Selling Price     Base Ornate Necklace    11,000 Pesetas     Ornate Necklace With Gems    59,500 Pesetas    
The second most valuable treasure Leon can find in RE4 Remake is the Ornate Necklace, whose starting price of 11,000 Pesetas should already give you a good idea of its potential. This item has four slots that benefit from the highest value Gems you have in your possession. The goal here is to maximize earnings from the 1.7x multiplier from the Quartet bonus, which is only available for the Necklace.
The two Red Beryls and two Rubies will add 24,000 Pesetas to the Necklace, creating a final selling price of 59,500 when you factor in the multiplier. The 24,500 Pesetas profit earned from this Gem combination is the largest one you can obtain, with only one exception in RE4 Remake. 





 1  Elegant Crown 
Items: 1 Red Beryl, 1 Emerald, 1 Alexandrite, 1 Yellow Diamond, 1 Sapphire
        

   Item    Selling Price     Base Elegant Crown    19,000 Pesetas     Elegant Crown With Gems    100,000 Pesetas    
The highest-selling treasure in RE4 Remake is the Elegant Crown, which has a base value of 19,000 Pesetas. This item has five Gem slots that allow it to obtain the best 2.0x multiplier in the game, doubling the Crown&#39;s selling price. Every Gem mentioned will bring the treasure up to 50,000 Pesetas in value before this effect creates an object worth an astounding 100,000 Pesetas. 
Selling every item on this list with each Gem mentioned for each treasure will give you 375,200 Pesetas in total when you sell each object to the Merchant. 

Make sure to save your Red Beryls and Yellow Diamonds until you acquire the Crown since these two Gems are in limited supply. The Astute Appraiser achievement will be rewarded to anyone who can sell an item for over 100,000 Pesetas with the best treasure combination in Resident Evil 4 Remake.
