## Literature Review

To welcome Vanellope von Schweetz to Disney Dreamlight Valley, players must complete a DreamSnaps challenge and find a spot to build her house.





Much like the quest to unlock Simba in Disney Dreamlight Valley, Vanellope’s quests aren’t particularly tough. When entering the game after the latest update, players will receive The Haunting of Dreamlight Valley automatically. This quest tells players to chat to Scrooge McDuck, who requests that they investigate a mysterious ghost in the Dream Castle. To get started, head inside the Dream Castle, where Vanellope can be found near the back of the castle by the fountain.





 How To Complete Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Faith, Trust, And Pixel Dust Quest 
          

Interact and talk to Vanellope to unlock the &#34;Faith, Trust, and Pixel Dust&#34; and Pixel Dust quests. These quests will require you to complete DreamSnaps challenges, where you will have to decorate certain areas with items and then click a picture of the scenery.

          

To complete the DreamSnaps challenge, you must decorate an area with five Playful Items and five Familiar Items. You can easily find these items in your inventory by using the Filters menu. Select the &#34;Familiar&#34; and &#34;Playful&#34; options to filter out the items that can be used for this quest in Disney Dreamlight Valley.




          

Any items with one or both of these Traits will count for this challenge. Place and arrange the items where they can be captured in the same photograph. It doesn’t necessarily need to look nice, but you are free to use any decorating skills you have learned from completing Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Hakuna Matata quest. Once all the items are in place, you should use the in-game phone to take a picture.



The game will actually tell players if you have included all of the right items and allow you to submit the photo to DreamSnaps.






 How To Recruit Vanellope In Disney Dreamlight Valley 
          




After you have submitted an image containing five Playful and Familiar items, head back to the castle and speak to Vanellope. She will tell you that she will be happy to stay in the valley as long as there is a beacon to anchor her. This means you need to place Vanellope’s house somewhere in the village.



To place a house, head outside and open up the furniture menu. Vanellope’s house can be found under Requests, allowing you to place it wherever there’s enough space.




          

Once you have picked a spot for Vanellope’s house, you can interact with Scrooge’s sign to complete construction. This requires 4,000 Star Coins; which you can get by cooking some great recipes to earn Star Coins if you don’t have the funds. This allows you to finally welcome Vanellope to your Disney Dreamlight Valley village.
