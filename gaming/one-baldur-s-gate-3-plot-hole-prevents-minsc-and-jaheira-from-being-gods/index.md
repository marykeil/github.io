# One Baldur s Gate 3 Plot Hole Prevents Minsc And Jaheira From Being Gods


## SUMMARY 



  Minsc and Jaheira&#39;s experiences in prior games aren&#39;t accounted for in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 strictly caps all playable characters&#39; levels, meaning Minsc and Jaheira can never be as powerful as they used to be.   Minsc and Jaheira&#39;s levels may have been reset for balance and customizability, but their prior adventures are acknowledged through lore, Easter eggs, and in-game secrets.

## Literature Review

Minsc and Jaheira aren’t as powerful as they should be in Baldur’s Gate 3. Here’s why, and what it would look like if the game took a different route.




If it weren&#39;t for one Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 miscalculation, Minsc and Jaheira would be god-tier superheroes. It&#39;s hard to think of a game like BG3, which seems to have thought of everything, having plot holes. It&#39;s an incredibly reactive game, with a million different options, contingencies, and what-ifs that aim to make softlocks and narrative dissonance near impossible. And these systems do succeed at what they set out to do - Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has an internally consistent logic that pervades its every aspect. Where it falters, however, is on its connection to the rest of the series.




As much as it is a standalone title, it&#39;s called Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for a reason. It includes more than a handful of recurring locations, concepts, and characters from the first two games, and two of those are Minsc and Jaheira. They both debuted as party members in the original Baldur&#39;s Gate, and have reappeared or been referenced in all the other titles since. They&#39;re once again recruitable as non-Origin companions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but they may not be quite as players of the earlier games remember them.

                  10 Hidden Baldur&#39;s Gate Mechanics Most Players Will Never Discover   Baldur’s Gate 3 explains a lot in its tutorials, but you have to experiment to find some of its hidden mechanics. We’ve done the work for you.   


 Minsc And Jaheira Start From Level One In BG3 
          




Despite all the experience they&#39;ve gained throughout the rest of the series, Minsc and Jaheira start Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 back at level one. Although they technically first appear at higher levels, as soon as they join the party they&#39;re rolled all the way back to the beginning. Of course at this point, they instantly gain all the XP the party has gained throughout the game, and players can go through the motions of leveling them back up until they&#39;re on even footing.

The reasoning for this change is obvious: having these two characters join the party at already maxed-out levels would be disastrous for balance. Plus, characters who can&#39;t level up anymore are boring. Starting them from level one ensures that players can mold their stats and abilities so they better mesh with the rest of the party.

And anyway, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 strictly caps all playable characters&#39; levels at 12. That makes it necessary to ignore at least some of the XP Minsc and Jaheira should have from previous games, since there&#39;s simply no room in the game&#39;s code for them to reach such high levels. If they were fully leveled up as of the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 and its final DLC, Throne of Bhaal, they would&#39;ve each been roughly level 40. That&#39;s something Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and even newer editions of tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons, just can&#39;t do.






Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 doesn&#39;t have a traditional level cap, but with all the DLC installed, it maxes out the XP each character can earn at a cool 8,000,000. However, since it&#39;s based on the Second Edition of DnD, in which different classes level at different rates, not every character is able to reach the maximum level of 40.




It&#39;s hard to say just what level maxed-out Minsc and Jaheira would be if transplanted directly into modern DnD, since so many mechanics have changed and Fifth Edition rules only allow for levels up to 20. But even if they simply started at the maximum level of vanilla tabletop 5e, that&#39;d make them godlike beings from the very start.



 What Minsc And Jaheira Would Look Like At Level 20 In BG3 
         

Just how powerful Minsc and Jaheira would be if their levels in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 accurately reflected their prior experiences varies by class. Minsc, of course, is a ranger. At level 20, DnD 5e rangers get a feature called Foe Slayer, which allows them to add their Wisdom modifier to any roll once per turn. Yes, this can be applied to attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, even damage calculation. In short, this ability makes the level 20 ranger incredibly capable. With this additional bonus, they&#39;re practically guaranteed to succeed at whatever they&#39;re trying to do.




Plus, high-level rangers can see invisibility, hide as a bonus action, and gain temporary HP a few times per day. And assuming Minsc would be a ranger of the Beast Master subclass, he&#39;d also be able to apply any spell-based buffs he cast on himself to his hamster companion Boo. Ranger spells only go up to level five, so they might not be able to bend the very fabric of reality like some high-level, overpowered DnD spellcasters. But Minsc and Boo would be a force to be reckoned with at level 20, especially with enlarge/reduce to restore that miniature giant space hamster to his true size.

Jaheira is a druid, which means she progresses through levels primarily by unlocking new Wild Shape forms and more powerful spells. At level 20, druids gain the Archdruid feature, which gives them unlimited uses of Wild Shape, an ability that was previously limited to two per short rest. So not only would level 20 Jaheira be able to turn into a variety of giant, imposing creatures, but she could also do so as much as she wanted. She could even take the form of an animal with unique abilities, like a raven with flying speed and Rend Vision, then swap out into mammoth form to deal massive damage.




When starting out, DnD and BG3 druids have to choose a primary mode of combat: spellcasting or shapeshifting. At higher levels, with more spell slots and cooler Wild Shape forms, there&#39;s a bit more of a balance. A druid can start a battle in human form, cast a few AoEs at enemy groups, then transform into an owlbear to finish off any stragglers. But at level 18 in DnD, druids receive a class feature called Beast Spells, which allows them to cast certain spells while in Wild Shape. At level 20, that rule extends to almost every druid spell.

And Jaheira&#39;s ninth level druid spells would be shockingly forceful. True resurrection can literally bring people back from the dead with full HP and all diseases cured. Foresight allows them to see the future. And storm of vengeance rains 10 turns of damage and status effects down on enemies in a radius of 360 feet, with different unique effects each round. These can&#39;t all be cast as Beast Spells, but still, they&#39;re powerful additions to the max level druid&#39;s arsenal.






 BG3 Ignores Minsc And Jaheira&#39;s XP, But Not Their Experience 
Easter eggs acknowledge their prior adventures
          

Even in between the Baldur&#39;s Gate games, Minsc and Jaheira have been busy. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s clear lore around exactly what Minsc has been up to. The spin-off comics Legends of Baldur&#39;s Gate frequently feature Minsc and Boo, and the five-issue run &#34;Infernal Tides&#34; suggests that immediately before the events of BG3, Minsc set out to purge Baldur&#39;s Gate of demonic corruption by fighting devils and Mind Flayers in Avernus. And if MInsc is around when the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 party encounters Sarevok, the final boss of the original Baldur&#39;s Gate, the Bhaalspawn will immediately recognize him in a fit of rage.

Jaheira, meanwhile, is a little more secretive about her life before Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. However, when they reach the titular city, the party can visit Jaheira&#39;s home, where they&#39;ll learn she&#39;s been busy caring for several adoptive children. What&#39;s more, a hidden room in Jaheira&#39;s house contains equipment from prior Baldur&#39;s Gate games. Players can pick up the Staff of the Ram, the Belm scimitar, and an amulet called Khalid&#39;s Gift. This is a reference to Jaheira&#39;s husband Khalid, who was killed during the events of the original Baldur&#39;s Gate. This demonstrates that, despite her often hard exterior, Jaheira is sentimental at heart.




There&#39;s little point in speculating on why Minsc and Jaheira&#39;s levels are reset; whatever lore-friendly explanations can be concocted, it&#39;s obvious that the real reason is for balance and customizability. While it&#39;d be fun to portray them as heroic demi-gods, it&#39;d mean they couldn&#39;t stick around for long without making the game too easy. As it is, it&#39;s nice to just have Minsc and Jaheira around in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, to track their continuing adventures and see new sides of these old, familiar heroes.
