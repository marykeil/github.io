## Literature Review

The boss zombie Mega Abominations in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies give tons of XP when killed, but it can be hard to track down all their spawn locations.





Keep in mind that Mega Abominations will usually appear in red zone locations on your map, which have the highest population of zombie hoards in the game. Try to get some of the best weapons for Modern Warfare 3 Zombies for you or your squad before hunting a Mega Abomination. If you have the right Schematics unlocked, you can bring a certain item into deployment that can help against these bosses, too.

 Every Mega Abomination Location in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

There are seven different places where the Mega Abomination can spawn, but all of these are in the red High-Threat zones on the Urzikstan map. You can narrow down spots based on the rows and columns of the map, which are divided into numbered and lettered coordinates. The special zombie will appear in three areas of F4, one spot in E5, another place in F5, and two sections around location G4.

When you get close to a Mega Abomination spawn, your map should have a unique icon to track as it moves around. You may find this symbol on your map immediately if you accept an Abomination Bounty Contract or a special mission requiring you to kill the special zombie as an objective. Doing this quest will only give you a few fixed rewards in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.






The Abomination Bounty Contract&#39;s fixed reward is Essence, the primary currency to spend on items at Buy Stations.




Killing a Mega Abomination is best done when you have the right resources, like strong Perk-A-Cola items that can give you a power boost in a fight. A Sentry Gun in Modern Warfare 3 is one of the most powerful tools against this type of zombie since it can distract the creature and deal extra damage. Taking down a Mega Abomination will reward you or your squad with a ridiculous amount of XP and possible Rift Rewards.

Once you know all the Mega Abomination spawn locations in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, you can devise a strategy to defeat them quickly during a deployment for many important rewards.
