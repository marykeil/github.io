## Literature Review

If you&#39;re unsure about which Contestants to play in The Finals or how to play them, then rely on the best builds for each class to get you started.





The best abilities and gadgets to get first in The Finals are heavily influenced by the class you play. What&#39;s more, the different Contestant types are all designed so they can be played with more than one style - one of the things The Finals does better than other FPS games. For example, you can build the Heavy to be a pure tank that soaks damage or an offensive powerhouse that constantly deals damage.





 Best Light Build 
          

In either game mode, the Light Contestant is one of the most important members of a team. They can swoop in and steal a cashout in Quick Cash and quickly flee the scene when their pockets are overflowing with cash in Bank It. Furthermore, they are one of your team&#39;s hardest-hitting members. As a result, best to go with a fast and damage-oriented build.

Light Build 1 - Damage Focused
 Specialization  Weapon  Gadgets  Reserve     Grappling Hook or Evasive Dash       M11, SH1900, LH1, V9S, XP-54       Breach Charge, Gas Grenade, Goo Grenade       Personal weapon choice, Stun Gun, Frag Grenade, Pyro Grenade      



You can use either the Grappling Hook or the Evasive Dash for this build; both are good movement-based options. Following that, you should use any of the ranged weapons. The V9S Pistol can melt players if you hit your shots, but the XP-54, as a submachine gun, is more reliable. You&#39;ll want to equip the Breach Charge for Gadgets. Then, you can choose between two different grenades, but the Gas and Goo grenade is a great combo to have for Quick Cash.






You can swap between the items in your Reserve during a death. As a result, this is where you can tailor your build to your tastes or the game mode you&#39;re playing. So, rather than following the recommendations, do what works best for your game.




Light Build 2 - Invisible Menace
 Specialization  Weapon  Gadgets  Reserve     Cloaking Device       Dagger or Sword       Stun Gun, Frag Grenade, Gas Grenade       Personal weapon choice, Breach Charge, Flashbang, Pyro Grenade      



Everyone has been on the receiving end of this build one too many times. This is the Light Contestant&#39;s invisible build, which allows you to backstab opponents to death. First, you must equip the Cloaking Device as well as the Dagger or Sword. Next, it&#39;s essential you get the Stun Gun, so you can stop enemies dead in their tracks. Finally, a Frag and Gas Grenade provides some much-needed AOE damage to this build.

Not only is this one of the best Light Contestant builds in The Finals, but it&#39;s also one of the most rage-inducing builds to die from.



 Best Medium Build 
          




Because the Medium Contestant is such a versatile class, it can be built in a variety of ways. However, it&#39;s typically built to be either a dedicated medic or an objective-securing machine in Quick Cash and Ranked Tournaments.

Medium Build 1 - Dedicated Medic
 Specialization  Weapon  Gadgets  Reserve     Healing Beam       AKM, FCAR, R.357, CL-40, Model 1887       Defibrillator, Jump Pad, Goo Grenade       Personal weapon choice, Zipline, Frag Grenade, Pyro Grenade      



Naturally, you&#39;ll choose Healing Beam as your Specialization for this Medium medic build. Your weapon of choice is entirely up to you; the only option not on the list is the Riot Shield. Then, in terms of gadgets, the Defibrillator is the item that ties everything together. You can choose whatever you want for your other two gadgets, but the Jump Pad is a nice addition due to the added movement.

You&#39;ll still be in the thick of the action with this build, however, you&#39;ll end the game with a Support Score equal to your teammate&#39;s Combat Score.

Medium Build 2 - Team Player Build
 Specialization  Weapon  Gadgets  Reserve     Guardian Turret       AKM, FCAR, R.357, CL-40, Model 1887       Defibrillator, Jump Pad, Goo Grenade       Personal weapon choice, APS Turret, Zipline, Sonar Grenade      






This is one of the best builds to take into Ranked Tournaments when combined with an appropriate Heavy Contestant build, as the sole focus of this build is securing down the site. After your team has secured the cashout, you can use your Guardian Turret and Goo Grenades to secure the site (The Heavy&#39;s Dome Shield and Barricade also help with this). You can also use your Jump Pad to block off doorway entrances. After you&#39;ve set up shop, all you have to do is hit your shots and hold site like your life depends on it.



The effectiveness of this Medium Contestant build is greatly enhanced when combined with the Dome Shield and/or Barricade Gadgets of the Heavy.






 Best Heavy Build 
          




With the most health and damage out of all the Contestants, the Heavy is one of the best classes to play in The Finals. And, you can either build the Heavy class to be a team tank or a team brute. 

Heavy Build 1 - Team Tank
 Specialization  Weapon  Gadgets  Reserve     Mesh Shield       M60, Flamethrower, Lewis Gun, SA1216, Sledgehammer       Barricade, Dome Shield, Choice of grenade       Personal weapon choice, C4, RPG-7, Choice of Grenade      



The Heavy Contestant team tank build combines the Mesh Shield Specialization with the Barricade and Dome Shield gadgets. With those three devices in your pocket, you have more than enough shield to fortify a site and protect your teammates. Furthermore, if you can combine this Team Tank heavy build with the Team Player Medium build, you&#39;ll have one of the best build synergies for cashouts in Ranked Tournaments.



While often overlooked, the Flamethrower and Sledgehammer often prove to be the best weapons to use with either of these Heavy builds.







Heavy Build 2 - Damage Dealer
 Specialization  Weapon  Gadgets  Reserve     Charge &#39;N&#39; Slam       M60, Flamethrower, Lewis Gun, MGL32, SA1216, Sledgehammer       RPG-7, C4, Frag Grenade,       Personal weapon Choice, C4, Gas Grenade, Pyro Grenade      



Some players simply take advantage of the Heavy&#39;s health to charge headfirst into every fight they see. If that&#39;s the case, one of the best abilities to get first for the Heavy is the Charge &#39;N&#39; Slam. Combine that with any weapon, as well as an RPG-7, C4, and Frag Grenade, and you&#39;ll have the most powerful and reckless damage-dealing build in all of The Finals.
