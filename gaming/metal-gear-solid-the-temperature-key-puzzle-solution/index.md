## Literature Review

Metal Gear Solid has an incredibly frustrating puzzle that involves backtracking to different areas in order to change the temperature of a key.





After defeating bosses like Psycho Mantis in Metal Gear Solid, you&#39;ll eventually reach Metal Gear REX and grab a PAL key needed to deactivate the nukes. The key is found in the command office and is yellow-colored when you look at it. Your mission here is to change the temperature of the key so that it changes color twice, then return to the office and interact with the command console two separate times.






You have to leave the command office and return two times, once for every time you change the PAL key temperature.

To change the PAL key to Blue, you need to expose it to cold temperatures, which are thankfully easy to find close to Metal Gear REX. Return to the area where you fought Vulcan Raven, then wait for the key to turn blue after a short time. Checking the Item Menu will let you see if the PAL key has changed colors as you avoid guards and other enemies in Metal Gear Solid.

Once the key turns blue, return to the top of Metal Gear REX to the command office and use the key on the computer. Be careful since enemies repopulate this spot each time you return from altering the PAL key&#39;s color in Metal Gear Solid. There are gun turrets near the entrance, along with two cameras that will lock the doors to the office and summon several guards if Snake gets spotted at any point.

As one may expect, changing the PAL key to a Red color requires exposing it to hot temperatures, which involves much more backtracking than before. You have to return to the Blast Furnace area, filled with molten liquid, to heat up the key. Two lift rides stand between Snake and this room, with very few spots to safely hide as the key gets warmer and warmer in Metal Gear Solid.




Find a good spot to duck from enemies while the heat affects the key, then go back to the office and interact with the computer just like you did with the Blue key. This will trigger a trap where the room begins to flood, and you&#39;ll need to call Otacan for help. Putting on the Gas Mask from your inventory should help you get past the Temperature Key puzzle once and for all, leading to the next segment of Metal Gear Solid.
