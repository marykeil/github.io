## Literature Review

There are several Pokémon that could be put under the spotlight for a Legends: Arceus-like game, even if it is a spin-off. Here are some of the best.




With the success of Legends: Arceus, there are several core Pokémon games that could follow in its wake. The game that wrapped up Generation 8 titles was released to critical acclaim, offering a new type of gameplay and open-world exploration that was, until then, unknown to the classic Nintendo franchise. The game is set in Gen 4’s Sinnoh region, but hundreds of years back, when it was still known as Hisui. At that time, humanity was still establishing itself within villages in the region, which made for an interesting story set in ages past, while still maintaining a lot of its connection to present-day Sinnoh.
There were many ancestor characters in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, further deepening the lore of the Hisui and Sinnoh region. Aside from NPCs, the presence of Origin Formes also made the ruling Pokémon deities of the area much more interesting. This type of formula, that makes Legends: Arceus different from normal Pokémon games, could be applied to more spin-off-styled core titles, allowing players to revisit certain regions and stories from a new perspective.

 10  Pokémon Legends: Mew 
Kanto (Gen 1)


 







One Generation and region that could benefit from a game in the style of Legends: Arceus would be Gen 1’s Kanto. While it is the most explored region in terms of games, mainly due to commercial purposes fueled by nostalgia, there are a lot of secrets that can explored within Kanto. In fact, an open-world game in the first Pokémon region would be ground-breaking. With Mew at the forefront, this could make for an interesting game that answers a lot of unresolved issues.
Mew is said to have the DNA of all living Pokémon, so that could be further explained. In addition to this, players could witness when Mew was first discovered by Team Rocket’s Miyamoto, which occurred nearly 20 years before the events of Red and Green. In a Legends: Mew game, players could witness how the Pokémon Mansion burned, the experiments, and everything else that is hinted at during the Gen 1 titles.





 9  Pokémon Legends: Ho-Oh 
Johto (Gen 2)


 







Possibly the best contender for a Legends: Arceus-like game, Gen 2’s Johto region could shine more light on the events that led to the burning of the Brass Tower and the death of the beasts, which led them to be resurrected as Legendaries Raikou, Entei, and Suicune by Ho-Oh. In fact, the Legendary bird should be at the center of the adventure.
Ho-Oh is a recurring element in the series and seems to be more important than its popular counterpart, Lugia, which could also be included in the game somehow. The existence of a Pokémon Legends: Ho-Oh could even be justified by the presence of Celebi, which is capable of traveling through time and, perhaps, taking players to when the events took place.





 8  Pokémon Legends: Rayquaza 
Hoenn (Gen 3)
        

As the head of the super-ancient Legendary Pokémon, Rayquaza would be a great fit for a Pokémon Legends game. While the creature was deeply shown in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, with the introduction to its Mega form, there could be a temporal displacement that takes players to the past in Hoenn, where they get to see the events that took many years before Gen 3 games.
In fact, it is known that Rayquaza is capable of calming down both Groudon and Kyogre, having done so twice. While the first time may be hard to see, as this is when the creatures created Hoenn itself, players could travel back to when Mega Rayquaza forced Kyogre and Groudon into a hibernation period. Hoenn is a region rich in lore and mystery, and a fan favorite as well.





 7  Pokémon Legends: Darkrai 
Sinnoh (Gen 4)
        

While Sinnoh and Hisui regions have been deeply explored with Gen 4 games and then Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there is still space to uncover more mysteries. One of the most interesting, yet least discussed topic is Darkrai, a creature responsible for spreading nightmares.
The Dark-type Mythical is a counterpart to the Legendary Cresselia and, together, they could share the spotlight in a new Pokémon title. Uncovering the source of the nightmares, figuring out how to stop them, and hunting down Darkrai across an updated version of Hisui or Sinnoh could make for an appealing plot.





 6  Pokémon Legends: Genesect 
Gen 5 (Unova)
        

Another Mythical creature that could be the headliner for a Pokémon Legends game is Genesect. While it plays a smaller part in Black and White in comparison to some of Gen 5’s Legendaries, Genesect is actually quite interesting. This creature was revived from a fossil and had technological parts added to it – so players have never really seen its true form.
In such a game, players could travel back and understand how Genesect was before turning into a fossil and how important it is to Unova – and, ultimately, what led Team Plasma to choose that specific fossil to turn into the most powerful creature known to humanity. An ancient Unova could also be home to alternate versions of other Pokémon, much like Hisui had its Hisuian versions.





 5  Pokémon Legends: Hoopa 
Kalos (Gen 6)
        

Hoopa is one of the most interesting creatures in Gen 6, and its Mythical status is helpful to define it as a protagonist of a Pokémon Legends game. This elusive monster is known for bending dimensions and is known to have two forms, one of which is Confined, and the other is Unbound.
With Hoopa as the main character in the game, responsible for some sort of phenomenon in the Kalos region, players could be sent across dimensions and timelines while trying to investigate it. A Pokémon Legends: Hoopa game would be an exciting way of revisiting Kalos.





 4  Pokémon Legends: Poipole 
Ultra Space (Gen 7)
        

Poipole could be the most innocent and well-intended being among the Ultra Beasts, but it could also serve as a player’s companion as they venture through Ultra Space in a Pokémon Legends game. Through a Wormhole, a Trainer in Alola could be sucked into the dimension from where Ultra Beasts come from rather than having to face these alien creatures in a tropical paradise.
There is much that is unknown about Ultra Space and, with it being a realm composed of several different worlds, a Pokémon Legends: Poipole could explore these, offering a lot of variety in terms of maps, as well as new and exclusive Pokémon to capture.





 3  Pokémon Legends: Zeraora 
Alola (Gen 7)
        

If a game set in Ultra Space is too much trouble – essentially because it would likely imply no previous Pokémon other than the known Ultra Beasts could be recycled – a Legends game in Alola could work, especially if focusing on the Mythical and very rarely seen Zeraora. This fan-favorite creature is not often featured in games, yet is remarkable when it does.
With Wormholes, players could possibly be sent to an alternate version of Alola, trying to calm down Zeraora, who has now found itself lost in a strangely familiar world that is not exactly home.





 2  Pokémon Legends: Zarude 
Forest of Okoya (Gen 8)
        

Zarude was loosely featured in Gen 8 games and instead shined bright in the Secrets of the Jungle anime movie. The Mythical creature is an inhabitant of the Forest of Okoya, a new spin-off region that fits the Pokémon Legends format quite decently.
Within the new area, players could encounter new and returning Pokémon while also disrupting the villainous operations that are affecting the natural life of Okoya – which has been upsetting the population of Zarude and causing a general crisis in the area. This would not need time travel, but a simple visit to another area.





 1  Pokémon Legends: Eternatus 
Galar (Gen 8)


 







Gen 8’s Sword and Shield is rich in lore and, as players adventure through Galar, they uncover the mystery of the Darkest Day, which happened millennia before the events of the game itself. In a Pokémon Legends-styled game set in Galar, players could visit the region when the first Darkest Day occurred.
There, they could meet and likely even aid the Ancient Galarian Kings in holding back Eternatus with the power conceded to them by Zacian and Zamazenta. The Gigantamax encounters could be dealt with in a way similar to Noble Pokémon in Legends: Arceus. There are many new adventures to explore in Pokémon games based on pre-existing regions and stories, and this is just one of them.
