## Literature Review

Players who locate and activate the 5G Towers in the open world of Goat Simulator 3 will unlock additional in-game content and a bonus cutscene.





Once players locate a tower, they must activate each one by completing an electricity puzzle which will contribute to the completion of the 5G upgrade test. These towers have been scattered across San Angora, but each 5G hub can be located and activated with relative ease.




                  Why It&#39;s Goat Simulator 3 &amp; Not Goat Simulator 2   When Goat Simulator 3 was announced as the sequel to 2014&#39;s Goat Simulator, many were left wondering whether a Goat Simulator 2 existed.   


 Activating &amp; Establishing the Intergalactic Connection 
          

You can find the first 5G tower in Fairmeadows Ranch, which is located in the southern region of the map. After hopping the gate to gain entry to the power plant, you must locate a broken junction box. Ramming into this junction box will electrocute the goat and generate an electrical charge for a short time. Use the goat to carry the electrical charge to 3 nodes within the power plant. Once all 3 nodes are charged it will activate the tower, and a giant beam of electricity will be shot across the map.

The second tower in Goat Simulator 3 can be found in the east section of Surburbsville, and is easily identified by a blacked-out van that has been parked outside the entrance. Follow the same steps as above to activate this tower and there&#39;ll be only one left.




                  Funniest Goat Simulator 3 Easter Eggs   Goat Simulator 3 is full of secret Easter eggs that play into the game&#39;s wacky nature. Here are some of most hilarious ones that you can find.   

The third and final 5G tower is located at the peak of San Angora in Goatenburg and is nearby the Dystopia building that is marked on the world map. Once players activate the final 5G tower they will establish an &#39;Intergalactic Connection&#39;, and immediately unlock an extraterrestrial bonus in the form of an in-game cutscene.

As the Intergalactic Connection is established you will find the game world invaded by 3 giant UFOs. Entering any of these UFOs will allow you to fly across San Angora and wreak havoc, by shooting projectiles and beaming up innocent civilians.
