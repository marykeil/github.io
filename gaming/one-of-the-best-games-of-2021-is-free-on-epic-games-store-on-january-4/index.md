## Literature Review

The Epic Games Store has reached the finale of its holiday celebration with another free game giveaway on January 4, an interstellar action-adventure.




The Epic Games Store has reached the final offering of its holiday season daily giveaways, and it arguably saved the best for last: Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy. The game from developer Eidos-Montreal didn&#39;t perform exceptionally well financially, but is one of the more endearing titles released in 2021. GOTG being the headliner for EGS&#39;s holiday giveaways is not only a good conclusion to the season, but will help this often overlooked third-person, action-adventure shooter reach a new, wider audience.




Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy is the last of the daily giveaways by the Epic Games Store, and has become available for download at 11 AM ET/8 AM PT. It&#39;s available to download until January 11, marking the storefront&#39;s transition back to weekly giveaways, and follows the free EGS game on January 3, A Plague Tale: Innocence, rounding out the celebration with a couple of heavy hitters. This final free game on January 4 is the 16th daily game given away by the EGS this holiday season, and EGS is now expected to return to its usual weekly game giveaways in 2024.

                  Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy Review: An Exciting But Clunky Adventure   Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy is a fast-paced adventure full of bombastic combat and shines most in its characterization and choice mechanics.

Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy follows the now well-known team of interstellar heroes, but Eidos-Montreal&#39;s versions of the characters themselves are separate iterations from those found in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord), Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot begin the game hoping to capture a rare space beast for Lady Hellbender, who&#39;s dubbed herself the Monster Queen. To do so, the Guardians travel to the Quarantine Zone, a restricted area under the jurisdiction of Nova Corps. The story starts out innocuous enough, but the trip to the Quarantine Zone quickly spirals out of control to threaten the galaxy.

                  A Marvel&#39;s Guardians Of The Galaxy Sequel Still Needs To Happen   Square Enix views the sales number for Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy as lackluster, but that shouldn&#39;t stop a sequel from being developed.   

Marvel properties aren&#39;t exactly underdogs, but GOTG came on the heels of the widely panned Marvel&#39;s Avengers, and with a similar focus on an ensemble cast, was subsequently written off by many who&#39;d been burned by Avengers&#39; lackluster live-service gameplay. GOTG puts players firmly in the Jet Boots of Star-Lord, however, for a third-person shooter with intriguing combos that can be leveraged by commanding the other accompanying Guardians. The highlight of the game, though, is its branching narrative, which gives players a series of dialog choices that affect the Guardians&#39; relationships throughout.




What could have been a rote superhero game turned out to be a more than enjoyable romp through the galaxy with an incredibly funny cast. It&#39;s certainly a high point in the Epic Games Store&#39;s holiday giveaways, and a nice conclusion to the celebration. This free EGS game for January 4 may be the last of those given away daily, but Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy is sure to satisfy, as it&#39;s one of the more charming games released in the last few years.
