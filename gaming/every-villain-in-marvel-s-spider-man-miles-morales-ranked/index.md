## Literature Review

Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not have the extensive villain roster of its predecessor, but it holds a high-quality cast regardless.




The spin-off title Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales isn&#39;t quite as long as its predecessor, but it still manages to juggle a handful of villains. Insomniac Games&#39; first game in the series, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, put players in control of an experienced Peter Parker, thus including a deluge of villains, including the Sinister Six. Miles Morales&#39; villain slate is comparatively modest, clocking in at a total of five, but this smaller cast works for the benefit of the spin-off&#39;s runtime and the constraints of its narrative.
Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales picks up roughly a year after the first game, and follows the exploits of a Spider-Man still learning the ropes. Peter Parker has left New York City to help Mary Jane report on a civil war in Symkaria, leaving Miles the sole Spider-Man for the time being. From crime bosses to technologically enhanced mercenaries and supervillains, Miles Morales really runs the gamut when it comes to big bads, despite its seemingly limited scope. Not every one of the game&#39;s villains can be a showstopper, though.
            
 
 Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Review: A Compelling But Truncated Adventure  
Spider-Man: Miles Morales buckles under a limited scope, but the protagonist&#39;s charm, a living world, and excellent action make it a worthy sequel.












 








 5  Kingpin, Alias Of Wilson Fisk 
New York City Crime Boss
        

Kingpin, known publicly as construction mogul Wilson Fisk, is an incredibly minor villain in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. It&#39;s revealed in a side mission that a group of criminals is working for Kingpin, sabotaging Harlem businesses and communities like the F.E.A.S.T. shelter. It&#39;s not exactly a surprise, since Kingpin is known for keeping his operations going, even in prison, where he&#39;s residing after the events of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. Miles only has one encounter with Kingpin via a video chat, but it serves to expand the history of Kingpin with a reference to his wife, Vanessa.
The conversation also helps establish a different dynamic between Miles and Fisk, with the latter mocking the former as a novice, implying Miles is a fraudulent Spider-Man. Kingpin is just as cold and heartless as ever, with the same calm, yet sinister persona returning from the previous game, where Kingpin served as a tutorial boss of sorts. While Kingpin hits all the right notes in Miles Morales, his constrained screen time isn&#39;t enough to lift him above any of the game&#39;s other villains.





 4  Rhino, Alias Of Aleksei Sytsevich 
Supervillain, Member Of The Sinister Six
        

 Rhino&#39;s first appearance in Miles Morales is as the tutorial boss prior to Peter Parker leaving for Symkaria, giving players a taste of the dual-protagonist gameplay that would truly emerge in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. This initial rampage through New York is a boisterous introduction to the game, and this set piece exemplifies the type of high-octane sequences Insomniac choreographs well, but Rhino&#39;s role becomes far more compelling after he falls into Roxxon&#39;s custody. After Rhino is stopped by the two Spider-Men, he is monitored by Roxxon, which claims the supervillain will be handed over to the police once they&#39;re on the scene.
This eventually leads to the highlight of Rhino&#39;s involvement in Miles Morales – a boss fight in which Miles and Phin as the Tinkerer team up against Rhino, who&#39;s been given a new suit by Roxxon that is immune to Miles&#39; bioelectric Venom powers. Finding a fault in Rhino&#39;s new suit, Miles and Phin eventually triumph, and the villain&#39;s ultimate fate is left unclear (though he&#39;s mentioned as a target of Kraven&#39;s Great Hunt in Spider-Man 2). Rhino&#39;s two boss battles are exciting, but his role in the story is that of a glorified henchman, which keeps him from cracking the top three when it comes to Miles Morales&#39; best villains.





 3  Simon Krieger 
Leader Of Roxxon Energy&#39;s Nuform Project
        

 Simon Krieger is the head of research and development at Roxxon, chiefly in charge of the company&#39;s effort to get Nuform used as an energy source throughout NYC, despite its health risks. Krieger isn&#39;t necessarily a novel villain – the charismatic, yet sinister megacorporaton executive is a trope that already appears in the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man universe via Norman Osborn. This, however, doesn&#39;t stop Krieger from emerging as a compelling, easy-to-loathe villain in Miles Morales. Although outwardly affable, Krieger consistently shows no regard for anyone but himself, constantly double-crossing his villainous allies for the benefit of Roxxon.
Krieger is introduced as the ultimate silver-tongued businessman who praises Spider-Man, but that is quickly shown to be a cover for a downright twisted individual. He&#39;s quick to anger, and his depravity has him orchestrating a terrorist plot that would see Harlem leveled, which he believes would ultimately provide Roxxon and Nuform with positive PR. Although Krieger has a wonderful screen presence throughout Miles Morales, there&#39;s no grand conclusion or final confrontation with him; he is simply taken to jail, which is unfortunately anti-climactic for an otherwise great villain.





 2  The Prowler, Alias Of Aaron Davis 
Miles&#39; Uncle, Professional Thief
        

 The Prowler is perhaps Miles&#39; most iconic villain, and his role in Spider-Man: Miles Morales doesn&#39;t disappoint. Essentially a high-tech thief and mercenary, Prowler is the alias of Aaron Davis, Miles&#39; uncle. A foil to Miles&#39; deceased father, police captain Jefferson Davis, the Prowler is almost a necessary component in characterizing Miles&#39; Spider-Man, exemplifying the great personal turmoil that may come with being New York&#39;s protector. Miles Morales&#39; treatment of the Prowler character works well on a number of levels; Aaron starts the game determined to leave his life of crime behind, but quickly becomes embroiled in the central conflict while trying to keep his nephew safe.
Although his intentions are altruistic, Prowler betrays Spider-Man on multiple occasions, working for Roxxon, and even going so far as to tranquilize his nephew and trap him in an abandoned subway terminal. Aaron claims it would be best to let Roxxon and the Underground fight among themselves, staying out of harm&#39;s way to let the dust settle, but Miles finds this course of inaction appalling when so many are in danger. The boss fight with Prowler is an emotionally charged highlight of the whole game, and serves as a turning point for both characters – a prelude to Aaron asking Miles to find the Prowler Stashes in Spider-Man 2, so he can finally put his alter ego to rest.





 1  The Tinkerer, Alias Of Phin Mason 
Miles&#39; Childhood Friend, Leader Of The Underground


 







The only villain in Spider-Man: Miles Morales able to exceed the emotional impact of the Prowler is the Tinkerer. Phin Mason inherited the alter ego from her older brother, Rick, who was killed by Krieger for attempting to shut down the Nuform reactor at Roxxon Plaza, knowing it would only bring harm. Much of the game sees Miles reconnecting with Phin, his childhood friend, and struggling to come to terms with her leadership of the Underground, which is essentially a domestic techno-terrorist organization. Throughout, Spider-Man and the Tinkerer are often allies hoping to stop Roxxon, but are more frequently enemies, since their two philosophies on justice are irreconcilable.
Flashback sequences provide plenty of context and verisimilitude to Miles and Phin&#39;s relationship, which makes it all the more heart-wrenching that the Tinkerer is the game&#39;s final boss. Battling the Tinkerer is technically demanding from a gameplay standpoint, and emotionally taxing on the narrative side. The fight&#39;s conclusion, which sees Phin sacrifice herself to save Harlem, redeems the Tinkerer at the eleventh hour, bringing Phin&#39;s story full circle and ending the game on a bittersweet note. Although Roxxon is the bigger threat to New York, the Tinkerer is the marquee villain of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Insomniac Games deftly handling her storyline secures the Tinkerer&#39;s spot as the game&#39;s best villain.
