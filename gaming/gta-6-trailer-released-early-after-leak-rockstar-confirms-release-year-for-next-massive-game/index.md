## Literature Review

After years of waiting, Rockstar has finally revealed the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, showing off the game&#39;s location and characters.





As with Rockstar Games&#39; previous reveal trailers for Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto 6 provided a look at some of the overhauled Vice City&#39;s breathtaking landscapes, and a glimpse at some of the denizens players are likely to cross paths with. The footage also introduced players to the game&#39;s Bonnie and Clyde-esque protagonists, Lucia and Jason, who are seen partnered together in a few different scenes, including a high-speed chase and a convenience store stick-up.





 

Rockstar Games seemingly released the GTA 6 trailer early in response to it being leaked. Aptly-named X (formerly Twitter) user Gta6trailerleak leaked a heavily obscured version of the trailer – much of the frame was taken up by the words &#34;BUY $BTC.&#34; The post was removed, and the account suspended shortly after the leak.

                  GTA 6 Needs To Steal Red Dead Redemption 2’s Most Important Story Feature   Grand Theft Auto 6 could learn a lot from Red Dead Redemption 2, but one feature in particular could offer the most far-reaching benefits.

The last time players saw Rockstar&#39;s fictional Miami-based location, Vice City was in the 80s-centric GTA: Vice City and its spin-off GTA: Vice City Stories. While these titles clearly took inspiration from the likes of Miami Vice and Scarface, Lucia and Jason&#39;s story seems to take place in the present day, with a distinctly modern spin on its 80s aesthetic, which should please long-standing fans of the franchise.

Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer oddly did not reveal which platforms the game would launch on. However, after years of waiting, the trailer confirmed that the game will be releasing in 2025, meaning players finally know when they can dive into Lucia and Jason&#39;s story. An accompanying press release from Take-Two Interactive confirmed that it will land on current-gen consoles only, with no mention of a PC release, indicating that GTA 6 will be released on PC at a later date, much like Rockstar&#39;s other major titles from the past decade, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2.




While this trailer is simply a teaser in terms of its story, it did provide its best look at Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s visuals and world, which are on par, if not a step up from, the universally praised graphics and open-world seen in 2018&#39;s Red Dead Redemption 2. The trailer footage appears to be entirely captured in-game to showcase the power of Rockstar&#39;s new RAGE engine, which aims to provide a fully current-gen experience.
