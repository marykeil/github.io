## Literature Review

Purple Flower Coins are used to unlock new areas and buy powerful items in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, making them an item you&#39;ll want to farm fast.





Some Toad workers around various Worlds will ask for Purple Flower Coins to unlock new paths, leading to new levels and other stages you can&#39;t normally reach. Those trying to find secret areas like the W1 Pipe-Rock Plateau Special Course in Super Mario Bros. Wonder will need to harvest plenty of Purple Coins to help reach these hidden spots. You may also spend Coinsat Poplin Shops for powerful items like Badges or a Wonder Seed.

Replaying Challenge Levels over and over is the best way to farm Purple Flower Coins since these stages are short and offer more currency than other areas in the game. For example, the Expert Badge Challenge: Invisibility 1 level in Super Mario Bros. Wonder has many Flower Coins scattered in its short segment. By playing this mission more than once, you can pick up many Coins from the same places in every run.



Playing as Nabbit allows you to transform power-ups on any stage into Purple Flower Coins, so you should play as this character whenever you are trying to farm this currency.







Another way to farm Flower Coins is to find every Captain Toad location in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. These hidden NPCs are found through warp pipes or secret exits to levels in various Worlds and provide 50 Purple Flower Coins when discovered. There are five Captains to look for, with a potential 250 Flower Coins available for those who have at least traveled to World 4.

Make sure to always collect the larger Coins you see in these challenge levels as you try to farm the currency since each is worth 10. Once you have enough Purple Flower Coins farmed, you can spend as many as you want in any unlocked world from Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The items you can buy from Poplin Shops for your gathered Coins are:
