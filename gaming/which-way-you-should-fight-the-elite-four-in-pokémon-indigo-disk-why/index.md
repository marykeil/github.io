## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC has its own set of Elite Four challenges. Players can battle them in any order, but which one is best?




In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s The Indigo Disk DLC, it&#39;s technically possible to battle the Elite Four in any order. The DLC adds a variety of new challenges, and with its focus on the Blueberry Academy for Pokémon trainers, trainer battles are front and center. As always, these culminate in the battle against the Elite Four and the regional Champion - in this case, the BB Champion. These are arguably the hardest battles in each Pokémon game, pitting players against the top five trainers in each region in a true test of their training, battling, and team-building skills.




Ever since Gen V, players have had the opportunity to choose the order in which they challenge the Elite Four. This can create a variety of interesting effects, allowing players to save resources for the most difficult battles or rearrange their teams for ideal composition. Ample preparation and a team consisting of the best new Pokémon in The Indigo Disk are the most important steps to success, but fighting the Elite Four in a calculated order could make all the difference. Here&#39;s the best way to take them on.

                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Full Pokédex: Every Pokémon Number &amp; Type   Over 200 Pokémon compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all of them, listed in order.   


 Best Order For The Elite Four In Pokémon: The Indigo Disk 
          




The Indigo Disk&#39;s Elite Four should be fought in the numerical order of their BB Rankings. The game gives all Blueberry Academy trainers a numerical representation of their strength. So, to battle the Elite Four by escalating difficulty, it&#39;s best to start with the lowest BB Ranking and work up to the highest. In that case, the best order in which to fight The Indigo Disk’s Elite Four would be: Crispin, Amarys, Lacey, then Drayton. After beating all four, players can move on to challenge Kieran, the BB Champion and possibly the strongest Pokémon trainer ever.



BB Rankings can be viewed by hovering over each Elite Four trainer&#39;s icon in the map menu.




But for the most part, all the Elite Four battles in The Indigo Disk are equally tough. When fought in ascending order of BB Ranking, and with adequate preparation, they&#39;ll be on even more equal footing. It doesn&#39;t make an awful lot of difference which order they&#39;re challenged in, as long as the player has a flexible, well-trained team.




However, it&#39;s best to challenge the Elite Four from weakest to strongest for a few reasons. For one thing, resource conservation can make later battles easier. There will be an opportunity to heal Pokémon between each battle, but it&#39;d be nice to go into the harder ones with a full stock of Medicines and status effect cures. There&#39;s also the concern of escalation: warming up with some easier battles can make the later, harder ones easier. Plus, a series of increasingly difficult battles just makes for a more satisfying story. Crispin first, then Amarys, Lacey, and Drayton may be the recommended order, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only one.



 Tips For Fighting The Elite Four In Pokémon: The Indigo Disk 
         

Much like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s base Elite Four, each of The Indigo Disk&#39;s Elite Four battles focuses on a particular Pokémon type, with a couple of surprises thrown in. For Crispin, that type is Fire, and players will have to make a Super-Spicy Sandwich to impress the master chef before they&#39;re even allowed the privilege of battling him. As a Fire-type trainer, Crispin can be handily defeated with any half-decent Water, Ground, or Rock-type Pokémon, but he does have one ace up his sleeve. Second in his line-up is a Heat Rotom, a dual Fire and Electric-type. Just use a Ground-type Pokémon, and Crispin&#39;s goose will be cooked.




Up next by BB Ranking order is Amarys, the Steel-type trainer. Players must complete a flying course challenge with Koraidon or Miraidon before challenging her. Steel-type Pokémon are vulnerable to Fire, Fighting, and Ground-type moves. However, Amarys has a few dual-type Pokémon with Ground affinity, which means they can foil Fire-type attacks and deal extra damage to Fire-type Pokémon. She also has a Reuniclus and a Metagross in the mix, both of which have access to Psychic-type moves. As a result, Fighting-type Pokémon do well against Amarys, but should be swapped when she brings out her Psychic-types.

Then there&#39;s Lacey, who requires players to complete a quiz on some of the cutest Pokémon before challenging her. Don&#39;t worry about getting questions wrong here. Players get two tries on each multiple-choice question, and even if they get it wrong both times, they can still proceed in the challenge by battling another trainer. Lacey&#39;s specialty is Fairy-type Pokémon, which makes her weak against Steel and Poison-types. However, it&#39;s important to watch out for her Excadrill, which has Ground and Steel-type moves, which both Steel and Poison-types are weak to. Excadrill will eventually Terastallize into a Fairy-type Pokémon, though, so Steel and Poison moves will still work well against it.




Finally, there&#39;s Drayton, arguably the strongest trainer in The Indigo Disk&#39;s Elite Four. Drayton requires players to beat three other trainers before battling him - the only catch is, they can only use Pokémon they&#39;ve caught in the Terrarium across the three warm-up battles. They&#39;ll be facing rivals with levels in the high 60s to low 70s, so it&#39;s okay if they&#39;re a little underleveled compared to the main team. As his name implies, Drayton is a Dragon-type trainer, so Fairy and Ice-types work well against him. However, he does have a Steel-type Archaludon, so Fairy-type Pokémon should be switched for Fighting, Fire, or Ground-types when he brings that one out.

But in the end, the order in which players fight the Elite Four is truly up to personal choice. While proceeding from Crispin to Amarys, Lacey, and Drayton appears to be The Indigo Disk&#39;s recommended order, there&#39;s really no need to follow that if it doesn&#39;t suit an individual&#39;s preference. Depending on team composition, it may not even be the ideal order for some players, but it is pretty reliable for most. But as always, the most important tools for beating The Indigo Disk&#39;s Elite Four in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are preparation and a well-balanced team.
