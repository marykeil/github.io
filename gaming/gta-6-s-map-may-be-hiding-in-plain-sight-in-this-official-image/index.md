## Literature Review

Eagle-eyed fans have scoured the background of GTA 6&#39;s first official artwork, and believe the game&#39;s full map of Leonida is hidden within it.




Rockstar Games may have hidden Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s map in an official piece of art for the game. After years of speculation and leaks, the studio finally provided its first official look at the highly-anticipated title that showed the outlandish antics of some of Leonida&#39;s residents and introduced the game&#39;s protagonist, Lucia, and an unnamed man as they go on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque crime spree across the state.






Previous leaks referred to Lucia&#39;s partner in crime as &#34;Jason&#34;.




It had long been rumored that Grand Theft Auto 6 would return to the Miami-esque Vice City for the first time since 2002&#39;s GTA: Vice City and its 2006 spin-off GTA: Vice City Stories, and this was confirmed in a massive leak that consisted of 90 development videos. The official, record-breaking trailer has now shown through its in-universe social media footage that the game will be leaving behind the 80s setting of the previous Vice City-set titles, and should also include a far greater map that explores the wider state of Leonida, which is very clearly inspired by Florida with many real-world locations appearing or being parodied throughout the trailer.

                  GTA 6 Trailer Released Early After Leak, Rockstar Confirms Release Year For Next Massive Game   After years of waiting, Rockstar has finally revealed the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, showing off the game&#39;s location and characters.   





 GTA 6&#39;s Leonida Map May Be Hidden In Its First Official Artwork 
Eagle-Eyed Fans Have Scoured The Image&#39;s Background
         

Accompanying Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s first trailer was the first official artwork for the game with its playable protagonists, Lucia and Jason sitting atop the hood of a car in Vice City. While on the surface this image was only intended to provide a greater look at the couple and a glimpse of the game&#39;s location, highly observant fans believe it may have shown a lot more of Leonida than it seemed.

Redditor InevitableLibrary387 pointed to what they believe to be the inclusion of GTA 6&#39;s full map on the wall of a building in the distance to the bottom right section of the image. While InevitableLibrary387&#39;s attempt to zoom in on the image resulted in it becoming extremely pixelated, there was enough clarity in what shapes were still visible to back up their suggestion that there is &#34;Vice Beach on the right, a city in the middle, and scattered islands around it&#34;.





 

X user NikTekOfficial explored this further by using color correction and Topaz Labs&#39; AI-powered image-enhancing tool, Gixapixel, on the poster to make the hidden map more visible, confirming that it is an actual map with different areas of land to further support InevitableLibrary387&#39;s theory. They then provided a comparison between the color-corrected poster and an ongoing community-driven mapping project on the GTA6 subreddit.

This mapping project has been built from the 2022 GTA 6 leaks and has used Rockstar&#39;s RAGE Engine&#39;s measurement units to compare it to GTA 5&#39;s Los Santos. While the fan-made map doesn&#39;t exactly match up to the one shown in the poster, it is possible that it only showed one area, and that GTA 6&#39;s full map could be far larger than previously believed.





 


 

                  GTA 6&#39;s Setting &amp; Location: Everything We Know About Leonida &amp; Vice City   GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. Drawing on the trailer, the original Vice City, and its real world basis, here’s what to expect from GTA 6’s map.   



 How Big Could GTA 6&#39;s Map Be? 
There Could Be Several Cities To Explore In Leonida
         

There has long been a rumor that Grand Theft Auto 6 will have multiple cities outside of Vice City. While many believed this could have included Liberty City from GTA 3, GTA: Liberty City Stories, and GTA 4, and Los Santos from GTA: San Andreas and GTA 5 as part of a project codenamed &#34;Project Americas&#34; with four playable protagonists. There had also been reports that while Project Americas wasn&#39;t continued as an idea, GTA 6 could still explore areas outside of Vice City, such as Cuba - which could tie into Los Cabrones, the Cuban gang that played a fairly large role in the GTA: Vice City and GTA: Vice City Stories - and the Rust Belt-inspired Carcer City, which had previously only been mentioned within the GTA series and serve as the primary setting for Rockstar&#39;s Manhunt game instead.




Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s first trailer seemed heavily focused on Leonida, however, making these rumors seem unlikely. While an America-spanning GTA title now seems less possible - unless Project Americas is reborn as a second iteration of GTA Online - there is still some likelihood that the rumors of multiple cities in GTA 6 may not be entirely incorrect, but instead, these will be different cities within the state of Leonida, as shown in the enhanced version of the poster. This would certainly be one way to make GTA 6&#39;s map larger than GTA 5 and GTA Online&#39;s and return to the popular location of Vice City while providing plenty of new areas to explore to keep things fresh for longtime fans of the 26-year-old franchise.

Alternatively, it&#39;s possible that the map shown in Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s first poster was simply made up of some shapes to look like a map, has no relation to the game&#39;s actual map, and wasn&#39;t intended to be analyzed so closely. With Grand Theft Auto 6 now confirmed to be targeting a 2025 release window, Rockstar should hopefully begin to provide more information about its modern-day version of Vice City and its surrounding areas over the next year, letting players know exactly where they will be able to explore and wreak havoc upon the game&#39;s launch.
