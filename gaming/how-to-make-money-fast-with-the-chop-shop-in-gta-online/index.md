## Literature Review

The Chop Shop business in GTA Online allows you to make money quickly by running a Salvage Yard and conductingÂ good old-fashioned grand theft auto.





Before you can start reeling in the cash from the Chop Shop business, you&#39;ll need to know all the Salvage Yard Locations in GTA Online and how to unlock them. Furthermore, that covers everything you need to know about the Chop Shop and getting your Salvage Yard up and running. Once everything is set up, you can focus on what matters most: making money.






It&#39;s best to buy one of the Salvage Yards located in the city, as this is where the majority of the missions take place. This will cut a lot of time out of driving, which will allow you to complete missions quicker and make money faster.





 Money-Making Ways in The Salvage Yard 
          

The Salvage Yard provides two main ways to earn money in the Chop Shop business: Salvage Yard Robberies and the Tow Truck Service.

Salvage Yard Robberies
The first Chop Shop money-making method is through Salvage Yard Robberies, which you can access from the computer in your Salvage Yard. These are car robberies, with three available each week. Not as simple as you might think, car robberies have multiple stages, such as scoping out the scene, devising a plan, gathering necessary items, and finally carrying out the robbery - very similar to a heist. After that, you can salvage the car for parts, or sell it to Yusuf for a cash profit. Typically, the latter is the most profitable.






You won&#39;t be able to access car robberies on the computer in your Salvage Yard until you&#39;ve first registered as a SecuroServe CEO or are the president of a Motorcycle Club.




Tow Truck Service
The Tow Truck is an optional service that you can add to your Salvage Yard. To obtain it, you must purchase one of two tow trucks, which cost $1,100,000 and $650,000, respectively. They perform identically; the price difference is purely aesthetic. Nonetheless, it&#39;s worthwhile to buy one because it opens up salvage jobs for the Tow Truck Service, allowing you to earn even more money from the Chop Shop.

Once you&#39;ve bought the Tow Truck, jump inside, and you&#39;ll gain access to the Tow Truck Service missions. For these missions, you simply drive to the target vehicle, hook it up to your Tow Truck, and drive it back to your Salvage Yard, where it will be scrapped for a cash profit. However, you will not receive the money right away; it will take two in-game days to salvage the vehicle and receive the money for it. You can expect to earn anywhere between $30,000 and $60,000 from each salvaged car.






If you purchase the Staff ($625,000) upgrade for the Salvage Yard, the time it takes to salvage a vehicle and receive the profits will be reduced from two days to one.




Once you&#39;ve got your Chop Shop up and running, you&#39;ll be pulling in a profit quickly. With all this extra money, you may want to take a look at the GTA Online weapons every player should own. After all, in the GTA Online car-stealing business, you never know when things will turn awry, and you&#39;ll need some firepower to help finish the job.
