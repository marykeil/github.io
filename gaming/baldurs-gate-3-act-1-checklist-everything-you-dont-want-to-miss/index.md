## Literature Review

Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3 has much to see, like recruitable characters, hidden bosses, and other secrets that might require a checklist.





Many quests and choices have multiple outcomes. Baldur’s Gate 3 is specifically designed to be played through multiple times, making alternate story decisions in Act 1. This list is optimized to see the most, typically making strictly morally good and orderly selections. But, a more chaotic playstyle will close off some of this route.
