## Literature Review

Speculation of a new, non-RTS Starcraft may have some fans excited, but there&#39;s already a solid RTS game being made by ex-Blizzard developers.




Though Starcraft 2 will go down as arguably the best real-time strategy game of all time, it&#39;s been seven years since the last expansion for the title, Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void, was released, leaving those who enjoy RTS games lacking content over the past decade. While other RTS games have certainly launched, like 2023&#39;s Company of Heroes 3, none have lived up to the lofty heights that Starcraft 2 set in the 2000s. Indeed, it was mainly the Starcraft and Warcraft RTS titles that spawned an entire professional Esports industry, with players from around the world competing for what was, at the time, incredibly high cash prizes.




So ravenous for a new game in the franchise, a Bloomberg article detailing a new title in the Starcraft franchise had people excited about the prospect of a new game. According to the reporting, it&#39;s not a result of a lack of trying that a new Starcraft game has been created. Many Blizzard staff members who worked on RTS titles had left the company over the years. When asked, the President of Blizzard, Mike Ybarra, seemed open to the prospect of a new Starcraft game, though it could come in the form of another genre, like the ill-fated Starcraft: Ghost that languished in development for nearly a decade before being completely canceled.

                  StarCraft II: 10 Reasons Why It&#39;s Still Worth Playing Today   It might be over 10 years old, but there is still plenty of reasons as to why StarCraft II is worth playing again.    


 Stormgate Has Ex-Starcraft Developers Working On It 
          




Luckily, for fans of the RTS genre of video games, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel, and it might not be a Starcraft game at all. While most who have enjoyed the series over the years likely have some nostalgic connection to characters like Sarah Kerrigan and Jim Raynor, the real issue for competitive players is a lack of a modern alternative to SC2. Stormgate is a new RTS currently under development by the creators of beloved Blizzard franchises like Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2.

                  Blizzard Ends Most StarCraft 2 Support, Future Of Franchise Unclear   Blizzard announces the end of any major update plans for StarCraft 2, putting the game and franchise&#39;s future in question moving forward.   

Frost Giant Studios, the studio creating the game, is led by CEO Tim Morten and President Tim Campell. Morten is a long-time thought leader in the RTS industry as the former Production Director of StarCraft II and C&amp;C: Generals 2. Campell is another industry vet and was previously the Game Director of Wasteland 3 and the Lead Campaign Designer of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. Alongside them are talented ex-Blizzard staff, including artists and designers who have had a hand in making the Starcraft and Warcraft universes as popular as they are today.






 Stormgate Has Professional SC2 Player Involvement 
         

Stormgate has been in development for a few years at this point and has gained a lot of attention from Starcraft 2 professional Esports players, like the Dutch Protoss player Harstem and German Zerg player TLO. This input from the top echelon of players bodes well for the competitive quality of the title when it is finally released. After all, the Starcraft and Warcraft franchises of RTS games took years of balance tweaks and patch fixes to get them in the state that so many remember to this day.



Stormgate will also have a deep single-player story for those not trying to climb the multiplayer ladder.




Not only is the company working with professional players to market Stormgate, but the company actually employs people who have also had a huge hand in supporting the Starcraft community, including organizations like Team Liquid and Day[9]TV. This concerted effort to connect with the community of people that made SC2 and WC3 is something that die-hard fans will truly appreciate.






 Stormgate Is Currently In  d Beta Testing 
          

While no official release date for Stormgate has been set as of writing, closed beta testing for the game started July 1, 2023, and will go into 2024. During this time, the developers will focus on testing and core functionality of 1v1 gameplay. People can sign up for the beta on the official Stormgate website. Not much has been revealed about Stormgate, but a three-minute gameplay reveal does clue people into what they can expect from the new title. There are two factions announced so far, with a third faction remaining mysterious.


 




The aesthetic seems to be a combination of Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2, with snappy, micro-intense skirmishes along with the typical macro base building. The humanoid faction resembles Terran from Starcraft 2, with drop ships microing and repositioning mobile armies. The demon faction looks similar to the Zerg, with close-range melee units resembling Zerglings. Though it&#39;s still currently unknown, the third faction could be something akin to Protoss, with more powerful single units in army compositions. That&#39;s not to mention that the developers have yet to state how many races there will be, lending itself to theories of more than three playable factions.



 A Spiritual Successor 
          

Though only time will tell whether Stormgate will rival the popularity of Starcraft at its heights, from every indication, it will follow in the footsteps of iconic titles like Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2. While it still remains undetermined whether people are yearning for an RTS generally — as other popular genres like ARPGs and MOBAs have dominated gaming charts over the past few years — those who enjoy the strategic gameplay of real-time strategy titles should be excited about the upcoming release of the game.




                  Warcraft 3 Reforged: Every Cheat Code (&amp; What They Do)   Warcraft 3: Reforged is a remake of the classic real-time strategy game. Blizzard included some fun cheat codes for solo players to take advantage of.   

After all, it&#39;s been so long since a popular RTS has taken society by storm (pun intended), and Stormgate may be the game to introduce the video game genre to an entirely new Gen Z audience. With the rise of technically complex titles like the building mechanics in Fortnite, it&#39;s more than possible that younger gamers of a new generation will fall in love with the intricate gameplay that RTS titles can provide. This doesn&#39;t even mention the huge international audience for the game, as South Korea has always been considered the country with the best RTS players in the world, where famous Starcraft superstars are known to many in the mainstream.

While the future of Stormgate certainly looks bright, time and public reception will ultimately determine whether the new game generates a broad appeal. However, those looking for a brand-new RTS alternative to Starcraft 2 should consider checking out Stormgate for themselves.
