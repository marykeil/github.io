## Literature Review

One of the best items for spell casters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the Markoheshkir, a legendary staff that you can get to channel magic and deal damage.





You can find the Markoheshkir Legendary staff in Ramazith&#39;s Tower, the home of a powerful mage whose home is part of the Lower City within Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The fastest way to reach the Tower is to go to the upstairs area of the Sorcerous Sundries shop. You will find a light blue portal that should take you to Lorroakan, the spell caster who lives within the Tower.




  


 How To Find Markoheshkir In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 (BG3) 
          

Once you are through the portal, avoid any conversation with Lorroakan. Instead, move towards the floating furniture to the side of the portal, which hovers between two Tower floors. Use Misty Step, Jump, or Teleport to the lower floor. If a party member can see through invisibility, use the ability or use a potion in this area. You will soon spot a hidden grate labeled &#34;Below&#34; on this floor.

Interacting with the pedestal next to this secret grate causes your party to be teleported to an even lower area in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, with two magical items surrounded by magical barriers. One of these is the Markoheshkir staff, but it is impossible to deactivate the protective dome around it without using the invisibility effect. If the effect you used before is still lasting, you should see two levers next to each item&#39;s barrier.






The other item in the second barrier on the lowest floor of Ramazith&#39;s Tower is called the Robe of the Weave, which restores a character&#39;s hit points whenever they succeed on a Saving Throw against a spell of any kind.




One of the levers can remove the magic so that you can acquire the Markoheshkir Legendary Staff. To do this, you or a party member needs to succeed in a DC 20 Arcana skill check. However, if you have Gale as a companion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and he has a high Intelligence Ability Score, you should be able to clear the check easily. Once the barrier is turned off, you can easily walk up and collect the quarterstaff.

Markoheshkir deals bludgeoning damage as a melee weapon but acts as a &#43;1 magic item that boosts its damage and hit chances. The Arcane Enchantment ability on this staff gives you a &#43;1 bonus to your Spell Save DC and spell attack rolls. However, the best trait you&#39;ll find when you get Markoheshkir&#39;s legendary staff in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is Arcane Battery, which makes the next spell you cast not cost a spell slot.
