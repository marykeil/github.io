# Marvel s Spider-Man 2 Venom Makes Every Character More Relatable


## SUMMARY 



  The Symbiote in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 causes physical, mental, and emotional damage to the main characters, but their relatable reactions make their depictions more enjoyable.   Those unfortunate enough to play host to a Symbiote have some of the most volatile aspects of their personality brought to the forefront, airing often relatable grievances.   Even those who simply come in contact with the Symbiote&#39;s hosts are frequently strained, forced to hold to their convictions despite verbal and emotional abuse.

## Literature Review

Though Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s ultimate antagonist, the inclusion and threat of the Symbiote often makes the characters seem more real and relatable.




In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, the Symbiote, known as Venom when fully manifested, causes an extraordinary amount of physical, mental, and emotional damage to Peter Parker, Miles Morales, Harry Osborne, and Mary Jane Watson; however, its inclusion, and the effect it has on the game&#39;s main characters, often results in them doing or saying incredibly relatable things - many of which make their depictions all the more emotive and enjoyable. While the Symbiote corrupts its host, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s main characters seemingly try to make the most of a bad situation - perhaps for their own survival, but also for the wellbeing of those they care about.

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is a triumph of gameplay and storytelling, and quite possibly the best exclusive games yet to be released on PS5. Perhaps the highlight of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, from a narrative perspective, is the part that the Symbiote plays in the game&#39;s plot, and how the existential threat posed to the game&#39;s four main characters affects their personal character arcs, motivation, and behaviors - as well as their complex web of relationships.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.    


 The First &amp; Last Host Of Venom In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
Harry Osborn
         




In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Harry is shown to be remarkably fragile without the comfort blanket of the Symbiote - though this is perhaps a simplistic interpretation as the powers granted to him as Venom&#39;s host help him fend off his debilitating condition, it is, nevertheless, apt. After giving up the Symbiote to save Peter&#39;s life, Harry&#39;s health, both mental and physical, is shown to be in a state of rapid deterioration. Harry needs the Symbiote as much as it needs him - it affords him health and a sense of equality with his superhero friend, a fact that clearly is very important to him - as shown immediately after the Coney Island sequence.

Though not necessarily overtly jealous of Peter at the start of the game, after a while it is clear that he is resentful of his abilities, relationship with MJ, and even his bond with Norman Osborn, Harry&#39;s own father. Consequently, the Symbiote&#39;s ability to level the playing between the old friends affords Harry a sense of self-worth - a sense that he abruptly loses when the Symbiote refuses to return to him. Harry Osborne is a complex character who is deeply affected by his time with and without the Symbiote - not necessarily for the better, but it does make him a significantly relatable figure in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s roster of characters.






 Spider-Man Corrupted By The Venom Symbiote 
Peter Parker
         

The original Spider-Man, Peter Parker, has a significantly more personal interaction with the Symbiote than his web-slinging counterpart, Miles Morales. Peter is in the interestingly unique position of having first witnessed the Symbiote&#39;s powers before experiencing them. Unlike Harry&#39;s first time with the Symbiote, Peter is quickly corrupted by its influence and becomes an almost different person while playing host to it. Under the pressure of hosting the Symbiote, Peter becomes more aggressive and less compassionate to his friends and loved ones. This puts an enormous strain on his romantic relationship with MJ and his friendships with Miles and Harry.

Despite being a superhero, Peter Parker has always been a remarkably relatable figure in his movie, comic book, and video game depictions - Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is no exception. Despite this, his character in the latest Spider-Man game is made all the more relatable by the unfortunate period of time when he is deeply affected by the Symbiote suit. Although not the same, Peter&#39;s personality change under the symbiote influence is almost analogous to the personally pernicious effects of an addiction or other equally socially unhealthy habit. Peter is imbued with a personal demon that he, his friends, and his loved ones must, in a very literal way, fight to overcome.






 Scream As A Mouthpiece For Insecurities 
Mary Jane Watson
         

MJ is in the unfortunate position of seeing both her close friend and her romantic partner affected by the influence of the Symbiote Venom, as well as, at one time, being forced into the unenviable role of being the host of Scream, another Symbiote that spawns from Venom. Much like Venom, Scream manipulates its host&#39;s thoughts to justify its actions, preying on insecurities in particular. Throughout the Scream boss fight, MJ airs grievances about the difficulties of dating a superhero - the feelings of inadequacy, the reality of always coming second to Spider-Man&#39;s duties, and the stress of having a partner always in mortal peril.

In spite of this, throughout Spider-Man 2 MJ is made all the more relatable by her interactions with those currently and previously affected by the Symbiote. Unwaveringly supportive of both Peter and Harry, MJ works tirelessly to help those she cares about, even when they are less than appreciative, accepting, or accommodating - a thankless task that, at one time or another, all good friends have had to carry out.




Mary Jane suffers emotionally as much as, if not more than, any of the characters in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2; however, her primary concern seems to consistently be how the Symbiote is affecting those around her - as well as for their safety. As she is not a superhero (though Mary Jane gets powers in certain comics arcs), MJ is by far the most vulnerable main character during Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s final battle, though this does not prevent her from taking extraordinary risks to help Peter and Miles. Furthermore, as the only un-powered person in these moments, she experiences by far the most relatable set of emotions to regular people - fear, concern, and worry over her and her friends&#39; safety.



 A Good Friend In A Time Of Need 
Miles Morales
         

Miles Morales is perhaps the main character least affected by the Symbiote in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. At no point does he become the host of a Symbiote; however, he certainly does come into contact with the Symbiote, both while it possesses Harry and Peter. Miles&#39; most significant and relatable experience with the Symbiote comes during the boss battle between him and the Symbiote-controlled Peter. Miles has to viciously defeat his closest friend in order to help save him from himself under the influence of the Symbiote - an emotionally devastating thing to experience that shows just how extraordinarily close the Spider-Bros&#39; bond and friendship is.




Miles&#39; relationship with Peter, while he is under the influence of the Symbiote, is drastically strained; however, Miles refuses to let this period of hardship separate the two close friends - Miles goes as far as to defend Peter from Kraven, even after Peter has shown himself to be a temporarily terrible friend. In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Miles is incredibly relatable, especially during Peter&#39;s time as the Symbiote&#39;s host. He seemingly acknowledges that people go through tough times and will say, or do, inexcusable things to their closest friends during these difficult periods; however, Miles is always there for Peter, even when Peter, arguably, doesn&#39;t deserve his loyalty, compassion, or companionship.
