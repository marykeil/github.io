## Literature Review

Spider-Man 2 includes several new mechanics such as web wings or symbiote abilities, and one new web-based item is great for stealth approaches.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 includes several new mechanics to set the game apart from its predecessors, such as web wings for traversal, or the inclusion of symbiote abilities for Peter Parker. While the game does pare back the amount of gadgets that are available from previous entries, eschewing the gadget wheel selection menu for a more streamlined system, it does add a new item that can greatly improve stealth.

Over the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series, Peter Parker and Miles Morales can regularly be seen upgrading their costumes, training their abilities, or incorporating new items into their arsenal. While many of these are done by players via the games&#39; suit tech, gadgets, or skill trees, there are some that are included by default as part of the story, such as Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s new &#34;Web Line&#34;.

  


 Peter Transforms Hunter Technology Into Web Lines 
          

One of the main threats in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is Kraven and his army of hunters, who come to New York in search of &#34;worthy prey&#34; as part of their Great Hunt. This sees the group tracking down many classic Spider-Man villains, such as The Lizard and Scorpion. To do so, they have spent time researching the foes beforehand and have designed a great array of advanced tools and vehicles designed specifically to combat these superpowered beings.




When infiltrating their base during Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;Bad Guys On The Block&#34; main story mission, Peter comes across the hunters&#39; crossbows, which fire high-tensile cables for traversal and capturing foes. Upon studying it, Peter determines that the equipment is &#34;sturdy and flexible&#34; and has the idea to build a new tool that creates even stronger webs that can be walked along like tightropes.

 Web Lines Grant More Freedom Of Movement 
          

With these web lines, players are no longer dependent on using pre-existing beams or perches in bases to stealthily defeat enemies like they were in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales expanded upon this by allowing players to use walls and ceilings for takedowns as well. With web lines, players can create a point on the opposite wall either on a level, or at an incline or decline, and can use these tightropes to make their own paths high above their opponents.




While on a web line, it&#39;s possible to attach another web line to that point on the pre-existing one, creating even more variety as the Spider-Men essentially create a giant web above their unaware enemies. By doing so, it makes Peter and Miles work almost like real spiders would by moving across strands and ensnaring their &#34;prey&#34; in their web.



 Web Lines Are Great For Stealth Sections 
          

This freedom of movement with web lines is particularly useful for the Hunter Base missions across the city. Hunter Bases are unlocked after completing a series of Hunter Blinds. While Hunter Blinds are usually outdoors and are found on rooftops but are hidden with cloaking mechanisms, Hunter Bases tend to involve navigating large interiors in abandoned warehouses or buildings.

A full-on assault is often a more fatal option for these bases unless players have unlocked enhanced abilities like the symbiote, or have upgraded their suit tech to allow for more damage and health beforehand. Therefore, using web lines allows perch almost anywhere in the base above their foes and pull them up for a takedown. With enemies rarely looking up to see their cocooned allies hanging from a thread above them, this makes for a far easier and more varied approach to stealth than before.






While most enemies won&#39;t look up, they may spot Spider-Man moving on a web line if it descends to their eye level.




Peter and Miles may need to drop to ground level to accomplish the Hunter Base&#39;s optional side objectives, which can&#39;t be performed once the base has been cleared. Miles can use his invisibility power for this, but Peter runs a high chance of getting caught by nearby foes. Fortunately, preparing a web line directly above the objective grants an easy place to escape to, as each line has several points that can be web-zipped to with ease, ensuring that players can get the most out of these Hunter Bases before they disappear from the map (at least until Mission Replay and New Game Plus are added to the game).

                  All Hunter Blinds Locations In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Hunter Blinds are staging points for Kraven&#39;s sinister plans in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. It&#39;s up to Peter and Miles to take them and their bases out.    






 Spider-Man Can Strike Classic Poses On Web Lines 
         

When not in a base or an interior location, the web lines can also be used in the game&#39;s open world to create paths between buildings. This is nowhere near as fast as web-zipping or other forms of traversal, however, it has sparked the imagination of players who are able to create classic Spider-Man poses with the web-lines via the game&#39;s photo mode.

Photo mode has always been a popular addition to the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series for the purpose of recreating iconic moments from other Spider-Man media, or capturing impressive feats within gameplay. One new addition to the photo mode that wasn&#39;t in previous Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games is the option to pose the playable character. The new &#34;Character Mode&#34; is equipped with a series of selected poses based on some of Spider-Man&#39;s more iconic visuals across media.






Character Mode also has various facial expressions for more photo customization.




There are specific moves unlocked depending on whether Spider-Man is swinging through the air, or standing on the ground, and perching on a web line counts as the latter. Therefore, players can now make Peter or Miles lie down on a giant web resembling a hammock that&#39;s been spun across Times Square, or crouch in the center of the web with lines emanating from them in all directions like the sewer scene in 2012&#39;s The Amazing Spider-Man.

Initially, the web line mechanic could have seemed like a knock-off of the Line Launcher gadget seen in the Batman: Arkham games. However, the option to link web lines together to create a giant web does make it a far more versatile tool as it branches off in multiple directions, and one that seems far more fitting for Spider-Man, and for those who prefer stealthy approaches to situations, it&#39;s one of the better additions to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and the series going forward.
