## Literature Review

Sand Land, a hilarious action RPG based on the 2000 manga by Akira Toriyama, is coming soon. Hereâ€™s everything to know about the upcoming release.




Sand Land is an upcoming RPG from the mind of Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball and longtime character designer for the Dragon Quest series. It&#39;s based on a 14-chapter manga originally released in 2000, but it&#39;s not the only upcoming adaptation: following a CGI Sand Land film last year, there&#39;s also a Sand Land streaming series scheduled for late 2024. The Sand Land manga and film have all the hallmarks of Toriyama&#39;s work: singular character design, off-the-wall humor, and epic battles.




However, Sand Land is decidedly distinct from Dragon Ball and Dragon Quest, in both its short and sweet nature and its gleefully cynical tone. Still, Sand Land is a lot of fun, even if it comes with the occasional gut punch of difficult reality. It&#39;s cute and silly, but also poignant and memorable. It might be the best Toriyama game adaptation fans could hope for. Whatever it is, Sand Land is coming soon.

 Sand Land: Release Date &amp; Platforms 
          

The Sand Land video game is scheduled for release worldwide on April 26, 2024 - although players in Japan will get access to it one day early. This is remarkably soon after its initial announcement at Summer Game Fest 2023, coming out less than a year after the initial reveal. It&#39;s already available for pre-order on all platforms, and via many major game retailers.




Thankfully, Sand Land won&#39;t be a PS6 exclusive. At launch, Sand Land will be available on multiple platforms, both current generation and previous: PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S versions have already been confirmed. While PlayStation users will be able to purchase Sand Land regardless of whether they&#39;ve upgraded to a PS5, there&#39;s no word on a release for Xbox One yet. The same goes for Switch players, although since Dragon Quest 11 eventually came to that platform, too, there&#39;s still hope.



 Sand Land: Story Details 
          

The release date trailer for Sand Land, uploaded to YouTube on January 11, 2024, reveals significant details about the game&#39;s story. While it appears to cleave pretty closely to the original manga, the game might&#39;ve taken more inspiration from the recent movie&#39;s plot. It also has one or two new tricks up its sleeve.





 

As its name implies, Sand Land is set in a vast, desert wasteland, several decades after a cataclysmic war and a series of natural disasters wiped out most of the world&#39;s water. It stars the diminutive demon Beelzebub. The son of Lucifer and Prince of Hell, he makes a habit of stealing what he can from humans, but is kind enough only to take as much water as he and his subjects require.

Beelzebub meets up with Rao, the general responsible for ordering one of the war&#39;s worst atrocities: the Aquanium Explosion, which has left an enormous crater in the earth. Rao swears vengeance against his former liege, a tyrannical ruler simply called King. King controls all of Sand Land, by virtue of holding a large water supply under his thumb. He charges exorbitant prices for bottled water, and those who can&#39;t afford them are left to languish in thirst. Witnessing the horrors of King&#39;s reign firsthand, Rao seeks out the Legendary Spring, a seemingly infinite source of water that may or may not truly exist, and Beelzebub comes along for the ride.




The Sand Land video game features a new character: the master mechanic Ann, who helps Beelzebub and Rao construct tanks to fend off King&#39;s army. Together with the aptly-named Thief, the ragtag group streaks across the desert, fighting infantry, mechs, and giant monsters as they search for a way to free Sand Land&#39;s people from King&#39;s terrible rule. The Sand Land game may include a few changes, but if early trailers are to be believed, it also captures the spirit of the original manga and its film adaptation. It&#39;s a goofy, thrilling story with just a hint of desperation, a handful of twists, and an inspiring, triumphant moral.



 Sand Land: Gameplay Details 
         

Like Dragon Quest before it, Sand Land is an RPG - but unlike Dragon Quest, it features real-time action combat. Some of this takes place on foot, with Beelzebub using rapid-fire punches, flurried kicks, and powerful throws to knock enemy heads together. It&#39;s unknown whether any other party members will have their own abilities, or whether Beelzebub will be the sole playable character - only Beelzebub&#39;s combat combos have been shown off in trailers so far.




But Sand Land really sets itself apart in the wide variety of vehicles and mounts available for players to pilot. Cars, bikes, tanks, mechs, hovercraft, and dinosaurs are all on the menu. Different vehicles appear to have different abilities: for example, one tank can be seen firing lasers, while a giant robot emits sonic blasts. Sand Land&#39;s vehicles also appear to be customizable to some extent. Players can select the colors, patterns, and weapons equipped by their in-game vehicles.

Beelzebub, Rao, Ann, and Thief will make their way around a vast, colorful world, navigating the open wilds of the desert, the treacherous ruins of once-great cities, and the teeming masses of desert settlements. They&#39;ll come up against King&#39;s soldiers and desert raiders, souped-up tanks and well-oiled mechs. Giant monsters will pose a threat from time to time, including one who looks suspiciously similar to the King Squid boss from the Dragon Quest series. Sand Land also includes a base-building mechanic, in which resources gathered throughout the game can be used to improve Beelzebub and company&#39;s home turf.






 Sand Land: Pricing, Editions, &amp; Pre-Order Bonuses 
Sand Land Standard, Deluxe, &amp; Collector&#39;s Edition Differences
         

At launch, Sand Land will be available in three editions: the Standard Edition, the Deluxe Edition, and the Collector&#39;s Bundle. The Standard Edition comes with the game alone, but those who pre-order it will receive a bonus set of in-game skins. That&#39;s the Survivalist Camo Pack, featuring three multicolored camouflage paint jobs that can be applied to various vehicles. The Standard Edition of Sand Land retails at $59.99 USD regardless of platform, and is available in both physical and digital formats.

For $69.99 USD, players gain access to the Deluxe Edition of Sand Land, which includes the Survivalist Camo Pack for pre-orders, along with an additional set of five in-game decals that can be used to decorate vehicles. The Deluxe Edition also comes with the Speed Demon Pack, consisting of six consumable items and a handful of customizable tank weapons, and a few free sets of furniture for customizing the home base. The Deluxe Edition is only available for PC via digital download.




Finally, the Collector&#39;s Edition of Sand Land costs $129.99 USD. It also includes the Survivalist Camo Pack if pre-ordered, but uniquely comes with an exclusive Figuarts figurine, featuring Beelzebub standing triumphantly atop a pillar of rock. The Collector&#39;s Edition is only available with physical copies of Sand Land for PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S - digital downloads aren&#39;t included.

And that&#39;s all there is to know about Sand Land, at least for now. More details about the gameplay, story, and new characters are sure to be revealed closer to release. Between its action combat, over-the-top story, and classically Toriyama visual style, it promises to be an exciting and amusing experience. Sand Land will be out worldwide on April 26, 2024.
