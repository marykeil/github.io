## Literature Review

It&#39;s easy to miss a few things in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, which can end up making progression feel less rewarding if left uncorrected.




Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora throws a lot of different systems and mechanics around over the course of a playthrough, and it can be a little easy to miss out on some when they first become available. Familiarity with Ubisoft franchises like Far Cry definitely goes a long way, but Frontiers of Pandora does add some complexities and offbeat gameplay elements that aren&#39;t present in prior games from the publisher. It&#39;s usually easy enough to figure everything out sooner or later, but confusion isn&#39;t exactly beneficial to the overall experience.
The less obvious mechanics of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora apply to a variety of gameplay elements, from general exploration to combat. It&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora doesn&#39;t belabor every point, as bogging down an open-world game with heavy tutorialization can take the wind out of its sails all too quickly. Brushing up on all the details, however, can make it easier to pay less attention to figuring things out, enhancing the immersive aspect of wandering the wilds of Pandora.
            
 
 &#34;A Staggering Sensory Experience&#34; - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review 
Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.












 








 10  Looting Enemy Ammo 
Fallen Mechs Are The Perfect Way To Get Ammo
        

Ammo for Na&#39;vi weapons can be crafted from basic resources throughout Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, but human weapons aren&#39;t as easily refilled. The best trick is to always run by any downed mechs, as doing so will resupply some bullets or shells. Looting RDA sites also tends to provide some ammo, and occasionally some special alternate fire options that are more effective in a tight spot.





 9  Raising Clan Favor 
Contributions And Quests Can Max Out Favor
        

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora explains how raising Na&#39;vi clan favor works, but it&#39;s easy to get a little too concerned about conserving the resource early on. Favor ends up being generally easy to earn through side quests, contributions, and more, and maxing it out will mean any reputation earned while the meter is full will go to waste. It&#39;s a good idea to spend favor whenever any particular piece of equipment is lagging behind, or simply make use of it for whatever strikes a player&#39;s fancy.





 8  Petting An Ikran 
Ikrans Need Love In Frontiers Of Pandora


 







The ikran&#39;s job doesn&#39;t have to be thankless, as it&#39;s fully possible to show it affection by petting it on the nose. Standing in front of a bonded ikran for a moment should cause the prompt to pet it to appear, so it&#39;s a very easy-to-use mechanic in general. The feature can be easy to miss simply because the prompt doesn&#39;t tend to show up when running up to an ikran, so it&#39;s easy to mount one and take off over and over without ever realizing there&#39;s another option.

An Ikran is a massive winged creature that you can find and fly as a mount in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, letting you explore the world in new ways.








 7  Stashing Extra Items 
Storage Can Be Found All Over Pandora
        

Some great upgrades to pick in the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora skill tree are the Expert Forager options under the Memories of the Maker category, as these add extra inventory space for cooking and crafting supplies. Even with the skills maxed out, however, it&#39;s easy to run up against the limit. The good thing to know is that storage baskets can be found in a wider variety of locations than some other functions, with Field Labs providing a particularly convenient way to jettison some extras while on the go.





 6  Raising Combat Strength Rating 
Combat Strength Rating Can Be Vague


 







The core function of the combat rating in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is straightforward – better gear means a higher number, which shows how well-equipped the protagonist is to deal with any given mission in the game. Understanding its nuances is a little more complicated, however. The main things to note are that an exclamation mark indicates the need to increase combat strength in Frontiers of Pandora, and that the number isn&#39;t infallible, as sometimes it will raise or lower the rating based on abilities that don&#39;t have any real bearing on battle.





 5  Harvesting Plants At The Right Time 
Environmental Conditions Have A Big Impact
        

Picking the right time to gather is important in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, as many resources will have their quality affected by environmental conditions. More importantly, certain plants won&#39;t even be accessible depending on the weather or time of day. The rain thistle is one such example, which, true to its name, will only open up to allow its bounty to be harvested when it&#39;s raining in the surrounding area.

Some tasks in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora can be a bit repetitive, but one smart choice helps a core element feel more rewarding than usual. 








 4  Cooking Has Complex Benefits 
Effects Can Be Heavily Tweaked


 







The basic advantage of cooking in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is obvious, as fighting on a full stomach will allow health to recharge while draining the resource. Taking true advantage of cooking, however, requires paying attention to the unique stat bonuses of each ingredient and meal to figure out the best recipes in Frontiers of Pandora. Early on, this may not seem like a big deal, but specific scenarios later in the game can make it highly useful. One highly situational option that proves to be excellent when needed is the buff that prevents poison damage, which can quickly render areas deadly otherwise.





 3  Fast Travel Takes Energy 
Ikran Stamina Is Reduced When Fast Traveling
        

Selecting a fast travel option on the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora map makes it clear that taking a shortcut will expend resources, with a reduction quotient next to the symbol of an ikran. If this seems confusing at all, the answer is simple – the resource being drained is ikran stamina. This isn&#39;t a particularly big deal, as it isn&#39;t that hard to recharge, although overusing fast travel will ultimately take away from the exploration of Pandora as a whole.
One Ancestor Skill makes fast travel free, although it&#39;s nowhere near the starting position on the map. 






 2  Swapping Cosmetics 
Hair, Body Paint, &amp; More Can Be Changed
        

Although most customization features and items earned in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora can be accessed at virtually any time through the standard menu, key alterations to the protagonist&#39;s appearance aren&#39;t as easily accessible. The secret is found at Changing Places, which look vaguely like more organic versions of sinks. These can be found in major Na&#39;vi settlements, although it might take a bit of poking around sometimes.





 1  Getting Stamina From Swarms 
Ikran Can Refuel Mid-Flight
        

One tidbit that&#39;s easy to miss is that ikrans can replenish stamina by flying through swarms of smaller creatures in the air, an easy technique to conserve meat that doesn&#39;t tend to take much effort. Another good option is swooping in low over bodies of water to allow an ikran to skim the surface and snatch fish. Using both of these can alleviate concerns about speccing into ikran stamina boosts in the skill tree, which end up being less necessary than many other options in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
