## Literature Review

There are several Pokémon across many generations that were once human. Here are some of the best so far - including some creepy ones.




According to official Pokémon lore, there are several Pokémon that were once human in the franchise. This extends from older Generation 1 creatures all the way to more recent additions to the series. Players who read the games’ texts thoroughly already know that there are several terrifying Pokédex entries in Pokémon, as well as some very odd ones. By reading these small descriptions of certain species throughout the franchise’s many years, it is possible to discover that, for instance, the beautiful Gorebyss is actually a cruel creature that drains the body fluids from its prey’s body until nothing but a husk is left.
Alternatively, Greavard has one of the saddest Pokédex entries in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, mentioning that this is the reborn spirit of a wild dog that never interacted with a human. There is much to learn about the world of Pokémon by reading Pokédex entries, and some of these bits of information actually reveal that there are species that were once human and somehow became twisted into creatures. A few of these are less impressive than others, but some are absolutely sinister – so much so that their entire existence lies in the fact that they were once human.
 : 10 Regional Pokémon That Make Zero Sense









 








 10  Gastly 
First appearance: Red &amp; Green


 







One of the first Pokémon to actually have been human is Gastly. While this Gen 1 Pokémon is decades old, the first mention of it having souls as a component of its body happened in Gen 7. In the Ultra Sun Pokédex entry registered by Bulbapedia, it is said that the gas emanating from a graveyard was possessed by grievances of the deceased, thus becoming Gastly.
To further back that information, the Ultra Moon Pokédex entry states that, while 95% of its body is made of poisonous gas, the remaining 5% are souls of those who deceased from it. It seems like, while Gastly is mostly composed of gas, as it has been since its release, part of its existence relies on human souls.





 9  Sandygast 
First appearance: Sun &amp; Moon
        

Another human-based Pokémon is Sandygast, which was only introduced Gen 7. Although the Sun Pokédex registered by Bulbapedia entry mentions it has a connection to deceased humans, this only becomes more apparent in the Ultra Moon entry. The game states that Sandygast is the result of a sand mound becoming possessed after being left.
In Gen 8, Sandygast’s Pokédex entry in Pokémon Sword mentions that what possesses this mound is a collective number of grudges of the dead. The most likely species to hold grudges are humans, therefore, this creature once had a human form, before becoming a sentient pile of sand.





 8  Gengar 
First appearance: Red &amp; Green
        

One of the most popular creatures in the series, Gengar, was also once a human. The final evolution to Gastly is mostly known for casting curses and haunting others – in addition to making environments colder. Nevertheless, there is a mention of its humanoid form in the Moon entry registered by Bulbapedia.
Gengar’s description in the game says that it looks for a traveling companion and that such a search is fueled by the fact that it was once a human itself. Unfortunately, it ends up taking the lives of humans when it tries to find a buddy to travel alongside.





 7  Honedge 
First appearance: X &amp; Y
        

Yet another Ghost-type Pokémon that was once human, Honedge has no notable humanoid characteristics. Most of its Pokédex entries mention this connection. In Pokémon X’s entry, according to Bulbapedia, players can learn that Honedge is actually a sword possessed by a human spirit.
This same information is backed up by the Gen 6 remake Omega Ruby, which shares the same Pokédex entry as Pokémon X. In Gen 7’s Pokémon Sword, Honedge’s connection to its previous human life is further developed, with the game stating that its soul once belonged to a person who was killed by the sword that composes the Pokémon’s body.





 6  Drifloon 
First appearance: Diamond &amp; Pearl


 







While Drifloon is mostly known for the fact that it tries to carry away wandering children, its Pokédex entries also reveal that it was once human. According to its entry in Pokémon Diamond, the first game in which it appeared, Drifloon is formed by the spirits of people and Pokémon. This information is registered by Bulbapedia.
In Gen 6, the Ghost-type’s entry in the Ultra Moon Pokédex then states that wandering souls gathered together to form Drifloon. Later on, in Gen 8, the Pokémon’s entry in Legends: Arceus states that unconfirmed rumors point to Drifloon being formed by reincarnated human souls.





 5  Kadabra 
First appearance: Red &amp; Green
        

One of the very few Pokémon that was once a human and is not a Ghost-type, Kadabra has its origins in a tragic tale. Although it has existed since Gen 1, it was only in Gen 3’s Pokémon Emerald that it had its human origin confirmed. As seen in the entry registered by Bulbapedia, there are rumors that Kadabra is actually a boy with psychic abilities who was suddenly transformed when assisting in research into his extrasensory powers.
The FireRed entry says that the boy with powers one day awoke already transformed into Kadabra. This detail was then largely ignored for three generations, only to reappear in Pokémon Sun, when it is mentioned that the boy could not control his powers and was transformed. This origin story also made its way into Gen 8 via Kadabra’s entry in Legends: Arceus.





 4  Phantump 
First appearance: X &amp; Y
        

While most human-based Pokémon tend to be vague when it comes to their origin, Phantump takes it up a notch in terms of creepiness. According to the creature’s Pokédex entry in Pokémon Y, registered by Bulbapedia, Phantump is actually a tree stump that was possessed by the spirit of a child who died while lost in the forest.
This grim origin also reflects on the Pokémon itself. As seen in Pokédex entries in Ultra Sun and Shield, for instance, Phantump imitates the voice of a human child – which would be explained by the fact that it is actually the spirit of a human child. Phantump is, however, a benevolent spirit, who is only searching for friends, according to Pokémon Violet.





 3  Spiritomb 
First appearance: Diamond &amp; Pearl


 







Spiritomb is, possibly, the most well-known Pokémon to have been created from humans. Since its debut in Gen 4, how it is formed has been discussed. In its Pokédex entry in Pokémon Diamond, according to Bulbapedia, Spiritomb is said to be the collective form of 108 souls combined.
According to several other entries in the series, Spiritomb is bound to a fissure in an Odd Keystone, as a way of punishing its constant mischief and misdeeds 500 years ago. While it is known that Spiritomb is made out of 108 souls, it is uncertain what caused these souls to come together and form it. Pokémon Sword mentions that there are ill-natured spirits in the mix, while Legends: Arceus’ entry simply adds that Spiritomb lays curses by thinking wicked thoughts.





 2  Yamask 
First appearance: Black &amp; White
        

Yamask is one of the creepiest Pokémon in the series and has had its connection to its previous human form established since its debut in Gen 5’s Black and White. According to its entry in Black, as seen on Bulbapedia, Yamask carries around a mask that was once their human face, and they often look at it and cry. The crying is somewhat explained in Pokémon White’s entry, as it states that all Yamask retain the memories of their former lives.
As such, these creatures that arose from the spirits of people in graves in past ages are likely aware that they were once human, now bound to battle for the pleasure of other humans. Pokémon Shield mentions that Yamask wanders around ruins in search of someone who recognizes their face, making their existence both sad and dreadful.





 1  Froslass 
First appearance: Diamond &amp; Pearl
        

The female evolution of Snorunt, Froslass, is also a Pokémon that was once a human. The Gen 4 creature has had its connection to a previous humanoid form since Gen 4, but only with HeartGold and SoulSilver. In the remake’s Pokédex entries, according to Bulbapedia, Frosslass was a woman who died on an icy mountain after becoming lost. Its entry in Moon mentions that the woman’s soul possessed an icicle, thus becoming Froslass, while Legends: Arceus mentions that the woman died bearing a grudge.
If that were not enough, Froslass is creepy. If it finds humans or Pokémon it likes, it freezes them and uses them as decorations in its den, as seen in Sun’s Pokédex. Additionally, it hunts down people, as it relishes the frozen souls of men. Froslass is not only a creature to have been a human in a past life, but also one of the scariest monsters in the entire Pokémon franchise.
