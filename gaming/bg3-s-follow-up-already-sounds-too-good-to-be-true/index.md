# BG3 s Follow-Up Already Sounds Too Good To Be True


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has impressed players with its wide variety of character choices, deep customization, and intricate mechanics.   Larian&#39;s CEO Swen Vincke has promised to &#34;push boundaries&#34; with the next big game, but it is too early to know what it will be or if it will live up to expectations.   The next game could be another Baldur&#39;s Gate, another Divinity, or something else entirely.

## Literature Review

Larian has promised big things after Baldur’s Gate 3, but is it too early to make that kind of guarantee? Here’s what could be coming next.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is great, but its developers have already promised its follow-up will be better. The way players have rallied around BG3 since its release is incredible, but not unexpected. There&#39;s just so much to be surprised by: a wide variety of good and evil character choices, a staggering degree of character customization, and seemingly simple mechanics that go impossibly deep. People are still finding new secrets, new ways to play, and new contingencies for when they try to break Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. And through it all, developers at Larian have listened to and incorporated player feedback to create a welcoming, universally enjoyable experience.




It all adds up to an impressive final product, and one that&#39;s earned Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 eight nominations at The Game Awards. Even still, Larian isn&#39;t planning on resting on its laurels. It&#39;s still working on an Xbox release for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and according to its higher-ups, it&#39;s already got something big planned for its next game, whatever that might be. But it&#39;s still early days, and these kinds of pre-development promises don&#39;t always pan out. Here&#39;s what they say, and what that might mean for BG3&#39;s follow-up.

 Larian Wants To &#34;Push Boundaries&#34; 
According To Founder &amp; CEO Swen Vincke
          

Responding to its many TGA nominations on X (formerly Twitter), Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke claimed that the critical reception to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has encouraged the development team to &#34;push many boundaries&#34; with its next big game. Of course, Vincke declined to say what that next game will be, and it&#39;ll probably be a while before he or anyone else at Larian reveals anything more. If anyone&#39;s to be trusted about what&#39;s next for Larian, it&#39;s Vincke. Not only is he a primary source, but he&#39;s also the director of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and many of Larian&#39;s prior games, so it seems likely he&#39;ll fill a similar role on the next one.





 

However, it seems too early to be making such a promise. To say such a thing so early can cause fan speculation to run wild, which could cause the end product to be a disappointment, no matter what it is. And given how many boundaries BG3 has already broken, one has to wonder what&#39;s left. Here&#39;s a look at a few things that Larian&#39;s next big game could be, for better or worse.



 Larian&#39;s Next Game Could Be A Reskinned BG3 
          

Larian&#39;s next game could just rehash much of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. It may do so as the next installment in the Baldur&#39;s Gate series, or as a completely original title, but one way or another might bring back systems, mechanics, and ideas from the previous game. Of course, it would likely take place around new scenarios, characters, and locations.




That might not be the worst thing. If it has the same care and attention put into its design, a simple sequel to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 could be just as good, although there&#39;s little likelihood that it&#39;d be better. It&#39;d probably include a handful of new options for character creation and progression, making some of the missing races from Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 available alongside new feats, subclasses, spells, and equippable gear. Another adventure in the Forgotten Realms or a similar world would be nice, but it&#39;d be a bit of a letdown after Vincke&#39;s announcement.



 Larian&#39;s Next Big Game Could Be Divinity 3 
         

There&#39;s also the possibility that Larian&#39;s next game could be the long-awaited next installment in the Divinity series. This was Larian&#39;s big franchise before Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and while it&#39;s similar in many ways, Divinity and Baldur&#39;s Gate are very different. The series started as a Diablo-esque action RPG, but its most recent game, 2017&#39;s Divinity: Original Sin 2, is pretty much everything a BG3 precursor could be expected to be. It has a similar system of combat, player freedom, and story choices - playing it now, it almost feels like an audition for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. But it has its own setting and systems, and is decidedly distinct.




So, if it does have something to do with Divinity, the question is: would Larian&#39;s next big game be Divinity: Original Sin 3, or just a brand-new Divinity? A new game in the Original Sin subseries would basically be like a reskinned BG3, just with a different setting and some changes to its roleplaying systems. But if it followed in the steps of older Divinity games, it might return to that Diablo style of action gameplay. It&#39;d certainly be interesting to see how Larian applies its unique storytelling approach to a loot-based ARPG, and would definitely break boundaries in that genre.



 Larian&#39;s Next Game Could Be Completely Different 
          

Of course, there&#39;s always the possibility that Larian&#39;s next game will come completely out of left field, existing in an entirely different genre. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time they&#39;ve made something other than an RPG - the Divinity spin-off Dragon Commander was a real-time strategy game, but that was a long time ago. Still, it&#39;d be a curious format for Larian to revive, and it&#39;d be interesting to see what its attention to detail and penchant for complicated systems could do for the RTS genre.




A pure, modern-style ARPG isn&#39;t out of the question, either - imagine a Larian Soulslike, with that level of story detail. That would be a departure from the genre&#39;s usual approach to story, keeping true to Vincke&#39;s promise to break boundaries. With Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 prioritizing co-op multiplayer, Larian could take that even further in an MMORPG. MMO storytelling doesn&#39;t tend to incorporate much player choice, with the most obvious reason that such variations can create paradoxical stories. It&#39;d be interesting to see how Larian tackles that obstacle, and sharing odd details and Easter eggs with other players would be easier than ever before.

But at this point, it&#39;s too early to tell. Larian&#39;s next game is a mystery, but with the same team behind it, it has a major advantage. BG3&#39;s success means all eyes are on Larian, a prospect that Vincke, in replies to the above Twitter thread, calls frightening. It&#39;s only because he&#39;s built up so much goodwill with the success of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but expectations can be a hindrance as much as they can be a help.
