## Literature Review

A new mission in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update shows Johnny Silverhand and his band, Samurai still have some die-hard fans in Night City.




A Cyberpunk 2077 Easter egg has revealed a creepy obsession with the ex-soldier and Rockerboy, Johnny Silverhand. Despite dying in 2023, 54 years prior to the events of V&#39;s story in the game, Silverhand and his band, Samurai still have some die-hard fans in Night City, even if some of the younger generation seem to show little interest.




Silverhand is one of the main characters V interacts with throughout Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s story, as the deceased rockstar rebel&#39;s engram is on the prototype version of the Relic embedded in V&#39;s head and is gradually killing them. Through flashbacks and conversations with Silverhand, players learn about his backstory, goals, enemies, and alliances, many of whom return to assist V or cause them trouble in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s narrative.

                  All Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 Changes, Updates, And Details   Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.1 update will add a lot of changes to the game, including a metro system, accessibility features, car chases, and much more.   


 Cyberpunk 2.1&#39;s Update Included A Unique New Car 
Buying The Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet (930) Unlocks A Mission
          

The new 2.1 update added many features to Cyberpunk 2077 when it was released alongside the game&#39;s Ultimate Edition on December 5th, 2023. These features included harder boss battles, the option to travel via the NCART metro, hang out with love interests at one of V&#39;s apartments, and play the radio stations on the go, rather than being limited to vehicle journeys.






The NCART metro was part of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s original marketing but wasn&#39;t originally included at launch.




Alongside these new features came replayable races, and new vehicles to purchase from the AUTOFIXER points across the city. While normally, purchasing vehicles this way unlocks them instantly for the players, trying to purchase the new Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet (930) unlocks a new mission called &#34;Shape of a Pony&#34; instead, in which fixer Muamar &#34;El Capitan&#34; Reyes informs V that this car hasn&#39;t been delivered, and is likely stolen.



The Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet (930) costs €$73,000, and is a Cabriolet version of the vehicle owned by Johnny Silverhand.




                  Cyberpunk 2077: Johnny Silverhand Interactions You Probably Missed   Everyone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 will spend a lot of time with Johnny - but some players might accidentally overlook his best moments.   






 The Car&#39;s Previous Owner Had A Creepy Obsession With Johnny Silverhand 
The Fan Changed His Appearance To Look Like The Rockerboy
          

Upon heading to the last known location of the Porsche, players discover the body of its former owner, Johnny Silverman, a Samurai superfan who took his obsession to extreme lengths. As well as sharing a strikingly similar name - although this was almost definitely changed due to his fandom, rather than being his birth name - Silverman owned a modified version of Johnny Silverhand&#39;s car and augmented his body with Cyberware to look like the Samurai frontman, to the extent that Silverhand himself says he has &#34;Deja vu&#34; looking at it.

Unfortunately, someone found out that Silverman was selling his unique car and killed him for it. Upon finding this out, V has to track the thieves down to finally unlock it in their inventory. Despite his appearance, Silverman&#39;s obsession with Samurai seemingly came to an end a little while before his death as a new one with the Lazrpop band, Us Cracks, developed. This was likely due to the group&#39;s cover of former Samurai guitarist and vocalist Kerry Eyrodyne&#39;s ballad &#34;User Friendly&#34;.






Depending on V&#39;s actions in Cyberpunk 2077, Kerry and Us Cracks can collaborate to make a new single called &#34;Off the Leash&#34;.




Despite Samurai and Johnny Silverhand&#39;s time being over half a century ago by the time Cyberpunk 2077 takes place, Easter eggs like Johnny Silverman, and the band&#39;s reunion concert in the game show that they do still resonate with fans. Considering the band&#39;s anti-Corpo messages, which are still relevant in 2077, this is hardly surprising, even if Silverman&#39;s show of appreciation for the group&#39;s frontman is rather excessive.
