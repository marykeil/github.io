## Literature Review

Terrakion is one of 25 Legendary Pokémon available for catching as part of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk&#39;s post-game, but it requires an item.





Essentially, Snacksworth is willing to exchange Legendary Pokémon snacks in exchange for completing Solo BBQs and Group BBQs in Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. While speaking with him, he will instruct how many more BBQs must be completed for the next snack, and for those who have already started, he will hand out whatever has been earned thus far. 




                  Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests   In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.

Legendary Pokémon Treats are essential for catching the Legendary Pokémon in Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, as they will not spawn without it. There are 25 in total, and players will not be able to choose which one they receive next, but they must have that Pokémon&#39;s Treat in their inventory for it to spawn in the wild. For Terrakion, Pokémon Violet players will need to complete Solo BBQs, while Pokémon Scarlet players will need to complete Group BBQs to receive the snack.




Once players have received the Terrakion Treat from Snacksworth, he will provide a little riddle that gives clues about where Terrakion can be found. Note that all Legendary Pokémon will be found back in Paldea, which helps narrow the search. With the Terrakion Treat in hand, this Pokémon will spawn in the wild once in the correct location, so head back to Paldea to begin the search.



Be sure to save before attempting to catch Terrakion or any Legendary Pokémon so that you may restart if they accidentally faint before they can be captured. They will eventually respawn if you forget to do this, but not for several hours, and time-jumping is not recommended.




The best fast travel point will be Cascarrafa City, on the western side of the Great Crater of Paldea. The exact spot where Terrakion will spawn is a small cliff ledge directly southeast of the Team Star area south of Cascarrafa City. Jump up onto this ledge, and Terrakion should spawn directly in the center of it, ready to be caught. However, be sure you have enough Pokéballs on hand, as catching any Legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC is no easy feat.
