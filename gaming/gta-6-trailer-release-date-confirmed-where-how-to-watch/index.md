## Literature Review

Rockstar Games has finally announced the release date for Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s first trailer. Here&#39;s when and where it will be available to watch.




Rockstar Games has finally announced the release date for Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s first trailer. The studio&#39;s president, Sam Houser previously revealed that the highly anticipated reveal trailer would drop sometime in December 2023 as part of Rockstar Games&#39; 25th Anniversary celebrations.




The Rockstar Games X account posted an image confirming that the trailer would be revealed on Tuesday, December 5 at 9am ET. Previously, Rockstar has shared its reveal trailers for major titles such as Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 on its official Rockstar Games YouTube account, and on the Rockstar Games website, where the post was also shared.


 


 Many Speculated That GTA 6&#39;s Trailer Would Be At The Game Awards 
GTA 6&#39;s Reveal Will Be Two Days Prior
          

When Hauser previously revealed a December 2023 release date for GTA 6&#39;s first trailer, many speculated that it would be revealed as part of The Game Awards that month. While Rockstar has previously revealed its current-gen version of GTA 5 at showcases such as Sony&#39;s State of Play, the studio has tended to keep its major trailer reveals separate, so releasing GTA 6&#39;s trailer two days prior to The Game Awards is in keeping with the company&#39;s track record.




                  Now&#39;s The Perfect Time For A Rockstar Games Showcase   With the amount of hype surrounding Rockstar Games titles, particularly GTA 6, now is the perfect time for the company to present its own showcase.   



 What Can Fans Expect From GTA 6&#39;s First Trailer? 
Rockstar&#39;s Revamped Vice City Will Likely Be The Focus
          

From Rockstar&#39;s previous reveal trailers for GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA 6&#39;s first trailer will probably show off some impressive landscapes from Rockstar&#39;s revamped Vice City. The location had previously been seen in the 80s-centric GTA: Vice City and GTA: Vice City Stories, and was revealed to be the location of Rockstar&#39;s upcoming title in a major leak last year. The official trailer announcement has a background that heavily hints at the fictional Floridian location, confirming this will be GTA 6&#39;s main setting.




It&#39;s also highly likely that the GTA 6 trailer will give players their first official look at its long-rumored Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo, Lucia and Jason. While Rockstar&#39;s reveal trailers for GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 didn&#39;t go into too much detail about the characters and their story, they did include voiceover narration alongside the visuals to give players a sense of the protagonists&#39; personalities.

Coming over a decade since the launch of the franchise&#39;s previous title, Grand Theft Auto 6 is one of if not the most highly anticipated titles in gaming right now. Hopefully, with its imminent reveal, players won&#39;t have to wait too much longer before they can get their hands on the game itself.
