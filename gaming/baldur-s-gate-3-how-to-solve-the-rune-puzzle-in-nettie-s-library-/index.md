## Literature Review

The Emerald Grove in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a secret puzzle involving runes that you can solve in Nettie&#39;s Library to earn two rare rewards during Act 1.





Your party can reach Emerald Grove after you defeat a group of goblins attacking the gate leading into the sanctuary near the Nautiloid crash. The uneasy alliance held by Tiefling refugees and the druids of the Grove makes up a good portion of the early story in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. While there are many hidden secrets in Act 1, this location is almost impossible to avoid as you begin your adventure.




                  BG3: One Act 1 Decision Is The Most Disturbing Way To Deal With Emerald Grove   It&#39;s easy for the Emerald Grove situation in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to end in violence, but one specific method has the most horrific results.   


 How to Unlock Nettie&#39;s Library 
          

Nettie&#39;s Library must be unlocked before you can reach the rune puzzle by following the &#34;Remove the Parasite&#34; quest within the Emerald Grove. At this point in the game, every party member is looking for a way to remove the Mind Flayer tadpoles from your heads. Saving the grove from goblins gives you a lead on how to do this when you speak to any survivors of the fight in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

The side quest &#34;Finding a Cure&#34; lists Healer Nettie as one of many possible paths to curing your rare condition. Other routes may include relying on the help of the eccentric NPC Volo in your camp during a long rest or tracking down a Githyanki Crèche, recommended by Lae&#39;Zel in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, if you recruit her as a companion. Those looking to uncover the puzzle should not pursue these other leads.




  

Travel to The Hollow, or the deeper section of the Emerald Grove, where most of the Tieflings have taken shelter. You will want to track down the halfling vendor Arron in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, who has a lot of information about the events happening in the Grove. You can ask Arron where Nettie is as he expresses his concerns and learn that the Healer has a chamber in the Inner Sanctum area.



Going to the Inner Sanctum may put you in direct conflict with some of the druids in the Grove if you antagonize them. Characters with a high Charisma stat or spells like Charm Person can help avoid conflict as you try to reach Nettie.




Talk to Nettie deep within the Sanctum and tell her about the parasite lodged in your head. This will cause her to open a secret path to the Enclave Library and show you the rune puzzle for the first time. Unlocking Nettie&#39;s Library causes it to stay open even after you finish your conversation with the Healer if you want to investigate the structures found in this location.






 Enclave Library Puzzle Solution 
          

The rune puzzle in the Library revolves around finding the missing Wolf Rune on one of four pedestals surrounding a large stone statue of a cat. Three platforms around the structure already have animal-themed totems placed on them. If you investigate further, the one to your far right describes how the &#34;Rune of the Wolf&#34; is needed to complete the collection.

Go back into the main room of the Inner Sanctum and look for the NPC Rath among the people in this area. Rath has the Wolf Rune, but he won&#39;t just hand it over to someone they don&#39;t know. You have a couple of options here that could get you the item right away or one strategy that may take longer to achieve throughout Act 1 in BG3.

The easiest way to get the Rune is to pickpocket Rath with either your character or someone in your party who has a better chance of being undetected. High Dexterity stats lead to better Sleight of Hand and Stealth modifiers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to prevent other NPCs from spotting you. A large Direwolf walking near Rath is especially dangerous and will attack your group if you get caught stealing.




You could also kill everyone in the Grove, then take the Rune from Rath&#39;s dead body once the combat ends. This is a very drastic solution and will prevent you from pursuing several other quests in the sanctuary. Those who rescue Halsin will earn Rath&#39;s trust toward the end of Act 1, which sees the druid simply handing you the artifact as a reward for helping bring back such an important leader.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: How to Recruit Halsin and Minthara Together   Halsin and Minthara are meant to be mutually exclusive. But, doing Baldur’s Gate 3’s quests out of order results in them both joining the same team.   



 Rewards for Solving The Rune Puzzle 
          

Return to the Empty Socket and combine the Wolf Rune with the vacant slot to activate the pedestal near the statue. Go to the other three podiums and interact with each to evoke their magic in BG3. According to YouTube creator Reverie Gaming, you can turn on the Rune of the Wolf last to sink the statue and reveal a set of hidden stairs leading down.





 

Doing this transports your party to the Hidden Vault of the Emerald Grove, which has both the Robes of Summer and Sorrow two-handed weapons as your rewards. Sorrow is a rare &#43;1 magic weapon that deals slashing damage to enemies and has a hidden ability called Sorrowful Lash. This trait lets you pull any creature 3m closer toward you, but not if the target is Huge or larger.

The Robes of Summer only provide a basic 10 Armor Class, but they give whoever wears them resistance to cold damage. This extra protection could help characters who aren&#39;t proficient with any armor. Solving the rune puzzle in Nettie&#39;s Library gives you better gear to tackle the other quests or dungeons your party will encounter in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
