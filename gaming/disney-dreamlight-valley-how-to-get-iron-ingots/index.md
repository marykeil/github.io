To get Iron Ingots in Disney Dreamlight Valley, players must mine ore from specific mineral nodes and dig up dirt mounds found around the Valley.

 The first thing you should consider collecting is Coal, as it is quite common and can be found in every world in Disney Dreamlight Valley. You can dig up coal nodes on the ground using the Royal Shovel whenever you come across them. These nodes can be of different sizes, but they all share the same &#34;cracked-earth&#34; appearance, regardless of the biome. 

To get Iron Ore in in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you need to mine black mineral nodes in specific locations along a cliff&#39;s wall. Iron Ore is found abundantly along the cliff walls that border the Valley&#39;s biomes. Apart from Iron Ore, you can also get Stone and Gems from these nodes, which can be used for other crafting recipes as well. 






The YouTube Iczel Gaming states that Iron Ore can only be mined from nodes in the following regions: Forest of Valor, Glade of Trust, Sunlit Plateau, Frosted Heights, and Forgotten Lands. In other words, any biome but the first three biomes will contain Iron Ore.
