## Literature Review

Thanks to a new cross-promotion, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 players can receive and redeem codes for in-game rewards from cans of Monster Energy.





You won’t find these codes on an in-game can of Perk-a-Cola; instead, you will need to head out into the real world and buy cans of Monster Energy to grab these rewards. According to Activision, there are a couple of ways to get your codes: by pulling tabs on the cans or uploading your purchase receipts if you live in certain regions. You can then redeem the codes for your rewards.

 How To Redeem Modern Warfare 3’s Monster Energy Promo Codes 
          

To redeem your codes, head to the Call of Duty x Monster Energy promo site, where you can register or log on to your Monster Energy account. Once logged in, you can enter your ring pull code straight into the box. You can then find your reward code under the My Codes tab.



Receipt uploads are also available on the same site for players in the USA, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Uruguay.




Once you have copied down your code, you should head to the Call of Duty website to redeem the code to receive your rewards. Any cans with a black Monster Energy tab are part of the promotion, including the following:




          

  Monster Energy x Call of Duty Original Green 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy x Call of Duty Ultra White 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy x Call of Duty Juiced Mango Loco 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy Absolutely Zero 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy Zero Sugar 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy Ultra Rosa 500ml (black ring pull)   Monster Energy Pipeline Punch 500ml (black ring pull)  

Most of the rewards available through this promo are 2XP Tokens, which temporarily double XP gain. They’re among the best ways to earn XP fast in Modern Warfare 3. However, there are a few other rewards available.

There are six packs of rewards available through the Monster Energy promo, and you will unlock each pack in sequence:

  Reward Number   Reward    1   Inner Beast Weapon Blueprint and 15 Min Double XP Token    2   The Beast Operator Skin and 15 Min Double XP Token    3   Caught In The Crosshairs Weapon Vinyl and 15 Min Double XP Token    4   Zero Chill Operator Skin and 15 Min Double XP Token    5   Future Season Content and 15 Min Double XP Token    6   Future Season Content and 15 Min Double XP Token   



You can redeem more than six codes, but each subsequent code only grants you a 15 Min Double XP Token. It’s worth noting that fifteen minutes isn’t much time in-game. As such, you will want to maximize your progress by picking the best weapons and assembling a flexible loadout when going to war against your opponents in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
