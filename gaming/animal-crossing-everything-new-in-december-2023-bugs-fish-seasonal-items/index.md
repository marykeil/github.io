## Literature Review

December in Animal Crossing: New Horizons means the festive season is in full swing. Players can join big events like Toy Day, and catch new critters.





November in Animal Crossing: New Horizons marks the start of the holiday season, with big events such as Turkey Day. However, December is arguably the best month of the year for party animals, thanks to the big Toy Day and New Year’s Eve events. The new month also gives critter collectors lots to do, with a fresh rotation of bugs, fish, and deep-sea creatures to be caught and donated to the Museum.

 December Events And Seasonal Items 
          




Players in both hemispheres can celebrate the Festive Season from December 15th through to January 6th. This isn’t an official event; instead, you can receive Red, Blue and Gold Ornaments by shaking decorated cedar trees.

You can use these Ornaments as ingredients in special Festive Ornament DIY crafting recipes. The crafting recipes are generally used to make festive decorations; perfect for giving your island more of a festive look.

Southern Hemisphere players also get one of Flick’s Bug-Off events on December 17th. This event features a timed bug-catching contest where you can win points and exchange them for special bug-themed prizes. However, if you’re busy with holiday prep, the next Bug-Off takes place in January, so you won’t have long to wait.

Crafting ornaments is a nice way to prepare for Toy Day, which arrives on December 24th in both hemispheres. The reindeer Jingle will make his annual appearance and ask you to craft sets of festive wrapping paper. If you give him the wrapping paper, he’ll follow up by giving you a magic bag, so you can deliver gifts to your villager friends.






Once you&#39;ve delivered gifts, Jingle will give you your own present: a Toy Day sleigh decoration and the DIY crafting recipe for the Gift Pile. Also make sure to hang up Jingle’s Toy Day Stockings, as you&#39;ll receive a special gift the next day if you do.




Finally, New Year’s Eve arrives on December 31st. The Resident Services building will be closed for the day to make room in the town square for the countdown. You can buy light sticks and party poppers from Isabelle and Tom Nook. Around midnight, your villagers will gather in the town square for the New Year countdown. It’s one of the best events in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and a lovely way to wrap up your 2023.
