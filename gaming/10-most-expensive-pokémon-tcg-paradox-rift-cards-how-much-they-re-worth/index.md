## Literature Review

There are several valuable cards you will want to look out for in the Paradox Rift expansion for Pokémon TCG. Here are the most expensive ones.




There are several expensive cards in the Paradox Rift expansion for Pokémon TCG. The new Trading Card Game set has finally arrived, offering players more options to choose from in the current Scarlet and Violet base game. Paradox Rift is a TCG expansion that focuses primarily on the several Paradox Pokémon from Scarlet and Violet, both ancient and future. Creatures like Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant are at the forefront of the new cards, and this specific duo also composes the themes for the various Paradox Rift products, such as Elite Trainer Boxes (ETB) and booster packs.
There are, of course, other monsters featured in the Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift expansion – in fact, some of these other creatures that are not necessarily Paradox or even from Paldea itself are stamped across some of the most expensive cards in the set. Pokémon TCG cards move a lot of money and, depending on their gameplay value, rarity, and general artwork, some items can be worth hundreds of dollars. So far, the Paradox Rift cards are not worth as much, but there are some very expensive pieces that will certainly attract players and collectors.

 10  Parasol Lady 
255/182 (Special Illustration Rare)
        

The tenth most expensive card in the Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift set is called Parasol Lady. According to TCG Player, the card’s market price almost reached $40, with its highest value being $39.96. This is the Special Illustration Rare version of the Trainer card and is numbered 255 in the set with 182 cards. Its price is currently set at $31.05.
Due to its rarity, it may be hard to obtain this specific card. In addition to that, it also boasts a beautiful piece of artwork that thrives on its attention to lighting, shadows, and reflection for something that resembles the art style of the popular anime movie Your Name. Parasol Lady also has great gameplay value, allowing players to shuffle their hand into their decks and draw four cards.





 9  Garchomp ex 
245/182 (Special Illustration Rare)


 







Following Parasol Lady, the next most expensive card is the Special Illustration Rare version of Garchomp ex. This card in the Paradox Rift expansion of Pokémon TCG is numbered 245/182. According to TCG Player, its highest registered market price was $49.99, but is now evaluated at $33.43.
This fan-favorite Gen 4 Pokémon is featured front and center in the artwork. Additionally, it is Terastallized with a Water Tera type, which can drastically change any gameplay tactics on the table. Garchomp ex in Paradox Rift hits very hard with a single Fighting-type Energy, making it a valuable and gorgeous addition to any deck.





 8  Professor Sada’s Vitality 
256/182 (Special Illustration Rare)
        

Trainer cards are some of the most valuable types in Paradox Rift, and Professor Sada’s Vitality Special Illustration Rare version is further proof of that. The card, labeled number 256/182, has reached a price of $39.99, as was registered by TCG Player. Its current price in the Pokémon TCG market has collapsed a bit, and it is more valuable than Garchomp ex at the time of writing, priced at $34.91.
The card has great gameplay value for decks with Ancient Pokémon in it, as it allows two Ancient creatures to have Basic Energy from the discard pile attached to each of them – and players get to draw three cards if they do so. It also features the fan-favorite Professor Sada in an exclusive and delicate artwork.





 7  Tulip 
259/182 (Special Illustration Rare)
        

The Special Illustration Rare version of Tulip is another example of Trainer cards prospering in the Paradox Rift collection for Pokémon TCG. The card, registered by TCG Player, had an all-time market value high of $39.98, but its price has also fallen. Nevertheless, the card is currently a few cents more expensive than Professor Sada’s Vitality, standing currently at $35.05.
The Psychic-type specialist is the Leader of the Alfornada Gym in Scarlet and Violet. Her card allows players to retrieve up to four Psychic-type cards from the discard pile and add them to their hand – this can be a mix of Basic Energy or Psychic Pokémon. Additionally, the card is extravagantly well illustrated.





 6  Rika 
258/182 (Special Illustration Rare)
        

Yet another valuable Trainer card, the Special Illustration Rare version of Rika, numbered 258/182, is one of the most expensive cards in the Paradox Rift set. This Pokémon TCG card was once evaluated at $62.66 but has since seen a price drop, which currently rests at $42.25, according to TCG Player.
The card combines rarity with excellent gameplay value and a fantastic illustration. Rika allows players to look at the top four cards of their deck and add two of them to their hand while shuffling the remaining two and putting them at the bottom of the deck.





 5  Iron Hands ex 
248/182 (Special Illustration Rare)

This Basic Pokémon card requires a lot of Energy attached to it, but pays off with a lot of damage – Amp You Very Much even allows players to claim an extra Prize card if that attack Knocks Out an opponent. Its exquisite artwork, showing Iron Hands breaking through a series of walls, is also a major selling point.





 4  Iron Valiant ex 
249/182 (Special Illustration Rare)


 







Another Future Pokémon, Iron Valiant ex’s Super Illustration Rare has one of the best artworks in the entire Paradox Rift set and, given its rarity and gameplay value, makes it quite expensive. According to TCG Player, this card saw a huge spike in price and then a subtle drop. At the time of writing, this card is evaluated at $57.07.
Iron Valiant ex is a hard that hits very hard, for up to 200 HP, and automatically damages an opponent’s Pokémon simply by moving from the Bench to the Active Spot. Aside from being extremely strong, Iron Valiant ex also comes with a fantastic artwork, featuring the creature along with Iron Bundle, Iron Moth, and Iron Thorns, with a sunset in the distance.





 3  Gholdengo ex 
252/182 (Special Illustration Rare)
        

The Special Illustration Rare version of Gholdengo ex is one of the most expensive cards in Paradox Rift, with its price currently set at $75.26, as seen on TCG Player. Initially, the card numbered 252/182 was worth $98.00. This is a very special card, as it can turn the tides of a battle.
If this Pokémon TCG card is on the table, players get to draw a card during their turn via Gholdengo ex’s Ability and, if it is in the Active Spot, they can draw another card. Gholdengo ex is also capable of hitting pretty hard, as it lands 50 HP for every Basic Energy card that is discarded – there is no limit. It also helps that the artwork is beautiful and features the Pokémon front and center.





 2  Mela 
254/182 (Special Illustration Rare)
        

The most expensive Trainer card in Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift is Mela’s Special Illustration Rare. This card, according to TCG Player, is currently worth $76.04. This is following a dip, as its market price was originally $109.99. There are a lot of reasons as to why it is so expensive. The first is its rarity, followed immediately by the fact that Mela is one of the most popular characters in Scarlet and Violet.
This card also boasts a gorgeous piece of art with Mela and her Torkoal, which deviates from traditional Pokémon TCG illustrations. Additionally, if a player uses it after their Pokémon was Knocked Out, they can retrieve and attach a Basic Fire Energy card from the discard pile to a Pokémon and, after doing so, they can draw cards until they have six in their hand.





 1  Roaring Moon ex 
251/182 (Special Illustration Rare)


 







The most valuable and expensive card in Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift is Roaring Moon’s Special Illustration Rare version, numbered 251/182.

Additionally, Roaring Moon ex allows players to hit for a total of 220 HP if players discard a Stadium in play – it is also capable of automatically Knocking Out the opponent’s Active Pokémon at the cost of 200 of its own HP. Conveniently, this is the strongest and most expensive card in the Paradox Rift expansion for Pokémon TCG.
