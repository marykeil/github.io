## Literature Review

In the new God of War Ragnorak: Valhalla DLC, players will want to get as many upgrades as possible to buff Kratos up as much as possible.





There are a lot of rewards in the GoW Ragnarok: Valhalla DLC and longtime fans will likely be happy to see many of them. However, like many roguelites, it can take a lot of work to get from beginning to end on this one. Players can make each run easier by spending Mastery Seals, Spirit Seals, and Divine Influence at the Tablets on the Shore between runs.
Temporary upgrades, such as glyphs, can be unlocked throughout a run, but because these are variable and will likely change based on what’s offered, this list will focus on the best permanent upgrades that Kratos can unlock. 

            
 
 God Of War Ragnarök: Valhalla - Who Helios Is &amp; Why Kratos Decapitated Him 
The ancient Greek Sun god plays a major role in God of War Ragnarok’s Valhalla DLC, and his history with Kratos goes back to even before God of War 3.












 








 6  Better Starting Stats 
Tablet of Reflection - Basic Stats
        

Many of the better permanent upgrades can only be unlocked as you progress through the DLC, but right away, there will be cheap upgrades available to boost your stats for things like Health. Getting your Health, Rage, Defense, and Strength a boost from the start will allow Kratos to take down enemies a little easier and make progress happen faster. This is enough to hit the ground running and should help you reach the point where better upgrades are possible.





 5  Live Longer With More Health 
Tablet of Reflection - Resurrection Stone


One of these upgrades is getting a Resurrection Stone to give you a second chance after being defeated, and it can also be upgraded later to provide you with a second Resurrection Stone. This is common in many roguelites that players could also unlock in God of War Ragnarok in the main story. If you are having trouble getting the resources to pay for it, make sure to look at the Labors you can complete for more materials, as YouTuber JorRaptor explained in the above video.





 4  More Upgrades Faster 
Mastery &amp; Spirit Seals Pot Increase
        

These upgrades will allow Kratos to find more and more Mastery and Spirit Seals within runs by breaking pots. These will also make the pots glow, making them easier to spot, and both of these upgrades will allow you to get stronger faster. Like most roguelites, taking the increased XP option is well worth an early investment, so check both of these out as fast as possible.





 3  Make Each Run Easier 
Tablet of Influence - Echoes: Starting


This upgrade will allow you to get 100 - 300 Fleeting Echoes at the start of each run. This will allow you to purchase a glyph as soon as possible and perhaps get better glyphs sooner. This can also allow you to complete Labors quicker, as many involve picking different glyphs and unlocking those rewards. In the above video, YouTube creator KhrazeGaming highlights many of these rewards, and they are one of the better new elements from GoW Ragnarok&#39;s Valhalla DLC.
            
 
 God Of War Ragnarök: All 10 Berserker Boss Battles, Ranked By Difficulty 
The Berserkers offer some of the toughest challenges Kratos can face in God of War Ragnarök. Here are all 10 of their battles, ranked by difficulty.








 2  Upgraded Health Regen  
Tablet of Reflection - Critical Health Regen &amp; Health Looter
        

These upgrades do very similar things in that they regenerate Kratos’ health at very specific moments. The Critical Health Regen restores health up to a certain percentage after an encounter, but only if you’ve fallen below a certain amount. This can be a lifesaver, but it will not always trigger. Health Looter, however, will always trigger and heal Kratos by a certain percentage after he loots a Legendary Chest or Rift, which also usually spawns after every encounter. Together with the Resurrection Stone, these should give Kratos a generous amount of survivability.





 1  More Rewards for Harder Enemies 
Valhalla’s Chosen Seal


 







This upgrade will initially double the amount of Mastery and Spirit Seals received after defeating a Valhalla’s Chosen enemy. These enemies are a little more challenging, but getting resources out of them for permanent upgrades is a must. Gaining all of these resources is what will eventually allow you to finish the God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla DLC and complete the roguelite time and time again. While more permanent upgrades are available and tiers for each one, these are the best ones to get first to ensure survival long enough to get the rest.
