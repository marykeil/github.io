## Literature Review

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#39;s inclusion of Zonai devices is phenomenal; however, there are a number of ways it could be improved.




The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a phenomenal game, with a plethora of features that in any other game would be undeniable highlights - such as the buildable vehicles and other contraptions from Zonai Devices. While these devices are plentiful and varied in TOTK, there is still plenty of room for improvement, and a number of excellent additions could be made to maximize the efficiency of, and entertainment that can be experienced with Zonai Devices.
Obtaining Zonai Devices in TOTK is pretty simple; all Link needs to do is visit a Device Dispenser, or find the numerous parts scattered all across the vast land of Hyrule. Powered with Energy Cells, creating and using the often deadly Zonai contraptions can be one of the most entertaining aspects of the game. Despite this, the Zonai Device parts available in TOTK are somewhat limited in application and there are so many possibilities with how this fundamental part of the game could be carried over into TOTK&#39;s eventual sequel - though there are some Zonai Device ideas that absolutely should come to fruition.
            
 
 One Zelda: TOTK Zonai Device Is Almost Useless, Until It Isnâ€™t 
A Zonai Device in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom initially seems useless, but this perception of the item changes dramatically with time.












 








 10  Big Rocket 
A Zonai Device To Launch Link
        

Though there are a number of ways to launch Link into the air, including the already handy Rocket, a method to fire him even higher with a Zonai Device is a potentially valuable and time-saving ability that TOTK lacks. Therefore, a Zonai Device that absolutely must feature in TOTK&#39;s sequel is a sort of Big Rocket that could project the Hero of Hyrule into the stratosphere, or launch attached objects and vehicles at even faster speeds. This Zonai Device combined with Link&#39;s mastery of the paraglider could make for an incredibly entertaining and highly efficient method for the traversal of the enormous world map that any future Legend of Zelda game may have.





 9  Drill 
A Device To Break Rocks &amp; Ore More Efficiently
        

While it could easily become overpowered, and therefore must be employed sparingly, a Zonai Drill would make for an excellent addition in any future TOTK sequel. With myriad uses, including offensively, a drill could allow Link to more easily explore blocked-off areas that are hidden behind large boulders or walls of rocks. Furthermore, a Zonai Device that allows Link to drill could be invaluable while traveling in caves and other underground areas, making it much easier to collect ore from their veins.
            
 
 The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence 
Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.








 8  Vacuum 
For Collecting Items
        

A Zonai Vacuum with the capability of sucking up resources or items could be an enormous time saver in future The Legend of Zelda games. This prospective Zonai Device would allow Link to drive around without having to repeatedly mount and dismount his constructed vehicle to collect important items and resources. Though this may sound lazy, piloting a custom vehicle can become a tedious process of checking and re-checking to ensure that potentially valuable items are not missed - a Zonai Vacuum would solve this and may have other cool abilities, like also being a random item projectile launcher.





 7  Elemental Time Bombs 
Zonai Bombs That Inflict Frost &amp; Shock Damage


 







An iteration on TOTK&#39;s Time Bombs that inflict various kinds of elemental damage would be an incredible addition to the next Legend of Zelda game. Whether they are shock or frost, the ability to deal a specific kind of elemental damage would be very useful in many situations, giving players more options when it comes to combat strategy. Time Bombs in TOTK already explode after a short time and inflict burning on unlucky enemies caught in the blast, but with the variety of items already in the game, it&#39;s a bit strange that shock and frost variants don&#39;t exist.





 6  Zeppelin 
For Link To Float Horizontally


 







Though the Zeppelin is a mode of transportation with a poor reputation and increasing scarcity in the years after the advent of the airplane and helicopter, a Zonai Device that mimics the properties of a Zeppelin could be an excellent addition to TOTK&#39;s eventual successor. While this Zonai Device itself could simply allow Link to float, the addition of Zonai fans could transform this stationary balloon into a fully functioning and pretty cool transportation option.





 5  Remote Steering Stick 
To Control Zonai Devices From A Distance
        

Zonai contraptions are often used in perilous situations; therefore, the ability to remotely pilot a small Zonai Device would allow Link to remain out of harm&#39;s way while still taking on his most dangerous of adversaries. A Zonai Remote Steering Stick could allow Link to control a simple Zonai drone vehicle. There are numerous potential applications for such a device - it could be used in a stealthy way, to access areas that are otherwise out of reach for Link, or perhaps it could simply be used in an offensive manner to take on a hoard of powerful and dangerous enemies.





 4  Crane Arm 
A Device To Improve Construction
        

Though crane arms have developed a reputation as a difficult arcade or carnival game, they have incredible potential in The Legend of Zelda as a Zonai Device to assist in construction or to help Link move otherwise immovable obstacles out of his path. Furthermore, although the arcade crane arm is an unwieldy beast, cranes are, in construction and other uses, incredibly dexterous - a fact that could be fully exploited by Link in TOTK&#39;s eventual sequel.





 3  Antenna 
Transmit &amp; Receive Communications
        

An antenna could be a wonderful addition to the Zonai arsenal in future The Legend of Zelda games. While it is difficult to conceptualize how it would be used, there are a number of options for what a Zonai antenna could achieve and how it could help Link. Most likely, this form of Zonai Device could be used for communication between Link and another party, but it could also be used to help Link locate Zonai Devices, or find otherwise hidden items, locations, and NPCs.





 2  Sticky Wheels 
For Vehicles To Climb Steep Slopes


 







TOTK made climbing, especially in the rain, a lot easier than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; however, a future Zelda game could make it even easier for buildable vehicles by a Zonai Device to help expedite the process of summiting obstacles. A couple types of wheels already exist in TOTK, with the Big Wheel being particularly well-suited for rough terrain. Sticky Wheels, however, could prove to be even more useful, giving extra grip to a vehicle on particularly steep grades.





 1  Zonai Missiles 
A Powerful Barrage In Combat
        

Some of the most entertaining Zonai Devices in TOTK is the powerful offensive weapons like Cannons. Though there are a few excellent options to choose from, the next The Legend of Zelda game could massively expand on Link&#39;s arsenal and add Zonai Missiles. These potentially devastatingly powerful weapons could make quick work of even the most powerful of foes. Furthermore, their explosive capabilities could be used to destroy obstacles. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom most impressive builds already use Zonai weaponry to great effect, but a barrage of missiles would certainly take things to the next level in a sequel.
               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017. A rare occurrence in Zelda titles, Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel instead of loosely connected. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link will take to the skies and learn about a mysterious kingdom in the clouds. Additionally, he will discover the secrets of the dark ones that dwell below and above the earth. The sequel is being built on the same engine as the original, with unique physics tools again being utilized. However, little about the plot and gameplay is known.
