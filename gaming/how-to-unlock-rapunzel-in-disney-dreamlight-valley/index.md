## Literature Review

The Disney Princess Rapunzel can be unlocked in Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s A Rift in Time expansion pack and is a wonderful villager and companion.





To start searching for Rapunzel in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you must first finish a few quests. These quests revolve around the beginning of an exploration into Eternity Isle, which is tied to unlocking EVE in Disney Dreamlight Valley. This gives you the Royal Hourglass, a new tool used to aid players with future quests. Rapunzel will be located in The Grasslands, behind a waterfall called The Wild Tangle.

 How To Open The Ancient Door 
          

After finishing some quests to Rapunzel&#39;s storyline in Disney Dreamlight Valley, she will give you a few tasks. Rapunzel will be standing near a door she cannot open. She needs Sun Cores to unlock the Ancient Door and asks you to break the five gray floating rocks near her, containing three pieces. Shortly after, you must find two other Sun Core pieces, which can be found in random locations around The Plains and The Docks.



The most notable locations of the floating gray rocks are in The Courtyard area in Ancient&#39;s Landing, unlocked after reaching Eternity Isle In Disney Dreamlight Valley, and next to Goofy&#39;s Stall in The Docks.







          

Go to a crafting station to create the complete Sun Core and return to Rapunzel at the door. Once the door opens, the Sun Core will float around the area, catch it, and place it in the Sundial where the Sun Core lands. By interacting with it, Rapunzel will task you with finding specific gear around Eternity Isle because it is not working. These gears can be stationary or flying, requiring you to glide or run fast to catch them around Dreamlight Valley. 

Ten will be needed and can be found in different locations, such as the Glittering Dunes and Ancient&#39;s Landing. A quick video by GosuNoob shows where they found the Sundial Gears. Bring all of them back to Rapunzel, interact with the Sundial, and cross the bridge to the next part of the quest.

Once the Disney Villain cutscene is finished, you will retrieve Rapunzel&#39;s Paints and The Jewel of Time. Rapunzel&#39;s further friendship quests can be accessed, and she has been completely unlocked as a friend and villager in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
