## Literature Review

To catch Shrimp in Disney Dreamlight Valley, Dreamers must be on the lookout for a particular color of fishing nodes along the shores of Dazzle Beach.





Bouillabaisse, in particular, is a required dish that you will need to make during the Dreamlight Valley Friendship Quest &#34;Dinner with a Friend.&#34; Goofy will task you to catch several types of sea creatures, including Shrimp. While it is evident that Shrimp can be caught by fishing, the game does not explicitly tell players where or how to acquire the crustacean.




                  Disney Dreamlight Valley: Entire Recipe List   Disney Dreamlight Valley has over 100 recipes for players to create using a multitude of different ingredients that they can forage for or grow.    


 Where To Get Shrimp in Dreamlight Valley 
          

You will not be able to catch Shrimp from regular fishing spots and instead need to look for blue-ringed nodes by the sandy shores of Dazzle Beach. If you need a visual representation, you will notice a bluish circle and bubbles floating about the water&#39;s surface. Looking for a quick video on where to catch Shrimp in Dreamlight Valley? Check out the video walkthrough from Game Guides Channel on YouTube below to see just where Shrimp can be found.


 




Fishing at these spots can yield Shrimp and Kingfish, so you must be patient to get the right catch. According to the Game Guides Channel video featured above, it is possible that occasionally fishing spots will not appear at all at Dazzle Beach. If this happens, simply go to another area for a while and check back later.



If there are no blue Dreamlight Valley Shrimp spawn points at Dazzle Beach, be sure to fish at the other nodes to clear them out before leaving and returning! This makes more room for the blue-ringed ones to spawn.






 Dinner With A Friend: Dreamlight Valley Request 
          

By repeating the steps listed above, it should not take long until enough of Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Shrimp is obtained. Players only need to cook two Bouillabaisses to complete &#34;Dinner with a Friend,&#34; and only one Shrimp is needed for each. The full recipe is:




 Bouillabaisse Recipe   Any Seafood  x2   Any Vegetable  x1   Tomato  x1   Shrimp  x1   



If players use the &#34;Auto-Fill&#34; function when cooking in Disney Dreamlight Valley, more than one Shrimp stack may be consumed, forcing players to return to Dazzle Beach and repeat the fishing endeavor. To prevent such a predicament be sure to place the random Seafood first, such as two Clams, before inserting Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Shrimp, so all the hard work does not go to waste.
