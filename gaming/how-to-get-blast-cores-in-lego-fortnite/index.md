## Literature Review

LEGO Fornite characters can boost their fire power with the rare Blast Core item used for crafting but keep in mind their explosive properties.





The reason why you need to find Blast Cores in LEGO Fortnite is for the Metal Smelter. This not only upgrades your items but lets you craft useful survival materials as well. Epic-tier level equipment is also necessary later on in the game, so these Cores are extremely important to find. They are obtained by defeating an enemy called Blasters, which can be very difficult without losing precious resources or dying.





 Where to find Blasters for Blast Cores 
          

Finding Blasters for Blast Cores is easy as there is only one specific biome in LEGO Fortnite where they can be found. For example, you will only need to scout the Desert Valley biome for a Lava Cave, which conveniently has been mapped out by Z1 Gaming for easy access.


 

They highlight an area north of the desert where they specifically find a Lava Cave, but they state that these caves can be found more around the middle of the desert part of the map or just by exploring.

Another important item adjacent to finding Blast Cores are Cactus plants in LEGO Fortnite which assist mid-to-late game play. Furthermore, since the desert and Lava Caves themselves are in very hot climates, make sure to have cooling foods or a cooling charm to keep your character from overheating and possibly dying. Z1 Gaming also recommends you take a glider to get around the desert faster.






 How to Defeat Blasters 
          

Take precaution when fighting Blasters in LEGO Fortnite for Blast Cores as they are extremely flammable and will explode when triggered. They are very similar to an enemy called a Roller and do massive amounts of damage on contact. Once in the Lava Caves, keep an eye out for a wiggling rock with a glowing light and large spikes coming out of it.

It will then try to light itself up and follow the character to blow itself up. It is recommended to either let the Blaster kill itself and dodge out of the way or to use projectiles to defeat the enemy before it begins to fight. Finally, the Blast Core upon the enemy&#39;s death will be there as a loot drop guaranteed.
