# One Often Overlooked BG3 Item Can Power Up A Fan-Favorite Character 


## SUMMARY 



  Soul Coins in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can provide Karlach an extra 1d4 fire damage in combat.   Using a Soul Coin consumes a bonus action, but the effects last until the next long rest, making them a valuable resource.   While using Soul Coins may raise moral concerns, there are no apparent repercussions in the game, and they&#39;re not necessarily valuable enough to be must-sell items.

## Literature Review

It&#39;s easy to miss or forget about some interesting advantages in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and even minor buffs can make a big difference in the long run.




There&#39;s no shortage of ways to get the edge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 combat, but one of the easiest to use is also one of the easiest to forget about. With long lists of spells and items to wrangle, it doesn&#39;t take much for tools kept in the recess of an inventory to slip the mind. In more difficult encounters, however, wasting anything that could be used without repercussions can hand the victory to the enemy for no reason at all.




One such feature is the inclusion of Soul Coins in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which can be found early on and crop up in various locations throughout the game. Soul Coins are used to power up Karlach&#39;s infernal engine in combat, giving an additional stat boost to the Barbarian in the form of an extra 1d4 fire damage. This only applies when she&#39;s raging or below 25% of her health, but as long as she hasn&#39;t been respecced out of being a Barbarian in a campaign, meeting the rage requirement is easy to frequently manage.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Soul Coins Shouldn&#39;t Go Unused In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          




1d4 fire damage might not seem like a lot in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but that kind of damage can quickly add up in combat. While some other Origin characters are best put to use in roles that focus on support functions as well as aggressive actions, Karlach is all about attacks, and throwing her into the fray lets her get in blow after blow on crowds of enemies. Adding a bit of extra damage that can stack with other effects like elixirs makes long fights more manageable overall, even if its effects seem minor in the moment.

Spending a bonus action to use a Soul Coin could still be a concern, considering how powerful Karlach&#39;s bonus actions can be, but Soul Coins can be consumed before an encounter to ensure that no moment in combat is wasted. The effects last until the next long rest, so even a fight that ends up being easier than expected doesn&#39;t have to mean that an expended Soul Coin won&#39;t be put to much use. That doesn&#39;t mean they should be deployed with abandon – they&#39;re still a fairly rare find in the game – but hoarding them won&#39;t do anyone any good.




                  How To Romance Karlach in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   To romance Karlach in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players must always be compassionate and heroic. Helping her fix her infernal engine heart is also essential.   

It&#39;s always good to keep potential enemy resistances and weaknesses in mind when using Soul Coins. Unfortunately for Karlach, fire damage is commonly resisted in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, so powering up against the wrong enemies might not accomplish exactly what she would hope. Fighting fiends with a Soul Coin typically won&#39;t yield exciting results, and should she ever find other Tieflings on the opposite side of the battlefield, it isn&#39;t going to fare any better against them. Wet enemies also gain resistance to fire, a strength counterbalanced by vulnerability to lightning and cold damage.



 Using Soul Coins Doesn&#39;t Have Repercussions In BG3 
         




The biggest reason why someone might intentionally decide not to use Soul Coins in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the apparent moral complexity of employing them. Each Soul Coin has a soul trapped inside of it, and consuming one will destroy the soul forever, with no chance of an afterlife for whoever had the misfortune of meeting such a fate. Although this might seem like behavior that would be out of line for a party striving to stick to a good alignment, the actual implementation in the game fails to back up this notion in any tangible way.

                  One Bad Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Decision Is Actually The Best Choice   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has lots of tough moral choices for the player to face throughout the game but in one case doing the wrong things is the best option.   

Unlike many morally questionable Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 decisions, consuming Soul Coins doesn&#39;t have any apparent ramifications, and even the general do-gooder Karlach ultimately seems comfortable using them. The game also doesn&#39;t offer any way to actually free the souls inside the Soul Coins, so the choice seems to be one between leaving them trapped or destroying them. Although the finality of the latter option can seem harsh, it doesn&#39;t necessarily seem like the worst thing to do, as being trapped in infernal iron isn&#39;t a happy way to spend eternity.






 Soul Coins Lack Other Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Applications 
          

There isn&#39;t much point in saving Soul Coins for a rainy day, as Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 lacks any alternative way to put them to use. It seems likely that they may have once been intended to play a more diverse role in the final product, serving as currency for a cut Avernus area or providing more of an interesting moral dilemma, but the ultimate implementation doesn&#39;t go beyond the combat application. If any DLC content ever takes the game to Avernus, it could always address this, but it&#39;s likely to provide its own fresh supply of Soul Coins if it ever does happen.



Larian Studios hasn&#39;t announced plans for any Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 DLC yet, but it&#39;s clear that if anything does happen, it will be a full expansion rather than microtransactions.







Soul Coins do fetch a decent market value in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, with each coin being valued at 100 gold. If Karlach never sees action or is left out of a party altogether, that sum is nothing to sneeze at, but it&#39;s also not impressive enough to make selling them exceptionally attractive if they can be put to use. With so many cabinets and chests to rifle through, scrounging together the funds for most purchases isn&#39;t particularly hard, so selling Soul Coins in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is best saved for times when other options are exhausted.

Forgetting to make use of Soul Coins isn&#39;t going to sink the average Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaign, but it&#39;s a shame to reach the end credits and have ten or fifteen power-ups lying around in Karlach&#39;s inventory. Whether trying to clear out low-level encampments quickly or get a bit of extra damage in against a challenging boss, the boost provided by a Soul Coin is worth paying attention to. Karlach is a strong Barbarian even without any assistance, but sending her infernal engine into overdrive with Soul Coins takes things to the next level in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
