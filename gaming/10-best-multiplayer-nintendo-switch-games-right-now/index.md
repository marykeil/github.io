## Literature Review

The Nintendo Switch features many games that are great for playing multiplayer in either wild co-op situations or fierce competitive battles.




The Nintendo Switch can be a wonderful console for playing multiplayer games, particularly with its several Nintendo-exclusive cooperative titles, as well as many games that can be enjoyed with friends on other systems via crossplay. Nothing can quite match the fun of playing a game with friends or family in the same room in local play, which many Nintendo games are designed for. If looking for online multiplayer fun, the choices available for Nintendo players are vast and can help people feel connected even over long distances.
Anyone looking to play online with friends using the Nintendo Switch will need to make sure they have a Nintendo Switch Online account, which is required for any kind of online play, in addition to giving access to some of the service&#39;s catalog of games. For local play, this should not be necessary, even if connecting two Switches, as long as they are on the same Wi-Fi. Whether local or online, here are some of the best games to try out on the Nintendo Switch with friends and family to have a great time.

 10  WarioWare: Move It! (2023) 
Up To Four-Player Local Co-Op
        

  WarioWare: Move It!  


  Franchise    Wario Ware     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    November 3, 2023     Developer(s)    Intelligent Systems , Nintendo     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action , Party Game    


WarioWare: Move It! is only available in local play, mainly because the physical movement required for the game is much more enjoyable when shared in the same room. The game features many microgames where the Joy-Cons are used for motion sensing as players take on certain poses and ridiculous games that can involve fishing for a hotdog octopus or unrolling toilet paper. The main story of the game can be played with one to two players, and then there is a Party Mode that is for two to four players. WarioWare: Move It! earned 4 stars in Screen Rant&#39;s review, and has a Metacritic score of 75.





 9  Overcooked! All You Can Eat (2020) 
Up To Four-Player Online Or Local Co-Op


 







 Overcooked! All You Can Eat (Nintendo Switch) 


  Franchise    Overcooked     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    November 10, 2020     Developer    Team 17     Publisher(s)    Team17     Genre(s)    Multiplayer    


For chaotic, fast-paced action that is supposedly cooperative, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is a true test of communication and working together in a hilarious multiplayer environment. The game is all about quickly making food, filling orders, and occasionally putting out fires. It can be played locally as well as online, with cross-platform play supported on all systems. Overcooked! All You Can Eat is a compilation of Overcooked! and Overcooked! 2, with remastered visuals and a handful of new content, and has earned a Metacritic aggregate score of 84.





 8  Mario Party Superstars (2021) 
Up To Four-Player Online Or Local Competitive
        

  Mario Party Superstars  


  Franchise    Mario Party     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    October 29, 2021     Developer(s)    NDcube     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action , Party Game    


Mario Party games are a great way to enjoy a board game-like experience in a video game setting, with the extra ability to enjoy silly and fun minigames. As the minigames are the star of the show, it is fitting that this game takes the best of the experiences from the past two decades of Mario Party games and puts them all in Mario Party Superstars, offering 100 minigames in this iteration. The game can be enjoyed by up to four players locally, or in an online mode with either random players or friends. Mario Party Superstars was given 4.5 stars in Screen Rant&#39;s review and has a Metacritic score of 80.





 7  Splatoon 3 (2022) 
Up To Eight-Player Online Competitive &amp; Co-Op
        

  Splatoon 3  


  Franchise    Splatoon     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    September 9, 2022     Developer(s)    Nintendo EPD     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action , Third-Person Shooter , Adventure    


Nintendo&#39;s exclusive properties traditionally try to present themselves as more family-friendly, without an emphasis on a lot of blood and gore that can appear in many of the popular games in the industry. Splatoon 3 is, therefore, Nintendo&#39;s flagship shooter series, giving players a non-traditional third-person shooter environment using ink that is more graffiti than dangerous. As players spray their color of ink across the map in its base Turf War mode, they try to occupy the majority of the map and take out opponents at the same time. The Screen Rant review of Splatoon 3 gave this colorful shooter 4.5/5 stars, and it has a Metacritic score of 83.





 6  Kirby And The Forgotten Land (2022) 
Up To Two-Player Local Co-Op
        

  Kirby and the Forgotten Land  


  Franchise    Kirby     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch     Released    March 25, 2022     Developer(s)    HAL Laboratory     Publisher(s)    Nintendo     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure    


The hungry little pink Kirby uses all kinds of new powers in his adventure game Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and perhaps surprisingly, he can bring a friend along for the ride. Though it is designed as a single-player game at its core, a second player can join on the same screen as Bandana Waddle Dee using a second controller. Bandana Waddle Dee cannot float like Kirby, and some of the attacks are different, but they do have a special spear that is a powerful weapon. Kirby and the Forgotten Land received 4.5 stars from Screen Rant and has a Metacritic score of 85.





 5  Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3 (2019) 
Multiple Local &amp; Online Multiplayer Modes

Super Mario 3D World was previously on the Wii U, and made a jump to the Nintendo Switch while being packaged with a short new game called Bowser&#39;s Fury. Both of the games offer cooperative multiplayer, although where Super Mario 3D World allows up to four players to join forces from among several playable characters, Bowser&#39;s Fury only lets up to two players enjoy it, with one playing as Mario while the other controls Bowser Jr. Screen Rant&#39;s review of the game scored it a rating of 4.5/5 stars, with a Metacritic score of 89.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder was released in October 2023 and quickly joined The Game Awards&#39; nominees list for Game of the Year. Although it did not win that coveted title, it did take home the award for Best Family Game. Mario&#39;s platforming adventure in the Flower Kingdom lets up to four players play together in local multiplayer, or up to 12 people can connect in a private room, although only four at a time can play the levels together.
