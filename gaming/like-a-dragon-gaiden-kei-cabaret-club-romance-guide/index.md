 How To Romance Kei in Like a Dragon Gaiden 
          

Aside from selecting the most affectionate response when speaking with Kei, you can also occasionally buy her a drink or give her a gift to increase your affection in Like a Dragon Gaiden. The more costly the drink or gift, the more affection you will receive. There is an item called mini-more Perfume that you can purchase from the Ebisu Pawn shop that increases the amount of affection you get from your answers.




Aside from that, once you&#39;ve filled out the affection gauge, you will be given a rank-up question to earn Kei&#39;s heart. There is only one correct answer to each question, so choose wisely. In total, there are three rank-up questions you&#39;ll need to answer right to unlock Kei&#39;s special cutscene.
