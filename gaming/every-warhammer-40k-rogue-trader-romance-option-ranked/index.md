## Literature Review

Having the option to enjoy a little romance in an RPG like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader can make the game a bit more interesting and entertaining.




Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader does not focus heavily on its romance options among the Lord Captain&#39;s companions, yet there are possibilities for a few of the relationships to blossom into something deeper. This isometric CRPG supplies a cast of interesting characters that players can get to know, each having uniquely personal motivations and backstories that can make some more difficult to get close to than others. This dark world is not conducive to a lot of lighthearted cheer, yet, as in the real world, love can form anywhere if the spark is there, or at least if the player makes the correct dialogue choices with an available NPC.
Although many games in recent years have become more inclusive in allowing marriage options to not be reliant on certain genders, in Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader, the already-limited romantic opportunities are limited even more by two of the NPCs having certain preferences in that regard. Cassia Orsellio can only be persuaded to enter a relationship with a male character, and Heinrix Van Calox will likewise be limited to only female characters. Thankfully, the other three choices of NPC partners are happy to consider either gender.
            
 
 Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review: &#34;Gets What Warhammer 40,000 Is All About&#34; 
Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader translates the world of the tabletop game into an isometric RPG excellently, even with the odd clunky moment.












 








 5  Marazhai Aezyrraesh 
Can Be Romanced By Male Or Female Characters


 







Marazhai Aezyrraesh is a Drukhari Warrior who is open to a relationship with anyone, yet may not be the most moral of partners. He has a very chaotic, evil approach to life and, as a worshiper of Slaanesh, he has no regard for rules. Marazhai responds well to romantic advances and is, unfortunately, the only option for a male character who would like to romance another male, yet there are certainly problems with this choice of lover.
Generally, the Drukhari are known to be the cruelest xenos that exist in the Imperium. Marazhai Aezyrraesh, also known as &#34;the Dracon of the Kabal of the Reaving Tempest,&#34; has an insatiable thirst for power over everyone and tricks many into deals that lead to his gleeful torture of them. He is only joining forces with the Rogue Trader out of a last-ditch effort to save himself, and he is not one to be trusted, nor is he likely to truly give his heart to any.





 4  Yrliet Lanaevyss 
Can Be Romanced By Male Or Female Characters
        

As an Aeldari, Yrliet Lanaevyss is very mistrusting of humans, and it does not take much for an attempted relationship with her to go very poorly. Humans do not generally interact with Aeldari, or any other xenos, unless they hold prominent positions like Rogue Traders. Yrliet chose to walk the Path of the Outcast and explore faraway places, but that doesn&#39;t mean she is open to trusting everyone she meets. For the player&#39;s character to have any hope of getting close to her, they need to essentially walk on eggshells and do everything possible to not annoy her.


For a romance option, Yrliet is a very different type of relationship. She does not appreciate any attempts at flirtation or kissing, she does not want to be interrupted when she is doing something like meditating, and she has a fairly large role in a part of the story. With a lot of patience, she will eventually be open to holding hands, but it is hardly a fireworks type of situation. She is at least open to relationships with either male or female characters.





 3  Heinrix Van Calox 
Can Only Be Romanced By Female Characters
        

For those with female main characters, Heinrix is another romance option in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, but he will not accept advances from a male. Heinrix van Calox is an interrogator who has undergone rigorous training to use roughness, fearmongering, and psychic powers to become indispensable in his service. This history makes him quite cold and hardened, giving the appearance of one who doesn&#39;t want friendship, much less anything more than that.
Despite the indifference and formalities that Heinrix shows, the best way to form a relationship with him is to always choose dialogue options that have a physical aspect, such as anything that includes kissing, handholding, or invitations to stay. While he is trained in all manners of mental trickery, he is apparently quite weak against the power of any physical intimacies.

Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is becoming an increasingly attractive prospect for fans of western RPGs, even those unfamiliar with the franchise.








 2  Jae Heydari 
Can Be Romanced By Male Or Female Characters


 







Jae is the easiest NPC to romance in Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. In addition to being open to either gender&#39;s advances, she is a very friendly and charismatic character, which is somewhat rare in this dark existence. She is easy to flirt with and doesn&#39;t require much to get her interested. Jae has the respect of many but also has earned the hatred of some whom she has surpassed in success during her lifetime. She is adept at making deals and has a mind for business, and she is smart enough to know that having a powerful Rogue Trader by her side is in her best interest.
Ultimately, the most important thing the player character can do to earn the heart of this Cold Trader is to give her a present, but not just any present. The gift that will win Jae Heydari over is a planet in the Dargonus&#39; star system. This possibility will offer itself after a strong relationship has been formed and the main quest on Dargonus has been completed.





 1  Cassia Orsellio 
Can Only Be Romanced By Male Characters


 







Cassia Orsellio is a navigator as well as the heiress of a Navis Nobilite House. As a human mutant, she is very self-conscious and requires a lot of reassurance, support, and patience in order to form a bond. Assurances that she is beautiful and other positive messages will go a long way with Cassia, as well as listening to her suggestions and showing interest.
An important event happens during Act 2 with the option to send birds to Cassia&#39;s room to check on her. In order for a relationship to progress, players must not ignore this crucial step. 

Unfortunately, Cassia will only be receptive to romantic advances from a male Lord Captain in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. As is the case with many of the companions in the game, Cassia has personal quests which will also be beneficial to forming a closer relationship with her.
