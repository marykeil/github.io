## Literature Review

Neopets just gave its long-lost players an incredible reason to come back to the game in 2024. Hereâ€™s what it is, and when it becomes available.




Looking for an excuse to check on that long-abandoned Neopets account? The perfect reason might&#39;ve finally come along. First launched in 1999, Neopets was once the biggest digital pet game in existence. Players could buy, win, trade, collect, and customize a wide variety of colorful cartoon animals. Mini-games, events, forums, and an ever-shifting economy kept gameplay interesting for years. It&#39;s since become a major point of nostalgia for many a millennial, with former players fondly remembering their long-lost pets and the site&#39;s charming, quintessentially Y2K aesthetic.




But anyone who&#39;s tried to log into their old account in the last few years might&#39;ve realized that the Neopets they remember is long gone. The company&#39;s changed hands a few times, and each new owner instituted its own set of sweeping changes. The death of Flash rocked the Neopets boat, but the site held the course. The announcement of Neopets NFTs in 2021 stirred up controversy, and the project was eventually canceled. Despite it all, Neopets is still up and running as of 2024. However, one upcoming change could roll back the clock in a major way.

                  Neopets Reportedly Heading To Nintendo Switch   Neopets could be coming to the Nintendo Switch console, now that the loss of Adobe Flash Player has brought that era of websites to an end.    


 Neopets Is Bringing Back Its Classic Art Style 
          




As announced on the official Neopets website, the original Neopets art style is making a comeback in 2024 in a brand-new set of NC Pet Styles. Sitewide changes in 2007 saw most original pet artwork replaced with new portraits. The new style is fine, but for nostalgia&#39;s sake, Neopets just isn&#39;t Neopets without the original art. Pets that still have their original artwork, commonly called Unconverted or UC Pets, are highly sought after, now a staple on the Neopets black market. That&#39;s all bound to change, however, when classic Neopets art is available to all beginning on January 23, 2024.

For the time being, it&#39;s unknown which pets NC Pet Styles will extend to, nor how players will be able to get them. It&#39;s also unknown whether the new Pet Styles will be available permanently, or whether they&#39;re part of a limited-time event. However, more details are set to be revealed in a Neopets livestream. Those interested can learn more about the updates by tuning into one of Neopets&#39; official social media channels on January 17, 2024, at 5 PM PST.




Even decades later, there&#39;s no shortage of early 2000s nostalgia, and Flash games like Neopets are a big part of that. Call it a sea change or call it a part of growing up, but the 2007 change in art style was a deal breaker for many players. According to Neopets, this has been a highly requested feature for quite some time. A comeback of the classic Neopets art style could bring an influx of returning players to the game - and this time, they won&#39;t even have to try and remember their passwords from 20 years ago.
