## Literature Review

Dikke acts as both a F2P healer and sub-DPS in Reverse 1999. If you want to use her, build her like a DPS and have her teammates cover utilities.





Dikke is a 5-Star Beast character who deals Mental DMG. Since her healing is based on her ATK, she needs to build similar to any other DPS unit. That means pairing her with a Psychube that provides a good ATK bonus and improves the effectiveness of her attacks. She fits into most teams as the best F2P healer option.





 The Best Psychubes For Dikke 
         

Because Dikke needs to build her raw ATK over other traits, there aren&#39;t as many Psychubes that work well for her. Most of the Heal-tagged Psychubes have a low ATK bonus, but on the other hand, most of the ATK Psychubes have Amplifications that don&#39;t apply well to Dikke&#39;s kit. At least she has a few options that provide strong ATK bonuses and at least partially useful Amplifications.

If you want a Psychube that boosts Dikke&#39;s healing, provides up to a 410 ATK bonus, and boosts all DMG by up to 12%, His Bounden Duty is the best Psychube available for Dikke. This Psychube is labeled as both an ATK and a Heal Psychube. It is also a popular choice for main DPS characters like A Knight in Reverse 1999. If Dikke manages to defeat a target with His Bounden Duty equipped, she&#39;ll heal by up to 120% of her ATK.






Part of why His Bounden Duty&#39;s Amplification works so well for Dikke is because when she&#39;s on your team, you can&#39;t spam her healing if you want her to be truly effective. You&#39;ll need to wait to heal the team until they are below 50% HP to get that bonus. If Dikke has this Psychube and needs healing, you can let her deal the final blow against an enemy for an easy heal.




Sadly, His Bounden Duty is not an option for all players. Brave New World could work well for Dikke as a replacement if you don&#39;t want to give this great ATK Psychube to one of your main DPS characters. When fully leveled up, Brave New World has a 370 ATK bonus and an 18% Ultimate Might bonus that plays well with Dikke&#39;s strong Ultimate. Once she uses her Ultimate, her next Incantation gets up to 40% Incantation Might.

                  Honkai: Star Rail - Topaz Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Topaz is a Fire DPS character that follows the Path of the Hunt in Honkai: Star Rail. Here are her best builds, Relics, team comps, stats, and more.   

The last Psychube that fits into Dikke&#39;s kit well is The Footloose, a 5-Star Psychube with a 310 ATK bonus. It provides up to 15% more Ultimate Might, but its usefulness comes in its HP-connected Amplification. If Dikke attacks an enemy with more than 50% HP, she can deal up to 16% more DMG in her attack. Since she is a sub-DPS whose attacks will be important in the earlier phases of combat, The Footloose fits her kit extremely well.






 The Best Team Comps For Dikke 
         

Dikke fills her team comps in Reverse 1999 as the resident survival character, focused on keeping her other teammates safe. However, her sub-DPS skills also lend herself to fulfill some support roles. Therefore, her team comps can include support characters who focus on other utilities rather than DPS. She&#39;ll still need a strong DPS to stand behind, though.

When you&#39;re looking for a main DPS, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with Centurion, the strongest DPS in Reverse 1999. Her attacks are powerful and well-balanced, destroying enemies with massive Reality DMG. She has a Beast Afflatus like Dikke, so you&#39;ll need to be aware of sending these two into combat against enemy teams with lots of Mineral Afflatus characters. However, send them both against a team with Plant Afflatus and they can decimate the competition.




Centurion can be hard to pull, so you&#39;ll need a good substitute DPS. Druvis III is an excellent choice for team comps centered around stunning enemies and taking them out when they can&#39;t act. Druvis III has a special status she can inflict on enemies called Petrify, which makes them unable to act until either 1 or 2 rounds pass, or until the enemy takes Reality DMG. Since both Dikke and Druvis III deal Mental DMG, it&#39;s easy to keep Petrify going. You just have to build Druvis III&#39;s Incantation, Wind Into The Woods, enough to unlock Petrify.

Now it&#39;s time to look for a few solid support options. Voyager can pair with both Centurion and Druvis III as a wonderful controller and debuffer. Since she deals Mental DMG, she won&#39;t dispel Druvis III&#39;s Petrify statuses, and she&#39;s one of the best support characters to pair with Centurion. She even supports Dikke&#39;s sub-DPS aspirations by boosting her DMG with an Interstellar Blessing status. She makes enemies more vulnerable to critical attacks while dealing a few strong attacks herself.




                  Reverse 1999: The Best X Build (Psychubes &amp; Team Comp)   X is a solid dispeller and crowd controller character in Reverse 1999. His best builds play on his debuffs and encourage teams that weaken enemies.   

Baby Blue can join a team comp with Dikke and Druvis III to stun enemies when Druvis III cannot. This 5-Star character may deal low Mental DMG, but she can weaken her enemies with a strong debuff that builds up to her Ultimate, Tea With Friends. If the debuffs from her Incantation are still active, she applies Nightmare to all enemies, rendering them unable to attack until either the end of the round or until someone attacks them. This gives Dikke time to heal the group and lets Druvis III pick her next target carefully.

While these team comps are fairly specific, Dikke can fit into most other team comps as a solid replacement for top-tier healer Medicine Pocket. Dikke works well in any teams that need to deal more DMG but lack a good way to recover. For a F2P character, she&#39;s a strong unit in Reverse 1999.
