# Every Cyberdeck in Cyberpunk 2077, Ranked


## SUMMARY 


 Cyberdecks are required to perform quickhacks in 
Cyberpunk 2077
. 
 A cyberdeck&#39;s efficacy is largely dependent on personal playstyle and an individual V&#39;s build, but some are still objectively better than others. 
 The best cyberdecks have good base stats, but also benefit multiple builds, having universally beneficial effects.

## Literature Review

Cyberdecks give V many Netrunner abilities in Cyberpunk 2077, including quickhacks and Breach Protocols, but there are many decks to choose from.




Update 2.0 for Cyberpunk 2077 fundamentally changed a lot of the hacking mechanics, making the cyberdecks in the game have even more distinct effects. Though this makes it harder to rank them, as what is best is often determined by individual playstyles, each model of cyberdeck offers unique strengths. V has a wide variety of choices, but some of the decks still stand out as being superior to others regardless.
Cyberdecks in Cyberpunk 2077 are what V uses to perform hacks in the game. Three main stats are typically listed – RAM, Slots, and Buffer – with bigger numbers always being preferred for all three. RAM refers to how many hacks V can do before having to recharge, Slots are how many quickhacks can be loaded, and Buffer Size is an indicator of how many inputs V is allowed in the Breach Protocol mini-game.
Many Cyberdecks have different quality levels under the same name, purchased from different locations. For this list, only the best of each type is listed.

 8  Militech Paraline MK.4 
Good For Combat-Heavy, Run-And-Gun Builds
        

The Militech Paraline is the cyberdeck that V starts with in Cyberpunk 2077 and can be upgraded to Tier 5&#43;&#43; with some patience and eddies. It is not anything extremely flashy, yet when upgraded to max stats it can be a powerful deck. It is not good for stealth, but for run-and-gun players, this cyberdeck is a good one because of the extra damage buffs.
  RAM   9    Slots   8    Buffer   12    
In addition to the above stats, the Militech Paraline MK.4 can add &#43;10% damage to quickhacks and &#43;2% Monowire damage per used RAM unit up to &#43;30%. If V uploads a quickhack to an enemy, shooting them with a smart weapon will accelerate the upload speed. Finally, if Overclock is active, any smart weapons and Monowire will give additional electrical damage equal to 60% of the normal attack damage.





 7  BioDyne MK.2 
Good For Early Game
        

The BioDyne MK.2 is only a Rare quality level, but it is a good deck to have early in the game. It only costs 10,000 eddies, and it has more benefits than any of the comparably-priced cyberdecks that V would be able to get early on.
  RAM   9    Slots   4    Buffer   6    
In Cyberpunk 2077, the BioDyne MK.2 will give V the ability to perform quickhacks on targets and devices while scanning them and increases RAM recovery rate by three units/60 seconds.





 6  Stephenson Tech MK.4 
Good For Faster Quickhacks
        

The Stephenson Tech MK.4 has a handy legendary effect of reducing quickhack upload time by up to 25%. This is in addition to allowing V to perform quickhacks on targets and devices while scanning them.
  RAM   10    Slots   8    Buffer   6    
With this deck, quickhack cooldown is reduced by 45% and any combat quickhacks will last 50% longer. Essentially, with all of these boosts, V can quickly perform hacks before anyone knows they are there.

 5  Biotech Sigma MK.4 
Good For Combat &amp; Damage-Over-Time Effects
        

Although it&#39;s only listed as Epic rather than Legendary, the Biotech Σ MK.4 is useful enough to be listed above a couple of the Legendaries as far as rank. With the changes in Update 2.0 to Cyberpunk 2077, this deck is powerful for combat, particularly in adding 10% damage-over-time to quickhacks and a 60% duration increase to combat quickhacks.
  RAM   9    Slots   8    Buffer   12    
Biotech Sigma MK.4 will also add &#43;25% Monowire damage against enemies that have been affected by any damage-over-time effect, and whenever Overclock is activated, it will reset the duration of quickhack damage-over-time effects, which when timed right can effectively double the durations.





 4  Arasaka MK.5 
Good For Stealth


 







The Arasaka MK.5 at Tier 5&#43;&#43; is a good cyberdeck in Cyberpunk 2077 for those creating a stealth build. Its extra benefits all work towards making V harder to detect, even offering a 100% increase in how long it takes enemies to trace V&#39;s location.
  RAM   9    Slots   8    Buffer   12    
In addition to those stats, the Arasaka MK.5 adds a -2 RAM cost for any covert quickhacks and &#43;5 RAM added after successfully performing a takedown. Essentially, the Arasaka M.5 cyberdeck makes stealth easier, and using that to take down enemies in turn rewards the player with the ability to perform more quickhacks.

 3  Raven Microcyber MK.4 
Good For Defense &amp; Damage Spread


 







Not only does the Raven Microcyber MK.4 have good basic stats, but it also only requires 14 street cred to get it, making it a great cyberdeck to get early in the game and then upgrade. It is most useful for players who like to have a lot of spread damage as it causes quickhack spread distance to be increased by up to 60%.
  RAM   10    Slots   8    Buffer   12    
The Raven Microcyber MK.4 allows V to do quickhacks on devices and targets while scanning them and has a boost to increase the cyberdeck RAM recovery rate by six units/minute. Perhaps the most notable benefit of the Raven Microcyber MK.4, however, is that it gives V 100% increased resistance to enemy netrunner hacks.





 2  Netwatch Netdriver MK.1 
Good For Stealth &amp; Combat
        

Before Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Update 2.0, The Netwatch Netdriver MK.1 was named Netwatch Netdriver MK.5. Despite it now being an MK.1, its base rarity is still a Legendary Tier 5, and upgrading it won&#39;t increase the number. The Netdriver is a great cyberdeck for those who prefer their V to be focused on stealth and working from a distance through a camera or laptop, and works well for vehicle hacks.
  RAM   13    Slots   8    Buffer   12    
The Netwatch Netdriver MK.1 also provides a bonus of -20% traceability for quickhacks uploaded through cameras and a -50% RAM cost for device and vehicle quickhacks. Combat quickhacks that are uploaded via devices have an increased 30% damage and 50% effect duration.





 1  Tetratronic Rippler MK.5 
Good For Every Build


 







Fully upgraded to Tier 5&#43;&#43;, the Tetratronic Rippler MK.5 is easily the most effective cyberdeck in the game. It offers a lot of everything for V, including non-combat and combat boosts.
  RAM   20    Slots   8    Buffer   12    
In addition to the above stats, it also allows V to perform quickhacks on enemies and devices while scanning and provides an additional &#43;15% weapon damage for enemies affected by non-combat quickhacks. Plus, it provides &#43;12 max RAM and automatically uploads Reboot Optics and Weapon Glitch to all enemies within an 8m range when Overclock is activated. The Tetratronic Rippler MK.5 is available for purchase from Ripperdocs in Cyberpunk 2077, but only once V has reached level 40.
