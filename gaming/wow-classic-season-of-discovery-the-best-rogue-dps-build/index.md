## Literature Review

Seasons of Discovery allows much customization in World of Warcraft Classic. But, Rogues still excel at DPS despite it all.





Season of Discovery captures the magic and chaos of World of Warcraft’s initial release. You will not find any cross-faction gameplay in WoW: Classic, and there will be an overall hostile wilderness. You should be careful and prepared before heading to the enemy’s territory.




                  Every WoW Classic &amp; Hardcore Season Of Discovery Profession, Ranked   World of Warcraft Classic has introduced the Season of Discovery and Hardcore servers, where death is permanent. But professions can save you.

Having such a small level limit means very few points to build around. However, that also means each choice can be extremely important. While there are powerful builds, be sure to adjust stats and Talents to fit your playstyle. You can also supplement your time and gold by undertaking a crafting profession in World of Warcraft.

Talents
You will only have 16 points to distribute at the maximum level. A great DPS Rogue will focus solely on the Combat tree. This allows consistent damage, even if it doesn’t have many situational bonuses.

Runes
With a bit of stored reputation, you can purchase powerful Runes in WoW: Classic. Depending on your faction, these are gained from the Azeroth Commerce Authority or Durotar Supply and Logistics. The merchants only offer a small supply, and other Runes will need to be discovered out in the field.



Runes are further segmented into Glove, Chest, and Leg slots. You can only equip one of each, for a total of three. Despite this, you should still collect them all so that you may change them for specific situations.
