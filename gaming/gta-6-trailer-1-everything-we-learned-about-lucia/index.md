## Literature Review

GTA 6&#39;s first trailer offered a look at the game&#39;s Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo, Jason and Lucia as they embark on a crime spree through Leonida.




After many years of leaks and speculation, Rockstar Games has finally revealed its first look at the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6. The trailer offered a look at the game&#39;s new Florida-inspired location, Leonida, and while Rockstar has yet to confirm who is portraying them, it revealed the game&#39;s main protagonists, Lucia and Jason.




While GTA Online allows players to fully customize their characters, Lucia will be both the first female protagonist in a Grand Theft Auto campaign in the 3D era and the first of Latin-American descent, putting her at home in the state of Leonida. This information had been previously leaked, but the new trailer has provided a glimpse at Lucia&#39;s backstory and key relationships, particularly with her partner in crime, Jason.



The first Grand Theft Auto game had the option to play as four women, Ulrika, Katie, Divine, and Mikki. However, outside of the avatars on the menu screen, the only difference between them and the four male characters was their pixelated pants and hair, and this had no impact on the missions or gameplay. 




                  GTA 6 Trailer Released Early After Leak, Rockstar Confirms Release Year For Next Massive Game   After years of waiting, Rockstar has finally revealed the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, showing off the game&#39;s location and characters.   


 Lucia Already Has A Criminal Past 
The GTA 6 Trailer Opens With Lucia In Prison
          




Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer opens with Lucia already incarcerated in one of Leonida&#39;s prisons. When asked why she is there by a member of staff - likely a member of a parole board - she nonchalantly shrugs it off saying &#34;Bad luck, I guess&#34;, suggesting that she has a relaxed attitude to crime that&#39;s somewhat befitting of a Grand Theft Auto protagonist. This sequence does indicate that GTA 6&#39;s campaign won&#39;t follow her first foray into crime and means that she can jump back into her criminal exploits with her connections and expertise already established.

If so, it&#39;s possible that GTA 6 could have a similar opening sequence to its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto 5, showing a heist that went wrong years before the game&#39;s main story. While that game had Michael De Santa cutting a deal with the Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) and moving to Los Santos, things could go very differently for Lucia, leading to her arrest. Lucia also sports an ankle monitor in GTA 6&#39;s first promotional art, which suggests that her parole could have a major impact on her story and movements, potentially being the in-game reason she can&#39;t leave Leonida.




The TikTok-esque social media videos placed throughout the trailer could simply be a way to introduce the world of Leonida and the eccentric &#34;Florida Man&#34; type of characters who inhabit it, or it could be a way for Grand Theft Auto 6 to satirize the popularity of true crime media. If it&#39;s the latter, this would be a novel way of covering Lucia and Jason&#39;s crime spree in the media, offering an insight into the public&#39;s opinions on the matter.

If so, it&#39;s possible that Lucia could already be famous through her previous criminal exploits, or her crime spree in Grand Theft Auto 6 could result in some kind of fame and notoriety in the media. Either way, this would be an interesting direction for the franchise to take, with the crimes of the real world Bonnie and Clyde - who Lucia and Jason seem to be based upon - covered heavily in the press, making the duo some of the most famous robbers of their time.

                  GTA 6 Needs To Steal Red Dead Redemption 2’s Most Important Story Feature   Grand Theft Auto 6 could learn a lot from Red Dead Redemption 2, but one feature in particular could offer the most far-reaching benefits.   






 Lucia And Jason Are A Modern Bonnie And Clyde 
The Duo Go On A Crime Spree In GTA 6&#39;s Trailer
         

The trailer also revealed Lucia&#39;s main relationship with a man named Jason in GTA 6. It had previously been rumored that Jason would be the second playable protagonist in the game and that he and Lucia would be a modernized Bonnie and Clyde, going on a crime spree through the streets of Leonida.

This was confirmed in several sequences in the trailer, with Lucia and Jason committing several robberies and being involved in a high-speed car chase, moments that are expected in a Grand Theft Auto title. Lucia can be heard in a voice-over telling Jason that the only way the two of them will get through the situation they&#39;re in is by &#34;sticking together and being a team&#34;, suggesting that she is the driving force in these criminal ventures, and that and whatever moral framework she employs revolves heavily around trust.




                  GTA 6 Map Leaks: Everything Confirmed &amp; Debunked (So Far)   There have been a ton of rumors about GTA 6 map leaks and where the next game will take place, but players shouldn’t believe everything they hear.   



 Something&#39;s Pushed The Duo Back Into A Life Of Crime 
Lucia And Jason&#39;s Crimes Seem To Be Driven By A &#34;Situation&#34;
          

The trailer doesn&#39;t suggest what the &#34;situation&#34; is that pushes them back into a life of crime, however. It&#39;s possible that the failed job that got Lucia arrested before GTA 6&#39;s story could have angered a member of an established criminal organization from one of the other Vice City-based titles, such as the Cubans, Haitians, Vercetti Crime Family or even the Vice City Bikers, as bikers could be seen as part of GTA 6&#39;s trailer footage. Therefore, Lucia and Jason could be trying to get enough money to clear their debts and escape Leonida.




Alternatively, the two could simply be trying to get enough money to leave town and retire somewhere. Previous rumors suggested that Lucia and Jason may have a young child already, which would be a first for the Grand Theft Auto series. This would certainly give them plenty of incentive to leave their past lives behind and raise their child away from their criminal activities after carrying out one last major job.

Unfortunately, if Rockstar does choose to mirror the story of Bonnie and Clyde with Lucia and Jason in GTA 6, this venture could be doomed, as Bonnie and Clyde were real-life criminals who were shot to death by FBI officers in an ambush in 1934. While two of Grand Theft Auto 5&#39;s endings resulted in the death of one of its protagonists - either Michael or Trevor - its canonical ending, Deathwish saw all three protagonists survive. Therefore, it would be a first for the long-running franchise if Rockstar were to have both of its playable characters meet such a brutal end in Grand Theft Auto 6.
