## Literature Review

​​​​​​​Many Pokémon video games have been released over the past couple of decades, leading to a debate on which are the best entries in the series.




Deciding which Pokémon video game is the best can be a heated debate, as the games can become truly personal to some players who have really enjoyed their time with certain characters and in specific areas. For some, the first game that introduced them to the franchise may hold a special place in their hearts, whereas for others it may come down to what provided the best storyline or combat experience. Ultimately, the concept of the best Pokémon game will come down to personal preference and choice, although it is still fun to rate them.
For this list, games have been chosen based on overall scores from ranking websites such as Metacritic and Ranker, as well as Pokémon community forums and much debate from within the Screen Rant editorial and writing teams. In a franchise that has well over a hundred games, it is not plausible to make a perfect list, so if a person&#39;s favorite game does not appear here, it does not need to detract from the value of that title. If, however, someone wants to see some great Pokémon video games to check out or to expand their horizons, this list is a good place to begin.
            
 
 10 Pokémon That Deserve Their Own Spin-Off Game After Legends: Arceus 
There are several Pokémon that could be put under the spotlight for a Legends: Arceus-like game, even if it is a spin-off. Here are some of the best.












 








 10  Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield 
Released November 15, 2019


 







Pokémon Sword and Shield introduced Generation 8 Pokémon to the world, along with the new gigantic-sized Pokémon via Dynamax mechanics. The games take place in the Galar region, inspired by the real world&#39;s United Kingdom, and leads the player through the region to battle eight powerful Gym Leaders and the current Champion, in the hopes of becoming the new Champion. There was a lot of controversy surrounding the game, yet the traditional Gym Challenge formula being brought back with this game and its new additions truly makes the game special, as well as the Wild Area that gives an open-world feel.





 9  Pokémon X &amp; Y 
Released October 12, 2013
        

Pokémon X and Y were the first Pokémon games to be released on the Nintendo 3DS and presented some of the best online functions of any game in the series to that point. For the time, its graphics were state-of-the-art with its 3D look, and to top it all off, it was the first time that Mega Evolutions were introduced to the series. The games have received a high Metacritic score of 88, and are still being played by many today.





 8  Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl 
Released September 28, 2006
        

Pokémon games these days have a strong focus on the ability to trade with other players, and Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were the first games to be able to take advantage of Wi-Fi capabilities to allow for that to easily happen over long distances, as well as having a very fun multiplayer area called The Underground. Diamond and Pearl also took advantage of the Nintendo DS touchscreen to great use. Set in the Sinnoh Region, the games are also beautifully designed to feel cozy and pleasing.





 7  Pokémon Legends: Arceus 
Released January 20, 2022


 







Pokémon Legends: Arceus shows off a new type of Pokémon gameplay, with only one city surrounded by lots of open areas consisting of five separate biomes full of their own native Pokémon to find. As it is set back in time, NPCs in the game are not familiar with Pokémon training and players get a chance to create the first Pokédex and teach humans about them. So much of the world feels organic and new, providing a wonderful change of pace for Pokémon Trainers.

 6  Pokémon Black &amp; White 
Released March 6, 2011
        

Not only did Pokémon Black and White introduce many new Pokémon to the Pokédex, but they also had arguably one of the best narratives for any of the Pokémon video games to date. The mysterious character known only as N and Team Plasma&#39;s villainous schemes were entrancing. Both games have received impressive Metacritic scores of 87.





 5  Pokémon Stadium 
Released March 6, 2000
        

One of the spin-off games for the Pokémon series, Pokémon Stadium was made for the Nintendo 64 and featured many mini-games, battles, a hall of fame, and more. The game was one of the best-selling N64 games and has since been ported to the Nintendo Switch. Unfortunately, one of its most popular features, a Transfer Pak that would let players bring their Pokémon from other games into Pokémon Stadium, is not available for the Switch.

 4  Pokémon Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire 
Released November 21, 2014
        

Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are remakes of Game Boy Advance games from 2002, redesigned for the Nintendo 3DS. The games added even more story depth to the narrative set in the Hoenn region and brought in many of the Pokémon and features that had been introduced in games since 2002, including Mega Evolutions. Players can have Secret Bases that they can decorate, and visit other Secret Bases of trainers all over the world thanks to online functionality.





 3  New Pokémon Snap 
Released April 30, 2021


 







Another spin-off Pokémon game, New Pokémon Snap is a photography game. Rather than capturing and battling with Pokémon, players get to ride in a fun, self-propelled vehicle and take snapshots of the creatures existing happily in their native environments. It is a sequel to Pokémon Snap that was released on the N64 in 1999 and captures a lot of the same nostalgia while being a new, standalone title.

 2  Pokémon Red &amp; Blue 
Released September 28, 1998
        

Pokémon Red and Blue were the games that started it all. They were the very first Pokémon video games and were available for the Nintendo Game Boy. Due to being the originals, they hold a special significance in the franchise and were the starting point of many basic foundations and concepts that every Pokémon video game has carried forward.

 1  Pokémon HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver 
Released March 14, 2010
        

Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver have incredible User Scores of 9.2 on Metacritic, alongside an 87 Metascore, and for good reason. They have a great story that is filled with humor and enjoyable characters, and they do a good job of introducing new players to the Pokémon game experience without being too overwhelming or talking down to people who are familiar with the series. The mix they have of battle mechanics, catching Pokémon from the large Pokédex in the game, and the story is well-balanced and has a lot for everyone to enjoy.
