## Literature Review

To get Black Cores for crafting high-end workstations in Valheim, players must venture into the Mistlands in search of the biome&#39;s dangerous Dungeons.





Once in the Mistlands players should be in search of Dungeons called Infested Mines, added in Valheim’s Mistlands Biome &amp; Update. These mines feature some of the toughest enemies in the current game patch. Seekers, Seeker Soldiers, Seeker Broods, and Ticks lurk in the Dungeon&#39;s slimy, mossy halls, lying in wait to pounce on unsuspecting adventurers. The Seeker Soldiers, in particular, possess over a thousand points in HP and can deal 100 points of damage in its basic form. Taking these monstrosities down will require equipment with high defense or choice positioning with ranged weaponry like the Staff of Embers.

 Black Cores Locations 

 




According to YouTuber Jade PG, Infested Mines in Valheim are recognizable by their long stairwell entrances with a greenish, yellow ooze seeping from the entryway. Once inside, the halls might seem somewhat tranquil, but once players venture deeper into the Valheim Dungeon, they will be ambushed and assaulted by the hive of Seekers, the giant insectoids that patrol the mine&#39;s chambers.



Because of the sheer number of insectoids that can attack simultaneously, we highly encourage you to have a shield or a means of crowd control, such as the Staggering Effect of the Himmin Afl Polearm&#39;s Lightning.




Black Cores in the Infested Mines will typically spawn atop tall poles and shine with a purple glow in Valheim. These poles will spawn in the main corridors, but they can also appear in hidden chambers indicated by a stone door with bluish runes. Every mine in the Mistlands should have at least two Black Cores, with six being the average maximum number.
