# One Highly-Overlooked Baldur s Gate 3 Action Will Add Flavor To Any Campaign


## SUMMARY 



  Performing music in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is an underrated action that adds character to the game.   There are six playable songs and six instruments in the game, and different combinations can be experimented with.

## Literature Review

One action in Baldur’s Gate 3 can make a huge difference, but it may be difficult to come by. Here’s the most underrated action, and where to find it.




There&#39;s a lot players can do in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but one key action is sorely overlooked. It&#39;s not exactly a sandbox game, but the freedom of movement and action provided really does make it feel that way sometimes. Most actions can be undertaken at any time, with any character as their target, allowing players to experiment and discover new ways forward. And even in the most unlikely circumstances, it&#39;s near-impossible to break Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.




But there&#39;s one underrated action that can add a lot of character to a campaign. It&#39;s totally free, has little to no impact on the action economy, and, besides being pretty cool, can actually have a couple of practical uses. Here&#39;s everything to know about this easily-missed BG3 feature.

                  For One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Race, Romance Is Very, Very Different   Baldur’s Gate 3 doesn’t include every race in the Forgotten Realms, but one that made it into the game has wildly different views of romance.   


 Don&#39;t Ignore The Perform Action In BG3 
         

Perform is a simple action in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 with multiple uses, and can add a lot to any runthrough. It can be undertaken by any character, at any time - with varying degrees of success depending on their equipped items and Proficiency in Musical Instruments. Since it&#39;s a free action, it can be used at any time, in or out of battle, and doesn&#39;t require a target. When it&#39;s used in battle, it doesn&#39;t consume an action or bonus action, so a bard can simply start performing at the end of every turn if they so desire.




Of course, they can also play a song whenever they like. It&#39;s sometimes nice just to listen to the different tunes available, and to experiment with different combinations of instruments. There are technically six types of instruments that the party can play: flutes, lutes, lyres, violins, and hand drums. However, if a character is Proficient in Musical Instruments, and they attempt to Perform without an instrument equipped, they&#39;ll simply whistle their chosen tune.



There are six playable songs in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: “Bard Dance,” “Sing for Me,” “The Queen’s High Seas,” “Old Time Battles,” “The Power,” and “Of Divinity and Sin.” “Of Divinity and Sin” is a new arrangement of the main title theme from Divinity: Original Sin, Larian’s previous CRPG series.




There are also a few unique instruments scattered throughout the world, but their effects are mostly (with one exception) cosmetic. Also, if each member of the party has a different instrument equipped, and selects the same song, they&#39;ll automatically play together in harmony. Now, anyone can Perform in BG3 - as long as they have an instrument equipped, the action will begin appearing in their hotbar or radial menus. However, if the character playing doesn&#39;t have the required Proficiency, the resulting tune will be off-key, off-tempo, and generally off-putting.






 How To Get A Musical Instrument (And Proficiency) In BG3 
          

The easiest way to gain the Perform action in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is to take a level in bard; at level one, all bards get Musical Instrument Proficiency and the starting instrument of their choice. However, multiclassing as a BG3 bard isn&#39;t for everyone, and there is an alternate route. It&#39;s fairly easy to find musical instruments as random loot, so parties midway through the game may want to check their inventories to see if they might already have one. If they&#39;d rather a fancier one, there are several available at The Chromatic Scale music shop in the Lower City, and a couple available as quest rewards.



Players who purchased or pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 also have access to a free exclusive instrument: the Lute of the Merryweather Bard. Find it in the Traveler&#39;s Chest at camp.







Alfira and Nere have a lute and a lyre, respectively, that they&#39;re willing to give up under certain conditions. If the party kills True Soul Nere in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, or convinces him to help them get through the Shadow-Cursed Lands, they can borrow his lyre. It can be used not only as a regular instrument, but also to help them summon a tour guide, who can lead them through the area while protecting them from the curse. Minthara has a lyre, too, but she&#39;s less willing to part with it. However, if the party defeats her as part of the Emerald Grove quest, it may be looted from her.

                  A Hidden Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Weapon Includes A Clever Mechanic More Games Should Use   Baldur’s Gate 3 revives an age-old weapon mechanic that more games should borrow from. Here’s how, and why most players will never even notice it.   

The only way to learn to play an instrument in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is to succeed in certain dialogue options during the party&#39;s first encounter with Alfira, the tiefling bard rehearsing near the Emerald Grove. Approach her, let her explain the situation, and eventually, a dialogue option that reads, &#34;Hand me that lute. We can perform together,&#34; will appear. Tav can play along with Alfira as she gets over her writer&#39;s block, and they&#39;ll have to pass two Performance checks during the ensuing conversation. But as long as they do, they&#39;ll walk away with Proficiency - and Alfira will throw in her teacher Lihala&#39;s lute for good measure.






 The Practical Purpose Of Music In BG3 
          

But even among the most experienced bards, it&#39;s a little-known secret that music can be used to make stealth easier in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Perform is a distraction. Use it anywhere, and throngs of people will crowd around the party&#39;s resident musician, absolutely spellbound by their talent. This works in any number of situations, from busking in Baldur&#39;s Gate to occupying the guards while the rest of the party stages a jailbreak. This strategy is effective anywhere that the party wants to do something that would ordinarily make NPCs hostile, but doesn&#39;t work on those that enter combat as soon as they see the party.

Just have the bard stand away from whatever they don&#39;t want the enemy to see, and start banging out a tune. As long as they pass a Performance check, all the NPCs in the area should stand perfectly in place, watching the show as if they&#39;ve had hold person cast on them. The rest of the party can go wild in the background, picking locks, looting containers, and picking up stray items. However, it&#39;s crucial to ungroup the bard from the rest of the party before they begin their performance. Otherwise, they might lead the distracted NPC right into whatever misdeed their companions are doing.




Music is much more than mere entertainment in BG3 - applied properly, it can be used to get the party out of some sticky situations. But even aside from that, it can be a lot of fun. Scoring the party’s own battles, playing a peaceful tune while wandering the wilderness, or holding a massive concert in Baldur’s Gate can make even the most mundane aspects of gameplay immensely entertaining. Performance is one Baldur’s Gate 3 feature that shouldn’t be missed.
