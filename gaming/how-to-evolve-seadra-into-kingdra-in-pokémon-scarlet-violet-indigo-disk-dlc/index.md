## Literature Review

Evolving Seadra into Kingdra will require players to hunt down a specific item in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet and find a partner to trade with.





Quite like some other Pokémon, Seadra must be traded while holding a specific item to evolve into Kingdra. The item in question, a Dragon Scale, can be obtained easily through one of two ways. The first method involves progressing the Indigo Disk DLC Pokédex, while the other will require completing BBQs in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk to earn BP.

Though purchasing the Dragon Scale may sound like the easiest of the two options, both will require some work, so it&#39;s really up to player preference. However, the Dragon Scale obtained through the Indigo Disk Pokédex is essentially free, so this method is recommended. To obtain the Dragon Scale, you will need to register 170 Pokémon to your Indigo Disk Pokédex and claim the reward. This may sound like a lot but note that you&#39;re not starting from zero.

The other option if the Pokédex sounds like too much work is to purchase the Dragon Scale from the Blueberry Academy School Store. Unfortunately, the BB Academy School Store only accepts BP currency in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk. While 250 BP may not seem like much, BP is used for several things in the Indigo Disk DLC, including unlocking the different Pokémon gen starters, redecorating the Club Room, and even inviting Paldea competitors to BB Academy, which unlocks a secret mystery fight.






Not only is BP used for such a variety of things, but it requires a lot of BP to do most of these, so wasting even a small amount is not worth it. Especially since earning BP can generally be very tedious and time-consuming.




The only way purchasing the Dragon Scale would be recommended is if there is no intention of doing anything else requiring BP payments. In this case, feel free to spend it in the BB School Store and take advantage of the other items for sale there.

Once the Dragon Scale is in inventory, a Seadra must be caught in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. They are native to the Polar region of the Terrarium but can be a little rare to spot, so feel free to catch one of the more plentiful Horsea and evolve it through leveling if this appears to be easier. Now that a Seadra has been caught, move it to the party and give it an item to hold. The item it needs to be holding is the Dragon Scale.




From here, the only thing left is finding a partner to trade with. For those more unfamiliar with trading, do not make random online trades, as there will be a new partner every time, and the odds of getting your Kingdra back will be slim to none. Instead, contact a friend, as this is the best way to ensure you get your Pokémon returned safely. Unfortunately, Seadra will evolve while traded, so you will miss out on the evolution itself. However, it&#39;s a small price to pay for receiving back a fully evolved Kingdra in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.
