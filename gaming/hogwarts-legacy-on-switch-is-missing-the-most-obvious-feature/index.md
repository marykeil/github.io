# Hogwarts Legacy On Switch Is Missing The Most Obvious Feature


## SUMMARY 



  Hogwarts Legacy finally arrives on the Nintendo Switch, introducing a wider audience to a pre-Harry Potter adventure set over 100 years ago.   The Switch version lacks motion controls for spell casting, missing out on the immersive experience it could have offered.   While the portability of the Switch is a plus, the game has technical limitations, including downgraded graphics and longer loading times compared to other consoles.

## Literature Review

Hogwarts Legacy is finally available on the Nintendo Switch, but this port doesn’t use a feature that could’ve made it feel truly magical.




Hogwarts Legacy is finally arriving for the Nintendo Switch after a long delay compared to its release dates on other platforms, which were released in February 2023, nearly a year earlier. But the journey to Hogwarts of the past is now accessible on the Switch, letting a wider audience experience an adventure long before Harry Potter was even born. However, the inclusion of a certain feature could&#39;ve set the Switch version apart from other consoles if its technology had been used to the fullest.




Before Harry Potter arrived at Hogwarts and continued his parents&#39; fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, there was an evil that threatened the wizarding world through the use of Ancient Magic and the negative emotions it could remove from people. The game provides a look at Hogwarts as it was over one hundred years ago, following the journey of a student who&#39;s able to see and use traces of Ancient Magic. But Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch doesn&#39;t include one specific control option that would&#39;ve made it a truly magical game.

 Hogwarts Legacy On Nintendo Switch Lacks Motion Controls 
         




The capabilities of the Nintendo Switch are perfect for including motion controls for Hogwarts Legacy, specifically for casting spells. However, this technology ended up not being used, likely due to the limitations that were already making it a difficult game to port to the system. Considering how immersive it could&#39;ve felt to wave the controls like a wand in order to use spells, it&#39;s a shame that it wasn&#39;t implemented in the Switch port.



 The Switch&#39;s Technological Limitations With Hogwarts Legacy 
          

The download size of Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch showed the limitation of the system&#39;s default storage space, but that&#39;s not the only area that suffered due to technology. Compared to other consoles, the graphics of Hogwarts Legacy on the Switch have been downgraded for the game to run properly. In the Nintendo Switch version, there are loading screens that divide the open-world elements seen on other consoles, and the game&#39;s loading times overall are longer on the Switch.




On the bright side, being able to play Hogwarts Legacy anywhere, thanks to the portability of the Nintendo Switch, is a feature that can make up for its drawbacks, especially with the holidays coming up and the potential for traveling that comes with them. However, the game would&#39;ve been taken to the next level despite the drawbacks if it capitalized on the Switch&#39;s motion control capabilities to implement motion spell casting. Being released with the limitations of the Switch is impressive for this game, but given the delays and downgrades, a new Nintendo console would be better for a game like Hogwarts Legacy.
