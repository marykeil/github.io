The upcoming 7-Star Blaziken Tera Raid In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet can be beaten solo if players use a sound strategy and the perfect team.





Before accessing this 7-Star Tera Raid in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, complete the base game. This means you must finish the story past Area Zero and complete the Academy Ace Tournament. After completing around 10 5-Star Tera Raids, Jacq will call you about exploring 6-Star Tera Raids, which also unlocks 7-Star Tera Raids. By connecting to the internet through Nintendo Switch Online or local Wi-Fi, you will receive the black Flying-type marker on the map to find Blaziken.

 Blaziken&#39;s Stats &amp; Abilities 
          

​​​​​​Going against Blaziken in its Pokémon Scarlet and Violet 7-Star Tera Raid can be challenging. This is because of Blaziken&#39;s immense Speed and Attack stat. Additionally, Blaziken&#39;s hidden ability, Speed Boost, increases its move priority in battle, letting it quickly attack twice in one turn during this raid. When choosing a Pokémon for battle against Blaziken, consider its original typing and move sets. This is because it uses Earthquake, a Ground-type move covering its Electric-type weakness for this Tera Raid.

 How To Beat Blaziken 7-Star Tera Raid (Solo) 
          

To solo the Blaziken 7-Star Tera Raid, consider using one of two Pokémon: Miraidon or Bellibolt. They are both super-effective counters to the Flying Tera-type Blaziken, which can take a very hard hit. Both of their strategies are very similar, using the move Parabolic Charge to hit Blaziken and heal themselves simultaneously. Additionally, before starting, reset the raid a few times until your NPC partners use a Pokémon with the ability Intimidate, which will lower Blaziken&#39;s Attack stat. YouTuber ConCon shows the sequence of using the best Miraidon build in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in battle and moves to watch out for from Blaziken.
