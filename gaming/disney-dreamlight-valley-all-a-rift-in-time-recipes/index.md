## Literature Review

The A Rift In Time DLC in Disney Dreamlight Valley is full of new food that can be combined into a vast number of recipes for every meal.





There are a lot of new things people can do in the A Rift In Time DLC, including moving villagers between the Valley and Eternity Isle. There are also a host of new characters, new villagers, and many new quests for players to spend time completing. All of this will take a lot of energy to complete, so the new recipes will help players get more done quickly.






The following recipes are categorized by meal type first, and list all necessary ingredients, the star level of the recipe, and the rewards that can be earned from meals, specifically the energy earned by eating them or the gold made by selling them.

 All New Dessert Recipes in Eternity Isle 
          

There are many new sweet tooth-fulfilling recipes in Eternity Isle, but some of them may be more dangerous than they seem given that they require you to find scorpions in Disney Dreamlight Valley to use as ingredients. This will pay off, however, as Gourmet Grubs will give you 5000 Energy to keep farming more ingredients and clear the valley of vines. Find enough Scorpions and you will never have to rest again.

And that&#39;s all the new recipes for now in the DIsney Dreamlight Valley DLC, A Rift In Time that players can cook and add to their collection. However, with all the new options available, players should be busy for quite some time as they seek out the ingredients and transport them to a cooking pot. With a little luck, the new recipes should help them befriend the new characters even faster in Eternity Isle.
