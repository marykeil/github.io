## Literature Review

There are 21 Assault Rifles to choose from in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, with the best being the MCW, which can give you a considerable edge.





While you will start with a few weapons at your disposal, the best Assault Rifles need to be unlocked. This can be done by using the fastest methods to earn XP in MW3 and leveling up in the game, granting you access to more weapons. While primarily useful in the Multiplayer mode, they can also be used in Zombies, which has received an extensive open-world overhaul.

Not even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#39;s open-world zombie mode can help revitalize a franchise that needed renovation instead of recycled ideas.












 








 7  M4 
All-Around AR


 







The M4 is a classic Modern Warfare gun that has been nearly ever-present throughout the series, making it familiar for most players. It has always been a popular gun due to its ease of use, which remains true in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
While not excelling in any individual areas, it is a great all-around gun that will perform well even before adding any attachments. 

The default M4 setup is best at mid-range, but it can be outmatched in close-quarters fights, up against SMG&#39;s or the very elite Assault Rifles. Players who have used the gun in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 can carry it over, but new players can also unlock it by completing an Operator Kill challenge.





 6  TAQ-56 
Best Handling AR
        

The TAQ-56 is another one of several guns carried across from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, meaning if you have unlocked it in the previous game, it will be available for you to use as soon as you reach level 4. However, if you haven&#39;t played the previous game, you will need to wait until level 55 before you can access it.
It is another good all-around gun that is effective for both aggressive play styles and in situations when you need to pick enemies off from afar. Its best stats are handling and fire rate, so attaching an additional magazine can be handy to ensure you don&#39;t run out of bullets quickly.





 5  Holger 556 
  Range Maverick
        

If you are most comfortable at close range but want the versatility that an Assault Rifle provides, the Holger 556 can come into its own. A powerful weapon that can quickly finish off enemies, it also has good accuracy, which makes it useful from further distances. It struggles with mobility and recoil compared to the other Assault rifle options on this list, so using attachments to improve it&#39;s shortcomings is vital if you plan to use the Holger 556.





 4  MTZ 556 
Best Long Range AR
        

The MTZ is one of the best all-around Assault Rifles in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, making it an excellent option for newer players to the series. You can unlock the gun at just level 12, meaning it&#39;s a great choice to use as you play through the levels until you unlock the very best Assault Rifles on offer. Its biggest strength is its ability from long range due to its accuracy stats, making it great on some of the larger maps. When using MTZ 556&#39;s best Loadout, it becomes even better at short, medium and long range.





 3  SVA 545 
Damage Beast


 







While most players aren&#39;t fans of burst-firing weapons, if you get used to it, the SVA 545 can be very effective in the early stages of Modern Warfare 3. It fires two bullets every time you shoot, meaning if you are on target, you will deal double damage. You can unlock it after just a few matches upon reaching level 4. While not the easiest to pick up, it&#39;s a very powerful option for those who can master it. The SVA 545 is proving to be another Meta weapon in the earlier stages of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer due to its high accuracy and fire rate combination.





 2  DG-58 
Best Burst Fire AR
        

Following the SVA 545 is the DG-58, another burst firing Assault Rifle. Often overlooked in games, they are more effective than previously in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, so it can be worth taking the time to learn how to use them. The DG-58 fires at the more traditional three-round burst, which is easier for players unfamiliar with the style to pick up.
The initial setup for the DG-58 already brings a lot of power; however, it can become nearly unstoppable with the right loadout. If equipped with the CDG T-25 Light Barrel, which further increases damage, the gun can kill enemies in one burst of bullets, giving opponents little time to react.





 1  MCW 
The Old Reliable


 







The current Meta Assault Rifle and overall best gun to use in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the MCW, following its popularity from the open Beta that was available before the game&#39;s launch. A take on the classic ACR, which has been commonplace in the Modern Warfare series. You will need to reach level 44 to unlock the MCW, but it is worth waiting for its short and mid-range strength.
The best MCW Loadout can make it stronger than the default setup. Its best stat is it&#39;s Time To Kill, meaning once you see an enemy, you can quickly dispatch them. It has low recoil and is simply the best all-round gun available in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
