## Literature Review

In Persona 5 Tactica, one of the many possible moves includes the Triple Threat Attack, which will form a triangle of fire around the partyâ€™s enemies





After Persona 5 Tactica was previewed earlier this year, it is now available on Game Pass for both Console and PC. Combat is a big part of this game, which revolves around party members that can be swapped in and out, as well as turn-based tactics. This guide will inform how players can perform the Triple Threat Attack.




                  &#34;Another Fun Spin-Off That Proves The Depth Of Its Source Material&#34;: Persona 5 Tactica Review   Persona 5 Tactica strikes a balance between XCOM-style tactical gameplay and the cozy, social dynamics of P5, making for a fun journey.   


 Performing the Triple Threat Attack in Persona 5 Tactica 
          

The Triple Threat Attack requires planning due to the nature of how it can be triggered. To trigger, three things must be true: you must have a downed enemy, that downed enemy must be in the center of three party members in a triangular formation, and one of those party members must have a One More move ready. This is a tricky combination to get right without a lot of planning beforehand.

The placement of the party characters is one of the easier things to control in the game, as Persona 5 Tactica is similar to Mario &#43; Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, and the characters can move more freely than in traditional turn-based games. There will be blue lines connecting each party member so that you can see the area that the triangle between them will cover. If you move the party members far apart on their turns and toward corners, it is more likely that you will capture an enemy in the trap.




The next two requirements take more effort to get right, as you will likely have to pick an enemy early in the turn to be able to down them and have time to get the One More action. Inflicting ailments or using Persona moves are the best ways to down an enemy. The One More action can be gained by chaining moves or using follow-up attacks.



A downed enemy must be removed from cover and have no resist stats to be considered in the &#34;downed&#34; state.

With all of that taken together, players should be able to get the Triple Threat Attack often in Persona 5 Tactica. Of note, it is possible to get multiple enemies in the range of fire of the Triple Threat, but even getting one enemy can make a difference. No matter how many enemies are in the line of fire, it is a very satisfying feeling to make all the pieces come together and see the fruit of your actions.
