## Literature Review

Disney Dreamlight Valley announced its roadmap for the coming year in a recent Showcase Event, particularly highlighting changes coming at launch.




Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s first-ever Showcase Event was held on November 1, 2023, and included many announcements regarding a roadmap of content coming to the game over the next year. DDV is leaving Early Access and launching as a full game, but that doesn&#39;t mean the developers are slowing down plans to release new content. Many new characters and even a full expansion for the game that doubles the size of the map are coming soon.
Disney Dreamlight Valley will be released on December 5, 2023, with a lot of new content being launched at that time in celebration, including another friend moving into the Valley and an all-new Star Path with lots of holiday-themed content. Much of the Showcase discussed the upcoming paid expansion, A Rift In Time, but many things are being added to the base game for free as well. The full Showcase Event can be viewed on Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s YouTube page, but here are some of the highlights of everything to come to the game over the next year.

 10  Official DDV Soundtrack 
Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, And More
        

The music in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a beautiful soundtrack that has distinct peaceful instrumental tracks for each biome, home, and area located around the Valley. Now, the Disney Dreamlight Valley Original Video Game Soundtrack is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Amazon Music Unlimited, Pandora, and more. The soundtrack includes 23 songs totaling 50 minutes of music from the game.





 9  Disney Dreamlight Valley Leaves Early Access For Full Release 
Founder&#39;s Packs Available Until December 5, 2023


 







For over a year now, Disney Dreamlight Valley has been in Early Access and required the purchase of early edition Founder&#39;s Packs to play the game during that time. On December 5, 2023, the Early Access period will come to a close, and the game will be released in full. Several editions of the game are available for purchase, including the physical release of the Cozy Edition.
Anyone with a Founder&#39;s Pack will not need to repurchase the game and will receive all the cosmetic rewards of a Gold Edition plus 2,500 Moonstones, regardless of which tier their Founder&#39;s Pack was purchased at. Founder&#39;s Packs are still available until December 5th, after which the regular versions of the game will be available.





 8  Winter Star Path Begins December 5 
Star Paths Extended Beyond Early Access
        

A Star Path in Disney Dreamlight Valley is similar to a battle pass in other games, where, for a limited time, there are specific quests that players can complete to earn exclusive rewards. The Star Path has both a free track for all players and a Premium track that is purchased with Moonstones and has additional quests. Despite some rumors that the Star Paths would not be continuing after the full launch of the game, a new Winter Star Path will begin on release day, December 5. It has not been revealed what the rewards for this Star Path will be other than that it has a winter holiday theme.





 7  Disney Dreamlight Valley Is Coming To Apple Arcade 
iPhone, iPad, And Apple TV
        

Anyone with an Apple Arcade subscription will be able to play Disney Dreamlight Valley Arcade Edition on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Mac starting on December 5. This version of the game includes the base game, optimized for touch screens, and the A Rift in Time expansion but will not include any Star Paths or Premium Shop content. Gameloft has confirmed that this version will not support cross-saves, however, so players cannot swap between playing on different platforms.





 6  Jack Skellington Is Moving To The Valley 
Tim Burton&#39;s The Nightmare Before Christmas


 







Although the Pumpkin King is arriving a bit late for Halloween, Jack Skellington from Tim Burton&#39;s The Nightmare Before Christmas will be available in Disney Dreamlight Valley beginning on December 5. During the Showcase Event, it was said that players should &#34;keep an eye on the Valley&#39;s most moody biome for hints of his arrival,&#34; which suggests that he will not be coming from one of the doors in the Dream Castle. Jack Skellington marks the eighth major content addition to come to the game since it launched in Early Access last year.





 5  New Story Content For Dreamlight Valley 
New Characters To Be Introduced Not much has been revealed about whether the base game will have any ongoing narrative in Disney Dreamlight Valley, but ultimately, the story of the Forgotten was only the beginning. The new paid expansion A Rift In Time will take the story to the Eternity Isle for three acts of narrative related to Jafar and his interference with time itself. Even without the paid DLC, there will be multiple new characters arriving to the base game over the course of 2024 which will have their own side quests and story as well as unique realms that players can visit.





 4  Mike Wazowski And Sulley Are Coming 
Monsters, Inc. Characters Arrive Early 2024
        

Not long after Jack Skellington&#39;s arrival, some monstrous new faces will also join Disney Dreamlight Valley from the Monsters, Inc. realm. Mike Wazowski and Sulley will be unlocked during the coming winter months, early in 2024. To convince them to move to the Valley, players will have to travel to the Laugh Floor of Pixar&#39;s Monsters, Inc. and solve some problems that the two are encountering there.





 3  Tiana Is Joining Disney Dreamlight Valley In Summer 2024 
Princess And The Frog
        

Another beloved Disney princess will be joining the neighborhood in the summer, with the introduction of Tiana from The Princess and the Frog when her Realm Door opens. Sure to be a good friend to the current chef of the Valley, Remy, Tiana will bring New Orleans-inspired culinary delights to the area. Either she and Remy will be best friends, or perhaps there will be a little competition, but either way, it is certain to be entertaining seeing the two of these foodies go head-to-head.





 2  Rift In Time Expansion Pass Adds Tons Of Content To Dreamlight Valley 
Three New Biomes


 







Disney Dreamlight Valley is launching alongside a full Expansion Pass that has three acts full of content. As a $30 expansion, this is not just a small bit of DLC but adds a new island called Eternity Isle that is as large as the current Valley in the game and has three new biomes. These biomes are called Ancient&#39;s Landing, Glittering Dunes, and Wild Tangle. Each is filled with new resources such as fantasy figs and cinnamon, animals such as monkeys and capybaras, and new plants to grow and cultivate. The Eternity Isle will also have a separate object count, so players can decorate without fear of having to remove items from the Valley.


A Rift In Time brings new characters to the cast of NPCs who will be able to either live in Eternity Isle or move to the original Valley. These include EVE from Wall-E, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, and Rapunzel from Tangled, as well as two additional characters that have yet to be announced. Another new feature for the expansion is Ancient Machines, which will let players automate watering plants and cooking meals.





 1  New ValleyVerse Mode Lets Players Share With Their Friends 
Four Player Multiplayer


 







Multiplayer is coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley with a new ValleyVerse mode. This will allow players to invite up to three friends to visit their Valley, exchange items with each other, and hang out. Guests can shop at Scrooge McDuck&#39;s store, which will offer different items in each location, while players get to finally show off their decorating styles. Developers say that this multiplayer mode in Disney Dreamlight Valley will continue to evolve, so more ways to play with friends will be coming in future updates, although they have not made it clear yet if multiplayer will support cross-platform play.
