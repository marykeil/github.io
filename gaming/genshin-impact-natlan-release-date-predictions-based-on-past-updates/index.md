## Literature Review

Although HoYoverse has not revealed the release date for Natlan in Genshin Impact, it is possible to predict exactly when it will arrive.




The exact release date for Natlan in Genshin Impact is unknown, but it is possible to predict a time frame in which the new area will be added to the live-service game. Natlan is the sixth Nation of Teyvat to arrive to HoYoverse’s RPG and its reigning element is Pyro, the title’s equivalent to fire. Natlan has been mentioned a few times before and is expected to be introduced in 2024, as was previously announced by the developer in its post-release calendar. Nevertheless, it does not yet have an established release date. The focus, for now, is on Fontaine and the updates that are pertinent to the land of Hydro.




This article contains SPOILERS about Genshin Impact.

In 2023, HoYoverse added Fontaine to Genshin Impact, substantially increasing the size of the playable map, as well as allowing players to attune the Traveler to Hydro, meet a full roster of new characters, and experience a regional storyline through Archon Quests, which connects to the larger and overimpending narrative arc. Some details were already known about Natlan, but with the events that took place in Version 4.2, more information about the Nation of Pyro was revealed, as the Traveler prepares to set off to the next destination in their journey searching for their lost sibling – even if that may still take a while.

 Neuvillette Revealed More Details About Natlan In Genshin Impact 
         




The information about Natlan was revealed by the Hydro Dragon Sovereign, Neuvillette, after the main boss fight against the All-Devouring Narwhal and the conversation with Skirk in Genshin Impact. The location came up in a conversation with the Traveler as they got ready to depart from Fontaine and head over to the next region to continue their search for their sibling. While Neuvillette did brush over a few details that were already known, he did offer more insight into what players can expect once they arrive in the Nation of Natlan. However, it may be a few months before players gain access to the region of Pyro.

Although Natlan does not have a definitive release date so far, as the content itself is likely still under development, it is possible to predict when HoYoverse plans on releasing it. Natlan’s release is likely connected to Genshin Impact 5.0, but that does not necessarily mean that the game will go all the way through Version 4.9 before heading into the big annual update. In fact, leading up to Fontaine’s release in Version 4.0, the title effectively skipped Version 3.9, which means that similar behavior can occur during the current year of content.






The year before, HoYoverse also skipped Version 2.9 before entering Version 3.0 and the release of Sumeru.




There is a regular six-week schedule between Genshin Impact updates and, based on this, it is possible to predict that the release date of Natlan via Version 5.0 will occur on August 28, 2024. Of course, this is if Version 4.9 is taken out of the rotation, as the most recent x.9 patches have not occurred. This also takes into consideration that the game’s updates will not suffer any delays – there have been no content delays since Version 2.7, and ever since then, the game has been steadily and promptly receiving new patches of content every six weeks.

The August 2024 release date prediction for Natlan is also in line with most of the big annual updates for Genshin Impact. They always occur in the Summer: Fontaine’s release in Version 4.0 occurred on August 14, while Sumeru’s addition via Version 3.0 happened on August 24, 2022. While the August 28, 2024 release date for Natlan is impossible to concretely determine right now, it seems like the most accurate prediction based on prior releases and the game’s schedule.






Inazuma’s release with Version 2.0 is the only exception, having arrived on July 21, 2021 – but that was before Version 2.7 and its delay, which pushed back all subsequent updates.

 Story Details About Natlan In Genshin Impact 
          

In Teyvat, Natlan is the Nation of Teyvat that is ruled by the element of Pyro in Genshin Impact. As had already been determined and then further reinforced by Neuvillette’s conversation at the end of the Archon Quests in Version 4.2, Natlan is also Nation of war and one that is continuously plagued by the conflicts that take place there. According to Neuvillette, his intelligence reported to him that the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain is invested in the clashes in Natlan and has “thrown his hat into the nation&#39;s endless ring of war.” Exactly what that means is still unknown.




However, considering the Snezhnayan group’s modus operandi and its continuous efforts to infiltrate Nations, it is possible to speculate a little bit about what is going on. It is likely that, once again, the Fatui Harbinger in Genshin Impact will instigate internal conflicts and further expand the Fatui’s imperialistic grasp on foreign nations. Aside from the presence of the Fatui and their possible endorsement of a proxy war, there were other details revealed about Natlan when talking to Neuvillette at the end of Version 4.2’s main Archon Quests – also known as the “Finale” mission in Chapter IV: Act 5.

According to Neuvillette, Natlan is a region of dragons. However, these creatures are not the elemental dragons, like Neuvillette or Apep in Genshin Impact, but lesser life species. It is expected that they will be more like vishaps, which are encountered in Liyue, for instance. The dragons in Natlan have evolved and learned to coexist with humanity, which may even mean they integrate parts of the tribes that compose the social structure of the area. Natlan is said to be located west of Sumeru, beyond the Great Red Sand. The game also mentions that Natlan has several hot springs that were created from the severe volcanic activity in the region.




It is known that Natlan has had at least two Pyro Archons, one of which is called Murata. She is also known as the Lady of Fire, though her status is a mystery – in fact, it has been over 1,000 years since Murata’s status was a secret. Other than the smaller pieces of trivia spread across Teyvat and the recent revelations by Neuvillette, little else is known about Natlan so far. More information about the land of Pyro should be shared as the game progresses, and it grows closer to Genshin Impact 5.0.
