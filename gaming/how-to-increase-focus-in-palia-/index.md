## Literature Review

In Palia players will want to expedite their XP gain as much as possible, which can be done by increasing their Focus Bar for max potential.





Before playing Palia, there are several good things to know about how the game works. Focus differs slightly between Palia and similar games such as Animal Crossing or Minecraft. Focus will determine how much XP you earn from doing various tasks, and the more you fill your Focus Bar, the better.






You will lose Focus once it has been spent completing a task. The Focus you use boosts any amount of experience gained by a percentage determined by how full the Focus Bar is.

 How To Raise Focus In Palia 
          

To temporarily increase your Focus, such as before mining or fishing, you should eat something. Most foods, even regular ingredients, will at least grant some Focus designated by a purple arrow in the upper right-hand corner of a food item in your inventory. Prepared Dishes, however, will give you the most Focus, and players may want to start a crop farm in Palia to prepare these dishes regularly.




To permanently increase your Focus, you will have to spend Renown at the Dragon Shrine. The first time you visit the Dragon Shrine, you will get a free upgrade from 200 Max Focus to 300. Afterward, it will cost 100 Renown to increase it by 50, although that number does decrease after reaching a certain point shown in the table below:

  Starting Max Focus   Renown Needed To Upgrade   Increase Amount    200   Free Upgrade   &#43;100    300-500   100   &#43;50    500-750   100   &#43;25    750-1000   100   &#43;10   



Increasing the bonus received from the Focus Bar when used is also possible in Palia. This can also be done by spending Renown, but this will have to be performed at the Phoenix Shrine. While you start with a 20% Focus Bonus, as with the Dragon Shrine, the first visit is free, raising your bonus to 25%. The Max Bonus is 100%, which has a similar progression to the Dragon Shrine.




  Starting Focus Bonus   Renown Needed To Upgrade   Percentage Increase    20%   Free Upgrade   &#43;5%    25%-50%   100   &#43;5%    50%-75%   100   &#43;2.5%    75%-100%   100   &#43;1%   



Both increases will take 4000 Renown each to fully maximize. While it will not take as many visits to the shrine to increase the Focus Bonus to its maximum potential, it is generally advised to level them equally. This will ensure you are getting the benefits of the Bonus while not having to destroy your stores of food, such as the tasty Macarons in Palia, to do so. Either way, gaining Focus is one of the best things players can do to progress the game faster.
