## Literature Review

Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is out in select retailers, and some cards are already commanding high prices on the secondary market.




Rise of the Floodborn adds a huge batch of new cards to Disney Lorcana, and it&#39;s no surprise that some are immediately commanding high values on the secondary market. Supply issues that plagued Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter spiked demand for cards that were uncommon or especially effective, and at least some of this momentum inherently carries over to Rise of the Floodborn. Card values are likely to fluctuate heavily over time, but the launch of the expansion in local game stores is as good a time as any to look at the market.
Drip-fed reveals of cards built anticipation for Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn since the expansion was announced in September, and some immediately stood out as likely power players in the current meta. Others gain extra appeal thanks to charming or humorous takes on iconic characters, as plenty of Disney favorites are making appearances on the new cards. Regardless of the reason for their value, none of the most popular Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn cards are going to come cheap.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana&#39;s Rise of the Floodborn Starter Decks Review 
Disney Lorcana&#39;s Rise of the Floodborn starter decks feel like an ideal entry point to the trading card game, and new mechanics feel interesting.












 








 10  Snow White: Well Wisher 
25/204, Amber


 







The very first Disney Princess gets an excellent Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn card with Snow White: Well Wisher, which depicts her smiling as doves alight on her outstretched hands. Whenever she quests, a player can return a character card from the discard pile into their hand, a way to potentially draw powerful options back into the fold. As a Legendary, she isn&#39;t the easiest card to get, as reflected by a price of $18.89 on TCGPlayer.
Prices for Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn cards will fluctuate over time. Some of these prices may differ from the existing prices on TCGPlayer. 






 9  Sisu: Divine Water Dragon 
159/204, Sapphire
        

Sisu: Divine Water Dragon is a powerful tool for any Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn Control deck with Sapphire cards. Her I Trust You ability lets a player look at the top two cards of a deck and take one into their hand every time she quests, generating plenty of card draw and making it easier to get a specific target. The artwork depicts the titular dragon of Raya and the Last Dragon springing from a watery surface with a smile on her face. As a Legendary, it&#39;s not too easy to find, and TCGPlayer lists the current market value for Sisu: Divine Water Dragon at $31.96.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards 
Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is releasing soon, with new cards arriving via Illumineer&#39;s Troves, Gift Sets, and more in this second set.








 8  Fairy Godmother: Mystic Armorer 
41/204, Amethyst
        

Cinderella&#39;s magical benefactor gets a Legendary card with Fairy Godmother: Mystic Armorer, which shows her conjuring up a beautifully intricate sword. Whenever she quests, her other characters gain extra strength and can return to the player&#39;s hand when banished, making her the key support for a strong offensive force. A shift ability lets this combo nicely with Fairy Godmother: Here to Help. On TCGPlayer, the current market value for the card is $32.56.





 7  Beast: Tragic Hero 
173/204, Steel
        

Beast: Tragic Hero is a Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn draw card, allowing for an extra draw for any turn that it starts undamaged. If Beast has taken a hit, he transforms into a powerful offensive force instead with a &#43;4 to Strength. All of this gameplay value is bolstered by a Shift 3 ability that makes it possible to get him out early for real devastation. His Legendary status adds extra luster to his market value, currently reflected by an impressive $33.19 on TCGPlayer.





 6  Cinderella: Stouthearted 
117/204, Steel
        

Cinderella: Stouthearted is an especially appealing Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn card for any deck with Steel, as this high-cost card has exceptional defensive abilities. With a current value of $39.87 on TCGPlayer, it&#39;s clear that her market price is reflecting her gameplay viability. It&#39;s also a cool card for any fans of the character, depicting her in shining armor that makes for a stark contrast to her more common blue ball gown or the simple dress she wears before the Fairy Godmother visits.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Enchanted Cinderella Reveal [EXCLUSIVE] 
Screen Rant exclusively reveals a new Enchanted Storyborn Cinderella card coming to Disney Lorcana’s second set, Rise of the Floodborn.








 5  Mufasa: Betrayed Leader 
14/204, Amber
        

Mufasa: Betrayed Leader might be the most emotional card in Disney Lorcana, depicting Simba&#39;s father in the scene that broke millions of hearts. Having this Legendary in a deck won&#39;t be much of a heartbreaker, however, with The Sun Will Set ability making it possible to trigger the deployment of an extra card when Mufasa is banished. As an easily noteworthy Rise of the Floodborn Amber card, TCGPlayer currently lists Mufasa: Betrayed Leader at a market value of $40.92.
            
 
 Everything In Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Illumineer&#39;s Trove 
Similar to The First Chapter of Disney Lorcana, its second set, Rise of the Floodborn, will include an Illumineer’s Trove full of great products.








 4  Beast: Relentless 
70/204, Emerald
        

The Legendary status of Beast: Relentless makes it a bit hard to stumble across in a random Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn pack, and the Second Wind ability increases the difficulty of turning to the secondary market for an affordable purchase. Damaging opposing characters through any means makes it possible to ready this card, giving it the possibility of multiple extra actions in a single turn. A dynamic rendition of the Beast hanging off a castle balcony in a storm makes for a more action-oriented scene than Beast: Tragic Hero, adding a nice little bonus to a card tracking at $44.99 on TCGPlayer.





 3  Alice: Growing Girl 
137/204, Sapphire


 







Like Belle: Strange but Special, a highlight card from Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter, Alice is all about exponential power. Her Good Advice ability stacks Strength quickly, which can also transform into a major boost to Lore when it hits a high enough threshold. Combining that with a Legendary rarity and art of a fan-favorite Disney character is an easy recipe for popularity, reflected in a $48.05 value as represented on TCGPlayer.





 2  Scar: Vicious Cheater 
125/204, Ruby
        

Scar: Vicious Cheater is an especially aggressive Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn card. A Rush ability lets him take an immediate offensive, which can then be backed up by the ability to ready after banishing other characters in challenges. The art of this Legendary card depicts Scar atop a giant skull in the elephant graveyard from The Lion King, emphasizing this devious usurper&#39;s menacing might. On TCGPlayer, it currently commands a market value of $58.19.





 1  Belle: Hidden Archer 
72/204, Emerald


 







It&#39;s no particular surprise that Belle: Hidden Archer tops the list of the most expensive Rise of the Floodborn cards, as this Legendary packs a serious punch. Any opponent who wants to challenge this character will have to discard their full hand to do so, making it hard to stop her effective lore generation without a Banish card or a major sacrifice. Belle: Strange but Special was a favorite of The First Chapter, and TCGPlayer&#39;s listed $76.97 market price that Belle: Hidden Archer is commanding in Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn continues a winning streak for the bookish Beauty.
