# 70% Of Baldurs Gate 3 Players Are Being Cowards For No Reason


## SUMMARY 



  Just 30% of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players are using illithid powers in Act 1, missing out on great abilities.   Fear of transforming into a mind flayer may stop many players from using illithid powers.   While roleplaying is an understandable reason not to use illithid powers, there are no consequences in terms of game mechanics for using them.

## Literature Review

Recent statistics released from Larian Studios show that the majority of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players are not using a key source of cool powers.




Baldur’s Gate 3 offers the opportunity to have amazing powers, with magic and powerful items at the party’s fingertips. However, one source of these awesome abilities is being ignored by a surprising number of players. While there could be a few reasons for this, those people are missing out on some great powers that could help save Faerûn.

Larian Studios, the developers of Baldur’s Gate 3, have been putting out interesting statistics on its social media accounts since the game was launched. These show everything from the class that has been played the most to how many people have reached the end of Baldur’s Gate 3 so far. However, the developer&#39;s latest batch of stats has some surprising numbers when it comes to an opportunity for player characters to gain more powers.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Only 30% Of Players Are Using Illithid Powers 
          




In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) Larian Studios revealed that “By Act 2, 30.4% of players have given in to their illithid side and flexed their powers.” This means that almost a whopping 70% of players are not using any illithid powers in Act 1 and therefore missing out of some great abilities. Considering there are no downsides to using the tadpoles that the party has, it seems odd that so many would deliberately leave themselves underpowered.



 Fear Of Transforming Into A Mind Flayer Stops Many BG3 Players 
          

While it would be easy to dismiss Larian’s statistics as people simply not understanding the illithid parasites, it instead reveals just how good a job the writing team did at conveying the consequences of using them within the context of BG3&#39;s story. Over and over, characters like Lae’zel and Wyll warn against giving in to the mind flayer hitchhikers currently nestled in the party’s heads. The other side to this argument is presented by Gale and Astarion, who want to learn how to use them and control them, although they have differing reasons for doing so.




The choice is presented to the player as not only a moral one, but one that will have grave consequences for their lives. However, when it comes to actual game mechanics, it doesn’t actually matter if the tadpoles are used or not. No NPCs will comment on the illithid powers or refuse to ally with the party because of their use, and the story itself remains unchanged.


 

It isn’t until Act 3, when the Emperor presents the option to use the Astral-Touched Tadpole, that the more significant consequences for using the illithid powers occur. But even then, they are mostly cosmetic – aside from a few comments from companions, nothing bad happens if the transformation to part illithid takes place. So why might people be avoiding the illithid powers that BG3 offers them?






 The Reasons Why Players May Shy Away From Using BG3’s Illithid Powers 
         

Part of the reason might be fear, as few would want their carefully crafted BG3 character to become a mind flayer. This again speaks to the strength in the writing that so many would believe that using the powers the tadpoles offer will result in them failing a check or triggering a cut scene that would suddenly transform them. However, there is another perfectly valid reason not to use the illithid powers offered; roleplay.

There are many types of characters who would shy away from using the mind flayer tadpoles. For example, it wouldn’t make sense for a githyanki Tav to suddenly start using the ghaik tadpole, as it would go against everything they believed in and had been taught. A lawful paladin or cleric might also shun these illithid powers as evil, while a power-hungry sorcerer might embrace them wholeheartedly.




Not using the illithid powers for roleplay reasons makes complete sense, as BG3 is a roleplaying game. Players are encouraged to place themselves in the role of their character and respond to the events presented to them accordingly. The alternative is that every playthrough ends up being the same as all the same choices are made, which is really boring.

 BG3’s Illithid Parasites Offer Some Great Powers 
         

There are many benefits to using the illithid powers in Baldur’s Gate 3 and some of the options are great. The abilities are unlocked in tiers, with some requiring others to be unlocked first before they can be chosen. To begin with, all characters will have one illithid power unlocked, Illithid Persuasion, which forces cultists of the Absolute to obey commands of a &#34;True Soul,&#34; as they call those in possession of a tadpole.




The basic illithid powers can be unlocked by finding mind flayer parasites throughout the game and opening up the special in-game menu to add them. There are 16 in total, including Illithid Persuasion, with five powers in the inner tier immediately available without any prerequisites. The various powers take different forms, such as passive features, reactions, and actions, with all the combat focused powers dealing psychic damage.

It is not until the end of Act 2, just before the party fully enters Act 3, that the next tier of elite illithid powers can be accessed. This requires the use of the Astral-Touched Tadpole, which will transform the character that uses it partially into a mind flayer. Again, people may be concerned that this will affect their playthrough negatively; however, aside from black veins on the character&#39;s face, there appears to be no downside to choosing to use this special parasite.






If tadpoles had been spent on any of the five abilities unlocked by the Astral-Touch Tadpole, those parasites are refunded and can be applied to other powers.




At each level, there are some fantastic powers to be gained for all classes, with one of the best being the ability to levitate, which lets the character fly around the map using their movement speed and doesn&#39;t cost an action. This is unlocked automatically by accepting the Astral-Touched Tadpole from the Emperor along with the five illithid powers from the inner tier: Concentrated Blast, Favourable Beginnings, Force Tunnel, Psionic Overload, and Transfuse Health. Of these, Favourable Beginnings is one beginnings as it allows the character to gain a bonus equal to their proficiency bonus on the first attack roll or ability check made against a target.

Overall the illithid powers in BG3 are a benefit to any playthrough. As with so many things in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, however, the choice is entirely personal and unique to each character. Perhaps as more players experiment with them and realize that they will not spontaneously turn into mind flayers, the number will rise from 30.4%.
