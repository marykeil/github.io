## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty feature a ton of great weapons - none cooler than the incredibly powerful and often stunning Iconic weapons.




Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC added a plethora of new armaments to the dangerous world of Night City. While many of these new bladed, blunt, and ballistic weapons are not especially special, some of the new Iconic weapons are absolutely fantastic, devastatingly deadly, and simply super cool. These new Iconic weapons, and those from the base game, represent the pinnacle of V&#39;s arsenal, and while they are all deadly, some are far cooler than others.
CD Projekt RED&#39;s Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, Phantom Liberty, is an incredible expansion to the base game. The unpredictable spy-thriller storyline and all the content that comes with it makes Phantom Liberty an essential add-on for fans of Cyberpunk 2077. Though the new content contains entertaining quests, immersive gameplay, and a plethora of other wonderful new features, one of the undeniable highlights of the Phantom Liberty DLC is the expanded arsenal of incredibly powerful and cool weapons. Though they are, in many cases, even cooler than those to originate in the base game, they are not all worth the time and effort to obtain.

 10  Volkodav (Iconic Machete) 
Inflicts Burn That Ensures Subsequent Attacks Are Critical Hits


 







In the lore of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC, the Iconic machete, Volkodav was part of a special Techtronika weapon series that was banned due to a number of humanitarian concerns - reasonably so when considering the weapon&#39;s Iconic modifier. Volkodav grants V a chance to inflict a unique burn on every enemy it touches; furthermore, striking any enemy affected by Volkodav&#39;s unique burn will deal Critical Damage. An Iconic variant of the Razor, the Volkodav can be acquired in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty during the side gig &#34;Waiting for Dodger&#34; where it can be found in the Police Station.





 9  Widow Maker (Iconic Precision Rifle) 
Fires Extra Projectiles &amp; Poisons Enemies
        

One of the best precision rifles in Cyberpunk 2077, Widow Maker is an Iconic variant of the Militech M-179e Achilles. With a blueish hue, light blue accents, and a Wraith decal on the receiver, the Widow Maker is one of the most exceptionally well-designed weapons in the game. Beyond its beauty, the Widow Maker&#39;s Iconic modifier ensures that it is deadly. Widow Maker fires an extra projectile, in a hexagonal pattern, each time it is discharged. It also inflicts 10% extra damage with charged shots, or an additional 50% when fully charged. Moreover, the Widow Maker&#39;s damage type is Chemical, and as a result, it has an increased chance of poisoning enemies.





 8  Wild Dog (Iconic Light Machine Gun) 
Steadily Increases Fire Rate &amp; Critical Hit Chance
        

The Iconic Light Machine Gun, Wild Dog, comes with an incredibly useful Iconic modifier that increases its fire rate by 0.06% and crit chance by 5% for a period of 12 seconds each time an enemy is struck, this effect can be stacked up to 50 times. Furthermore, melee damage is increased by 200% if the magazine is empty. Beyond this, Wild Dog has a 100% increased chance of knockdown, but a slower reload time - increased by 33%. Wild Dog, is an Iconic variant of the Constitutional Arms Defender. It can be acquired in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty during the main job &#34;Firestarter&#34; after it is dropped by Kurt Hansen.
Hansen will drop Wild Dog irrespective of which side is chosen between Songbird and Reed. 






 7  Guillotine X-MOD2 (Iconic Submachine Gun) 
Increases Headshot Damage
        

An Iconic variant of the Budget Arms Guillotine, the Guillotine x-MOD2 is a fantastic Iconic weapon. The Iconic Submachine Gun comes with some incredibly helpful Iconic modifiers - most significantly, an increased headshot damage multiplier of 25% and a dramatic boost of 25% to the weapon&#39;s effective range. Furthermore, the Guillotine x-MOD2 is capable of having up to two extra mods installed. A new weapon added in Phantom Liberty, the Guillotine x-MOD2 can be found in a container home in Longshore Stacks. Though the container home&#39;s door is locked and requires 20 Body to open, the Iconic Submachine Gun can be reached through the container home&#39;s window if V breaks the glass.





 6  Order (Iconic Double-Barrel Shotgun) 
Kills All Enemies Within Range If Sufficiently Charged
        

Order is an Iconic variant of the DB-2 Satara. Introduced in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Order comes with one incredibly powerful Iconic modifier, the ability to charge the weapon above 66%, which results in an enormously deadly blast that kills all enemies in its path. Unlike many Iconic weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 or its DLC Phantom Liberty, Order can be acquired through commerce and is purchasable at the EBM Petrochem Stadium.





 5  Errata (Iconic Katana) 
Lets V Leap Toward Enemies When Attacking


 







Added to the base game of Cyberpunk 2077 during Patch 2.0, the devastatingly sharp blade, Errata, is an Iconic variant of the Katana, and now one of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s most powerful melee weapons. Errata offers V the ability, while wielding it, to leap toward enemies and inflict extraordinary amounts of damage as well as a 30% burn chance to enemies when hit - moreover, attacking burning enemies guarantees critical damage. Errata can be found at the Electric Corporation power plant forge during the main job &#34;Disasterpiece.&#34;





 4  Gris-Gris (Iconic Revolver) 
Uploads Random Quickhacks To Struck Enemies
        

An Iconic variant of the DR-12 Quasar, the Iconic Tech Revolver Gris-Gris is one of the most powerful Revolvers in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Featuring an Iconic modifier that gives each hit a 5% chance to upload a random quickhack to the stricken enemy, Gris-Gris can easily disorient or dispatch enemies - notably, the Iconic modifier chance is halved against bosses. Gris-Gris&#39; reload time is also increased by 10% over the DR-12 Quasar base model. The Iconic Tech Revolver Gris-Gris can be obtained from Slider&#39;s Hideout where it is located in an open gun case in the locked-off section that can only be opened with the Slider&#39;s hideout storage room key.

 2  Gwynbleidd (Iconic Sword) 
Deals Extra Damage To Bosses
        

Gwynbleidd is an Iconic Sword in Phantom Liberty, and an excellent reference to one of the developer&#39;s other franchises, The Witcher. Featuring a few incredible Iconic modifiers that make Gwynbleidd quite possibly the best-bladed weapon in Cyberpunk 2077 - they include Iconic modifiers that allow Gwynbleidd to inflict extra damage against bosses, temporarily grant V guaranteed critical hits when killing enemies in quick succession, and if V&#39;s Health is critically low, all attacks with Gwynbleidd are guaranteed critical hits. Gwynbleidd can only be unlocked if the player has both The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on their GOG Galaxy platform. If they do, Gwynbleidd will be automatically added to V&#39;s stash.





 1  Rasetsu (Iconic Sniper Rifle) 
Fires Projectiles Which Travel Through Enemies


 







Rasetsu is an Iconic sniper rifle added to Cyberpunk 2077 in Phantom Liberty. Manufactured by Tsunami Defense Systems, Rasetsu is undoubtedly the game&#39;s best sniper, and quite possibly the game&#39;s best weapon overall - primarily as a result of its Iconic modifiers. Rasetsu has an Iconic modifier that allows V to fire charged shots which will penetrate through multiple enemies at once and its shots even have a chance to turn midair to hit enemies that were out of the original line of fire.
Another unique feature of this Iconic sniper rifle is how it aims. Unlike other snipers in Cyberpunk 2077, Rasetsu is not aimed with its scope, but instead, it zooms in and alters V&#39;s first-person view. Rasetsu is automatically obtained by V after completing the gauntlet at the Black Sapphire during the main job &#34;You Know My Name.&#34; Though it is debatable if it is the undeniable king of Cyberpunk weapons, Rasetsu is unquestionably the coolest Iconic Weapon in Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC.
