## Literature Review

New Phase 2 banner leaks for Genshin Impact 4.3 may debunk previous leaks. The information is sustained by another set of leaks regarding Chevreuse.




The Genshin Impact 4.3 Phase 2 banner leaks are suddenly making a lot more sense, considering another set of important leaks that have shown up. The upcoming version is going to continue the Traveler’s adventure through Fontaine, though the main Archon Quests revolving around the region’s plight have been resolved with the current update. In fact, there was a major lore bomb in Genshin Impact 4.2 that could have great repercussions in the future. Even though the biggest compilation of leaks happened before the release of Version 4.0 and the Nation of Hydro itself, HoYoverse’s RPG is still plagued by leaked information.




It is common for leaks to happen ahead of the release of each patch. Navia’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact leaked before her official release in Version 4.3, for instance. Videos unveiled her abilities and even animation set before the reveal by the developer in the respective livestream. The same happened with Chevreuse, a new 4-star character whose abilities were shown off ahead of time. Now, more solid leaks regarding the character banner structure for Version 4.3 have been shared – and sustained by other bits of alleged information, it seems like the leaked composition of the Phase 2 banners is accurate this time.

 Raiden Shogun &amp; Yoimiya May Be Featured In Phase 2 Banners Of Genshin Impact 4.3 
         




According to a new piece of information obtained by the leaker known as Waffel, later shared on Reddit, the stars of the Phase 2 banners in Genshin Impact 4.3 are going to be Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya. Both characters are from Inazuma. Raiden Shogun is the 5-star Electro Archon, a character that can operate as a main DPS, an off-field sub-DPS, and a battery support unit. Yoimiya, on the other hand, is a main DPS character, specializing in dealing Pyro DMG to opponents. Although they may seem like thoughtless reruns, the way they are organized in Phase 2 may actually be thoroughly justified by another 4.3 leak.



 Leaks Show Chevreuse Resonates With Pyro &amp; Electro Units In Genshin Impact 
          

The main reason that the Phase 2 leaks indicating that Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya are the highlighted rerun characters seem credible is due to Chevreuse’s own leaks. The new 4-star character has been confirmed by HoYoverse as a debuting hero in Version 4.3. The secret lies in Chevreuse’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact. According to the alleged information about her abilities, Chevreuse will be a support unit, capable of providing healing to the team, as well as buffs. The leaks show that the most meaningful of these buffs revolve around empowering other Pyro and Electro units in her team.




In fact, she gives bonuses out to those who trigger Overloaded reactions. The leaks indicate that Chevreuse’s Elemental Skill is a rifle shot that may fire something called an Overloaded Bullet, which deals more AoE (area of effect) damage and is created for her usage when the party triggers an Overloaded reaction. Because Chevreuse is a Pyro unit, at least one other Electro character has to be on the team to make this happen. Although this ability would only justify the rerun of Raiden Shogun in Genshin Impact, more details about her kit indicate her synergy with the Pyro element as well.

One of Chevreuse’s leaked Passive Talents indicates that, if the team is composed entirely of Pyro and Electro units, with at least one character of each element, she will activate the Synergized Tactics buff. With this buff, whenever an Overloaded reaction is triggered by the party, the enemy’s Pyro and Electro Resistances will be decreased for a total of six seconds. In addition to the previously mentioned Overloaded Bullet, this is another reason to make the team comp with Chevreuse circle around Overloaded Elemental Reactions in Genshin Impact – not only will she deal more damage, but she will allow her teammates to deal more damage to opponents.




Yet another detail about Chevreuse’s leaked gameplay kit seems to sustain that both Yoimiya and Raiden Shogun will be featured in Phase 2, along with her own debut. Another of Chevreuse’s Passive Talents allegedly boosts the ATK of Pyro and Electro units in her team by 1% of every 1,000 of Chevreuse’s Max HP, up to a 40% ATK boost. If this is true, this will consecrate Chevreuse as a support unit that works exclusively with Pyro and Electro characters in Genshin Impact – and having Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya running in banners with her makes perfect sense.

If players are lucky enough to pull any of the two 5-star heroes and Chevreuse, they may see a significant boost to their performance. Chevreuse’s kit is restricting, but it does seem to pay off, at least according to the leaks. Other 5-star characters that would work well with her in case the leaks are true are Hu Tao, Lyney, Cyno, and Yae Miko in Genshin Impact. Depending on how well she is built around her complicated scaling system, Dehya could also synergize with Chevreuse.






These names, however, have not been mentioned in the Version 4.3 leaks, so it is unlikely they will show up in the upcoming patch.






 Previous Banner Leaks For Genshin Impact 4.3 
          

Though the leaks regarding the reruns of Yoimiya and Raiden Shogun in the Phase 2 banners of Version 4.3 seem like solid bets, especially when backed up by the debut of Chevreuse and her alleged gameplay kit, there have been prior leaks that indicate otherwise. Some of the first Genshin Impact 4.3 character banner leaks showed that the lineup would be composed of Navia, Arataki Itto, Raiden Shogun, and Albedo. With the new information shared by leaker Waffel, it seems like the two 5-star Geo units were either discarded as rerun options for the upcoming patch, or the information was inaccurate.




Although reruns of Arataki Itto and Albedo are highly anticipated, especially considering the lack of options when it comes to Geo characters, players may have to wait a while longer before trying their luck when pulling for these characters in a future rerun. The fact that they do not resonate with Chevreuse as well as Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya is a major indicator that the second leak about the composition and order of the character banners in Genshin Impact 4.3 is accurate.

Although leaks have proven to be reliable over the past few months, especially near the release of Fontaine, they should always be taken with a grain of salt. The lineup of character banners can be inaccurate or subject to change ahead of a version’s release, especially regarding reruns. Nevertheless, the presence of Chevreuse and her alleged kit gives more credibility to the Phase 2 banners featuring Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya in Genshin Impact 4.3.
