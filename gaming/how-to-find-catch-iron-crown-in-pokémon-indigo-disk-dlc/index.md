## Literature Review

Catching Iron Crown in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet requires unlocking its encounter and locating it. Here&#39;s how to do it.





Instead of being a Steel- and Fighting-type creature, Iron Crown is a Steel- and Psychic Pokémon. Like most other futuristic Paradox Pokémon, Iron Crown maintains most of the structural design of its predecessor but substitutes its biological corporeal elements for various plaques of steel and tubes that contain some sort of liquid. In essence, Iron Crown is the robot version of Cobalion. Catching Iron Crown is vital to completing the Blueberry Pokédex in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, so knowing how to unlock the encounter and then find the Pokémon itself is of the utmost priority. Though Iron Crown is a Paradox Pokémon, it is given a Legendary treatment.




                  One New Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk DLC Was Hiding All Along   It seems like one of the new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk has been hiding in the base games, Scarlet and Violet, for over a year.   


 How To Unlock Iron Crown In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
         

To unlock the encounter with Iron Crown in the Indigo Disk DLC, you will first need to complete a side quest within Blueberry Academy. Once you take the elevator and descend into the Terarium, you may encounter the NPC named Perrin. This is the same photographer you met in Kitakami, and the one that allowed your encounter with Bloodmoon Ursaluna in Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC. By talking to her, she will greet you and send you off on another mission. This time, you are required to register 200 Pokémon in the Blueberry Pokédex. Once you have completed this task, you can return to Perrin at the Terarium’s entrance.






Iron Crown is exclusive to Pokémon Violet’s version of the Indigo Disk DLC. If you have Pokémon Scarlet, the equivalent creature you will unlock is Raging Bolt, Raikou’s ancient Paradox form.




By interacting with Perrin once again, she will show you the hint she has been keeping a secret. This comes in the form of two photographs. The first one will be a shot of Iron Boulder, Terrakion’s futuristic Paradox form that had not been publicized by Nintendo before the release of the expansion.

The second picture showcases Iron Crown overlooking the horizon at Area Zero. After that, Perrin will send you off on the journey to encounter both creatures featured in the photographs. She does not give you any additional hints, but they are both located in Area Zero, inside the Great Crater of Paldea.



The encounters with both Iron Boulder and Iron Crown are Shiny-locked. This means that, even though their Shiny versions are coded into the game itself, they are currently unobtainable through legal methods.









 Where To Find Iron Crown In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC (Iron Crown’s Location) 
          

Once you have registered all 200 required Pokémon in the Blueberry Pokédex and received the hint from Perrin in Pokémon Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC, you can head out and search for Iron Crown. It is impossible to see its exact location on a map, considering Area Zero’s Great Crater of Paldea does not have one.

Nevertheless, it is important to know that Iron Crown is located above the surface and not inside the cave. In fact, Iron Crown is very close to the entrance of Area Zero. Once you arrive, you can start heading left with your Miraidon mount and then jump into the small hole to your left.



The hole you need to jump through is somewhat blocked off by a series of small fences.







Once you fall and reach the next level, Iron Crown will be there standing alone. For further reference, Iron Crown is located in a corridor and overlooks the rest of Area Zero from its vantage point. To catch it, you will need to approach it and battle it. Its encounter is treated as a Legendary one, so you will need to interact with Iron Crown to initiate the fight. It is extremely recommended that you save the game before interacting with Iron Crown in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. This will allow you to hard reset the game and try the encounter once again in case you fail, for instance.



 Tips To Catch Iron Crown In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
          

In case you do not want to use the free Master Ball in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, obtained through a Mystery Gift distribution event, to immediately catch Iron Crown, you can try using a Quick Ball as soon as you initiate the encounter. This Poké Ball has a high catch rate at the very beginning of battles, so you may get lucky and catch the futuristic Paradox form of Cobalion without much of a fight. In case this fails, you will likely have to tackle the encounter like most other high-leveled Legendary Pokémon in the series. This means lowering its HP and trying to apply a status effect.




As was previously mentioned, Iron Crown is a Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon. This makes it weak against Ground-, Ghost-, Fire-, and Dark-type moves. It is also immune to Poison-type moves and being Poisoned. If you intend on using Super-effective hits by exploiting its weaknesses, be wary to not knock it out with a single hit.

Alternatively, you can try to play it safe by slowly decreasing its HP through moves that Iron Crown is resistant against. This includes Normal-, Flying-, Rock-, Steel-, Grass-, Psychic-, Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks. This method may take longer, but it may prevent you from having to restart the encounter in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.



Iron Crown takes a quarter of the damage from Psychic-type attacks, while the rest deal halved damage.




Iron Crown is at level 75, so you should bring a fairly resistant team to the encounter. Once you have lowered Iron Crown’s HP bar into the red zone, you can start showering it with your best Poké Balls. The recommendation is to use Ultra Balls. If dozens of rounds have already gone by, you can start using Timer Ball, which will increase your odds significantly. Catching Iron Crown in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet should not be too difficult – though you will need to make a trade or a Pokémon HOME transference if you are playing Pokémon Scarlet.
