## Literature Review

December 9th’s Wordle answer isn’t too hard to solve if players use some of their regular starting words and some contextual clues.





You can also use Wordle’s hard mode to solve daily puzzles, as it lets you develop new skills &amp; habits that you can use in the regular mode. In this mode, you will not be allowed to use previously confirmed letters in different spots, forcing you to think of words that fit the exact spelling. This can be time-consuming for some, but in the long run, it definitely helps in solving puzzles without taking a gamble on your streak.
