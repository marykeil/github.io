## Literature Review

In celebration of the upcoming release of The Indigo Disk DLC, you can now catch Darkrai, Dialga, and Palkia in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.





Instead of going on a field trip, however, you will be sent on an exchange program with Naranja and Uva Academies’ sister school, Blueberry Academy in the Unova region. This connection has already fueled a lot of speculation, including rumors about the Gen 5 Pokémon game remakes. Sinnoh Pokémon are unrelated to the DLC’s story and are already compatible with the Gen 9 games via transference from Pokémon HOME. Nevertheless, Scarlet and Violet are offering a chance for players to catch an extra copy of Darkrai, Dialga, and Palkia without natively in the game, without having to grab them from other games.




                  All Pokémon That Can Be Transferred To Scarlet &amp; Violet From HOME   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are getting over 100 creatures and forms not previously obtainable in the Generation 9 games. Here are all of them.   


 How To Catch Darkrai In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet (Darkrai Code For Mystery Gift) 
          

In order to grab the free copy of Darkrai in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you will need to use the Mystery Gift function. To do so, you should boot your game and open the main menu using the X button. After this, you will be required to connect to the internet by clicking on the L button on your Nintendo Switch. Once this has been done, access the Poké Portal through the main menu and then navigate toward the Mystery Gift function at the bottom of the page. There, you will need to select the option named “Get with Code/Password”.




As cited in the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, the Mystery Gift code for the free Darkrai is “NEWM00N1SC0M1NG”. Codes used in the Mystery Gift never contain the letters I, O, or Z, as stated in the official website and, as such, O is substituted by zero, while I is exchanged for one. After filling it in, the game will find the Mystery Gift. Then, you can claim the Darkrai. If your party has a free slot, Darkrai will be incorporated into it. If your party is full, however, Darkrai will be sent to your Boxes and will be inserted into the first available slot starting from Box 1.



After claiming your free copy of Darkrai, you should save your game. This will ensure the creature remains with you and excludes the chance of you losing the Mythical Pokémon by simply closing the game.




The distribution event for Darkrai is live until December 21, 2023, at 3:59 p.m. PST, according to the official website. Only one copy of the gift can be claimed per game account, so each player can only grab one instance of this special Darkrai. Nevertheless, multiple copies of Darkrai can be held in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet if you transfer more of them from Pokémon HOME. The Darkrai given out through this event comes within a special Cherish Ball, which is symbolic of distribution events and can have a Classic Ribbon equipped in the Memories section of its Summary, which grants it the “Darkrai the Pokémon Fan” title.




The free Darkrai comes at level 50 and has a Dark Tera Type – though that can be altered by using Tera Shards in Medali. The distribution event Darkrai knows the following moves: Dark Pulse, Shadow Ball, Hypnosis, and Dream Eater. These are some of its most classic moves, that either match its nightmarish reputation or are strong abilities to have. The creature has the Bad Dreams Ability, which causes it to damage enemy Pokémon that are asleep – this matches its Hypnosis move. Its stat distribution in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is considered “Amazing,” which could allow for easier building when maxing them out through EV (effort value) training.



 How To Catch Dialga &amp; Palkia In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
         

In addition to grabbing a free copy of Darkrai via the Mystery Gift, you will also be able to catch Dialga and Palkia, the mascot Legendaries from Gen 4’s Sinnoh region. Contrary to the simple method of redeeming them via the Mystery Gift, however, you will need to battle your way through special Tera Raid encounters and, if victorious, you will have a shot at catching them in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, as opposed to obtaining them through transferences made with Pokémon HOME. Both Dialga and Palkia are featured in special 5-star Tera Raid Battles for a limited time – their 5-star ranking indicates they will be somewhat easy.




For players who have completed the main campaign, the special Dialga and Palkia raids will appear on their maps. Alternatively, you can join these 5-star Tera Raids through the multiplayer function. In the Poké Portal, you can access the Tera Raid Battle function and find other players who are hosting sessions to face Dialga and Palkia.

The Tera Raid event featuring these Pokémon will occur until December 21, 2023, at 3:59 p.m. PST. Both Dialga and Palkia are Terastallized with a Dragon Tera Type. This makes them vulnerable to Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type moves, so be sure to bring Pokémon that have heavy-hitting attacks of these types.



Dragon-type Pokémon are strong against Dragon-type. Be wary of using a Dragon-type to counter Dialga and Palkia.




Only one copy of Dialga and Palkia each can be obtained through this specific Tera Raid event per save file. However, you can still participate in extra Tera Raid Battles against these Legendary creatures for the rewards that the encounters grant. Their presence in this event is extremely limited and, while Nintendo alerts that they may be featured in future events, there is no way of knowing that they will for sure. As such, it is best if you try to grab your copy of Dialga and Palkia in the game before the event ends. The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrives on December 14.
