## Literature Review

Debbie Aguero&#39;s son Julian B Lin was first introduced in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4 when he was against her going to Morocco for Oussama.




90 Day: The Single Life star Debbie Aguero’s son, Julian B Lin, is a fan-favorite who has viewers taking an interest in wanting to know everything about him. Debbie is a 67-year-old from Sugar Hill, Georgia who is an artist and sells semi-precious jewelry. Debbie was in a relationship with the 24-year-old Oussama Berber from Morocco upon her debut. Oussama and Debbie parted ways when she found out he was with her for a Green Card only. Debbie is currently looking for a new man in the spin-off and, as usual, has Julian by her side with his watchful eye.




Julian was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4. He was introduced as Debbie’s son, who was against her going to Morocco to marry Oussama. Debbie didn’t like that Julian was hateful about it. Debbie and Julian were very close. He popped into her store all the time to visit her and chat about anything and everything. Debbie wanted Julian to give Oussama a chance and not be negative about the situation. Meanwhile, Julian was certain Oussama was catfishing Debbie since Oussama was young, without a job, and lived in a third-world country.

 Julian From 90 Day Fiancé Is A Police Officer 
          




Debbie told the cameras that Julian was a police officer. “He’s a lieutenant,” she said. Debbie had cried that she didn’t want to talk to a cop when she was discussing her future with Oussama. “I wanna talk to my son,” she&#39;d insisted. Julian was “sick to his stomach” when he found out a 23-year-old man from Morocco was engaged to his 67-year-old mom. Julian was certain Oussama was scamming his free-spirited mom. He had “many, many fears as a loving son” about Oussama and felt there was something “sinister” going on about the situation. In the end, police officer Julian’s intuition turned out to be right.



 Julian Also Has Acting Experience 

 

According to IMDB, Julian is also an actor by profession, apart from being a lieutenant and a reality TV star. He played a Swat Officer in the TV series MacGyver in 2019 and an Upsurge Board Member in two episodes of Saints &amp; Sinners in season 2 and season 4. Julian has also been a part of shows such as Dynasty, The Resident, and Lovestruck. His recent appearances were in Deputy and Brockmire in 2020 before Julian accompanied his mom in the world of 90 Day Fiancé and starred in spin-offs such as 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, Pillow Talk, and 90 Day: The Single Life.






 Julian Was Rumored To Be Dating Jen Boecher 
          

90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4 star Jen Boecher revealed that she gave her phone number to Debbie’s son Julian during the Tell All. Julian was seen slamming Oussama during the reunion for taking advantage of his mother, while Jen was contemplating the future of her relationship with Rishi Singh. Cast members asked Jen to move on from Rishi because his family did not accept their 15-year age difference. “I may or may not have given my phone number to somebody that, you know ...&#34; Jen told Gabe Paboga backstage.

Jen confirmed it was Julian and had said, “What’s not to like about him?” She knew he was her age and an “attractive guy” who also had a career, and she could have a conversation with him. Meanwhile, the cameras had caught Debbie asking her son, “Didn&#39;t you think Jen was kind of cute and nice? Do you think she was kind of like batting her eyes at you a little bit?&#34; while Julian replied he thought Jen was “cool” and told Debbie to give Jen his phone number. A new franchise couple might be in the works and 90 Day: The Single Life season 5 might just feature Julian with his own storyline.






90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
