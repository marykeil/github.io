## Literature Review

One Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 player has attempted to recreate one of the most iconic scenes in Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man 2, with an amusing outcome.




One Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 player has attempted to recreate one of the most iconic scenes in Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man movie trilogy, with an amusing result. Insomniac&#39;s open-world depictions of New York and its various suit options for both Peter Parker and Miles Morales&#39; Spider-Men have made it easy for players to explore the world as their favorite depictions of the characters from the past six decades of comics and other media and pull off some of the webheads&#39; most famous feats.




Despite several different depictions of Peter Parker in movies over the years, Tobey Maguire&#39;s portrayal in Sam Raimi&#39;s Spider-Man trilogy is often deemed one of the best. 2002&#39;s Spider-Man was one of the first in the new wave of superhero blockbusters that started with 1998&#39;s R-rated Blade and entered the more mainstream PG-13 space with 2000&#39;s X-Men. These newer superhero films sought to tell more grounded stories with their characters following the collapse of the Batman movies of the late 80s and 90s, which had fallen apart with the release of the much-reviled Batman and Robin. Much like Fox&#39;s X-Men, Raimi&#39;s Spider-Man balanced practical effects with then-revolutionary CGI to bring the character to life in a way that wasn&#39;t possible in live-action before.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.   





 Spider-Man 2&#39;s Train Sequence Has Been Attempted In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
With A Very Different Outcome From The Movie
While seeing Spider-Man face Green Goblin in the first film was impressive enough, the release of Raimi&#39;s 2004 sequel, Spider-Man 2 saw the stakes raised yet again with the arrival of another iconic villain: Doctor Octopus. This saw sequences where the two would fight each other up the sides of buildings, or most memorably, on the side of a speeding train. During the train sequence, Doc Ock removes the vehicle&#39;s brake mechanism, letting it speed toward certain doom with many innocent civilians trapped on board. Having to adapt quickly to the situation, Peter fires several web lines from the front of the train to try to slow it down and, ultimately, he succeeds.



Spider-Man 2&#39;s train sequence was such a technical feat for the time that the production team had to begin getting footage for it before principal photography even began on the rest of the film.




One Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 player, Ronderer, had Peter Parker don Tobey Maguire&#39;s &#34;Webbed Suit&#34; in the game and used the new web line mechanic - which can fire a web from across two points of a room, or between buildings to let Spider-Man walk across them - to attempt a similar feat, pairing it with the slingshot traversal ability. Unfortunately, things didn&#39;t seem to go to plan and the following video shows the disastrous, yet amusing, result.





 

Insomniac&#39;s own take on the Spider-Man story is enjoyable on its own and has received praise from critics and fans. However, it&#39;s a testament to the level of detail and the new gameplay possibilities added to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 that players can attempt to recreate such moments from their favorite Spider-Man media outside of the game&#39;s main campaign. This also extends the longevity of the title while players eagerly await the New Game Plus and Mission Replay options being added later this year. Hopefully, when Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 arrives, Peter&#39;s attempt to stop the train - as he does in the Spider-Man 2 movie - will be more successful.
