## Literature Review

The Electric-type Legendary hound Raikou returns from the Johto region for you to find and catch in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.





Raikou should not be confused with Raging Bolt in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, which is only available in Pokémon Scarlet. The familiar Legendary can be caught in both editions, but you have to finish the main story of the base game to reach the rare Pokémon. You will also need a special item called a Raikou Treat in your inventory to attract this member of the dog trio to Paldea.




                  How To Catch All Legendary Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC   There are 25 wild Legendary Pokémon available for catching in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but each one must be unlocked with an item.   


 Where To Find Raikou 
          

Raikou will only appear in the West Province of Area 1 on your Paldea map when you gain the Raikou Treat from completing Blueberry quests with Snacksworth at Blueberry Academy. The Indigo Disk DLC introduces many missions Snacksworth gives to earn Battle Points (BP) in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Finishing enough of these goals will cause Snacksworth to reward various items.



Fly up toward the Pokémon Center or Watchtower in West Province once you get the Raikou Treat to spot the Legendary on one of the higher mountains in the area.







Keep taking on Blueberry quests and talk to Snacksworth at BBQ events to eventually receive the Raikou Treat. You might also be given the Treats for other Legendaries in this process, including some powerful Pokémon like Latias or Reshiram in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Continuing to complete these quests gives you an excellent opportunity to fill up your Pokédex with the returning creatures in the DLC.



 How To Catch Raikou 
          

Raikou is a Level 70 Pokémon and is only weak to Ground-type attacks while resisting Steel-type and Electric-type moves. Make sure to bring Quick Balls to catch Raikou within the first couple of turns since that type of Pokéball improves capture rates if thrown early. The Legendary Pokémon in Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC has a normal capture rate of 1.6% in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.




Other ways to improve your chances are to use Ultra Balls or Timer Balls as the battle against Raikou grows longer. Your Pokémon should be around the same level as the Legendary before you decide to track it down. This way, your team can survive the many strong attacks Raikou knows, which include some heavy hitters like Discharge that are boosted by its typing.

Applying a status effect like Sleep or Burn could also be an excellent way to improve Raikou&#39;s capture rate, especially since the Electric-type cannot be Paralyzed. If you find and catch Raikou in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, you can take on nearly any trainer with this iconic addition to your team.
