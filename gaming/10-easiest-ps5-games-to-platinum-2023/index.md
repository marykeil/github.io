## Literature Review

Accumulating PlayStation trophies can be a game in itself for players, here are some 2023 releases that give quick Platinums to fill the collection.




For most PlayStation games, getting a platinum trophy is a sign of ultimate completion of that game and can be a very rewarding and exciting accomplishment to see. Many large games may require hundreds of hours with near-impossible challenges to achieve that coveted platinum trophy; however, many smaller titles are not quite as time-consuming or difficult. In 2023, many indie games were released for PlayStation that can give a lot of pleasure for a cheaper price tag, and offer platinum trophies that can be fairly quick to get.
It can be fun to look back at the end of the year to see how many platinum trophies have been collected over the months, and it is great to show off to friends on social media. Additionally, PlayStation&#39;s loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, can occasionally provide collectibles and points for earning trophies as well, which further incentivizes the experience of achieving goals. For anyone looking to add to their overall total of platinums, giving some of these games a try is an easy way to do that.
