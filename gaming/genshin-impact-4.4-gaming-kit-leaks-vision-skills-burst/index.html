  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Details about Gaming in Genshin Impact 4.4 have been leaked, though developer HoYoverse has yet to officially make an announcement.   The new leaks detail Gaming&rsquo;s gameplay kit, including his special abilities, as well as Passive Talents and Constellation levels.   As is the case with any leak, the details should be taken with a grain of salt ahead of the official reveal.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The specifics of Gaming’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact, including his abilities and weapon type, have been mentioned in new Version 4.4 leaks.</p>
<p>The gameplay kit for Gaming in Genshin Impact 4.4 has leaked, revealing more details about his Vision, weapon type, abilities, and even Passive Talents and Constellation levels. Gaming was previously leaked as the “lion boy”, but has since been confirmed and officially announced by developer HoYoverse as Gaming. Considering his name, design, and official description, it is known that Gaming is from the Nation of Liyue and usually operates around the main city, Liyue Harbor.</p>
<p>If the way HoYoverse usually announces its new characters is to be considered, Gaming is being added to the next Version of the game, along with Xianyun in Genshin Impact. So far, only a few details about him have been revealed, and he has not even appeared as an NPC in the game yet. Nevertheless, a sequence of leaks has lined out most of his gameplay kit, going so far as to allow players to better understand what role Gaming will have in a team comp once he is officially released.</p>
<pre><code>              New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.   
</code></pre>
<p>Gaming’s Vision &amp; Weapon Type In Genshin Impact Leaks</p>
<p>As was officially revealed by HoYoverse itself in a post made on the official Genshin Impact account on X, Gaming will have a Pyro Vision. Though his weapon of choice was not confirmed, this information was mentioned in the leak shared by user HomDGCat on Reddit. According to the leaks, Gaming will use a claymore in battle. This is not specified but understood from the description of his other abilities in the leak compilation. So far, HoYoverse has not revealed Gaming’s rarity, but it is rumored he will be a 4-star unit.</p>
<p>As is the case with any leak, the details about Gaming and his gameplay kit should be taken with a grain of salt ahead of the official reveal by HoYoverse. The specifics about him may be inaccurate, outdated, or still subject to change ahead of Version 4.4’s release later in January.</p>
<p>Gaming’s Normal, Charged, &amp; Plunging Attacks In Genshin Impact Leaks</p>
<p>According to the leaks shared on Reddit, Gaming’s Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will not differ from the standard ones that regular 4-star claymore units have. His Normal Attack will allow players to execute up to four consecutive strikes with the character. With his Charged Attack in Genshin Impact 4.4, Gaming will drain stamina to spin around and hit all enemies within the radius of his claymore. Once he stops attacking, either by player prompt or lack of stamina, Gaming unleashes a stronger strike. While he is spinning, Gaming can slowly move around.</p>
<pre><code>              Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   
</code></pre>
<p>With Gaming’s Plunging Attack, the rumored 4-star character will be able to initiate an attack from midair, plunging downwards and hitting anything in his path. Though his regular Plunging Attack will not differ from other characters, this is core to his gameplay rotation. Gaming is expected to be a Plunging DMG DPS character in Genshin Impact, according to leaks about his other abilities.</p>
<p>Because Gaming is a claymore character, his Normal Attacks (which are all called Stellar Rend) deal Physical DMG instead of Pyro DMG. He is, however, able to use Pyro DMG through the usage of his other abilities.</p>
<p>Gaming’s Elemental Skill In Genshin Impact Leaks</p>
<p>As stated in the leaks, Gaming’s Elemental Skill is called Bestial Ascent. Once activated, Gaming will pounce forward by invoking his Wushou arts, and then jump even higher when he comes into contact with a target or surface. After Gaming has risen into the air with his Elemental Skill, he can use the special Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider when activating Plunging Attacks in midair. This special Plunging Attack enabled by the usage of his Elemental Skill in Genshin Impact will convert his Physical DMG into Pyro DMG, an effect that cannot be overridden by other elemental infusions.</p>
<p>The leaks mention that when Gaming lands his Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider attack, a fixed amount of his HP will be consumed. According to the post on Reddit, 15% of his Max HP is the cost for a single instance of this special Plunging Attack. However, Gaming’s HP cannot be reduced below 10% with this method. Plunging Attack DMG is considered when calculating Charmed Cloudstrider DMG. Gaming’s Elemental Skill in Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks has a cooldown of six seconds and a single charge.</p>
<pre><code>              Genshin Impact 4.5 Leaks Reveal New Banner Characters   Even though Version 4.5 is still a ways away from arriving, there are already leaks regarding the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact.   
</code></pre>
<p>Players should be especially careful when considering leaks about abilities’ specifics, such as cooldown times, Energy Cost, charges, and percentages. These are more likely to be adjusted ahead of launch than how the ability itself works.</p>
<p>Gaming’s Elemental Burst In Genshin Impact Leaks</p>
<p>With his leaked Elemental Burst, Gaming enters a state called Wushou Stance, which applies Pyro to himself and helps him restore 30% of his Max HP. This also summons his companion, Man Chai, who will ram the desired target for AoE (area of effect) Pyro DMG. Once Man Chai hits its target, it will move around before returning to Gaming in Genshin Impact. When it does return, Man Chai is removed from the field and resets the cooldown for Gaming’s Elemental Skill. Only one Man Chai can exist on the field per Gaming – if there are two Gamings in multiplayer, for instance, each can summon their own Man Chai.</p>
<p>With Wushou Stance active, when Gaming lands a Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider or completes his forward pounce with his Elemental Skill with over 50% of his Max HP remaining, Man Chai will be summoned again. For reference, the leaks mention that the Elemental Burst’s Wushou Stance lasts for 12 seconds. It seems like Gaming’s Elemental Burst, called Suanni’s Gilded Dance, will be less about dealing damage itself, and more about enabling the new 4-star Pyro unit to use his Elemental Skill repeatedly for maximum damage output. The Burst is said to have a 15-second cooldown and a 60 Energy requirement in Genshin Impact.</p>
<p>Man Chai is represented by a suānní, one of the nine sons of the Dragon King in Chinese mythology. The suānní is a hybrid between a dragon and a lion.</p>
<p>Gaming’s Passive Talents In Genshin Impact Leaks</p>
<p>Gaming’s three Passive Talents have also allegedly leaked before his official release. The first of them is called Dance of Amity and it allows Gaming to regain 1.5% of his Max HP once every 0.2 seconds for 0.8 seconds after hitting an opponent with his Elemental Skill’s Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider. This will be a way of mitigating his HP loss, even if in a minor way. The second leaked Passive Talent for Gaming in Genshin Impact is called Air of Prosperity.</p>
<pre><code>              Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: The Best Region Is Getting Even Bigger   It seems like the best region in Genshin Impact may be getting an extension in Version 4.4. Here is what this could mean for the story.   
</code></pre>
<p>With the ability, when Gaming has less than 50% of his HP, he receives a 20% Incoming Healing Bonus. When he has 50% HP or more, his Elemental Skill’s Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider gets a 20% DMG bonus. Gaming’s third and final Passive Talent in the Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks is called The Striding Beast, and it increases the entire party’s Movement Speed by 10% during the day. This effect does not occur inside Domains, Trounce Domains, or the Spiral Abyss, and does not stack with other Passive Talents that offer the same bonus.</p>
<p>All Of Gaming’s Constellations In Genshin Impact Leaks</p>
<p>In addition to his active and passive abilities, Gaming’s Constellations were also outlined in the leak posted on Reddit. His C1 is called Bringer of Blessing and it makes Man Chai heal 15% of Gaming’s HP when it reconnects with the character after the usage of the Elemental Burst. C2 is called Plum Blossoms Underfoot, and, with it, when Gaming’s incoming healing overflows his Max HP, his ATK is increased by 20% for 5 seconds. C3, named Awakening Spirit, will boost his Elemental Skill in Genshin Impact by three levels and increase the upgrade cap to 15.</p>
<p>Gaming’s C4 is called Soar Across Mountains. When his Elemental Skill’s Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider hits an enemy, it will restore 2 Energy to Gaming, an effect that can be triggered every 0.2 seconds. Demon-Daunting Roar is his C5, and it boosts his Burst by three levels, increasing the upgrade cap to 15. C6, To Tame All Beasts, makes the CRIT Rate on his Elemental Skill’s Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider increase by 20%, while its CRIT DMG is boosted by 40%. In addition to that, the attack radius of that specific attack in Genshin Impact will be increased.</p>
<pre><code>              Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream - Date, Time, &amp; What To Expect   The special livestream program for Genshin Impact's Version 4.4 should be occurring soon, as the game progresses further into Version 4.3.   
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the leaks so far, it seems like Gaming will be a 4-star Pyro DPS unit, focused on dealing damage through Plunging Attacks. He will lose HP through this, but it seems like he will have his own ways of mitigating that loss. Of course, having a healer may be helpful, especially if he ends up being a good pair to the Marechaussee Hunter Artifact set, which rewards HP fluctuation. Players should wait for HoYoverse’s official confirmation on Gaming’s abilities in Genshin Impact, but he is shaping up to be a unique 4-star character.</p>
