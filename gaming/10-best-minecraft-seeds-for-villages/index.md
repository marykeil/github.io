## Literature Review

Minecraft players can use seeds to create worlds with unique villages, which offer trade and shelter for anyone preparing for future adventures.





The vast landscapes of your sandbox world can be determined from a pre-set seed, a random string of numbers that can create a world another player has already discovered. Those looking for a specific biome, like the best seeds for Islands in Minecraft, could use a known seed to guarantee a world with that exact scenery. Many seeds can only be used on the Bedrock or Java version of the game.
For many more excellent Village seeds beyond what is on this list, feel free to check out a video from YouTube creator Minecraft &amp; Chill that includes a variety of unique worlds you could generate.  



            
 
 10 Best Seeds For Minecraft 1.20 Bedrock Edition 
The Bedrock Edition of Minecraft&#39;s 1.20 update has plenty of gorgeous world seeds that could give you one of your best open-world sandbox experiences.












 








 10  The Coastal Village (Bedrock) 
A Beachfront Home
        

   Seed    Coordinates     -6976859396698713500    (-318, 81, 168)    
This seed creates a beautiful beachfront village close to an ocean, making it an excellent base for those looking to gain a foothold in Survival Mode. Some of the best crops in Minecraft can be found in this settlement, with farmers tending to premade fields of wheat and other important foods. It would be hard to go hungry in this Village, especially considering how much fish you can catch along the shore.
Many homes here act as great starting designs for your own house, which may work best near the docks where you can moor one or two boats. Near this Village are several interesting structures, including an incomplete Nether Portal that you could finish. Large mountains in the distance lead to cave systems for even more resources than you could obtain from the Village buildings in Minecraft. 





 9  The Lagoon Village (Bedrock) 
Isolated and Protected
        

   Seed    Coordinates     -2367667723377945166    (565, 67, -927)    
A large lagoon hosts several Villages within this world seed, full of the best Villagers to trade with in Minecraft as you gain valuable materials for your adventure. From Clerics to Librarians to even Blacksmiths, this community is unique for having many vendors in a minuscule space. The size of this Village makes it difficult to reach, but it is a perfect place to avoid hostile mobs like Creepers or Skeletons. 
This seed has a small piece of land just behind the lagoon Village that could be a perfect vantage point for a base after you finish trading with many of the local Villagers. 






 8  The Plains Village (Bedrock) 
A Classic Community
        

   Seed    Coordinates     6285574721787818473    (238, 65, 89)    
A pristine river courses alongside a hilltop Village found in a Plains biome within this seed, giving you a classic place to build a home. Those familiar with older versions of Minecraft will spot nostalgic locations like Forest, Hill, and Mountain biomes all scattered nearby, just begging to be explored. The extra space provided by the spacious grasslands makes it easy to start ambitious crafting projects. 





 7  The Cherry Blossom Villages (Bedrock) 
Pink Forests of 1.20


 







   Seed    Coordinates     9064150133272194    (8, 77, 127)    
First found by Reddit user u/Fragrant_Result_186, this seed hosts two Villages surrounded by the new Cherry Blossom biome found in Minecraft&#39;s 1.20 update. A small lake separates these two settlements in the same valley, but both are easily combined with a small bridge. Librarian and Blacksmith Villagers pair with humble Fishermen to trade with as you take in the lovely view of the waterfalls and grasslands here.


Those looking to create their own Adventure Map will have difficulty picking a better spot than this Village since the oasis is an excellent starting point for new adventurers. The new Bee mobs present in the Cherry Blossoms also help introduce new items from the 1.20 update, letting you create unique Block types and items in Minecraft. 





 6  The Woodland Mansion Village (Bedrock) 
Explore the Mysterious Manor
        

   Seed    Coordinates     -6709148406763899126    (138, 157, 54)    
Seeds that contain rare structures are incredibly popular in Minecraft, with this specific world generating a vast, dungeon-like building called a Woodland Mansion. This seed, discovered by Reddit user u/KamiKazeFritz places you in a village surrounded by snowy mountains, right next to the Mansion itself. Most of the time, these structures are located extremely far away in dense biomes, so this is a lucky find.


Inside the Mansion, you will have to fight through dozens of hostile mobs as you collect a ridiculous amount of loot from various chests hidden in the building. Adventure Mode maps could thrive from this seed, with the Woodland Mansion as the perfect setting for a spooky or mysterious world. Use the resources from the main Village to prepare for expeditions into the Mansion during your Minecraft journey. 





 5  The Savannah Village (Java) 
Unruly But Resilient
        

   Seed    Coordinates     6032206099749663371    (344, 96, -764)    
A slightly chaotic seed, this world creates a Village that once again sits close to the ocean, but this time with a less organized community that is very different from a traditional settlement. You can bring some order to this place, uniting buildings and creating your own structures to make this town &#34;complete.&#34; There are three Shipwrecks just off the coastline with materials to help you start this ongoing endeavor in Minecraft. 
This seed also contains a small Ravine biome on the island where the Village is, giving you a good source of raw materials like Iron Ore or Coal. 






 4  The Floating Village (Java) 
A True Waterworld
        

   Seed    Coordinates     44954149752793085    (47, 84, 27)    
Seeds containing Island Villages are nothing new, but a world where a civilization makes up an entire landmass is one in a million. First discovered by Reddit user u/Beefy_Nad, this peaceful hamlet sits in the middle of the ocean, making it the ideal place to defend yourself from hostile mobs in Minecraft. A nearby Ocean Monument structure and shipwreck will provide plenty of treasure as you settle.


You could also create new Villager types in Minecraft here to make up for the lack of different trade types in this area. This process involves identifying which kind of Villagers can take on a new profession and then determining their role. Some of the best items in the game are tied to Villager trading, so be careful about which jobs you assign to the locals in this seed. 





 3  The Lake Villages (Java) 
Twin Settlements Connected
        

   Seed    Coordinates     712262452098460    (-1063, 99, 1034)    
Discovered by Reddit user u/IPNinja, this Village seed has a town right next to a deep lake with another community nestled on a small isle in the middle of the water. Farmers, Clerics, Blacksmiths, and Masons all live in these respective places, offering their wares to ambitious travelers. The potential to create a small city by combining both Villages will scratch those with an itch for urban planning in this Minecraft world. 







 2  The Mangrove Swamp Village (Java) 
Marshes and Sands


 







   Seed    Coordinates     18692533    (48, 95, 57)    
This seed, found by Reddit user u/archeradicator, puts a Village on a small Island with a Desert and Mangrove Swamp biome, the second of which is a rare location to see in a Minecraft world. The towering sandstone structures of the Desert Village are different from most communities, giving you a sense of height that other Villages rarely offer.


The Mangrove Swamp is small but incredibly interesting, giving you unique block types to use for construction. Mangrove Propagules are rare items that you can only find in this specific type of biome in Minecraft. The warm reefs along the ocean are also teeming with tropical fish and other aquatic mobs to catch and cook for food. 





 1  The Plains Village (Java) 
Pristine Valley of Adventure
        

   Seed    Coordinates     5220491444570808970    (-294, 86, -107)    
Sometimes, the perfect Village seed has a bit of everything this world offers, with a settlement in the middle of a large valley. Tucked into a peninsula, this Village is located near several adventuring opportunities, which include a Pillager Outpost and an incomplete Nether Portal. The supplies you take from the town will be more than enough to face the challenges of both of these structures in Minecraft.
Another Village exists immediately west of the one mentioned in this seed&#39;s coordinates, giving you two large communities to explore. The vast number of resources you can collect in either location will serve anyone looking to have a fun adventure in Survival Mode. There are many places to call home in Minecraft, but the best seeds for Villages create these places in spades if you are willing to seek them out.
