## Literature Review

Rumors about GTA 6 have run rampant for nearly a decade. With its first trailer fast approaching, hereâ€™s what it needs to confirm or deny.




Rumors have raged around Grand Theft Auto 6 for nearly a decade, but the wait is almost over. GTA 6 news is coming soon, with the first trailer as little as a month away at the time of writing. But anticipatory players have obsessed over every possible aspect of this game since almost immediately after GTA 5 came out in 2013, despite knowing next to nothing about it. This first trailer has many eyes on it, and a lot of expectations to deal with already.
The very first trailer for GTA 6 will probably confirm a lot of things that players have long since accepted as truth. At the same time, it&#39;ll probably put down a lot of the wild rumors circulating about GTA 6. Here are a few good things for the first GTA 6 trailer to confirm or deny, and one thing it shouldn&#39;t even deign to touch.
            
 
 Every Hint And Clue Rockstar Has Given About GTA 6 (So Far) 
With all the hype built around Grand Theft Auto 6, it makes sense that people are latching onto even the slightest clues from Rockstar Games. 













 








 11  Location 
Is GTA 6 Set In Vice City?


 







The first trailer should make a definitive statement about where GTA 6 is set. Of course, the long-standing rumor holds that GTA 6 might be set in Vice City, but there&#39;s been no official information to confirm that. This will probably be one of the first questions the GTA 6 trailer sets out to answer: a couple of establishing shots depicting the city where it&#39;s set should be enough to provide an answer.





 10  Map Size 
What New Areas Will GTA 6 Include?
        

Some of the most unbelievable rumors about GTA 6 have involved the potential size of its map. In particular, some have claimed that GTA 6 would include a scale replica of the entire United States, but by now, most have given up on that dream. GTA 6 map leaks are partially responsible for rumors of a Vice City setting, so assuming those are real, how much larger will GTA 6&#39;s map be? Will it include new locations inspired by the Miami area, expanding north into Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale or west into Hialeah and the Everglades? Will it visit other nearby landmasses, like the Florida Keys, Cuba, or the Bahamas?





 9  Protagonist 
Is Lucia The Protagonist Of GTA 6?
        

Other rumors suggest GTA 6 has the series&#39; first female protagonist. Leaks of in-development gameplay suggest her name is Lucia, and she may be one of two playable characters in the game. Whatever the case, the first GTA 6 trailer will probably reveal who its protagonist (or protagonists) are one way or another. Whether they&#39;re singular or dual, man or woman, Lucia, Tommy Vercetti from the original Vice City, or someone else entirely - that all remains to be seen.





 8  Platforms 
Will GTA 6 Be Cross-Gen?
        

It&#39;s possible to play GTA 5 on almost any platform under the sun. Will the same be true of GTA 6? Even in 2023, many games still get cross-generational releases, coming out for PS4 and Xbox One along with PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It&#39;s impossible to know whether that&#39;ll still be a common strategy by the time GTA 6 comes out, whenever that happens to be. Also, GTA 5 was released for consoles almost a full two years before it came out on PC. GTA 6&#39;s first trailer should reveal what platforms it&#39;ll be on, and whether a PC version will be live at the initial launch.





 7  Setting 
When Is GTA 6 Set?


 







There&#39;s something to be said for the 1980s setting of the original Vice City. The neon lights, boxy old cars, New Wave on the radio - there&#39;s a reason Vice City remains one of the most aesthetically iconic games in the series. For better or worse, GTA 6 could reuse the 80s setting, or bring Vice City into the present day. It could even incorporate multiple timelines, perhaps with players controlling Tommy Vercetti or another Vice City character in the late 80s, and Lucia or another protagonist in the modern day. Whatever the case, this should be immediately clear from the kinds of cars and technology shown in the trailer.





 6  New Vehicles 
What New Planes, Trains, And Automobiles Will GTA 6 Have?


 







The cornerstone of any Grand Theft Auto game is its vehicles - after all, it&#39;s right there in the title. The first GTA 6 trailer should provide a showcase of the vehicles available in the game, ranging from cars to bikes to boats to planes. This has always been a huge selling point of the GTA series. Would-be car collectors love stocking their garages and customizing their rides, while others simply enjoy scenic helicopter flights over the city. An all-inclusive GTA 6 trailer would take all of that into account, but this early in development, it might just be limited to one or two vehicular highlights.





 5  New Weapons 
How Much Carnage Can Players Cause In GTA 6?
        

But give a GTA player a car, and they&#39;ll immediately go looking for a weapon to fire out the window. Apart from driving, combat has always been the other main mechanic in GTA. So the first trailer should try and give players a peek at that, and the best way to do so would be to reveal a handful of weapons that&#39;ll appear in the game. Showcasing the variety of weapon categories, from handguns to rocket launchers, would be a great way to advertise the game. And it couldn&#39;t hurt to throw a few fun ones in there, like GTA 5&#39;s fireworks launcher or GTA Online&#39;s ray gun.





 4  Story Details 
What Will GTA 6&#39;s Plot Be About?
        

The final tenet of classic GTA is the story. The first trailer for GTA 6 could reveal a little bit about its plot, giving players some idea of what to expect. A full synopsis might be too much to ask at this point, but it&#39;d be nice to find out the main thrust of the story, at the very least. Rumors suggest a sort of Bonnie and Clyde story, a string of romantic robberies gone wrong, which seems perfectly on par for the GTA series. Either way, the trailer should provide a couple of hints, maybe in a narrative voice over that explains the overall arc of the plot.





 3  Live Service Or Single-Player 
Will GTA 6 Be Online Only?
        

In its later years, GTA 5 has trended more towards the live service game model, leaving its single-player campaign largely ignored. New content is constantly coming out for GTA Online, while the base game has never even got a true DLC. Some rumors have even claimed that GTA 6 could be online-only, which would alienate a whole subset of players and potentially make its microtransaction problem worse. The question on everyone&#39;s lips is: will GTA 6 continue the trend by focusing on online gameplay, or deliver a quality single-player experience first?





 2  GTA 6 Online 
What Transfers To GTA 6 From GTA Online?
        

But at the same time, current GTA Online players have invested a lot of time into the game. GTA 6&#39;s first trailer may shed a little light on what&#39;s going on with GTA Online. There are basically three avenues it can take. Certain compatible things may simply be transferred. GTA 6&#39;s map could be tacked onto GTA 5&#39;s to create an expanded online mode that retains all current progress. Or, GTA 6&#39;s multiplayer mode could be a completely fresh start. Whatever the case, the first trailer could map out a plan for GTA Online. And there&#39;s still the question of whether it&#39;ll be available at GTA 6&#39;s launch.





 1  GTA 6&#39;s First Trailer Shouldn&#39;t Reveal A Release Date 
It&#39;s Too Early To Expect A Release Date For GTA 6
        

But the one thing the GTA 6 trailer shouldn&#39;t touch is probably what players want most: it shouldn&#39;t reveal GTA 6&#39;s release date. It&#39;s far too early in development to expect such a thing, and it could prove disastrous if there&#39;s eventually a delay. Announcing a release date so early puts an expiration date on the hype; if the game is late for any reason, that means player disappointment, negative public opinion, and canceled pre-orders. Still, a wider window might give Rockstar time to spare while still satisfying fan curiosity. A projected year might be nice.
At this point, no one even knows what the first trailer will look like. It could be as simple as a 30-second teaser that reveals next to nothing, or a five-minute slice of everything the game is. Either way, there should be plenty of new reveals and new opportunities to speculate further when GTA 6&#39;s first trailer is released in December.
