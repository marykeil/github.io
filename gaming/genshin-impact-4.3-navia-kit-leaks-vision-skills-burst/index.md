## Literature Review

Most of Navia’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact has allegedly leaked. Here are all the details about her Skill, Burst, and even Constellation levels.




A detailed look into Navia’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact has leaked, revealing information about her Vision, weapon type, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst. Navia is a 5-star character that players initially meet as an NPC during the Archon Quests set in the Fontaine region. Working alongside her, the Traveler and Paimon were able to better understand the perils of the Nation of Justice, as well as see Navia’s own involvement with the Spina di Rosula, a welfare institution in Fontaine that she inherited from her late father. Now, Navia is set to become a playable character in Genshin Impact 4.3.




She had already been leaked as one of the debuts for the upcoming patch but has since been confirmed by HoYoverse. Navia will not be the only new playable character in Version 4.3, as the developer has also revealed a new 4-star character named Chevreuse in Genshin Impact. This character’s design had already leaked, even before the introduction of Fontaine itself, and they are finally making their way into the action RPG. In addition to the confirmation of the playable characters, now there is information about Navia&#39;s gameplay kit, which highlights most of her active abilities on the field – and further suggests she will be a main DPS.

                  Genshin Impact 4.2: How To Get Freminet For Free   During Version 4.2, you will be able to obtain a free copy of Freminet in Genshin Impact. Here’s how to unlock the free 4-star Cryo character.   


 Navia’s Vision &amp; Weapon Type In Genshin Impact 
          




As had originally been shown and now officially confirmed by HoYoverse in a post on the official Genshin Impact account on X, Navia has a Geo Vision. This was seen in-game, as the Vision is dangling on a ribbon attached to her left arm. Confirming previous rumors about the character, new leaks shared by CrypticalDice on YouTube suggest that Navia is a claymore user. Her signature weapon seems to be an axe-shaped claymore, though this would not impede her from using regular sword-like claymores. While not relevant to the RPG-building aspect of the game itself, Navia also uses her umbrella as a secondary weapon in her animation set.



 Navia’s Normal &amp; Charged Attacks In Genshin Impact 
         

According to the leaks so far, there is nothing particularly special about Navia’s Normal or Charged Attacks. Contrary to Furina in Genshin Impact, for instance, using them does not trigger a secondary state in the Arkhe system. Navia’s Normal Attacks can be used sequentially up to four times, as she strikes opponents with her claymore. Navia’s Charged Attack has her spinning around while consuming Stamina to continuously deal damage – this is the standard Charged Attack for various claymore users. Because she is not a catalyst user, which enables elemental DMG with normal strikes, Navia’s regular attacks deal Physical DMG rather than Geo DMG.




Although they are quite standard when it comes to gameplay value, the animation sets on Navia’s Normal and Charged Attacks are worth noticing, according to Navia’s leaks in Genshin Impact. Her sequence of Normal Attacks sees Navia unleash two strikes and, on the third attack, she kicks her claymore against enemies. She wraps up the sequence with a fourth strike, marked by the usage of her umbrella as a melee weapon. While the majority of Navia’s Charged Attack animation is regular, it is marked by the fact that she equips sunglasses and ends in a flourish, removing them in style. Of course, as a leak, this is subject to change.



Navia’s gameplay kit is aligned to Ousia, as suggested by the format of the casing that holds her Vision.






 Navia’s Elemental Skill In Genshin Impact 
          




As seen in her leaked animation kit and further backed up by a descriptive leak shared by Sportskeeda, Navia’s Elemental Skill has two distinct forms in Genshin Impact. The first is the Press form, which will see the user quickly tap the button that activates her Elemental Skill. When doing so, Navia consumes stacks of Fissure Crystal Shards to fire various Rose Crystal Bullets. These ammunitions deal damage to opponents. By consuming 0/1/2/3 Fissure Crystal Shards, Navia shoots 5/7/9/11 Rose Crystal Bullets, respectively. These stackable shards for her Elemental Skill can be picked up from regular crystallization reactions that occur on the field, according to the leaks.

The Hold version of Navia’s Elemental Skill is a bit different. By pressing and holding the button that activates this ability, Navia enters an aim mode. This special mode works similarly to that of the Press form, though it allows players to more carefully and precisely aim at opponents rather than leaving it up to chance. In the Hold form of her Elemental Skill in Genshin Impact, Navia will still consume stacks of Fissure Crystal Shard to shoot more Rose Crystal Bullets. The leaks suggest that up to six stacks can be held at the same time – though the base limit for her Skill is three.




These Fissure Crystal Shard stacks can last up to 300 seconds, with each newly collected stack refreshing the countdown. As suggested by the leaked video footage, the Rose Crystal Bullets that Navia shoots out via her Elemental Skill are infused with Geo, meaning they may be able to trigger additional crystallize reactions, thus retrofeeding the ability itself. As each stack grants more projectiles, and each projectile causes more damage, it seems like obtaining stacks of Fissure Crystal Shard will be a vital part of her gameplay loop as a main DPS in Genshin Impact – simply because boosting the damage output is crucial to the role.



 Navia’s Elemental Burst In Genshin Impact 
          

Even if somewhat simple, the character’s Elemental Skill has some complexity. In direct opposition, the Navia’s Elemental Burst is very straightforward. By activating her ultimate ability, Navia invokes a barrage of cannonballs to strike the field. The Elemental Burst starts off with an initial explosion, dealing a large sum of damage, followed by some seconds of continuous fire on the field – the leaks reported by Sportskeeda indicate that, at Talent level 10, her Burst’s barrage continues to strike the field for a total of 12 seconds. Every portion of Navia’s Elemental Burst deals AoE (area of effect) Geo DMG in Genshin Impact.






 Navia’s Passive Talents In Genshin Impact 
          

So far, only two of Navia’s Passive Talents have leaked, as opposed to the regular three that each character has. The first one detailed by Sportskeeda indicates that using her Elemental Skill will increase the damage dealt by 40% for four seconds, as other types of damage are converted to &#34;unenchantable&#34; Geo DMG. Navia’s second passive Talent in Genshin Impact sees her ATK stat increased by 20% for each party member whose element is Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo. She can increase her ATK by up to 40% with this method.



 Navia’s Constellations In Genshin Impact 
          




Navia’s Constellations in Genshin Impact have also allegedly leaked, giving further insight into what benefits players can get when they obtain multiple copies of the character. According to a Redditor credited in Sportskeeda’s reports, C1 grants Navia 2 Energy when she uses her Elemental Skill, and reduces the cooldown of her Burst by 1 second, up to a maximum of 6 Energy regenerated, and 3 seconds reduced. With C2, whenever Navia uses her Skill, she increases the CRIT Rate of that instance of her Skill by 8% for every Fissure Crystal Shard consumed, up to 24%.

Navia’s C2 also sees that, when the Skill hits an enemy, a single instance of Supportive Barrage from her Burst strikes the area – only one of these can be triggered per Skill usage. C3 boosts Navia’s Skill by three levels and increases the cap to 15. C4 reduces the enemy’s Geo Resistance by 20% for 8 seconds when the Skill hits in Genshin Impact. C5 boosts her Burst by three levels and increases the cap to 15. Lastly, C6 sees that, if three shards are consumed when using her Skill, each extra shard increases the Skill’s CRIT DMG by 35% and any shards consumed beyond the third are refunded.




Like most of the leaks in the game, however, everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Some pieces of information may simply be inaccurate, while others are still subject to change ahead of the character’s official release. Navia will arrive with Genshin Impact 4.3, so players can expect to see her becoming a playable character on December 20, if she is introduced with Phase 1 banners.
