## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Night City is the home to many gangs, each with their own rich history. The youngest of which has its origins steeped in tragedy.




Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Night City is the home to many gangs, each with its own rich history and lore. While gangs such as Maelstrom were formed out of the remains of a former gang, the Metal Warriors, and the Tyger Claws employed methods of Asian crime syndicates such as the Yakuza or the Triads, one of the coolest gangs in the city, the Mox, has an origin steeped in tragedy.






Trigger Warning: The following story contains references to sexual assault and suicide.




The Mox didn&#39;t appear in any of the Cyberpunk tabletop games and made its debut in Cyberpunk 2077 as one of the youngest established in Night City, being formed only ten years prior to the events of CD Projekt Red&#39;s game. Unlike the other gangs who have claimed huge territories in Night City, The Mox mostly keep to themselves and work around Lizzie&#39;s Bar, which also serves as the gang&#39;s headquarters, protecting their own.

                  Every Gang In Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Night City, Explained   Keeping track of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s many gangs can get overwhelming. Here&#39;s how to tell each one apart - and how they came to stand in Night City.   


 The Death Of Lizzie Borden Created The Mox 
Borden&#39;s Death Led To Riots Across Night City
          




The Mox was formed due to the death of Elizabeth &#34;Lizzie&#34; Borden, a former prostitute and well-known strip club owner in Kabuki, Watson. Borden was considered to be fair with her treatment of her Joytoy workers and would defend them from violent clients, even if it meant losing their business in the process, which made her a popular figure in the community.

When one of Lizzie&#39;s Joytoys was brutally raped and murdered by Tyger Claw members in her club, Lizzie avenged her by killing three of the assailants with an axe. She then went on to display their bodies in front of her club, proclaiming that the same would happen to anyone else who hurt a sex worker.



The character Lizzie Borden was named after a woman tried and acquitted for axe murders in 1892.




Unfortunately, the Tyger Claws returned later that night, destroyed Lizzie&#39;s business, and murdered her in retaliation. Lizzie&#39;s death led to massive riots throughout Night City, with many of its protesters targeting the Tyger Claws&#39; members and businesses. The Mox was formed in the process by bringing together those who felt threatened and oppressed, especially among sex workers and sexual minorities.

 How The Mox Honored Lizzie Borden 
Lizzie Borden Became A Symbol Of Defiance
          

Following the riots, The Mox then took up the role of the protector of Night City’s sex workers, using Lizzie&#39;s principles as their own. Several of Borden&#39;s former workers and supporters rebuilt the strip club alongside the newly-formed gang to serve as The Mox&#39;s headquarters. The club was then named &#34;Lizzie’s Bar&#34; to honor its former owner.



Lizzie&#39;s Bar has a neon light in the shape of a woman holding an axe at its entrance, referencing the weapon Borden used to kill the Tiger Claws.







The Mox&#39;s name derives from the old slang term &#34;moxie&#34; due to the gang&#39;s determination and perseverance when standing up against their oppressors, as Borden once did. The Roman numeral for &#34;five&#34; and the number &#34;13&#34; are displayed below the Mox logo tattooed on most of the gang&#39;s members, and portray the death anniversary of Elizabeth Borden and the official birth of The Mox: May 13. &#34;V.13&#34; often appears on items from The Mox&#39;s clothing brand &#34;BITCH&#34;.



The Mox was originally known as &#34;The Lizzies&#34; in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s earlier promotional material, sharing a name with the all-female gang from The Warriors. This led to some believing the gang was one that was obsessed with the singer Lizzy Wizzy, rather than a gang honoring Lizzie Borden.






 How The Mox Has Changed Over The Years 
The Mox Has Become More Profit-Driven
         




While many members continue their sex work at the club and other brothels around the city and may have a &#34;plastic doll&#34; style reminiscent of Joytoys and Dolls for the pleasure of clients, these are often disguises for the RealSkinn cyberware to hide their combat-ready implants. While the gang does wear outfits that are a mix of the punk aesthetic and the inexpensive fashion worn typically by prostitutes, their attire is designed to never restrict their movements, making them always ready for a fight, even if they don&#39;t initially seek out violence.

While The Mox doesn&#39;t have a coherent hierarchy, they do have a definite leader, Susanna Quinn (aka. Susie Q). Since taking charge of The Mox, Susie Q began to treat the gang as more of a business, and by the events of Cyberpunk 2077, The Mox began demanding fees for their protection services. This has caused some conflict within the gang as some believe it goes against Borden&#39;s original principles and that protection should be free. However, Susie Q believes it is the best way to keep the gang and their business afloat and will still welcome those who seek refuge.




This is evident in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s story when The Mox refuses to get involved with V and Judy Alvarez and her plans for the premium club, Clouds. Following the constant sexual abuse of Evelyn Parker, which led to her suicide, Judy seeks to free the Joytoys and Dolls there by helping them take control of Clouds and claim independence. The Mox&#39;s reluctance to get involved shows that while its principles may have started strong, being borne of tragedy, unfortunately, it seems like the gang has become more profit-driven over time, leaving some of its original ideology behind.
