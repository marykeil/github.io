## Literature Review

Chevreuse’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact has allegedly leaked. Here are all the details about her Elemental Skill, Burst, and even Constellations.




Chevreuse’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact has allegedly leaked, offering more information about how this character operates on the field. The leaks contain details about her regular attacks, her Elemental Skill and Burst, her Passive Talents, and even her Constellations. Chevreuse is a new 4-star character from the region of Fontaine. While she has not yet made her debut with the release of Genshin Impact 4.2, she was confirmed by HoYoverse as an upcoming hero.




In fact, Chevreuse will become a playable character in Genshin Impact 4.3, along with the release of Navia. Unlike Navia, who is a 5-star hero, Chevreuse will be a 4-star character. Other than her design, which was included in the various leaks ahead of the release of Version 4.0 and the introduction of Fontaine, very little was actually known about Chevreuse. However, that has changed, as most of her gameplay kit allegedly leaked before Version 4.3.

                  Genshin Impact 4.2: How To Get Freminet For Free   During Version 4.2, you will be able to obtain a free copy of Freminet in Genshin Impact. Here’s how to unlock the free 4-star Cryo character.   


 Chevreuse’s Vision &amp; Weapon Type In Genshin Impact 
          

According to a post made on the official Genshin Impact account on X, Chevreuse has a Pyro Vision, meaning she wields fire as her main element in battle. She is seen holding a rifle, though there are no suggestions of her weapon type from official sources. Nevertheless, leaked gameplay footage shows Chevreuse in action and, according to the video, she is a polearm user in Genshin Impact. Of course, this information has yet to be confirmed, but it does not seem like it is going to change anytime soon if it is, in fact, true, as altering the entire animation set in a few weeks is an unreasonable feat.






 Chevreuse’s Normal &amp; Charged Attacks In Genshin Impact 
          

As shown through the leaked footage, shared in a video by CrypticDice on YouTube, Chevreuse is a standard polearm user and, as such, does not have any different types of mechanics attributed to her Normal or Charged Attacks in Genshin Impact. With her Normal Attacks, Chevreuse is capable of pulling together a string of four attacks. The first two strike directly in front of her, while the third sees her spinning her polearm around her. The fourth and final attack is a jab forward with the polearm. She finishes the sequence with an animation that has her adjusting and spinning her spear in a military style.

This matches her entire visual aesthetic of an elite guard. Chevreuse’s Charged Attack, on the other hand, is similar to those of other standard polearm users. Using this attack will send Chevreuse spiraling forward. This is the same animation used by characters like Xiangling, for instance, who is, coincidentally, also a 4-star Pyro polearm user. It is important to note that these are regular attacks, as recent releases have changed how some characters’ Normal and Charged Attacks work. Furina in Genshin Impact, for instance, changes her Arkhe alignment when using a Charged Attack, while Lyney’s Charged Attacks consume his HP to create Grim-Malkin Hat props that deal damage to opponents.






Chevreuse’s alignment in the Arkhe system is set to Ousia, as noted by the shape of the casing of her Vision in the leaked gameplay footage.






 Chevreuse’s Elemental Skill In Genshin Impact 
         

While her equipped polearm will dictate part of the damage output, working alongside stats granted by Talents and Artifacts, Chevreuse’s Elemental Skill in Genshin Impact actually features a secondary weapon: her rifle. Her Skill has two forms in the game. The first is the Press form. This is activated by tapping the button that activates her Elemental Skill, but how this form works has not yet been detailed, as pointed out in the leaks shared by Sportskeeda. The Hold form of her Elemental Skill has Chevreuse enter an aiming mode with her rifle and then locking her sights on enemies within the UI frame.




When fired, the projectile deals Pyro DMG against the target. In addition to that, Chevreuse may fire an Overloaded Bullet, which grants a larger AoE (area of effect) and deals more damage. The Genshin Impact leaks say that she can allegedly obtain this Overloaded Bullet when a party member triggers an Overloaded reaction on the field – which may make an Electro unit indispensable for Chevreuse’s team comp. By shooting with her Skill, Chevreuse also activates healing for the active character based on her Max HP. This effect lasts 12 seconds and has a cooldown of 15 seconds, which may just be the cooldown of the ability itself.



The Press form of Chevreuse’s Skill may be a simpler, less damaging, and maybe even less precise version of the Hold form.






 Chevreuse’s Elemental Burst In Genshin Impact 
          




As seen in the leaked video footage and backed up by the information shared by Sportskeeda, Chevreuse’s Elemental Burst in Genshin Impact is quick and explosive. By triggering it, Chevreuse charges a projectile with her rifle and shoots forth a barrage of grenades in an area, which explodes shortly after. This is very similar to Klee’s Elemental Skill, though it is the Burst of a 4-star character instead. This attack is expected to deal AoE Pyro DMG. According to the leaks about Chevreuse, the Energy requirement for it is 60, and the cooldown time is 15 seconds.



 Chevreuse’s Passive Talents In Genshin Impact 
          

Similar to the Navia kit leaks in Genshin Impact, only two of Chevreuse’s Passive Talents have been leaked so far. The first one, as stated by Sportskeeda, revolves around team comps. If the party is completely composed of Pyro and Electro units, with at least one character of each element, Chevreuse will trigger the Synergized Tactics buff on the team. This effect means that whenever the party triggers an Overloaded Elemental Reaction, the enemy’s Pyro and Electro Resistances will be decreased for six seconds. This aligns with the allegations that Chevreuse needs Overloaded reactions, as she also gains the Overloaded Bullet for her Skill.




The second leaked Passive Talent in Chevreuse’s kit boosts her Max HP when she uses her Elemental Skill. This Talent also boosts the ATK of Pyro and Electro units in the party by 1% for every 1,000 HP of her Max HP, up to a 40% ATK boost. Along with her healing potential, this does seem to establish Chevreuse as a support character in Genshin Impact, as she will drop in to activate healing and Trigger Pyro-based reactions, and leave, but still be able to boost her allies’ offensive potential.



 Chevreuse’s Constellations In Genshin Impact 
          

Chevreuse’s Constellations have also leaked. C1 grants all party members, except Chevreuse, 6 Energy when they trigger an Overloaded Elemental Reaction while under the influence of the Synergized Tactics buff. C2 allows Chevreuse to fire two extra shots from her Elemental Skill’s Hold form, which deals 120% of her ATK as Pyro DMG. C3 increases her Skill’s level by 3 and boosts the cap up to 15. The fourth level of Chevreuse’s Constellations in Genshin Impact (C4) sees that, when she uses her Elemental Burst, her Skill’s cooldown will be reduced. C5 boosts the Burst’s Talent level by 3 and increases the cap to 15.




The sixth and final Constellation (C6) allows Chevreuse to heal the entire team with her Skill, as opposed to limiting the effect on the active character. C6 also buffs healed characters’ Pyro and Electro DMG by 20%, an effect that can be stacked up to three times. The leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, as they can be incorrect or subject to change. Nevertheless, the leaked information about Chevreuse in Genshin Impact points toward a solid support unit, even if it is limiting in terms of team comps due to its reliance on Pyro and Electro units exclusively.
