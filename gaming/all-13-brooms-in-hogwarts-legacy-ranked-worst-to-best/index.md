## Literature Review

Broomsticks are the fastest way to get around the map, but they can also be the most stylish if players get the best brooms in Hogwarts Legacy.




Witches and wizards have long been known to get around on broomsticks, but that doesn&#39;t mean people can&#39;t take to the skies in style with Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s best brooms. Naturally, these magical household items all share the same general shape and structure, but with unique decor and detailing, some stand out as better-looking than others. Everyone, regardless of their taste, can find the perfect accessory with which to take flight in the Harry Potter prequel - especially if they keep their eyes peeled for the best brooms in Hogwarts Legacy.
There are many brooms that can be purchased in the game, with prices that vary drastically from free up to 6,000 galleons, and others that come as rewards for completing quests and challenges. No matter how expensive or difficult to come by, they each come with the same base level of performance. Thus, with flight speed and other qualities out of the question, the decision purely comes down to personal preferences and style. But if players want to be the coolest on the Quidditch pitch, owning one (or more) of the best brooms in Hogwarts Legacy will certainly help them achieve that goal.
            
 
 Hogwarts Legacy: Every House Exclusive Quest, Ranked 
In Hogwarts Legacy, which house a player gets sorted into matters for more than just cosmetics, there are also unique quests available for each. 












 








 13  Yew Weaver 
Purchased From Spintwitches Sporting Needs In Hogsmeade


 







The main advantage of the Yew Weaver is that it&#39;s an easy Hogwarts Legacy broom to buy, available from Spintwitches Sporting Needs in Hogsmeade. For only 600 galleons, this broom is sure to get the job done, but it&#39;s unlikely to be a major draw for players otherwise. A corkscrew twist in the wood toward the end of the handle provides the main flair here for a broom that is otherwise a mostly practical affair. None of the Hogwarts Legacy brooms are outright bad, but the Yew Weaver is one that just doesn&#39;t stand out.





 12  Moon Trimmer 
Purchased From Spintwitches Sporting Needs In Hogsmeade
        

The shaping of the Moon Trimmer broom in Hogwarts Legacy might be even simpler than the Yew Weaver, but the broom makes up for it by accessorizing. Pouches near the tail showcase the space for some necessities, although these are cosmetic features that don&#39;t increase inventory space in Hogwarts Legacy. A lantern hanging from the other end makes this the kind of broom aesthetically suited to students who like to sneak out on the Hogwarts grounds at night. Like the Yew Weaver, the Moon Trimmer broomstick is available for purchase from Albie Weekes&#39; store, Spintwitches Sporting Needs, for 600 galleons.





 11  Wind Wisp 
Purchased From Spintwitches Sporting Needs In Hogsmeade
        

The Wind Wisp broom also comes from Spintwitches Sporting Needs store in Hogsmeade for the same 600 galleon price tag. It features a similar hanging lantern to the Moon Trimmer, but makes for a better Hogwarts Legacy broom thanks to its visibly increased comfort. The shaped seat here would no doubt make a big difference on long flights, and it works as part of a generally interesting silhouette. The Wind Wisp is still an overall basic design that can&#39;t reach the level of the best brooms in Hogwarts Legacy, but as a broom available from Spintwitches, it still makes for a solid beginner&#39;s choice.





 10  Ember Dash 
Purchased From Spintwitches Sporting Needs In Hogsmeade
        

The Ember Dash is one of the starting options, but its fiery motif makes it a strong contender among brooms in Hogwarts Legacy. As its name would imply, the bristles of the broom are imbued with embers, which give it a warm flair. It&#39;s elegantly simple in its design, with silver detailing and a couple of dangling accessories, but this allows the star of the show to shine (or rather, flicker). The Ember Dash is a prime choice for Gryffindor students wanting to show off their House&#39;s element of fire. Surprisingly, the Ember Dash broomstick is still the same 600 galleon price from Albie Weekes&#39; Hogsmeade store.





 9  Lickety Swift 
Reward For Pop Balloons Tier 2 Challenge


 







The Lickety Swift broom in Hogwarts Legacy is much more practical than the Ember Dash, as it&#39;s missing the flaming bristles and instead features a quaint picnic basket on the back of the broomstick. Although it sadly isn&#39;t possible to use this as extra storage, it certainly makes sense from a roleplaying standpoint. Plus, with a large, comfortable seat, players can rest assured that their character is flying through the air not only in style, but also in comfort. To get the Lickety Swift broomstick, players must complete Tier 2 of Madame Kogawa&#39;s challenge of popping the balloons that are seen around the area.





 8  Aeromancer 
Purchased From Rohan Prakash&#39;s Wanderer Shop
        

The Aeromancer is a thematically sound Hogwarts Legacy broom for students with a predisposition for potion-brewing. Its short black bristles, slightly crooked shape, and small silver cauldron hanging from the front make it look like something that Professor Sharp would use. It&#39;s a shame that the Aeromancer can&#39;t be used to make Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s potions on the go, but it&#39;s a fun way for players to show off their favorite subject while they &#34;cut through the air like a potioneer slicing ingredients.&#34; Aeromancer is one of the brooms that are unique to a Wanderer Shop in Hogwarts Legacy. In particular, this one is only found at Rohan Prakash&#39;s traveling store at a cost of 3,000 galleons.





 7  Family Antique 
Purchased From Priya Treadwell&#39;s Wanderer Shop
        

The Family Antique broom certainly lives up to its name with a look that&#39;s undoubtedly dated, even in a game that takes place in the 1890s. This broomstick features disheveled black bristles, a dark, crooked handle, and a seat that&#39;s barely there. It probably isn&#39;t the most comfortable choice, but its simplicity makes it a novel broom choice in Hogwarts Legacy regardless. Plus, its dark color scheme and twisted features make it an intuitive choice for Slytherin students or those who use the Unforgivable Curses. This Family Antique is only found at Priya Treadwell&#39;s Wanderer Shop for a hefty price tag of 2,500 galleons.

Slytherins have a bad reputation in the Harry Potter universe, and Hogwarts Legacy looks like it continues their stereotype of wickedness.








 6  Night Dancer 
Reward For Pop Balloons Tier 1 Challenge
        

The Night Dancer broom is more refined than the Family Antique broom, but it still possesses a slight tinge of the macabre befitting any player who chooses Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s dark wizard path. Its long, black bristles are adorned with metal bands, which keep the broom looking sleek and calculated, but the cushioned blue seat also gives it a regal flair reminiscent of the Ravenclaw House. Whether students choose to become evil or stick to the path of light, the Night Dancer broom will announce their status as a superior witch or wizard. The broom is obtained after completing the first Tier 1 challenge of Pop Balloons from Madame Kogawa.





 5  Sky Scythe 
Purchased From Leopold Babcocke&#39;s Wanderer Shop
        

The Sky Scythe is one of the best Hogwarts Legacy brooms thanks to its eccentric style. Forest green bristles streaked with black make this broomstick stand out from the rest of the options, which sport neutral-colored bristles. Meanwhile, the handle is covered in intricate detailing, such as red and silver grooves carved into the wood, a striking yellow seat, and even a bowed tip. The precise curves and bold color choices make the Sky Scythe just as eye-catching from up close as it is from down below. It is also one of the more expensive choices in the game, with a price of 5,000 galleons and only available at Leopold Babcocke&#39;s Wanderer Shop.





 4  Hogwarts House Broom 
Purchased From Spintwitches Sporting Needs In Hogsmeade


 







Although the Hogwarts House broom is rather plain in its design, it&#39;s still one of Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s best brooms because it&#39;s the only model that allows players to show off their House spirit. The colors and emblem at the base of the handle, alongside the two long ribbons, will change depending on whichever faction the protagonist chooses at the start of the game. It&#39;s a simple touch, but students who strongly identify with their House&#39;s values or traits will find that the Hogwarts House broom is a gratifying choice. It&#39;s also easily accessible as one of the starter brooms in Spintwitches Sporting Needs in Hogsmeade for the standard price of only 600 galleons.





 3  Wild Fire 
Reward For Pop Balloons Tier 3 Challenge
        

The Wild Fire model is quite similar to the Ember Dash, but it takes its fiery intensity a step further, making it one of the best choices in Hogwarts Legacy when it comes to brooms. Instead of lightly smoldering, the bristles on this broomstick are actually ablaze, which is apparent from the blue flames that occasionally peek out from in between. The twisted, asymmetrical handle of the Wild Fire broom stands out as more raw and natural-looking than other models, and the glowing orb at the tip even adds an extra touch of magic. It is also slightly more impressive to own as it only comes as a reward for completing the Pop Balloons Tier 3 challenge, which begins to get increasingly difficult by this stage.





 2  Silver Arrow 
Purchased From Arn&#39;s Wanderer Shop
        

The Silver Arrow can only be found at Arn&#39;s Wanderer Shop after completing a series of side quests for Arn to return his cart for him. It costs a pricey 5,000 galleons, but to those familiar with Harry Potter lore, the Silver Arrow broom may ring a bell. This model is famous for being the fastest of its time, even being the direct predecessor to the more modern Cleansweep series, a detail that helps keep Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s flying brooms canon with its source material. While it might not be as recognizable as Harry&#39;s Firebolt or Nimbus 2000, it&#39;s bound to make wizarding world lore buffs smile.
Not only is the Silver Arrow broom significant to the main series, but it&#39;s also one of the best-looking brooms in the game. The long, blonde bristles give it an air of refinement, but the gunmetal detailing simultaneously grants it some edge. Its design is much sleeker than that of other broomsticks, and to top it all off, the sharp, angled stick that juts out of the base truly makes its silhouette one-of-a-kind.





 1  Bright Spark 
Reward For Pop Balloons Tier 4 Challenge


 







Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s best broom is the Bright Spark model, which also comes after a lot of work to fully complete the Pop Balloons challenge at Tier 4, successfully finding and popping every balloon in the game. With this broomstick, players can truly get in touch with the night sky, making it a particular favorite for the astronomy-minded Ravenclaw House. Bright Spark features two glowing stars that dangle from the top of the handle, illuminating the path before it and even leaving a trail of golden stardust in its wake. Plus, the curved features add to its whimsical nature, making it the perfect choice for curious astronomers or anyone who&#39;s reaching for the stars. With such qualities, it&#39;s no surprise that the Bright Spark is the best broom in Hogwarts Legacy.
