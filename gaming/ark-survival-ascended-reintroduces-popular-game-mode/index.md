## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended is finally restoring one of the most popular game modes from the original Survival Evolved. Find out how and when.




Ark: Survival Ascended is reintroducing one of the most popular game modes from its predecessor, Ark: Survival Evolved. Survival Ascended is a full remake of Evolved in Unreal Engine 5. It includes a wide range of graphical upgrades, balance tweaks, and a handful of new features to keep the Ark experience up-to-date and interesting.




But there are still many features missing from Ark: Survival Ascended. While some of them are easily overlooked, others change the game entirely, and make it hard to justify leaving Survival Evolved behind. While many of these features will doubtless be reintroduced in future updates to Ark: Survival Ascended, for the time being, many of them are conspicuously absent from the game. However, one of the original Ark&#39;s most beloved features is coming to Survival Ascended very soon.

                  Is Ark: Survival Ascended Worth Playing If You Enjoyed Evolved?   Ark: Survival Ascended is a ground-up remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, but is it worth upgrading? Here are the pros and cons for current players.

According to a post on Ark&#39;s official Community Crunch blog, the popular Survival of the Fittest game mode will soon be available in Ark: Survival Ascended. In a departure from the typical Ark survival formula, SOTF is a battle royale game mode. Players drop onto an ever-shrinking map and must scrounge up tools, weapons, and gear in order to be the last one standing. But in addition to the typical mechanics of looting and shooting, SOTF also incorporates a strategic element: players can command packs of dinosaurs. It makes for a delightfully chaotic finish, as dino armies clash and their human masters try not to get trampled underfoot.






 When Will Ark: Survival Ascended Get SOTF Mode? 
          

Survival of the Fittest mode will be added to Ark: Survival Ascended on December 21, 2023, in conjunction with the gameâ€™s Winter Wonderland holiday event. The event includes a wide variety of winter-themed emotes and cosmetics items, along with special XP boosts and, of course, the return of jolly old Raptor Claus. Although the Winter Wonderland event is temporary and ends on January 7, SOTF is here to stay. SOTF is also available for crossplay between PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.

With the introduction of SOTF mode, Ark: Survival Ascended becomes just a little closer to Evolved. However, it&#39;ll be impossible not to compare the two versions, and interesting to see how Ascended changes the game mode. Will it be feature-complete? Will it have bug fixes? Will it have balance tweaks? All will be revealed once Survival of the Fittest is available for Ark: Survival Ascended.
