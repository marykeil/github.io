## Literature Review

There are several recipes to cook and ingredients to farm in Destiny 2. Here is the complete guide for 2023&#39;s edition of the Dawning event.





This year, the annual activity is happening during the Season of the Wish (also known as S23), the same period that reintroduced the Dragon’s Breath Exotic Rocket Launcher in Destiny 2 and set players on a journey to recover Riven’s eggs in order to get assistance from the Ahamkara. They are, however, unrelated, and players do not need to own the season pass in order to play through the gift-delivering missions. The Dawning 2023 introduced a new Glaive called Albedo Wing, which goes along well with some Arc builds in Destiny 2. Before reaping the rewards, however, you will need to cook some gifts and deliver them to your friends.




                  All Starcat Locations in Destiny 2   Guardians looking to earn the Wishbearer Title will need to complete the Familiar Felines Triumph. This is done by collecting all 14 Starcats.   


 Destiny 2: All Recipes In The Dawning 2023 
         

To craft the gifts for your allies during The Dawning 2023, you will need to follow recipes. The mix of specific ingredients leads to the creation of specific foods, and one type of gift can be given out to one specific NPC. Ikora Rey, for instance, only accepts Traveler Donut Holes, whereas the Drifter only takes Dark Chocolate Motes. Quests and bounties will require you to craft different types of gifts for different characters but to do so, you will need to mix the appropriate ingredients in Destiny 2. Recipes unlocked during previous editions of the Dawning in former years will remain, making it easier to craft.




In case you have not unlocked them yet, you will need to manually select the ingredients in the baking oven to craft the gift you need. After a first gift of a specific type is made, the recipe will be registered so that you can easily craft it later on, so long as you have the proper ingredients. The table below lists all of the gifts made available in the Dawning 2023 event in Destiny 2, including the required ingredients, who the gift is intended for, and on what map players can find each of these NPCs to deliver the gifts they make:

 Destiny 2: How To Get Ingredients In The Dawning 2023 (Ingredient Drop Methods) 
          

In order to be able to craft these edible gifts for your allies, you will first need to gather some ingredients. Each recipe requires two ingredients. One of them is of the Uncommon rarity, while the other is considered Rare. Uncommon ingredients are directly related to enemy types. Vex Milk, for instance, drops from Vex opponents, while Dark Ether Cane comes from Scorn enemies. These items are not a guaranteed drop, so will may have to eliminate several creatures of a category before putting your hands on the related ingredient you are looking for.

The second category is Rare ingredients. These items are related to how enemies are defeated and how players operate on the field. Impossible Heat, for example, has a chance of dropping when you eliminate opponents with any type of Solar damage, be that from your subclass abilities or weapons. Flash of Inspiration, on the other hand, can be rewarded when you generate Orbs of Power. Like Uncommon items, Rare ingredients are also not guaranteed drops, so it may take a while to get what you need. The tables below list all the ingredients in the Dawning 2023 for Destiny 2 and how to get them:

The Dawning is an event meant to be played over the course of a few weeks, so you have time to farm all the ingredients and craft all the gifts for your allies during the festive period. This year’s edition of the Dawning in Destiny 2 lasts until January 2 and will be removed following the weekly update.
