# Zelda TOTK Has One Major Plot Hole (&amp; It s Because Of Link)


## SUMMARY 



  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom seemingly includes a plot hole pertaining to the series&#39; established canon regarding its central, recurring conflict.   Despite drawing heavily on the wider Zelda franchise, TOTK only features one version of Link; a hero does not emerge to help Rauru, Zelda, and the Sages seal Ganondorf in the past.   There are a few different possible explanations for such a plot hole, but the game doesn&#39;t provide enough context to definitively explain the situation.

## Literature Review

There is a notable plot hole surrounding Link and the hero’s traditional role in Hyrule in the story of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.




Although The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom does tell a coherent and compelling story, there also seems to be a plot hole regarding Link at the very heart of Hyrule’s latest troubles. Of course, not everything about The Legend of Zelda makes perfect sense - the Zelda timeline is notoriously confusing and convoluted. However, one aspect of TOTK’s usage of Link seems to conflict with the franchise’s established canon in a way that heavily impacts the game’s narrative.




Although TOTK is a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, it is impossible to miss the influence of the wider franchise. The return of Ganondorf and other classic enemies like Gleeoks, as well as more subtle details like the brief inclusion of Koume and Kotake, show that TOTK has drawn heavily on the entire Zelda series to inspire its world. But while there has been great attention given to detail in TOTK’s development, this only makes a certain plot detail stand out all the more.

                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   


 Why Doesn’t Zelda Meet Another Link In TOTK’s Past? 
          

One of the important ongoing aspects of the Zelda series introduced in Skyward Sword, which helps to contextualize much of the franchise, is the Curse of Demise, which guarantees that various versions of Link and Zelda will constantly clash with Ganon/Ganondorf over the millennia. It is presumably this curse which leads to the incarnation of Ganondorf seen in TOTK, who kills Queen Sonia and claims her Secret Stone in his quest for power, leading to the game’s Imprisoning War. However, while Zelda travels back in time to become part of events, there is an equally crucial absence: an incarnation of Link himself.




Whenever Ganondorf rises, both within the Zelda series’ canon and as a part of the games&#39; structure, Link must also appear to battle him. As such, the fact that the hero is entirely absent during Zelda’s time with the Zonai is striking. It seems illogical that there is no ancient incarnation of Link to accompany the Sages of the time as they confront Ganondorf, and perhaps as a result of this, Hyrule essentially falls. Its royal family is decimated, with only Zelda&#39;s own existence to indicate any heir. On top of this, it is only Rauru’s sealing of Ganondorf which prevents Hyrule from being completely destroyed.

It is also somewhat disappointing that there are no interactions between Zelda and another incarnation of Link in TOTK. It would have been very interesting to see the princess’ reaction to another hero, somebody near-identical to her own. Moreover, just as The Legend of Zelda’s Downfall Timeline was created by Link’s possible death in Ocarina of Time, the hypothetical ancient hero could also have died in battle against Ganondorf. This would have been an excellent way to demonstrate Ganondorf’s power, and make the reincarnated hero’s battle with him at the game’s conclusion all the more impactful.




                  Link Fighting Ganondorf In Zelda: TOTK Isn’t Even A Fair Fight   As difficult an opponent as Ganondorf is in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, he is arguably not given a fair fight in the game.   



 The Zonai Era&#39;s Link Could Have Reincarnated After Ganondorf’s Sealing 
          

On the other hand, as Ganondorf was indeed successfully sealed without Link’s intervention, it could be argued that the hero was not needed at this point in time. Instead, the suspiciously Zonai-like Ancient Hero apparently fought off the first emergence of Calamity Ganon alongside his own princess (perhaps a close relative of Sonia and Rauru), as indicated by TOTK’s Ancient Hero’s Aspect armor and its notable similarities to Impa&#39;s tapestry. It seems that this could be the missing Zonai-era Link, who later appeared to deal with the sealed Ganondorf’s first onslaught of Malice, after Zelda&#39;s Draconification, rather than face the Demon King directly.




Although there is no direct confirmation of this series of events being accurate in Tears of the Kingdom, there is precedent for it. It is already apparent that Link does not always show up when evil first emerges in Hyrule. Quite the opposite, in fact; on some occasions, such as in the original The Legend of Zelda, he is instead charged with remedying the consequences of a weakening or broken seal established by others, most often a group of sages. Because of this, it is clear that there is some flexibility in how Link and Ganon will clash as a result of The Curse of Demise.



In addition to various versions of Ganon/Ganondorf, Link has also faced other villains like Vaati and Malladus, who were both sealed prior to Link&#39;s quests to defeat them.




Of course, given the lack of information regarding this period in Hyrule’s history, it is impossible to say for sure if this Zonai Link was truly only incarnated after the Imprisoning War. Another possibility is that, similarly to the Downfall Timeline, Link was killed by Ganondorf long before the Gerudo King’s plot against Rauru’s Hyrule came to fruition. This does not prevent a later reincarnation going on to face Calamity Ganon, and merely provides a different explanation for the same result; with no hero to wield the Master Sword and face Ganon, all the Sages can do is seal Ganondorf away for as long as possible.






 TOTK Doesn&#39;t Offer People A Perfect Backstory 
         

The absence of Link in TOTK’s past is a plot hole, but this is mainly due to the lack of definite context. This is a common theme in TOTK - although much is revealed about Rauru, Mineru, and Sonia as individuals, the wider culture and structure of their Hyrule is still largely a mystery. For example, there are small clues toward the Sheikah Tribe’s origins in TOTK, but again, there is no definitive proof of how the Sheikah and Zonai may have actually interacted. For better or worse, TOTK actively demonstrates just how much of Hyrule’s history is lost to time, leaving only fragmented myths and legends behind.

As deep as TOTK’s lore is, the game can also be vague on certain points, leaving frustrating holes in anyone’s understanding of its world and how it is situated within the wider Zelda canon. The absence of Link during Ganondorf’s attack on the Zonai’s Hyrule is one such hole. Although there are potential explanations for this, such as Link instead being incarnated to deal with Calamity Ganon some time afterward, the fact remains that no clear explanation is given in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for why it only features one version of the iconic hero when Zelda could have easily met a second.
