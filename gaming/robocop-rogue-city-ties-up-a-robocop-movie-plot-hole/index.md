# RoboCop Rogue City Ties Up A RoboCop Movie Plot Hole


## SUMMARY 



  RoboCop: Rogue City fills in the gaps left by the third film, addressing the absence of the iconic villain.   This character&#39;s disappearance in RoboCop 3 is a glaring exclusion that is never explained in the movie&#39;s story.   RoboCop: Rogue City provides a fitting end for the character, with a narrative that ties into the first and second films.

## Literature Review

The RoboCop franchise is an iconic piece of science fiction media, but there&#39;s one massive plot hole in the third movie the new game actually fills. 




Though it&#39;s not often that movie tie-ins make for solid video games, that&#39;s exactly the case with the recent release of RoboCop: Rogue City. A first-person shooter developed by Teyon, Peter Weller of RoboCop 1 and 2 fame reprises his role to take down the criminals and unscrupulous characters of Old Detroit once again. Set after the second RoboCop film, Rogue City picks up where the movies left off and follows the story of Alex Murphy and his partner, Anne Lewis.

RoboCop: Rogue City does more than just reference the movies. As the game delves into the lore of the RoboCop universe, it helps flesh out story elements that were left out of RoboCop 3. One of the biggest unknowns of the film franchise is where the movie&#39;s main antagonist, the Old Man, goes in the third movie. Replaced by a new CEO of OCP and an entirely new actor, it wasn&#39;t the most satisfying end for such an iconic character.

                  &#34;A Great Game &amp; Everything An Adaptation Could Wish For&#34; - RoboCop: Rogue City Review   Robocop: Rogue City delivers an inspired and enthusiastic take on the classic franchise, even if some of its budgetary constraints are apparent.     


 The Old Man Was Never In RoboCop 3 
          




The Old Man is perhaps the RoboCop franchise&#39;s biggest villain, arguably even more devoid of morality than the drug-addled Cain from RoboCop 2. Played by the Oscar-nominated Dan O&#39;Herlihy, the Old Man stood in the RoboCop franchise as a depiction of unbridled capitalism and greed. With a lack of an official name, he stands as just another rich corporate CEO who aims to reach his goals by any means necessary. O&#39;Herlihy failed to reprise his role in RoboCop 3, instead being replaced by another iconic actor, Rip Torn, famous for his roles in the Men in Black films and other major movies and TV shows since the 1950s.

According to a post on the RoboCop Archive with the screenwriter of RoboCop 3, Fred Dekker, the Old Man wasn&#39;t written out of the story, however. Surrounding the reasons why the Old Man wasn&#39;t in the third movie, Dekker states that the actor, who came from a Shakespearean background, thought that the character was &#34;weak,&#34; thus turning down the role.






 A Story Reason Is Never Given For The Old Man&#39;s Disappearance 
          

Though the Old Man is referenced once in a throwaway line as &#34;expendable,&#34; in the third film, how he died is never directly discussed. As such an iconic character in the first two RoboCop films, it&#39;s a seemingly strange decision that the Old Man just evaporated from existence in the third movie. While it&#39;s likely that Dekker&#39;s claims that O&#39;Herlihy turned down the role because he didn&#39;t like the script are likely true, the story in RoboCop 3 never explains why this is the case.

                  Cancelled Robocop Sequel Detailed By Director Neill Blomkamp   Neill Blomkamp details the big plans he had for his now-cancelled Robocop movie, a direct sequel to the original 1987 Paul Verhoeven action classic.    

Though it&#39;s more than reasonable to assume that his lack of an appearance is the result of corporate espionage or just the everyday rotating of seats in the C-suite, it is still a stark exclusion for die-hard fans of the series when watching the movie for the first time.






 RoboCop: Rogue City Fills In The Gaps Between RoboCop 2 And 3 
          

The period when Rogue City takes place is perfect, as it&#39;s a natural area of lore that can be explored and expanded upon. RoboCop 3 differs from the first two RoboCop films in several ways, from tone and cinematography to the cast. The decision to make the ultimate villain the Old Man for Rogue City is especially smart, as it helps fill in the gaps of why he&#39;s excluded from the third film. Rather than being left and forgotten about with a whimper, Teyon crafted a narrative that gave the iconic villain a suitable ending, with a story that ties into the narrative of the first and second movies.

 RoboCop: Rogue City Is A Fitting End For The Iconic Villain 
         

When players first meet Old Man in Rogue City, he&#39;s as his name would imply â€” an older man in failing health. Gone are the days of his imposing executive aura, instead being replaced by the ravages of time and age. Eventually, he passes away from a heart attack and is replaced by the game&#39;s real villain, Max Becker. Much of the story&#39;s plot surrounds the project that the Old Man was working on before his death, Project: Afterlife, which seeks to replicate the technology, at least in some respects, that was responsible for creating RoboCop.

Toward the end of the game&#39;s narrative, the Old Man is revived in the form of the RoboCop2 model, a similar robot to Cain&#39;s robot, the fanatical leader of the Nuke Cult from the second RoboCop film and that movie&#39;s main villain. This results in a super-powered Old Man taking on Murphy in a final showdown. Though this is just one of many callbacks to the original films, for fans of the original movie that debuted in 1987, it&#39;s one that will be more than familiar.






 The Old Man Is The Most Evil Character In RoboCop 
          

Though the Old Man dying at the cusp of a discovery that could grant him immortality is a fitting end for such a disgusting character, it&#39;s somewhat underwhelming ultimately. After all, out of all the horrid personalities and corrupt characters in the RoboCop franchise, the Old Man is quite possibly the worst. Though some may not agree, many of the other main characters in the movies and game have some level of understandable drive or motivation behind their actions.

                  RoboCop: Rogue City Ending Explained (In Detail)   RoboCop: Rogue City is a phenomenal game that gives the player plenty of choice. Perhaps the most important decision they can make - how it all ends.    

Though it could be argued that Clarence Boddicker and his gang kill and steal for no reason, at least they have the excuse of being a product of their environment, much like a veritable trove of other gangs in Old Detroit. Even Dick Jones, though his motivations are terrible, is somewhat understandable as he&#39;s just trying to climb the corporate ladder. The Old Man, on the other hand, has no such excuse as he lives high in the towers with a life of wealth and privilege as CEO of Omni Consumer Products.




The Old Man, a person who has it all, was never bothered with hurting other people. In fact, it was quite the afterthought in his goal to build the perfect dystopian society in Delta City. The treatment that he&#39;s given in RoboCop: Rogue City is truly a fitting end for such a sad human, as his hubris ultimately served as his fatal blow.
