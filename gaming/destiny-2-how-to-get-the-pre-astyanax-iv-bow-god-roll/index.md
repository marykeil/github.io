## Literature Review

The Pre Astyanax IV is a new legendary Bow added in Season of the Witch in Destiny 2. Find how to get the God Roll from a Vanguard Nightfall.





The Pre Astyanax IV drops from the Heist Battleground: Mars in the Vanguard Nightfall playlist. This activity was originally released in Season of the Chosen in Destiny 2. Higher difficulty will increase the chances of obtaining the desired weapon. During a normal Nightfall, the Pre Astyanax IV is not guaranteed in the final reward chest. Defeating champions adds to the fireteam&#39;s score, giving a rank at the end of the activity. Guardians should take advantage of the weeks with double Nightfall rewards for the best opportunity.

Once one copy of the Pre Astyanax IV Bow is acquired, subsequent copies can be purchased from Commander Zaval in The Tower for one Vanguard Engram, 25 Legendary Shards, and 20,000 Glimmer. Guardians can also challenge Heist Battleground: Mars on Grandmaster difficulty for a chance to obtain an Adept version of the Bow. This will allow for Adept Mods in Destiny 2 to be equipped. However, this version is vastly more challenging and requires a higher light level to enter. Guardians will always be at a disadvantage in Grandmaster difficulty and the missions have modifiers to increase the challenge.



For defeating all champions and earning a Platinum Rank, the desired Adept Nightfall weapon is guaranteed in the reward chest.
