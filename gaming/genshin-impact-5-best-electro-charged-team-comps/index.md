## Literature Review

While Electro-Charged is not the most popular Elemental Reaction in Genshin Impact, it is quite powerful. Here are the best team comps to trigger it.





This can be a dangerous reaction to play with, as you are at the risk of getting shocked yourself if you are not careful, but it does pay off when opponents start disappearing from the battlefield. Luckily, there are multiple characters to choose from and various team comps that you can build in order to properly spread Electro-Charged on enemies. Mixing and matching specific Hydro and Electro characters in Genshin Impact is key to building the best team comps that revolve around Electro-Charged.









 








 5  F2P Electro-Charged Team In Genshin Impact 
Use A Party Of Free Characters
        

There are a few ways of building a completely F2P (free-to-play) Electro-Charged team comp. One of the strongest ones has Barbara as a healer and the secondary Hydro spreader in the team. The main character responsible for spreading Hydro is Xingqiu, who works as the team’s sub-DPS. Xingqiu is frequently referred to as one of the best F2P characters in the game and is ever-present in the national team build in Genshin Impact. With his great off-field Hydro application, he makes the job for the rest of the party much easier.
  F2P Electro-Charged Team Comp    Main DPS   Fischl or Beidou        Sub-DPS   Xingqiu        Support   Lynette or Fischl        Healer   Barbara        
The main DPS slot is a little more complicated to work with, but an offensive Electro character like Beidou or Fischl could work – Fischl is better suited as an off-field sub-DPS and support unit, but she can be used for this F2P team comp. The last slot is that of a support character and should be occupied by a character that can help with Elemental Reactions. A free Lynette in Genshin Impact can inflict Swirl to better infuse Hydro and Electro, though Fischl could also play this role as a second sub-DPS unit and another character that spreads Electro.





 4  Electro Childe Team In Genshin Impact 
Childe Will Spread Hydro &amp; Electro With Melee Strikes
        

Using Childe as an agile and constant Hydro DMG DPS is also valid. Of course, Childe will need to be supported by a staff of characters that can help him trigger the Electro-Charged Elemental Reaction. The best way of ensuring this is using a character that deals off-field Electro DMG. Using Raiden Shogun or Fischl as the team’s sub-DPS is an easy way of ensuring that not only will Electro be spread while they are not on the field, but they can also work as batteries, pushing Energy Recharge into the party’s members. With Childe in Genshin Impact actively striking with Hydro, the other will be off-field, spreading Electro.
  Electro Childe Team Comp    Main DPS   Childe        Sub-DPS   Raiden Shogun or Fischl        Support   Kazuha        Healer   Kokomi or Kuki Shinobu        
A team comp like this could use Kokomi as the main healer, also capable of constantly spreading Hydro when off-field, while healing the active character. Of course, if you need extra Electro application, you can use Kuki Shinobu as the healer. The best support for this team comp with Childe at the forefront is Kazuha. The Anemo character in Genshin Impact is capable of gathering enemies in a single spot, making it much easier for Childe’s short-range melee attacks to hit multiple opponents at once, while also helping with Elemental spread.





 3  Raiden Shogun DPS Team In Genshin Impact 
The Electro Archon Can Make Lighting Strike Twice In The Same Spot


 







An alternative to having Childe in the DPS slot is using Raiden Shogun in Genshin Impact as the main damage dealer in the team comp. Inazuma’s Archon is one of the best Electro characters in the game and is capable of thoroughly spreading Electro without much of an effort thanks to the short cooldown for her Elemental Skill. To help her activate Electro-Charged, you should use a Hydro sub-DPS, and Yelan and Xingqiu are great for the job. Though their main source of Hydro application comes from their Bursts, they deal a lot of damage.
  Raiden Shogun DPS Team Comp    Main DPS   Raiden Shogun        Sub-DPS   Yelan or Xingqiu        Support   Fischl or Kazuha        Healer   Kokomi or Barbara        
As a support character, you can use Fischl, as she will act as a secondary unit spreading Electro, but, most importantly, will be the battery for the team, responsible for feeding Energy to her party members – alternatively, you can always use Kazuha to help spread reactions, especially if Raiden Shogun is already powered up on Energy Recharge. The last slot is that of a healer in Genshin Impact. Because Yelan and Xingqiu rely heavily on their Burst, it is best if you use a Hydro healer instead of Kuki Shinobu. You can utilize Kokomi or Barbara for this purpose. Both spread off-field Hydro decently, so they are good options.





 2  Ayato Hydro DPS Team In Genshin Impact 
The Head Of The Kamisato Clan Deals Constant Hydro DMG
        

If you prefer Hydro as your main source of damage and do not have Childe, you can use Ayato Kamisato in Genshin Impact. The 5-star character from Inazuma is a solid and consistent source of Hydro application and is capable of dealing a lot of damage. To aid him, it is best if Ayato is paired up with Raiden Shogun as the off-field Electro sub-DPS. With his Hydro strikes granted by his Elemental Skill, he will be assisted by Raiden Shogun’s Electro attacks. Alternatively, you can use Fischl as a substitute for the Electro Archon.
  Ayato DPS Team Comp    Main DPS   Ayato Kamisato        Sub-DPS   Raiden Shogun or Fischl        Support   Fischl or Lisa        Healer   Kokomi or Barbara        
The support slot should be occupied by a secondary Electro unit. If you use Raiden Shogun as your sub-DPS, then use Fischl as a support for Energy Recharge. If you use Fischl as your sub-DPS, you can use Lisa to spread more Electro DMG on the field. The healer for this team should be Kokomi or Barbara. Not only will they help with the Hydro spread in Genshin Impact, thus triggering Electro-Charged, but they will also activate Hydro Resonance. This will then increase the team’s Max HP and, consequently, further boost Ayato’s damage output, as he relies on a high HP score.





 1  Neuvillette DPS Team In Genshin Impact 
The Iudex Can Shoot A Hydro-Electro Cannon
        

If your desire is to use Neuvillette in Genshin Impact as the main Hydro DPS, that is possible. The Chief Justice of Fontaine will require help from Electro units to get the Electro-Charged Reaction working, but that is simple to arrange. With Raiden Shogun or Fischl as the sub-DPS, they can inflict off-field Electro DMG that will work in a collaborative manner with Neuvillette’s Charged Attack. The support role is a little loose, but Kazuha or Sucrose are great choices to spread the elements and regenerate Energy. For a healer, you will want a very powerful one.
  Neuvillette DPS Team Comp    Main DPS   Neuvillette        Sub-DPS   Raiden Shogun or Fischl        Support   Kazuha or Sucrose        Healer   Kokomi or Barbara        
Using a secondary Hydro unit like Kokomi or Barbara is recommended, as Hydro Resonance will be activated. Like Ayato, Neuvillette’s offensive abilities scale off his Max HP, so his powers will be augmented by the Hydro Resonance. Another reason to have a solid healer is the fact that Neuvillette loses HP by using his Charged Attack. While these are all recommended Electro-Charged team comps, you can always mix and match characters like Furina or Yae Miko to trigger the reaction in Genshin Impact.
