  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Lamplighters League is a turn-based tactics video game praised for its characters, gameplay, and unique aesthetic.   Composer Jon Everist created a jazz-inspired main theme for the game, with randomized saxophone solos performed by a friend.   Everist had to consider the game&rsquo;s interactive nature when composing the score, assigning different solo instruments to each character and creating ambient tracks that respond to player actions.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Composer Jon Everist discusses his continued collaboration with game studio Harebrained Schemes and his unique score for The Lamplighters League.</p>
<p>The Lamplighters League is a turn-based tactics video game with a pulpy, noir aesthetic. The game was developed by Harebrained Schemes, the company behind 2018’s BattleTech and Shadowrun Returns, and published by Paradox Interactive. The Lamplighters League earned favorable reviews thanks to its winning blend of characters, rewarding gameplay, and unique tone.</p>
<p>To complete the game’s vintage feel in a way that complemented the wide range of locations and characters players get to know, the developers turned to composer Jon Everist. Everist previously scored BattleTech for the studio, as well as Shadowrun: Hong Kong. Outside of Harebrained Schemes projects, Everist has contributed music to AAA projects like Overwatch 2 and PUBG.</p>
<pre><code>              Most Anticipated Video Games of 2023   2023 has plenty of games scheduled to be released, including some from popular franchises like Resident Evil, Zelda, Star Wars, and Final Fantasy.

<p>Jon Everist spoke with Screen Rant about writing music fit for The Lamplighters League’s cast of characters, the range of music in the game, and more. Note: This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>Jon Everist on The Lamplighters League</p>
<p>Screen Rant: I love the main theme, and I can’t think of another main theme that has a jazz solo in the middle of it. I’d love to know how that came together.</p>
<p>Jon Everist: This game takes place in an alternate 1930s; it’s kind of the jazz era. I’m not a jazz composer or musician and don&rsquo;t claim to be knowledgeable of that realm beyond listening to records and [hearing] my jazz friends play. Given that it&rsquo;s a video game and we have a pretty big amount of freedom to do some interesting things with how the music system functions, I thought that it would be interesting to have a section of the main theme that actually changes depending on when you&rsquo;re opening the game.
That portion that you&rsquo;re talking about is a really good friend of mine, Nick Toretta, who is a brilliant, brilliant saxophone player. He’s also doing clarinet and flute as well. What happens is each time you turn on the game, those solos will randomize. He laid down a bunch of improv over a really basic backing track that we recorded at Abbey Road. He did three or four instruments, and then I spliced that up and put it in the system, and each time the system will actually choose from different pieces in a live way. Of course, on the record, I chose my favorite bits and edited them together.</p>
<p>The score in general is really melodic and beautifully orchestrated. Did that make it more difficult than normal to write in a way where your music can do all the things that video game music needs to do in terms of having cut points and things like that?</p>
<p>Jon Everist: That’s always a consideration; always a battle. I like to be in projects very early so I can essentially set up a cue list from the very beginning based on the structure of the system that we&rsquo;re using so that we can pick and choose where we’re going to go all-out with a tutti orchestra, everyone playing together in the same room, or where I might want to be more strategic with my ensemble choice and make sure that I have ultimate flexibility. We tried to record the score striped by strings, brass, and woodwinds together, and then percussion in general. We also have a string trio that is separate as well, and then we&rsquo;ve got, like, 15 different soloists that are separated from that as well.
Ultimately, many of these tracks are quite interactive. The most interactive tracks are obviously going to be the ambient tracks. We set these up really early as well, tying into the nature of the game itself. You&rsquo;re a ragtag group of people coming together; “The best of the worst”, as they like to call them in the game. I knew that I wanted to have some musical feedback with that, depending on which character you&rsquo;re controlling.
You have four characters that you can control at a time, [and] we decided to tie a soloist instrument to each character. If you switch to Lateef, who is a sneaky character, you&rsquo;ll hear a pair of clarinets come up and take over the soloistic parts of the piece. That happens with all characters. That was a big consideration to take into account from the start that changed the way that I structured the recording of the ambient pieces in particular.</p>
<p>You’ve also worked with this studio on previous titles. Does that make the whole process a lot easier? Are you able to be involved as early as you want to be involved because you have that relationship?</p>
<p>Jon Everist: Definitely. I think that is a key with myself and Harebrained Schemes. We&rsquo;ve worked together for, I think, 10 years, which is crazy to think about. There’s a lot of trust going both ways.
I get pitches from them quite early, and that gets the gears turning. In the case of Lamplighters League, I actually wrote the main theme based on just a pitch, which was a few concept art pieces and a very generous overview of the world that they&rsquo;re creating for this game, and the vibe that they&rsquo;re going for. It was kind of the same with BattleTech and other games too.
They set me off on an initial sort of game Bible that they&rsquo;re working on, and what ends up happening is I write a piece of music. If they like it, they send it on to the team, the artists, and the writers. They start improvising off that, they get inspired, they start writing more stuff, and then I get inspired by the stuff they&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>In listening through the soundtrack, you have a lot of pieces that go to very different places. How did you keep that all cohesive?</p>
<p>Jon Everist: I don&rsquo;t generally like to think of soundtracks as one product; I really like to approach games as an evolution of a story, or trying to start at point A and end at point B. With this game, there really is sort of a slow unveiling, almost like a bait and switch, where, when you first start, it feels like you&rsquo;re in a heist game with a group of people who are ne’er-do-wells. Then, as the game progresses, a story starts to unfold that’s pretty supernatural, and there&rsquo;s this occult, magic-is-real-but-grounded-in-science thing going on.
The characters in the game who are the most un-spiritual or grounded people are seeing magic for the first time in front of their faces, and having to come to terms with that. Then, of course, as the story unfolds, we see that this is really a struggle for the fate of the whole planet. So we wanted to ground ourselves in the alternate 1930s with things like the main theme and some of the earlier pieces, but then the unfolding of this apocalyptic vibe also gave me a lot of freedom to start going off in different directions, which was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Was there anything you got to do on this game that felt particularly different and exciting?</p>
<p>Jon Everist: The last game that we had done was Necropolis, which was a sci-fi, fantasy, magical dungeon-crawler, and before that, it was BattleTech. Both of those games really lead with synthetic elements, synths, interesting textures, and stuff like that. There are really no synths in this entire score, except for a few pieces that represent key moments in the game. They’re not actually synths; they’re recordings from the orchestra that are being manipulated, mangled, and stuff like that. That was something that was very unique to this score [and] with my relationship with Harebrained Schemes: sticking strictly to the orchestra and not relying on synthetic elements.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite theme you were able to write for this? It seems like there are more straight-up themes in this than a lot of other games.</p>
<p>Jon Everist: [In terms of] the inspiration for this game, there are touchstones like Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and that sort of thing, and [those film scores] are written by composers who I deeply admire. [I] don&rsquo;t want to mimic at all, but one thing that is a touchstone for the action-adventure films from the ‘80s, ‘90s, and early 2000s is really heavy thematic elements. Oftentimes, I find myself trying to be a little more sneaky with themes, just because of the nature of video games and the fact that people could be playing for hundreds of hours, and you don&rsquo;t want to drive them too crazy with thematic elements.
For this project, I did want to focus on very dramatic writing and making sure that I was scoring it as if it was one of these great films that have inspired us. That was a challenge, and also quite a lot of fun. It’s funnest way to write. It&rsquo;s also, after you hit your head against the wall and find the theme that&rsquo;s working, quite easy to write after that, because you can recap themes and reuse your own writing.
As for one from the score that I really like, I think one that was really fun to record was “Going Loud”. It was the first combat track that we had to record, and hearing it erupt in the studio was an incredible experience. Being in the room and hearing this low brass concert in the very room in which some of these scores that are so inspiring to me were recorded was a very surreal experience.</p>
