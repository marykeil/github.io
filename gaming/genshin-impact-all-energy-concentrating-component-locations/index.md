## Literature Review

Gather all the Energy Concentrating Components in Genshin Impact, and unlock a special treasure in Fontaine. Here are their exact locations.





The “Road to the Singularity” World Quest is not particularly long or difficult, but the aforementioned items are part of a side objective that is not too clearly stated by the game. Because of this, locating the seven Energy Concentrating Components scattered across the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region and the Liffey Region can be troublesome. Luckily, all seven of these items spawn in fixed points, so it is possible to establish a route to grab all of them. Unlocking the Energy Concentrating Components usually only requires a simple battle, but you should use solid team comps in Genshin Impact to ensure you come out victorious.

 7 Energy Concentrating Component Locations In Genshin Impact 
         

In total, there are seven Energy Concentrating Components spread across various locations to the north and northwest of the Court of Fontaine. The first copy of the item you should pursue is at the far north of the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region, in a small pond slightly southwest of the nearby Teleport Waypoint. To obtain the item, you will need to defeat two Clockwork Meka opponents. These opponents are not terribly difficult and should be easily taken down, especially if you are making use of the Pneuma and Ousia mechanics in Genshin Impact. Once both opponents are defeated, they will drop an Energy Concentrating Component.






You can obtain most of the Energy Concentrating Components even if you have not started the “Road to the Singularity” World Quest. Two of them, however, are locked behind the progress in the questline.




The second Energy Concentrating Component you can obtain without starting the World Quest is located in a secret cave that requires some exploring. To get there, you will first need to locate the arena in which the Millennial Pearl Seahorse resides. Upon reaching the destination, you will need to circle around the world boss in Genshin Impact – or defeat it, if you prefer – and reach a pool at the far end of the arena. From there, you will dive and navigate through an underwater tunnel until you reach another cave. Here, you will encounter a single Clockwork Meka opponent, who will drop the item once it is defeated.

You can check the location of the items in the image below, as highlighted over the official Interactive Map on HoYoLAB:

          




To obtain the third Energy Concentrating Component, you will also need to endure some underwater exploration. In fact, the opponent you need to face is underwater in Genshin Impact. The first step is teleporting to the waypoint immediately south of the Millennial Pearl Seahorse’s location on the map and then swim north, where you will encounter a submarine-like underwater Clockwork Meka. To beat this opponent without much of a struggle, you should absorb the powers of the nearby Fontemer Aberrant, the Xenochromatic Jellyfish. This will allow you to throw and detonate strong bombs. Using a few of these should be enough to obliterate the opponent.

The next Energy Concentrating Component location is situated to the far east of the Liffey Region. The opponent who drops it is, once again, a Clockwork Meka construct. It is located at the top of a broken bridge section in Mont Esus East. To get there, you will need to teleport to the only Waypoint at that location (so far) and then head northwest. Upon reaching the bridge in Genshin Impact, you will need to climb it and then grab the nearby Ousia orb to activate the Pneuma construct near the enemy and initiate the fight against the Clockwork Meka. Once it has fallen, you will obtain the desired item.






The Ousia Block can be found directly in front of the Clockwork Meka, a distance away from it, onto the bridge. Interact with it, run back to the device near the opponent and attack the device in order to start the battle.




The fifth Energy Concentrating Component that can be acquired without starting the “Road to the Singularity” World Quest is also located in the Liffey Region, just north of the Court of Fontaine. To get there, you can teleport to the Statue of the Seven near the coast and move southwest, or to the nearby Teleport Waypoint and head northwest. In the plains near a rock cliff, you will encounter a Construction Specialist Mek, which seems like an excavating machine in Genshin Impact. Interrupt its operations and beat it, and you will automatically drop the Energy Concentrating Component. The next two will require you to progress with the quest.

The sixth and seventh Energy Concentrating Components are dropped in a bundle, so you only need to go to one location to get both of them. Access to the “Road to the Singularity” World Quest is through a large tunnel entrance on the west coast of the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region in Genshin Impact. Once inside, you will need to use an Ousia Block to activate a Pneuma device and get access to the elevator, which will take you to the quest. After a few dialogue sessions and some exploration through the recently discovered area, you will be prompted to defeat Clockwork Meka.






If you are having trouble locating the entrance to the tunnel that leads to Kuisel&#39;s Clockwork Workshop, simply follow the western road north, as it will bend eastward and lead straight into the cave.




There are two Clockwork Meka opponents in a large circular arena. Once they are defeated, you will automatically obtain two Energy Concentrating Components. This will conclude the farming for the items. It is important to note that the order in which you gather these materials is not really important. As long as you gather all seven Energy Concentrating Components, you will be able to unlock a special hidden treasure in Genshin Impact.



 How To Use Energy Concentrating Components In Genshin Impact (Unlock Luxurious Chest) 
          

These seven Energy Concentrating Components are the key items in activating a mechanism that unlocks the cage that holds a Luxurious Chest inside Kuisel&#39;s Clockwork Workshop. By interacting with it, you will open the cage and, thus, be able to claim the rewards from the treasure chest. The Luxurious Chest contains 30x Primogems, 3x Hero’s Wits, and an Artifact piece. Collecting all the items is not very difficult, but it does take some time. Hopefully, knowing the exact locations of the Energy Concentrating Components in Genshin Impact can shorten your gathering efforts and allow you to open the treasure easily.
