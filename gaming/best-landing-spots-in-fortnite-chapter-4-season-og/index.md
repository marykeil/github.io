## Literature Review

Fortnite Chapter 4 Season OG brings players back to the original island. Classic locations and landmarks are among this season&#39;s best landing spots.





Fortnite’s return to Chapter 1 is out now, and you can experience this blast from the past until December 2nd. The island map will still change every week, as Epic moves the Fortnite island map forward through time. Classic Points of Interest will reappear, and legacy items will be unvaulted. However, many of the game’s best landing spots are already present, and ready to receive players both old and new.





 The Best Landing Spots In Fortnite Chapter 4 Season OG 
         

Season OG’s best landing spots include classic Points of Interest such as Tilted Towers: ideal for squads who enjoy fast-paced early-game battles. To balance those out, there are also lesser-known locations and landmarks for solos and duos who might enjoy quieter starting positions.



If you’re a longtime Fortnite player, you might be able to rely on your own experience to find the best landing spots from previous seasons. However, things aren’t exactly the same.






 Tilted Towers 
          




A classic Fortnite location from seasons past, Tilted Towers makes a long-awaited return in Season OG. It’s since been eclipsed in size by locations such as MEGA City, one of the best landing spots in Chapter 4 Season 3, but it’s still one of the best landing spots in the game.

Tilted Towers is a small, but dense urban area with several high-rise buildings stuffed with useful weapons and loot chests. It’s also close to the center of the island map, ensuring that most if not all Battle Bus routes pass over it. The amount of available loot here attracts a lot of foot traffic every match, making it an excellent choice for players who want to start their matches with winner-takes-all firefights.



When lots of players land at Tilted Towers, it can be difficult to find good weapons. Make sure to time your drops, and check rooftops for guns.




It’s also worth noting that there’s more to Tilted Towers than just loot. It’s one of the most famous and well-loved locations ever introduced to the game, and it’s a big part of Fortnite’s ongoing story. With its place cemented in Fortnite lore, the chance to revisit will prove irresistible for older fans of the game. You can expect Tilted Towers to be busy at all times.






 Pleasant Park 
          

Pleasant Park was introduced in the very first iteration of Fortnite Battle Royale and is one of the oldest Points of Interest in the game. The area contains a big picnic area and soccer field in the middle, surrounded by a row of houses that all contain guns, equipment, and loot chests. As such, you can expect to run into a few other players when landing here, but the loot is spread out over a large area, giving you a bit of extra breathing room.

It’s a popular location that was present for many of Fortnite’s best seasons, although it doesn’t quite match up to the popularity of Tilted Towers. The open areas in the middle of Pleasant Park make it the ideal choice for anyone who enjoys scoring eliminations from long range. It also has wide and long streets that are relatively clutter-free, providing clear sight lines and easy kills for players with good reflexes.






 Loot Lake 
          

Loot Lake’s main attraction is its central island, which has an abandoned mansion that creates king-of-the-hill situations in most matches. There’s a limited amount of loot present, forcing anyone who lands there to get creative when it comes to eliminating their opponents. It’s a challenge, regardless of whether you’re playing solo or grouping up in a squad with friends.

The shores of Loot Lake are also a great landing spot for less confident players. The lake is ringed with buildings of various shapes and sizes, which often contain all the weapons and equipment items you’ll need to be competitive. There’s also another island in Loot Lake that links the whole area together with a system of ziplines, making it easy to get around and ambush your opponents from unexpected angles.






 Viking Village 
          

A lesser-known landmark, the Viking Village can be found in between Snobby Shores, Tilted Towers, and Greasy Grove: all popular Points of Interest that attract the lion’s share of players in most matches. The Viking Village isn’t marked on players’ maps, so it’s less likely to attract a lot of attention. It’s a smaller location, with Viking-themed buildings and a longboat that unfortunately isn’t going anywhere fast.

Despite its smaller size, there’s a decent amount of ground loot to be found here, and exploring the buildings will reveal a few loot chests that can be cracked open for extra items. Putting together an arsenal of weapons and gear is relatively stress-free thanks to the absence of other players who might challenge your claim. From there, you can take advantage of the Viking Village’s central location to quickly get back inside the storm circle with a competitive loadout.






A few season-exclusive Fortnite vehicles will reappear later in the season, allowing you to travel faster across the island.






 Risky Reels 
          

Risky Reels is the Fortnite island’s humble drive-in movie theater. It’s a small area that’s packed with loot chests, making it a fantastic landing spot for gathering a lot of good starting gear very quickly. It’s also relatively quiet, as the northern part of the island tends to see lower player counts compared to the busier and denser western and central regions.

However, you’ll sometimes still see a few people choosing Risky Reels as their landing spot, so you’ll want to keep an eye out when leaping from the Battle Bus. It’s also close to two other excellent locations: Tomato Temple and Wailing Woods. In isolation, neither location has much to offer other than standard loot and building materials. However, choosing to land at Risky Reels allows you to plot an easy route through all three locations for maximum gear and resource gain.






 Lucky Landing 
          

First added during a Lunar New Year celebration, it’s worth visiting Lucky Landing just to see its unique architecture. The best spot to land here is the tower just outside town, which provides a fantastic lookout point. Lucky Landing essentially has everything your squad might need to succeed, including weapons and gear, as well as vehicles and a Reboot Van you can use to summon dead squadmates back into the game.

As a bonus, it’s also close to Fatal Fields, another fantastic location for pitched battles. Fatal Fields is dense and has dozens of clever hiding spots, allowing your squad to lose enemies and set up nasty ambushes on anyone who dares to pass through.

These are just some of the best landing spots in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season OG. However, each and every Named Location and Landmark has something to recommend it. It’s worth experimenting with which drop zones suit you and your squad best. Choosing the right landing spot is a decision that can make or break a match, but how well you play and coordinate with your team matters just as much, if not more.
