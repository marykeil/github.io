## Literature Review

PlayStationâ€™s exclusive party battler, Foamstars, is coming soon for players to enjoy all the foam-blasting frenzy fun, complete with rubber ducks.




Square Enix&#39;s upcoming party shooter game, Foamstars, is coming soon to PlayStation consoles and will be free for the first month following its launch. The 4v4 battle game gives a colorful and soapy twist on traditional shooters, likely drawing some inspiration from Nintendo&#39;s hit multiplayer shooter series, Splatoon. The online live-service game will get several free seasonal updates over the next year, adding new experiences, characters, maps, and more.




Besides being a quirky party game, Foamstars will be a strategic, multiplayer shooter where planning and teamwork are required to truly become the stars and emerge triumphant and squeaky clean. A few solo missions are also included in the game to help players get to know the six characters and how to best utilize their skills, although the focus of the game is ultimately on the multiplayer aspects. Whether playing casually with friends or looking to become the best at bathtime, Foamstars will certainly give a clean and colorful approach to shooter games.

Foamstars is a four versus four online party shooter game created by Square Enix exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles. Players will compete using guns that shoot soapy foam of specific colors depending on which team they are on and try to take out members of the opposite team and gain ground.
