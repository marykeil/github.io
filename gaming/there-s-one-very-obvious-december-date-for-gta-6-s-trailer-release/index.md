## Literature Review

A tweet from Rockstar confirming GTA 6&#39;s soon-to-be-released trailer has fans speculating just when they will get their first glimpse at the next GTA.




To call Grand Theft Auto 6 eagerly anticipated would be a monumental understatement. Fans of the franchise and GTA 6&#39;s predecessor, GTA 5, have had over a decade-long wait since the most recent release in the series. While a ton of release date leaks and rumors have proliferated on the internet for several years, a recent announcement by the game&#39;s developer, Rockstar Games, suggests the long wait may be approaching its end, and a specific date in December is very likely to bring a GTA 6 trailer.




GTA 5&#39;s popularity has endured through three console generations, due in no small part to the success of GTA Online, it&#39;s multiplayer component. Brand-new games from Rockstar are always cause for excitement, however, especially since development cycles have grown quite long, particularly for games as large and detailed as Grand Theft Auto. Perhaps the most notable event in the GTA 6 anticipatory saga was the leak of 90 gameplay videos, which inadvertently gave prospective players a look at the game long before it was ready. Now, though, it seems that an official reveal of the game is on the horizon.

                  GTA 6 News Coming &#34;As Soon As This Week,&#34; Reports Industry Insider [UPDATED]   Known industry insider and journalist Jason Schreier has reported that the wait for a GTA 6 announcement and trailer is - finally - nearly over.    


 Rockstar Announces GTA 6 Reveal 
GTA 6 Trailer Coming In Early December
          




Some preamble was given by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier via Twitter, who claimed, &#34;Rockstar plans to announce Grand Theft Auto VI as early as this week and will release a trailer in December.&#34; This was quickly followed by an official announcement from the Rockstar Games Twitter account, confirming the studio&#39;s intent to release a GTA 6 trailer &#34;in early December.&#34; This message came at the end of a thread of Tweets by the company, noting an upcoming anniversary.


 

Though Rockstar Games&#39; tweet was brief and ambiguous as to any details concerning the trailer&#39;s content, duration, or even its exact release date, this short and grateful message quickly became trending on Twitter. The excitement at the announcement sparked widespread speculation as to the exact date when fans can finally expect to see a sneak peek of what is in store for them in the next GTA game.






 GTA 6 Trailer May Release On Rockstar Games&#39; 25th Anniversary 
Expect The Trailer On Or Before December 10
         

This trailer confirmation message came at the end of a longer announcement which noted that December 10, 2023, will mark 25 years since the 1998 foundation of Rockstar. This early December anniversary date has quickly become an eagerly anticipated day online, with many fans predicting that Rockstar plans to launch the highly-anticipated game&#39;s first trailer on the anniversary of their formation.

While December 10, 2023, is an obvious choice for the trailer&#39;s release, The Game Awards are being held in early December, and would theoretically also be an excellent platform for the launch of the debuting trailer. Being held on December 7, 2023, The Game Awards are a prestigious annual gaming awards ceremony, and could therefore represent a great opportunity to show the gaming world the next game in Rockstar Games&#39; ever-popular franchise, Grand Theft Auto 6.
