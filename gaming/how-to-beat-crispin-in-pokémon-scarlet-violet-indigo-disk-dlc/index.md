## Literature Review

The first member of the Blueberry League Elite Four to beat is Crispin, a powerful Fire-type trainer in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.





Those looking to face Crispin must first complete his Elite Trial, which involves making a spicy sandwich in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. You have to gather different ingredients, including Onion, Chorizo, Mustard, Chili Sauce, and Jalapeño. Defeating trainers in the Trial will let you get other food items you can trade away for the materials you need, and let you make the sandwich with ease.






All the trainers in the Elite Trial reflect Crispin&#39;s affinity for Fire-type Pokémon, and are weak to Ground-type, Water-type, or Rock-type opponents as a result.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Gouging Fire (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC)   Gouging Fire is a new Legendary beast to find in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but it can be hard to catch this ancient form of Entei.   


 How to Defeat Elite Four Crispin in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC 
          

The best way to beat Crispin in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is to bring at least two Water-type, Ground-type, or Rock-type Pokémon, and one Fire-type Pokémon of your own that are all Level 75 or more. As you may expect, this Elite Four member has a clear weakness against certain typings, but there are some tricks they use to avoid this vulnerability. Crispin&#39;s team consists of:




 Pokémon  Type  Level  Ability  Item Held   Talonflame  Fire/Flying  77  Flame Body  Focus Sash   Rotom (Heat)  Fire/Electric  77  Levitate  Rocky Helmet   Exeggutor  Grass/Psychic  78  Harvest  Sitrus Berry   Camerupt  Fire/Ground  78  Solid Rock  Expert Belt   Magmortar  Fire  78  Flame Body  Passho Berry   Blaziken  Fire/Fighting  79  Speed Boost  Assault Vest   



A Rock-type Pokémon can knock out Talonflame with a powerful attack, but the Focus Sash item will prevent the fiery bird from being taken down instantly. Talonflame will always set up Sunny Day, which boosts the power of Fire-type attacks for the rest of Crispin&#39;s team. Furthermore, Sunny Day makes sure that Exeggutor&#39;s powerful Solar Beam attack doesn&#39;t take a turn to charge.

Anyone who brings a Ground-type Pokémon like Swampert from the Gen 3 starters in The Indigo Disk DLC may be surprised to see Rotom&#39;s Levitate ability preventing Ground-type moves from hitting it. Other abilities, like Flame Body on a couple of Crispin&#39;s Pokémon, can inflict Burn to any fighter that hits them with a physical attack. However, the real issue in this team is Crispin&#39;s ace, Blaziken.




                  Which Way You Should Fight The Elite Four In Pokémon Indigo Disk (&amp; Why)   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC has its own set of Elite Four challenges. Players can battle them in any order, but which one is best?   

Blaziken can Terastallize into the Fire-type, which gives the Pokémon even more strength for their attacks. The Speed Boost ability causes Blaziken&#39;s Speed to increase every turn, which can quickly outpace a wide variety of other Pokémon.

If you wish to beat Crispin in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, you have to bring a team that can work around every possibility seen by the Elite Four members&#39; Pokémon, and come ready with a plan.
