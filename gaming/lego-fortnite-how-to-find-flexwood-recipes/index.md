## Literature Review

Flexwood is a type of wood found in the Dry Valley of LEGO Fortnite. However, it comes from an unexpected source and can be hard to collect.





To take full advantage of Flexwood, you&#39;ll need a Lumber Mill at your disposal. Lumber Mills help turn various types of wood, like Knotroot and Flexwood, into Rods that are then used in more recipes. The more you upgrade your village, the more Rods you can make. Flexwood and Flexwood Rods are key upgrade resources in the later stages of building your village, making them even more important to harvest.




                  How To Get Knotroot In LEGO Fortnite   Knotroot is an essential mid-game crafting resource that can be found in caves in LEGO Fortnite. However, to harvest it, players need upgraded tools.   


 Finding &amp; Harvesting Flexwood 
          

While the name suggests that Flexwood could be harvested from a tree, that is not the case. Rather, Flexwood comes from cacti growing in the Dry Valley, aka the desert biome. The Dry Valley changes location in each playthrough, requiring some exploration to find. If you want to cut down cacti in LEGO Fortnite, you&#39;ll need the right tools. Cacti can only be chopped down by a Rare Forest Axe crafted from a twice-upgraded Crafting Bench.

The first upgrade for a Crafting Bench asks for 8 Planks and 3 Shells. Planks can be crafted from Wood with the Lumber Mill while Shells drop from rolling crabs that wander the Grasslands. The second Crafting Bench upgrade, meanwhile, asks for 12 Knotroot Rods, 15 Marble Slabs, 6 Sand Claws, and 3 Sand Shells. Knotroot Rods are crafted with the Lumber Mill and Marble Slabs come from a Stone Breaker after mining Marble. Sand Claws and Sand Shells are enemy drops from Sand Wolves and Sand Rollers, respectively, in the Dry Valley.




Once the Crafting Bench is upgraded, you&#39;ll need 5 Cut Amber and 3 Knotroot Rods. You can mine Rough Amber from amber deposits in the Dry Valley, which then gets processed in a Gem Cutter, turning it into Cut Amber. Once you have the needed resources, you can craft the Rare Forest Axe and chop down cacti for Flexwood.



If you want to quickly get some Flexwood, you can roll a large boulder into cacti to destroy them and reap their harvest.
