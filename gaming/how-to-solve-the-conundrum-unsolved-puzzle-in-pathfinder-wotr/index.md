## Literature Review

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&#39; Conundrum Unsolved puzzle is surprisingly simple to solve once you learn the trick behind inserting various slabs.





Slab puzzles in Pathfinder: WotR are nothing new, with the one in Conundrum Unsolved being similar to the others you may have encountered before. Before you can begin solving the puzzle, you have to collect slabs from urns in the room with the riddle. Gather as many items called &#34;Slab with Two White Symbols&#34; from around the area, but keep in mind that each symbol is unique with its own icon.

 Conundrum Unsolved Puzzle Solution 
          

To reach the Conundrum Unsolved puzzle solution, you have to place slabs with certain symbols with the Ancient Ghost on different slots along the room floor. The shapes of various slots only match with one type of slab along the floor&#39;s exterior and interior parts. You have to match slab symbols placed on the outer parts of the floor with corresponding spaces on the inner slots in Pathfinder: WotR.



An example of correct placement for this puzzle would be how the slots in the center-left and center-right spots of the main square must have slabs with symbols matching those placed on the exterior slots to the puzzle&#39;s left.







Take the first square slab and place it into the top slot of the puzzle, then put the other two square slabs in the open slots outside the inner square. Make sure to do this while facing the spider painting if you are confused about the right room orientation in Pathfinder: WotR. Next, use the middle-right slot to lay down another slab, then put the last slab in the slot furthest to the right in the puzzle.

This conversation reveals important information about the location and the Ghost&#39;s identity, with some experience being granted to you as a reward in Pathfinder: WotR.
