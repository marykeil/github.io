# Hidden Baldur s Gate 3 Side Quest Makes An Earlier Lose-Lose Decision A Lot Better


## SUMMARY 



  Side quests in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can be easily missed without quest markers or speaking to NPCs, resulting in small moments being overlooked, such as finding a home for a stray cat.   Exploring the Underdark in Act 1 can lead to encounters with Derryth and Baelen, apothecaries who need help retrieving Noblestalk. The party&#39;s choices can affect the outcome of this section, including whether Baelen dies.   If Baelen dies, Derryth can be found alone in Act 3 at Bonecloak&#39;s Apothecary, which can lead to a hidden quest and one of the game&#39;s few heartwarming endings.

## Literature Review

Act 1 gives you a side quest that feels like a loss no matter what, but you can fix this in Act 3 with the help of a feline friend in need of a home.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a lot of content tucked away that the player might not run into during a first playthrough, or even their first several playthroughs. This could be from taking different routes through the first acts, or from focusing on the main quests without looking for all the side quests that are scattered throughout the game. However, that can result in small moments being missed, such as finding a home for a stray cat.




It&#39;s easy to miss content in BG3 that isn&#39;t part of the main story when there aren&#39;t quest markers for side quests, and many of them require the party to speak with certain NPCs to begin. This is particularly true for content that starts in an earlier act, then continues in Baldur&#39;s Gate, where the city is large and quests aren&#39;t linear or always in obvious places. As a result, Tav can easily miss an apothecary side quest in Act 1, which then allows them to find a home for a stray cat that can keep a widow company.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Meeting Derryth &amp; Baelen Bonecloak 
Found In The Underdark
         




If Tav and the party decide to explore the Underdark at the end of Act 1 before heading into Act 2, there&#39;s a chance they&#39;ll come across Derryth and her husband Baelen. Baelen is stuck among mushrooms with explosive spores while trying to retrieve Noblestalk in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for Derryth, and he needs help from the party to escape. They work as apothecaries in Baldur&#39;s Gate and need Noblestalk for their shop, which is struggling with business, since Baelen used a lot of their money to fund his drinking habit.

Depending on what the party decides to do, there are several different endings to this section of Act 1. Noblestalk can be used to restore missing memories, so it can be given to Baelen to fix the condition that he ended up with after helping himself to the stock of the apothecary shop he owns, but it can also be given to Derryth for the shop, Shadowheart, or the Dark Urge to use. Giving the Noblestalk to Derryth, or keeping it for the party, results in them returning to their shop like normal, but giving it to Baelen returns him to his abusive self, and Derryth ends up leaving him.




However, there&#39;s a third option that might be the best choice for Derryth. If Baelen dies, Derryth returns to Baldur&#39;s Gate alone to run the apothecary. While she&#39;s lonely and misses her husband, it&#39;s a better situation than dealing with the original mean version of him, or the current version of him that&#39;s clueless and forgetful. Additionally, there&#39;s a way that the party can help alleviate that loneliness in Act 3 when they come across her again if they follow a certain series of steps.

Side Quest Only Available If Baelen Dies
          

After arriving at Baldur&#39;s Gate, the party can find Derryth again at Bonecloak&#39;s Apothecary in the Lower City as long as they don&#39;t give Baelen the Noblestalk, in which case she becomes inaccessible as an NPC, having left for an unknown location. If Baelen is alive and never used the Noblestalk, then both characters will be present at the shop, and there won&#39;t be much that the party is able to do aside from purchase from them. But if Derryth is alone, she&#39;ll mention that she misses her husband and believes that they both deserved a better life. She also says that she believes he&#39;ll be stuck in the City of Judgment forever because he was faithless in life.




                  The Funniest Content In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Is Hidden In An Act 3 Side Area   Some of the best Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 content is off the beaten path, and taking some diversions can lead to memorable gags and exciting encounters.   

After speaking with Derryth about her loneliness, the party has the chance to find her a companion in the form of a cat. And luckily, there are three cats near the apothecary who can be asked to keep Derryth company, but only one cat is actually a good fit and makes the perfect companion for her. However, speaking with each of them provides some interesting dialogue, and Tav can claim to be the mother of one, which then results in the cat referring to them as their mother in future interactions.



 The Cats Of Baldur&#39;s Gate 
Barsik, Myshka, &amp; Malta
          

The cats that are near Bonecloak&#39;s Apothecary are Barsik, Myshka, and Malta. Barsik and Myshka are found near Sorcerous Sundries. Barsik asks the party to pledge themselves to the feline goddess Sharess and help her crush the Absolute, and his response to accepting and declining are both rather positive. In one, he&#39;s thrilled that the party joins Sharess, and in the other, he respects their decision to deny her. Myshka, meanwhile, speaks a different feline dialect and is looking for his mother, asking if Tav holds that position. Tav can accept or mention that Derryth could be his mother.




                  One Foolhardy Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Decision Will Have Ogre Debt Collectors Knocking At Your Door   Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 includes a variety of consequences for immoral actions, and one choice can lead to ogre debt collectors coming after your party.   

While Myshka could make a decent companion for Derryth, Malta is the best choice. Malta is behind the Lower City Central Wall, behind the Central Watch Tower. When using speak with animals, Malta has a lot of dialogue about fate bringing the party to him, and that they&#39;d be united from that point on. However, the party can mention that Derryth is a better fit to be the fated partner he mentions, and that she&#39;ll give him all the scratches he wants. This has Malta say that perhaps his journey is meant to start with Derryth instead of Tav, and the party can then find him at Bonecloak&#39;s Apothecary.

Found After Sending Malta To Derryth
          




Malta can be spoken to again using speak with animals at the apothecary. Malta comments about seeing the person who got him off the streets and decided to take on the burden of justice without his help, and then he purrs. Since Malta now has a warm home, endless scratches, and consistent food, this is the perfect pairing because Derryth receives companionship in return. Myshka can fill this role, but speaking with Malta makes him the best choice, especially with the dialogue about fate making it seem like he&#39;s the intended companion for Derryth.

Not every character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gets a happy ending. In fact, it can feel like happy endings are few and far between depending on the choices that are made throughout all three acts. However, if the party is willing to look and explore all the content that&#39;s hidden within the acts, then it can lead to heartwarming moments like the companionship between Derryth and Malta in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
