## Literature Review

Although players are free to make choices throughout the game, one decision in particular determines which Hogwarts Legacy ending they receive.




Hogwarts Legacy has multiple endings, and the choices that affect these outcomes are arguably the greatest decisions in the game beyond settling on which Hogwarts House to choose. The ancient magic mystery that the fifth-year protagonist and Professor Fig have been trying to solve will finally come to a head, and it&#39;ll be up to them to navigate a particularly tricky situation. Their choice will directly influence the outcome of the game, so it&#39;s crucial that players are aware of which Hogwarts Legacy ending is best for them.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Hogwarts Legacy.]

Every student will have access to the three endings in Hogwarts Legacy, regardless of which decisions they make throughout the length of the title, since there&#39;s no in-game morality system. Indeed, even the darkest witches and wizards will have access to the good ending, and those that are morally sound will also have access to the evil ending. As such, players should feel free to approach character conversations, side quest choices, and other seemingly impactful actions, like asking for more money after quests, however they please - because only one decision ultimately dictates all Hogwarts Legacy endings.

 : Biggest Hogwarts Legacy Choices That Actually Matter


 Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Good Ending Explained 
          

Both the good and evil endings in Hogwarts Legacy take place below the school, as players are racing to the Repository underneath Hogwarts - where the ancient magic is held - in an attempt to get there before Ranrok can. They are accompanied in this scene by Professor Fig, and several other teachers make an appearance as well, fending off the school from the incoming goblin invasion. However, after a certain point, the protagonist is separated from everyone save for Fig as they make their way to the Repository. This is when the key choice will be made.




Professor Fig will tell the player that because of their power, they need to assume the role of Keeper over the reservoir, and he inquires what they&#39;ll do with the magic it holds. To get the good ending in Hogwarts Legacy, players will need to respond with &#34;I intend to keep it contained here,&#34; to which Fig will react positively. He&#39;ll follow this up by asking them how long they intend to keep ancient magic a secret, to which they&#39;ll need to reply with &#34;I shall keep it secret forever.&#34;

After this exchange, players will reach the Repository and come face to face with Ranrok. Following a brief confrontation, the goblin will absorb the Repository&#39;s power in full and transform into a dragon-like creature who serves as Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s final boss. The events that occur after this fight are where the game&#39;s endings differ. In Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s good ending, players will struggle alongside Professor Fig to contain the magic as the room crumbles around them. Eventually, they succeed and are able to seal away ancient magic for good.




 : Hogwarts Legacy’s Ancient Magic Makes No Sense

Unfortunately, the extreme exertion of helping the protagonist secure the ancient magic proves to be too much for Professor Fig, who peacefully passes away after one final conversation with the player. He tells them that his wife Miriam would have loved them, and that &#34;the wizarding world could not be in more capable hands.&#34; The scene concludes here, as do the story differences in Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s endings.



Professor Fig will, unfortunately, die no matter which ending players opt to get in Hogwarts Legacy.






 Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Evil Ending Explained 
          

However, those who choose the Dark Wizard path may want to get the evil ending in Hogwarts Legacy. Luckily, doing so takes minimal effort, as all players will need to do is give different, more ominous answers in their conversation with Professor Fig.




When he asks what the protagonist intends to do with the ancient magic, players should say &#34;I intend to open it,&#34; a response Fig will react to with concern. He warns the student against opening the Repository, and they&#39;ll get one last chance to get the good ending if they respond with, &#34;You&#39;re right.&#34; Otherwise, those set in their ways can get Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s evil ending by instead replying with &#34;This power should not be kept from the world&#34; or &#34;I want the power for myself.&#34;

When choosing the latter two options, there are some notable changes. The biggest difference is that players will fight Ranrok on their own, making the fight a bit more challenging. They will then proceed to absorb the ancient magic power from the Repository. As they do so, their eyes will glow red, which has some sinister implications. Unfortunately, taking advantage of the ancient magic in this way doesn&#39;t actually provide the student with any new spells or powers. Likewise, the extent of their newfound ancient magic mastery isn&#39;t explored whatsoever. Professor Fig doesn&#39;t appear in Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s evil ending either, leaving the circumstances of his death an unexplained mystery.






 Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s True Ending Explained 
          

Regardless of which Hogwarts Legacy ending they choose, after the fight with Ranrok concludes, players will return to Hogwarts. In the Great Hall, Professor Black and Professor Weasley each say a few words honoring Professor Fig. Depending on whether players turned in Sebastian Sallow or not during his side quests, this will be followed by a conversation with either Sebastian or Ominis Gaunt, where the player reveals that Victor Rookwood was actually responsible for cursing Anne. 

After this sequence, players will return to their common room, where they&#39;ll then be free to continue their adventures. They&#39;ll be reminded of their upcoming O.W.L. exams and any unfinished business they&#39;ve yet to complete around the map, and they&#39;ll also be assigned two new main quests: &#34;Weasley&#39;s Watchful Eye&#34; and &#34;The House Cup.&#34; The former, which entails a one-on-one final meeting with Professor Weasley, can be completed right away. However, the latter will require that the player completes the previous quest and reaches level 34.




Players who have already explored much of the Highlands and found Field Guide Pages will obviously be able to reach the level 34 threshold much more quickly. Those who need more levels, however, can do so easily by taking on enemies in the Battle Arenas or by finding Field Guide Pages. Side quests are another option, although this may take longer than just flying around and collecting the missing Field Guide Pages.



A complete guide to Field Guide Pages can be found here.




To get Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s true ending, players will need to complete both the &#34;Weasley&#39;s Watchful Eye&#34; and &#34;House Cup&#34; quests. Once they&#39;ve done so, a montage will play, depicting fellow students and the player completing their end-of-year assignments. This is followed by another Great Hall scene, which marks the end of the year and the House Cup ceremony. The player&#39;s House will be awarded extra points by Professor Weasley for bravery and determination they displayed during their term. Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s true ending concludes with their House celebrating their victory, and fireworks exploding across the screen.




No matter which route players decide to take - good or evil - this true ending will be the same. The professors will lament Fig&#39;s death, and the player&#39;s House always wins the House Cup. Teachers and students&#39; reactions are generally the same, and there&#39;s no real tease for a sequel. Even the evil route will ultimately lead to this bittersweet but overall happy ending.

In the end, there are only two endings in Hogwarts Legacy that truly change the story. The good ending sees Professor Fig and the protagonist lock away ancient magic forever, whereas the evil ending sees the student siphon the power for themselves. Neither of these outcomes are explored any further, but since Hogwarts Legacy looks like a trilogy, it&#39;s likely that they could be expanded upon in a potential sequel. The true ending is considered canon in the scope of the RPG, and it provides the most closure - but at the end of the day, it&#39;s up to the player to decide between all of Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s endings.
