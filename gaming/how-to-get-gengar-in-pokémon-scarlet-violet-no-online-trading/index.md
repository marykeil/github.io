## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet offer an opportunity to obtain Gengar in-game, a Pokémon which is normally received through trading with other players.





Haunter evolves into Gengar at any level when it is traded; however, you can get this Pokémon solo, but it still requires trading with an NPC. The Gen 1 Pokémon is not only an essential part of completing your Pokédex but also a great aggressive team member. Here&#39;s how you can get Gengar without trading online.




                  How To Catch All 400 Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet (Complete Pokédex)   Catching them all in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is no small challenge, with players having to catch and evolve 400 Pokemon species across Paldea.   


 Where To Find Gengar In Scarlet &amp; Violet 
Gengar&#39;s In-Game Trade Location 
          

To trade with an NPC in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you need to first head to Levincia&#39;s battle court. There, you will find an NPC named Blossom, who will ask to trade a Haunter with you in exchange for a Pincurchin.



If you do not have a Pincurchin in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you can catch one at various beaches in Paldea. You can grab a Pinchurchin just outside of Levincia&#39;s city limits.




Once your trade with Blossom is completed, the Haunter will immediately evolve into Gengar. This is because Blossom&#39;s Haunter isn&#39;t holding an Everstone, an item that prevents a Haunter from evolving.






 Traded Gengar Is Battle-Ready 
Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Best NPC Trade
          

As a Haunter, Hauntikins’ Ability is naturally Levitate, although it should be noted that Gengar has Cursed Body instead. This gives Gengar a chance to disable any damaging move that hits it.



Whether or not players allow it to evolve, Blossom’s Pokémon is level 25 at the time of trading and knows the moves Payback, Spite, Curse, and Hex. It also has Ghost as its Tera Type, which compliments its moveset.




This is one of only a few NPC trades in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and it offers the highest-level Pokémon. The somewhat unfortunate choice in nickname aside, it is clear that Hauntikins is ready to battle.

                  Every Scarlet &amp; Violet Version Exclusive In Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC doubles the number of version exclusives compared to The Teal Mask, and it&#39;s helpful to know the full list.   






 Why Gengar Should Be On Your Team 
A Worthy Addition To Your Pokémon Party
          

Gengar is one of the franchise&#39;s most popular Pokémon, often getting a spotlight in merchandise and Pokémon cards. Having been around since Gen 1, it&#39;s no surprise that Gengar is always a popular player choice for mainline games. There are lots of reasons to add Gengar to your line-up aside from its popularity though, as it is resistant to Bug and Poison attacks, immune to Normal and Fighting attacks, and has a high Special Attack (130).

Whether registering Gengar to join your team or to complete your Pokédex, this trade ensures that there is no need to attempt the long and sometimes risky process of the Pokémon games’ Surprise Trades. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players will always be able to obtain a Gengar.
