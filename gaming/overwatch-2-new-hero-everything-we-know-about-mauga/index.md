## Literature Review

Overwatch 2â€™s first Samoan hero, Mauga, is coming in Season 8 to have some fun while blowing things up with his weapons: Gunny and Cha-Cha.




Overwatch 2 is adding a new hero to its roster starting in Season 8, and this one has an extra dose of personality for players to enjoy. Mauga is a Samoan tank with a heavy backstory and powerful abilities. The announcement came during BlizzCon 2023 and Mauga was playable for that weekend only as a limited-time bonus trial run that was designed to go along with the event. Luckily, anyone who missed out doesn&#39;t have long to wait, as both Mauga and his guns are being added to the game permanently in just a few weeks.




Mauga is one of three heroes coming soon to Overwatch 2, with a new DPS hero named Venture and another Support hero being added to the game later on. Mauga&#39;s size and strength were augmented after he was wounded in a gunfight and operated on by an unknown party. He ended up as a member of Talon after the augmentation, where he formed a close relationship with Baptiste. He is a powerful tank with incendiary and volatile chain guns that make him extra dangerous to be up close and personal with.

                  A Deep Dive on New Brawler Tank Mauga with The Overwatch 2 Team   Members of the Overwatch 2 team discuss the game&#39;s 39th hero Mauga, a fiery tank brawler with a nasty new ult.

Many already suspected Mauga would be added to the playable lineup of the game after the recent addition of the Samoan map in Overwatch 2, particularly as he was originally said to be a character that developers had wanted to add to the original Overwatch. The announcement trailer for Mauga shows him trying to portray himself as a dumb, carefree, fun-loving guy, although his deadly combat skills and cunning mind prove that there is a lot of intelligence as well as darkness within. He hasn&#39;t had an easy life, and unfortunately, good therapy isn&#39;t a very common occurrence in the world of Overwatch.





 

In Mauga&#39;s backstory, he also has a very close relationship with Baptiste after the latter saved Mauga&#39;s life. Although some fans have hoped that the relationship between the two characters might be something stronger, according to a recent interview Screen Rant had with developers, it sounds as though that isn&#39;t happening.


Hero Producer Kenny Hudson: &#34;Right now they&#39;re just two really good friends and have a deep mutual respect for one another. And I think that&#39;s a good thing.&#34;


It may be that Mauga and Baptiste are simply friends, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t a great pair on the battlefield. Mauga&#39;s ferocious attacks and Baptiste&#39;s Support medic expertise can make them a force to be reckoned with.






 Mauga&#39;s Heavy-Assault Abilities Are Scary 
Guns Are Lovingly Named Gunny And Cha-Cha
         

Mauga may be visibly wielding two massive guns, but it is close-quarter combat that this Overwatch 2 tank excels at. He uses two strong chain guns: An incendiary weapon named &#34;Gunny&#34; which can set enemies on fire, and a volatile chain gun named &#34;Cha-Cha&#34; to finish them off. These combine with his passive Berserker ability that grants Mauga a temporary health increase when he deals critical damage. If his friends are getting low on health, Mauga can activate a Cardiac Overdrive ability that gives allies near Mauga the benefit of a 30% reduction in damage taken for 15 seconds while also allowing them to heal some by dealing damage.

As much of Mauga&#39;s attacks work best when used quickly in close range, he can trap himself and his enemies to keep everyone nice and close to him. This Cage Fight ability places a barrier and also grants Mauga unlimited ammo while the barrier is up to deftly take out his foes. The barrier works both ways, too, with anyone outside the barrier being unable to heal their teammates who may be trapped with a Berserking Mauga, and they cannot do damage through the barrier to Mauga either.




                  Overwatch 2 Review: Missing More Than An Extra Tank   New &amp; veteran players will have fun with Overwatch 2&#39;s well-polished free multiplayer, but Battle Pass grind &amp; lack of anticipated modes hold it back.    

Finally, Mauga also has a special Overrun ability that can be used to break through front lines and cannot be stopped by crowd control abilities. Unlike Reinhardt&#39;s charge, it doesn&#39;t draw enemies in but will instead provide some incredible knockback to send enemies flying and can help control the flow of movement in a fight. Combining Overrun with his other abilities can allow Mauga to place himself where he wants to be and trap everyone around him to do the most damage possible.



 Mauga Has Two Hearts 
One Cybernetic And One Organic
          

On Overwatch 2&#39;s website announcement of Mauga, it was briefly stated that &#34;he has Cardiac Overdrive to engage both of his hearts and create an aura that reduces incoming damage, allowing allies to heal themselves while dealing damage.&#34; One heart is the organic heart that he was born with, although slightly upgraded, while the other is an experimental cybernetic heart. This was installed during his cybernetic augmentations and is what provides Mauga with much of his power.

Releasing In Season 8
          

Mauga&#39;s official release in Overwatch 2 will take place when Season 8 begins on Tuesday, December 5, 2023. Mauga will then be able to be unlocked immediately with the purchase of a Season 8 Premium Battle Pass or can be unlocked upon reaching Tier 45 in the standard Battle Pass.

When Mauga makes his official debut in Overwatch 2, he is likely to be a popular character for anyone who likes to run and gun. His kit is specifically designed to jump right into the action and do as much damage as possible in close-quarter combat with some insanely monstrous chain guns that look like a blast to use. In Samoan, the name Mauga means Mountain and Overwatch 2&#39;s Mauga is certain to be a mountain on the battlefield.
