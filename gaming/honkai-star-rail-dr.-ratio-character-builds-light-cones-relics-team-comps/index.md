## Literature Review

You should optimize Dr. Ratio with a good build and strong team comp in Honkai: Star Rail to unlock his full potential as a 5-star DPS character.





If you do not have the 5-star version of Dan Heng, then Dr. Ratio is a fantastic substitute, especially because of how his gameplay is tailored toward melting HP bars. In addition to that, you can also get a copy of a free Dr. Ratio in Honkai: Star Rail until the end of Version 2.1, which makes him a fantastic present from the developers at HoYoverse. After you have successfully Ascended and leveled the character, you should start thinking about Dr. Ratio’s build, Light Cones, and team comps, as these will allow him to become even more powerful in combat.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Jingliu Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   To adequately use Jingliu as a main DPS in Honkai: Star Rail, you need to build her correctly and pair her up with the best team comps.   


 Best Light Cones For Dr. Ratio 
          

The best Light Cone for Dr. Ratio is his signature 5-star piece, called Baptism of Pure Thought. This item can only be obtained whenever it is featured in a limited run of the weapons banner. Baptism of Pure Thought Offers a decent base ATK (582 at level 80) but stands out due to its Superimposition ability. By equipping it, Dr. Ratio gets a 20% boost to CRIT DMG in Honkai: Star Rail. Additionally, with every debuff a target has, the user’s CRIT DMG against that same target will increase by 8%, up to three stacks, for a total of 24%.




Baptism of Pure Thought Offers also sees that, when Dr. Ratio uses his Ultimate to attack a target, he receives the Disputation effect, which increases the DMG dealt by 26% and enables his follow-up attacks to ignore 24% of the target’s DEF stat. This effect lasts for two turns. Baptism of Pure Thought Offers is built around Dr. Ratio’s kit, providing a high amount of extra damage output via CRIT DMG boosts and a bonus to his follow-up attacks in Honkai: Star Rail, which is extremely important.



These stats are considering the Light Cone at Superimposition level 0. The CRIT DMG bonuses and Disputation effect buffs are increased with every Superimposition level.




Having access to his signature Light Cone is not always a possibility, but there are viable 5-star substitutes for Dr. Ratio. Topaz’s weapon, called Worrisome, Blissful, is great for Dr. Ratio. It grants an 18% bonus to CRIT Rate and a 30% boost to follow-up attacks’ DMG. After Dr. Ratio uses a follow-up attack, they apply Tame to the target, up to two stacks. Whenever the Tamed target is hit by an ally, every Tame stack increases the CRIT DMG dealt by 12%. Though tailor-made for Topaz in Honkai: Star Rail, it also fits Dr. Ratio’s gameplay kit very well.




The table below lists the best build for Dr. Ratio, including Light Cone options, the best Relics and Ornaments, and his Skill Priority:

 Best Build For Dr. Ratio In Honkai: Star Rail   Light Cone    Baptism of Pure Thought (Best 5-star)   Worrisome, Blissful (Substitute 5-star)   Sleep Like the Dead (Substitute 5-star)   Cruising in the Stellar Sea (Substitute 5-star - F2P)   Swordplay (4-star option)   Return To Darkness (4-star option)      Relic &amp; Ornament Set  Relics:  Wastelander of Banditry Desert (4 pieces)    Ornaments:  Inert Salsotto (2 pieces)      Stat Priority    CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate   ATK   Imaginary DMG   SPD (optional)      Skill Priority    Talent   Skill &amp; Ultimate   Basic Attack      



Some other 5-star Light Cone substitutes for Dr. Ratio include Sleep Like The Dead and Cruising in the Stellar Sea – the second is a F2P (free-to-play) option. If no 5-stars are at your disposal, there are several 4-star Light Cones to pick from. Some of the best 4-star Light Cones for him are Swordplay and Return to Darkness. What you need to look out for when choosing a Light Cone for Dr. Ratio in Honkai: Star Rail are bonuses to CRIT DMG and CRIT Rate – and, if possible, buffs to follow-up attacks, since he relies heavily on them.






 Best Relics, Ornaments, &amp; Stats For Dr. Ratio 
          

When it comes to the gear you give the character, the best Relic set for Dr. Ratio is Wastelander of Banditry Desert. The two-piece bonus grants the user a 10% bonus to Imaginary DMG, which is fitting for his kit. The four-piece bonus sees that when he attacks debuffed enemies, his CRIT Rate is increased by 10%, while his CRIT DMG is boosted by 20% against Imprisoned enemies. These two effects combined make Wastelander of Banditry Desert the best Relic set for the character in Honkai: Star Rail.



Wastelander of Banditry Desert can be farmed at the Cavern of Corrosion: Path of Conflagration, located on the Stargazer Navalia map on the Xianzhou Luofu.




The best Planar Ornament set for Dr. Ratio is currently Inert Salsotto. While other sets can provide solid offensive bonuses, Inert Salsotto attends to most of Dr. Ratio’s needs. The two-piece bonus granted by the Ornament set increases the user’s CRIT Rate by 8% and, when their total CRIT Rate reaches 50% or higher, their Ultimate and follow-up attack DMG increases by 15%. The Inert Salsotto Ornament set in Honkai: Star Rail addresses Dr. Ratio’s requirements as a DPS and boosts the power of his strongest attacks.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Ruan Mei Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Ruan Mei&#39;s Weakness Break buffs make her a top-tier support unit in Honkai: Star Rail with plenty of strong options for Relics and Light Cones.   

When farming these Relics and Ornaments, the stats you will want to look after for Dr. Ratio are a good 2:1 balance of CRIT DMG and CRIT Rate – aiming for at least 70% CRIT Rate and 140% CRIT DMG should be a good distribution. The secondary stats for him are ATK, Imaginary DMG, and SPD. You will likely also get some other sub-stats in your gear. Break Effect and HP are nice to have, even if they are not the priorities when farming for Dr. Ratio.



 Best Team Comps For Dr. Ratio 
         

As a DPS, Dr. Ratio’s team comp in Honkai: Star Rail is built around him and his abilities. He thrives on dealing damage with his Ultimate and follow-up attacks and requires a debuffer to reach the peak of his potential. The debuffer is the most important piece of the team comp for Dr. Ratio, and Silver Wolf is one of the best ones around. She can implant new weaknesses on enemies, while also activating the bonuses Dr. Ratio can have when attacking debuffed targets. Alternatively, you can use characters like Welt, Asta, or Pela.




In a traditional team comp, you will also need a support unit and a healer. The support is encouraged to be a buffer. Ruan Mei, Tingyun, and Yukong are the best options around, as they will increase Dr. Ratio’s offensive properties. When it comes to healers, you can choose between Luocha and Huohuo. Both are capable of dispelling debuffs, which is important in late-game content. The main difference is that Huohuo can provide extra buffs, while Luocha can trigger an auto-heal effect in Honkai: Star Rail.

The table below lists some examples of team comps for Dr. Ratio:

 Best Team Comps For Dr. Ratio In Honkai: Star Rail   Regular Team Structure    Dr. Ratio (Physical - Hunt)   Silver Wolf (Quantum - Nihility), Topaz &amp; Numby (Fire - Hunt), or Welt (Imaginary - Nihility)   Ruan Mei (Ice - Harmony) or Tingyun (Lightning - Harmony)   Huohuo (Wind - Abundance) or Luocha (Imaginary - Abundance)      Mono Imaginary Team    Dr. Ratio (Physical - Hunt)   Silver Wolf (Quantum - Nihility) or Welt (Imaginary - Nihility)   Yukong (Imaginary - Harmony)   Luocha (Imaginary - Abundance)      



Despite the examples, you are free to experiment and innovate. The important thing when building a party around Dr. Ratio is providing at least one character capable of applying debuffs on enemies, while another ensures his survival through tough fights. Instead of a buffer, you can also play around with a sub-DPS unit for increased damage output and, depending on who you pick, use that sub-DPS as a debuffer – this is the case with units such as Welt and Guinaifen in Honkai: Star Rail.






 Skill Priority For Dr. Ratio 
          

When you are leveling up the Traces in Dr. Ratio’s skill tree, you should consider prioritizing a few over others. This is especially true when considering the sheer amount of materials and Credits needed. The most important Trace to level up is his Talent, as that is the one related to his follow-up attacks and where most of his damage comes from. Following that, you should also boost Dr. Ratio’s Ultimate and Skill, as these are vital to his rotation in battle.

                  Honkai: Star Rail - Huohuo Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Huohuo is a powerful healer in Honkai: Star Rail who is capable of also acting as a stat booster for her team comp. Here are her best builds.   

You should only use his Basic Attack whenever you are out of Skill Points, so that should be your last priority. Building Dr. Ratio is not too hard as his gameplay kit is very straightforward. Other than his follow-up attacks and bonuses when attacking debuffed foes, there are no special mechanics like HP-loss buffs, so it is easier to reach the desired goals with him. Using a well-built Dr. Ratio in Honkai: Star Rail can significantly improve your experience with the game, as he is currently one of the best DPS around – and a free one at that.
