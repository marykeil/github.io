## Literature Review

The Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: Paldean Fates set will include 240 cards with more than 100 of them being shiny and all new Pokémon ex varieties.




The Pokémon Trading Card Game is not slowing down any with its releases of new expansion sets to Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet, and this next one may be the most popular yet. The Paldean Fates set will kick off the TCG&#39;s 2024 lineup with 240 cards, over 100 of which will feature shiny and new Pokémon ex variations. A comparable set has already debuted in Japan with the name Shiny Treasure ex although the full card lists for the two will not be identical. While, at the time of writing, there has not yet been a full reveal of which cards will carry over to Paldean Fates, there are many that are expected to.
Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates is scheduled to be released on January 26, 2024, and numerous special sets for the expansion, including a Sticker Collection, will follow a month later in February. The sets will include many of the popular Pokémon characters in shiny variations, including many that are new to the Paldea region, such as the video game starters of Scarlet and Violet, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. Shiny hunting for Pokémon is always a fun pastime, and now it will extend to the TCG thanks to the shiny cards coming with Paldean Fates.
            
 
 Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates - Release Date, New Cards, &amp; Special Sets Info 
Paldean Fates, the first Pokémon TCG expansion of 2024 has been revealed, along with its release date, new cards to expect, and special sets.












 








 10  Shiny Quaxly 
Water-Type Pokémon


 







Each of the shiny cards for the beloved Pokémon Scarlet and Violet starters are expected to be highly sought after because of the simple fact that these are such cheerful and well-loved creatures. The shiny variant of Quaxly is the least obvious for its differences between shiny and normal, however, with just the slightest color change in its hair and feet. If not for the unique background that the shiny cards in Paldean Fates feature, it would be easy to simply pass over this card without even realizing it is different.





 9  Shiny Sprigatito 
Grass-Type Pokémon


 







Similar to the above-mentioned Quaxly, Sprigatito is a fan-favorite with its adorable cat-like characteristics, but its shiny version is disappointing. The playful pose it takes on the card makes it even cuter, yet does little to highlight the subtle color change that should be its largest focus. The card itself does not have any notable moves that would set it apart as something magnificent to play either. Still, having a shiny Sprigatito in a collection of Paldean Fates is a must for any collector or player, and will be one to chase, if for no other reason than that it is Sprigatito.
            
 
 Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Starters: Is Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Or Quaxly Best 
Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet offers players a slate of eclectic new starters, but the question is whether one stands out over the other two choices.








 8  Shiny Tinkaton 
Fairy/Steel-Type Pokémon
        

The actual Pokémon character of Tinkaton does not appear to look any different at all in its shiny form, except for the hammer it holds. Throughout its evolution from Tinkatink and Tinkatuff to, finally, the strongest form of Tinkaton, the little pink creature is the same as it is when not shiny. The hammer it holds, which grows in size with each evolution, is a more colorful version when shiny, being bronze and magenta rather than its traditional silver and purple.
            
 
 Everything Included In The Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates Elite Trainer Box 
The Paldean Fates Elite Trainer Box has a number of key inclusions to make it easy to jump into the next expansion of the Pokémon Trading Card Game.








 7  Shiny Fuecoco 
Fire-Type Pokémon


 







Compared to its fellow Pokémon Scarlet and Violet starter pals, Fuecoco is at least a bit more obvious in its shiny form, although still not by much. The main skin of the Fire-type friend is more of a pink color than the red it normally is. Again, given that Fuecoco is one of the most familiar faces of the Paldea generation, the shiny form card for Fuecoco will be one that many will want to have in their collection or deck, simply to have it.





 6  Shiny Quaquaval ex 
Water-Type Pokémon
        

Each of the Scarlet and Violet starters have final evolved forms that can become the more powerful ex cards in the Pokémon TCG, and in Paldean Fates, these include shiny versions as well. The full-art shiny pose of Quaquaval ex is a vibrant show that works well with the nature of this peacock-like character and is beautiful against the shiny card backdrop.





 5  Shiny Greavard 
Psychic-Type Pokémon
        

It is difficult not to smile when seeing any of the cheerful canine forms of Pokémon, including the ghostly Greavard. Its shiny form looks much less like a ghost and more like a real, living, dog with the golden color that its fur becomes versus the silver that it traditionally appears as. This beautiful design for Greavard&#39;s shiny card in Paldean Fates is adorable and can be incredibly useful as well, with an attack that does ten damage for each Psychic-type Pokémon in the character&#39;s discard pile.





 4  Shiny Dondozo 
Water-Type Pokémon
        

One of the best examples of a shiny variation being truly different in appearance from its traditional form is the Water-type Dondozo. Usually, Dondozo features a combination of light and dark blue, but as a shiny it becomes yellow and white. The Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates card can do a powerful Heavy Splash move that does 120 damage, and looks good while doing it.





 3  Shiny Gardevoir Ex 
Psychic-Type Pokémon
        

Very few of the Shiny Illustration Rare cards for Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates have been shown yet, and it still has not been verified yet if Gardevoir ex&#39;s shiny form will appear in the English sets. It has been confirmed that the set will feature Shiny Illustration Rare cards, however, and it is likely that Gardevoire ex will be included due to its frequency of appearance in references to Paldean Fates. This stunning card captures Gardevoir ex&#39;s beauty, and if it is available in the English Pokémon TCG sets, it will be highly sought after.





 2  Pawmi Special Illustration Rare 
Electric-Type Pokémon
        

Another unconfirmed, but likely, card for the Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates set is the Special Illustration Rare edition of Pawmi. This vivid card shows several of the cuddly Electric-type creatures sleeping, and right in the middle of the huddled friends is a beautiful pink shiny Pawmi. The mixture of shiny and non-shiny Pokémon in the artwork for one card is a fun move that would be nice to have shown in future cards as well.





 1  Shiny Tera Charizard Ex 
Dark-Type Pokmeon
        

In any form, Charizard is regularly a powerful and desirable card, and the Paldean Fates set may just have one of the best examples to collect. This black shiny form of Charizard is combined with also being a Tera-type ex card. This Shiny Illustration Rare Tera Charizard ex is a strong card for anyone who would bring it to a table, but is also likely to be one of the most hunted cards for this Pokémon TCG set.
