## Literature Review

The Indigo Disk is the last DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, but you&#39;ll need to play through a lot of content before you can go to Blueberry Academy.





Like many DLCs, you cannot play The Indigo Mask as soon as you start a new game. To travel to Blueberry Academy, you&#39;ll need to put in a lot of time and effort into training your team and exploring Paldea. If you&#39;re an experienced trainer, starting The Indigo Disk should be easy for you.





 The Indigo Disk DLC Requirements 
          

There are two main requirements to unlock The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. The first involves completing the main story of the base game. One of the reasons fans like Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is that the main story is not a single linear plotline. Instead, the main plot consists of three different paths that can be tackled in any order. You must complete all three quest lines to finish the main story and unlock the new DLC.

Path One, the Path of Legends, involves hunting down Titan Pokémon found throughout Paldea. You&#39;ll have to fight these giant Pokémon to unlock new abilities for Koraidon/Miraidon. Each one is much stronger than the one before, which means you&#39;ll have to strengthen your team and raise your level before going onto a new Titan Pokémon. You&#39;ll want to fight these Titan Pokémon from weakest to strongest, starting with the Stony Cliff Titan, Klawf.




Path Two is called Victory Road. This is the traditional Pokémon plot where you challenge a series of gym leaders and rise in the ranks of the Pokémon League. Each gym requires you to complete a Gym Test before you can prove yourself worthy of fighting the Gym Leader and getting your badge. Cortondo Gym, the Bug-type gym led by Katy, is the best gym to start with. Once you beat all eight gyms, you&#39;ll fight in the Pokémon League and eventually battle your rival/friend Nemona.

The last path, Starfall Street, sends you out to battle Team Star, a group of delinquents with bases throughout Paldea. These bases are organized into crews centered around specific Pokémon types; Dark, Poison, Fire, Fairy, and Fighting. Just as you can&#39;t fight the gym leader immediately, if you want to fight the Team Star crew leader, you&#39;ll have to survive a Star Barrage. This involves defeating a horde of Pokémon in a short amount of time with a limited team. If you start with the Dark Crew and progress through the types as listed, you should be fine.




                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: Every Team Star Boss, Ranked   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet introduced the new Team Star opponents, and they pose a threat to players. Here they are, ranked from easiest to hardest.   

Once you complete all three story paths, you can play the last main story quests in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet and complete the base game. When that&#39;s done, you can move on to the second main requirement for unlocking The Indigo Disk; beating The Teal Mask. This DLC is a far more linear adventure in the land of Kitakami. You can journey to Kitakami as soon as you complete the tutorial missions and start on the three story paths in the main game.



 Preparing For &amp; Starting The Indigo Disk 
          

Once you have the main story and The Teal Mask under your belt, you&#39;ll want to make sure your team is ready for the challenges you&#39;ll face at Blueberry Academy. The trainers at Blueberry Academy have high-level Pokémon, so you need a high-level team to face those challenges. When choosing Pokémon for your Blueberry Academy team, make sure they work well in Double Battles, as most of the trainers in the Terrarium will challenge you to a Double Battle.






Some of the best Pokémon available for Double Battles include Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Iron Hands, and Meowscarada, although the effectiveness of each of these Pokémon is dependent on who you partner them with.




You&#39;ll also need a lot of resources if you want to catch Generation 1 Starter Pokémon or others found in the biomes of the Terrarium. Some of your most important resources include Pokéballs, EXP Candies, Herba Mystica, and healing items. If you&#39;re hunting for Shiny Pokémon or other special Pokémon​​​​​​​, you may want to bring along a Pokémon​​​​​​​ dedicated to catching new teammates. Finally, try to complete your Pokédex for both Paldea and Kitakami before you head to Blueberry Academy.

If you&#39;ve finished all your preparations and feel ready to head into the Terrarium, you&#39;ll need to head to Naranja/Uva Academy after getting a call from Clavell about an exchange trip. Head to the main lobby of the Academy, where you&#39;ll witness a cutscene with Cyrano.




​​​​​​​Speak to Cyrano when you&#39;re ready to head to Blueberry Academy. The reason you need to prepare is that you won&#39;t be able to go back to Paldea or Kitakami until you complete some of the main story in The Indigo Disk.

                  Every New Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, Ranked   The new Pokémon in The Indigo Disk DLC are generally strong, but some come out ahead of others when all attributes are taken into consideration.   

If you need to leave Blueberry Academy for any reason later on in your playthrough, simply access your map and click over to the Paldea regional map. With that, you&#39;re ready to face whatever The Indigo Disk has to throw at you in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet
