## Literature Review

Star Ocean The Second Story R allows you to recruit six extra party members. This affects combat, side stories, and the ending.





Both main characters Claude Kenny and Rena Lanford are mandatory party members, though you can pick who to control - this is similar to the choice of Raymond and Laeticia. This leaves six free slots to recruit other options.






After reaching this limit no one else can join. You will need to wait and unlock New Game Plus mode to try out someone new.





 Character Recruitment Requirements 
          

You can have a total of eight party members. Four will be in the active combat party, but for the remake, the other four can be summoned into battle as a form of quick-hit strikers. Because Claude is always a strong fighter and Rena a suitable healer, you don’t want too much overlap or redundancies when picking teammates.

 Character  Role  Recruitment Method  Important Notes   Claude Kenny  Power Melee Fighter  One of the main characters. Always joins after either tutorial section.  Loses his Phase Gun Special Art after the tutorial.   Rena Lanford  Healer  The other main character. Will join shortly after the beginning of the game.  Rena is the only character to learn Raise Dead.   Celine Jules  Caster  A temporary character that helps out in Krosse Cave. She will ask to permanently join upon leaving.  If she is rejected, she returns as a Guest party member when Claude is the main character.   Opera Vectra  Ranged Fighter  Find Ernest during the first visit to Krosse. Then, once reaching Hilton talk to Opera in the bar. Go to Krosse Mountain Palace’s dungeon, and she will ask to join part way through.  Cannot be on the same team as Ashton. Alternate selections can be made after completing the game once. Opera has some healing abilities.   Ashton Anchors  Power Melee Fighter  Go to the Hilton’s docks and hear about the rumor of dragons inside Salva Mines. Go into the mines and rescue Ashton in the final room.  Cannot be on the same team as Opera or Ernest.   Welch Vineyard  Combo Melee Fighter  After the tournament in Lacuer concludes, enter Private Action mode. Go to the castle and meet with Welch. Complete the whole scene here and she will ask to join.  It is unclear if Welch has arrived before or after her scenes in Star Ocean: The Divine Force. Welch has very little story interactions, only speaking during Private Actions. Requires also recruiting Precis to learn all Special Arts.   Precis Neumann  Ranged Fighter  Travel to Linga and start Private Action mode. Claude and Rena will have different events around town involving the Neumann family. Rena will meet Graft at his house, while Claude finds Precis in the streets near the item shop. Complete the respective scene, and Precis will offer to join.  Cannot be on the same team as Bowman. Requires also recruiting Ashton to learn all Special Arts.   Bowman Jeane  Combo Melee Fighter  After finding herbs in the Sanctuary of Linga, spend the night at the Jeane family home. If Precis is not in the party, Bowman will ask to join.  Cannot be on the same team as Precis.   Ernest Raviede  Power Melee Fighter  After recruiting Opera, finish the entirety of the Krosse Mountain Palace to find Ernest’s hideaway. Travel back to Arlia and find Ernest’s ship in the forest. When completing the story of Hoffman Ruins, Ernest will attack. Defeat the demons possessing him and he will offer to join.  Cannot be on the same team as Ashton. Optionally, Opera can leave the party with Ernest.   Dias Flac  Combo Melee Fighter  When playing as Rena, Dias will ask to join Lacuer Front Lines.  Cannot be on the same team as Leon. Will sometimes appear as a Guest if Rena is the main character.   Leon Gehste  Caster  He will join us as a Guest during Hoffman Ruins. If playing as Claude, the two will become shipwrecked at Eluria. Speak to the elder at the colony and decide whether to leave Leon in his care or recruit the young boy.  Cannot be on the same team as Dias.   Chisato Madison  Combo Melee Fighter  Find Chisato wandering around near the government building in Centroplis of Nede. Find her ID card in the Cave of Crimson Crystals. Return it to her at Centroplis and she will join up.  Cannot be recruited if all eight party spaces are full.   Noel Chandler  Healer  After the story events at Cave of Crimson Crystals, he will offer to join if you have seven or fewer party members.  Cannot be recruited if all eight party spaces are full.   






With so many options, it will be a careful decision on who to take in Star Ocean The Second Story R. Completionists may want to have Welch, Precis, and Ashton together to earn all of their attacks. Having a unique mix can lead to special Private actions, and the Star Ocean series staple of many endings. But this incentivizes playing the game multiple times with different teams.
