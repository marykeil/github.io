## Literature Review

Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s latest expansion, A Rift In Time, reboots the game&#39;s never-ending treasure hunt with the search for scorpions.





If you&#39;re looking to fill your belly or make some change, scorpions can be sold for 425 or consumed to restore 900 energy. There are, however, better ways to restore a lot of energy or make money in Disney Dreamlight Valley. In that case, the only other reason you&#39;d be on the hunt for scorpions is part of a quest to unlock Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, one of three new characters added alongside the A Rift In Time DLC.

 How to Get Scorpions In Disney Dreamlight Valley 
          

Scorpions are a new ingredient exclusive to the A Rift In Time expansion and can only be found on Eternity Isle in the Glittering Dunes biome. They are not, however, found roaming the biome. Instead, you must fish for scorpions in the biome&#39;s darker sandy patches, which you can see on your mini-map. In these sandy water areas, you&#39;re specifically looking for blue and orange fishing pools with sand-filled bubbles rising from them. Although other fish can be caught in these pools, this is the only way to catch scorpions in Disney Dreamlight Valley.






You&#39;ll need to have already unlocked the fishing rod from the original game before you can fish throughout Eternity Isles.




Gaston&#39;s Scorpion Quest
When you first visit the Glittering Dunes, you&#39;ll come across a stranded Gaston. If you speak to him, he&#39;ll ask you to get him a &#34;Flexing Spider-Like Thing?&#34; to eat; he&#39;s referring to a scorpion. One of the darker sandy fishing pools is right next to his location. Simply wait for blue and orange pools to appear and fish in them to catch a scorpion. So, while you can&#39;t just stumble across scorpions in the Glittering Dunes, catching them is no more difficult than catching any of the other fish in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
