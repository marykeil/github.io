## Literature Review

The winner of Game of the Year award at TGA 2023 (The Game Awards) has finally been revealed and it comes as no surprise considering its merits.




The Game of the Year award at The Game Awards (TGA) 2023, abbreviated as the GOTY, has finally been revealed. The largest and most important game awards celebration was held this Thursday, December 7, and was the stage for the announcement of the winners of the best games and names from the current per category. Such categories include disputes such as Best RPG, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and much more. The biggest award, however, is the GOTY, as it nominates the title that is considered the absolute best during the year.




After a few hours of presentation, The Game Awards 2023&#39;s livestream came to an end after announcing that Baldur’s Gate 3 won the Game of the Year award. Having been declared the GOTY, this title was the most adored by the chosen jury and the public that voted – and it just so lines up with Screen Rant’s own prediction of the GOTY at TGA 2023. This was not too much of surprise when considering how impactful Larian Studios’ RPG was at launch.


 

The game made a lot of ripples in the industry with its branching narrative story and a huge amount of freedom when navigating through the campaign while making decisions. Baldur’s Gate 3 even initiated a widespread and controversial discussion on whether or not it should be considered the new standard for games of the same genre. The victory was celebrated by the developer on the official Larian Studios account on X.





 2023 Was A Competitive Year For The GOTY Award 
          

Even though the announcement that Baldur’s Gate 3 won the GOTY was not too surprising, the award did have fierce competition this year with several strong nominations for The Game Awards 2023. Disputing the category were Baldur’s Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Resident Evil 4, and Super Mario Bros. Wonder. All six titles were received to critical acclaim and instant infatuation by the public. For further reference, the table below lists all of the games’ scores on Screen Rant and Metacritic:

 All GOTY Nominees   Game  Review Score  Metascore     Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 [Winner]     Screen Rant: 4.5/5  Metacritic: 96     Alan Wake 2     Screen Rant: 5/5  Metacritic: 88     The Legend of Zelda: Tears Of the Kingdom     Screen Rant: 5/5  Metacritic: 96     Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2     Screen Rant: 5/5  Metacritic: 90     Resident Evil 4     Screen Rant: 4/5  Metacritic: 93     Super Mario Bros. Wonder     Screen Rant: 4.5/5  Metacritic: 92   






Although the competition was intense, especially between titles like Baldur’s Gate 3, Alan Wake, and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Larian Studios’ RPG came out on top. The game is truly worthy of its newfound award, as it presents an intricate and well-developed gameplay system that walks hand-in-hand with a carefully woven story. The amount of freedom offered by the game, both in terms of combat and narrative, is outstanding and very different from many titles in its genre.

Baldur’s Gate 3 does resemble other CRPG titles, such as Larian Studios’ own Divinity: Original Sin 2. However, it includes full cutscenes with a detailed approach to characters’ facial and body expressions, making immersion much deeper and more detailed. The GOTY award delivered to Baldur’s Gate 3 at The Game Awards is a recognition of its merits and an acknowledgment of how good a game it is.
