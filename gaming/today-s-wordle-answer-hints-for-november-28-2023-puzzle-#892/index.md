The November 28th Wordle answer is SCOPE.




We had a very simple time with today&#39;s Wordle and got very lucky. For our starting word we used POUND which provided two misplaced letters with &#39;P&#39; and &#39;O&#39;. Mixing them up and moving forward we tried CHOPS as our second attempt.

This really solidified a good group of letters giving us the correct spots for &#39;O&#39; and &#39;P&#39; as well as two more misplaced letters with &#39;C&#39; and &#39;S&#39;. Just a simple shuffling of letters led us to our win-in-three with the correct answer, SCOPE. Another Wordle word solved and another notch on the win-streak.
