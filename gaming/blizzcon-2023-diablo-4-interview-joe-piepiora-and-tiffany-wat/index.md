## Literature Review

Two of the biggest names behind Diablo 4 discuss what is coming up with the Vessel of Hatred expansion, Abattoir of Zir, Midwinter Blight, &amp; Season 3.





In between the opening event and Campfire Chat, two of the lead developers sat down to talk a little with Screen Rant regarding what is coming in Diablo 4&#39;s future. Production Director, Tiffany Wat, and Associate Game Director, Joe Piepiora were gracious enough to discuss some of the hot topics, such as the upcoming Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred expansion and content that is just around the corner for Season 2 and the holiday Midwinter Blight.




                  Every Major Change In Diablo 4 Season 2 from D4 Season 1   Season 2 of Diablo 4 brings more than just the Season of Blood, there are also numerous quality-of-life improvements happening for the entire game.   


 Diablo 4 Vessel Of Hatred 
The First Expansion
          

Screen Rant: Is it true that Diablo 4 is going to be probably having annual expansions from this point?


Tiffany Wat: &#34;We have nothing to announce in terms of our future plans with other expansions of Diablo 4 but super excited to be able to share obviously that Vessel of Hatred will be coming late next year. Which, I think to be able to announce an expansion within the first five and a half months of launch is super exciting. I feel like maybe some people were anticipating it but I think it really took the crowd by surprise which was really great.&#34;






 

Screen Rant: What kinds of things can people expect from this expansion that will be different from the regular Seasons that you are having?


Tiffany Wat: &#34;So, the expansion will have a new region for players to explore. Diablo 4 shipped with five contiguous unique regions and so we will be building and expanding upon the world of Sanctuary and visiting a fan-favorite region that was featured in Diablo 2 and that is Nahantu.
And then we will be featuring a brand-new class, never before seen in the Diablo universe, which is really, really exciting. I think, obviously, we love to honor and embrace the legacy of our past Diablo classes and we did so with the launch and our incredible lineup, but I think being able to develop and bring a brand-new class to the community is going to be very exciting.





Screen Rant: Can you give us any hints on what the class will be? If it’s melee or magic?


Tiffany Wat: (laughing) &#34;You’ll just have to wait until we share more details next year! But it’s been really fun to see the speculation and the excitement that the community has.&#34;


Screen Rant: I’m assuming this will be a paid expansion. Are you at liberty to give any idea on how much it is probably going to cost?


Tiffany Wat: We don’t have any details to share on pricing but you are correct that it will be a paid expansion. We will continue to be releasing Seasonal content and players will have the opportunity to engage in the Seasonal content whether they end up purchasing the expansion or not.




 Season Two Changes And The Abattoir Of Zir 
Seasonal Endgame Dungeon
          

Screen Rant: Getting back to more current stuff, with Seasons and everything, the class-specific malignant rings were announced. What can you tell us about those and are players who did not play Season of Malignant going to still get any benefit from these?





Joe Piepiora: &#34;Absolutely. So a patch that is coming out next week, next Tuesday, is releasing the five new unique rings that are going to begin to drop in Diablo 4. They will initially be available on Seasons and eventually we will be able to get them on the Eternal Realm as well. They are not tied to anything you have done in Season 1, in the Season of the Malignant. These are now current and eternal items from this point forward for players to be able to use as they like.
So if there’s a, you know, we picked one of the more popular powers for each of the classes that we had from Season 1, and now you have to choose if you want it. If you want to get that power back again, like if you’re a necromancer, and you want to be able to auto-explode your corpses and have corpse sentinels go flying out of them, if you want to have that capacity once again that you had in Season 1, you’ll need to sacrifice a valuable ring slot in order to use that. You’ll have to get that unique ring in order to do it.
We think it will be a really exciting addition to the game and shows how we want to continue to imagine how to reuse some of the things we used in past seasons and have them return in interesting and compelling ways. Really, after we’ve gotten some feedback about them, and we know what players are really gravitating towards, it helps us to continue to refine and make a cooler game overall for the players.&#34;







Malignant Rings are available in Diablo 4 now.




Screen Rant: The Abattoir of Zir. I understand it is a six-week season event within the season that is starting on December 5. What can you tell us about this?


Joe Piepiora: So players in the Season of Blood that are rocking vampiric powers, they are going to target farm specific uniques they want from the various new endgame bosses we have added to Diablo 4, or they are crashing and crushing through blood harvest areas, they are getting really strong. Very, very powerful. And, now they are at a point where they have finished a lot of the nightmare dungeons, they have done a lot of these things, and now the question is like, ‘I’ve gotten all this power, what do I do with it? What’s the next thing for me to go after? Not Uber Lilith, but what is the next thing, the next challenge to go after’.
The Abattoir of Zir is here to provide. So, for players who have done all this most challenging content that we have in the game so far, The Abattoir of Zir is now a new pinnacle dungeon experience for players to begin to engage with. It is a 25-level new dungeon type that players will be able to go in and experience. The first tier of this dungeon is harder than a tier 100 nightmare dungeon. It already is more difficult than all of the most difficult dungeon content that we have in the game. And it gets only progressively harder and harder and harder the further and further players try to progress into this dungeon.
So, players will be able to go in, test their really powerful builds, whether its like a vault lightning build or a sixteen point rogue build or whatever it is that you’re rocking in the season and feeling really strong with, now you have a place to go and really try to show off and see how far you can really get. So, one of the new things we are adding also, alongside the introduction of the Abattoir of Zir, is we are adding a new glyph. A new kind of glyph for players to collect, that will be available for the season only. It’s called the Tears of Blood glyph.
The Tears of Blood is a 200-tier paragon glyph for players to get. Now, typical paragon glyphs in Diablo 4 have 21 tiers associated with them where you can level them up over the course of that time. The Tears of Blood glyph goes much further than that. It requires a lot of glyph xp in order to level up and provides a lot of power to players who invest in it and decide to put it in their paragon board, and it’s going to be a really essential tool for them to lean on as they go deeper and deeper into the Abattoir of Zir cause those monsters are going to get tougher and tougher. You’re going to need that extra ability and that extra damage in order to try to make it through.
That’s the quick look. It’s going to be running for the six weeks. It’s very, very challenging. When players go into the space they are basically racing a timer. They have to beat the timer and manage to summon the boss before the end. In that way, it’s very similar to rifts from Diablo 3, and it’s purely about slaughtering the creatures inside. No loot is going to drop during the run, you can pick all of it up at the end. And if you die, the run is over. So you have to be very careful as you go through the experience.





Screen Rant: After the six weeks are over, does the glyph and anything that helps with doing the run through the Abattoir of Zir, do you get to keep any of that? Or will that go away at the end of the six weeks?


Joe Piepiora: &#34;Those will go away at the end of the Season. The end of the six week seasonal event is going to be colliding with the end of the Season in general. So at that point we will be talking about what the next season is going to hold and what new mysteries and discoveries will be there for players to go after, but the Tears of Blood glyph and the Abattoir of Zir will both be gone.&#34;




 Diablo 4&#39;s Midwinter Blight Begins 
Holiday Event
          

Screen Rant: And then Midwinter Blight begins...


Tiffany Wat: &#34;The Abattoir of Zir begins on December 5 and the Midwinter Blight begins on December 12, and I believe it also runs until the end of the Season. So that is also a seasonal event that all players can participate in. It starts in Kyovashad and the event takes place in Fractured Peaks. Obviously, Fractured Peaks is already a very snowy region, so I think just more storms blowing in.
You’ll meet a little Bard in the square of Kyovashad. You’ll have a beautiful holiday centerpiece that is very Diablo themed, and you’ll fight some of the demons that are out in the Fractured Peaks and eventually be able to summon the red-cloaked horror. What’s really great is there are 18 cosmetics that players can earn from this event that will carry over after the event ends that are obviously themed for the event. There are lots of Diablo-horrific things that the player character can wear like bells and fur trim to have a little bit of fun with that. I think it’s just going to be a very cool event. We have a boss that’s themed to the event itself, and it’s a way for us to bring the denizens of Sanctuary alive a little bit more and share what life is like for someone that lives in Sanctuary.






Joe Piepiora: Yeah, it’s the body horror holidays in Sanctuary and we are really excited about it.


Screen Rant: So we aren’t going to be seeing the Butcher in a Santa costume though?


Tiffany Wat: No, although that would be fun!


Screen Rant: Is Midwinter Blight going to only be on the Seasonal realm or is that going to be on the Eternal Realm as well? 


Joe Piepiora: That is on the Seasonal Realm, so if you want to participate in the Midwinter Blight you will have to go to the Seasonal Realm for that.




 New Features For Season Three Of Diablo 4 
Beginning The End Of January 2024
          

Screen Rant: So all of that is ending when Season 3 begins. Any hints for us on what Season 3 is going to bring?


Joe Piepiora: Well, I will say one thing. We are bringing you competitive mode in Season 3. So, we will be introducing a new feature called Trials in Season 3.





Screen Rant: The Leaderboards and all of that?


Joe Piepiora: Yeah, exactly. So Trials is what we are calling the competitive feature overall. Hall of the Ancients is like our leaderboards system within the Trials feature. Now, we didn’t want to just be basing our leaderboards on how quickly the players are leveling up, like we did in Diablo 2, for example. We wanted to have a more focused feature and thing for players to compete against. So we are creating a new content type called The Gauntlet.
The Gauntlet is a level 100 dungeon, it’s not as challenging as the Abattoir of Zir, or even a level 100 nightmare dungeon necessarily. It’s a little bit different from other dungeons in that when you go into it for the first time, it is actually an open-layout dungeon. So you go inside and there’s not really like an end room or a final boss or boss objective you’re trying to do. The only objective in there is to get as much score as you possibly can before the time runs out. So every monster you kill, events you complete, everything that you’re doing during the course of the run are going to be helping you earn that score. And another thing that’s really neat about the Gauntlet as a result of that is that, when you walk in, you don’t really know the best place to go to find the best score or the most monsters, or do any of these sorts of things.
The way the Gauntlet works is that it’s actually fixed for the duration of one week, and that’s going to be tied to the leaderboard according to the score. So, every monster in this space, every hallway, every chest, every shrine, every elite and affixes on that elite for the different effects it has, all of those things are going to be the same for you and for every other player that goes into that space during that week. So, your first run you might not do that great cause you’re still learning about where everything is. Your second run, you get to know a little bit more. And then, as you start to build a strategy for yourself, like you might decide initially you don’t want to go north because maybe there is a dead end down that way, maybe you want to go west instead and west can bring you closer to an event room and a bunch of other, like a shrine not too far from there, and you start to kind of plot out how to increase your score as you get more and more knowledge about the space of the Gauntlet for that week.
So, the leaderboard, as I mentioned, is tied to your performance in the Gauntlet. And then that Gauntlet is going to reset every week. Your high scores will carry over, so you can see in your profile how you performed in the past, but that’s the crux of it. When you’re going and competing this way, you’re going to be competing against other players of your class, so if you’re a sorceress you’ll be competing against other sorceresses, and so on and so forth. But you’ll also be able to compete in 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player versions of it as well. And we don’t care about your class for those. If you’re going to play in a duo, then you’re going to be on a duo leaderboard against any other combination of two players.
We are really excited about this. The fact that the layout is going to change every week means that your strategy might need to adapt a little bit. Like, if there’s a lot more monsters that might have a fire attack in there then maybe you’ll need to stack more fire resists, and those kinds of things you’ll just have to keep in mind as you work through the space. So players that are hungry for more competitive options for themselves in endgame to show off their prowess and their power, we’ll get to see an exciting first entry into the future sets for trials and kind of give themselves something to get them excited and stoked about playing.





                  Diablo 4 Season 3 Is Bringing Back One Of Diablo 3’s Best Features   Diablo 4’s next season will include even more fun additions to the game, including a play mechanic feature that was very successful in Diablo 3.   

Screen Rant: With the leaderboards, will you be able to see specifically people that are on your Battle.net friends list or clans or is it just worldwide?


Tiffany Wat: Absolutely, yes all of those filter options are available. That will be helpful for me, since I don’t know that I’ll be able to make it to the top of the leaderboards, but being able to compare myself and how I’m doing against Joe here, that is going to be really exciting for me.



Joe Piepiora: It’s funny that you mention that too because one thing that I failed to talk about before, so I’m glad you mention that, is that when you’re progressing through the leaderboard system initially, there are these things called Seals that you earn. And, you’re not really competing against other players right away when you get into the feature.
Initially, you’re just going to be progressing through a series of score markers you have to pass, and you’re going to have to unlock a seal for each time. So imagine those as like your bronze, silver, and gold times or something like in other kinds of experience. These are developer-set values that players are going to be looking to clear in order to unlock that seal for themselves for that week. And it’s a little bit of bling that you get to show off in your profile later on to indicate that you’ve managed to achieve this in the past. And once you’ve kinda gone through the first three tiers of the seals in the system, and you’re in that last tier, now you’re gonna place against other players who managed to get to that point.
But we want you to be able to go into it and see that initially this may be a little bit tough, but you can see you’re really close to being able to get that first seal, and you can push a little, and you might be able to get it. Then you’ll be able to get that and see how close you are to the second seal and so on and so forth until you decide that you’re comfortable enough for the run if you haven’t ever competed on a leaderboard before, for example, and maybe just try to push a little bit further and just see how far you are able to get up against other players of your class.





Screen Rant: I always have to ask... Are pets coming to Diablo 4 like we had in Diablo 3? I love the pets and I miss them. 


Tiffany Wat: We also love the pets, we are fans of them in Diablo 3 and other games. I think it’s a great idea, and something that we are excited about as well as an idea.



Joe Piepiora: Yeah, nothing to confirm, but we will be supporting Diablo 4 for years to come and there are all kinds of fun returning ideas from other entries in the series, it’s possible they might find their way into Diablo 4.


Screen Rant: I know the campfire chat is happening as soon as we finish this interview, so is there anything that you want to have touched on in this interview that I may not have knowledge of to ask about? Or anything that you wanted to talk about that I have not brought up?


Joe Piepiora: We are making one other update for players who are playing a lot right now and are using the enchanter, using the enchanting option at the occultist, whenever you decide to enchant an item and randomly reroll an affix, we are going to now show you a new preview of all the affixes that it could roll for that item. So you’ll have a better idea of what a ring or what a pair of boots are capable of, before you start trying to endlessly gamble on the occultist. This is based on player feedback, trying to make the experience cleaner and clearer for players and just more fun across the board.
