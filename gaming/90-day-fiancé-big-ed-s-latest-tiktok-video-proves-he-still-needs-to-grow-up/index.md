## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé star Big Ed Brown is unable to move on from Rose Vega even amid rumors of his split with Liz Woods. He&#39;s still making videos about her.




90 Day: The Single Life star Big Ed Brown’s new video proves how desperate he is to get a new girlfriend after his alleged split from Liz Woods. Big Ed, 56, became a meme because of his iconic scenes with Rose Vega in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4. Big Ed didn’t treat Rose well. He humiliated her by making Rose look like a gold digger and talking about her bad breath and body hair. Big Ed earned the title of a franchise villain, while Rose became an overnight icon. Big Ed began dating Liz Woods after Rose, and now she&#39;s even reportedly moved on with a new man.




Big Ed reposted a TikTok video on Instagram in which he recreated a popular scene featuring him and Rose Vega.


 

In the scene, Rose and Big Ed are at a resort where Rose admires her surroundings and exclaims, “I like the view.” Big Ed asks, “You do?” and when she says, “Yes,” Big Ed replies, “You’re my best view,” making Rose cringe and say, “Ngeehh?!” Big Ed filmed his new clip using the scene’s audio inside a restaurant. He roped in a waitress to mouth Rose’s lines. A fan told Big Ed, “Dude, you need some serious help. Always faking the funk and blaming the women you meet. Grow up,” in the comments.

 Big Ed&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Behavior Explained 
          

“This is kinda getting old now. No it’s old let it go. It’s embarrassing now for you,” said a fan who wanted Big Ed to stop milking the trend. “Ed, please grow up. You’re so childish. Low shots with other women to try to make your fiancé jealous is the reason why you guys will not work out and she deserves BETTER,” said a different fan. Meanwhile, some other followers asked Big Ed where Liz was and why he was flirting with a different woman. Big Ed’s reputation in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise has been that of a creepy man always trying out new ways to stay relevant.

It came as a shock when Liz started dating Big Ed during 90 Day: The Single Life season 1. They broke up at the end of the season because he was moving too fast in the relationship. Big Ed and Liz got back together after his dog passed away, and she reached out to support him. They broke up and got back together another 13 times over the last couple of years until they landed on 90 Day: The Last Resort. The problems of the other couples were much more serious than those of Big Ed and Liz, who were mostly dealing with trust issues.




Big Ed and Liz left The Last Resort feeling good about their relationship as they moved into a new house together in Arkansas and reportedly got married in August 2023. However, in just a few months, Liz started posting about a new man on Instagram. She has been showing off her fun dates with her alleged new boyfriend on social media, as Big Ed is continuing to deny any rumors of a breakup. The couple’s journey, which started on 90 Day: The Single Life, has seemingly come to an end, and Big Ed is certainly looking for his next best view as he was also recently spotted on a dating app.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
