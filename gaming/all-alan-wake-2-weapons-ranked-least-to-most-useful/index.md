## Literature Review

Alan Wake 2 features a total of eight unique weapons, though they are all exceptionally well designed, some are far more useful in-game than others.




Remedy Entertainment and Epic Games Publishing&#39;s survival horror game Alan Wake 2 has an incredibly restricted number of weapons to choose from - though this may sound like a negative, it is thematically appropriate and only furthers the need to carefully select which weapons to carry. Moreover, as the game has two protagonists with unique firearm arsenals, the number of weapons available at any one time is yet further limited - Sage has five guns to choose from, and Alan has only three. While all the guns can be useful in the right circumstances, some are far superior when compared with others.
Set over a decade after the events of its predecessor, Alan Wake 2 sees the return of the titular protagonist; however, he is trapped within an alternate dimension in which he can manipulate events with his writing. As he attempts to write his way to safety, his new horrific tale traps a young FBI agent, Saga Anderson. Though the game only possesses a grand total of eight firearms, the developers of Alan Wake 2 have clearly elected to go with the philosophy of quality over quantity, as even the weakest gun in the game is still a pleasure to use.
            
 
 6 Alan Wake 2 Voice Actors You Probably Recognize 
The survival horror game Alan Wake 2 has a cast of exceptional vocal actors, many of whom have illustrious careers and voices that you may recognize.













 








 8  Pistol (Sage) 
Available By Default


 







As with many first-person shooting games, or games with weapons for that matter, the armaments obtained by the player at the very start of their adventure are often one of, if not the weakest and most inaccurate in the game. Alan Wake 2 is no exception as Sage&#39;s default weapon, the Pistol, is by far the worst gun in the game. Low stopping power and abysmal accuracy, Sage&#39;s Pistol should only be reverted to when Sage is running low on ammunition for the game&#39;s other, more impactful, guns. The only upside to this pathetic gun is the sheer prevalence of its ammunition - it seems to be scattered about almost everywhere.
            
 
 Alan Wake 2 Ending Explained (In Detail) 
Alan Wake 2 ends just as cryptically as it begins. Here’s what happens in the final chapters of the story, and what they mean for a sequel or DLC.









 7  Revolver (Alan) 
Chapter: Initiation 2 - Casey (The Dark Place)
        

Although laden with nostalgia, Alan Wake&#39;s trademark Revolver and flashlight combo is not a very effective weapon - without upgrades, oftentimes times several shots will need to be discharged before a Taken is dispatched. Though Alan&#39;s Revolver is his main weapon throughout the early game, the weaknesses of this gun are only exemplified more and more as the game progresses and the enemies increase in difficulty. Though nostalgia is powerful, it won&#39;t help Alan for long.
            
 
 &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review 
Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedy’s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.









 6  Sawed-Off Shotgun (Sage) 
Chapter: Return 2 - The Heart (Cauldron Lake)
        

While Sage&#39;s default Pistol is an abysmally weak firearm option, it can be replaced fairly early on in a run of Alan Wake 2 with the Sawed-Off Shotgun. In Chapter: Return 2 - The Heart, Sage will be able to obtain this moderately powerful shotgun provided she can solve the General Store gun case combination lock in Cauldron Lake - fortunately, it is not a huge challenge to do so. While significantly more powerful than Sage&#39;s default Pistol, the Sawed-Off Shotgun has its limitations, particularly its ammo capacity and reload time; however, these downsides can be rectified by upgrading the Sawed-Off Shotgun.





 5  Flare Gun (Alan) 
Chapter: Initiation 4 - We Sing (Talk Show Studio)


 







The Flare Gun, a veteran of the Alan Wake franchise, makes a triumphant return in Alan Wake 2. Though not especially lethal, the Flare Gun is particularly useful at removing the shadows from Taken - an ability that can be invaluable if Alan has run out of light. Firing an explosive flare, the Flare Gun can be obtained in the Talk Show Studio as part of Chapter: Initiation 4 - We Sing. Although it should never be Alan&#39;s main weapon, keeping the Flare Gun in Alan&#39;s inventory can be a literal lifesaver if things suddenly go dark and begin to turn bad.
            
 
 How Alan Wake 2 Differs From The Original 
Alan Wake 2 must distinguish itself from the original game while still following in its footsteps. Here’s everything that changes in the sequel.









 4  Hunting Crossbow (Sage) 
Chapter: Return 3 - Local Girl (Watery)
        

The Hunting Crossbow is perhaps the most unique weapon in Alan Wake 2 - for a number of reasons. Most obviously, it fires arrows rather than ballistic munitions, but, more significantly, its usefulness is enormously dictated by the player&#39;s skill with the weapon. While it isn&#39;t hard to miss with any of Alan Wake 2&#39;s guns, missing a shot with the Hunting Crossbow is incredibly easy. Managing to master the Hunting Crossbow can make it one of the best weapons in the game as it is powerful, lethal, and, best of all, quiet; however, even the best crossbowmen will see many of their shots end up far from their intended target.





 3  Pump-Action Shotgun (Sage) 
Chapter: Return 6 - Scratch (Sheriff&#39;s Station)
        

The Pump-Action Shotgun is the final weapon Sage can acquire during a playthrough of Alan Wake 2. Unlockable during Chapter: Return 6 - Scratch, the Pump-Action Shotgun is a phenomenal gun with an impressive combination of rapid reload speed and lethal stopping power that puts the Sawed-Off Shotgun to shame. Sage can obtain the Pump-Action Shotgun by solving the gun case combination puzzle located in the Bright Falls Sheriff’s Station - though this is one of the harder gun case combination puzzles in Alan Wake 2, the powerful prize concealed within is certainly worth the frustration and time to crack.





 2  Hunting Rifle (Sage) 
Chapter: Return 5 - Old Gods (Wellness Center)
        

Arguably, the best weapon Sage can obtain in Alan Wake 2, the Hunting Rifle, has the power to kill a Taken with one well-placed shot. Devilishly accurate, devastatingly powerful, and surprisingly fast to reload, the Hunting Rifle is a phenomenally useful weapon that, in the right hands, can be OP - even before being upgraded. Sage can acquire the Hunting Rifle in Chapter: Return 5 - Old Gods, by solving a puzzle at the Wellness Center in the Valhalla Nursing Home - unlike many weapons in Alan Wake 2, it is not a gun case combination, but a pretty tricky computer password puzzle.





 1  Double-Barrel Shotgun (Alan) 
Chapter: Initiation 5 - Room 665 (Oceanview Hotel)


 







Undoubtedly Alan&#39;s best weapon in Alan Wake 2, and quite possibly the best weapon in the game irrespective of the user, the Double-Barrel Shotgun is a Taken killing machine. Though limited in power and precision when compared with Saga’s Hunting Rifle, Alan&#39;s Double-Barrel Shotgun has the innate ability to fire two shots (in quick succession) before needing to be reloaded - Furthermore, the reload time is very quick. Only obtainable by Alan in Chapter: Initiation 5 - Room 665, players can get the Double-Barrel Shotgun from behind the bar in the Oceanview Hotel. Though not perfect, Alan&#39;s Double-Barrel Shotgun is quite possibly the most useful weapon in Alan Wake 2.
