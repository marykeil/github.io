## Literature Review

The Sword Master is the second boss you face in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and is the opponent who can only be beat with a careful strategy.





There are no upgrades or items that Sargon would ordinarily be able to use against many of the bosses seen later in the cursed Citadel in Prince of Persia: TLC. However, you still have basic combat skills from the tutorial level, where you fought against the Kushan army. Sargon also unlocks a brand-new skill as this fight begins that can be an incredible tool for this fight if used correctly.




                  Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Review: &#34;An Underwhelming Story Redeemed By Riveting Combat&#34;   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great new addition to the Metroidvania subgenre that offers players unique combat and a good time.   


 How To Defeat The Sword Master 
          

The Sword Master can be defeated easily if you do not get hit enough times to fully charge your Athra Surge in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. This boss is a hulking warrior who cannot be launched for air combos like many enemies you&#39;ve encountered. This forces you to be careful with your attacks and not put Sargon in a position where the Sword Master can knock you out of the air.



You will not have any Amulets in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown to equip during this boss fight, so you have to rely solely on what you&#39;ve learned in combat in the first two levels to overcome this challenge.







Unstoppable attacks are introduced in this boss fight as moves that can&#39;t be parried by Sargon. If you attempt to parry a move when the Sword Master&#39;s eyes glow red, the attack will hit you to deal nearly twice the damage it would normally inflict. Since you only have three health bars, you could easily die after only three mistakes like this during the boss fight.

                  8 Beginner Tips You Need To Know For Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   The combat and exploration of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be confusing for beginners, but a few tips can mold Sargon into a great warrior.   

The Sword Master wields a large shield that prevents attacks from his front from landing. You need to jump over the boss or slide under his attacks to get behind them and begin landing attacks of your own. Landing attacks and not getting hit by unstoppable moves will allow you to charge your Athra Surge or a special attack that unleashes pure energy into a devastating strike.

Your Athra Surge, Verethragna&#39;s Smite, causes you to rush toward an enemy with a piercing strike that shatters defenses. This move will break the Sword Master&#39;s shield for a time and allow you to land even more attacks against the boss. Charging this move and landing it at least once will put you in the best position to beat the Sword Master in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.
