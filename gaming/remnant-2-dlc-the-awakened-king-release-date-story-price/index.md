## Literature Review

The first expansion for Remnant 2, called The Awakened King, has been revealed. Here are all the details about the DLC, including its date and price.




Remnant 2’s The Awakened King DLC has been revealed by publisher Gearbox, which has also showcased a bit more about the content that players will be exploring. The expansion is due to arrive soon and will bring a full new storyline, as well as new weapons, items, enemies, and even a new Archetype in Remnant 2 to play with. The release date, platforms, and price for the DLC have also been revealed, leaving little else information to worry about before it actually arrives. The game will still be set in Losomn, but players will be facing an entirely new and unexpected threat within the region.




Remnant 2 is a third-person shooter released earlier this year and has the soulslike formula woven into its gameplay style. It is a direct sequel to Remnant: From The Ashes, originally released in 2019. While there is a connection between both titles, the second game evolved a lot when it comes to gameplay mechanics and quality-of-life features, so much so, that there are several things to know before playing Remnant 2. The game, for instance, has its maps procedurally generated. This means that there is a degree of randomization in the layout of the map each time players go through it.

The release date for Remnant 2: The Awakened King DLC is set for November 14, 2023. The expansion, which is the first of at least three planned ones for the soulslike game, will arrive on all platforms on which the base game is available, meaning players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC will be able to experience the new adventure. The information was revealed by a post on the official Remnant 2 website.



The release date and platforms are also featured in the first official trailer for the DLC, which can be seen on the official Remnant 2 profile on YouTube.






 Remnant 2: Awakened King DLC - Price &amp; DLC Bundle Explained 
         

The Awakened King DLC for Remnant 2 has also had its official price revealed. According to Gearbox, the expansion will cost $9.99. This price is set on all platforms on which the game is available. There may be a slight variation according to the online shop in which it is purchased. This is also true about regional markets, which may convert the price accordingly. $9.99 is the price set for the individual purchase of The Awakened King, though players have another option. It is possible to buy the DLC Bundle pack, for $24.99. Other than The Awakened King, the bundle will grant access to the two DLCs coming in 2024.





 

The two other DLCs for Remnant 2 have not yet been revealed nor do they have a more precise release window, but they are set to arrive next year. Players who purchase the DLC Bundle for $24.99 will get immediate access to the two pieces of content once they arrive at some moment in 2024. Players who buy or have already purchased the Ultimate Edition of Remnant 2 will automatically have access to The Awakened King. This special edition will also grant access to the two upcoming DLCs next year. There are several ways of buying The Awakened King DLC, so players have to decide what is best for them.



 The Story Of The Remnant 2: Awakened King DLC 
          




The story of The Awakened King will deviate a bit from that of the one told in Remnant 2. The DLC will follow the story of the One True King, who has been awakened from his slumber and now seeks vengeance. According to Gearbox, the king has been corrupted by Root, which transformed him into a vile being. One True King’s cursed castle mysteriously appears on the shores of a Dran coastal town and, from there, he launches his campaign of revenge. Players will have to explore the surrounding area and gradually make their way inside the castle to ultimately stop him.

The exact details of how this progression will happen and if Root is the only factor that has corrupted him remains unknown. What can be seen in the trailer is that Nimue from Remnant 2 seems to have been captured – the NPC is shown in chains within the premises of the castle, and it looks like she is crying. Nimue reveals that she has served the king before the events of The Awakened King, but states that he has been warped into a tyrant. It is likely that players will have different choices in the DLC, too, as Nimue mentions they will have to decide between “duty” and “home.”






 New Ritualist Archetype In The Remnant 2: Awakened King DLC &amp; Maps 
          

In addition to this new storyline that deepens the lore of Remnant 2, there will also be a new Archetype in The Awakened King DLC called The Ritualist. The exact nature and abilities of the Archetype are still unknown, but the post on the official website does mention a few details, further teasing players. According to Gearbox, Ritualist is a class that excels at inflicting status effects on enemies. It is uncertain what status effects in Remnant 2 they will be able to use against foes, but more information about the Archetype will be revealed in the days leading up to the release of the DLC.



 New Map, Weapons, &amp; Items In Remnant 2: Awakened King DLC 
          




The map of Losomn will be increased even further with the arrival of the One True King’s castle in the DLC, though exactly how much remains to be seen. Gearbox does promise that there will be multiple new dungeons to delve into, most of which will also feature new pieces of gear. The Remnant 2 expansion will also feature a set of new characters to meet, enemies to face, and bosses to be killed by, some of which may be ocean-themed – with such information, it does seem to suggest that the cursed castle arose from the bottom of the sea.

Gearbox also promises that players will gain access to a “wide array of new weapons, modifications, amulets, and rings.” The specifications of these items and how many will be added have not yet been mentioned. The initial impressions of The Awakened King DLC are quite positive, according to Screen Rant, so hopefully, this is the start of a prosperous time for expansions in Remnant 2, which will allow players to revisit the popular soulslike game with fresh new content to be challenged by.
