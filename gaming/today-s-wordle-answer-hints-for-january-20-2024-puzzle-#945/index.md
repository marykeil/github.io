Players will have to solve January 20th’s Wordle answer using words that let them discover the correct positions of the two vowels.

This prevents players from using random words in their subsequent attempts and forces them to use words that contain those letters in the same spot. This might seem time-consuming at first, but it does help in developing new strategies that can be transferred to the regular mode.
