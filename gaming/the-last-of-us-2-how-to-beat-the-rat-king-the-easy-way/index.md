## Literature Review

The Last of Us 2 has many new horrifying displays of the fungal infection, including the Rat King boss that cannot be beaten easily during the story.





The Rat King is perhaps one of TLOU2&#39;s most challenging and terrible boss fights, but there are good ways to approach this fight before it happens. Stock up on supplies like ammunition, healing items, or throwable objects to give yourself a fighting chance in TLOU Part 2. A specific strategy can also be a key difference between life and death against the Rat King.




                  10 Beginner Tips You Shouldn&#39;t Play The Last Of Us 2 Without Knowing   With the launch of The Last Of Us 2 Remastered here are 10 Beginner Tips to know before jumping into the game if you haven&#39;t played the series before.   


 How To Beat The Rat King in The Last Of Us Part 2 
          

The best strategy for beating the Rat King in TLOU2 is to use the environment to create space between Abby and the boss. The Rat King can instantly kill you if it manages to grab Abby throughout the fight, so you need to keep your distance. This amalgamation of infected has the speed of a Clicker and the strength of a Bloater to pursue you relentlessly.

Walls and other obstacles can slow down the Rat King while you dump damage into its grotesque mass with whatever your best weapons are. The boss has to crash through objects to reach you, but don&#39;t assume that one or two small blockades can slow this beast down too much. It may take a few attempts to understand what slows down the Rat King the most in The Last Of Us Part 2.






The Rat King can break through walls, giving Abby access to a hole to get away, as it also slows down the boss&#39; movement.




 Pipe Bombs and the Flamethrower are the strongest tools against the Rat King since they both deal some of the highest damage to zombies. Ammo, alcohol, canisters, and even a few explosives can be picked up from the area as you flee from the boss in TLOU Part 2 between opportunities to shoot it. After a time, a short cutscene will show a Stalker separating from the Rat King to stalk Abby.

The remaining half of the Rat King is a Bloater-type enemy and is the easier of the two to kill first in TLOU Part 2. Remember to stay away from the Bloater and pepper it with Shotgun shots, bombs, and flames when you can. You will need to watch out for the Stalker actively at the same time, but keep in mind that this enemy can be dealt with similarly to a Shambler zombie in TLOU Part 2.






If you have the time, you can also craft different weapons, ammo, and tools from parts found in the Hospital to adjust your arsenal on the fly against the Rat King.




 Head to the Exit when you take down the Bloater to encounter the Stalker half one last time. The Double Barrel Shotgun with Incendiary Shells can easily tear through this final zombie, ending this nightmarish battle. While there is no easy way to take down the Rat King fast in The Last of Us Part 2, the right plan can save you from one of the longest and toughest fights in the game.
