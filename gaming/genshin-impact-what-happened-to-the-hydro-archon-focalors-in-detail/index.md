## Literature Review

A turmoil of events took place in Fontaine’s Archon Quests, involving the Hydro Archon Focalors and other characters. Here are all the details.




The Hydro Archon Focalors in Genshin Impact was highlighted to a great extent in Version 4.2, the update that concludes the first part of the Archon questline situated in Fontaine. Focalors, who also goes by the name Furina in Genshin Impact, is the second Hydro Archon in the Nation of Justice, and the successor to Egeria. The first Archon was killed during the Cataclysm, and Focalors is the only one whom the Traveler meets during their time in Fontaine. Furina is a charismatic entity with a personality that thrives on flair – however, there have been signs that there is much more to her than a love for the theatrics.

Since players first encounter her, Furina seems to be hiding a secret. There are several instances in which she appears questioning herself and the events in Fontaine. In fact, she is completely stunned when Childe is found guilty by the Oratrice Mecanique d&#39;Analyse Cardinale, which went in direct opposition to Neuvillette’s verdict. Later on, Furina starts experiencing an intense amount of anxiety due to the impending prophecy in Genshin Impact, which states that the sea will devour all Fontainians, and she will remain alone on her throne, weeping. With Version 4.2, the mysteries behind Furina’s behavior and the prophecy itself have now been revealed following a series of shocking events.

                  Genshin Impact: Furina Character Builds (Weapons, Artifacts, Team Comps)   Building Furina can be tough, especially because she can play three different roles in a party. Here are her best builds and teams in Genshin Impact.   





 Furina Was The Fake Archon In Genshin Impact 
          

As seen in the events that take place in Chapter IV: Act V of the Archon Quests, Furina is not the actual Hydro Archon in Genshin Impact, but a separate entity from Focalors altogether. Furina is a human vessel held in the seat of the Hydro Archon in order to trick the Heavenly Principles and does not possess any aspect of divinity. She was merely an actress. Furina played the role at Focalors’ behest for 500 years but was discovered to be a fraud by Neuvillette and the Traveler when the prophecy started to encroach. Nevertheless, that was timely enough to have Focalors put her plan into action.



 What Was Focalors’ Plan In Genshin Impact? 
          




Focalors’ plan was to save human life in Fontaine. The second Hydro Archon in Genshin Impact was aware of the prophecy and took on the burden left by her predecessor, Egeria. During her reign, the first Archon transformed Oceanids into human beings, an act that was condemned by the Heavenly Principles of Celestia and set to be punished in due time – this punishment was the prophecy. The punishment would have the Primordial Sea rise once again and engulf Fontaine, thus reverting the humans back into Oceanids, leaving nothing else but the Hydro Archon on her throne.



Although Egeria was slain in the Cataclysm, the punishment was inherited by Focalors.




The new Hydro Archon knew she was unable to impede the rising of the Primordial Sea and, subsequently, the prophecy from becoming true. As such, Focalors created the Oratrice in Genshin Impact, a machine that operated as a judge in Fontaine’s courthouse, but that fostered Indemnitium. Although a part of this energy was being used in Fontaine’s day-to-day operations, it was also being gathered by Focalors to craft a giant Indemnitium sword. In the meantime, Furina played her part as the Hydro Archon to keep the Fontainian population at bay and unaware of Focalors’ plans. The most important part of her role, however, was deceiving the Heavenly Principles.




Because gathering enough Indemnitium for Focalors’ plan would take time, Furina feigned being the Hydro Archon for five centuries – an act that took a toll on her. She did not know when Focalors would act and relieve her from her job. During the events in Chapter IV: Act V of Genshin Impact, Neuvillette and the Traveler become suspicious of Furina’s identity as the Hydro Archon and have her judged. Ultimately, the evidence shown results in Focalors being considered guilty of deceiving the population of Fontaine, and the punishment is the death of the Hydro Archon. This is when players discover that Furina and Focalors are separate entities.

The outcome of the trial is somewhat given out by Focalors herself, as she had planned centuries ago. The Hydro Archon realized that the only way to stop the rising waters of the Primordial Sea is to return the powers of Hydro back to its original owner, the Hydro Sovereign Dragon – this creature is Neuvillette in Genshin Impact. For clarification, the powers of the elemental dragons of Teyvat, which originally ruled the world, were stolen by the Primordial One and used to create the seats of the Seven Archons. The only way to restore the power of a dragon would be to destroy the seat of the Hydro Archon.




Focalors knew this, so her plan was to execute herself, thus destroying the seat of the Hydro Archon, and returning the Authority of Hydro back to the dragon that rules over Fontaine in Genshin Impact. However, it took a long time to do it because she had to gather a lot of Indemnitium to craft a weapon powerful enough to kill a god. Luckily, her plan was put into motion right before the prophecy. Following Furina’s trial, Focalors executes herself and, in doing so, returns the Authority of Hydro to Neuvillette. With his complete power restored, Neuvillette ascends and is able to absolve the Fontainian people from their crimes.

When he does this, Fontainians touched by the Primordial Sea will no longer be transformed back into Oceanids. Effectively, the punishment put out by the Heavenly Principles occurred, as the rising seawater engulfed the entire region, but the people of Fontaine did not pay the price – instead, it was the Hydro Archon who embraced the punishment and used her own death to keep Fontainians safe in Genshin Impact. After this, the water levels diminished, and peace in the region was restored.






Furina was also relieved from her duty, abdicated from the responsibilities of impersonating the Hydro Archon, and went on to live as a normal human.






 Is Neuvillette The New Hydro Archon In Genshin Impact? 
         

Although Focalors died and returned the elemental Authority to the Sovereign Dragon of the region, Neuvillette is not the new Hydro Archon. When Focalors executed herself and gave back the Hydro Authority to the Sovereign Dragon, she effectively shattered the seat of the Hydro Archon among the Seven in Genshin Impact. This means that there is no longer any space for a Hydro Archon in Teyvat. The only way that a new Hydro Archon would come into existence now is if the Primordial One stole Neuvillette’s Authority once again and gave it to a new god.




Among the five Nations of Teyvat so far, Fontaine is the only one that lacks an Archon and is overseen by the original elemental Sovereign. Neuvillette has committed himself to staying in Fontaine and sticking to his regular duties for however long he is needed, even if his full dragonhood has been restored. What the extermination of an Archon seat in Celestia means and how the Heavenly Principles will react remains to be seen as Genshin Impact pushes further into its third year of content.
