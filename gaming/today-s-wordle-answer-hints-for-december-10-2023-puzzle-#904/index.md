 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
December 10th #904
          




The December 10th Wordle answer is CHAIN.

We solved today&#39;s word quite quickly by using the starting Wordle word, IRATE. This provided a great start with both vowels, one in the correct location and another in the wrong one. Moving the misplaced vowel around a bit we tried PLAIN as our second guess which locked in the &#39;I&#39; as well as a new letter &#39;N&#39;.

Finally, after a short think, we scored our Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, CHAIN. Another point for the new win streak we started after losing our 50&#43; streak two weeks ago.
