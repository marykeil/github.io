## Literature Review

In LEGO Fortnite, players can expand their settlements by recruiting Villagers. However, several requirements must be met before they can move in.





Unlike NPCs in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1, Fortnite’s Villagers will wander around and won’t typically be found in specific locations. In fact, they will walk right into your settlement if you have a Village Square, a basic utility item that only costs 10 Wood and 10 Granite. After placing a Village Square, you will need to craft some extra items and meet a few specific requirements to start recruiting new Villagers.




                  8 Best Landing Spots In Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1   Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 introduces a new island with a high-speed rail network, tough bosses, and excellent landing spots for players to try out.   


 How To Add Villagers To Settlements In LEGO Fortnite 
          

To recruit a Villager in Fortnite, you will need to craft a Bed for them to sleep on. This only costs 10 Wood, so you shouldn’t have much trouble finding the resources. Oddly enough, Beds don’t need to be placed inside a structure, but you can always set them up inside a building such as a Simple Shack, so your Villagers don&#39;t have to sleep outside.

          




You also need to ensure your Village has capacity for new arrivals. Initially, you will only have enough space for one Villager to stay permanently, and you will be required to upgrade your Village to increase Village Capacity to unlock slots for more Villagers.

To upgrade your Village, you will have to craft and spend materials to buy your next upgrade. The first upgrade requires 15 Wood and 15 Granite, which is fairly cheap, but you can expect the costs to increase substantially as you expand outwards. You won’t unlock a slot for a Villager every time you upgrade, but plenty of other useful benefits make Village Upgrades essential.



You should also ensure you’re happy with where your Village is located. Unlike Fortnite Battle Royale, you won’t find great seasonal landing spots and recognizable landmarks. LEGO Fortnite’s worlds are procedurally generated, so exploration is essential.




          




You can then chat to any NPC that wanders past and invite them to live in your settlement. If you’ve met all the requirements, they will permanently accept and join your Village.



At Village Level 5, rarer Villagers can start to visit your Village, so keep an eye out for minifigures with skins you like.






 What Do Villagers Do In LEGO Fortnite? 
          

Once recruited, Villagers can take on a wide variety of different jobs to help out your Village. This includes working crafting stations, cooking, mining, and collecting nearby resources, including harvesting fruit and vegetables in Fortnite. You can assign jobs to individual Villagers, allowing you to focus on other aspects of settlement life. As a nice bonus, they can also give you gifts.




As such, you should aim to recruit as many villagers as you can in LEGO Fortnite. A lot of work goes into keeping a settlement thriving, so having a few helping hands can make all the difference.
