# There s One Big Problem With Dave The Diver s Best Indie Nomination At TGA 2023


## SUMMARY 



  Dave the Diver, developed by Nexon, is an excellent expamle of why The Game Awards needs to redefine &#34;indie games.&#34;   The definition of &#34;Indie Games&#34; has become fuzzier, with many people mistakenly assuming that unique gameplay and affordable prices automatically classify a game as indie. However, real indie games are made by small teams or individuals without the support of a big studio like Nexon.   Dave the Diver&#39;s nomination for Best Indie Game is unfair to other nominees in the category and overlooks true indie games.

## Literature Review

Dave the Diver is great, but its Best Indie Game nomination at The Game Awards 2023 has caused a stir. Hereâ€™s why, and what should be done.




Dave the Diver was nominated in the Best Independent Game category at The Game Awards. Released on June 28, 2023, for macOS and Windows, and followed by a Switch release on October 26, Dave the Diver has captivated players worldwide with its unique, genre-bending gameplay. Part roguelike RPG and part restaurant sim, it puts players in control of a diver, tasked with fending off sea monsters to supply a sushi restaurant&#39;s walk-in fridge during the day, then dishing out fish to exacting customers at night. Over time, players can upgrade both Dave&#39;s diving and cooking equipment, unlock recipes, and attract affluent diners to make his business easier and more lucrative.




Dave the Diver is a delight to play, and has been rightfully praised as one of the most enjoyable and unusual games to come out this year. It definitely deserves some kind of nod at TGA, but as many users on X (formerly Twitter) have noted, the Best Indie Game award really shouldn&#39;t apply to it. Even the community notes have argued against Dave the Diver really being an indie game, as noted in the post below.


 

The vice president of Nexon, the studio behind Dave the Diver, even seems to agree, as Kim Dae-hwon has stated, &#34;It may look like an indie, but it&#39;s not necessarily so.&#34;

 Is Dave The Diver Even An Indie Game? The Answer Is Complicated 
          




The problem most people have noted is that Dave the Diver shouldn&#39;t qualify for TGA&#39;s Best Indie Game Award because it isn&#39;t indie because it was developed by a huge game development studio responsible for some greatly profitable, popular games. Despite its low-fi aesthetics, relatively affordable price, and rejection of AAA game standards, Dave the Diver has a ton of big-studio power behind it.

Dave the Diver was developed by Nexon, a major developer/publisher. It&#39;s most readily associated with the MMORPG MapleStory, which has been live and regularly updated since 2003. But Nexon is also responsible for publishing a lot of major titles by other huge studios in South Korea: Counter-Strike Online and its sequel, Final Fantasy 14 (which has since been transferred to Actoz Soft), and the mobile versions of FIFA and EA FC.

However, Nexon didn&#39;t just publish Dave the Diver, but actively developed it (the main reason it technically qualifies as an &#34;indie&#34; title). It&#39;s credited to a smaller team called Mintrocket, but as a matter of fact, Mintrocket is entirely owned by Nexon. It&#39;s Mintrocket&#39;s first release, for which it definitely deserves to be commended, but it still has Nexon&#39;s funding behind it, which is why it blurs the line for what really defines an indie game.






 What Makes An Indie Game? 
The Definition Of &#34;Indie Games&#34; Has Gotten Fuzzier
          

In recent years, it&#39;s become harder to tell an indie game from a AAA one. Too many people assume that any title with stylized graphics instead of hyperrealistic ones, unique gameplay that departs from the typical open-world action RPG or live-service shooter formulas, and a price of under $60 USD automatically qualifies as an indie game. However, that&#39;s far from the case. An indie game is made by a small team, sometimes even a single person, that&#39;s not owned, supported, or funded by a big studio like Nexon.

It has absolutely nothing to do with a game&#39;s graphics, mechanics, or price, but because indie developers tend to be more willing to take creative risks and must work within smaller budgets, indie games often have more unique systems and stylized graphics. Mintrocket might be a small team, and Dave the Diver might have all the visual and mechanical hallmarks of an indie game, but it&#39;s owned and funded by Nexon, so it doesn&#39;t count.




That doesn&#39;t mean that indie games can&#39;t have a budget, or that any game developed by a named studio or published by a recognizable one isn&#39;t indie. Many indie games are crowdfunded through websites like Kickstarter, with prospective players directly contributing to a game&#39;s development fund. However, they do tend to have smaller budgets than AAA games on the whole, simply because they don&#39;t have access to big studio money. And many indie studios do have names and corporate-like structures, either for branding, tax benefits, or simplicity&#39;s sake. Many indie games are also published by larger studios, but they usually aren&#39;t involved in the games&#39; development.



 Why Dave The Diver&#39;s Nomination Matters 
         

It&#39;s more than just semantics: Dave the Diver&#39;s eligibility for Best Indie Game isn&#39;t fair to the other nominees in its category, or to any other indie game that came out this year. With the support of a massive game studio behind it, it&#39;s not fair to expect the other games in its category - Cocoon, Dredge, Sea of Stars, and Viewfinder - to match it in terms of scope or polish. And since Dave the Diver inevitably has a marketing budget, it has the potential to reach a wider audience. The Game Awards&#39; winners are decided by player votes, so with a significantly larger base, it already has the advantage.




Dave the Diver also pushes other eligible indie games out of the category&#39;s nominee pool, disqualifying them from the award. There have been many great indie games released in 2023, like Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, the long-awaited spiritual successor to the roller-skating, graffiti-tagging Dreamcast title Jet Set Radio. There&#39;s also the relaxing economic sim Mineko&#39;s Night Market, in which players must revitalize a small island&#39;s economy while dodging supernatural phenomena and shady investigators. World of Horror, a one-bit style roguelike in which players face off against cosmic terrors in order to save the world from an impending apocalypse, also saw a full release in 2023 after three years of early access.

These are all true indie games, and they barely scratch the surface of the many uniquely brilliant indie titles that came out this year. Whether they compare to Dave the Diver in mechanical innovation or general appeal isn&#39;t the issue. They were all made by small teams with small budgets, and deserve the attention brought by a Game Awards nomination. In fact, without the kind of marketing budget that&#39;s helped catapult Dave the Diver into the public attention, they need it even more.




So what should be done? There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with Dave the Diver - it&#39;s a perfectly good game, but it shouldn&#39;t qualify for an indie award. It&#39;d be too late and too severe to rescind its nomination, but in future years, a more stringent set of qualifications for the Best Independent Game award would make sense. It might be best to institute a Best AA Game category, to allow for recognition of simpler, low-budget games that still have big studio backing without detracting from the Best Indie category. Dave the Diver may have an unfair advantage at The Game Awards this year, but next year can be different.
