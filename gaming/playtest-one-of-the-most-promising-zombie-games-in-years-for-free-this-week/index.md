# Playtest One Of The Most Promising Zombie Games In Years For Free This Week


## SUMMARY 



  Nakwon: Last Paradise, a unique zombie game focused on extraction and stealth, will be free to play this week.   Players are encouraged to grab loot and escape without being caught by either hostile parties or mindless zombies. As players progress, they can spend cash on rent and improve their base, while also managing food supplies and equipment conditions.   The game will be free to play from November 29 to December 3, accessible via Steam. It&#39;s a pre-alpha version, so it won&#39;t be complete, and players won&#39;t be able to keep the game after the playtest.

## Literature Review

A new, unique-looking zombie game from an up-and-coming developer is free to play on PC this week. Here’s how to get it, and why it’s worth a try.




One of the most intriguing zombie games to come out in recent years, Nakwon: Last Paradise, will be free to play this week. Nakwon isn&#39;t the typical zombie game. It sets itself apart with a focus on extraction over simply mowing down zombie hordes. It definitely shares similarities with Call of Duty&#39;s DMZ game mode in that regard: players are encouraged to get in, grab as much loot as they can, and get out unscathed. Nakwon also involves stealth mechanics - hostile parties or mindless zombies may hear the sounds a player makes, and chase after them for their loot or their brains, respectively.




As a player gains more cash, they&#39;ll spend some of it on rent while saving up the rest to improve their base of operations. They&#39;ll also have to manage their food supplies and equipment conditions in order to keep fighting fit. Nakwon is being developed by Mintrocket, the studio behind The Game Awards 2023&#39;s Best Indie Game nominee Dave the Diver. Against-all-odds zombie survival is quite a tonal shift compared to Dave the Diver&#39;s unlikely combination of roguelike and management sim gameplay, but, much like its previous game, Mintrocket&#39;s next looks unique and interesting. And it&#39;ll soon be free to try out.

 How To Playtest Nakwon: Last Paradise 
Free To Play Beginning November 29
          

Beginning on November 29, 2023, at 5 PM PST, Nakwon: Last Paradise will be free to playtest until December 3. There&#39;s no limit on player counts, so those who can&#39;t start on day one have no need to worry about getting shut out. It&#39;ll be accessible via Nakwon&#39;s Steam page. Those who would prefer a steadier stream of updates, or would like to discuss bugs and potential features directly with the devs and other players, are encouraged to follow @NakwonGame on X (formerly Twitter), or join the Discord server linked on its Steam page.





 

Of course, the game is still in a pre-alpha state, which means it&#39;ll likely be far from complete. And unfortunately, players won&#39;t be able to keep the game after the five-day free playtest; think of it as an extended free trial with a hard, real-world time limit. In a Steam Update, Nakwon explains that the playtest timing may change due to any number of variables, but for the time being, it appears to be going ahead with a November 29 soft launch.

A free playtest like this one is a great way to gauge player interest and get eyes on a new game. And since it&#39;s so easy to access via the game&#39;s Steam page, players have almost nothing to lose except the time they sink into it. There&#39;s a lot yet to be revealed about Nakwon: Last Paradise, and the first true test of its long-term viability will be in the player response to this demo.
