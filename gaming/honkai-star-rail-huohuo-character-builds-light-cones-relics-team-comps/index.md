## Literature Review

Huohuo is a powerful healer in Honkai: Star Rail who is capable of also acting as a stat booster for her team comp. Here are her best builds.





Being able to remove debuffs in a fight against Phantylia in Honkai: Star Rail, for instance, is vital, as the enemy can reduce the Max HP of party members, putting them at risk when taking damage. In addition to that skill set, Huohuo can also buff party members, increasing their Energy Regeneration and boosting their ATK stat. Because of this, Huohuo is a complete support character. However, she needs to receive the proper treatment in order to perform as well as she can on the field.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Jingliu Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   To adequately use Jingliu as a main DPS in Honkai: Star Rail, you need to build her correctly and pair her up with the best team comps.   


 Best Light Cones For Huohuo 
         

As is common, the best Light Cone for Huohuo in Honkai: Star Rail is her signature 5-star weapon, Night of Fright. This premium Light Cone, which can only be obtained through limited-time banners whenever Huohuo herself is featured in the gacha system, provides benefits that work around the character’s kit. Equipping it grants a 12% increase to the Energy Regeneration Rate and, when an ally uses their Ultimate, the wearer restores HP for the ally with the lowest HP percentage, by an amount equal to 10% of the healed ally’s Max HP. When the wearer provides healing, it increases the healed ally’s ATK by 2.4%.






Huohuo’s healing scales off her own Max HP, which makes HP the most important stat in her build.




This effect can stack up to five times and lasts for two turns. Night of Fright is perfect for Huohuo since it essentially transforms her into an everlasting healer that does not rely solely on her Skill, and even helps the team with buffs, which her own skill set does. Alternatively, you can use Bailu’s signature 5-star Light Cone, Time Waits For No One. This equipment increases the user’s Max HP by 18% and Outgoing Healing by 12%. This Light Cone also registers the Outgoing Healing provided by the user and transforms that into extra damage against opponents targeted by allies.

Even if you do not have access to these 5-star items, there are 4-star Light Cones that you can give to Huohuo. The best one she can equip is Warmth Shortens Cold Nights, a Light Cone that can be obtained at level 30 on the paid track of the Nameless Honor Battle Pass in Honkai: Star Rail. It boosts the user’s Max HP by 16% and, when they use a Basic ATK or Skill, they restore all allies’ HP by an amount equal to 2.0% of their respective Max HP. This allows Huohuo to continuously heal the team, even if she opts to deal damage with her Basic ATK.




The table below lists the best builds for Huohuo in Honkai: Star Rail, including Light Cones, Relics, Ornaments, and stats:

 Best Build For Huohuo In Honkai: Star Rail   Light Cone    Night of Fright (Best 5-star)   Time Waits For No One (5-star substitute)   Warmth Shortens Cold Nights (Best 4-star)   Shared Feeling (4-star substitute)   Quid Pro Quo (4-star substitute)      Relic &amp; Ornament Set  Relics:  Passerby of Wandering Cloud (4 pieces)   Messenger Traversing Hackerspace (4 pieces)    Ornaments:  Broken Keel (2 pieces)   Fleet of the Ageless (2 pieces)   Penacony, Land of the Dreams (2 pieces - Mono Wind Team)      Stat Priority    HP   Outgoing Healing   SPD   Energy Recharge Rate (secondary stat)   Effect RES (secondary stat)      Skill Priority    Skill &amp; Talent   Ultimate   Basic Attack      



Because 5-stars and a Battle Pass-exclusive can be hard to obtain, there are still options for Huohuo. Shared Feeling is a good alternative in Honkai: Star Rail, as it increases their Outgoing Healing by 10% and, when they use their Skill, they help regenerate 2 Energy for all allies. It does not boost Max HP via its ability, but it offers great bonuses. Quid Pro Quo can also work as a Light Cone for Huohuo, as it restores 8 Energy for a randomly chosen ally at the beginning of her turn. It only boosts that, but it does go hand-in-hand with her other support skills.






 Best Relics, Ornaments, &amp; Stats For Huohuo 
          

When searching for the best Relic sets for Huohuo in Honkai: Star Rail, you have two great options so far. The first of them is the healer-focused Passerby of Wandering Cloud. By equipping two pieces of the set, the user’s Outgoing Healing is boosted by 10%. If all four pieces are equipped, the user will regenerate 1 Skill Point at the start of the battle. This can make Huohuo’s healing more effective, even if it does not actually boost her Max HP, the stat off which her abilities scale. This should only be used, however, if you are lacking healing and need to supplement HP restoration.

If Huohuo’s healing is satisfying with her Light Cone and enough good stats, you can use the Messenger Traversing Hackerspace set. With two pieces, this Relic set grants the user a 6% boost to SPD. If all four pieces are equipped, when the wearer uses their Ultimate on an ally, SPD for all allies increases by 12% for 1 turn. This set goes well with Huohuo’s secondary support abilities. Since she grants buffs to allies via her Ultimate, they would have their SPD boosted in addition to their ATK – and a SPD-based DPS like Seele in Honkai: Star Rail could benefit from the SPD bonus significantly.




The Ornament you will want to use with Huohuo will also vary according to your own preference. One of the options is Broken Keel. Its two-piece effect increases the user’s Effect RES by 10%. When their Effect RES is at 30% or higher, all allies’ CRIT DMG is boosted by 10%. With this, she can further support the team with more damage output.



Huohuo already has 18% of Effect RES granted via her Traces, plus 10% from the set, so you would only need to look for the 2% in a Light Cone or as a sub-stat in a Relic or Ornament piece to activate Broken Keel’s bonus.




For DoT (damage over time) teams that rely less on CRIT and more on pure ATK in Honkai: Star Rail, you can give Huohuo the Fleet of the Ageless Ornament set. The two-piece bonus grants her a 12% bonus to Max HP and, when the user’s SPD reaches 120 or higher, all allies’ ATK stat increases by 8%. Fleet of the Ageless only makes sense if you are giving her boots SPD as the main stat – it does sacrifice a bit of healing, but can put her higher up in the attack list and give her more chances of acting as a stat support character for the team other than simply a healer.




When farming Relics and Ornaments in Honkai: Star Rail, the stats you want to look out for are HP, Outgoing Healing, SPD, Energy Regeneration Rate, and Effect RES. A bit of HP can be sacrificed to give space to these other sub-stats. While boosting it is the best method of increasing the character’s healing potential, Huohuo is pretty good at granting buffs as well, so SPD could have her grant these buffs more swiftly, while Energy Regeneration could help her grant them more often. Effect RES makes her more resilient and, if equipped with Broken Keel, unlocks her potential to provide CRIT DMG.



Penacony, Land of the Dreams Ornaments may also make sense for Huohuo, as long as her team is mostly composed of Wind characters like Blade and Sampo – the set increases the user’s Energy Regeneration Rate by 5% and boosts DMG for all other allies with the same DMG Type as the user by 10%.






 Best Team Comps For Huohuo 
          




Huohuo is a very versatile healer and, in honesty, can be fit into most team comps. If set in traditional team comp, with a main DPS, a sub-DPS, and a support, this team can also be turned into a hypercarry team, as Huohuo is also a stat booster. Because her healing comes from her Skill, it is best if you use DPS characters that rely a little less on Skill points, such as Jingliu or Blade in Honkai: Star Rail. Heroes whose Ultimates are a large source of damage can also benefit from being paired up with Huohuo, as she will constantly provide extra Energy for them.

The table below lists a few team comp suggestions for Huohuo:

 Best Team Comps For Huohuo In Honkai: Star Rail   Hypercarry Team    Blade (Wind - Destruction) or Jingliu (Ice - Destruction)   Bronya (Wind - Harmony)   Yukong (Imaginary - Harmony) or Tingyun (Lightning - Harmony)   Huohuo (Wind - Abundance)      Mono Wind Team    Blade (Wind - Destruction)   Sampo (Wind - Nihility) or Dan Heng (Wind - Hunt)   Bronya (Wind - Harmony)   Huohuo (Wind - Abundance)      



Team comps in Honkai: Star Rail largely revolve around how Skill Points are utilized and a little less on synergy itself. Because of Huohuo’s versatility as a healer, she can be put into most team comps that have a regular structure that has such a role. Depending on how effectively built your Huohuo is as a support, you can also sacrifice another support unit and use a shielder, if you are in need of more protection. It will come down to your own preference and how the character is built.






 Skill Priority For Huohuo 
          

When leveling up Huohuo’s abilities in Honkai: Star Rail, also known as Traces, you will want to give her Skill and Talent the utmost priority. These are the Traces that are related to her healing abilities and, if you want to increase her HP restoration potential, these should be the first to be leveled up. Second to that, you will want to increase her Ultimate, which is the main source of her secondary support skills. The last priority should be her Basic ATK – she will not use it as much and when she does, it will not actually do much.

Building Huohuo is not particularly difficult, as she mostly relies on a single stat to fulfill her job. It can be a bit complicated to divide the efforts between healing and support, but healing should always be the priority of an Abundance character. If you do manage to pull Huohuo in Honkai: Star Rail, it is best if you give her the proper treatment.
