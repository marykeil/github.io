You can purchase Sugarcane from Goofy&#39;s stall for 20 Star Coins. However, since Sugarcane is used for many recipes, it is recommended to purchase Sugarcane Seeds for 5 Star Coins so that you can grow them on your farm.



Sugarcane takes only seven real-time minutes to grow and is a valuable crop to have for making food or selling it for Star Coins.

You will need to grow 45 Stalk of Sugarcane to make so many candies and have 45 chunks of Coal for the cooking process. Once you have made Candy Ã—45, consume all of them to unlock the skull-shaped caramel apple Motif in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
