## Literature Review

Charlotte has three distinct builds in Genshin Impact. Here are the best weapons, Artifacts, stats, and team comps for the Cryo catalyst character.





Charlotte uses a catalyst in battle and wields a Cryo Vision. Following the release of Wriothesley in Genshin Impact, she is the second character to have such a combination. This specific trait allows all of her Normal and Charged Attacks to be infused with Cryo, meaning she does not need to activate her Skill, Burst, or a special skill to land elemental attacks on enemies. Charlotte’s leaked kit in Genshin Impact was accurate, which means she can really play the role of a healer or a sub-DPS, depending on what you prefer and how she is built.

 Charlotte&#39;s Builds, Explained 
          

As shown by Game8, Charlotte can have three different builds in Genshin Impact that work quite nicely. The first is a fully dedicated Cryo-based sub-DPS build. This will increase her elemental damage output. The second build is a balanced mix between her sub-DPS abilities and her support skills, thus enhancing her ATK for more healing and Energy Recharge. The last build is a fully dedicated healer, which leaves aside her damage potential and embraces her restoration abilities.



 Best Weapons For Charlotte 
          




The best weapons for Charlotte in Genshin Impact will ultimately depend on the role she is playing in the team comp. If she is used as a sub-DPS or even a hybrid, the best catalyst for her is the 5-star Kagura’s Verity. At level 90, this weapon’s sub-stat offers a 66.2% bonus to CRIT DMG. Additionally, its skill increases Elemental Skill DMG by 12% for 16 seconds, up to three stacks by using the Skill itself. When all three stacks are obtained, the user gets a 12% All Elemental DMG Bonus. Since Charlotte’s main source of damage is her Skill, this is a perfect fit.

A 5-star alternative to this premium weapon is Skyward Atlas, which can be obtained from the regular banner and handed to Charlotte. This catalyst’s sub-stat grants a 33.1% bonus to ATK at level 90. It also increases the Elemental DMG Bonus by 12% and has a chance of unleashing extra attacks. Because much of her offensive power stems from ATK, this is a great weapon. Curiously enough, Skyward Atlas is the best catalyst for Charlotte’s healer build in Genshin Impact, because her healing potential relies on ATK.




The table below lists the best builds for Charlotte, including the ideal weapons for each build, Artifacts, stats, and more:

 Charlotte&#39;s Best Build In Genshin Impact   Weapon  Sub-DPS &amp; Hybrid:  Kagura&#39;s Verity (Best 5-star)   Skyward Atlas (Substitute 5-star)   Flowing Purity (Best 4-star - F2P)   Favonius Codex (Substitute 4-star)    Healer:  Skyward Atlas (Best 5-star)   Kagura&#39;s Verity (Substitute 5-star)   Favonius Codex (Best 4-star)   Oathsworn Eye (Substitute 4-star)      Artifact  Sub-DPS:  Blizzard Strayer (4 pieces)    Hybrid:  Noblesse Oblige (4 pieces)    Healer:  Ocean-Hued Clam (2 pieces) and Gladiator&#39;s Finale (2 pieces)      Stat Priority  Sub-DPS:  ATK   Cryo DMG   CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate    Hybrid:  ATK   Energy Recharge    Healer:  ATK   Healing Bonus   Energy Recharge      Skill Priority  Sub-DPS and Hybrid:  Elemental Skill   Elemental Burst   Normal Attack    Healer:  Elemental Burst   Elemental Skill   Normal Attack      



If these 5-star catalysts are not available, there are great 4-star weapons to equip Charlotte with. For her sub-DPS and hybrid builds, Flowing Purity is the way to go. Not only is it a F2P (free-to-play) alternative, but it grants great stats. Its sub-stat sees ATK increased by 27.6% at level 90. Flowing Purity also increases All Elemental DMG Bonus by 8% for 15 seconds when using an Elemental Skill, and grants even by clearing HP. If you are using Charlotte as a healer, Favonius Codex is the best substitute, according to Game8. This weapon significantly boosts Energy Recharge, further establishing Charlotte as a support.






Favonius Codex can be a 4-star substitute for Charlotte’s sub-DPS and hybrid builds, while Oathsworn Eye can be the 4-star alternative for her healer build.






 Best Team Comps For Charlotte 
         

The team comps for Charlotte can be quite flexible, regardless of the role she takes on. The rule of thumb in Genshin Impact is to build the team around the strengths and weaknesses of the main DPS and establish the preferred Elemental Reactions for that party. A great team comp for Charlotte as a healer is a Freeze-Bloom team, as pointed out by GameWith. Using Neuvillette as the main DPS, with Nahida and Kazuha as supports is a great way of spreading powerful Elemental Reactions. The table below lists a few team comp suggestions for Charlotte according to her role:




 Charlotte&#39;s Best Team Comps In Genshin Impact   Sub-DPS &amp; Hybrid Charlotte (Freeze-Bloom Team)    Charlotte (Sub-DPS &amp; Support)   Wriothesley or Ganyu (Cryo Main DPS)   Furina or Kokomi (Healer)   Kazuha or Sucrose (Anemo Support &#43; Swirl Trigger), or Zhongli (Shields)      Healer Charlotte (Permafreeze Team)    Charlotte (Healer)   Neuvillette (Cryo Main DPS)   Nahida (Dendro Bloom Support &amp; Sub-DPS)   Kazuha (Anemo Swirl-Spreader &amp; Support)      



If you want to give her a more active role as a sub-DPS or even hybrid character, you can use a permafreeze team comp, with Wriothesley as the main Cryo DPS, Kazuha as the support and Swirl-spreader, and Furina as a healer. Because Furina and Charlotte can take on the same exact roles, you can also set Charlotte as the healer for this team and use Furina as a sub-DPS. There are many choices, so long as Charlotte contributes to the Elemental Reactions via Cryo application or even Cryo Resonance.

                  Genshin Impact: Furina Character Builds (Weapons, Artifacts, Team Comps)   Building Furina can be tough, especially because she can play three different roles in a party. Here are her best builds and teams in Genshin Impact.    



 Best Artifacts, Stats, &amp; Skill Priority For Charlotte 
          




The Artifacts, stats, and skill priorities for Charlotte will shift depending on her role. As a sub-DPS, the best set to give her is Blizzard Strayer. With two pieces, she gets a 15% bonus to Cryo DMG and, at four pieces, her CRIT Rate is increased by 20% when she attacks an enemy affected by Cryo – which is perfect since her regular attacks apply Cryo. In addition to that, her CRIT Rate is boosted an extra 20% if the enemy is Frozen, making Freeze teams in Genshin Impact with Charlotte a sub-DPS a great match.

If she is being used as a hybrid, Noblesse Oblige is the best Artifact set to utilize. With two pieces, Charlotte gets a 20% boost to Elemental Burst DMG and, by using it, she increases all party members’ ATK by 20% for 12 seconds. This will improve Charlotte’s own healing ability, which relies on ATK and is triggered when she uses her Elemental Burst in Genshin Impact. The 2-piece bonus is quite dispensable, but it does come in handy if she is lacking a bit of damage output.




If Charlotte is a fully dedicated healer, then it is best to mix Gladiator’s Finale and Ocean-Hued Clam. With two pieces of Gladiator’s Finale, she gets a 20% ATK bonus, which improves her healing. The two pieces of Ocean-Hued Clam grant a 15% Healing Bonus to her, further optimizing her healing abilities in Genshin Impact. She relies entirely on her Elemental Burst to provide healing, so it is necessary to have a support character capable of keeping her Burst well-fed through Energy Recharge.

When farming Artifacts to use Charlotte as a sub-DPS, you need to look for pieces that boost her ATK, CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG, and Cryo DMG. If your intention is to use her as a hybrid sub-DPS and support, then you need to supplement her with ATK and Energy Recharge. If Charlotte is a fully dedicated healer, then your focus should be filling her up with ATK and Healing Bonus and, if possible, a bit of Energy Recharge to help her Burst be available at all times, disregarding the cooldown.



As a sub-DPS or a hybrid, Charlotte’s main priority is her Elemental Skill, followed by her Burst. If she is a healer in a team comp, her priority should be her Burst and then her Skill. Charlotte’s Normal Attack is the last priority, regardless of the specific build you are aiming for.







Building Charlotte is fairly easy, especially because her gameplay kit is quite straightforward. You will have to decide exactly what job she should perform in a team comp, but once that is taken out of the way, building the 4-star hero should not prove too difficult. It may be time-consuming, as farming Artifacts is still excruciating in Genshin Impact, but Charlotte may just be worth the effort, especially for F2P players looking for more variety beyond the national team.
