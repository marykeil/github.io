## Literature Review

The Arasaka Corporation&#39;s hostile takeover is a pivotal moment in Cyberpunk 2077 but one obvious plothole could&#39;ve changed the entire story.




Although Cyberpunk 2077 experienced a rocky road upon its release, after a number of patches it has become one of the best games to be released in recent years. One undeniable highlight of the game is its fantastic story - a story that features a number of exciting, and often unexpected, twists and turns. Perhaps the game&#39;s most notable surprising event comes during the fifth main job, &#34;The Heist,&#34; during which a seismic event takes place that shakes the political and social fabric of Night City. Furthermore, this out-of-the-blue occurrence results in one absolutely enormous Cyberpunk 2077 plot hole that potentially has huge consequences for the entire extended Arasaka family storyline.




[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077]In Cyberpunk 2077, Saburo Arasak, also known as the Emperor, was the CEO of one of the largest corporations in the world, the intercontinental megacorporation, Arasaka Corporation. Ruthless and power-hungry, even up until his death at the age of 158 years, Saburo retained a tight grip over his company and his remaining family members - his youngest son Yorinobu Arasaka, and his only daughter Hanako Arasaka. While Hanako respected and loved Saburo, Yorinobu passionately and vocally rebelled against his father, a fact that would eventually conclude with the Arasak family patriarch meeting his final and violent end at his son&#39;s hands.

                  Biggest Cyberpunk 2077 Plot Holes   Cyberpunk 2077 is a huge game with a complicated storyline and lots of interconnected quests, so itâ€™s no surprise that there are a few plot holes.    


 The Death Of An Emperor 
The End Of Saburo Arasaka
          




During the fifth main job in Cyberpunk 2077, &#34;The Heist,&#34; V and his accomplices end up in Yorinobu&#39;s Penthouse atop the Konpeki Plaza. Whilst searching for the coveted Relic, Jackie and V are startled to find that they are not alone in the Penthouse as its owner Yorinobu Arasaka, and his father Saburo Arasaka show up for an incredibly tense father-son chat - a discussion that rapidly deteriorates to the point where Yorinobu throttles Saburo to death. Though they have a front-row seat to this monumentally important murder, V inexplicably fails to record the hugely significant event, despite being in possession of high-tech gadgets that are theoretically capable of doing so.

The conversation between the 158-year-old Saburo and his son concerns Yorinobu&#39;s perpetually poor behavior; however, it quickly devolves as Yorinobu, clearly agitated, pacing back and forth, begins to criticize his father&#39;s schemes and selfishness. Yorinobu&#39;s anxiety and anger are juxtaposed by Saburo&#39;s icy calm; after accusing his son of treason and proclaiming his relief that his dead mother does not have to witness the man he has become, Yorinobu can no longer control himself and strikes. Following the death of Saburo, his bodyguard, Goro Takemura asks what happened to which Yorinobu initiates the lie that his father was poisoned by assassins - a claim that has serious repercussions throughout the game.






 Witness To A Family Dispute 
Why Didn&#39;t V Record Yonibou Murdering Saburo?
         

Though a simple autopsy could disprove the allegation that he was poisoned by assassins, V inexplicably did not record the hugely significant event that was taking place mere feet from him. While it would have been cynical to record the murder with the forethought that it could prove their innocence, it seems baffling that V did not film the event - especially considering the fact that they could have as they possessed high-tech gadgets that most likely had the capability to do so. This point of narrative incongruity has been noticed by many, with the Redditor Appropriate-Fudge810 starting a discussion on the r/cyberpunkgame subreddit - a thread with over 600 comments.


 




Throughout the over 600 comments on the Reddit discussion, numerous outlandish theories have been raised, some, however, are quite plausible. Particularly believable explanations for V&#39;s omission include: the veracity of such a video could be called into question owing to advancements in deep fake technology, V was under extraordinary stress/the danger posed by the situation dominated his thoughts, and V recognized that publishing such a video would make them a target for Arasaka. Overall, while there is little consensus regarding the reason for V&#39;s failure, there is general agreement that having footage of such an event would have been incredibly dangerous and likely disputed by all who viewed it.

Moreover, possessing the footage could present legal ramifications. They witnessed Yorinobu&#39;s crime while in the commission of a crime of their own, which while not as serious as the patricide of one of the world&#39;s most important men, was, nevertheless, a not insignificant legal transgression. Furthermore, being on tape during a heist could be perceived as a serious indictment of the quality of V&#39;s character - a fact that could call into question the footage itself.






 All Things Considered, Does It Really Matter? 
No Footage, No Problem.
          

Despite the fact that possessing a video of Saburo Arasaka&#39;s murder would have been invaluable if used at the correct point in the story, and could have been a worthwhile event to capture on camera, V&#39;s failure to record Yorinobu&#39;s crime is, in reality, of little significance. Later in the game, depending upon V&#39;s choices, it is made clear by Saburo&#39;s daughter and Yorinobu&#39;s sister, Hanako Arasaka, that no one believed Yorinobu&#39;s story, especially not her father&#39;s closest bodyguard, Takemura. Consequently, footage of the murder, though corroborating the hypothesis of many, would have had little to no impact on the way things play out by the end of Cyberpunk 2077.

The Arasaka family plays an enormous part in the narrative of Cyberpunk 2077, and though this potential plot hole could, depending upon personal interpretation, ruin the entire Saburo storyline, the opinion held by the vast majority of fans of the game is that Yorinobu&#39;s crime, filmed or no, would be uncovered eventually. Furthermore, the lack of a video depicting the death of Saburo Arasaka furthers the relationship between Hanako and V, as well as significant portions of the game&#39;s main story. It is impossible to know how the game would have played out had it been filmed, but its absence is not detrimental to the point of breaking Cyberpunk 2077.
