## Literature Review

As more players finish Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, thoughts turn to how a DLC would look should it ever happen, and what content should be included if it does.




Although nothing has been confirmed for a potential Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 DLC, that has not stopped speculation about how the game could be expanded. While BG3 is on its own an epic game with plenty for people to sink their teeth into, a DLC would be a great way to add back some cut content or expand on what is already there. From new areas and quests to adding more playable races and subclasses, there are more than a few ways Larian Studios could add to its masterpiece.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
Larian Studios has not traditionally released significant DLCs for its games previously, with both Divinity: Original Sin games only receiving smaller additions before their Definitive Editions were released. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has already enjoyed regular patch updates and changes since its launch, which have added everything from cosmetic changes to a full epilogue. Whatever form the content takes, there is no doubt that people would love the chance to spend more time in Larian&#39;s version of Faerûn.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  More Playable Races 
Adding More Races From Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ Extensive Library


 







One area of gameplay in BG3 that many have been crying out for is more playable races for custom characters. There are many DnD races that would work well in BG3, such as the feline tabaxi and the giant-like goliaths. There are also other races that feature in BG3, such as goblins, bugbears, and assimar, which are not currently available in character creation. With so many playable races in DnD, there is still no way all could be included in any expansion, but having a little more variety than the 11 classic races already in BG3 would be welcome.





 9  More Subclasses 
Giving Players More Customization Options For Their Classes
        

Larian Studios only scratched the surface when it comes to the plethora of subclasses found in DnD. Most classes in BG3 have at least three subclasses to choose from, while clerics and wizards have significantly more. However, there are some fantastic options that people are missing out on, such as the hexblade warlock and swashbuckler rogue. While the core subclasses for each class are present, there is a lot of fun to be had by adding more in a BG3 DLC.





 8  More Companions 
Adding Characters Of Different Backgrounds &amp; Alignments


 







BG3 has 10 recruitable companions, which might sound like a lot, but it pales in comparison to previous Baldur’s Gate titles. Adding more in a DLC would open up more interactions, stories, and variety for different play styles. A companion-based BG3 DLC could integrate existing NPCs and promote them to companions, or introduce new characters for people to get to know.





 7  Consequences For Fighting Auntie Ethel 
More Hags Means More Chaos
        

Auntie Ethel is a hag the party can run into twice in BG3, but despite Gandrel’s warnings about her coven seeking revenge, nothing ever comes of killing her, and the party continue in their efforts to save the world with no repercussions. Adding more hags to a DLC would be such chaotic fun as Ethel’s sisters come after the party. Even more chaos could be added if the hags whisked the party off to the Feywild to get their vengeance. Taking on one hag was difficult enough, but an entire coven is surely a challenge worthy of a DLC.
            
 
 Should You Help Auntie Ethel In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3? 
Auntie Ethel seems to be in some distress when first encountered in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but deciding whether to help her is a very complicated choice.








 6  The Upper City Of Baldur’s Gate 
Explore The Estates &amp; Delve Into Politics
        

One area that is only glimpsed in the final release of BG3 is the Upper City of Baldur’s Gate. The Upper City is home to the richer inhabitants of Baldur&#39;s Gate, and it would be fun to explore this affluent area and interact with the nobles and politicians who live there. An Upper City DLC could work well as the city will need to be rebuilt after the battle with the Elder Brain and, depending on choices made near BG3&#39;s ending, there could be a power vacuum at the heart of Baldur&#39;s Gate&#39;s rulers. Delving into the politics of the city and uncovering previously unknown villains would be a great addition to the story, as well as giving something a little different from more combat and monsters.





 5  Expand Minthara’s Story 
Giving The Drow Paladin A Better Three-Act Story


 







The companions of BG3 are complex and nuanced, realistic characters thanks to their well-written backstories. However, not all companions are created equally and while the main core of companions gets to shine during the course of BG3’s three-act story, one is left rather in the cold. Minthara does not benefit from a fully fleshed out personal quest like any of the other companions. In fact, once she is recruited, that seems to be it; although she has issues with Orin and wishes to see her defeated, this event takes place as part of the main plot.
            
 
 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: How To Recruit Minthara 
Thanks to a giant Patch 5, good-aligned Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players can now recruit Minthara. However, recruiting her involves some very specific steps.



Giving Minthara more attention would allow more people to get to know her better, rather than her being the default evil playthrough companion. Giving her a more substantial personal quest and delving into drow society would be fascinating and really allow Minthara to shine as a character. Although digging deeper into Minthara’s backstory and personality would not be enough for a DLC alone, including it as a part of any expansion would be welcome.





 4  Dealing With Astarion’s Vampirism 
Looking For A Cure Or Dealing With An Ascended Menace
        

Speaking of BG3 companions with fully fleshed out questlines, an intriguing idea for a DLC could revolve around Astarion. The plot could involve either seeking out a cure for him, allowing him to live in the daylight once more and starting his life over if he wished. Or, if Astarion ascended, dealing with the fallout of that decision. An ascended Astarion is noticeably darker and could easily slide into fully evil, so having the party have to face him would be very emotional. Perhaps he could be persuaded to stop his nefarious plans, or else the party will have to fight an ascended vampire.





 3  Helping Lae’zel Fight Vlaakith 
Aiding In The Liberation Of The Githyanki
        

Another companion whose story would benefit from a BG3 DLC is Lae’zel. There are many endings for Lae’zel, but if her personal quests were completed and the crèche visited, then she would probably be leading the fight against Vlaakith’s tyranny. It would be incredible to have a DLC that took the adventure into the Astral Sea to fight alongside githyanki. If Orpheus is alive, it would also be fascinating to see the reaction to his return, especially if he was the one to undergo the illithid transformation.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3 Players Are Still Missing Out On A Key Area 
At the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s first act, the party is told to choose between the Mountain Pass or the Underdark, but they can actually visit both.








 2  Finishing Off The Cult Of The Absolute 
Visiting Other Areas &amp; Cities On The Sword Coast


 







While the cult of the Absolute was focused on Baldur’s Gate in BG3, it would have made sense for them to have agents elsewhere along the Sword Coast. Although all the True Souls would have had their minds returned to them, if they weren’t transformed, there were still other members of the cult who didn’t have mind flayer parasites. A DLC with the party dealing with the remaining Absolute Cult in another city like Waterdeep or Neverwinter would make a great high-level adventure and allow more areas of the Sword Coast to be explored.





 1  Giving Karlach A Happy Ending 
Fixing Or Removing The Infernal Engine Once And For All
        

Karlach is a companion who everyone seems to love, and it breaks everybody&#39;s heart that there seems to be no fix for her infernal engine within Baldur’s Gate 3 currently. A perfect idea for a DLC would be a high level adventure, either in Avernus or on Faerûn, where the party reunite to seek out a permanent solution to Karlach’s problem. This could take the form of either fixing the engine or removing it, but giving Karlach a happy ending is surely at the top of many people’s lists.
