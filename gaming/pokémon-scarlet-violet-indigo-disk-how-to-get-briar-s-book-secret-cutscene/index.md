## Literature Review

Briar&#39;s Book is an item that players will receive after completing the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, but it has more use than it seems.





After Tarapagos is captured and the group heads out of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Area Zero, credits will begin to roll. Once the credits finish rolling, you will be notified that Briar is looking for you in one of the Blueberry Academy classrooms, where, after a short conversation, she will hand over her book about Area Zero that will be added to your inventory.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Terapagos In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC   Even though the Terapagos is a guaranteed catch in the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, you&#39;ll have to put up a worthy fight to obtain it.   


 What To Do With Briar&#39;s Book In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC 
         

Once the book is in hand, open up the map and switch to the Kitakami region, where the Teal Mask DLC occurred. If the Crystal Pool fly point has been unlocked, fast-travel there. If not, use the closest travel point to the top of the mountain and head there. Once at the top, you will come across a large pond with crystals underneath it. Ensure that Tarapagos is in your party before going any further; otherwise, this will not work.

Go to the point where a piece of land cuts into the pond, where you first encounter a Milotic in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Teal Mask DLC. Once there, toss out Tarapagos and give the game a minute to trigger the cutscene. If it doesn&#39;t immediately trigger, try moving around until it does. A thick mist will break out across the area if it has begun, and a mysterious figure will appear. Whether the stranger is Professor Sada or Turo varies depending on which version of the game, Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, you are playing.




                  Are Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Professors Sada &amp; Turo Named After Trees   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s professors, Sada and Turo, do not seem to be named after trees, which represents the new direction the games are taking.   

Let the cutscene play out and continue the conversation accordingly. Once the conversation ends, the Professor will ask you to exchange Briar&#39;s book for their own. Unfortunately, though the illusion of choice exists, there isn&#39;t a choice. If you decline to hand it over, they will insist until you agree. In exchange, you will receive either The Violet Book or The Scarlet Book, which is again dependent on the game&#39;s version.

Once the books are exchanged, the cutscene will end, and the mist will clear. Though it isn&#39;t much, it&#39;s an interesting little post-game cutscene that completionist players should check out. Once this concludes, there will be a new dialogue with Arven if you track him down. From there, you can engage in other post-game content, like speaking with Snacksworth to gather the locations of 25 different Legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.
