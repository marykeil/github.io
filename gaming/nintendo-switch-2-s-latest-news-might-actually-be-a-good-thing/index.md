# Nintendo Switch 2 s Latest News Might Actually Be A Good Thing


## SUMMARY 



  The Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be an iterative console, maintaining the design of the current system but adding some frills.   The Switch 2 needs to address the issue of graphics capability, as the current Switch struggles to handle multi-platform releases. A successor that modestly iterates on the original would be best for this concept.   The balance between home use and portability should be maintained in the Switch 2, and the price should not be raised dramatically. Trying to compete with PlayStation and Xbox at the same price point would alienate casual users and families.

## Literature Review

A recent update regarding the Switch 2 makes some ambitious expectations seem unlikely, but it actually points to a wise course of action.




The latest rumors about the Nintendo Switch successor have managed some expectations for what the console might be, but the picture that they paint of Nintendo&#39;s next venture isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. As the follow-up to a hit console, a potential Switch 2 has a lot to live up to, and avoiding a market disappointment like the Wii U is crucial. Nintendo hasn&#39;t generally been expected to reinvent the wheel with the successor, but that hasn&#39;t stopped discussion of ways that the company could leap into the future with its next system.




At the moment, it seems likely that the Switch 2 could release in 2024, which would place it comfortably in the middle of the current Xbox and PlayStation generational cycle like other recent Nintendo systems. It&#39;s been some years since Nintendo has tried to compete on the same playing field, instead aiming for a unique angle with interesting console features and more affordable price points. A Switch successor is obviously going to be more powerful than the original, but how favorably it might compare to Xbox and PlayStation capabilities has been the subject of some debate.


 The Switch 2 Will Likely Be Iterative – And That&#39;s Good 
          

Recent speculation on the upcoming Switch successor comes courtesy of a gamesindustry.biz round-up of analyst predictions for gaming in 2024, with Dr. Serkan Toto of the Japanese consultancy firm Kantan Games weighing in on system expectations. According to Dr. Toto, a Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to release at a $400 price point and &#34;be an iteration rather than a revolution,&#34; sticking to the overall design of the current console while possibly adding some frills. It&#39;s easy to run with this analysis as a negative indication of playing it too safely with the system, but this approach isn&#39;t a bad thing for consumers.




Although rumors of a &#34;Pro&#34; model for the original Nintendo Switch were a constant source of speculation for years (and Dr. Toto claims to know that such a product was once in development), the console ultimately skipped the mid-generation upgrade approach that Sony and Microsoft both employed. An iterative Switch 2 steps into the gap that a Pro model might have filled, maintaining what people love about the console while giving it the power that it needs to more comfortably run modern games. This ultimately answers a bigger demand than any other pipe dreams for a successor, leveraging Nintendo&#39;s strength in the current market while patching up the Switch&#39;s limitations.

                  Switch Pro Update Gives A  r Look At When The Switch 2 Will Arrive   Nintendo&#39;s presented its results for the end of its fiscal year and has given a better idea of when players can expect its next console to release.   



 The Switch&#39;s Graphics Have Become A Problem 
         




The fact that the Nintendo Switch is weaker than its competitors isn&#39;t a real issue, but the degree of separation has started to become one. When the Switch first launched, it was competing with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it beat the upgraded Xbox One X to the market. It was obvious that the internals of a $300 handheld weren&#39;t going to compare, but year-one titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 showed that it could wrangle some impressive feats at mostly manageable frame rates and resolution.

Considering the Switch&#39;s market relevance, however, multi-platform releases can be a big draw, and it doesn&#39;t really have the capability to handle many of them well in 2024. More recent games like Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy attempted Switch releases that were met with heavy criticism, as muddy graphics ultimately lost most or all of the visual appeal that they have on other platforms. Making a Switch successor the target for titles like these would be the easiest way to make sure that the final products live up to expectations, and a system that modestly iterates on the original works best for this concept.






 The Switch 2 Needs To Be An Affordable Hybrid Console 
          

The balance between home use and portability has been a huge part of the reason that companies are willing to attempt challenging ports to the system, as the Nintendo Switch has a player base and use case that doesn&#39;t fully overlap with other consoles. Altering this premise in any major ways would make it hard for the Switch 2 to recapture the same appeal and potentially cost both system sales and interest from developers. Nintendo isn&#39;t likely to make every future console follow in the mold of the Switch, but shaking things up already would be a waste of the strong position that the company currently holds.

It&#39;s also important that the push for better graphics doesn&#39;t raise the price by any overwhelming margin. Some fans would certainly be more than willing to spend $500 on a particularly beefy Switch 2, but trying to compete at the same price point as the disc-based PlayStation and Xbox models would alienate many casual users and families and make it a harder purchase to manage or justify across the board. Although Valve&#39;s Steam Deck has shown that there&#39;s certainly a market for more expensive handhelds, it&#39;s still a much smaller niche than the sphere that the Switch commands.






For those comfortable with the price point, many games do run better on the Steam Deck than the Switch, making it a reasonable option while waiting for a Switch successor.




According to reports of private Switch 2 demonstrations at Gamescom 2023, the console is apparently able to run The Matrix Awakens through Nvidia DLSS, which renders frames at a lower resolution and upscales them with AI to achieve a cleaner and sharper look. Assuming it&#39;s not pushing DLSS beyond its reasonable limits – a rendering and resolution gap that&#39;s too big ultimately becomes obvious – this means that the Switch 2 should be capable of running multi-platform games with graphics that look comparable to other systems with much more reasonable compromises than its predecessor. Achieving this at the $400 price point and the portable form factor could potentially be the perfect balance.

It&#39;s almost always fun when Nintendo rethinks what a console can be, but the Switch might be the company&#39;s best concept yet, and abandoning it too soon would be a mistake. A successor that sticks to the same basics is the perfect way to catch up with the current market while delivering a product that&#39;s sure to have fans, and if Nintendo can additionally leverage backward compatibility, it could also be the best option for playing games that already struggle on the Switch. The Switch 2 may not rock the world in the same way that the Nintendo Switch did, but it doesn&#39;t have to – it just has to be good.
