# What Poes Are For In Zelda Tears of the Kingdom


## SUMMARY 



  Poes are the most common collectible in Tears of the Kingdom, but the game doesn&#39;t outright specify how they can be used.   Poes are traded to Bargainer Statues, strange merchants that only deal in Poes, and can be found throughout Hyrule.   The Depths are littered with Poes, which respawn every Blood Moon and can be traded for unique armor sets, among other items.

## Literature Review

Poes are extremely common collectibles throughout TOTK’s Depths, but the game doesn’t explicitly state what players are supposed to use them for.




Poes are one of the most abundant collectibles in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and they can be especially useful if players only know what to do with them. Poes can be found scattered throughout the Depths, the underground area of TOTK&#39;s map. The Depths can be a harsh, unwelcoming place, requiring ample preparation, clever use of light sources, and an affinity for building vehicles with Zonai devices for exploration, but finding Poes is the easiest part. They&#39;re depicted as glowing, blue, teardrop-shaped wisps, so they stand out in the dark underground, even glowing enough to be seen in the pitch-black distance.




Players exploring TOTK&#39;s Depths in any capacity are likely to gather hundreds of these strange wisps, perhaps without even an inkling as to what they&#39;re good for. The use of Poes is actually rather straightforward, but the game doesn&#39;t explain what to do with them outright, and instead requires players to have interacted with some very unassuming NPCs they might not otherwise have noticed. Unless players thoroughly searched Lookout Landing early on, they may have overlooked the game&#39;s intended explanation for what Poes are used for.

                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   


 What To Do With Poes In TOTK 
          




Players can trade Poes with merchant NPCs called Bargainer Statues throughout Hyrule for a variety of rewards. Bargainer Statues are large, usually half-sunken carvings of humanoid creatures with four eyes, two noses, and a mouth. They also appear to be wearing conical caps that resemble the Gloom-resistant armor set that they sell, possibly implying that they were once intrepid explorers of the Depths themselves. They operate like any other store in TOTK, except the only currency they accept is Poes; Rupees are no good here. 



 Poe Rewards In TOTK 
         

Poes can be exchanged at Bargainer Statues for many useful items in Tears of the Kingdom, most of which will help Link against the challenges met in exploring the Depths. Each time Link finds a new Bargainer Statue, a further item will be added to the vendors&#39; inventories – once the new item is added, all Bargainer Statues will offer it. Link can also pay the Bargainer Statue at Lookout Landing 100 Poes to mark one of its brethren&#39;s locations in the Depths, which makes finding the remaining six much easier, if much more expensive. The following is a complete list of the Bargainer Statues&#39; inventory once all items are unlocked.




 Item  Price   Dark Clump  10 Poes   Muddle Bud  16 Poes   Puffshroom  16 Poes   Bomb Flower  16 Poes   Dark Hood  300 Poes   Dark Tunic  150 Poes   Dark Trousers  200 Poes   Hood of the Depths  300 Poes   Tunic of the Depths  150 Poes   Gaiters of the Depths  200 Poes   Tunic of Memories  200 Poes   





The cheaper, consumable items can also be found throughout Hyrule, mostly in the Depths, but all seven armor pieces sold by Bargainer Statues are unique to those merchants.







Of these, the most worthwhile rewards are certainly the three pieces that make up the Depths armor set: the Hood, the Tunic, and the Gaiters. Wearing even one piece of this set increases Link&#39;s resistance to Gloom, which otherwise decreases his maximum Heart Containers. As with many of TOTK&#39;s armor sets, it can be upgraded with the Great Fairies, and wearing the full, upgraded set confers an additional bonus against Gloom elemental attacks. The Dark Armor set gives Link a cool, edgy look, but provides a less practical movement speed boost at night. The Tunic of Memories is a callback to Breath of the Wild, being identical to that game&#39;s Chamion&#39;s Tunic, but it&#39;s not the most practical piece of armor.

Dark Clumps also confer a Gloom-resistant effect when cooked into food, so they can be useful while players save up for the more expensive Depths armor set. Muddle Buds can confuse enemies when thrown at them or attached to weapons, but they also grow naturally throughout TOTK&#39;s Depths, so spending Poes on them is a waste, unless players need to gather a lot of them quickly. The same goes for Puffshrooms, which blind enemies, and Bomb Flowers, which explode on impact and are the most common of the consumables offered by the Bargainer Statues.






 TOTK Bargainer Statue Locations 
          

The first Bargainer Statue most TOTK players will find is conveniently located in Lookout Landing, at the back of Josha&#39;s research headquarters near the double doors. This is the Bargainer Statue that is easiest to visit regularly; it&#39;s mere steps away from a fast travel point, and they can easily exchange Poes for goods while also turning in Korok Seeds, acquiring more Heart Containers or Stamina Vessels, or stocking up at Mubs&#39; shop.

                  Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom - All Bargainer Statue Locations   The Bargainer Statues in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom offer useful armor &amp; resources in exchange for Poes, but players first have to find these giants.   

The other six bargainer statues are all located in the Depths. The easiest way to find them is by paying the one at Lookout Landing 100 Poes to reveal each one&#39;s location. One is located on the lowest floor of the Great Abandoned Central Mine, which can be found during the TOTK quest &#34;A Call from the Depths.&#34; There are others at the Wellsprings of Wisdom, Power, and Courage, near the Usukaz Lightroot, Akinatanis Lightroot, and Muokuij Lightroot, respectively. TOTK also has a Bargainer Statue on the plains near the Stakijat Lightroot, and another on a cliff near the Yisuayam Lightroot.






Every Lightroot in the Depths is located directly beneath a Shrine of Light on the Surface, and the Lightroot&#39;s name is the same as the Shrine&#39;s spelled backwards.






 Where To Find Poes In TOTK 
          

Thanks to their natural glow, TOTK&#39;s Poes aren&#39;t too hard to find, even in the Depths. They usually gather in large groups, so players can scoop up a bunch of them quickly. However, players can find them even more easily by knowing exactly where to look. Groups of Poes often congregate near enemy outposts in the Depths; they can be found behind rock formations that shield them from monsters&#39; view.

TOTK players should also be on the lookout for Poes that appear larger than others, or ones that glow pink. These are called Large Poes and Grand Poes, and are worth five and 20 Poes respectively. These are usually found off the beaten path, like on top of the Depths&#39; fungus-like trees or in especially deep pits. The easiest way to find Poes of any type, however, is to gain some elevation by climbing, building a flying machine, or throwing a Hylian Pine Cone into a fire, and looking out for their wispy glow. Like all items, they respawn every time the Blood Moon rises, so players who want to maximize their Poe gains should plan for an excursion into the Depths every in-game week.




Getting all the Bargainer Statues&#39; rewards is no easy task; not only will players have to track the seven statues down, but they&#39;ll also have to gather 1,500 Poes to afford all of their items. That makes Poes the most plentiful collectible in TOTK, decisively beating even the numerous Korok Seeds. However, unlike other collectibles, Poes respawn and gather in groups, and their visual effects make them easier to find. They also have some of the most worthwhile rewards in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, so gathering Poes is far from a waste of time.
