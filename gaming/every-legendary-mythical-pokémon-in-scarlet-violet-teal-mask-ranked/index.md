## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s new DLC, The Teal Mask, introduces fun new powerful pocket monsters to the game, including the Teal Mask’s namesake.




The Teal Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet brings with it the introduction of some amazing and powerful new rare Pokémon to add to a Trainer&#39;s Pokédex, along with a clever story that ties many of these creatures together uniquely. This new excursion lets Trainers take a field trip to the region of Kitakami and is the first half of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, Scarlet and Violet&#39;s two-part DLC expansion. Kitakami is holding a festival at the time that Trainers enter the area that provides a perfect backdrop for exploring the location and researching the Pokémon that call it home.
So far, no Mythical Pokémon have been discovered in the Kitakami region&#39;s Pokédex, at least not ones that are obtainable in the wild. There are rumors about Pecharunt, originally called Dokutaro, but they haven&#39;t appeared yet. The Mythical Shaymin, Phione, and Manaphy are available in the game, but only by being transferred via Pokémon HOME. A few Legendary and Pseudo-Legendary-like Pokémon have been added in the recent DLC, including Ogerpon. A Legendary trio called the Loyal Three also make their debut in The Teal Mask DLC, described at one point as the Heroes of Kitakami, although this was later revealed to be much more complicated of a story than originally believed.
            
 
 Pokémon Teal Mask DLC Full Pokédex: Every Kitakami Pokémon Number &amp; Type 
The Kitakami Pokédex made available in Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC features 200 Pokémon. Here are all of them, their numbers, and their Types.












 








 5  Archaludon (Evolved Pseudo-Legendary) 
Steel/Dragon-Type
        

Archaludon is not a Legendary Pokémon, although its strength and capabilities could easily lead some Trainers to believe it is. Archaludon is the regional evolved form of the Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon, Duraludon. Though not a Legendary, Archaludon is a powerful Steel/Dragon-type Pokémon with a unique look. Like a robot from Transformers, Archaludon typically stands upright and has terminals at the ends of its limbs that gather static electricity to expel it at enemies. Archaludon can also change into a position where it is bent over and looks somewhat like a steel bridge, making it more stable and able to gather even more electricity, particularly in stormy weather.
            
 
 Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests 
In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.



A fun fact about Archaludon is that it is not considered a pseudo-Legendary, Legendary, or Mythical creature in the franchise, despite having 600 base stat points – which is usually what sets these monsters apart, like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and others. So far, Archaludon is the only Pokémon that reaches the stat requirements to be categorized as at least a pseudo-Legendary, but is not referred to as such. As registered by Bulbapedia, the Japanese Pokémon community has a unique group for it that can be translated as &#34;600 club.&#34; This is a reference to its base stat points and lack of an official category to insert it into.
Archaludon can only be obtained by evolving a Duraludon with Metal Alloy, an item that is part of the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet – in a sense, however, it is part of The Teal Mask by being inserted into the wider The Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack. 






 4  Okidogi (Legendary) 
Poison/Fighting-Type
        

Okidogi is one of the members of the Loyal Three alongside Munkidori and Fezandipiti. This dual Poison/Fighting-type Legendary is set as #197 in the Kitakami Pokédex for The Teal Mask DLC and is known for having a short temper. The Toxic Chain Ability, which is visually represented as a scarf-like appendage around its neck, caused Okidogi to transform and granted him powerful abilities. It has a canine appearance along with a Hidden Ability called Guard Dog, which prevents it from being forced to flee and raises its Attack by one stage whenever it is affected by Intimidate. Okidogi has a large, fluffy tail.
            
 
 Every New &amp; Returning Pokémon Added To Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Teal Mask DLC 
The Pokédex count for Generation 9’s Scarlet and Violet was increased with the new and returning Pokémon added with the Teal Mask expansion.



The creature stands on its two hind legs like a humanoid. Okidogi does not evolve, and the only known one of its kind is male. Like all other members of the Loyal Three Legendary Trio in the Teal Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it is rumored that this Legendary creature developed something of a bad attitude after being controlled by Pecharunt, a Mythical Poison-type Pokémon that is expected to have the power to control the minds of living beings.





 3  Munkidori (Legendary) 
Poison/Psychic-Type
        

The second member of the Loyal Three, Munkidori is a dual Poison- and Psychic-type Legendary. In the Kitakami Pokédex it is #198, although in the National Pokédex, it is listed at #1015. Like Okidogi, Munkidori is the only known one of his kind and does not evolve into or from another Pokémon. It is also strictly a male Pokémon for now. Munkidori is primate-like in appearance, with a Toxic Chain worn around its forehead as a headband, resembling the same chain around Okidogi&#39;s neck.
This chain stimulated Munkidori&#39;s brain and granted the Psychic-type abilities that he possesses. The chain is also rumored to be related to the Mythical Pecharunt. It prefers to protect itself by staying out of sight as much as possible during combat while using its paranormal powers to its advantage.





 2  Fezandipiti (Legendary) 
Poison/Fairy-type
        

The final member of the Loyal Three alongside Okidogi and Munkidori, Fezandipiti is a dual Poison- and Fairy-type Legendary Pokémon in the Kitakami region. This beautiful avian is listed as #1016 in the National Pokédex, though in the Kitakami-specific Pokédex for The Teal Mask, it is #199. The same Toxic Chain that Okidogi and Munkidori wear is seen on Fezandipiti as well, hanging around his chest similar to a type of shawl.
This chain transformed it by giving the creature a lovely voice and providing a special pheromone that is emitted each time Fezandipiti flaps its wings, which can be used to charm opponents and others around it while also providing poisonous gas. Fezandipiti is also believed to be under the influence of Pecharunt, the elusive Mythical Pokémon in The Teal Mask DLC.





 1  Ogerpon (Legendary) 
Grass-Type (Teal Mask), Grass/Water-Type (Wellspring Mask), Grass/Fire-Type (Hearthflame Mask), Grass/Rock-Type (Cornerstone Mask)


 







Ogerpon is the titular character of The Teal Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet and is actually called the Mask Pokémon by definition. It is a female Legendary Pokémon that does not evolve from or into any other. Ogerpon is listed as #1017 in the National Pokédex, and in the Kitakami region for The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, its regional Pokédex number is listed as #200. Ogerpon has four forms based on the mask it dons, with the Teal Mask being the traditional version. Its masks hold crystals that look similar to those located deep in Area Zero.
Ogerpon&#39;s four forms are distinguished by the mask that it is wearing, and each grants the Pokémon varying powers. With the traditional Teal Mask form, Ogerpon is a Grass-type Pokémon with the Defiant ability. It is a small humanoid-type creature with little leaves sprouting out between its toes. Each of its four masks and corresponding forms can also take on a unique Terastallized version. The table below lists some details about the other three masks that Ogerpon can equip, which alter its form and typing.
  Wellspring Mask   With the Wellspring Mask, Ogerpon becomes a Grass- and Water-type that is said to be able to stop the flow of a river.    Hearthflame Mask   The Hearthflame Mask gives Ogerpon the powers of a Grass- and Fire-type and is more aggressive than with other masks.    Cornerstone Mask   Ogerpon has Grass- and Rock-type abilities with the Cornerstone Mask, making her have strong defensive abilities and the power to break stones in two.    
Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Teal Mask was released on September 13, 2023, and is available now on the Nintendo Switch. Many other new Legendary and Paradox Pokémon were added to The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero in the second DLC to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet titled The Indigo Disk.
