## Literature Review

One of the strongest Perk-a-Cola recipes you can unlock in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is the Quick Revive, which lets you recover an ally much faster.





Certain story missions grant you rewards in the form of item Schematics, including the Quick Revive Perk-a-Cola recipe. As you attempt to mow down zombies and earn XP in Modern Warfare 3, you can meet optional goals tied to whatever operation you&#39;re involved with. The specific tasks tied to one contract must all be completed if you want to be able to make as many Quick Revives as you want.




                  &#34;Warfare That Feels Dated&#34; - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Review   Despite fantastic visuals, the campaign for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 fails to push the series forward with gameplay that feels dated.   


 How to Earn The Quick Revive Recipe in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

You can earn the Quick Revive recipe by completing &#34;The Chaperone&#34; mission and all its optional goals that show up in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. This quest asks you or your squad to protect a tank until it can close Aether portals along a set path. Hordes of undead will attack the vehicle as it travels as you desperately try to keep it intact enough to launch a rocket at the end of the mission.



You should be able to find &#34;The Chaperone&#34; contract after dropping into the Zombies map by finding an icon that looks like a small tank close to the Hadiqa Farms area.







The blueprint for Quick Revive is given as the highest reward when you defeat 75 enemies, complete the contract, and keep the ACV tank above 50% health by the end of the mission. The enemies must be killed during a single Escort Contract, which can be done in &#34;The Chaperone&#34; mission. This should be pretty easy, given the number of zombies to beat during this operation in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.

One of the best strategies to ensure the tank doesn&#39;t lose too much health is to always have one or more people close to it. It is far better to approach this mission with a squad rather than on your own so you can ensure the vehicle gets damaged less by zombies. Once you unlock the Quick Revive recipe, you can access it in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies through the Gear menu&#39;s crafting section anytime.
