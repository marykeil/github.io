## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 uses dice rolls for both combat and events outside of fighting. But some rolls are more important, especially in Honour Mode.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 uses dice rolls to determine more than the order of attacks, which strikes hit, and how much damage they deal. Combined with the right choices, a successful dice roll can help the party avoid entire battles. For an Honour Mode playthrough, skipping both boss and non-boss fights can be crucial to surviving.
At the center of every Dungeons and Dragons game is a set - or several sets - of polyhedral dice. With BG3 being based in the world of D&amp;D and importing some of its features into the game, it&#39;s not surprising that rolling dice is often used to determine the outcome of important decisions. But there are certain rolls that defeat bosses without a fight, and those become particularly useful in Honour Mode.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3: Should You Turn Karmic Dice On Or Off? 
Karmic Dice are enabled by default in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but leaving this particular box checked might not be the best decision for every campaign.












 








 10  Deceiving Lump 
Earning Lump&#39;s War Horn
        

Lump is an unusually intelligent ogre in the Goblin Camp of Act 3, and he seems to be the leader of the ogre trio tucked inside one of the ruined houses. Tav has the option to make a dice roll and recruit Lump&#39;s help in a future battle, promising to pay the ogres a thousand gold after they participate in a fight. This results in two main benefits. The first is having allies as a backup plan since they can be summoned almost anywhere in Act 1 to help. And the second benefit is the ability to call the ogres for help and let them die in battle. That way, Tav can also grab Lump&#39;s headpiece as an added bonus.
            
 
 10 Essential Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Spells For Complete Beginners 
There are some amazing low level spells that those new to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 should keep an eye out for when picking their classes and spells.








 9  Astarion Bites Tav 
Limiting The Debuff


 







If Tav lets Astarion bite them during the cutscene where his nature as a Vampire Spawn is revealed, then there&#39;s a set of saving rolls, and they need to succeed on one to keep him from killing them. While having the Bloodless effect isn&#39;t great on Honour Mode, it&#39;s easier to deal with than Tav dying. In the event of death, the party will need to use resources like a spell slot or scroll to revive them, and then either use more spells and healing items to get their health up or waste Camp Supplies for a Long Rest.





 8  Saving Arabella 
Act 1 Druid Grove
        

The party&#39;s first introduction to Kagha is when she&#39;s about to let her snake bite Arabella as punishment for attempting to steal the Sacred Idol. Tav has a few options for what ability they can use on their roll to try saving Arabella if that&#39;s the path they want to take in that run. Without save scumming, this can be a tough task in Honour Mode. However, keeping her alive and helping her again in Act 3 means that the party can get a passive buff from her in the final battle via Gather Your Allies.





 7  Zaith&#39;isk Saves 
Act 1 Mountain Pass
        

The Zaith&#39;isk is a device in the Githyanki Crèche that&#39;s meant to remove Illithid parasites. If Tav decides to go into the device, then they need to pass a series of saving throws to avoid getting a permanent debuff. Additionally, passing all the saving throws gives Tav the Awakened buff instead, letting them use Illithid powers as Bonus Actions.
            
 
 10 Regrettable Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Honour Mode Decisions 
Honour Mode comes with the threat of permanent death in Baldur’s Gate 3 if the party is wiped out. And these decisions will give you a game over.








 6  Malus Thorm 
House Of Healing


 







Malus Thorm holds the Battered Lute that&#39;s used to wake up Art for Halsin&#39;s quest. However, his fight isn&#39;t easy, and it features quite a few strong adds, which is a bad combination when playing in Honour Mode in particular. But if the party passes a series of dice rolls to persuade him, Malus Thorm can be killed by his assistants for the sake of their practice, resulting in the fight being skipped completely.
            
 
 10 Things In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Honour Mode That Make The Game Way Harder 
Patch 5 of Baldur’s Gate 3 adds an extra-hard difficulty setting called Honour Mode. Here are some things it changes to make the game more punishing.








 5  Gerringothe Thorm 
The Counting House
        

Another member of the Thorm family, Gerringothe Thorm can also be skipped by choosing the right set of dialogue and passing the associated dice rolls. She isn&#39;t a required boss, but defeating her means the party can loot the Counting House and get a decent chunk of gold, which is great for Honour Mode where prices are different. Otherwise, fighting her can be dangerous, especially if the party is carrying a lot of gold with them.





 4  Yurgir The Orthon 
Guantlet Of Shar
        

Facing Yurgir is part of Astarion&#39;s quest, and the party has a few options about how to deal with him. The first is to help him break his contract, the second is to kill him, and the third is to convince him to kill himself. Naturally, the third option is the best in Honour Mode because his fight starts with the party in an unfavorable position and surrounded by enemies, but it requires passing the dice rolls that convince him to kill his minions and himself.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.








 3  Yurgir In Act 3 
House Of Hope
        

Yurgir&#39;s death in Act 2 means that the party will come across him again in Act 3 when they&#39;re about to face Raphael in the House of Hope. However, just like the first time, Yurgir can be convinced with a successful dice roll not to fight the group. Instead, they&#39;ll get him to join them against Raphael, and keeping him alive through this fight makes him available for the &#34;Gather Your Allies&#34; quest leading to the final battle.





 2  Steel Watchers 
After Committing A Crime
        

If the party is seen committing a crime before disabling the Steel Watch in BG3, they&#39;ll have to pass a dice roll to convince the Steel Watchers they encounter that they&#39;re innocent. Failing this roll isn&#39;t necessarily deadly, but it can become deadly. The party is arrested, and that means they&#39;ll need to fight their way out of prison, which can use resources that could&#39;ve been saved or result in dying if the battle rolls don&#39;t go well.





 1  Ketheric Thorm 
In The Mind Flayer Colony


 







The second fight with Ketheric Thorm in the Mind Flayer Colony can be skipped, letting the party get straight to fighting the Apostle of Myrkul instead. This is done by successfully passing dice checks to convince Ketheric that he needs to repent for his sins, leading to him casting himself into the chasm. While it doesn&#39;t skip the fight that immediately follows, it helps in Honour Mode to have the party&#39;s full resources available for the second phase.
There are a lot of dice rolls that the party needs to make throughout BG3, but some are much more important than others. And, when playing Honour Mode, being able to use dice rolls to either skip battles or make them easier can be the deciding factor in whether the run ends or not. Given how many rolls can be used to skip bosses, it seems that talking is generally a better idea than fighting in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
