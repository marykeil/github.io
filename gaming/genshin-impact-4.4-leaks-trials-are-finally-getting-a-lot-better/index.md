## Literature Review

Leaks indicate a small update to character trials in Genshin Impact 4.4, which may end up being a game-changing decision for players in the future.




A new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak hints at a much-needed update to trial characters, which may significantly improve how players test out the characters featured in each banner. Ahead of the upcoming patch, HoYoverse’s popular RPG has been heavily hit by leaks, revealing a grand portion of the next pieces of content. This goes from new characters, like Gaming and Xianyun in Genshin Impact 4.4, which were confirmed after some leaks, to the description of new areas, a new god, and even some new celebratory skins for beloved characters from Liyue. While new content tends to be in the spotlight, the leaks also feature some quality-of-life updates.




Among the quality-of-life updates that have been leaked so far, there is one that addresses trial characters. Currently, whenever a character is featured with increased drop rates in a banner, they will be made available to play with within a short trial session. This allows players to better understand that character’s abilities and how they work with other playable heroes in the game, especially considering how a large portion of it revolves around team comps. This is true for both 4-star and 5-star heroes in Genshin Impact. According to new Version 4.4 leaks, this experience will be improved and may pave the way for further enhancements.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream - Date, Time, &amp; What To Expect   The special livestream program for Genshin Impact&#39;s Version 4.4 should be occurring soon, as the game progresses further into Version 4.3.   


 Xiao’s Trial Team Comp In Genshin Impact Is Changing (For The Better) 
         




A post made by the user HomDGCat on Reddit suggests that the next update will alter the team comp offered with Xiao’s trial session. Up to now, as of his last appearance in Version 3.4, Xiao was featured alongside Barbara, which could heal him through the HP-loss mechanic present in his Elemental Burst and any eventual damage from opponents. As of Version 4.4, however, the leaks mention that Xiao will now be accompanied by Sucrose, Bennett, and Faruzan. This is a significant change to his trial team comp and one that can easily be perceived as an improvement when considering how players usually use Xiao in Genshin Impact.



 Update To Xiao’s Trial Team In Genshin Impact Is Good News 
          

The update that Xiao is getting to his trial teams whenever he is featured in limited-time character banners is very good news. While putting him alongside only Barbara was a good way of thrusting him into the spotlight, with the 4-star Hydro unit there to merely heal him with off-field abilities, it did not push him to his limit or really showcase all of his potential as a main DPS character. Because of the importance of team comps in Genshin Impact, simply putting a DPS with a healer limits the DPS’ damage output and is an unreal representation of how he would be used under normal circumstances.




The alleged shift to the team comp with Sucrose, Bennett, and Faruzan is a much more realistic approach to what a team comp with Xiao would look like. Of course, no other 5-star heroes are featured in trial teams as a way of allowing that specific character to be in the spotlight. Nevertheless, this new team comp for Xiao’s trial was carefully put together. Sucrose is a great support unit for Xiao, as she not only activates Anemo Resonance in Genshin Impact and provides Energy Restoration but also gathers enemies together, allowing Xiao’s concentrated attacks to hit multiple enemies at once.

Adding Bennett as the healer for this team comp instead of Barbara is also a great decision. Even after dozens of releases, Bennett is, arguably, still the best 4-star character in Genshin Impact and can provide more consistent and continuous off-field healing to Xiao, when compared to Barbara. In addition to that, he can also spread Pyro DMG to enemies, an element that Xiao can swirl with his Anemo-based attacks for increased damage output.






Of course, depending on the player’s rotation, Sucrose and Faruzan will also be triggering the Swirl reaction with their own abilities, even if that is not their initial intention.




Faruzan is the last addition to Xiao’s trial team comp and a key character at that. This is one of the best characters to go along with Xiao because she is a support unit that serves a very unique purpose: lowering enemies’ resistance against Anemo DMG. In turn, this will allow Xiao to deal a lot more damage when battling. Faruzan is one of the most underrated 4-star characters in the game, but having her in a team comp with an Anemo DPS like Xiao or Wanderer in Genshin Impact can be game-changing, and putting her in Xiao’s trial team is a great way of showcasing that.

In conclusion, pairing him up with Barbara was underselling Xiao’s value as a DPS. Even though it did offer the trial player more time with the character, which in turn allowed them to get a better gist of his abilities, it undermined his powers. High damage output and the continuous usage of his Elemental Burst are vital to the core experience of playing with Xiao in Genshin Impact. As such, adapting the trial team around him to increase the damage counters he raises with every hit and allow him to Burst more often for even higher numbers is a great move.






 Xiao’s Updated Trial Team May Pave A New Future For Genshin Impact 
          

At first glance, this update to Xiao’s trial team may seem like something very specific to the character himself, but it may be a further indication of a brighter future for trial characters in general. Most older characters have outdated trial teams that do showcase the featured character, but not at their prime potential. Depending on how some older trial teams are structured, it is not so evident what a character does and what their role in a team comp is. With more updated trial teams in Genshin Impact, this could make it easier to understand the featured character’s abilities and how they work around a realistic party.

Moving forward, 5-star characters’ abilities can be better showcased within trial domains, all due to a solid team comp that reflects what players would actually use. In turn, this could make it more clear for players who are deciding whether or not to invest their Primogems into a certain character during their time in a limited banner. Even though it is a minor change, it is an important one, as it can affect how players spend their money. Quality-of-life updates in Genshin Impact are getting special treatment recently and, hopefully, that will continue to be the case in the future.
