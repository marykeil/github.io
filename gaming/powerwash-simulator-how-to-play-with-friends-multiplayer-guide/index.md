## Literature Review

Now players can join together in multiplayer to tackle jobs and wash away grime in PowerWash Simulator&#39;s cross-platform play mode.





Every job in PowerWash Simulator can be tackled in single-player, but even seemingly simple jobs, such as cleaning a playground, can involve tracking down tough-to-reach spots where dirt and muck build up. Later, the game features extremely odd gigs, such as cleaning a secret hatch on the surface of Mars, and some of these jobs can be truly gigantic in scale. Playing with friends in co-op makes for faster, more efficient cleaning.




                  PowerWash Simulator &amp; The Satisfaction Of Digital Cleaning   PowerWash Simulator and similar games centered on the satisfaction of digital cleaning provide a unique form of relaxation that some consider odd.   


 How To Setup Co-Op Multiplayer In PowerWash Simulator 
          

Co-op multiplayer is available in all modes, apart from Challenge Mode. To set it up, start a cleaning job and open up your in-game tablet. You may have already used the tablet to track your income and purchase cleaning supplies. From there, toggle co-op using the switch in the top left corner of the screen. 

There are two options: Friends Only and Crossplay. If you set it to Friends Only, your friends on the same platform will be able to join your game by selecting Join A Player&#39;s Co-Op Game in the top right corner. This opens a menu where you can join anyone in your friends list. Of course, you and your friends might not all share the same platform, so you may need to set up crossplay instead.






PowerWash Simulator has some limits on how many players can join sessions. Career Mode jobs are limited to 2 players, while Bonus Jobs and Free Play have a maximum of 6 players per lobby.






 How To Setup Crossplay Multiplayer In PowerWash Simulator 
          

To play with your friends across different platforms, toggle co-op on and set the option to Crossplay. Select Invite Friend, which will open a new pop-up with a seven-digit Room Code. Copy this down and give it to your friends.

To join a cross-platform game, select Join A Player&#39;s Co-Op Game and enter the Room Code under the Cross-Platform Play tab. You can then join the lobby and start cleaning. Customizing your PowerWash Simulator avatar&#39;s clothes is highly recommended as soon as you&#39;ve got the cash to spare, as you can then tell your friends apart at a glance.




Unfortunately, there&#39;s no guide on how to convince your friends to join you for some virtual cleaning. However, the game is surprisingly relaxing, a quality that made PowerWash Simulator a GOTY contender. Once you convince some friends to help, setting up multiplayer sessions isn&#39;t too difficult.
