## Literature Review

A Special Illustration Rare card from the Shiny Treasure ex subset for Pokémon TCG has allegedly leaked, featuring a gorgeous Shiny Mew.




A new Shiny Mew card from Pokémon TCG’s Shiny Treasure ex has allegedly leaked, and it may be the most adorable illustration of the Mythical Pokémon so far. The new Shiny Treasure ex set is due to arrive in a few months and is expected to officially land in late January. The expansion to Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet will, as indicated by the name, be focused on Shiny versions of regular Pokémon – much like the Shining Fates set was to the Sword and Shield collection.




Other than its main focus, very little is known about the upcoming expansion – in fact, Shiny Treasure ex is its Japanese name, and it may not even arrive in the West with that title. It is considered a subset rather than a full expansion like Pokémon TCG’s Paradox Rift. Nevertheless, it seems like the first leaks regarding the Shiny Treasure ex set have commenced, and an adorable Shiny Mew card is at the forefront.

                  The 12 Most Expensive Pokémon Cards Of All-Time, Ranked   2021 saw a renewed surge of interest in the game and its cards, which resulted in the cards&#39; value skyrocketing to well above thousands of dollars.     


 Shiny Mew Card From Pokémon TCG Has Leaked 
          

As seen in a post made by user dmorgn on Reddit, the Special Illustration Rare (SIR) Shiny Mew card from the Shiny Treasure ex set has leaked ahead of its release. In addition to that, it is not even the Japanese version of the card, which is due to arrive on December 1, but the English version, which is expected to be released on January 26, 2024. The leaked Pokémon TCG card features a delicate blue Mew surrounded by other Pokémon, like Oddish and Rattata, in an illustration that was allegedly made by USGMEN.






 Pokémon TCG Leaks Should Be Taken With A Grain Of Salt 
          

Despite the overall excitement demonstrated by fans in the replies to the Reddit post, this leak should be taken with a grain of salt. That is not to say that the Pokémon TCG leak is not true but, as of now, there are no ways of verifying the accuracy of the information. The strongest lead to pursue so far is analyzing the Shiny Mew card’s art style and comparing it to other works by USGMEN. That gives the leak a little more credibility but is still far from being a confirmation.

                  15 Most Powerful Pokémon Cards Of All Time   There are well over 15,000 different Pokémon cards released since the TCG debuted, but some definitely stand out as the most powerful.    

Pokémon TCG leaks were more consistent and reliable a few years ago, but have cooled off during the past year. If the Shiny Treasure ex card leak is, in fact, true, this could mean a new wave of believable leaks coming soon. Additionally, if it is a true leak, the Special Illustration Rare Shiny Mew will likely be one of the most coveted Pokémon TCG cards in the near future, perhaps worth dozens of dollars.
