  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Elden Ring
is a critically-acclaimed title known for, among other things, a number of very difficult boss fights.
The game&rsquo;s expansion,
Shadow of the Erdtree
, is highly anticipated and likely to introduce even more challenging bosses.
Most of
Elden Ring
&rsquo;s hardest bosses are some of the more famous characters in the Lands Between, but hidden or secret bosses, as well as some boss duos also qualify.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From the legendary Maliketh to the infamous Malenia, Blade of Miquella, these are by far the most difficult bosses to fight in Elden Ring.</p>
<p>Developed by FromSoftware, Elden Ring is a critically-acclaimed title that is effectively a successor to the Dark Souls series, inheriting many of its signature features, including the developer&rsquo;s penchant for difficult boss fights. Created in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, a high fantasy author most famous for A Song of Ice and Fire, Elden Ring is known for its deep RPG systems, fascinating open world, nebulous story, and – perhaps most of all – its difficulty. As with many of FromSoftware&rsquo;s most recent offerings, there are plenty of hard boss fights to be found.
FromSoftware&rsquo;s Elden Ring finally arrived in February 2022 after years of speculation and hype, a lead-up that seems to be repeating itself with the long wait for the release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring&rsquo;s still-mysterious expansion. If prior FromSoftware DLCs are any indication, Shadow of the Erdtree is likely to introduce the game&rsquo;s most difficult bosses. While many would welcome the new challenge, the idea is daunting, as Elden Ring already has a slew of punishing fights. With consideration for where they appear in the base game, below are the 15 hardest bosses players can encounter in Elden Ring.</p>
<p>Best Elden Ring Builds To Help You Beat The Hardest Bosses
Technically, Elden Ring doesn&rsquo;t have an easy mode. That said, there are several character builds you can create to make certain boss fights easier.</p>
<p>15  Margit, The Fell Omen
Stormveil Castle</p>
<p>The first main boss most Elden Ring players will likely face is Margit, the Fell Omen, who guards the entrance to Stormveil Castle and essentially demands that new players hone their skills in order to continue on – a skill check prior to entering the game&rsquo;s first Legacy Dungeon. While it&rsquo;s technically possible to bypass Margit, defeating him is required to face Godrick the Grafted, one of the game&rsquo;s easier demigods, two of which are required to enter Leyndell, Royal Capital.
Margit, the Fell Omen, may not technically be the most difficult boss in Elden Ring, but given how early on he is encountered, he can certainly be pretty tough. The most challenging aspect of his boss fight is a number of delayed attack patterns, maneuvers wtih tricky timing that many later bosses in the game utilize as well.</p>
<p>14  Rennala, Queen Of The Full Moon
Academy Of Raya Lucaria</p>
<p>The Elden Ring boss presiding over Liurnia of the Lakes, Rennala, is the ex-wife of Radagon, and remains exiled in her home at Raya Lucaria Academy. Her first phase – which is reminiscent of the Deacons of the Deep, one of Dark Souls 3&rsquo;s easiest bosses – isn&rsquo;t particularly strenuous, but beating Rennala requires navigating her tricky second phase.
Set upon an illusory lake, Rennala is now capable of firing damaging beams of magic and summoning imposing ethereal monsters to fight alongside her. Though this Elden Ring boss is certainly not scaled for end-game builds, when encountered at the appropriate level, she can make for a major headache. Rennala&rsquo;s summoned companions make up most of the difficulty, requiring players to fight multiple enemies at once, while simultaneously dodging magical barrages.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: We Finally Know What&rsquo;s Inside Rennala&rsquo;s Egg, &amp; It&rsquo;s Gross
Elden Ring boss Queen Rennala carries a strange amber egg, and now a renowned dataminer has uncovered the egg’s truly disturbing contents.</p>
<p>13  Morgott, The Omen King
Leyndell, Royal Capital</p>
<p>Morgott, the Omen King, is technically a sequel to the fight against the Margit, the Fell Omen (Morgott&rsquo;s alter ego). However, Morgott is even more powerful now than before, holding nothing back in a last-ditch effort to defend the mighty Erdtree from the Tarnished. Morgott fights with a frenetic and hostile nature and can fire magic arrows that will rain down for a pretty long time. He&rsquo;s much more aggressive in his second phase when he starts utilizing a unique weapon art. His attacks in the second phase may be very hard to memorize and dodge, but as is the case with most Elden Ring bosses, staying aggressive is the key to victory.</p>
<p>12  Astel, Stars Of Darkness
Yelough Anix Tunnel</p>
<p>There are two fights against Astel in Elden Ring, the first against Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, and the second against Astel, Stars of Darkness. Naturalborn of the Void is the final hurdle in Ranni the Witch&rsquo;s questline, but Stars of Darkness appears later in the game, has more HP, and an additional attack. Astel has plenty of magical spells under its belt, and it&rsquo;s capable of launching meteorites, casting gravity magic, and even teleporting. Anyone who gets close to this beast will be ravaged by a shockwave, but keep some distance, and the Elden Ring boss will fire a damaging laser beam. With these moves, players will have to battle this creature both at close range and from a distance.</p>
<p>11  Commander Niall
Castle Sol</p>
<p>The final barrier between the player and Miquella&rsquo;s Haligtree, Commander Niall, is a tough Elden Ring boss made all the more difficult by the fact that he summons two soldiers to aid in the fight. Once they are dispatched – a feat that requires the player to balance three enemies at a time – Commander Niall unleashes some devastating lightning and frost attacks that cover large areas, and dodging them requires some serious precision. Ultimately, Elden Ring&rsquo;s Commander Niall isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as tough as what&rsquo;s waiting for the player beneath the Haligtree, but he serves as a suitable blockade for those foolish enough to pursue Elden Ring&rsquo;s actual hardest boss.</p>
<p>10  Draconic Tree Sentinel
Capital Outskirts</p>
<p>Players will encounter the Tree Sentinels multiple times throughout their adventures in Elden Ring&rsquo;s Lands Between, but while the most infamous fight stands just outside the game&rsquo;s tutorial area, another particularly fearsome Elden Ring boss guards the back entrance to Leyndell, Royal Capital. Found before a fog gate, the Draconic Tree Sentinel is typically a massive challenge relative to almost anything that&rsquo;s come before. Agile, tough to hit, and capable of launching lighting strikes that require almost frame-perfect precision, the Draconic Tree Sentinel boss fight represents a serious barrier to progression, playing a similar role to Margit.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: How To Beat The Draconic Tree Sentinel (Leyndell)
To defeat the Draconic Tree Sentinel guarding Leyndell in Elden Ring, Tarnished must &ldquo;respect&rdquo; the Field Boss&rsquo;s unique ability to cast ranged attacks.</p>
<p>9  Radagon Of The Golden Order
Inside The Erdtree</p>
<p>Radagon happens to be the first half of Elden Ring&rsquo;s two-stage final boss fight alongside the Elden Beast. Radagon&rsquo;s short-ranged melee attacks may seem simple for the most part, but they&rsquo;re also very strong and can give players a headache. In addition to those melee moves, Radagon can also fire beam projectiles and pull off slam moves, and his attacks are often as difficult to withstand as they are to dodge.
It seems a bit counterintuitive that Radagon would be more difficult than the Elden Beast (which doesn&rsquo;t even crack the top 15), but the latter has attacks that are much easier to dodge, even if the fight does generally take longer. Radagon leaves very little room for error, and punishes mistakes with tremendous damage and devastating combos.</p>
<p>8  Mohg, Lord Of Blood
Mohgwyn Palace</p>
<p>Elden Ring&rsquo;s Mogh boss is fairly out of the way, and those who don&rsquo;t seek out Varre or venture across the Consecrated Snowfields likely won&rsquo;t find him. He utilizes magical spells that can be easily dodged, but they deal an incredible amount of damage when they connect. It&rsquo;s not until his health is half depleted that he kicks things into high gear and casts an unblockable blood spell across the screen. Mogh takes on a winged form in the second phase of the fight, giving him more speed. Moreover, his attacks can cover more ground. He&rsquo;s certainly not the most difficult optional boss in Elden Ring, and there are ways to cheese the Mohg fight, but those who seek him out legitimately ought to be prepared for a fight.</p>
<p>7  Crucible Knight Ordovis &amp; Crucible Tree Knight
Auriza Hero&rsquo;s Grave</p>
<p>FromSoftware is no stranger to having dual bosses, and Elden Ring&rsquo;s Crucible Knight and Crucible Knight Ordovis stand among the studio&rsquo;s more infamous. The pair is an optional boss fight, but anyone who challenges these two in Auriza Hero&rsquo;s Grave will be in for a hard time. The knights fight rather aggressively, and open their wings in the second phase and charge at the player constantly. Given how aggressive Elden Ring&rsquo;s Crucible Knight bosses are, countering them by playing passive is the safest bet there is, and using Spirit Ashes or summoning co-op partners is almost a requirement to even the odds.</p>
<p>6  Godskin Duo
Crumbling Farum Azula</p>
<p>Dealing with the Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble Elden Ring bosses individually can be irritating enough, but dealing with them both in the same fight can make for a terrible experience. In fact, it is arguable that these two are among the most reviled bosses in all of FromSoftware&rsquo;s catalog. Both the Apostle and Noble are very fast, and their speed kicks up a notch when they enter their second phase. They can both shoot projectiles, meaning they often engage the player from different ranges. Worst of all, these Elden Ring bosses must be fought multiple times, as they&rsquo;ll continually resurrect until their whole health bar is completely depleted.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: How To Beat The Godskin Duo
Defeating Elden Ring&rsquo;s Godskin Duo is a daunting task, but with careful timing, proper use of the environment, and a little luck, it can be done.</p>
<p>5  Godfrey, First Elden Lord
Leyndell, Ashen Capital</p>
<p>Godfrey became the first Tarnished after being exiled from the Lands Between, but he returns to the Ashen Capital when the player is on the brink of toppling the Golden Order. He is very aggressive in his boss fight, wielding a battleaxe that can deal tons of damage. In his first phase, the Elden Ring boss moves slowly, but his cadence can make him tough to track, and he frequently produces debilitating shock waves by stomping the ground.
Godfrey&rsquo;s second phase sees him reverting to his alter ego, Hoarah Loux, Warrior, a title previously held when he conquered the giants, prior to becoming First Elden Lord. To do this, Godfrey removes Serosh, the Lord of Beasts, from his back, who was suppressing Godfrey&rsquo;s bloodlust so he could act according to his lordship. Now shirtless and coated in blood, Hoarah Loux shirks his axe, fighting bare-fisted and even more aggressive. Outclassing Radagon, Godfrey is the toughest boss in Elden Ring&rsquo;s final stretch.</p>
<p>4  Starscourge Radahn
Caelid</p>
<p>Starscourge Radahn, his mind deteriorated by the Scarlet Rot inflicted upon him by Malenia prior Elden Ring, is one of the game&rsquo;s more daunting boss battles, but fighting him doesn&rsquo;t have to be a solo effort. The fight with him functions as more of a raid, as up to seven Elden Ring NPCs can be summoned by the player to take this massive foe down – and each can be resummoned if they fall in battle. While being joined by a team of seven warriors seems like it can make the fight easier, it sadly doesn&rsquo;t. Radahn&rsquo;s huge size gives his attacks massive hitboxes that are very difficult to dodge, and although allies can take the heat off of the player, they don&rsquo;t inflict a tremendous amount of damage.</p>
<p>Elden Ring DLC Could Show The Consequences Of Radahn’s Boss Fight
Radahn is one of Elden Ring&rsquo;s most powerful characters, helping protect the world from cosmic threats. The DLC could show the effects of his defeat.</p>
<p>3  Dragonlord Placidusax
Crumbling Farum Azula</p>
<p>A secret boss encountered only by diligent players in Crumbling Farum Azula, Dragonlord Placidusax has to be the hardest of Elden Ring&rsquo;s many boss dragon enemies. An ancient, towering beast that boasts massive, punishing AoE attacks, this is a tough fight that&rsquo;s overshadowed only by the final boss of Crumbling Farum Azula. Able to fly, teleport, and perform intimidating diving attacks that can be difficult to avoid, Dragonlord Placidusax is a worthy end-game Elden Ring boss and can be truly dangerous for characters either slightly under-leveled for late-game areas, or with unoptimized builds.</p>
<p>2  Maliketh, The Black Blade
Crumbling Farum Azula</p>
<p>Maliketh is a two-part Elden Ring boss battle that takes place at the end of the Crumbling Farum Azula. The first part involves Maliketh&rsquo;s alter ego, the Beast Clergymen Gurranq, a giant creature with a penchant for firing projectiles and using a lot of area-of-effect attacks. Once the player gets the beast&rsquo;s health down to around fifty percent, Gurranq is revealed to actually be Elden Ring&rsquo;s Maliketh, the Black Blade, and Shadowbound Beast of Queen Marika. Maliketh&rsquo;s prowess extends to Elden Ring lore; he defeated the Gloam-Eyed Queen, the mysterious leader of the Godskin Apostles.
Maliketh is much more violent and agile than in the Beast Clergyman phase; he moves around the stage belligerently, unleashing combos that, even if dodged perfectly, can sap a player&rsquo;s entire stamina bar. Additionally, he&rsquo;s able to launch devastating arched projectiles and close the gap between himself and the player almost instantly. Crumbling Farum Azula is arguably the most difficult region in Elden Ring, with Maliketh capping off a grueling set of bosses that includes the Godskin Duo and Dragonlord Placidusax.</p>
<p>1  Malenia, Blade Of Miquella
Elphael, Brace Of The Haligtree</p>
<p>Found at the bottom of the Haligtree, another long and incredibly taxing area, is Malenia, Elden Ring&rsquo;s hardest boss. Her reputation puts her in the highest echelon of difficult FromSoftware bosses alongside Bloodborne&rsquo;s Orphan of Kos and Dark Souls 3&rsquo;s Sister Friede. Malenia not only crushes players who challenge her, but devastated the entire region of Caelid, turning it into the wasteland seen in Elden Ring, by unleashing the Scarlet Rot in a duel against Radahn during The Shattering.
Malenia&rsquo;s first phase is tough, yet manageable; it&rsquo;s her second phase, in which she&rsquo;s transformed into Malenia, Goddess of Rot, that is harrowing. Lightning-fast combos, massive AoE attacks, an onslaught of phantom clones, and the near-inescapable Scarlet Rot combine for a whirlwind of punishing attacks. Worst of all, she has the ability to leech health from the player with every hit she lands, which means that some Spirit Ash summons will do more harm than good. Malenia may be an optional boss (just as the entire Haligtree is an optional area), but that doesn&rsquo;t stop her from being the hardest boss fight in Elden Ring.</p>
