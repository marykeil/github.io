# Face It, You ll Never Get To Play The Last Of Us Multiplayer Again


## SUMMARY 



  Naughty Dog has canceled its standalone multiplayer The Last of Us game, known internally as The Last of Us Online.   TLOU Online would have required significant post-launch support because of its nature as a live-service project.   Because of Naughty Dog&#39;s resources, and the landscape of modern multiplayer games, it&#39;s possible there may never be another TLOU multiplayer game again.

## Literature Review

The Last of Us Online has officially been canceled by Naughty Dog, and it has unfortunate implications for the franchise’s multiplayer future.




Naughty Dog&#39;s seemingly ambitious plans for a standalone multiplayer The Last of Us game have fallen through, and it unfortunately may spell the end of such projects indefinitely. The live-service multiplayer game, originally planned as a component of The Last of Us Part 2, had already been announced, though very little was still known about its gameplay. As a potential successor to the original TLOU&#39;s Factions multiplayer mode, and considering Naughty Dog&#39;s pedigree, the game had a substantial amount of promise, but its cancelation may now signal the end of the franchise&#39;s multiplayer ventures altogether.




Although the studio cut its teeth on Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, Naughty Dog has risen to PlayStation Studios preeminence on the back of Uncharted and The Last of Us. Both are celebrated for their cinematic flair and rich character development, but neither are strangers to humble, yet compelling multiplayer offerings. Multiple Uncharted titles included rather run-of-the-mill, yet still fun, versus and cooperative multiplayer modes, but The Last of Us&#39; Factions had fascinating metaprogression that never quite reached its potential. Unfortunately, with what Naughty Dog refers to as The Last of Us Online now canceled, that potential may never be ultimately realized.

                  TLOU Part 2 Remastered - Release Date, Price, &amp; Biggest Changes   The Last of Us Part 2&#39;s remaster has been announced by Sony and Naughty Dog with all-new content and enhancements to utilize the PS5&#39;s hardware.   


 The Last Of Us Online Canceled So Naughty Dog Can Focus On Single-Player 
         




In an update published to Naughty Dog&#39;s website on December 14, 2023, the developer revealed the cancelation of a project known internally as The Last of Us Online. The studio&#39;s reasoning for the cancelation has to do with the game&#39;s scope: &#34;To release and support The Last of Us Online we&#39;d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games.&#34; According to the update, the studio felt that further pursuance of The Last of Us Online, and the effort required to keep it running as a live-service game, would require abandoning the single-player experiences that afforded Naughty Dog its reputation.

While TLOU Online&#39;s cancelation is disappointing, the reasoning is sound. The update from Naughty Dog also confirms that the multiplayer project had been in pre-production since the development of TLOU Part 2. This corroborates previous indications from the studio that TLOU Part 2 was originally supposed to ship with a multiplayer component, just like its predecessor, but the game mode had grown too ambitious, and was spun off into a separate project instead. Said project was announced with a single concept art image at Summer Game Fest 2022, but without a title. Sporadic concept art is all the promotion the game would receive over the next year-and-a-half, teasing a San Francisco setting.




While Naughty Dog was &#34;enthusiastic about the direction&#34; of TLOU Online, earlier reports suggest the game did not satisfy some form of internal PlayStation evaluation. In May 2023, Bloomberg reported that Bungie – acquired by Sony in 2022 – was consulted on the project because of its success with Destiny 2, and &#34;raised questions about the The Last of Us multiplayer project&#39;s ability to keep players engaged for a long period of time.&#34; Naughty Dog then quickly, formally announced that the project was delayed indefinitely to be reassessed. Now, The Last of Us Online&#39;s cancelation seems poised to put the franchise&#39;s multiplayer ambitions on ice for good.



 The Last Of Us May Never Have Another Multiplayer Game 
          

Bungie was, in part, brought into the PlayStation Studios fold because of its expertise in the live-service arena – Destiny 2 has persisted for six years. PlayStation had, at one point, more than 10 live-service titles in the works, though half of them have been delayed, according to Game Informer, The Last of Us Online presumably among them. Bungie&#39;s evaluation of the project touches on the crux of modern live-service games: longevity. Especially since The Last of Us&#39; multiplayer project was rumored to be free-to-play, it would have likely been supported by a constant content drip – seasonal additions, battle passes, cosmetics, etc.




Naughty Dog&#39;s allusion to this in its cancelation statement, about choosing between being &#34;a solely live service games studio&#34; or one devoted to the &#34;single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog&#39;s heritage,&#34; then has significant implications for the developer&#39;s output going forward. The rise of live-service games has been accompanied by the downfall of more traditional multiplayer modes, like The Last of Us&#39; Factions. With game development cycles continuing to become longer, and live-service ventures requiring constant maintenance, there&#39;s simply not enough resources to pursue both, at least in Naughty Dog&#39;s case.

In Naughty Dog&#39;s May 2023 statement on TLOU Online&#39;s indefinite delay (via X, formerly known as Twitter), there is a reference to &#34;a brand new single-player experience,&#34; which has still not been revealed. The Last of Us Part 3 leaks have indicated a sequel is in production, and Uncharted 5 may have been teased, so Naughty Dog&#39;s single-player future was never really in doubt. Uncharted 4 shipped with a multiplayer mode, but that was roughly two years before PUBG: Battlegrounds and Fortnite brought the battle royale genre into the limelight, ushering in the modern, potentially lucrative live-service era.





 

Naughty Dog&#39;s technical prowess and high storytelling standards, combined with expectations that multiplayer games will be supported and iterated on well after launch, means actively supporting a live-service title while developing single-player games is likely impossible logistically. This isn&#39;t necessarily unique to Naughty Dog; the industry at large has almost entirely moved away from pack-in multiplayer modes. It&#39;s disheartening to consider there may never be a follow-up to The Last of Us Factions, but it&#39;s essentially a consequence of a consumer-driven industry shift – developing a multiplayer game is simply not worth the investment if it doesn&#39;t return profit for years post-launch.



Factions is still playable in The Last of Us Remastered, the PlayStation 4 remaster of the original game, but is not included in The Last of Us Part 1, the PS5 remake.







The Last of Us Online&#39;s cancelation is ultimately a double-edged sword. Naughty Dog refocusing on single-player games is wonderful news, but it also doesn&#39;t inspire any hope that Factions will see any sort of return. The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is shipping with a new roguelike game mode and some Lost Levels cut during development, but the original release&#39;s multiplayer hopes are soundly dead. Unless Naughty Dog shifts its entire focus toward a multiplayer game, or establishes another studio for that express purpose, The Last of Us will likely never have multiplayer again, nor will the developer&#39;s other titles.
