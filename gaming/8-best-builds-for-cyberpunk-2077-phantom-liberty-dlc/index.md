 10 Best Game-Changing Features In Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC 
Phantom Liberty doesn’t just add an emotionally charged spy thriller storyline to Cyberpunk 2077, but many exciting new features as well.












 








 8  Ninja Assassin 
Cloak and Dagger
        

The first major build here is Ninja Assassin, which focuses directly on stealth and fast movement that allows you to pick off enemies individually. Ninjutsu is the must-have Perk of this path, giving you increased crouching movement speed at Level 1 and eventually letting you sprint while crouching at Level 3. This enables you to move incredibly quickly while staying silent around larger groups of hostile foes in Cyberpunk 2077.
Other abilities that affect your mobility are recommended for this build to let you perform silent takedowns at any point on the battlefield. Equipping Optical Camo allows you to turn completely invisible, leaning even more into the &#34;Assassin&#34; route. Even though silenced weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 are slightly weaker with the Phantom Liberty DLC updates, they are still fantastic for this path.





 7  Onslaught Tank 
No Pain, No Gain
        

The opposite of the previous build in Cyberpunk 2077 is the Onslaught Tank, which emphasizes the Body Attribute and its skills. These combine with Perks like Adrenaline Rush that are tied to health regeneration and a boost to your overall HP. Shotgun and LMG weapons are good for this route since your defense will generally outpace basic enemies and allow you to take them out far before you lose too much health.
Other Perks called Die! Die! Die! and Spontaneous Obliteration let you dismember enemies with increased damage from Shotguns and LMGs and reload slightly faster. 






 6  Melee Blades 
Slice and Dice


 







Another close-range path that opts for melee weapons instead of guns is Melee Blades, which directs the Reflex Attribute tree into potent abilities. Like Ninja Assassin, your focus will be on movement skills, but this time, take as many Blade-related traits as possible. According to denofgeek, the goal is to dash from enemy to enemy and do fast finishers with bladed weapons.
The Mantis Blades are crucial here, so you&#39;ll have to invest in Perks that let you slide and sprint around a battlefield at stunning speeds in Cyberpunk 2077. The Militech Berserk cyberware helps with this build for the huge reduction in Stamina costs while bolstering your attack speed and power. It also gives you complete immunity to damage for 12 seconds, letting you dice up enemies like butter for little to no risk.​​​​​​​





 5  Fire Samurai 
Controlling the Inferno


 







The backbone of the Fire Samurai build revolves around the Thermal Katana weapon, a blade that can set enemies on fire when you hit them. There are connections to the Melee Blades route here but with greater attention to defense rather than pure aggression. The Lead and Steel perk allows you to block incoming projectiles with Blades at Level 2, allowing you to approach enemies with ranged guns in Cyberpunk 2077.
This naturally progresses to the Bullet Deflect Perk, which knocks back bullets to wherever you aim with your blocking Blade if your Stamina is above 33%. YouTube creator Big Dan Gaming also suggests spending points on the Body Attribute to give you greater health because of the inevitable in-your-face combat style. This path is incredibly versatile with tech in Cyberpunk 2077, pairing well with almost any type of cyberware.





 4  Cyber Cowboy 
The Gunslinger of the Future
        

One-shot kill archetypes are always strong in Cyberpunk 2077, with the Cyber Cowboy falling into this category by using the Cool Attribute to boost critical hit chances. Focus and Deadeye are Perks necessary for this build that drastically boost your weak spot and headshot damage. At Cool Level 20, you should also grab the Nerves of Tungsten-Steel Perk, which makes every shot on a weak point a critical hit automatically.
Normally, the Focus Perk removes the Stamina cost per shot of your gun when you aim for 2.5 seconds. If you get the Head to Head perk, this cost is reset immediately, letting you conserve resources if you keep killing enemies. 






 3  Techno-Necromancer 
Smart Weapons, Borg Body
        

The Techno-Necromancer goes all-in on tech-related weapons and enhances the amount of Cyberware you can have to turn your character practically into a cyborg. License to Chrome is a perk that improves your Cyberware stat modifiers in Cyberpunk 2077 and gives you a new slot for your skeleton at the highest Level. You will probably want the Bolt Perk to increase your tech weapons&#39; damage and give them new properties.
The Intelligence and Cool Attributes define this build, tying directly into damage modifiers for smart weapons in place of hacking skills. This path isn&#39;t about subtly; it&#39;s about giving your character every type of tech weapon imaginable, either from Cyberware or certain guns. Rifles and SMGs thrive with the Techno-Necromancer, allowing you to engage in firefights at mid-range and activate different Cyberware between shots.





 2  David Martinez 2.0 
The Perfect Edgerunner


 







Plenty of Easter Eggs in Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty reference David Martinez, one of the protagonists from the Cyberpunk Edgerunners Netflix show. The DLC has plenty of new tools to create a 1-to-1 interpretation of the character, especially when you invest points in the Body and Tech Attributes. You should take every Perk on the right and left sides of the Bodytree to get started.
The most important piece of a David build comes from Militech &#34;Apogee&#34; Sandevistan, the Cyberware that has you travel so fast that it seems to slow down time. This path relies on activating the Sandevistan to approach enemies at impossible speed, then using superior physicality to beat them down with your bare hands. Equipping the Thermal Gorilla Arms lets you completely pummel almost any foe in Cyberpunk 2077.





 1  Marathon Netrunner 
Cutting Edge Tech
        

Hacking has always been one of the best aspects of Cyberpunk 2077, with the Marathon Netrunner going all-in on abilities that manipulate a battlefield&#39;s tech in your favor. Tech and Intelligence Attributes mold your character into a Netrunning machine, unlocking many important skills to pick from. Try to max out these trees to have many useful Perks at your disposal.
The first thing you&#39;ll want to get for this build is Hack Queue, which allows your character to perform Quickhacks at Level 2. Quickhacks let you spend RAM to alter tech during combat fast, with other Perks such as Feedback Loop and Proximate Propagation helping to increase the recovery rate and reduce the cost of this resource. Overclock is the ultimate trait, allowing you to slow time and perform Quickhacks without RAM.
With many new builds available in the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077, you have many options when considering how to design your character&#39;s playstyle that will keep your experience fun throughout Night City.
