## Literature Review

Honour Mode comes with the threat of permanent death in Baldur’s Gate 3 if the party is wiped out. And these decisions will give you a game over.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has added Honor Mode for any Tav who wants to test their mettle against the threat of permanent death in the event of a total party kill and bosses with Legendary Actions. The risks of Honor Mode can also make parties reconsider courses of action that they maybe wouldn&#39;t give a second thought otherwise. However, that also means that there&#39;s the possibility that parties will make decisions that they end up regretting, especially if they result in a total party kill, or drain the group of a lot of resources that could&#39;ve been saved for other encounters.
With Honor Mode, even encounters that seemed easy on Balanced difficulty can be deadly because the safety net of returning to the last save file in the event of a full party wipe isn&#39;t there. Some other changes that add to the difficulty are the inclusion of Legendary Actions for bosses, a more difficult action economy that makes it harder for the party to get in multiple attacks at one time, and items cost more to purchase, while the party earns less gold in-game. It&#39;s no surprise that Honor Mode can be filled with regret, given that the consequences of some decisions can mean starting from the beginning again.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Fighting The Harpies 
Without Calm Emotions
        

The Harpy fight can be easy to miss on a first playthrough. But on an Honour Mode run, it might be better to delay fighting the Harpies until the party has both calm emotions and sanctuary available as spells. This is especially true if the party wants to keep Mirkon alive, since the Harpies&#39; ability to lure members towards them and basically force the affected companions to skip their turn makes them a difficult fight, and one that&#39;s easy to lose at a low level.





 9  Fight Intellect Devourers Without A Full Party 
Recruit More Members And Return
        

On the Ravaged Beach, Tav comes across Shadowheart first, and then they run into groups of Intellect Devourers that attack them. While this fight is manageable, it can lead to a party wipe, since there are only two characters in the fight using the standard route, and they don&#39;t have a lot to work with at such low levels. Because of this, it&#39;s better to go around the Intellect Devourers, pick up Astarion and Gale, then return with a full party to get the experience from them.

 8  Not Using The Environment 
Helps Deal And Avoid Damage


 







Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has environments designed in a way that lets the party use their surroundings to help in battle, either to deal extra damage, or as cover to avoid taking damage. This includes using the Firewine Barrels near enemies to cause explosions, and hopefully deal extra damage. However, the environment can also be used to sneak around enemies, or control lines of sight, so that enemies have fewer options for attacking.

There are a plethora of choices to make throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, however some really should be avoided as they&#39;ll lead to a rather abrupt end.








 7  Forgetting Potions 
Alchemy Can Be A Lifesaver


 







Potions of Healing are, of course, incredibly useful at every point in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, regardless of being in Honour Mode or just a normal playthrough. However, certain potions, like those that turn the drinker invisible, can be great for sneaking up on enemies to get the bonus damage from the surprise. Then, there are elixirs that can be crucial in fights, like adding universal resistance, or getting a damage boost from the Elixir of Hill Giant Strength.





 6  Talking To Isobel Too Early 
And Starting The Fight With Marcus


 







Honour Mode prevents save scumming, so speaking with Isobel when Jaheira first brings it up in Act 2 can be disastrous for a party. The fight against Marcus to keep Isobel from being kidnapped is already tough, since Isobel gets targeted and isn&#39;t as durable as characters like Karlach. And if Isobel&#39;s health hits zero, the fight ends, she&#39;s taken by Marcus, and the protection around Last Light Inn falls, meaning that Shar&#39;s Curse can reach the people taking shelter there. As such, it&#39;s better to put off speaking with her, or at least be ready for the fight with scrolls and potions.





 5  Missing Balthazar Early 
Fight Before Shadowfell
        

Balthazar fights the party when they arrive at the end of Shadowfell, where Nightsong is being kept. Here, he summons a ton of skeleton minions to help him in the fight, and they&#39;re prone to pushing companions off the edge of the floating island, which results in death. However, Balthazar can be encountered in his chambers near the beginning of the Gauntlet of Shar, and he isn&#39;t hostile here. With enough gunpowder barrels and a Fireball, he&#39;s easy to defeat early, and without taking any casualties.





 4  Fighting Mud Mephits 
When Investigating Kagha
        

Usually, the party investigates Kagha at a fairly low level, so encountering the Mud Mephits can be dangerous. It doesn&#39;t help that the Ancient Mephits keep summoning the smaller Mephits to join the fight, which quickly becomes overwhelming for a lower-level party. Here, it&#39;s hard to avoid the Mephits when investigating Kagha, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to have some scrolls available and try to burn down the Ancient Mephits as quickly as possible.

 3  Not Poisoning The Goblin Camp 
Gain Experience And Cull Enemies
        

The Goblin Camp can be overwhelming due to the number of enemies it contains and how quickly a fight can go wrong because of that. Instead, it&#39;s best to send in Astarion with the Wyvern Toxin, and have him sneak to the cauldron to pour it in and poison a large chunk of the Goblins. This task becomes even easier with the help of Turn-Based Mode and either an Invisibility Potion or the invisibility spell cast on him.

 2  Fighting Anders Early 
His Smite Is Too Strong
        

Anders is the Paladin who leads the group hunting Karlach on Zariel&#39;s orders, and Paladins are hard to fight in any difficutly mode. His Smite alone can wipe out a party member, and his melee attacks are strong on their own, too. In this fight, it&#39;s important to get the first hit on him, and deal as much damage with it as possible to burn him down before he can retaliate.





 1  Underestimating Legendary Actions 
Actions Unique To Honour Mode
        

The biggest mistake that leads to regret in Honour Mode is underestimating Legendary Actions, which were added only for Honour Mode and are much more powerful than normal actions. Even the Owlbear Mom in the cave has a Legendary Action that calls her mate, and she&#39;s powerful enough without him, able to cause a total party wipe. Now in Honour Mode, she can call for help and bring her already tough fight to a new level of difficulty. And she&#39;s far from the only enemy this applies to, as Legendary Actions were added to bosses throughout the game.
Honour Mode presents a new, daunting challenge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that forces players to take extra care when weighing their decisions, as one wrong choice can end the run. The party is forced to use every resource at their disposal, but even that might not be enough to avoid death. However, it&#39;s good to remember that running away might be the best choice during an Honour Mode fight in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
