## Literature Review

Getting a Mini Seelie in Genshin Impact Version 4.3 is a fun plus to participating in the returning Lost Riches event focused on the Seelie guides.





Although there are 6 different types of Mini Seelies in Genshin Impact&#39;s Lost Riches, a player can only purchase one. However, as this event comes back, players can collect more. The newest one exclusive right now to this event is the Brilliance Seelie, which can swim next to the player underwater in Fontaine. There is no real value to using one with you underwater aside from its cosmetic purpose.

 How to Obtain a Mini Seelie 
          

​​By participating in the Lost Riches event, players in Genshin Impact can purchase a Mini Seelie. They can be purchased with 160 Ancient Iron Coins, which is the free currency of the current event, much like the desired free-to-play Primogems.

The way to obtain these coins is by following a Treasure-Seeking Seelie to certain locations around Teyvat. This also means that you will need to prepare to search a region for wisps and monsters that will drop an Exquisite Chest with the coins.



Once equipped, it is considered a Gadget as its Equipment type. Anything else equipped at the time will need to be switched to receive the Mini Seelie pet effect.

 Mini Seelie Colors and Effects 
          

Each Mini Seelie from the Lost Riches event in Genshin Impact has a unique personality and description. The one you choose is based on aesthetic and preference, as none is better than the other. Some Mini Seelie colors are also more based around the Teyvat Archons, which are the main elements.

For example, Mini Seelie Moss, which came out last year, is based on Dendro characters while Mini Seelie Viola has Electro elements to it.
