## Literature Review

These 90 Day Fiancé cast members aren&#39;t faking it when they refer to themselves as professional &#34;models&#34; on social media and on the reality TV show.




90 Day Fiancé franchise has several cast members claiming to be models, but only a few have managed to do it professionally. The franchise has featured several cast members from the time it launched season 1 in 2014, and there have been plenty that have made it big on social media since. Some have turned into influencers, who are Instagram models, promoting products in exchange for money.




However, there are those stars who have been featured on magazine covers and in fashion campaigns, proving they have what it takes to be a model. Here’s a look at all such celebrities from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise who are into modeling for a living. They are the ones posing for fashion pictures, getting fitted into the best designer clothing, and advertising a variety of products with ease instead of using the reality TV show as a platform to launch careers as snake oil salesmen or making it big in adult modeling.
