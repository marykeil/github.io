## Literature Review

While helmets do provide benefits to their users, there are some pretty stylish helms in Baldur’s Gate 3 for those who prefer style over substance.




Using stylish helms in Baldur’s Gate 3 may not give players a tactical advantage in combat, but it may aid them with further immersion, as they dress their characters according to their own sense of style. Helmets are a secondary piece of equipment in the game and do not normally add to the AC (Armor Class) of a character, but often provide special bonuses and even unlock unique skills for those who equip them. Coincidentally, some of the best helmets in Baldur’s Gate 3 in terms of stats and abilities are also some of the most stylish helms in the game.
For players who prefer style to substance, there are plenty of options to choose from. It is quite common for headgear to be invisible in games and, in fact, there is an option to disable them in Baldur’s Gate 3, allowing players to keep their characters’ heads clean while retaining any benefits provided by the equipment. Nevertheless, there are several good-looking helms that can be found throughout the game that further incentivize showing off headgear, even if that blocks their companions’ faces. Some are hard to find, but may just be worth the effort.
            
 
 One Easily Missed Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Mechanic Will Have Companions Camping In Style 
There are many mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are not evidently explained. Here is one that may make your camping sessions more pleasant.












 








 10  Key of the Ancients 
Rarity: Uncommon
        

While circlets are often very discreet and do not match the aesthetic appeal of some helms and hoods, there is one particular piece that is extremely stylish. The Key of the Ancients is a beautiful circlet that resembles a crown of thorns or at least branches, making it fit for a druid or a druid companion in Baldur’s Gate 3.
A good aspect of it is that the Key of the Ancients can be obtained in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3. This is a great early-game acquisition that can either be looted from Nettie or Findal in the Druid Grove. Equipping it grants a &#43;1 to Nature checks.





 9  Jannath&#39;s Hat 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

While not particularly stylish in a high fantasy world, Jannath’s Hat has a resemblance to real-world cowperson hats, making it one of the coolest pieces of headgear in the game. To obtain it, players need to make their way down to Act 3 in Baldur’s Gate 3, but its aesthetic value and stat bonuses are worth it.
Jannath’s Hat is a very rare headwear that gives the equipping character an Advantage on both Persuasion and Deception checks. This is a perfect match for characters with Charisma-based builds. It also makes them look like they have arrived from the Wild West.





 8  Hood of the Weave 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

One of the few hoods that look absolutely gorgeous, Hood of the Weave mixes a stylish hood with a circlet. This is a very rare helmet that can be purchased from the Mystic Carrion in Act 3. It fully captures the mysticism around the weave, the source of all magic in Baldur’s Gate 3.
Another positive aspect about the Hood of the Weave is the fact that its Arcane Enchantment skill gives the equipping character a &#43;2 bonus to Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Rolls, making them more effective and elusive when dealing with special powers.





 7  Sarevok&#39;s Horned Helmet 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

Sarevok’s Horned Helmet truly captures the brutish visuals of its original owner, allowing players to look menacing. The very rare helmet is, essentially, a creature’s skull with horns adorning it, and even sharp teeth acting as a faceguard. Players can only unlock it in Act 3, but this is also one of the best helms in Baldur’s Gate 3.
Sarevok’s Horned Helmet prevents the user from being Frightened or affected by any other emotion-altering conditions. It also grants Darkvision and, if the character already has it, the Darkvision is enhanced. Additionally, it reduces the number needed for a Critical Hit, making it both menacingly cool and a really great piece of gear.





 6  Steelwatcher Helmet 
Rarity: Rare


 







The Steelwatcher Helmet in Baldur’s Gate 3 is not as good as some of the other pieces but is equally stylish. This is, in essence, the head of a Steel Watcher from the city of Baldur’s Gate, and it possesses quite some finesse in its design. In addition to its beautiful metalwork, the helm is adorned with a plume, which gives it a regal aspect.
Steelwatcher Helmet grants vision in the dark, prevents the user from being Blinded, and gives Advantage on Constitution Saving Throws, all of which are pretty good benefits. Nevertheless, it is its design that makes this one of the coolest helms in the game.





 5  Mask of the Shapeshifter 
Rarity: Legendary
        

The Mask of the Shapeshifter is a very scary headgear, which also makes it one of the most stylish pieces in the game. This is a Legendary helmet that is an exclusive benefit provided by the Digital Deluxe Edition of Baldur’s Gate 3. The gear has its perks, such as allowing the user to cast Disguise Self once per turn.
However, it is its three-faced design that leaves a mark. The Mask of the Shapeshifter in Baldur’s Gate 3 is a bulky piece of metal with three faces carved into it, giving the aspect that it will follow a person wherever they go. It doesn’t match many body armor pieces, but it doesn’t really matter either.





 4  Shadow of Menzoberranzan 
Rarity: Rare
        

The Shadow of Menzoberranzan is a hood-like helmet in Baldur’s Gate 3 that shares aspects of its design with the Covert Cowl. This is a dark-hooded cowl that covers the equipping character&#39;s head and comes with a stylish mask that also conceals a large portion of their face.
For characters that are supposed to look secretive and sneaky, this is a great helmet to wear. The Shadow of Menzoerranzan goes along spectacularly well with the Penumbral Armour and the Spidersilk Armour body pieces. When combined, they give the character a perfect rogueish look. It tops that off with Shrouded in Shadow, a Concentration ability that turns the user invisible.





 3  Mask of Soul Perception 
Rarity: Very Rare
        

One of the most overlooked helms in the game is also one of the coolest and best pieces of gear in Baldur’s Gate 3. The Mask of Soul Perception is a late-game acquisition, as it is only available in the Lower City, but it is extremely stylish. This item is a beautifully adorned blue helm with gold details and horn-like elements at its top and bottom.
The light blue glowing symbol on the helm&#39;s forehead also makes it quite remarkable. The fact that the Mask of Soul Perception gives a &#43;2 bonus to Attack Rolls, Initiative Rolls, and Perceptions Checks, along with the ability to cast Detect Thoughts makes it even cooler, even if not aesthetically.





 2  Grymskull Helm 
Rarity: Very Rare


 







One of the most stylish helmets can be acquired in Act 1. The Grymskull Helm requires Heavy Armor Proficiency, but it is worth the investment. This piece of gear makes the user look like a fallen knight, especially if they have glowing eyes that pierce through the headpiece.
Grymskull Helm is a drop from the Grym boss in Baldur’s Gate 3 in the Adamantine Forge and perfectly matches the Adamantine Splint Armour body piece, allowing the user to dress up as a ghastly blue-colored knight. It also has incredible benefits, such as invulnerability to Critical Hits, Resistance to Fire damage, and the ability to cast Hunter’s Mark on opponents.





 1  Helldusk Helmet 
Rarity: Very Rare


 







The Helldusk Helmet is simultaneously one of the most stylish and one of the most menacing helms in Baldur’s Gate 3. This special item is directly related to the cambion Raphael and lives up to its infernal reputation. The headpiece matches the Legendary Helldusk Armour body piece and makes the user look like a devil walking through Faerûn.
It also grants great perks, such as invulnerability to Critical Hits, a &#43;2 bonus to Saving Throws against spells, invulnerability to Blindness, the ability to see in magical and ordinary darkness, and access to Immolating Gaze. This is the strongest helm in the game, and it just so happens that it is also the most stylish helmet in Baldur’s Gate 3.
