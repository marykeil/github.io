## Literature Review

Nina is an interesting potential partner in Coral Island, as she does not actually live on the island at the start of the game, arriving in Summer.





Nina comes from a well-off family who moved away from Coral Island many years ago. She&#39;s intelligent, well-traveled, flirty, and humble. She&#39;s close to the Coral Inn twins, Suki and Alice, and has her friend Lily look after the Abandoned Villa when she isn&#39;t there. Her schedule can be tricky when you first move to Starlet Town, but she can be a great romance option once you meet her.

 Best Gifts For Romancing Nina 
          

To gain Hearts with Nina and further your relationship in Coral Island, you will need to give her gifts. Luckily, Nina has a lot of beloved gifts thanks to a special category of items: juice. If you give Nina any fruit or vegetable juice, she will love it. If you&#39;re focusing on Nina in your quest for romance, you should quickly invest in a Keg. You can craft a Keg when you reach Level 6 in your Farming. The Keg costs 30 Wood, 2 Bronze Bars, 1 Silver Bar, and 20 Scrap.

                  How To Give Gifts in Coral Island   To give gifts to Townies in Coral Island, players must first have the item equipped in their hotbar before handing the object over to the character.   



You can give Nina two gifts a week. The exception to this rule is Nina&#39;s birthday on Winter 24. If you&#39;ve given Nina her two gifts by the time her birthday arrives, you can still give her a birthday gift.

 All Heart Events For Nina 
          

Nina has seven different Heart Events in Coral Island. Each event is available the day after you reach the prerequisite amount of Hearts. Like all bachelors and bachelorettes in Coral Island, Heart Events provide insight into the characters and help the player develop a relationship with them. To unlock the 10 Hearts event, you will need to get a necklace from Pablo and give it to Nina after the 8 Hearts event.




To trigger a Heart Event, you will need to visit a particular location within a specific window of time. Sometimes, the event is locked behind a particular season or type of weather. Others only trigger after you receive a letter. However, if the day has the right conditions for the Heart Event, you should get the prerequisite letter in the mail when you wake up and leave the house. You also must see each Heart Event in the order provided.

  Hearts   Day   Time Period   Location    3 Hearts   Sunny or Windy weather   6:00 - 23:59   Farm    5 Hearts   Any   7:00 - 16:00   Community Center Library    6 Hearts   Any   7:00 - 16:00   Community Center Library    7 Hearts   Any   9:00 - 20:00   Abandoned Villa    7 Hearts   Sunny or windy weather after the first 7 Hearts event   8:00 - 17:00   Outside Fishensips    8 Hearts   Any   18:00 - 23:59   Abandoned Villa    10 Hearts   Sunny weather in Spring, Summer, or Fall   15:00 - 17:00   Garden Lane   






Once you complete the 10 Hearts event, you can propose to Nina. She will accept, and the two of you will have a beautiful wedding with all the residents of Starlet Town as guests. With that, you have successfully romanced Nina from all the viable and amazing options available in Coral Island.
