## Literature Review

There are a plethora of choices to make throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, however some really should be avoided as they&#39;ll lead to a rather abrupt end.




Baldur’s Gate 3 is a game all about choice and offers an immense amount of freedom when it comes to completing quests. However, not all those choices are good ones, and there are a surprising number that can lead to an instant game over for the party. From annoying would-be gods and desperate escapees to poor choices in the face of danger, there are a plethora of choices in BG3 that can result in instant death.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
While some may be content to save scum their way through Baldur’s Gate 3 right to the end, knowing what choices result in death can make the journey a little easier. This becomes especially important in BG3’s new Honour Mode which only allows one save and if the party wipe then it is truly game over. While death rarely means the end in BG3, it can put a dampener on the day, particularly if the last save point was hours ago.
            
 
 10 Things In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Honour Mode That Make The Game Way Harder 
Patch 5 of Baldur’s Gate 3 adds an extra-hard difficulty setting called Honour Mode. Here are some things it changes to make the game more punishing.












 








 10  Kissing The Mind Flayer 
Found In Act 1 Beach Area
        

Very early after the BG3 tutorial area, as the newly escaped party are exploring the wrecked Nautiloid, they can find an injured mind flayer. This is the very same illithid that kidnapped everyone and put tadpoles in their eyes, so the sensible option here would be to be cautious and not get too close. However, interacting with the illithid will trigger a cutscene where it will attempt to control the character’s mind, making them love it so that it can feed on them to heal. If this is not successfully resisted, or if the character chooses to give in, then the mind flayer will feed, which obviously results in a very quick game over.





 9  Turning Into A Mind Flayer 
Many Triggers Throughout Acts 2 And 3


 







Another BG3 death by mind flayer comes if at any point the party is turned into illithids by the Absolute. This can happen in a few ways, but there are two which are the easiest to accidentally trigger. The first can be if the party attempts to leave the Act 2 area and return to Act 1. The Dream Guardian will warn three times that this is a terrible idea before the transformation begins as the Absolute finds the party.
Another easy way to trigger this death is if the Emperor is killed when the party first meets him. At the start of Act 3, it is revealed that the Dream Guardian is in fact a free illithid, and it can take a lot of people by surprise. If, however, the party does not believe the Emperor and kill him immediately, the transformation cutscene will trigger.





 8  Jumping Into The Underdark 
Chasm Found Under Village In Act 1
        

Jumping is a huge party of travel and battle in BG3, but there is one particular leap that should be avoided until the party is equipped with the proper spells. Deep under the Blighted Village in the heart of the phase spider nest there is a large hole that can be jumped down. However, taking that particular leap of faith will be met with a hilarious, if deadly, cutscene as the character tumbles down into the Underdark before landing in a very dead heap.
This is an alternative route into the Underdark, but the spell feather fall will be needed if the party wants to make it down in one piece. 






 7  Death By Super Weapon 
Triggered By Stealing The Blood Of Lathander In Act 1


 







When exploring Rosymorn Monastery in the Mountain Pass area, the party will find the Blood of Lathander, an awesome legendary mace. While there is a way to free this weapon without issue, it is easy to miss, but luckily the mace can be &#34;forced&#34; out of its current location and stolen. Doing so will trigger a timed event where the party will have a set number of turns to escape the monastery before a magical super weapon destroys the entire building. Failing to escape or disarm the weapon will result in death, as the concentrated power of the sun obliterates everything.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3 Players Are Still Missing Out On A Key Area 
At the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s first act, the party is told to choose between the Mountain Pass or the Underdark, but they can actually visit both.








 6  Give Into Lae’zel’s Suggestion 
Choice Made In Act 1 Cutscene
        

In Act 1, after taking a few long rests, a cutscene will trigger where the party feels unwell. This is the effects of the tadpoles in their brains finally catching up with them, and although all will be well thanks to the Dream Guardian, one party member has an alternative solution. During the scene, Lae’zel will approach the played character and offer to make the end quick. While most people will attempt to talk her out of this, as her meaning is plain, if her offer is taken she will quickly cut the throat of the character before presumably moving on to the rest of the party.





 5  Getting Blown Up 
Triggered By Angering Philomeen In Act 1


 







Down in the Underdark, the party comes across a group of cultists who have enslaved some deep gnomes. Here, the party will be asked to help free True Soul Nere from a cave-in to progress the story. There are a few ways to go about freeing Nere, but helpful BG3 NPCs will mention that a deep gnome ran away with a barrel of runepowder, a powerful explosive. Tracking down the gnome in question will lead to the party meeting Philomeen, who, if antagonized or goaded, will quickly blow herself and the party up, resulting in an unceremonious game over.





 4  Surrendering To Astarion 
Choice Made In Act 1 Cutscene
        

One night, the player character will wake up to find Astarion preparing to bite them, revealing that he is a vampire. He will ask very nicely if he can feed from the character. If they agree, a scene will play with Astarion biting and feeding on them. However, if the character surrenders to him entirely or fails their saving throws, then Astarion will continue to feed until he kills them.
The party will need to find the dead boar close to the Blighted Village with Astarion in the party to trigger this Astarion cutscene. Examining the boar will prompt a response from him and after a few long rests, the biting scene will trigger. 






 3  Not Resurrecting Gale 
Triggered By Gale’s Death
        

Gale is a smart wizard, and knowing that he has an incredibly destructive force inside him, he&#39;s made arrangements should he fall in battle. If Gale dies in BG3, a special cutscene will play where an illusory version of him will explain that he needs to be resurrected within three days and provides instructions on how to do that. The whole thing serves as a fun introduction to resurrection and is an enjoyable mini-quest. However, if Gale’s warning is ignored, then the orb inside him will detonate, presumably wiping out a large chuck of the Sword Coast along with the party.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.








 2  Vlaakith Using Wish 
Triggered By Insulting Vlaakith In Act 1
        

During the quest in the githyanki crèche, the party will come face to face with Vlaakith herself, the lich queen of the githyanki people. She will command the party to enter the Astral Prism and kill whoever they find there. However, if she is refused or insulted, Vlaakith will become enraged, and use the powerful wish spell to immediately kill the whole group. It is such a surprising act that it is no wonder it has caught many people off-guard.





 1  Surrendering Soul To Haarlep 
Choice Made In Act 3
        

Deep in Raphael’s House of Hope is Haarlep, Raphael’s personal incubus. If met, he (or she, depending on the form they take) will make an offer to the party - information if they play with Haarlep. Refusing outright will result in a tough fight, so surrendering is the smart option. Checks will need to be made along the way to attempt to hold onto the character&#39;s will. However, at the very last dialogue prompt, there is a choice: to tell Haarlep they can have the character&#39;s body but not mind, or to surrender heart and soul to them. Choosing the latter will result in a death of sorts as the incubus claims the character&#39;s soul for Raphael, making this one of the more unusual choices in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that results in death or a game over.
