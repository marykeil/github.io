## Literature Review

Cursed Bones are a vital ingredient for the most powerful charms in LEGO Fortnite. However, to find them, players must find and defeat Bone Wolves.





Bone Wolves only spawn in the Frostlands biome, so you will need to prepare before setting out. Craft a complete set of weapons and upgrade your LEGO Fortnite Village and crafting benches. Upgrading your crafting benches allows you to craft charms and totems that provide extra health and armor. The cold temperatures in the Frostlands will also deal damage over time, so you also need to keep warm by eating Spicy Peppers and Spicy Burgers for Cold Resistance.





 How To Find Cursed Bones In LEGO Fortnite 
          

Once you’re ready, head to the Frostlands biome. Usually, you should be able to spot snowy mountain ranges from your starting area. However, if you’re having trouble finding the Frostlands, try building a Balloon Platform to get a better view of your surroundings from above. Balloon Platforms are also great for exploring, so you can also search the Frostlands for what you need.

          

Bone Wolves only spawn in caves and are extremely hard to kill. However, you can use the same tactics you may have used to get Sand Claws from Sand Wolves. This includes bringing one of your Villagers along for extra combat support, focusing on ranged attacks, and practicing your dodge rolls in case the Bone Wolf gets too close for comfort. Bone Wolves are some of the toughest mobs in the game, so don’t try to fight them unless you’re fully prepared.






Caves in the Frostlands are even colder than outside. An Inner Fire Charm can increase your Cold Resistance, but you will need to track down some Blast Cores to craft one.




          

It’s also worth noting that monsters such as Skeletons will spawn in these caves, so you’ll need to watch out. Having a few friends join you can make all the difference when it comes to defeating Bone Wolves. Unfortunately, farming Cursed Bones is tricky, as each Bone Wolf only drops one Cursed Bone when killed, and they’re tough to kill even with endgame gear.



 How To Use Cursed Bones In LEGO Fortnite 
          




Cursed Bones are used in two crafting recipes: for the Regeneration Charm and the Charm of Resilience.

 Item  Resources Needed   Regeneration Charm    3 Heavy Wool Thread   5 Cut Sapphire   5 Cursed Bones   1 Frost Brute Scale      Charm of Resilience    3 Heavy Wool Thread   5 Iron Bars   5 Malachite Slabs   5 Cursed Bones      



These charms are excellent additions to your inventory, as they provide extra hearts of health and a significant amount of armor. The Regeneration Charm will regenerate your health over time – an excellent perk for tough fights – while the Charm of Resilience grants you bonus defense after you take damage.

Unfortunately, you also need to find and take down LEGO Fortnite’s Brutes and mine for some Sapphire to craft these charms. However, their effects are extremely powerful, granting you a huge boost to survivability as you explore the wilderness in LEGO Fortnite.
