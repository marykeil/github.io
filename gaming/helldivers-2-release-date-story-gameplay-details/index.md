## Literature Review

Helldivers 2 is an ambitious evolution of an interesting squad-based shooter. Here&#39;s everything to know about the upcoming release of the game.




Helldivers 2 is an exciting upcoming squad-based shooter, acting as a follow-up to the 2015 game Helldivers. Developer Arrowhead Game Studios hasn&#39;t released any titles in the interval between these games, but the long gap didn&#39;t go by idly, as the sequel is taking on a very different style and scope from the first game. Although both focus on co-operative shooter play, the switch from a top-down perspective to third-person gameplay makes Helldivers 2 an ambitious and hopefully immersive evolution.




Helldivers 2 isn&#39;t the best choice for anyone interested primarily in a lengthy single-player experience, as the basic ability to play through the game solo seems likely to be as much of an afterthought as in its predecessor. Team-based decision-making is an important part of surviving its levels, with coordinated loadouts and careful choices in combat both proving necessary to master its challenges. A diverse selection of environments present a variety of unique encounters with hostile alien creatures, but there isn&#39;t much time to stop to admire the scenery when every second can count.


 Helldivers 2 Release Date Info, Price, &amp; Platforms 
          

Helldivers 2 is set to release on February 8, 2024, almost 9 years after the March 2015 launch of the original game. Like its predecessor, Helldivers is sticking to PlayStation in terms of console releases, and it&#39;s skipping a cross-generation model to only appear on the PS5 this time. Although Arrowhead Game Studios is independent, both games have been published through Sony Interactive Entertainment, so it makes sense that the game is being leveraged as one of the few major PlayStation exclusives currently confirmed for a 2024 release.




                  If The Rumors Are True, No One Has To Force Xbox To Port Exclusives To PS5   Xbox might be making a big change with its handling of first-party games, and the shift in approach goes beyond anything that&#39;s legally required.   

Helldivers 2 was initially announced for a 2023 release, but that window was never clarified, and the first specific date to be announced was the February 8, 2024 one that still stands. A PlayStation trailer from Sony&#39;s CES 2024 press conference caused a bit of a scare with a mention of February 28 availability, but that appears to have been a mistake, as the most recent PlayStation Blog update regarding the game reaffirms February 8 as the release date. This date also applies to the PC release of the game, and crossplay will be available to make playing with friends on both systems possible at launch.

On PC, Helldivers 2 requires an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 TI or an AMD Radeon RX 470 to hit minimum settings, and an Intel Core i7-4790K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X on the CPU end. Hitting recommended settings jumps up to a GTX 2060 or RX 6600 XT and an i7-9700K or Ryzen 7 3700X, and Very High graphics in 4K need an RTX 4070 TI or RX 7900 XTX and an i5-12600K or Ryzen 7 5800X3D. 100 GB of storage is necessary across the board, and while minimum settings can get away with a 7200rpm HDD, everything else recommends an SSD.




Helldivers 2 can be pre-ordered on either platform for a base price of $39.99, so it&#39;s not looking to directly compete with 70 dollar AAA titles. The Super Citizen Edition does raise the price to $59.99 by including some goodies, which include customization options and gear, an extra mini-game that can be accessed on the ship in-game, and a &#34;Premium Warbond&#34; that seems likely to be some form of battle pass. Pre-orders add three armor sets into the mix, which are included regardless of which edition of Helldivers 2 is purchased.



 The Story &amp; Setting Of Helldivers 2 
          

Helldivers 2 isn&#39;t a great story-driven game, with most narrative elements simply serving as a basic premise to set up the gameplay. Alien invaders pose a threat to the planet of Super Earth, so they naturally have to be taken out through any means necessary. The Helldivers are an elite force with this basic mission, and since the slots in a squad are meant to be filled by real teammates instead of AI, there&#39;s not much of a focus on characters within the game of Helldivers 2 itself.




Most of the flavor in Helldivers 2 comes from its satirical elements, which clearly paint the picture that the Helldivers aren&#39;t exactly as noble of an idea as they&#39;re supposed to be. Everything is imbued with a dash of Starship Troopers, as the citizens of Super Earth are encouraged to violently go forth and defend the ideal of Managed Democracy. Only by eliminating everyone in sight can the Helldivers fulfill their goal as peacekeepers, so it&#39;s only natural that they need an overpowered arsenal to ensure that the galaxy isn&#39;t torn apart by war.

One major focus of the gameplay in Helldivers 2 is the gear, as selecting a loadout and using it well is much more than simply picking the highest stats. Different types of weapons and ammunition have varying degrees of efficacy against enemy types, and even the angle of attack can make a difference when it comes to penetrating armor. Equipment selected at the start of a mission can be later backed up with strategems, unique tools and assists that can be summoned while on the battlefield.




The intensity of Helldivers 2 is built around the expectation of frequent death, as a squadmate going down isn&#39;t the end of a mission. It&#39;s possible to summon reinforcements, so a player whose character has been killed can jump back in as a new recruit. Rewards for completing missions can be specced into a variety of different categories, from personal equipment to upgrades for the squad as a whole, adding a level of strategy to the game&#39;s overall trajectory of progression.



The ability to respawn is a major saving grace in Helldivers 2, as friendly fire is always on.




Helldivers 2 very much builds on the core of the first game in the series, but the change in perspective is enough to make it seem like a radically different experience overall. Considering that there&#39;s not much of a principal narrative to worry about, players shouldn&#39;t have any trouble hopping on to the franchise for the first time with the new entry, especially if they can convince several friends to go along for the ride. As a third-person squad shooter with a unique balance of high-stakes action and strategy, Helldivers 2 is an interesting standout among the 2024 action game releases revealed so far.
