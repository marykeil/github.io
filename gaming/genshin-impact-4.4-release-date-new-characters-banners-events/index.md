## Literature Review

Genshin Impact 4.4 will be a big update, with several events, story quests, and even a new map extension to Liyue. Here’s everything you need to know.




The details about Genshin Impact 4.4 have been officially confirmed by developer HoYoverse following the related livestream. A lot of the content that is planned for the upcoming patch has already been shared by leakers. Nevertheless, the official reveal comes as good news, as leaks can be inaccurate or subject to change ahead of the release of the Version. Among the reveals are Xianyun’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.4, facts about this year’s version of the Lantern Rite Festival, and even two map expansions to the region of Liyue.




Other than playable content itself, the developer also announced some quality-of-life improvements and showcased a few new skins for beloved Liyue characters – one of which will be obtainable for free. It seems like there is a lot to look forward to with the next update and, luckily, players will not have to wait too much longer before being able to play through it. Genshin Impact 4.4 is expected to arrive in January, even if at the end of the month.

                  New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.   


 Genshin Impact 4.4 - Release Date 
          

All the details regarding Version 4.4 were revealed in the update’s special event, held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch. The livestream revealed that Genshin Impact 4.4 will arrive on January 31. The date makes sense, as it follows the game’s regular six-week schedule. It also confirms that there have been no delays to the planned content. At this point, it is unlikely that Version 4.4 will be delayed. Previous content delays have been preceded by livestream delays. The last time a content delay occurred was with Version 2.7, back in mid-2022.






Version 4.2’s livestream suffered a delay in October 2023, but it did not affect the release date of the update itself.






 Genshin Impact 4.4 - Character Banners (&amp; New Characters) 
         

Though the new characters had been previously announced, HoYoverse has now revealed their official ratings and the order of the four character banners planned for Genshin Impact 4.4. During the first half of the update, also known as Phase 1, the character banners will feature the 5-star heroes Xianyun and Nahida. While Nahida is a rerun, Xianyun is a character debut. Xianyun is the human form of the Adeptus known as Cloud Retainer. She will be an Anemo unit, capable of buffing her teammates with HP restoration and increasing their jump height, which can then be used for Plunging Attacks.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Gaming Kit Leaks - Vision, Skills, &amp; Burst   The specifics of Gaming’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact, including his abilities and weapon type, have been mentioned in new Version 4.4 leaks.   

Gaming will also make his debut in Phase 1 banners, with an improved pull rate during the period. Gaming is a 4-star Pyro DPS unit that specializes in using a special form of Plunging Attack through the activation of his Elemental Skill. Following Gaming’s debut in these banners, he will be added to the standard loot pool and will be obtainable in all other banners in Genshin Impact, if players are lucky enough, including the standard banner and the weapons banner. The other 4-star characters with improved rates in Phase 1 character banners have not yet been announced.

The Phase 2 banners will be composed of reruns of Xiao and Yae Miko. While Yae Miko’s rerun is something of a surprise and a welcome addition – though it had been mentioned in leaks before the announcement – Xiao’s rerun in Genshin Impact 4.4 is not exactly a surprise. The 5-star Anemo DPS unit reruns annually, always during the same Version that hosts the Lantern Rite. In addition to that, his Plunging Attack gameplay kit fits perfectly with Xianyun’s abilities, making them a great duo to have in the same Version, even if not in the same Phase.






In Phase 1, the weapons banner will feature Crane’s Echoing Call, Xianyun’s signature catalyst, and A Thousand Floating Dreams, Nahida’s signature catalyst. In Phase 2, Xiao’s Primordial Jade Winged-Spear and Miko’s Kagura&#39;s Verity will have increased pull rates.






 Genshin Impact 4.4 - Story &amp; World Updates 
          

The main highlight of the feature is the Lantern Rite Festival. While no new Archon Quests are being added, per si, there will be story missions through the annual event. This year, the theme will be kites, and Fontainian technology has arrived to make kites fly more seamlessly. This contraption will make Cloud Retainer, or Xianyun, feel challenged, and she will try to show that the Adepti contraptions do a better job. Xianyun will also have a story quest of her own in Genshin Impact, allowing players to further interact with her.




In addition to the Lantern Rite Festival’s story, Version 4.4 will also introduce a new extension to the Liyue map. Northwest of Qingce Village, players will be able to explore the Chenyu Vale, a rich new environment with several landmarks, such as Qiaoying Village, Yilong Wharf, the Jademouth, Mt. Lingmeng, Chizhang Wall, and much more. Throughout their exploration, they will be guided by a carp god called Fujin, which had previously been leaked as a new adeptus in Genshin Impact 4.4.

There will be several stories to be uncovered in Chenyu Vale. This location allegedly establishes a direct route from Liyue to Fontaine. In addition to the landmarks and quests, players will also be able to encounter a new world boss in Chenyu Vale. The Solitary Suanni is a creature of legend and one that inspired the Wushou Dance, which can be seen executed by Gaming, for instance. This creature will also likely drop Talent materials for Xianyun and Gaming in Genshin Impact 4.4.



 Genshin Impact 4.4 - Events, Rewards, &amp; System Updates 
          




In addition to the narrative aspect, the Lantern Rite Festival will also be an event in the traditional gameplay sense, with activities and rewards to claim. There will be a total of three different types of activities. Paper Shadows A-Foraging will be a puzzle-based mini-game in which players have to control Guoba and Yuegui to achieve goals on a board. Joyful Beasters is a multiplayer mini-game inspired by Wushou Dances. It has three stages, each with different rules, and players will have to follow the rules to obtain points while also trying to disrupt other Genshin Impact competitors.

                  Genshin Impact 4.5 Leaks Reveal New Banner Characters   Even though Version 4.5 is still a ways away from arriving, there are already leaks regarding the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact.   

The last game mode in the Lantern Rite is Iridescent Cloud-Striding, where players will have to follow a special path and collect Cloud Lanterns as they enjoy the view. During the event, players can claim the new skin for Xingqiu, Bamboo Rain, for free. After the promotional period, the skin will be added to the store for purchase. The event will also offer Primogems, Crown of Insight, and several other prizes. Players will also be able to get one 4-star Liyue character for free – this includes Gaming, the new hero in Genshin Impact 4.4.






Ganyu and Shenhe will also receive new skins, though these will be premium items in the store.




To celebrate the release of Version 4.4, players will also be able to claim up to 10 Intertwined Fates, with three extra ones sent to every player’s mailbox. Receiver of Friends from Afar will be an extra event, somewhat related to the Lantern Rite, in which players need to cook special dishes for their friends who come to Liyue to celebrate the Festival. This event will offer several prizes, including Primogems in Genshin Impact. Outside the Lantern Rite Festival, there will be other events as well.

In Mondstadt, the Journey Through Hilinigmatic Terrain event will make players investigate the appearance of mysterious statues. They will have to use the Eye of Upano to attach themselves to Hilichurls and make their way through the camp to these statues. However, Samachurls can spot players. During the event, players will also face a special Samachural in a boss fight with several gimmicks, such as the usage of Plunging Attacks to break its shields. Triumphant Frenzy, on the other hand, will be a battle event with a randomized selection of trial characters in Genshin Impact.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Trials Are Finally Getting A Lot Better   Leaks indicate a small update to character trials in Genshin Impact 4.4, which may end up being a game-changing decision for players in the future.   

Genius Invokation TCG will also get an update with new cards, and the Version should end with Overflowing Mastery, which grants double rewards from Talent Domains. Other than that, Version 4.4 will implement an update to Artifact optimization, which will allow players to quickly equip items based on stats from other players. There is a lot of content planned for Genshin Impact 4.4 and, even with the lack of Archon Quests, this is a very large update.
