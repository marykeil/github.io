## Literature Review

Getting Monster Toughbone in Monster Hunter World will take some clever hunting for those hoping to obtain it for crafting materials or to sell.





In the Iceborne expansion for Monster Hunter World, quite a few things are introduced to the game, with the Monster Toughbone being one of them. With the DLC came new monsters, items, and a reward called Monster Toughbone. Players will have to have Iceborne to acquire this item and any of the crafting recipes that require it.

Players searching for Monster Toughbone also need to be of the Master Rank before they can even find it. Once players are of Master Rank, a variety of quests and Monsters will drop Monster Toughbone as a reward, but there are no specific locations where players can pick it up. Once found, players can carry 99 and sell them for 2000 Gold each.



Master Rank can only be achieved with the Iceborne expansion for Monster Hunter World. Players must also have completed the Land of Convergence quest and be of Hunter Rank 16. You will unlock the Master Rank as part of a quest with The Handler when you defeat the Ruiner Nergigante.







Seven total monsters will drop Monster Toughbone, the most promising of which is the Great Jagras. However, the following monsters will also drop the item at an 18-20% drop rate:

  Kulu-Ya-Ku   Banbaro   Nightshade Paolumu   Coral Pukei-Pukei   Beotodus   Viper Tobi-Kadachi  

Moreover, 39 quests have a chance to reward you with Monster Toughbone. However, if you’re looking to get some fast, the Hunter-Blunderer quest has a 100% chance of rewarding you with 3 Monster Toughbone pieces. This is an excellent way to start your collection of materials and maybe get a few more on the way. Additionally, the Special Arena quests with MR versions of monsters have a fairly high chance of dropping Monster Toughbone (around 43%) and are an excellent way to practice taking down monsters.

After acquiring a few of them, Monster Toughbone can be used to craft things such as the Ogre’s Jaw, a Great Sword, or the Jagras Helm (both Alpha and Beta versions). There are plenty of other crafting recipes, and using Master Rank materials such as Monster Toughbone will make your gear even better and perhaps help you defeat a monster such as a Tempered Lunastra in Monster Hunter World.
