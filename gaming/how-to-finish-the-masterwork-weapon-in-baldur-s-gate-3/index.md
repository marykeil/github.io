## Literature Review

One of the rarest weapons to create in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the Masterwork Weapon, a special tool that you can finish as part of a side quest in Act 1.





The &#34;Finishing the Masterwork Weapon&#34; side mission appears as your party explores the Blighted Village close to Druid Grove. A house on your right entering the Village leads to Highcliff&#39;s Journal, a book you can find to the left of the destroyed fireplace. Reading this book starts the quest, where you have to search for various blueprints and ingredients to craft an enchanted melee weapon in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Strongest Weapons In The Game So Far   In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, good character optimization can be the difference between a fight won or lost. Here are the best weapons in the game so far.

Once you read the Journal, you will realize that to craft the Masterwork Weapon, you must find the blueprints for its design inside the house. A trapdoor near the area where you found the book leads into a secret basement with a chest containing Highcliff&#39;s Blueprints. These instructions describe that the Masterwork upgrades three types of normal weapons in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: a Greatsword, Sickle, or Dagger.

The main ingredient to make an upgraded weapon is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Sussur Tree Bark, which only grows in the Underdark. This subterranean land can be reached in several ways as your party searches for the Sussur Tree, a plant you can spot northwest of the Underdark Beach. The bark from this Tree, unfortunately, can&#39;t be collected until your party travels east to a place called the Dread Hollow.






The best ways to reach the Underdark are through the Defiled Temple, going down the well of the Blighted Village, using Feather Fall from the portal in the Overgrown Tunnel, or by taking the elevator in the Zhentarim Hideout.




The Dread Hollow is guarded by Hook Horror monsters, dangerous monstrosity enemies that your party has to sneak past to reach an exposed part of the Sussur Tree. Use the Knotted Roots hanging around this area to climb the tree until you reach a large knot that&#39;s impossible to pass through. From here, interact with the highlighted square to harvest Sussur Tree Bark for the Masterwork Weapon in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.



 How To Craft a Masterwork Weapon In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 (BG3) 
          

Return to the Blighted Village with the Bark from the Underdark and one of the ordinary weapons you wish to craft into a magical tool in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. A melting furnace in the same basement where you found the Blueprints will be able to create a Masterwork Weapon of your choosing. You may only make one weapon from these three available options:




  Masterwork Weapon   Description    The Sussur Dagger   This rare Dagger has been darkened by the smoke from Sussur sap. It deals 1d4&#43;1 piercing damage and Silences enemies.    The Sussur Greatsword   This rare Greatsword has Sussur roots that extend from the hilt and into the blade. It thirsts for magic. The Greatsword deals 2d6&#43;1 slashing damage and Silences the enemy on hit.    The Sussur Sickle   This rare Sickle glows blue when cutting through arcane energy and has the sheen of Sussur sap. It deals 1d4&#43;1 slashing damage and Silences the target on hit.   





Simply place the Bark into the furnace to turn the fires of the forge blue, then put in the weapon you want modified to make one of three types of Masterwork Weapons.




You may notice that each weapon created has a special Silence property for when it lands a hit on an enemy. This effect prevents an enemy from casting spells, which can be an incredibly strong ability when your party is fighting dominant spell casters seen throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. In addition to this trait, any weapon created through the Masterwork procedure is now considered a &#43;1 magic weapon, dealing extra damage to your foes.

Completing the quest and finishing any Masterwork Weapon in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 grants you not only whatever item you crafted but also a good amount of experience that might cause your character to level up.
