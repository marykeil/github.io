## Literature Review

Catching Kyogre in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Indigo Disk will require you to get a Treat Key from Mr. Snacksworth by completing Blueberry Quests.





Kyogre is a Water-type Legendary from Ruby &amp; Sapphire (Gen 3) who can start a dangerous storm in its vicinity. The legendary Pokémon is a powerful team member to have, and in order to catch Kygore, you will have to complete many Blueberry Quests, a procedure you have to follow to catch every Legendary Pokémon in Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC.




                  Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests   In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.

In order to unlock Kyogre, you will need to complete enough Blueberry Quests (BBQs) so that Mr. Snacksworth can give you a Kyogre Treat Key. This Treat Key will reveal Kroger’s location in Paldea so you can add it to your Pokédex. It is worth pointing out that Treat Keys handed out by Snacksworth are randomized, which means you might have to complete plenty of BBQs in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet before you get your hands on one. 

According to Video Gamer, once you get the Kyogre Treat Key, you will discover that the Pokémon is located in the North Palawan Sea. You can reach the location by fast traveling to Casseroya Lake and then using the Flying ability unlocked during Indigo Disk to reach the location. You will see three tall stones sticking out of the water, and upon approaching it, Kyogre will spawn and wait for a battle. 




Since Kyogre is a Water-type Pokémon, it is weak to Electric- and Grass-type attacks. It is recommended to bring an Electric- or Grass-type Pokémon for the battle so that you will be able to bring Kyogre&#39;s health down easily. 



Be sure to save your progress before battling Kyogre so that you can catch it again if you accidentally defeat it.




Once Kyogre’s health is low enough, throw an Ultra Ball to catch it. It might take a few attempts; however, catching Kyogre in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet shouldn&#39;t be too challenging.
