## Literature Review

There are nine different Perk-a-Cola items to find and craft in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, giving you a wide variety of buffs against undead hordes.





During a round, you should be able to find Perk-a-Cola machines scattered around the stages of a map, displayed on your TacMap through a unique icon. However, the locations of these dispensers are randomized, meaning that they are never in the same place twice. If you&#39;re having a hard time finding a Perk-a-Cola machine, you usually will still get a can or two from Reward Rifts at the end of a contract in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.






The Reward Rifts Perk-a-Cola cans are always a random flavor, meaning the power-up you receive may not exactly fit your situation.




                  When Modern Warfare 3 Unlocks (Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Launch Times)   Modern Warfare 3 is only a short way away, but its exact launch times vary by region and purchased edition. Hereâ€™s everything there is to know.   


 How to Craft Perk-a-Cola in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

The best way to craft a Perk-a-Cola is to use the item&#39;s Schematics dropped through Story Mission rewards or Reward Rifts seen in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. While these Schematics are rare and randomly given, you&#39;ll be able to make whatever flavor whose blueprints you obtain over and over. Keep in mind that you can only make a Perk-a-Cola every three hours to store in your backpack, even with the right Schematics.




Once you have the recipe for a Perk-a-Cola flavor, go into the Gear Menu and select the Add Item prompt to begin crafting from your known Schematics. From here, you are able to make whatever type of can you have the blueprints for as you prepare to mow down Zombies and earn XP in Modern Warfare 3. There are nine unique flavors of Perk-a-Cola, including:

 Perk-a-Cola Flavor  Power-Up Description   Deadshot Daiquiri  Aiming down sights moves your view directly toward an enemy&#39;s weak point. Critical hit damage is greatly increased.   Death Perception  Item drops, chests, hidden enemies, and other materials are far easier to spot, even through solid walls.   Elemental Pop  Every time you fire a gun, your bullets have a small chance of applying a random Ammo Mod effect.   Jugger-Nog  Your maximum health greatly increases.   PHD Flopper  When you drop prone, you cause a massive explosion. The higher you fall, the greater the size of the explosion. While doing this, you have immunity from fall damage and AoE damage from any weapon you&#39;re using.   Quick Revive  Reduces the time it takes to revive one of your allies by 50%. Your health regeneration delay time is also decreased by the same amount.   Speed Cola  You can reload and replate any armor at much faster speeds.   Stamin-Up  Greatly improves your sprint and run speeds.   Tombstone Soda  When you die, your body creates a tombstone that acts like a Stash, storing your backpack items from your inventory into the next game.   






                  &#34;Warfare That Feels Dated&#34; - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Review   Despite fantastic visuals, the campaign for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 fails to push the series forward with gameplay that feels dated.   

You do not need to collect any crafting materials other than the Schematics to make any of the different flavors mentioned. While it may take some luck to find the right blueprints, once you craft Perk-a-Cola in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, you&#39;ll have the perfect beverage to combat the apocalypse.
