# 9 D&amp;D Spells That Were Cut From Baldurs Gate 3 (But Should Be Added For DLC)


## SUMMARY 


Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
adapts fifth edition 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons
 into a video game, but is not exhaustive in including all the tabletop game&#39;s spells. 
 Some cut spells could conceivably return if 
BG3
 gets a DLC expansion, even if they have rather situational uses. 
 Other 
DnD
 spells were removed from 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3
 because they were too difficult to implement in a video game.

## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has tons of fantastic spells, but there were almost more, with several well known D&amp;D spells left out from the final release.




Baldur’s Gate 3 has an arsenal of spells for characters to learn over the course of their adventures that cover an array of effects and scenarios. Amazingly, however, there were almost more Dungeons &amp; Dragons spells included in this already impressive list. Scouring through the game files reveals evidence of spells that didn’t make it into the final release of BG3, including some potential game changers.
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 does a great job at adapting many DnD fifth edition spells into a video game setting, although there are still some big differences between BG3 and DnD even beyond how some spells operate. Because of the change in medium, some spells have had to be tweaked slightly, while others simply didn&#39;t make the cut. Some DnD spells were simply too difficult to adapt to the video game medium, which lacks the free-form collaborative storytelling of the original tabletop game.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 9  Mending (Transmutation Cantrip) 
Bards, Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, Wizards
        

Mending is a transmutation cantrip that was cut from BG3, but could absolutely be reinstated for a DLC. Mending can repair simple objects by touching them, so long as the damage is no larger than one foot in any dimension. While the spell can fix magical items physically, it can&#39;t restore any enchantments to such an object. In BG3 mending would be great for repairing any environmental damage such as broken doors or barricades with the limitations of it being a cantrip naturally preventing it from becoming too overpowered.





 8  Arcane Eye (Fourth-Level Divination Spell) 
Wizards, Knowledge Domain Clerics


 







Arcane eye is a fantastic spell that would have changed how parties survey the entire map in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. With arcane eye, the caster creates a small invisible eye that lasts for one hour. Acting similarly to a familiar, the eye can fly around and send visual information back to the caster. With 30 feet of darkvision and the ability to squeeze through gaps as small as an inch, the arcane eye is a really useful scouting tool for adventuring parties.





 7  Comprehend Languages (First-Level Divination Spell) 
Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards
        

Comprehend Languages is a very useful spell in DnD as it allows the caster to understand any spoken language for one hour. This comes in handy when interacting with NPCs who don&#39;t speak the same language as any of the party. The spell can also allow the caster to read any written words so long as they are touching where the text is written but cannot decode ciphers or glyphs. It would be difficult to see how this could be implemented into BG3 where spoken language and text are all in the common.







 6  Identify (First-Level Divination Spell) 
Bards, Wizards, Knowledge Domain Clerics


 







Identify is a spell that gets a lot of use in DnD as not all DMs will immediately tell a party the details of an item they have just found. Identify does exactly what it sounds like, as it allows the caster to learn an item&#39;s properties such as what features it has, if it requires attunement or if it is cursed. This could perhaps work in BG3 on certain more powerful items, where the party would need to learn more about the item before they were able to use it properly.





 5  True Seeing (Sixth-Level Divination Spell) 
Bards, Clerics, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards
        

True seeing is a good example of a great DnD spell that would be difficult to translate to a video game setting. In DnD, true seeing allows the caster to have, or give another willing creature, truesight for one hour. Truesight allows the target to see into the Ethereal Plane, see invisible creatures, automatically detect illusions and see in both normal and magical darkness. As BG3&#39;s spell list caps out at level six, it is clear that true seeing did make the cut as it is such a situational but powerful spell whose effects are somewhat replicated by other items such as Volo&#39;s Ersatz Eye.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It) 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.








 4  Magic Circle (Third-Level Abjuration Spell) 
Clerics, Paladins, Warlocks, Wizards
        

Magic circle creates a cylinder of magic, 10 feet in radius and 20 feet tall, at a point in the ground the caster can see. When created, the spellcaster can choose one from either celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead and whether they wish to keep the chosen creature out or trap them within the cylinder. Magic circle is great for protecting a specific area to keep a creature type out or for trapping said creature, perhaps for interrogation. That said, it is difficult to imagine how this could have worked within BG3&#39;s combat with the casting time of one minute.





 3  Levitate (Second-Level Transmutation Spell) 
Sorcerers, Wizards


 







Levitate allows the caster to choose either one creature or object and make it levitate vertically up to 20 feet for 10 minutes. While levitate is really useful in DnD since it can lift up to 500 pounds, it would be difficult to implement in BG3, which already has the fly spell. Although in DnD these two spells serve very different functions, fly in BG3 does not behave the same way as it does in DnD, and instead acts as more of an enhanced jump ability. Because of this, levitate would be a little redundant outside specific circumstances, although having some quests or missions involving it could be fun.





 2  Magic Jar (Sixth-Level Necromancy Spell) 
Wizards
        

Magic jar is a wonderfully weird DnD spell that lets the caster&#39;s soul leave their body and possess other humanoids. The spell is fairly complicated, and that is probably one of the reasons magic jar didn&#39;t make it into BG3. As with some of the others on this list, it has such particular circumstances where it would be useful that it would be difficult to justify its inclusion on a spell list. However, what could be a lot of fun is a specific quest where magic jar was part of the story and needed to be used to solve the problem.
            
 
 7 Weird Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Spells You&#39;ve Probably Never Used (But Should) 
There are a plethora of wonderful spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to aid the party on their journey, but some of them are more than a little odd.








 1  Dispel Magic (Third-Level Abjuration Spell) 
Bards, Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards
        

Dispel magic is a spell that Larian worked very hard to include in the game, according to Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke in an interview on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons YouTube channel. Dispel magic works similarly to counterspell, which is in BG3, and ends one magical effect within range. However, according to Vincke, trying to get dispel magic to work in BG3 would have doubled the file size of the game to account for every instance of the spell being used, considering all the magic in the game. This is a shame but understandable, making it unlikely to appear in future editions or DLC for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, despite how great an addition it would be.
