## Literature Review

Grate Guy&#39;s Casino is a secret place in Super Mario RPG Remake filled with mini-games and prizes, but Mario will need a specific item to reach it.





Just like the other hidden secrets in Super Mario RPG Remake, Mario will need to track down an item to access this hidden casino and all its mini-games. In this case, Mario has the opportunity to win the required item in a game of juggling against the Knife Guy.




                  &#34;A Delightful Rendition of a Historic Treasure&#34;: Super Mario RPG Review   Super Mario RPG brings the fan-favorite classic back with welcome bells and whistles, inspiring players young and old to rediscover this Mario curio.   


 How To Get The Bright Card 
         

To find the Knife Guy, who will give Mario the special item, the Bright Card, head first to Booster Tower. If you have not yet reached this area, you will need to progress through the game until they reach this point since Knife Guy and Grate Guy are bosses in Super Mario RPG Remake. After defeating them, Knife Guy will hang around in Booster Tower to engage Mario in a juggling mini-game where he must score 12 points to win.

Super Mario RPG Remake will require Mario to watch as Knife Guy juggles several balls, three of which are red and one yellow. The objective is to watch closely and determine which hand the yellow ball lands in when he stops juggling. Though this may seem like a game of chance guessing, it isn&#39;t. As long as you observe, you can see which hand the yellow ball falls into. Mario earns 1 point for every correct guess, and once he reaches 12 points in total, Knife Guy will hand over his Bright Card.




Though Mario doesn&#39;t necessarily have to win 12 points in a row, he should try and aim for it. For every wrong guess, Mario will also lose a point. This means that if you choose to guess randomly each time but keep getting it wrong, you won&#39;t be able to get the points needed. So pay attention from the beginning and save yourself some time.



 How To Reach Grate Guy&#39;s Casino 
         

With the Bright Card in hand, head to Bean Valley. In the center of Bean Valley, there will be an area with five pipes, each with a Piranha Plant enemy inside. Defeat the northernmost Pirahna Plant and then proceed down its pipe. Once at the bottom, follow the path until you reach a yellow Chomp Chomp. Defeat this enemy, head to the corner that would&#39;ve been to Chomp Chomp&#39;s left, and jump three times. At this point, an invisible platform will appear above Mario. Use the platform to reach the newly revealed entrance to Grate Guy&#39;s Casino.






It is possible to sell the Bright Card for 777 coins, but Mario will then be unable to access the Casino, even if he&#39;s previously entered it. It can also be sold to a Toad at the Marrymore Inn for 10 Frog Coins. With this option, it can be bought back, but for an upcharge of 15 Frog Coins.




Once inside Grate Guy&#39;s Casino, there will be three mini-games for Mario to choose from. The games include Look The Other Way, a Memory Game, and Prize Blocks. Unlike the original Super Mario RPG, Mario can play all of these mini-games free of charge. In exchange, however, the rewards are also pretty simple, aside from Look The Other Way, which will reward the Star Egg item after 100 wins. From this point, Mario will have complete unlimited access to the Casino in Super Mario RPG Remake as long as he keeps his Bright Card.
