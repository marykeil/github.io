## Literature Review

To battle Crispin in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, players must complete a trial that requires making a Super Spicy Sandwich.





You will need to gather all the ingredients required for the Super-Spicy Sandwich. Unlike most sandwich recipes in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, the ingredients are not easy to gather and will require you to defeat or trade with trainers in the surrounding area.






You will need to follow a few steps as you cannot use the ingredients from your inventory either.

The ingredients required to make a Super-Spicy Sandwich are Mayonnaise, Mustard, Chili Sauce, Jalapeno, and Chorizo. It is important to remember that you cannot use these ingredients if they are already in your inventory, as you need to specifically gather them from NPCs as a part of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. According to GameRant, to gather all of the ingredients for the Super-Spicy Sandwich, here are the steps you need to follow:




  Battle or Pay 50 BP to the &#34;Jalapenos&#34; boy with Black Hair to get Jalapeños.   Defeat a short black-haired NPC next to a Blonde student to get Mayonnaise.   Speak to a blonde student and solve a trivia question to get Egg, Olive Oil, and Vinegar. The answer to the question is Mayonnaise.   Trade the Egg with a short brown-haired student standing next to two other trainers to get Chorizo. Trade Vinegar with the girl trainer to get Mustard.   Speak to the girl near Crispin to get Potato Salad.   Trade the Potato Salad with the boy with short blonde hair to get Cucumber, Onion, and Prosciutto.   Look for a dark-haired girl and trade the Cucumber for Chili Sauce.   Speak to Crispin and craft the Super-Spicy Sandwich.  

Once you speak to Crispin, you can make the Super-Spicy Sandwich by placing Mayonnaise, Mustard, Chili Sauce, Jalapeno, and Chorizo onto the bread. You can finish the sandwich by placing the bread on top or tossing it for a unique dialogue. You will now have created the Super-Spicy Sandwich, completed the trial, and can battle Crispin in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.
