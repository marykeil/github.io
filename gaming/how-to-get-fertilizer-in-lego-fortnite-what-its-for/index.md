## Literature Review

Fertilizer is an important resource for farming crops in LEGO Fortnite. To find it, players must search near animals such as cows and sheep.





Unlike other rarer resources such as LEGO Fortnite’s Marble Slabs, Fertilizer doesn’t need to be crafted or processed from other materials. Instead, it’s a fairly common drop as long as you know where to look, and there are quick and easy ways to collect lots of Fertilizer in LEGO Fortnite’s early, mid, and late-game stages.





 How To Find Fertilizer In LEGO Fortnite 
          

The main way to find Fertilizer in LEGO Fortnite is to collect it from animals such as chickens, cows, and sheep. All of these animals will roam the game’s grasslands biome in small herds, and you can find piles of Fertilizer wherever these herds roam. Fertilizer appears as piles of dung on the ground and isn’t too tricky to spot.



Cows produce Milk, Sheep produce Wool and Chickens produce Eggs. Make sure to collect other resources from animal herds while you’re out collecting Fertilizer.




          




One great way to get even more Fertilizer in LEGO Fortnite is to feed these animals extra crops. Raspberries are the best option; they’re relatively abundant and don’t restore much health or energy when eaten, so they’re best used as animal feed. Drop these crops near an animal, and it will gobble them up, producing extra Fertilizer for your crops.

Apart from chasing after herds and picking up animal dung, you can also get Fertilizer another way. If you’ve recruited some of LEGO Fortnite’s Villagers, they can also hand over Fertilizer if they’re working a resource collection job.

With a resource collection job, your Villagers will explore the nearby biomes and collect useful resources, including Fertilizer. It’s a good option if you’ve got other tasks to do, or if you just want to avoid getting your hands dirty.



You can also fence in these animals to stop them from running away, allowing you to collect Fertilizer easily.









 How To Use Fertilizer In LEGO Fortnite 
          

Fertilizer’s main use in LEGO Fortnite is for placing Garden Plots. Garden Plots require 2 Soil and 1 Fertilizer each and can be placed anywhere in your Village. If you’ve collected seeds, you can plant them in Garden Plots to grow your own crops, such as Corn and Raspberries.



If you’ve recruited some of Fortnite’s friendly NPCS as Villagers, you can tell them to tend to and harvest your crops.




You’ll need to get your hands dirty to collect Fertilizer in LEGO Fortnite. However, the benefits of starting a big crop farm are huge, so you and your friends should make it a priority as you expand your villages.
