## Literature Review

The Special World in Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the eighth map you can explore, but only if you discover all the entrance locations to the area.





There are seven Special World entrances, each in one of the normal Worlds you normally travel through while playing. Unlike the locations of Captain Toad in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, these entrances act like levels, which you must reach by completing stages along a path. You may need to find the secret exits of certain levels in a World to unlock the Special World junctions after beating the main adventure.
