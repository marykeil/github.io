## Literature Review

The classic starters from Red &amp; Blue are all available in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but they require effort to unlock.





Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle can each be found in different specialized biomes run by the Blueberry Academy. While you head to Blueberry Academy at the start of the DLC, you&#39;ll have to progress through the main storyline more before you can start working on the biomes. Follow along, and you&#39;ll be catching starters in no time.





 How To Unlock The League Club 
          

The League Club is a special organization within Blueberry Academy, which the player attends as an exchange student. While missions with the League Club take up much of the DLC&#39;s storyline, you don&#39;t join the League Club when you first arrive at Blueberry Academy. You&#39;ll need to join your new friend Lacey for a bit and play through some of the introductory content.

To unlock the Blueberry Quests (known as BBQs) that will lead to the starter inhabiting the biomes, you&#39;ll need to catch an Alolan Pokémon as part of a Coastal Biome class with Lacey. You can catch an Alolan Pokémon in the area or give the professor an Alolan Pokémon you already have thanks to Pokémon HOME. If you don&#39;t have an Alolan Pokémon, there are plenty in the nearby area for you to catch.




Once you display the Alolan Pokémon to your professor and get a tutorial on BBQs, Carmine will challenge you in the Central Plaza. Her team consists of Toucannon, Mightyena, Scrafty, and Sinistcha. After defeating her, you&#39;ll access all the features of the League Club and start adding starters to your Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet lineup.



Defeating Carmine gives the player access to the Support Board, where you donate Blueberry Points (BP) to other clubs and students in exchange for special rewards. This Support Board is the key feature to unlocking Generation 1 Pokémon in Pokémon: Scarlet and Violet.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 3 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   Starter Pokémon have arrived with the Indigo Disk DLC, including the Treeko, Torchic, and Mudkip from the Gen 3 Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald games.   



 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Bulbasaur 
          




Bulbasaur is the Generation 1 Grass-type Starter from Pokémon Red &amp; Blue, and therefore one of the most popular Pokémon in the franchise. If you want Bulbasaur to spawn in the Indigo Disk DLC, you&#39;ll need to claim the 3,000 BP donation to boost the biodiversity of the Coastal Biome.

This quest, and those connected to the other biomes, are linked to the Support Board and the Teranium Club of Blueberry Academy. By spending 3,000 BP, more Pokémon will spawn in the Coastal Biome, including Bulbasaur.



 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Charmander 
          

Charmander, the famous Generation 1 Fire-type Starter, is connected to the Savannah Biome in the Indigo Disk DLC. For Charmander to spawn within the biome, you&#39;ll have to spend 3,000 BP to boost the Savannah Biome&#39;s biodiversity. Spending BP on this Teranium Club request will not only introduce Charmander to the Savannah Biome but also other Starter Pokémon such as Generation 2 Starters like Totodile.






 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Squirtle 
          

The Generation 1 Water-type Starter Pokémon, Squirtle, can be found in the Canyon Biome once you take on the 3,000 BP biodiversity request for the biome via the Support Board. This adds up to 12,000 BP to unlock and catch all three Generation 1 Pokémon.

Despite the high cost, the nostalgic and emotional value of bringing Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle on your adventures through Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet cannot be understated.
