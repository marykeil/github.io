# One Path Leads To The Loneliest Tav Story Possible In Baldur s Gate 3


## SUMMARY 



  Companions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can be killed or driven away through player choices in each act, providing multiple routes for losing their support.   Act 1 alone has many choices that can result in the death or abandonment of several companions, limiting the party&#39;s options for support.   Act 2 and Act 3 also provide opportunities to permanently remove companions through decisions made during quests and encounters, resulting in a potential lonely journey for the player character.

## Literature Review

Depending on the choices you make in Baldur’s Gate 3, your Tav can end up killing or removing most of their companions, creating a lonely journey.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 doesn&#39;t give Tav&#39;s companions plot armor, and that means there are multiple ways to kill them throughout the game&#39;s three acts. However, killing companions isn&#39;t the only way to lose them. Certain choices made during main story quests or as part of their companions&#39; quests can result in the companions leaving Tav of their own free will. And once they leave like that, they can&#39;t be brought back to the party.




Act 1 alone includes decisions that result in the death or abandonment of multiple companions. One choice in particular removes three companions from the party, with two leaving and the last one becoming unavailable to recruit. When aiming for a playthrough that leaves Tav alone without the company of Origin characters, there are multiple routes to take to drive off any help aside from Hirelings.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Killing &amp; Driving Away Companions In Act 1 
Most Companions Can Be Removed Early On
         

If the Dark Urge is the main character in BG3 instead of a custom Tav, then one of the earliest companions that can be permanently killed off is Gale. When interacting with the portal he&#39;s stuck in, the Dark Urge can sever his hand and kill him as a result. However, a custom Tav can drive away Gale in Act 1 as well by refusing to give him magic items. He&#39;ll leave the party, and that means that he can&#39;t be recruited again. Astarion can also be killed when he tries to bite Tav in the night, but after learning he&#39;s a Vampire Spawn, Tav can meet the Gur Hunter and give Astarion over to him, also removing him permanently.




In Act 1, however, Wyll, Karlach, and Halsin are the other easy options to remove from Tav&#39;s party. Karlach can be killed to complete Wyll&#39;s quest and please Mizora. But by opting to join the Goblins and raid the Grove, Tav loses three companions. Wyll and Karlach leave the party in disgust, and Halsin can&#39;t be recruited in the future due to this decision. Then, Minthara can be killed after raiding the Grove, which eliminates her as a companion as well. And finally, Lae&#39;zel leaves the party at the crèche if her approval is too low and Tav consistently goes against the Githyanki there.



 Act 2 Companion Losses Through Death &amp; Decisions 
Preventing Jaheira &amp; Halsin From Joining
          

Act 2 doesn&#39;t have as many opportunities to lose companions as Act 1, but there are a few cases where Tav&#39;s decisions kill or drive off companions. The first is if the Grove wasn&#39;t attacked and Halsin is present. Not completing his quest with Thaniel results in him staying behind in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, meaning he won&#39;t be a companion. Similarly, Jaheira can be prevented from joining the party in a few ways, mainly not talking with her, letting her die during the attack on Moonrise Towers, or by killing Nightsong.




                  Should You Enter The Shadowfell Before Moonrise Towers In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3?   The best order to proceed through Act 2 in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t always clear, but one approach makes it possible to avoid missing content.   

Encountering Nightsong is also a point where Shadowheart can be removed from the party, since Tav can fight her to save Nightsong if convincing her with words doesn&#39;t work. At the end of Act 2, Wyll can be permanently removed if he&#39;s still in the party as well. This is done by killing Mizora in her pod in the Mind Flayer Colony instead of rescuing her. The punishment he receives for failing his task and killing his patron results in his removal from the group.



 Act 3 Companion Removal Opportunities 
Final Chance For A Lonely Tav
          

A lot of companion quests wrap up in Act 3, and a few of them include chances to remove companions. Since the majority of quests, aside from facing the Netherbrain, can be done in any order, Tav can choose to start with any option, assuming that they still have the companions associated with that quest. Shadowheart is fairly easy to remove at this point; when Tav brings her to face Viconia, Tav can choose to give Shadowheart to the Sharrans in exchange for their help against the Netherbrain, thereby removing her from the party.




                  The Funniest Content In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Is Hidden In An Act 3 Side Area   Some of the best Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 content is off the beaten path, and taking some diversions can lead to memorable gags and exciting encounters.   

Astarion can also be removed if he&#39;s taken to Cazador&#39;s Palace and not saved from the ritual before Cazador completes it. In this case, he&#39;s absorbed by Cazador as he becomes a Vampire Ascendant, and not even Withers can bring him back from that. There&#39;s also the chance to recruit Minsc in Act 3, but without Jaheira, recruiting Minsc is impossible. Finally, Gale can be killed in the final battle by asking him to use the Orb in his chest. Since the final fight takes place on the surface, he removes the rest of the party from the area so that he&#39;s the only one to die with the enemies.



 Removing Companions During Long Rests 
Dependent On When Rests Are Taken
          




For these cases, the act in which the scene is triggered depends on when the party takes a Long Rest. The primary companions who can die during these scenes are Shadowheart and Lae&#39;zel. In Astarion&#39;s case, his biting scene is almost always triggered in Act 1, so that was included above. However, Tav will be woken up during a rest by Lae&#39;zel about to kill Shadowheart, and they can either mediate the situation, or side with one to kill the other. If Shadowheart is killed here, then Tav has a chance later to kill Lae&#39;zel, thereby removing both from the party.

After killing Shadowheart, there&#39;s a Long Rest where Tav is feverish and about to turn into an Illithid. Lae&#39;zel shows up with the intention of killing Tav, and Tav can turn the tables and kill Lae&#39;zel instead, convincing her that she&#39;s the one who&#39;s too far gone to save. Or Tav can simply fight Lae&#39;zel here instead of trying to trick her, which also removes her from the party forever. A similar situation can happen with Wyll and Karlach during the first Long Rest with both of them present after Mizora shows up, giving Tav the option to kill Karlach in order to save Wyll.




Of the many variations of endings that exist in BG3, Tav without any Origin characters left to help them and relying on Hirelings instead is among the more depressing options. It also removes a lot of content and lore for those Origin characters, since companion quests revolve around a specific character being present and participating in them. At the very least, Withers&#39; reunion party will be rather quiet if Tav has killed or driven away all their companions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
