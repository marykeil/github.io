## Literature Review

Mario Kart 8 has received a balancing update that has changed the meta once again to include some interesting new viable combinations.





However, the gap between the best and worst combinations is not as wide as it once was. This means that skilled players can still win first place with a build that isn&#39;t necessarily top-tier in terms of stats. However, using some of the new meta builds to give that extra boost could help players have better odds, but keep in mind, the meta doesn&#39;t guarantee a win every time either.









 








 10  Iggy &amp; Inkstriker 
With Rollers And The Paper Glider
        

Iggy is probably one of the less common options when selecting a racer, but this new update is bound to change that. Pairing Iggy with the Inkstriker creates a combination that can become a nightmare for opponents.
However, with the Rollers&#39; additional stat increase and the mini-turbo boost, Iggy has no trouble going from last to first on any Mario Kart 8 Deluxe track. This makes this build a solid option for players who tend to encounter more obstacles in their race than normal, as it will allow for an easier time re-adjusting after a wipeout.





 9  King Boo &amp; Cat Cruiser 
With Rollers And The Standard Glider
        

King Boo might be a solid choice, but the Cat Cruiser is where the heart of this build lies. The Cat Cruiser has quickly risen to the top of the list as one of the best Kart options in the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only does this build have the speed and acceleration to achieve an easy win, but the traction and handling shine.
For players who have a hard time with sharp turns and navigating their way around maps, this build is perfect. Turns that would normally have King Boo ramming into the sidelines feel almost seamless with the combination of the Cat Cruiser and Roller Wheels.





 8  Rosalina &amp; Teddy Buggy 
With Rollers &amp; The Paper Glider
        

Every Mario Kart 8 Deluxe player has seen the previous meta featuring Rosalina and her cozy Teddy Kart. It was a severely broken build in the Wave 4 update and although it is no longer considered the meta, at least Rosalina isn&#39;t, it is still a solid option that can get the job done.
Whether inexperienced or seasoned, this kart setup in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe can help secure a win with its massive acceleration and mini-turbo boost, even on difficult Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tracks like Rainbow Road. On top of that, its balanced weight and traction make it easy to control, something that can&#39;t be said for many of the light, speedy, combos in the game.





 7  Luigi &amp; Streetle 
With Rollers And The Parachute
        

When factoring in all overall stats, Luigi is one of the best racers in the game. While not too bulky, Luigi is still able to maintain a decent weight with good handling and traction. This also means that he has a pretty fair speed and acceleration balance. The Streetle Kart got an increase in Ground Speed in the Wave 5 update, helping it reach pretty decent speeds and be one of the best options in the game.
The Rollers also give a small boost that just adds to the benefits of this Kart. This build may not be the top-tier option, but it is a very viable option for seasoned players looking to test their skills with something that doesn&#39;t offer an easy win, but also keeps it within reach.





 6  Funky Kong &amp; Mr. Scooty 
With Rollers And The Cloud Glider


 







Funky Kong is a character that many were delighted to see make a return to Mario Kart in Wave 6. However, he unfortunately didn&#39;t come with great stats and is overall comparable to Wario in terms of his base character stats. That being said, he is not completely un-viable either.
For those looking to play Funky Kong, pairing him with Mr. Scooty, Rollers, and the Cloud Glider are a great way to make up for some of his more unfortunate stats. However, Teddy Buggy with the same attachments is also a good option for this character for those who aren&#39;t tired of that Kart.
Regardless of which combo is selected, Funky Kong will just have an overall harder time going up against meta combos. 






 5  Pauline &amp; Mr. Scooty 
With Rollers And The Cloud Glider


 







Pauline, another new character in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with Wave 6 is another option that is completely viable against some of the more obvious meta choices. While she technically could be paired with the Teddy Buggy for a better balance of stats, Mr. Scooty ensures better handling for tighter turns in 200cc races.
Pairing Pauline with Mr. Scooty means players only miss out on a slight mini-turbo disadvantage compared to the meta, which, for those who have more overall skill, is likely to go unnoticed. This combination is a great option for racers looking for something a little more unique with great stats.





 4  Kamek &amp; Teddy Buggy 
With Roller Wheels &amp; The Paper Glider
        

Making his debut in the Wave 5 update of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Kamek has made a strong first impression by being part of the previous meta and now, the current one. Though he isn&#39;t necessarily the best racer in the game, Kamek is a solid choice as, even though he may require a sacrifice in mini-turbo stats, he makes up for it with an equal increase in overall speed.
Not every player is looking to be confined to the often overplayed meta characters, so this is a great alternative that still holds a fair shot at pulling out the win in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Though there is some flexibility among the top choices between characters and Karts, the Roller Wheels and Lightweight gliders are undeniably some of the best options for Kart attachments, regardless of whatever other options are selected to be paired with them. 






 3  Birdo &amp; Cat Cruiser 
With Rollers And The Paper Glider


 







Both Birdo and Yoshi hold top spots in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe now, as medium-weight characters are significantly better options than their light-weight or heavy-weight counterparts. Additionally, since several characters share similar stats and two Kart options that are both equally viable, players potentially have more options than ever in building their perfect combo while utilizing the meta.
Birdo paired with the Cat Cruiser, Rollers, and virtually any lightweight glider is a pairing that will make any opponent nervous. One perk that Birdo holds over some of her similarly stated friends is the different color options, allowing for a little more of a unique feel.

Birdo comes to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as an additional racer that players can unlock when they purchase downloadable content for Wave 4 of the game.








 2  Yoshi &amp; Teddy Buggy 
With Rollers And The Cloud Glider


 







Though players are probably tired of seeing this combination as it held the high point in the previous meta, unfortunately, this is still one of the best combinations in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Yoshi, alongside Peachette, Daisy, and Birdo, remains one of the best characters in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe stat-wise.
The perfect pairing for him, Teddy Buggy, has also been part of the meta in several variations over the last several Waves and stat changes, and since Wave 6 concludes DLC content, for now at least, Teddy Buggy will likely remain in the meta permanently. Match these two with Rollers and the Cloud Glider and this pair will prove as valuable as it has been previously.





 1  Peachette &amp; Cat Cruiser 
With Roller Wheels And The Paper Glider


 







New to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in Wave 6 is the lovely Peachette. Though this was a shocking addition to the roster, considering there were already four variations of Peach in the game and players were hoping for completely new characters, Peachette is now the new, and potentially final, meta. Though she may not have the overall speed that some players are looking for, the mini-turbo stat is truly what makes the difference here.
Though Teddy Buggy is also a great option here, for those looking for something of equal greatness but more original, pairing her with the Cat Cruiser, Rollers, and any lightweight glider is a combo that is sure to make all Mario Kart 8 Deluxe races lean more in your favor.
