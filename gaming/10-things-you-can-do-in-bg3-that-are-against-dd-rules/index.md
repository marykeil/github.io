## Literature Review

There are some differences between Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and D&amp;D when it comes to abilities and actions that mean that some D&amp;D rules are getting broken.




Baldur’s Gate 3 all takes place on the Sword Coast, an area in the Forgotten Realms, which is the default setting for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Along with the world, BG3 uses a modified version of DnD fifth edition rules to bring the adventure to life. However, changes have obviously had to be made to translate the tabletop experience to a video game. While some of these are relatively small, others could cause confusion for new players joining DnD from BG3; there are some things in the game that bend or even break the TTRPG rules.
Overall, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 does a fantastic job of bringing DnD into another medium and the differences between BG3 and DnD, for the most part, work really well. However, with the change to a video game, changes had to be made, some for function and some for fun. While many of the core features of DnD remain the same in BG3, the differences might have some scratching their heads or even inadvertently breaking the rule.

 10  Health Potions As A Bonus Action 
In D&amp;D It Takes An Action
        

In Baldur’s Gate 3, healing potions are incredibly useful, often making all the difference in particularly tough fights. What makes them so great in BG3 as well is that they can be used as a bonus action, meaning that all characters can use their actions on their turn before drinking a potion. However, rules as written in DnD, drinking a health potion takes an action as described in chapter seven of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Many DnD tables use a house rule that allows potions to be drunk as a bonus action, while giving them to another player would use a full action. 






 9  Throwing Healing Potions 
Throwing Items In D&amp;D Does Damage
        

Still on the topic of healing potions, many new DnD players might be surprised that throwing them at their party members won’t heal them. In BG3, a trick many might have missed is that healing potions can be thrown at or near companions to heal them in battle. It is a great way to help a downed party member or heal more than one person at once, as the thrown potions do AOE healing. However, attempting this at the DnD table might get some strange looks, or worse, unintentionally deal damage to an already injured player.





 8  Multiple Magical Items On A Single Character 
BG3 Didn’t Use D&amp;D’s Attunement System


 







There is no better feeling in BG3 than seeing the full party completely equipped with magical items, turning already potent characters into demigods. However, in the interest of balance in DnD, characters are limited in the amount of magical items they can equip. Every DnD character only has three slots available to attune to powerful equipment such as rings, armor, or weapons. Attunement wasn’t included in BG3, and it would be difficult to see how it would have worked in a video game, but this rule change might catch some off guard.





 7  Speaking To Withers For Resurrection 
Bringing Back The Dead Is More Complicated In D&amp;D


 







When a companion dies in BG3, it is a simple matter to get them back with a revive scroll or a chat with Withers. Giving the mysterious skeletal camp companion some gold will have Astarion or Wyll back up and about in no time, but reviving party members is a little more complicated in DnD. While spells like revivify, raise dead and resurrection can help bring back fallen allies, they come with monetary costs and/or time constraints. Raise dead and resurrection also impose a minus-four penalty on the revived character, which is reduced by one each time they long rest to simulate the ordeal of coming back from the dead.
Revivify in DnD must be used within one minute of a character dying, while raise dead and resurrection cost 500g and 1000g respectively. 






 6  Respec Anytime In BG3 
Traditionally Not Allowed In D&amp;D


 







Withers also provides another service in camp, as he can respec any playable BG3 character’s class, allowing for the full party to be completely customized to any play style. This is not something that is often available in DnD campaigns, where a character’s class and skills are usually set unless they multiclass. This is perhaps one area where Dungeon Masters may wish to borrow from BG3, as allowing players to change their characters class if they are not having fun can be integrated into the story.

 5  Shove Is A Bonus Action In BG3 
Shove A Full Action In D&amp;D
        

There is a lot of fun to be had in BG3 from shoving enemies off cliffs or away from squishier party members. Best of all, this can be done as a bonus action, which shifts the action economy in fights in the party’s favor. However, in DnD, shove is a full action, meaning that a player would have to choose between attacking or shoving an enemy. DnD has awesome rules that people never use that are similar to shove, like shove aside, overrun, and tumble, which are fun to work into campaigns.





 4  Help Works Differently In BG3 
Help Has Different Functions In D&amp;D
        

Another action that doesn’t function the same way in DnD as it does in BG3 is the help action. In BG3, the help action primarily acts as a way to get downed party members on their feet if they are making death saves in battle, which is very useful if out of healing potions or spells. However, help is used in DnD to give advantage to other characters when making attack rolls or skill checks.

There are more things DnD players can do with their actions than just attack, but one of the most useful is often overlooked and misunderstood.








 3  Swapping Out Spells Anytime in BG3 
D&amp;D Requires A Long Rest To Change Spells


 







One of the great parts of playing as a spellcaster in BG3 is the plethora of awesome spells at the character&#39;s disposal. BG3 makes it really easy for spellcasters when compared to DnD, as they are able to swap spells out at any time. So long as that character isn&#39;t in combat, BG3 allows a window to be opened and spells to be changed. However, most spellcasters in DnD who can swap out spells, such as druids or clerics, can only do so during a long rest, meaning that spells need to be chosen more carefully.





 2  Druids Can Be Owlbears In BG3 
D&amp;D Druids Can Only Wild Shape Into Beasts
        

Despite featuring in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves and BG3, druids in DnD cannot turn into owlbears. It is awesome being an owlbear in the game, and it is one of the coolest wild shapes in BG3, but in DnD, owlbears are classed as monstrosities rather than beasts. Individual DMs may be persuaded to allow the large creatures to be used, though.





 1  Cast Two Spells In One Turn In BG3 
In D&amp;D, One Would Need To Be A Cantrip
        

Finally, one of the biggest changes that breaks the rules of DnD revolves around spellcasting. In Baldur’s Gate 3, spellcasters can cast two leveled spells in one turn, so long as one can be cast using a bonus action. In DnD, however, two spells cannot be cast in the same turn. If a spellcaster casts a spell, they can only cast a cantrip in the same turn. For example, a healing word is a bonus action spell, which would allow a cantrip such as sacred flame to be used.
