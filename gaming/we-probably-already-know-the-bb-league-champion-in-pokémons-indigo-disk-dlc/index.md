# We Probably Already Know The BB League Champion In Pokémons Indigo Disk DLC


## SUMMARY 



  The identity of the BB League Champion in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC is likely to be a familiar face.   Kieran&#39;s storyline and character development in The Teal Mask suggest that he may become a more villainous character in The Indigo Disk, constantly seeking battles to prove his power.   If Kieran does become the Champion, he will finally be on equal terms with the protagonist, making their rematch a climactic and highly anticipated battle in the DLC.

## Literature Review

Close examination of the trailers for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC suggests a familiar face is likely Champion of the BB League. 




It seems extremely likely that the identity of the BB League Champion in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s upcoming Indigo Disk DLC will actually be a familiar face. While only the League’s Elite Four have been publicly revealed, the existence of an additional Champion figure seems all but certain. Moreover, given prior content, the probable identity of this Champion is relatively easy to deduce.




Judging by the promotional material released so far, the BB League will be a prominent part of The Indigo Disk. As the League’s Elite Four, Lacey, Crispin, Amarys, and Drayton are clearly prominent figures at the height of Blueberry Academy’s social structure. But in every previous example of an Elite Four, there has always been a Champion to battle afterwards. With Geeta’s team in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet being generally considered disappointingly underwhelming, a new and more challenging opponent in a similar position would be highly appreciated by many people, and it seems that such a battle is indeed being set up.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Teal Mask DLC Final Boss &amp; Ending Explained (In Detail)   The ending of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC features a long boss battle and special teasers for the Indigo Disk expansion.    


 Kieran’s Glove Could Be The Key To Identifying The BB League Champion 
          




Given trailer shots of an unidentified figure with a familiar red glove, and his character arc so far, it has been heavily theorized that the Champion of the BB League will in fact be Kieran. Carmine’s younger brother was last seen developing an unhealthy fixation on growing stronger as a trainer in The Teal Mask, and climbing to the top of Blueberry Academy’s battle scene would be a natural course of action for Kieran to take as a result. This same storyline could also easily see Kieran become a more villainous character in The Indigo Disk, perhaps by constantly forcing battles in a desire to prove his power.

It is a foregone conclusion that Kieran will feature strongly in The Indigo Disk, given the storyline of The Teal Mask. With that in mind, his near-complete absence from promotional material for the next part of Scarlet and Violet’s DLC is a curious point of interest. Kieran cna be seen in the DLC’s main poster image, but otherwise has yet to be seen, indicating that details of his whereabouts and activities are intended are being deliberately held in reserve for the time being. A surprise reappearance as the BB League Champion would undoubtedly benefit from this, whether in a final trailer to build anticipation or during the DLC itself.





 

In contrast, having an Elite Four without a Champion would make the entire structure of the Blueberry League seem incomplete. Even Alola’s newly-established Pokémon League in Pokémon Sun and Moon has Professor Kukui providing a final battle to continue the tradition (whilst Hau fulfills the same function in Ultra Sun and Moon). After nine Generations of Pokémon games establishing precedent, the existence of an Elite Four necessitates the existence of a Champion, or at the very least a comparative figure. And although an unknown new character could technically fill this role in The Indigo Disk, Kieran is undoubtedly a far more logical choice.



Uniquely, players must beat an Elite Trial before being able to battle each of the Blueberry League&#39;s Elite Four.









 Kieran Could Still Have A Long Road To The Championship 
          

However, it is also entirely possible that Kieran may not actually be the Champion at the beginning of The Indigo Disk, and will instead rise to that position over the course of the DLC whilst acting as a rival figure once again. This would provide a source of ongoing conflict throughout the DLC, especially if the player character constantly tries and fails to reason with him. The Indigo Disk is quickly shaping up to be better than The Teal Mask in many ways, and an engaging storyline like this would definitely contribute to its overall success

In this version of events, Kieran would likely achieve the Championship position just ahead of the player character. Naturally, a final confrontation would then follow, perhaps even feeding into whatever storyline will be presented surrounding Terapagos. Regardless of any connection to the new Legendary Pokémon, however, it is clear that Kieran will pose one of the most challenging battles in the entire DLC at this point. Assuming that his behavior can be changed to a friendlier outlook once more, this change will presumably happen following his final defeat at this stage, if not before.




Of course, if all of this does come to pass, then Kieran wouldn&#39;t be the first rival character to tread this path. Blue in the original Pokémon Red and Blue games has the same character arc, ultimately becoming the Champion immediately prior to Red completing his own Elite Four challenge. Just like Blue, this would then mean Kieran would only enjoy his Champion status for mere moments before being defeated once again by the player character. In some respects, it is easy to sympathize with Kieran and his self-perceived inadequacies in such a scenario, but the potential of him being an antagonistic force alongside this cannot be ignored.



 BB League Champion Kieran Would Be The Endgame Protagonist&#39;s Equal 
         

If Kieran does become the Champion, then after the events in Kitakami this will place him on equal terms with the protagonist at last. Most people will have completed the base Scarlet and Violet games ahead of the DLC’s release, making them Champion-ranked trainers by the time they visit Kitakami, whilst The Indigo Disk could easily be set after the conclusion of the main storyline in any case. Either way, the player character will almost certainly be a Champion when they become an exchange student at Blueberry Academy. As Kieran’s own efforts to become stronger seem set to parallel the protagonist’s, he will become their true equal as a result.




                  One Pokémon’s Battle Item Proves A Secret Evolution Is Coming In The Indigo Disk   An interaction between a Pokémon and a held item in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s DLC indicates a new, currently unrevealed evolution is on the way.    

The next part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero is sure to still have some surprises in store, and Kieran’s future status is technically one of those points, albeit one that is easy to predict with reasonable confidence; He is by far the most likely candidate for the position of Champion in The Indigo Disk. But even so, this conclusion does not detract from the anticipation; if anything, the inferred promise of a climactic rematch does the opposite. It is clear that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is only going to get better with its next portion of DLC, and Kieran will certainly help make it worth the wait.
