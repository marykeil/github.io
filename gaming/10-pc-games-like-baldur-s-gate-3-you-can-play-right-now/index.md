## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is definitely incredible, but it&#39;s not the only game in its genre to deliver a fantastically compelling RPG experience on PC.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 might seem like a phenomenon unto itself, but there are plenty of other great options to find a similar brand of enjoyment on PC. The original Baldur&#39;s Gate was only one computer RPG among a rash of excellent titles that hit in the late 90s, and games that stay loyal to classic elements of the formula have continued to be released over the years. From fantasy classics to recent innovations, there&#39;s something for everyone who had a blast with Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
One of the most important aspects of a game like Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the legitimacy and variety of choices, which uphold the feeling of freedom and creativity that makes a great RPG sing. Most also feature engaging combat systems, although that isn&#39;t necessarily a must if interesting skill checks and dialogue paths serve to carry the progression and challenge. Everything needs to be packaged into a compelling story with interesting characters and scenarios, as few things can make an RPG boring as quickly as an uninspired narrative can.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Icewind Dale (2000) 
Black Isle Studios
        

The original Baldur&#39;s Gate games are something of a given when it comes to titles like Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but they aren&#39;t the only excellent DnD adaptations set in the world of the Forgotten Realms. Icewind Dale takes matters north to a much colder climate and focuses more on challenging combat, making it a perfect pick for anyone who enjoys strategic mastery. The story isn&#39;t quite as strong as the Baldur&#39;s Gate games, but it certainly holds up in its own right.

Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale are the weirdest entries from Black Isle&#39;s D&amp;D phase, but that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t worth playing.








 9  Shadowrun: Dragonfall (2014) 
Harebrained Schemes
        

Shadowrun Returns successfully brought a classic TTRPG franchise back to the world of video game RPGs after decades away, but its successor, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, is the one that&#39;s a must-play. Dragonfall improves on virtually everything about Returns, with a stronger plot and tactical combat encounters alike. This is the perfect pick for anyone interested in fantasy elements in a more futuristic setting thanks to its immediately engaging world and characters.





 8  Solasta: Crown of the Magister (2020) 
Tactical Adventures


 







Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t the only DnD-based, classically styled CRPG to come out during the fifth edition era, although its main competitor isn&#39;t quite as official. Solata: Crown of the Magister utillizes the System Reference Document to make a perfectly legitimate unlicensed adaptation, which prohibits it from using a number of specific references to settings, creatures, and characters. Since it&#39;s based on the same ruleset, it&#39;s easy to pick up for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players, and its tactical combat makes similarly strong use of verticality.

Solasta: Crown of the Magister is one of the few TTRPG inspired games to really properly translate the systems into the video game format.








 7  Wasteland 3 (2020) 
inXile Entertainment
        

The modern Wasteland games could be considered successors to both the original Wasteland and to the isometric Fallout games that it inspired, following the latter&#39;s style while modernizing affairs. Wasteland 3 is the easiest to jump into for the first time, streamlining some elements of Wasteland 2 while making others more robust. The world of Wasteland 3 heavily accounts for player choices and interactions, making it a perfect alternative to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.





 6  Pillars of Eternity (2015) 
Obsidian Entertainment
        

Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has tons of dialogue, most individual lines are fairly short, making the overall voice acting load at least a little bit manageable. Pillars of Eternity goes in the opposite direction, and it&#39;s not a friendly experience for anyone who doesn&#39;t much care for reading. If constant exposure to rich fantasy lore and an interesting story does sound appealing, Pillars of Eternity is one of the strongest modern CRPGs, as is its followup, Deadfire.

Avowed takes place in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, but not every spell or character ability from PoE will fit Avowed&#39;s gameplay.








 5  Dragon Age: Origins (2009) 
BioWare


 







Dragon Age: Origins may not look as much like Baldur&#39;s Gate as, well, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 does, but it represents an earlier attempt at modernizing that legacy in at least some form. Created by original Baldur&#39;s Gate developer BioWare, Dragon Age: Origins tells an involving fantasy story, and the combat system is still fairly fun despite its comparative simplicity. It&#39;s also a standard-bearer for party romances, and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 likely took its fair share of inspiration from the Dragon Age series in that regard.





 4  Disco Elysium (2019) 
ZA/UM
        

As far as modern CRPGs go, Disco Elysium is substantially different from Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it shares the status of being a truly standout entry in the genre. Disco Elysium doesn&#39;t have an actual combat system, focusing on other ways to progress in a fascinating investigation story. Anyone who thrills at the skill checks of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will find plenty to love in Disco Elysium, and it&#39;s worth checking out simply as a masterpiece in its own right.





 3  Planescape: Torment (1999) 
Black Isle Studios
        

If the strangeness of the illithid element in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a major draw, the unusual DnD setting of Planescape: Torment is the logical place to turn. Darker and weirder than the other DnD CRPGs, Planescape: Torment is full of fascinating puzzles, characters, and ideas. While Icewind Dale tipped the Baldur&#39;s Gate balance of story and combat toward combat, Planescape: Torment rebalances the scales in the opposite direction, so it might not be the first choice for anyone looking for constant action.

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the obvious choice for modern Dungeons &amp; Dragons video gaming, but there are plenty of other titles that still hold up today.








 2  Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (2021) 
Owlcat Games
        

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous might be the most direct competitor to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in some regards, spinning an elaborate and visually impressive CRPG out of the Pathfinder system that was built off of DnD 3.5e to provide a tabletop alternative. As seems to be a common theme in the genre, Wrath of the Righteous made significant improvements from the compelling but flawed Pathfinder: Kingmaker that preceded it. This is an especially good choice for anyone who puts interesting party characters first and foremost, an area where Wrath of the Righteous excels.





 1  Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017) 
Larian Studios


 







Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is different from Divinity, but it wouldn&#39;t exist if developer Larian Studios hadn&#39;t first made the series, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 represents a staggering peak for the franchise. Although DnD 5e rules are nowhere to be seen, so much of the reactivity and depth that sets Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 apart comes from its predecessors. With consistent excellence across every element of its design – and the familiar inclusion of co-op party mechanics – Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a perfect alternative to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
               Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Developer(s):   Larian Studios    Franchise:   Baldur&#39;s Gate    Genre(s):   RPG    Platform(s):   macOS, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5    Publisher(s):   Larian Studios    ESRB:   M    Summary:   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a long-anticipated sequel to Baldur&#39;s Gate 2, released in 2000 from BioWare and now being handled by Larian Studios. Set 120 years after the events of Shadows of Amn, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 puts players in the role of a customizable protagonist who has been captured and infected with a parasite that will turn them into a mind flayer. Before the process is complete, the ship they are on crashes, leaving them on a quest to cure themselves as they meet up with other survivors. Gameplay is turn-based and can be played co-operatively online or tackled alone in a single-player campaign with NPC allies.     Prequel:   Baldur&#39;s Gate 2    Released:   2023-08-31    How Long To Beat:   50 - 100 hours
