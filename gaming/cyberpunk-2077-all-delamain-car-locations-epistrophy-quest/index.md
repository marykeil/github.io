## Literature Review

To complete the Epistrophy Side Job quest in Cyberpunk 2077, players must search Night City for seven runaway Delamain Cabs with rogue AI. 





To get the questline started, you must speak to the taxi AI in Delamain HQ. The AI will give V a special Scanner that will let them locate rogue Delamain taxis scattered around the city. Some cars in Cyberpunk 2077 will be easy to find; however, many of them will require some extra effort to recover. Regardless, if you are looking to wrap up this questline fast, you will require the exact locations of every Delamain taxi so that you don&#39;t have to spend too much time exploring.




                  Cyberpunk 2077: All Free Car and Vehicle Locations   Cyberpunk 2077 lets players drive through Night City in tons of different vehicles. A lot of them pricey, but there are plenty of free cars to find.    


 How To Find Delamain Cars 
          

Before venturing out to look for Delamain taxis in Wellsprings, it is worth pointing out that some of the cars face emotional problems and will not go back to the HQ easily. You will be required to do some tasks in order to calm the taxis. For further details about each Delamain car location and encounter, players can refer to the index below. Finding all the Delamain cars can take quite a bit of time, but fortunately ZaFrostPet on YouTube has provided an extremely helpful visual breakdown if players want to simply see where all the Delamain cars are located:





 



 Delamain Car Location In Wellsprings 
          

 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Heywood   Sub-District: Wellsprings       After players arrive at the Cab&#39;s location in Wellsprings, the hostile taxi will attempt to run over V, after which the rogue AI will exclaim a vulgar greeting and drive off.   Chasing after the Cab on foot is impractical, so players should be prepared to give chase with their own vehicle.   To subdue this Cab, players must continue to deal damage to the car until it gives up.   Attack the vehicle by ramming it while driving or by shooting it with any weapon in Cyberpunk 2077.      





 Delamain Car Location In Northside 
          

 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Watson   Sub-District: Northside       This Delamain car will be parked in a small alleyway in Northside.   When you approach the vehicle, it will suddenly become active, darting off through the industrial sector.   Drive after the Cab, chasing it through the dirt trails and empty warehouses. Don&#39;t worry about damaging it.   Eventually, the car will reach a fixed location where it will crash into a pile of trash, concluding the quest objective.      








 Delamain Car Location In North Oak 
          

 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Westbrook   Sub-District: North Oak       This next Delamain car can be found driving slowly and endlessly within a roundabout on the outskirt roads of North Oak.   After a chat with V, Delamain will express their disdain for the loud and crowded life in the city.   It does not wish to return to Delamain HQ on its own but instead requests that players get into its driver&#39;s seat and manually return it.   Although it asks that players drive carefully and not crash, there is no penalty for doing so.   However, if you drive relentlessly for an extended period, Delamain will force V to drop driving for several seconds.      





 Delamain Car Location In Rancho Coronado 
          

 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Santo Domingo   Sub-District: Rancho Coronado       In the southeastern neighborhoods of Rancho Coronado, the next Delamain Car is driving aimlessly through the streets.   Delamain claims that the flamingo decorations outside people&#39;s homes are tormenting its mind.   Therefore, to peacefully bring this Artificial intelligence in Cyberpunk 2077 back to HQ, you must follow the HUD markers and destroy the flamingos in yards of the neighborhood.   Players can destroy flamingos with vehicles or with their weapon of choice.      





 Delamain Car Location In Badlands 
          




 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Red Peaks   Sub-District: Badlands       This is one of the easiest Delamain car to find in Cyberpunk 2077.   All you must do is approach the Cab, climb into the backseat, and speak with the rogue AI for less than a minute.   Once the conversation is over, Delamain will call V and send the Eddies to your account.   The only challenge is getting through all the garbage along the narrow roads of the Badlands; the collision boxes of the trash heaps can be annoying to deal with.      





 Delamain Car Location In The Glen 
          

 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Heywood   Sub-District: The Glen       Similar to the runaway Cab in the Badlands, the Delamain car located in The Glen only wishes to speak with V before agreeing to go back to the taxi headquarters.      





 The Last Delamain Car Location: Coastview 
          

 Delamain Cab Location  Walkthrough Details     District: Pacifica   Sub-District: Coastview       The final Delamain car encounter will begin similar to the Cab chase in Northside.   You will be forced to chase after the vehicle through the streets of Pacifica; however, this Cab has a surprise ambush in store along the way.   After pursuing Delamain, it will eventually stop beneath an underpass where a group of Gangoons will attempt to kill V.   Fortunately, there are plenty of debris and objects to use as cover while defeating these hostile enemies.   After clearing the area, speak with the Delamain car again to persuade it to return to Delamain HQ.      



After you return the last Delamain Taxi, you can head back to Delamain HQ to return the scanner. You will receive some Eddies and EXP for your efforts and for completing this major side gig. 




To start the next Delamain quest in Cyberpunk 2077, &#34;Don&#39;t Lose Your Mind,&#34; you need to head to Corpo Plaza in Night City, where you will learn of a traffic jam caused by three Delamain Cabs. Johnny Silverhand will advise that V should visit the headquarters to see what is going on, triggering the next part of Delamain&#39;s story, where players will have to make an important decision about the AI&#39;s fate.
