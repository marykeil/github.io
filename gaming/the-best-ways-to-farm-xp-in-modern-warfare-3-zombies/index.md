## Literature Review

Farming XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is different from past titles, with the massive map providing new ways to best defeat waves of undead hordes.





One of the easiest ways to earn experience fast comes from expending a Double XP Token, a reward for playing matches in Modern Warfare 3&#39;s multiplayer. The boost this Token provides only lasts for a limited time, so use it wisely. It&#39;s always better to farm XP with a squad than alone since your rewards are usually increased if you play with more people.

 How To Farm XP Fast In Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

The fastest way to farm XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies comes from completing Daily Challenges, staying at exfil points to wipe out zombie hordes, and not using the Nuke. This last option may sound strange since the Nuke is one of the strongest tools to wipe out every undead near your squad. However, activating this device should be a final gambit because it will reward you with no XP for any zombie it kills.

Daily Challenges are a quick way to grab some experience, usually offering around 2500 XP or more for finishing incredibly simple tasks. These can range from getting 30 kills while driving a vehicle to just drinking three cans of Perk-A-Cola in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. You can unlock Armory Challenges that level up specific weapons if you also manage to meet the objectives for every Daily task.






Make sure to deploy your strongest and highest-level weapons to take out zombies as fast as they appear in the most dangerous infected zones.




A small exploit that works best for farming experience occurs when you call for a helicopter during an exfil. You or everyone on your squad must enter the vehicle called upon to leave Urzikstan, but you can delay your departure. Even if you have exceeded the 45-minute time limit for a deployment, you can defend the helicopter from zombie hordes for as long as you want in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.

Calling the helicopter repeatedly is the best way to farm XP in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies because your team can take out wave after wave of undead before leaving.
