## Literature Review

Hanya is a new 4-star support Harmony character in Honkai: Star Rail. Here are all the materials you need to farm to fully max her out.





Hanya operates differently than most of the other Harmony characters so far. Her Skill allows the team to recover Skill Points when they land hits on opponents marked by her, while her Ultimate boosts an ally’s SPD and ATK, making her good company for a DPS like Seele in Honkai: Star Rail, for instance. Because Hanya is a 4-star character, the amount of resources needed for her Ascension and Trace-leveling process is much inferior to that required for 5-star characters. Nevertheless, there is a fair amount of farming involved in getting Hanya and her abilities to the maximum level.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Topaz Character Ascension (&amp; Materials)   To start unlocking Topaz and Numby’s full potential in Honkai: Star Rail, you first need to Ascend and level both the character and her Traces.   


 Ascension Materials To Farm For Hanya In Honkai: Star Rail 
         

When farming materials for Hanya, the first thing you will need to go after is the item family that encompasses Artifex’s Module, Artifex’s Cogwheel, and Artifex’s Gyreheart. They are connected to each other in the sense that Cogwheel is Module’s next evolution, while Gyreheart is the last form in the item family. The Artifex materials are commonly dropped from Entranced Ingenium opponents, which, in turn, can be found across the Xianzhou Luofu maps in Honkai: Star Rail, especially in Stargazer Navalia. For reference, these are the mechanical constructs that resemble animals – the Ingenium category includes the Illumination Dragonfish, the Golden Cloud Toad, and the Obedient Dracolion.






You can also get this material from the Embers Exchange store, as rewards for Assignments, and the Simulated Universe.




As an item family, you will need to use the Synthesizer to craft higher-quality materials – 3x Modules can become 1x Cogwheel, and 3x Cogwheels can be transformed into 1x Gyreheart. The second important material to farm for Hanya’s Ascension is Netherworld Pass, as pointed out by Honey Hunter World. This item drops from Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Perdition, a new challenge added in Honkai: Star Rail 1.5, which means it could not be farmed prior to the release of the update. A total of 50x Netherworld Pass is needed to get Hanya to level 80, so you will need to challenge the Stagnant Shadow multiple times.

The table below details all the required materials for Hanya’s complete Ascension, including the detailed amount per level threshold:




 Hanya Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Honkai: Star Rail   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    4x Artifex&#39;s Module   3,200x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 30 Ascension    8x Artifex&#39;s Module   6,400x Credits     -   Level 40 Ascension    5x Artifex&#39;s Cogwheel   2x Netherworld Pass   12,800x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 50 Ascension    8x Artifex&#39;s Cogwheel   5x Netherworld Pass   32,000x Credits     -   Level 60 Ascension    5x Artifex&#39;s Gyreheart   15x Netherworld Pass   64,000x Credits       1x Star Rail Pass      Level 70 Ascension    7x Artifex&#39;s Gyreheart   28x Netherworld Pass   128,000x Credits     -   Total Materials    12x Artifex&#39;s Module   13x Artifex&#39;s Cogwheel   12x Artifex&#39;s Gyreheart   50x Netherworld Pass   246,400x Credits       3x Star Rail Pass      



You will also need a fair share of Credits. Because Hanya is a 4-star character, she only needs 246,400x Credits, as opposed to the regular 308,000x needed for 5-star characters. This does not consider the 580,100x required for leveling the character with Character EXP Materials. Nevertheless, the amount of Credits needed may be daunting. In order to obtain more Credits in Honkai: Star Rail, you should challenge Calyx (Golden): Bud of Treasures. Though the resources can come from various places, including events and story missions, this Calyx can provide the best and most stable income for Credits.






 Materials For Hanya’s Traces (Abilities) In Honkai: Star Rail 
          

Hanya’s Trace-leveling process in Honkai: Star Rail is much more demanding, with a bountiful amount of resources and Credits required to get all her abilities to the maximum level. As was previously mentioned, the first materials you need to farm for her Traces are Artifex’s Module, Artifex’s Cogwheel, and Artifex’s Gyreheart. These should be the easiest items to acquire for Hanya’s Traces, as they can be gathered in large amounts and farmed endlessly, as these enemies spawn naturally, and you are not required to consume Trailblaze Power.

The second set of materials for Hanya is exclusive to characters that follow the Path of the Harmony. Harmonic Tune, Ancestral Hymn, and Stellaris Symphony compose the item family that will be required throughout the entire process. These materials can be farmed in the Calyx (Crimson): Bud of Harmony in Honkai: Star Rail. This challenge is located on Jarilo-VI. As an item family, the lower quality item can be forged into the middle-quality material, while the mid-tier item can be crafted into the high-quality material. You should use the Synthesizer in order to do this and optimize your farming process.




As you reach higher levels in Hanya’s Traces and unlock more powerful abilities, she will start demanding boss materials. For this purpose, you will need to obtain Regret of Infinite Ochema, which drops from the weekly boss Phantylia in Honkai: Star Rail. Only 12 are required, but given the weekly limitation on bosses of this category, obtaining all of them may take a few weeks. If you constantly farm and exploit weekly limits, you may already have the required amount – or at least enough to reduce your farming efforts, which, in turn, allows you to use Trailblaze Power to obtain other resources, like the Harmony materials.

The table below lists all the materials needed to fully upgrade and unlock all of Hanya’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail:

 Hanya Trace Materials In Honkai: Star Rail   Artifex&#39;s Module    28x      Artifex&#39;s Cogwheel    42x      Artifex&#39;s Gyreheart    42x      Harmonic Tune    12x      Ancestral Hymn    54x      Stellaris Symphony    105x      Regret of Infinite Ochema    12x      Tracks of Destiny    5x      Credit    2,400,000x      






Farming for Hanya is pretty easy, especially considering the significant amount less she uses when compared to 5-star heroes. Nevertheless, Hanya seems like a solid support option, especially for team comps in Honkai: Star Rail that are accustomed to consuming Skill Points abundantly in battle.
