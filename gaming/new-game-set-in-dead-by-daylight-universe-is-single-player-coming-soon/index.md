## Literature Review

An all-new narrative-driven interactive horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe is a disturbing collaboration with Supermassive Games.




Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive are teaming up to produce the next big thing in narrative-driven interactive horror with their upcoming collaboration titled The Casting of Frank Stone, set in the Dead by Daylight universe. The single-player narrative horror game was officially revealed at The Game Awards 2023 on December 7, 2023, and looks to be a promising project created by two of the biggest names in horror gaming.




Set to release across multiple platforms, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, The Casting of Frank Stone is a story that takes place in the varied DbD universe, which ties into a multitude of lore for several iconic horror properties, the most recent of which was the arguably OP killer toy, Chucky. While that well-known horror title is based in PvP combat, the new title will be a standalone single-player experience.

                  The Game Awards 2023: Biggest Announcements, Trailers, &amp; New Game Reveals   At The Game Awards 2023, new trailers and first-time reveals made up a huge part of the show. Here’s every major announcement made at TGA 2023.   


 The Casting Of Frank Stone Is A New Narrative Horror Game 
         

Supermassive is an iconic horror game developer who has created a multitude of solid titles and is arguably one of the driving forces of the entire genre of interactive horror games. These titles play out more like movies than video games and rely on storytelling and solid acting. Creators of Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and most recently, the teenage camp horror story The Quarry, there is arguably no studio better to take on the task of adapting the DbD universe to a single-player narrative video game.




Set in Cedar Hills, an Oregon steel mill, The Casting Of Frank Stone will feature a young group of friends — much like other narrative-driven Supermassive titles and the survivors in DbD — as they attempt to overcome the trials of the strange happenings in the small town. Frank Stone, a disturbed killer, leaves deep-lasting wounds on the people in Cedar Hills and bends the fabric of reality itself. This horrid existence is known as The Entity&#39;s Realm and will feature iconic killers in the Dead by Daylight universe.

                  Dead by Daylight&#39;s Multiverse Is Even More Ambitious Than Fans Imagined   Dead by Daylight&#39;s horror multiverse has always been gigantic, but now its interconnectedness is finally being laid bare to fans.

The Casting Of Frank Stone is a narrative-driven horror game with decision-making elements that could mean life or death for the characters. Known for their divergent storylines, Supermassive plans to create an immersive experience that elicits a full array of emotions as it plunges people into the dark universe the DbD community has enjoyed for years. It will also contain additional lore considered canon, further extending the already complex DbD narrative.

                  25 Best Horror Games To Play Right Now   From demonic entities to sadistic killers, there&#39;s so much to choose from for horror game fans. Here are 25 of the best horror titles available.   

Every decision made in the game will have an impact, with tough decisions that sometimes feel like the lesser of two evils. These gut-wrenching moments make the narrative horror genre fun. The team of young adults must track down the mystery plaguing Cedar Hills, and the more they unravel, the weirder and more brutal it gets. Choices can result in different outcomes, lending themselves to replayability, especially for those who enjoy gore and murder. The Casting Of Frank Stone is set to release sometime in 2024, though an exact date has yet to be set.
