# Your Long Wait For Elden Ring DLC News Might Be Over Soon


## SUMMARY 



  The Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, may release sooner rather than later in 2024 based on a new DLC package added to the game&#39;s files on Steam.   The lack of trailers and updates for the DLC has created speculation and anticipation among fans, but there is no official confirmation of a release date or detailed content information.   While the presence of the new DLC package hints at a more substantial reveal, it&#39;s important to take leaks and unofficial information with a grain of salt, as the DLC&#39;s official release could still be months away.

## Literature Review

Although there&#39;s been a long wait for Elden Ring&#39;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, a new behind-the-scenes addition could mean that its drawing to a close.




Although news regarding the upcoming Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, has been scarce, a behind-the-scenes addition to the game could indicate that it&#39;ll be releasing sooner rather than later in 2024. Similar to the pre-launch cycle for the game itself, the advertising for Shadow of the Erdtree has been practically nonexistent outside its announcement, which has driven a fair amount of speculation that more concrete trailers for the DLC would appear at various gaming events near the end of 2023.




Despite being announced relatively early in 2023 via a tweet from the official Elden Ring X (formerly Twitter), no further news about the Shadow of the Erdtree was announced that year, with the Elden Ring DLC being completely absent from any events and receiving no new teasers or trailers. While some Elden Ring leaks point to a February release, there hasn&#39;t been any official confirmation of a release date, and the lack of trailers or updates means that extremely little is known about what the DLC&#39;s content will contain. One piece of evidence, though, may support an early 2024 launch.

                  Elden Ring: All Endings Explained   It can be tough to understand all six of Elden Ring&#39;s endings, but they&#39;re simpler than most players think. Here&#39;s each ending explained in detail.   


 Elden Ring DLC Update May Hint At Shadow Of The Erdtree Release 
Still No Official Updates
         




As spotted by @Ziostorm1 on X, an unidentified DLC package has been added to Elden Ring&#39;s files on Steam, viewable on the game&#39;s SteamDB DLC page - the first package of its type to be added to the game&#39;s files since its February 2022 release. Currently, there&#39;s no official confirmation that the DLC package is Shadow of the Erdtree and no currently revealed plans for a trailer or release date announcement, but the addition of a new DLC package to the game could indicate that FromSoftware is gearing up to give the game a more substantial reveal.


 

Of course, as with any leak or reveal that hasn&#39;t been officially verified and confirmed, this should be taken with a grain of salt - while it&#39;s hard to imagine what else a new DLC package for Elden Ring could be, the presence of the new package still isn&#39;t a surefire indicator that the DLC, or new announcement. In fact, even if the upload is Shadow of the Erdtree, the DLC&#39;s official release could still be months away. While it isn&#39;t certain whether the best Elden Ring characters will return for the DLC, it&#39;s still enough to get people excited for any news.




                  10 Elden Ring Mysteries Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Can Solve   Elden Ring&#39;s many mysteries are what makes the story so engaging, but some questions deserve answers, and the DLC may be the best way to get them.   

Still, taking into account the prior leaks, along with the DLC package upload, an early 2024 launch of Elden Ring&#39;s DLC is a distinct possibility - and even in the case where the DLC content isn&#39;t necessarily released within that window, it could still receive new trailers and announcements to show more of what the DLC will contain. Especially in the case that Shadow of the Erdtree&#39;s launch is planned for the coming months, more substantial updates on the Elden Ring DLC could be forthcoming relatively soon.
