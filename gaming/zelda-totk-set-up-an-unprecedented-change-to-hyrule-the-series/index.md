# Zelda TOTK Set Up An Unprecedented Change To Hyrule &amp; The Series


## SUMMARY 



  Hyrule&#39;s recent technological advancements in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could lead to a fully modernized Hyrule in future games.   A modernized Hyrule would drastically change the atmosphere of the Zelda franchise, offering new gameplay mechanics and narrative possibilities.   However, moving further away from the franchise&#39;s fantasy roots may not be for the best, as it could alienate a significant portion of the Zelda fanbase.

## Literature Review

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has set up what could become the biggest change to the entire Zelda franchise in its history.




Hyrule has experienced great changes in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and this could have an unprecedented effect on the entire franchise in the future. The Legend of Zelda series has long established traditions and motifs in its gameplay and story to ensure that all titles feel part of a continuous whole, no matter their differences. However, if recent trends continue, Hyrule could soon experience a radical change unlike any seen before.




Although Hyrule is typically depicted as a classic fantasy world, it is not unusual for The Legend of Zelda to explore diverse ideas and concepts both within this framework and occasionally branching beyond it. For example, A Link Between Worlds presents the concept of parallel universes in a way that adheres strongly to the fantasy aesthetic, despite the concept being more often associated with science fiction. More broadly, despite the many millennia which have undoubtedly passed since Hyrule’s creation, the races who call the kingdom home have seen their civilization remain remarkably stagnant, as have other settings in the Zelda world. However, this status quo may soon be thoroughly broken.



Even Spirit Tracks’ use of trains and steam power does not seem to have spread the involved technology beyond its application in the rail system.





 TOTK Could Lead To Hyrule Becoming Fully Modernized 
          




It can&#39;t be denied that Hyrule has experienced vast growth in its technology recently, beginning in Breath of the Wild. The rediscovery of ancient Sheikah technology led Purah and Robbie to pioneer several innovations of their own, perhaps the most notable result of this being Tears of the Kingdom’s Purah Pad. Like the Sheikah Slate before it, the Purah Pad is essentially a magical smart device, with several of its functions being clearly similar to real-life tablets. Similarly, Hyrule has now also found and begun to incorporate Zonai technology into everyday life. If this trend continues, then a future Zelda game could present a fully modernized Hyrule.

The many applications of Tears of the Kingdom’s Zonai Devices alone appear to present the beginning of a technological revolution for Hyrule. Link is able to build equivalents to cars and personal planes among many other contraptions, and although his unique Ultrahand ability gives him an advantage in construction, the efforts of the Yiga alone prove that it is far from necessary to make use of this technology. Similarly, Link can find a railcar which runs between Tarrey Town and the nearby construction site on the Torin Wetland. Built with Zonai devices, this railcar is held together with some form of cable rather than Ultrahand’s green glue.




Hyrule is now embracing technology in a way that it never has before. Despite the previous stagnation of their technology level, curiosity and innovation now seem to be driving forces for Hylians, and other aces are following in their lead. For example, the racetrack that is set up near Tarrey Town soon attracts the interest of Sand-seal racing champion Tali. And with the Purah Pad clearly being intended for widespread production and use in the future, it is clear that the spread of the Sheikah and Zonai’s science is not likely to slow down any time soon. As a result, Hyrule could very easily become almost unrecognizable in the future.



 Modern Technology Would Radically ChangeThe Legend Of Zelda 
          

A modernized Hyrule is now easier to envisage than ever, with Purah and Robbie undoubtedly being capable of devising an equivalent to the internet and other such staples of modern life. Whether this would be a good thing is debatable. On one hand, the possibilities, both mechanically and narratively, are certainly intriguing. Zonai Devices are proof that the Zelda franchise can accommodate advanced technology in its gameplay, whether for combat, exploration or even puzzle-solving. Further expanding in this vein would likewise undoubtedly open up many new potential game mechanics.




                  TOTK’s Biggest Contributions To The Zelda Series Won’t Be Its Gameplay   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has contributed a lot to the series, but its most influential aspect isn’t necessarily gameplay.   

In addition to the impact on the Zelda series’ gameplay, increasing the use of advanced technology throughout Hyrule would naturally have immense implications for the Zelda series’ lore and narrative. A modernistic Hyrule, drawing on the skepticism recognizable in real society, might even dismiss stories of Ganon as unrealistic legends. This would undoubtedly be to the kingdom’s detriment when the Curse of Demise begins to afflict it once more, but the uncovering of the truth behind those ancient legends would provide an interesting and unique new internal perspective on the franchise as a whole.



 Moving Away From Zelda’s Fantasy Roots May Not Be The Best 
         




On the other hand, it can be argued that a ‘modern’ Hyrule would lose quite a bit of the fantasy-style magic (both literal and otherwise) that is such an integral part of The Legend of Zelda. It seems impossible to fully separate Hyrule from its current ‘sword and sorcery’ aesthetic, with wooden houses, towering stone castles, and horse-drawn carts. In contrast, leaning harder into the concept of magical technology could change the face of Hyrule so completely that it would become near-unrecognizable. Although this would undoubtedly have its fans, such an overwhelming change in direction could also easily alienate large portions of the Zelda fanbase.

Although The Legend of Zelda franchise will continue to grow and develop with each new entry, it is less certain if the direction it seems to be moving toward would maintain its underlying appeal. Of course, any future titles could also make a clean break from the continuity set up in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, rendering Hyrule’s recent technological advances moot. In the end, only time will tell just how far this unprecedented change to the series will go.




              The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017. A rare occurrence in Zelda titles, Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel instead of loosely connected. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link will take to the skies and learn about a mysterious kingdom in the clouds.
