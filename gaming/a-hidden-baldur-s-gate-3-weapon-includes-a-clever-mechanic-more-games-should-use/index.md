## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 revives an age-old weapon mechanic that more games should borrow from. Here’s how, and why most players will never even notice it.




A pair of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 weapons have a unique twist that future games should take inspiration from. It shouldn&#39;t come as too much of a surprise: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is full of novel ideas, from its singular approach to player freedom to its well-thought-out quests. However, the last place one would expect to find such innovation is in the systems of weapons, gear, and equipment. These are borrowed straight out of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#39; Fifth Edition, and as such, don&#39;t contain many surprises. Unlike other borrowed mechanics, they&#39;re not even subject to many of the differences between Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and DnD.




But as it turns out, BG3 snuck its very own engaging weapon mechanic in there, even if most players may never find it. It&#39;s not totally new - the same concept has appeared in a lot of classic adventure games, and even featured in one of BG3&#39;s fellow Game of the Year contenders. However, the way it&#39;s implemented here is totally different.

                  One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Illithid Power Is Completely Overpowered   There are a lot of good Illithid Powers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the way that one in particular scales makes it a uniquely attractive option.   


 Two BG3 Weapons Must Be Assembled From Disparate Parts 
          

Two weapons that feature in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the Vision of the Absolute and the Masterwork Weapon, must be cobbled together from a variety of different parts scattered all throughout Act One&#39;s maps. In a way, this is a nod to a common mechanic in classic point-and-click adventure games. In those, it&#39;s exceedingly common to find broken pieces of important quest items lying about. These often can&#39;t be used on their own, and must be combined to unlock a further area, or another necessary item. However, in a game with a map as big as Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, this mechanic takes on a whole new character.




In the typical open-world RPG, crafting is a bit more of a slog. Player characters pick up tons of crafting items throughout the entire game, inflating their inventory weight past the point of utility. If they&#39;re lucky, they&#39;ll use a handful of them to make incremental upgrades to their gear, or to create huge stacks of important items they use regularly, like healing potions or weapon ammo.

This can make crafting feel like a chore: repetitive and unrewarding. Players are constantly scanning for a myriad of different types of tiny items, each of which is entirely useless on its own. But even when they are combined into useful items, the brief bonuses or slight upgrades they provide are disappointing in proportion to the effort required to obtain them.

By contrast, these two weapons in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 may take more time to craft, but the crafting itself is much simpler in its own way. These weapons effectively have just two or three parts each - players have to be lucky enough to find them, smart enough to understand the connections between them, and wise enough to pick them up before they progress too far in the story. They don&#39;t have to be on constant lookout for items, or worry about how they&#39;re going to store tons of junk.




And when they finally finish crafting the Vision of the Absolute or the Masterwork weapon, the result is intensely satisfying. It scratches the same itch as solving puzzles in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: the player&#39;s powers of intellect and observation have been tested. And once they&#39;ve succeeded, they&#39;re rewarded with one of two truly unique - and actually useful - weapons that they can use throughout the game. This makes crafting feel like a worthwhile, interesting endeavor, and the resulting weapons like cherished relics.



 How To Get BG3&#39;s Secret Crafted Weapons 
The Vision Of The Absolute And Masterwork Weapons Explained
         

Getting either the Vision of the Absolute or one of the Masterwork Weapons is a multi-stage process undertaken across various locations, although both begin early in Act One. First, for the Vision of the Absolute, the party may run into a pair of bereaved NPCs, Andrick and Brynna, near the Owlbear Cave outside the Blighted Village. They&#39;re mourning their “brother” Edowin, who was killed in a tussle with an Owlbear. There are a variety of ways to resolve the situation: convince Brynna and Andrick to avenge Edowin, send them to aid in the battle for the Goblin Village, or pick a fight with them.




What&#39;s most important for this purpose is to search Edowin&#39;s body, and collect the Shaft of a Broken Spear. Store this away for now - it&#39;ll become useful immediately after exploring the adjacent Owlbear Cave. In a similar vein, the injured, ornery Owlbear inside can be dealt with in one of two ways: the party can fight her directly, or soothe her, then return after a Long Rest. Either way, the Owlbear will have succumbed to her injuries. In a nice little bit of environmental storytelling, the party will find the missing piece: the Head of a Broken Spear.

Now, open the inventory of whichever playable character has the spear parts in hand. Open the context menu on either one, by right-clicking on PC, pressing square on PS5, or pressing X on Xbox, and select “Combine.” Then, select the other part, and the two will be joined to form the Vision of the Absolute. This is an Uncommon Versatile spear that may also be used as a throwable weapon. More importantly, it has a unique effect called Absolute Night, which can blind its target on a failed Dexterity saving throw. It can also deal up to 12 extra points of Piercing damage to creatures with multiple sets of eyes.




For the Masterwork Weapon, the party will first need to find Highcliff&#39;s Journal in the house east of the Blighted Village windmill. It&#39;s secreted away behind a barrel, in an alcove left of the fireplace. This begins the quest &#34;Finish the Masterwork Weapon,&#34; which leads them down to the building&#39;s basement - but to make their lives easier, the party should also pick up the Old Key atop a nearby crate before heading down. Downstairs, at least one party member must pass a Perception check to spy a trapped chest. Disarm it, unlock it with the key, and they&#39;ll find a blueprint.

In short, this directs them to find a piece of Sussur Bark, which the party will almost certainly pass by as they travel through the Underdark. Bring that back to the Blighted Village house, put it in the furnace, and add a common dagger, greatsword, or sickle to create a Sussur Weapon. The weapon gains a &#43;1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as a special effect that silences its target on a successful hit.






 Zelda: TOTK Uses A Similar Weapon Crafting Mechanic To BG3 
          

Another major 2023 fantasy game and fellow GOTY contender to BG3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also uses a weapon fusion system that&#39;s similar in concept, but very different in execution. The Fuse mechanic allows players to glue together almost any two kinds of parts - weapon, junk, even bodily - to create a more powerful piece of equipment. Of course, this is more widespread than in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which only has two craftable weapons (maybe three, including the Adamantine Forge items in BG3).

The sheer range of equipment players can create is staggering, and allows for some incredible feats of creativity. Players can seek out their preferred high-stat items for some of the best Fuse materials in TOTK, but that&#39;s not always a viable strategy. Since weapons or their attached parts often break mid-combat, players may be left scrambling for a replacement. This system creates delightful chaos as opposed to BG3&#39;s satisfying order.




But just as both weapon crafting mechanics have advantages, both also have drawbacks. BG3&#39;s weapon crafting system doesn&#39;t allow for as much freedom as TOTK&#39;s. TOTK&#39;s isn&#39;t as satisfying in the long run, since weapon fusion becomes second nature as a core mechanic of combat. Each is well-suited to its particular game: something so cartoonish and action-heavy as TOTK&#39;s Fuse would never work in the turn-based realism of BG3, and something so rigid and linear as BG3&#39;s crafted weapons would never work in the open-world sandbox of TOTK.

Either approach has its merits, and it’d be nice to see more games take a page out of BG3 or TOTK’s book. Crafting isn’t a major part of Baldur’s Gate 3, outside its relatively simple Alchemy system. So, when it is implemented, it tends to have a major impact. Crafting projects are drawn out, yet simple, and really make a difference once completed. The end result makes crafting seem more impactful and less like a chore. Baldur’s Gate 3 certainly didn’t invent this approach to crafting and weapon fusing, but it includes one of the best implementations of it in recent memory.
