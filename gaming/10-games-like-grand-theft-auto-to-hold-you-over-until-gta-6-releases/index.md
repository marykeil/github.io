## Literature Review

The wait for Grand Theft Auto 6 could be a while yet, but there&#39;s no shortage of alternatives to provide entertainment in the meantime.




Although a reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally impending, the game is unlikely to actually arrive for a while yet, leaving a gap to fill for anyone ready for the launch. Finding alternatives to the Grand Theft Auto experience can be difficult, as few games can boast the scope and variety of what the crime saga from Rockstar Games has to offer. Luckily, there&#39;s still a library of games that make for decent alternatives, with some being truly excellent experiences in their own right.
The best games like Grand Theft Auto offer interesting environments to explore and plenty of side content to take on, whether that comes in the form of carjacking or different activities entirely. A focus on crime is also a standard element of similar experiences, although it&#39;s not always presented from the same angle as Grand Theft Auto. The success of the series means that there are a number of poor clones on the market, but the premiere alternatives have their own inspirations and ideas.

 10  Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) 
Rockstar Games


 







Red Dead Redemption 2 might seem like an obvious recommendation as the latest entry in Rockstar&#39;s other flagship series, but it isn&#39;t the most similar to Grand Theft Auto in terms of setting. Like Grand Theft Auto, however, the story does deal with plenty of crime and commentary, and the open world features the detail-rich possibilities that are hard to find elsewhere. Red Dead Redemption 2 is also likely to be a blueprint for GTA 6 in some regards, so playing it first is an easy way to get a read on the direction of Rockstar&#39;s evolution.

 9  LEGO City Undercover (2013) 
TT Games
        

LEGO City Undercover is the family-friendly alternative to Grand Theft Auto, jumping into the shoes of the police instead of the criminals and sticking to cartoonish toy action. The core gameplay is in line with LEGO movie tie-in games, with a variety of levels featuring puzzles and challenges to overcome, but the hub world offers a fun city sandbox that feels like a reasonable GTA-lite experience. It&#39;s also available on the Nintendo Switch, potentially scratching the itch for a little on-the-go cops and robbers mayhem.





 8  Saints Row 4 (2013) 
Volition
        

Saints Row 2 might still be the best Saints Row game, at least in terms of delivering a sincere story and believable world, but Saints Row 4 stands out more as a unique alternative to Grand Theft Auto. Saints Row 3 willfully jumped the shark into an absurd experience focused on over-the-top antics and obnoxious humor, and the fourth entry dialed things up yet again for an undeniably memorable experience. A recent reboot attempted to modernize a tone that hasn&#39;t necessarily aged all that well, but it ultimately fell short of the arguable heights of Saints Row 4.





 7  Watch Dogs 2 (2016) 
Ubisoft
        

The original Watch Dogs and the third title Legion are both games that promised a little more than they ultimately delivered, leading to some negative outlooks on the series as a whole. Watch Dogs 2, however, made the most of its &#34;Grand Theft Auto with hacking&#34; premise. Current GTA 6 leaks indicate that it&#39;s going to feature more hacking than past Grand Theft Auto games, so spending some time with Watch Dogs 2 is the perfect way to get into the groove of cybercrime.
Watch Dogs 2 was followed up in 2020 by Watch Dogs: Legion, which saw somewhat mixed reviews from users. 






 6  Cyberpunk 2077 (2020) 
CD Projekt Red


 







Like GTA 6, Cyberpunk 2077 had an enormous and lengthy hype cycle leading up to its launch, which ultimately led to a lot of disappointment when it released as a buggy game that didn&#39;t innovate quite as much as many people wanted it to. After plenty of updates and the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, it&#39;s easier to focus on its good points than before. Cyberpunk 2077 offers plenty of opportunities to commit crimes and get rich in a much more futuristic environment than Grand Theft Auto, and GTA 6 probably won&#39;t be able to best its gorgeous graphics by much.

 5  Just Cause 3 (2015) 
Avalanche Studios
        

Just Cause 3 is the perfect game for those who value the mayhem of Grand Theft Auto above all else. There&#39;s no giant city to explore here, but there is plenty to blow up, and high-speed chases are thrilling thanks to satisfyingly fun driving physics. The real star of the show is the grappling hook, which gives the protagonist Rico Rodriguez an extra dose of mobility that&#39;s further assisted by a wingsuit for high-speed sightseeing.





 4  Mafia: Definitive Edition (2020) 
Hangar 13
        

The original Mafia game stands well above most of the crime games that released in the wake of Grand Theft Auto 3, no doubt partly because it had been in development long before the release of the game-changing title. The remake Mafia: Definitive Edition is arguably the best experience that the series has to offer today. The mechanics might not hold up to the sandbox freedom offered by GTA, but a compelling storyline and 1930s setting give it a uniquely compelling edge.

 3  The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run (2003) 
Radical Entertainment
        

In the early 2000s, The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run was the game to get for anyone whose parents were a little skittish about the whole Grand Theft Auto thing. This chaotic successor to The Simpsons: Road Rage ran with a sandbox open-world direction and heavier character focus that mimicked the success of GTA 3 and Vice City, and the cartoon world of Springfield makes for a vividly engaging setting. Unfortunately, it&#39;s long been left languishing without a sequel or remaster, but picking up an old console copy is well worth the hassle.

 2  Yakuza 0 (2015) 
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio


 







If Grand Theft Auto ever feels just a bit too cynical and cruel, Yakuza 0 is the perfect answer. The prequel entry in Sega&#39;s organized crime series has plenty of beatdowns, but mixed in among all the violence is a surplus of feel-good material. Joint protagonists Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima are just as likely to help out the unfortunate as they are to slam a thug&#39;s face into a wall, and the quirky flavor of the life lessons makes them especially memorable. There&#39;s no driving to be found here, but the smaller scale never feels constricting thanks to the incredible density of content.

 1  Sleeping Dogs (2012) 
United Front Games
        

There&#39;s nothing quite like Sleeping Dogs, which delves into the brutal world of the Hong Kong triads for action-adventure gameplay. Like Yakuza, this is a good title for anyone interested in brawls, although the hand-to-hand combat is more reminiscent of Batman&#39;s flurries of blows in the Arkham games. The abandoned sequel to this title is a cancelation that still ranks, but that shouldn&#39;t stop anyone from enjoying Sleeping Dogs as a perfect game to play while waiting for Grand Theft Auto 6 to release.
