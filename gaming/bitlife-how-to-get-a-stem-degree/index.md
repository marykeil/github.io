## Literature Review

Getting a STEM degree in BitLife is not as easy as players are required to attend a University and study majors like Engineering or Mathematics.





Getting a STEM degree in BitLife works very similar to real life. You will be required to be an expert in subjects like Chemistry, Physics amongst others. To get a degree in one of the fields of study, you will need to apply to a University, and once you are accepted, you will have a choice to select a subject. It is recommended to pick Engineering or Mathematics if you want to attend Space Camp in the future and become an Astronaut.

 How To Get a Degree For a STEM Major In BitLife 
          

As mentioned earlier, to get a STEM degree, you are required to pass in subjects like Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics. To get a degree, you only need to study one of the subjects at the University. However, there might be additional issues you might face when trying to get accepted at University. First of all, you have to make sure your character is 18 years old in order to be qualified to attend the University. Additionally, make sure you have cleared all the academic requirements of high school.

According to Pro Gamer Guides, to attend a University in BitLife, you must get good grades in high school as well. This will be a major factor when applying to Universities and getting accepted. Much like Universities in The Sims 4, money also plays a huge role as it will be required to pay the Universityâ€™s exorbitant tuition. You can always get started with part-time jobs during high school to save money for college. Alternatively, you can also apply for a Scholarship; however, getting one is extremely hard.






Universities also offer nonacademic activities such as Sports, Music, or Acting. If your character has skills in any of the attributes, it might help during the admission process and in getting a Scholarship.




Once you graduate from University, you will get a STEM degree in your chosen field. This will be your first step towards attending the Space Camp and becoming an astronaut. If you climb up the ranks at the Space Camp, you should be able to become an Astronaut soon enough, have a high-paying job and start a new adventure while exploring the depths of space in BitLife and even have an encounter with an Alien.
