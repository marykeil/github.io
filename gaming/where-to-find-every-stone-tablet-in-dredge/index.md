## Literature Review

A Pursuit side quest in Dredge has players try to find out where every Stone Tablet hides, as objects leading to rewards, items, and achievements.





To navigate the Devil&#39;s Spine, you first need to understand how Dredge organizes its vast ocean and island map. Every region in the game is divided into a grid, with areas identified through a specific number and letter combination. For example, finding section O11 would involve tracing the column and row of the map tied to each category until they meet at a certain point in the world.

 All Stone Tablet Locations In Dredge 
          

There are three Stone Tablets around the Devil&#39;s Spine, in locations N14, P13, and Q13 on the map. You may need to equip your ship with the best engines in Dredge to have enough fuel to reach these spots, which may be far away from different settlements. You must dredge where bubbles can be seen on the water&#39;s surface to collect each Tablet found in these areas across the ocean.

  Stone Tablet   Where to Find    N14   The bubbles showing the Tablet&#39;s location are blocked by fallen debris next to a series of partially sunken ruins.    P13   In the corner of another set of ruins, you should be able to see the spot to dredge for the Tablet near fiery red lights.    Q13   Travel to the northeast section of Charred Pontoon Island to find the area where you can dredge for the Tablet.   








You will need to bring Packed Explosives to get to at least one Stone Tablet blocked by debris, which can be bought from the Retired Whaler NPC in the Little Marrow Whaling Yards.




If you are having trouble finding any of these places, keep in mind that the P13 Tablet is directly west of the Q13 item. You may have to sell a few fish at local markets in Dredge to buy Packed Explosives that can remove debris from at least one of the ruins hiding the Tablet location in N14. None of these are too hard to notice, but you might have some trouble carrying each Tablet in your inventory since each takes up a good number of slots.



 How To Complete The Stone Tablets Pursuit In Dredge 
          

The Trader gives the Stone Tablet Pursuit quest in Little Marrow, whether you have already collected the artifacts. Like the Message in a Bottle item in Dredge, the Tablets have a hidden meaning that lets the Fisherman understand more about the events taking place in the world. Once you deliver the Tablets to the Trader, the NPC will transform the artifacts into a Fused Tablet.




The Fused Tablet can open the Ancient Lighthouse Door in section O15, which has its own set of rewards inside. Once you find every Stone Tablet in Dredge, you can earn 3,500&#43; Lumens, two Rings, two Goblets, and a Flame of the Sky to use on your continuing adventure.
