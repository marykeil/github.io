## Literature Review

To celebrate Screen Rant&#39;s 20th anniversary, the gaming team takes a look at some of the best - and worst - gaming stories of the last two decades. 




In celebration of 20 years of Screen Rant, the SR Gaming editor team has taken a look back at some of the biggest news stories and most viral gaming moments from 2003 to today. While some of these celebrate the excitement and joy of gaming - like the crowd&#39;s reaction to 2016&#39;s God of War reveal - some highlight the more serious and problematic sides of the industry. such as allegations against video game companies.
There&#39;s no doubt that gaming has changed significantly over the years, not just in terms of the technological advancements of the games and systems themselves, but also in terms of culture surrounding gaming. In the last decade alone, commonplace practices like developer crunch have been exposed in various studios, while the explosion of social media has made leaks and fan criticism more prevalent than ever. For almost every negative, there&#39;s a positive though. Here&#39;s Screen Rant&#39;s list of some of the good - and the bad - of the last 20 years of video games.
            
 
 20 Best Video Games Of The Last 20 Years 
In honor of Screen Rant&#39;s 20th anniversary, the Gaming team has selected the best 20 games of the last 20 years, with one entry per year.












 








 20  The Short Life Of Google Stadia 
2019 - 2023
        

Truthfully, from the inception of Google Stadia, critics predicted its downfall. Google has notoriously struggled with ambitious projects before: Google &#43;, Google Cardboard, Google Hangouts, to name a few - and Stadia seemed too good to be true. A cloud-based gaming service that would allow users to stream new releases to their TVs or web browsers, Stadia promised a chance to experience modern gaming at its high settings peak for those without expensive rigs or access to consoles.
In practice, however, Google Stadia never really got off the ground. While it attempted to gain market shares with Stadia exclusive titles, other companies developed web-streaming services as competitors. That, coupled with a library that didn&#39;t stack up as a reason to subscribe to the service, ultimately killed the project well before its actual demise in 2023. Despite this, Google&#39;s attempt to crack the gaming market will be remembered forever.





 19  The Battle Royale Genre Boom 
2017 - Present


 







It&#39;s hard to imagine now, but people used to play multiplayer games that didn&#39;t feature dozens of other enemies scattered across a huge map competing for resources, weaponry, and other bonuses. 2017 saw one of the biggest innovations to multiplayer gaming in history when both PUBG and Fortnite released. While DayZ laid the foundation for battle royales, PUBG is what popularized them - hurtling players into an open environment with others competing for survival. Fortnite didn&#39;t actually start out as a battle royale, but very quickly included the companion mode upon the burgeoning success and popularity of PUBG.
In 2023, we know who won that competition, but in 2017, battle royales were hot, and both games looked like they&#39;d be staples for years to come. Ultimately, competition like Warzone out of Call of Duty pushed the more realistic battle royale titles into a competitive stalemate, while Fortnite soared to the top of the genre and has never looked back, continuing to implement crossover events across pop culture to maintain its relevancy. Long live the battle royale.





 18  Genshin Impact Compared To Zelda: Breath Of The Wild 
2019
        

Prior to its release in 2020, HoYoverse&#39;s Genshin Impact was known for one thing: its alleged status as a Breath of the Wild &#34;ripoff.&#34; To be fair, the similarities are vast - both titles are open world, featuring exploration, stamina mechanics, resource gathering, cooking systems, similar action combat, and a blonde-haired protagonist. &#34;Anime Breath of the Wild&#34; was frequently used as a detractor for Genshin, which faced a lot of undeserved backlash before demonstrating its value post-launch. In 2023, Genshin Impact is one of the highest-earning live service titles and has developed an identity that&#39;s truly its own.
In 2019, however, tension boiled over between Genshin Impact and an army of uninformed Breath of the Wild defenders. During a Sony promotional event for Genshin Impact on PS4 in Shanghai, a fan was so upset by the supposed &#34;theft&#34; of Breath of the Wild&#39;s gameplay that he produced a PlayStation 4 Pro before smashing it on the ground in protest. He was then stopped by security, resulting in one of the tamest, least impactful protests in gaming history - both Sony and HoYoverse are doing pretty well, and have had a strong partnership across multiple titles.





 17  No Man’s Sky&#39;s Redemption Story 
2016 - Present


 







Now regarded as the defining example of a video game redemption story, 2016&#39;s No Man&#39;s Sky and 2023&#39;s couldn&#39;t be more different. Fans were incredibly excited for the game&#39;s release, only to find most of the promised features missing at launch. No Man&#39;s Sky and its developer, Hello Games, quickly become synonymous with disappointment and broken promises, but in the years since, the team has crafted a wonderfully deep and robust title with countless fans across the globe thanks to various overhauls, patches, and expansive updates.
The ultimate &#34;comeback-kid,&#34;No Man&#39;s Sky and its redemption arc have been a talking point for the best part of a decade now, and are often cited when it comes to more modern games that haven&#39;t met expectations at launch.





 16  Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Keanu Reeves Is Breathtaking 
2019


When Keanu Reeves took the stage at E3 2019 to reveal his role in CD Projekt Red&#39;s Cyberpunk 2077, he made headlines around the world. As one of the most highly-anticipated releases back in 2019, the news that Reeves would be lending his talents to the game in the role of Johnny Silverhand was memorable enough, but it&#39;s the &#34;breathtaking&#34; meme that spawned from this moment that lives on in infamy.
As seen in the clip above, a member of the crowd tells Reeves he&#39;s &#34;breathtaking,&#34; only for Reeves to laugh and fire back with: &#34;You&#39;re breathtaking!&#34; The wholesome moment quickly reached meme status, and is still regarded as one of the best interactions from a gaming event to this day.





 15  Pokémon Cards Become A Target For Scalpers 
2020 - Present
        

Pokémon cards have always been incredibly popular, but during the global pandemic the TCG garnered more and more interest, in part thanks to YouTubers and content creators who shifted their videos to focus on the collectible cards. As a result, the demand for Pokémon TCG product reached unprecedented heights and soon became an ever bigger popular target for scalpers than it already was. The problem grew across the world, with US stores like Target even halting the sale of Pokémon cards for a time after fights reportedly broke out in-store.
In 2023, Pokémon TCG stock is a little easier to come by, though promotional cards like the October 2023 Pokémon x Van Gogh Museum &#34;Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat&#34; card recently demonstrated that the Pokémon TCG scalping problem will never stray too far from the headlines.





 14  God of War&#39;s Big Reveal 
2016


The moment that 2018&#39;s God of War was officially revealed during E3 2016 is perhaps one of the most memorable and heartwarming stories to ever come from a game industry event. As seen in the video above, the crowd at E3 rises to their feet with excitement and shock as the entire room fills with applause. Cheers and screams begin when Kratos appears on-screen for the first time since 2010&#39;s God of War 3.
The video regularly goes viral in posts on X and TikTok to this day, and it remains one of the best examples of what a video game reveal can truly mean to the fans. While God of War&#39;s announcement didn&#39;t break the internet, it&#39;s a big gaming moment that has stood the test of time when it comes to showing what a community of fans truly looks like.





 13  Cyberpunk 2077 Pulls A No Man&#39;s Sky 
2020 - 2023


 







Cyberpunk 2077 felt too big to fail. Developer CD Projekt Red had an unparalleled history with sprawling RPGs, having created the underrated The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the appropriately lauded The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Cyberpunk was an under-explored genre at the time, and a collaboration from creator Mike Pondsmith seemed to ensure success. When the game finally launched after years in development, however, it was an unmitigated disaster - a playable, sometimes even good PC version of the game was marred by glitchy, malfunctioning console versions. Things were so bad Sony offered refunds of the game on the PlayStation store while simultaneously removing it from its storefront.
CD Projekt Red&#39;s reputation took a huge hit, and for the next few years, the developer was given the side-eye by its once faithful community. Promised updates kept getting delayed and DLC felt like a distant dream. Somehow, though, CDPR gradually brought Cyberpunk 2077 back from the brink. Slowly, the game became functional, and then actively enjoyable, on console platforms. Sweeping updates either tweaked or overhauled systems in-game to be more engaging. To cap it off, Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC was a hit, releasing in 2023 to critical acclaim and finally ushering the game back into the spotlight - this time for good reasons. Cyberpunk 2077 remains one of gaming&#39;s biggest failures and redemption stories all in one.





 12  The Death Of E3 
2023
        

E3 was once - arguably - the video game industry&#39;s biggest event. A sweeping multi-day conference and exhibition event, E3 was where major companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo announced their biggest upcoming projects. It featured celebrity appearances, surprise reveals, unnecessarily complex or overly sexualized cosplay and booth setups, and more. E3 2019 wasn&#39;t necessarily a huge success - the event accidentally doxxed many of its attendees and companies had begun to realize hosting their own streaming events was cheaper and gave them more control over their messaging. But it still existed, and people had fun with it, even if the writing was on the wall.
After the pandemic, potential attendees wondered what might happen with E3 now that it had been shelved for several years, with only the 2021 online variant as a lingering reminder of what it even looked like. As it turned out, what many expected to happen with E3 prior to 2020 finally happened afterwards. E3 2023 was announced, planned, and then promptly canceled after all three of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo decided to skip it. With the biggest names in the industry no longer requiring its services, the death of E3 finally happened, not with a bang, but an exceedingly disappointing whimper.





 11  The Last Of Us Part 2: The Most Controversial Game Of All Time? 
2020


 







The Last of Us Part 2 is the sequel to one of PlayStation&#39;s biggest-ever hits, which meant hopes were incredibly high for the Naughty Dog sequel before its 2020 release. Unfortunately for the developers, the game&#39;s story leaked ahead of schedule, revealing a plot that many fans found highly controversial due to the death of a certain protagonist. Responding to the leaks, many threatened to boycott the game, and the problem soon spiraled out of control.
Unsubstantiated rumors began to make the rounds about the new character Abby, while the game&#39;s inclusion of LGBTQIA&#43; themes also caused tension among players. Reviews became a hot topic when it was claimed that reviewers weren&#39;t allowed to discuss certain story beats or moments, which many felt led to biased scores. Despite this, TLOU 2 went onto win countless awards - including The Game Awards 2020 Game of the Year. In 2023, the game has mostly recovered from its initial negative reception, though its launch remains infamous. Abby is still considered a video game villain to this day for her inclusion in the story.





 10  Nintendo eShop  s 
2023
        

In one of the saddest gaming stories of 2023, Nintendo announced it would be closing the eShop on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U consoles. While the Switch&#39;s digital storefront remains alive and well, fans of previous generations can no longer make digital purchases on older generations of consoles.
This was a particular blow for preservation and approachability in gaming, as many of the games for these consoles can get very expensive in physical form. Being able to purchase them digitally meant they could still be playable for the masses. The closing of the Wii U eShop was particularly sad for Zelda fans, as the console had the best access to the biggest range of Zelda titles thanks to the storefront.





 9  Pokémon GO Brings Everyone Together 
2016


 







Summer 2016 is a high point in the video game landscape thanks to the release of Pokémon GO, which quickly became a global sensation. The dream of becoming a real Trainer had never been so close, and with the app being free-to-play and requiring only a mobile phone, the point of entry was approachable for an incredible number of players. According to Business Of Apps, &#34;well over 250 million people per month&#34; were playing Pokémon GO at the game&#39;s peak in 2016, truly becoming a cultural phenomenon.
While numbers have since dwindled, that one summer is fondly remembered by many. It became near-impossible to leave the house without seeing someone catching their favorite Pokémon in the wild, making this a true shared experience for fans. Developer Niantic likely won&#39;t see these types of player numbers again, but this release marked a one-in-a-million game launch that won&#39;t be forgotten anytime soon.





 8  PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X Become Hot Commodities 
2020 - 2022
        

The current console generation got off to a rocky start. Production chain issues and the general disarray of the earliest parts of the COVID-19 pandemic saw would-be PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners unable to acquire their consoles - not because of prohibitive costs, but simply because they wouldn&#39;t stay in stock. The biggest issue with current-gen console supply was scalpers, however. People quickly realized there were entire teams of console resellers hovering around retailer websites, ready to pillage restocks before flipping the consoles for an absurdly high price.
While some retailers managed to reduce their scalper issue through anti-bot implementation, the problem essentially existed until it resolved itself. Eventually, supply chain issues weren&#39;t as pronounced and more consoles became available for purchase, making it easier for real users and tanking the profitability for scalpers.





 7  Kojima &amp; Konami Split 
2015
        

Hideo Kojima and Konami were inextricable from each other for over a decade - Metal Gear was both a fan-favorite series and a critical success, and its unique narrative and character designs made sure players knew it was a Kojima creation. In 2015, however, news broke that Kojima would be leaving Konami after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Even with the cancelation of the Kojima-led Silent Hill reboot, Silent Hills, which garnered much excitement before its demo - P.T - was taken offline, it was unthinkable at the time. Kojima was one of the most recognizable developers in the world, and Metal Gear had been one of Konami&#39;s most consistent performers.
That&#39;s why, even with those rumors, the departure of Kojima - which still doesn&#39;t have a confirmed timeline - shocked the industry. It wasn&#39;t just him leaving, though. It was also the way Konami was allegedly treating him. Konami removed his name from Metal Gear marketing material, reportedly barred the developer from accepting an award he won at The Game Awards 2015, and seemingly obscured his status with the company during the process. Finally, Kojima officially announced that Kojima Productions was now an independent studio partnered with Sony on December 16, 2015. That split is what led to Death Stranding, however, and more freedom for Kojima to pursue creative alternatives to mainstream gaming.





 6  Console Announcements 
2005 - 2019


 







Anytime a new console gets announced it&#39;s sure to become a landmark event for the video game industry, and the last 20 years have seen quite a few mainline console releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo. From the aesthetic style to the horsepower, each new console generation introduces endless leaps forward for gaming, allowing the games themselves to grow and expand.
  Console   Release Date    Xbox 360   November 22, 2005    PlayStation 3   November 11, 2006    Nintendo Wii   November 19, 2006    Wii U   November 18, 2012    PlayStation 4   November 15, 2013    Xbox One   November 22, 2013    Nintendo Switch   March 3, 2017    Xbox Series X/S   November 10, 2020    PlayStation 5   November 12, 2020    Steam Deck   February 25, 2022    
As well as the usual suspects from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, Valve released its first console the Steam Deck in 2022 marking another huge shift for gaming. Taking PC titles on the go revolutionized how players can consume games. Similarly, 2007&#39;s Nintendo Switch also changed the landscape with its hybrid docked-or-handheld design. What the future holds for the next generation remains to be seen, but the next round of consoles is sure to be just as industry-shaking as every previous release.





 5  Activision Blizzard Allegations 
2021 - Present
        

Not all of the biggest gaming stories are fun or even positive - Activision Blizzard&#39;s public shaming certainly falls into that category. On July 20, 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, alleging sexual harassment in the workplace, employee discrimination, and instances of retaliation. It was a landmark case because of how prevalent it appeared to be based on reports - high-level employees were outed as guilty, being removed from the company, and a troubling culture of inequality was revealed.
Activision Blizzard paid out two separate lawsuits - $35 million for not having proper reporting structures in place, and another $18 million for its suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The company&#39;s misconduct also paved the way for other employees at different employers in the video game industry to speak up about their own experiences, and helped pull back the curtain on an industry culture that desperately needed change.





 4  GTA 6 Revealed By Leaks 
2022
        

GTA 6 is destined to reshape the gaming industry when it finally releases, so it makes sense that Rockstar had been keeping quiet on the upcoming game until it was really ready to be revealed. Announcing and revealing one of the most hotly-anticipated - and likely most lucrative - titles of all time is not just a huge undertaking for the developers, but also for the fans who&#39;ve waited so patiently for news. Unfortunately for everyone involved, GTA 6 was revealed to the world through a series of leaks after Rockstar was hacked.
As the very early development footage flooded the internet, fans were quick to criticize the visuals and style - even though everything revealed was clearly very early work from the game&#39;s production. The leak forced Rockstar to confirm the video and images came from the next GTA game - likely an announcement that was very different to the team&#39;s original reveal plan. GTA 6 is getting its first trailer in December 2023, where hopefully the leak and early dev footage will be forgotten.





 3  GTA: San Andreas&#39; Hot Coffee Lands The Game In Hot Water 
2004
        

Perhaps one of - if not the - most famous video game controversies came early into the 2000s. The &#34;Hot Coffee&#34; mod scandal emerged out of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&#39; release. Rockstar&#39;s latest was a sweeping success and pushed its series forward with a number of interesting gameplay systems, but news broke that users could access a hidden mini-game, button prompts and all, that involved explicit sex that was controlled by the player. There had never been anything like it in such a mainstream game. The name &#34;Hot Coffee&#34; came from the way CJ&#39;s girlfriend invited the player into the sex mini-game, by inviting them in for coffee.
Rockstar initially stated the mini-game was a player-created mod that was added after the game&#39;s release, but later evidence proved that &#34;Hot Coffee&#34; had been coded into the game prior to its launch. The controversy created more systems meant to monitor the content in video games and even awarded San Andreas an &#34;Adults Only&#34; rating. While Rockstar released a &#34;clean&#34; version later that re-earned a &#34;Mature&#34; rating, it would be a very long time before the public forgot about &#34;Hot Coffee.&#34;





 2  The Death of Satoru Iwata 
2015


The death of Satoru Iwata will forever be remembered as one of the biggest losses in the gaming world. The fourth president and CEO of Nintendo from 2002 to his death in 2015, Iwata is one of the creative geniuses behind some of Nintendo&#39;s most innovative releases, being the driving force behind consoles like the Nintendo 3DS and the Nintendo Wii.
Iwata&#39;s passing at the age of 55 left a big hole in the industry, especially for those at Nintendo. Iwata&#39;s passion for technology and his drive in the workplace still live on though. The 2021 book from Iwata, titled Ask Iwata: Words of Wisdom from Satoru Iwata, Nintendo&#39;s Legendary CEO, offers a fascinating look at the businessman&#39;s work ethos and experiences with one of the most important gaming companies in the world.





 1  Microsoft Buys Activision Blizzard &amp; Bethesda 
2021 - 2023
        

Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda for over $7 billion in 2021 heralded the beginning of a new era in games. Potential console exclusives from the developer, a juggernaut in the eyes of many, rocketed estimation of Xbox&#39;s potential as a brand in the future. It also felt like the biggest merger possible at the time - until Microsoft one-upped itself by buying Activision Blizzard for just shy of $69 billion in 2023.
The former acquisition meant a powerful in-house studio that could begin churning out some interesting exclusives down the pipeline, but the latter represented something even bigger: a potential monopoly on the video game industry. Trade regulation in both the United States and United Kingdom tried blocking the deal, but a victory over the former in federal court and a restructuring that satisfied the latter meant the deal went through. Time will tell exactly how these acquisitions affect the video game business, but they&#39;re two of the most significant in its history, and both occurring within a span of 3 years for the same company is unprecedented.
