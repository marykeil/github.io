## Literature Review

To resurrect Gale in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players can follow a complicated set of instructions to make a Scroll of Revivify, or opt for simpler solutions





Of all the companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, Gale is perhaps the most prone to being downed or even killed outright. Since he has a small health pool, he can die fairly quickly if he takes massive damage from enemies. However, resurrecting him is worth it, as he has one of the most powerful spells in the game. You can prevent his death by keeping him far away from enemies, but that isn&#39;t always possible.




  


 How To Revive Gale 
          

If Gale dies, the party will be treated to a cutscene where the projection of the newly deceased Wizard offers instructions for using the Scroll of True Resurrection. Unfortunately, there are a lot of steps, and the projection rushes through them.

It’s a complex process, perhaps making fun of how Wizards in Baldur’s Gate 3 can sometimes overcomplicate things to a ridiculous degree. Here’s how to safely resurrect Gale:

  Grab Gale’s Pouch by looting it from his inventory. Be careful, as his body appears to give off a strange aura that deals periodic Necrotic damage to anyone in range.   Unthread the purple seam counterclockwise.   Pick up the letter. Gale will tell you to play a series of notes in the right order, but we’ve listed them here.   Pick up the flute and position your fingers on the flute, ready to play individual notes.   Play the following notes: D, E, A, D.   A mephit will appear. Answer its question with K’ha’ssji’trach’ash.   Hand the letter to the mephit.  




This transforms the letter into a Scroll of Revivify, which you can use to resurrect Gale. After speaking with him, he will thank you for resurrecting him.

If this occurs early in the game, there’s also the option to ask him for more information. This opens up Gale&#39;s personal quest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and you can choose whether to help Gale with his requests. Like most party members, his personal quest stretches all the way from Act One to Act Three.



 Other Methods For Resurrecting Gale 
          

There are other ways to resurrect Gale that don&#39;t involve going through his complex security protocol. The easiest way is to recruit Baldur’s Gate 3’s Withers, as they have the ability to resurrect any dead companion for a small fee. You can also find other Scrolls of Revivify that don&#39;t have Gale&#39;s security and are located in Sword Coast. 




Finally, you can also opt to replay battles. Don&#39;t shy away from save scumming in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 as it may just allow you to beat the odds and stop Gale from dying in the first place.
