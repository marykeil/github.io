## Literature Review

Redemption Codes are an easy way to gain a small amount of Stellar Jade monthly in Honkai: Star Rail. Here is every active code for January 2024.





While a single redemption code may only be 50 or 60 Stellar Jade, every bit of currency helps when pulling for a desired character, such as Ruan Mei in Honkai: Star Rail. You only need 160 for one Warp and a few Redemption Codes each month. You can store Stellar Jade quickly with events, daily activities, and Trailblaze Missions. Trailblazers can pull for the 5-star Ruan Mei of the Harmony Path, who the 5-star Dr. Ratio of The Hunt Path will follow up. This will happen in the second phase of 1.6 and also feature a return of Kafka in the limited Warp Banner.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Xueyi Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Xueyi is a new 4-Star Destruction character in Honkai: Star Rail whose kit revolves around reducing Toughness and building a follow-up attack.

 How To Redeem Codes 
          

Redeem Codes On PS5 and PC (In-Game)
Players will need to enter the Redemption Codes to get the rewards mentioned below. This can be done in-game on PC and PS5, or by heading to the official Honkai: Star Rail website.




  When in-game, open the menu and select the ellipsis button on the top right of the screen. This is located next to their name and gives two options.   Select &#34;Redemption Code&#34; and either type or paste a Promo Code into the provided box.   Select confirm, and the rewards should be instantly sent to the Trailblazer&#39;s in-game mail.   Note: Phone users cannot use this method and must follow a different process (below)  

Redeem Codes On Mobile (Website)
Mobile players can proceed to the Honkai: Star Rail redemption page provided by HoYoverse. This will require that you log into your account, select the server from the drop-down menu, type the in-game name of the Trailblazer, and enter the Code. The rewards should be in the mail upon login, given the Redemption Code has not expired.

New codes are released each month and are easy to redeem. The small rewards add up and can be the difference in obtaining the latest character. Trailblazers should also take advantage of this time to claim Dr. Ratio for free before Honkai: Star Rail&#39;s v2.1 patch.
