## Literature Review

The Synchro Machine is a device you can unlock in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that lets you turn into your favorite Pokémon.





The Synchro Machine allows you to take control of a Pokémon&#39;s body to explore the open world. This can be done with any creature you have on your team and even includes new additions like the Gen 2 starters in Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk. This ability also extends to Union Circles or the online multiplayer spaces created with friends.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 3 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   Starter Pokémon have arrived with the Indigo Disk DLC, including the Treeko, Torchic, and Mudkip from the Gen 3 Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald games.   


 How To Get &amp; Use The Synchro Machine in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk 
          

You get the Synchro Machine by completing a tutorial with a woman at the top of the Central Plaza building in the Terarium. The NPC you will want to meet is near the Battle Arena and rests next to one of the healing stations on the highest floor. Talking to her reveals the purpose behind the Synchro Machine as she teaches your character how to use it in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.

The first step to learning how the Synchro Machine works is to throw one of your Pokémon into the wild and then take control of it. The woman teaching you will first ask you to walk toward a tree and give you a chance to learn the basic movement controls of a synchronized Pokémon. Every pocket monster in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet has their own walk speed and animations based on how they act in the wild.




Your next task will be to fight in three battles with wild Pokémon you encounter while within a synchronized body. Fights in this state are auto-battles, meaning you can&#39;t choose to catch any exclusive Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk in this state. Once you defeat all three opponents, the teacher awards you with the Synchro Machine at the end of the tutorial.



Once you complete the tutorial, the Synchro Machine is always found in the Key Items section of your Bag&#39;s Pocket.




After you unlock the Synchro Machine in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, you can activate it again by holding the L and R buttons over the Pokémon you want to control from your team anytime.
