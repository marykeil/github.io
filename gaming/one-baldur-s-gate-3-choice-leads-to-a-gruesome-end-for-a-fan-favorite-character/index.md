## Literature Review

Death can come when it&#39;s least expected in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and one passive decision can lead to a major character meeting their end â€” and worse.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 takes place in a troubled world, and there&#39;s no shortage of dark implications and grim fates that the game can conjure up. The triggers for some are particularly obvious, as making a choice that sacrifices innocent lives or urging a companion to turn their back on redemption are unlikely to proceed without consequences. In other cases, though, minor instances of neglect or basic decisions about what company to keep can end up having unforeseen ramifications that may not even be discovered without a bit of investigation.




The various Origin characters that can be chosen as protagonists or join the adventuring party add some memorable personality to any campaign in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but they also all come with their fair share of baggage. From Wyll&#39;s pact with a cambion to Shadowheart&#39;s allegiance to a dark god, they&#39;ve all meddled willingly or unwillingly with forces too powerful and wicked to be toyed with lightly. One particularly tragic backstory belongs to Astarion, who has a tale involving manipulation and servitude under a cruel vampire that helps explain the depths of his bitterness and enduring trauma.

  


 Astarion Becomes A Zombie If He Dies In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          




Outside of the punishing challenge of Honour Mode, it can be easy to treat death lightly in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as Revivify is often close at hand in the form of a convenient scroll or cleric spell. There are ways for characters to irrevocably die, however, mostly due to specifically choosing to kill them in narrative moments or simply abandoning them to dangerous circumstances. In Astarion&#39;s case, one major way to make sure he can&#39;t return is to employ the classic vampire-killing method of a stake to the heart, but it turns out that leaving him behind when initially forming the party also has deadly consequences for the vampire spawn.

Astarion&#39;s former master in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a vampire named Cazador, who has grand ambitions to ascend to greater power using his spawn as stepping stones. He consequently desperately wants Astarion to return to the fold as a necessary part of the ceremony, while Astarion will stop at nothing to avoid falling back into his clutches. Cazador doesn&#39;t seem to be too particular about whether Astarion is alive or (un)dead, as leaving him on the beach or killing him will result in a Zombie Astarion appearing as fodder for Cazador&#39;s ascension.






 Why Cazador&#39;s Fate For Astarion Is Cruel In BG3 
          

Although not everyone takes an immediate liking to Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 - for all of his witty charm, he&#39;s not exactly a paragon of virtue himself - being turned into a zombie for use in his abuser&#39;s ritual is an exceptionally grim fate. Finding and beating Cazador does alleviate the tragedy a little bit, as Astarion&#39;s body won&#39;t end up being used for the purpose that he would least like. Even so, it&#39;s sad to know that he never gets much of a chance for redemption on his own if the party doesn&#39;t take him on board.

It&#39;s also one of many factors showing just how needlessly cruel and vindictive Cazador is, as Astarion in particular isn&#39;t completely necessary to pull off the ritual. Finding another spawn to be the perfect replacement might not be ideal, but he could ultimately substitute his one lost follower in the role of the seventh victim. He clearly hates the idea of Astarion having broken out from under his thumb, however, and dragging his corpse back for the ritual seems to be just as much about having the upper hand over the prodigal spawn as it is about the practical demands of his ascension.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Pros &amp; Cons Of Romancing Astarion In BG3   Forming a romance with Astarion in BG3 might result in one of the deepest relationships in the entire game but may require hard decisions.   

Beyond the necessity of having spawn on hand, the rules of the ritual aren&#39;t necessarily crystal clear, although interesting bits can be gleaned from books, NPCs, and more. It&#39;s clearly an exchange of souls first and foremost, but the ability to swap out sacrifices or use a zombie make the mechanics seem a little fast and loose. What is definitive is that the principal spawn participating in the ritual have been manipulated and lied to, and the victims that they brought to Cazador over the years add somewhere around a thousand more souls to the sacrifice.



 There&#39;s No Happy Story For Astarion In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
         




Anyone who doesn&#39;t want to see Astarion dead should obviously take the basic steps to avoid this fate, but the tragedy of his past with Cazador plays out in horrific ways regardless of what choices are made. Upon venturing into the depths of Cazador&#39;s palace, Astarion finds out that the poor souls he took to Cazador to feed on were made into spawn and imprisoned rather than fed on and killed outright. Although he had clearly become as comfortable as he could be with the thought of leading them to their death, realizing that he had doomed them to a fate worse than his own comes as a major shock.

                  Was Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Really The Best Game Of 2023? Retrospective   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is an obvious choice for the year&#39;s best game, but declaring a single winner of such a prestigious title is rarely a simple affair.   

The two obvious paths from this point both have dark implications of their own - either sacrifice the victims in a ritual for Astarion&#39;s own ascension or set dangerous vampire spawn loose in Baldur&#39;s Gate. It&#39;s also possible to conduct all the business with Cazador while leaving Astarion behind in camp, but this robs him of his much-needed confrontation with his abuser, so it likewise bodes poorly for his overall mental health. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t heartless, and it provides ways to help Astarion find some healing and curb his worst tendencies, but there&#39;s no perfect good ending for Astarion&#39;s story arc to completely escape the lingering shadows of his past.






Anyone trying to romance Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 should consider taking him to the Cazador fight, as he won&#39;t forgive being left behind lightly.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is full of choices in shades of gray, and Astarion&#39;s story is a great example of that complexity. Astarion is both a villain and a victim in some regards, and trying to navigate his thorny past in hopes of a better future raises moral dilemmas without easy answers. In any scenario, however, letting Cazador use him to ascend is far from the best choice, so it&#39;s best to keep an eye on Astarion throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to prevent a terrible tragedy.
