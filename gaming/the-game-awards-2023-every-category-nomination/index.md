## Literature Review

The Game Awards is one of the biggest annual events for the video game industry, and the nominees for all 31 categories have been announced.




The nominees for every category in The Game Awards 2023 have been revealed. There will be 31 total awards given, and the nominations have narrowed each category down to five or six potential recipients. The Game Awards is perhaps the video game industry&#39;s most lucrative honors ceremony, with over 100 million viewers tuning in for the livestream in 2022. Although the show is highly anticipated for the game reveals and trailers it promises to bring each year, its prizes are ultimately the reason for the occasion.




The coveted Game of the Year award is shaping up to be an especially tight competition in 2023, with only six finalists emerging out of the deluge of high-quality releases since last year&#39;s TGA. Whichever is selected as the year&#39;s best game will follow GOTY 2022 winner Elden Ring, which triumphed over God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, Stray, A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3. The Game Awards 2023 will air at 7:30pm ET/4:30pm PT on December 7, 2023, and will be livestreamed on numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitch.
