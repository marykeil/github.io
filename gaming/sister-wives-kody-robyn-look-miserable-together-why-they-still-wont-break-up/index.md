# Sister Wives Kody &amp; Robyn Look Miserable Together (Why They Still Wont Break Up)


## SUMMARY 



  Kody and Robyn stay together despite their unhappiness to avoid being seen as failures and a laughingstock.   They fear loneliness and being without a partner, as they have never been alone in the last ten years.   Robyn&#39;s traditional beliefs and financial dependence on Kody prevent her from wanting to divorce him as well.

## Literature Review

Sister Wives stars Kody and Robyn Brown look unhappy when they&#39;re around each other; however, they will stick it out instead of calling it quits.




Kody Brown and Robyn Brown from Sister Wives don’t seem too happy in their new monogamous relationship, but they will continue to stay together regardless. The couple were once very content in their plural marriage. They lived with Kody’s first three wives, Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown, and had a stable family that included 18 children. Unfortunately, circumstances changed when Kody stopped distributing his time equally among his wives. He only put effort into his relationship with Robyn, which made Meri, Janelle, and Christine jealous. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 only worsened the situation.




In 2021, Christine decided to pick up her bags and step away from polygamy for good. She began dating again and found her soulmate, David Woolley. Likewise, Janelle and Meri Brown also reevaluated their marital situation in 2022. They followed in Christine’s footsteps and ended their relationship with Kody. Sister Wives season 18 showed the complete implosion of the Brown family as everyone quit polygamy. The circumstances made Kody angry as he embraced monogamy with Robyn. The Brown family patriarch never wanted his family to break apart but had to accept his defeat.

 Kody &amp; Robyn Don’t Want To Be The Laughing Stock 
         




Kody and Robyn have been in a miserable situation since the exit of Meri, Christine, and Janelle Brown. Despite that, they are together, hoping to continue their new monogamous relationship. Kody and Robyn would likely never break up because they wouldn’t want to look like failures. Kody is too proud and cares about his public image. Similarly, Robyn wants to portray herself as the victim and a nice person who never does anything wrong. If the couple gives up on their marriage due to monogamy or other stresses, they’ll become a laughingstock to everyone.

Kody and Robyn have been through a barrage of embarrassing moments in the last few years. When Christine left them, she exposed them on reality TV in the kindest way possible. Similarly, Janelle and Meri didn’t hold back while revealing family secrets that made polygamy look like a scam. Kody and Robyn have also shared their feelings in front of the cameras. They’ve shown themselves superior to other wives who had left them. Kody and Robyn will look like the biggest hypocrites if they break up; nobody would ever take them seriously.






 Kody &amp; Robyn Are Afraid Of Being Lonely 
         

Another reason Kody and Robyn would never split is because they weren’t ready for monogamy. Before the demise of their plural marriage, the couple had lived in the most stable circumstances for years. They had their Sister Wives and over a dozen kids to spend time with. Kody’s friendship with Janelle was exceptional, and his affection for Christine seemed real. Similarly, Robyn’s sisterly love for Meri was undeniable, as she spent many meaningful moments with her. The two had much more to look forward to every year, like reunions and family gatherings.

Sadly, everything has changed since as Kody and Robyn have fallen into a monogamous relationship. They don’t have anyone else to make them feel whole. If the two ever break up, they risk being single for the rest of their lives. Kody and Robyn have never been alone or away from each other in the last ten years. It will be difficult for them to navigate their lives without a significant other. Kody would probably lose himself without a partner, and Robyn may become unhappy without a husband to lead her.






 Robyn Is Too Traditional To Divorce Kody 
          

Robyn and Kody may have problems in the present, but they share a mutual bond and responsibilities. Robyn understands that her religion calls for her to aid and support Kody. She knows her wifely duty is to be by her husband’s side and try to stop him from dismantling himself under stress. Similarly, Kody has the responsibility of being the provider for the family. He knows he only has one wife left and understands she’s very traditional. Since both Kody and Robyn are religious, they wouldn’t want to break up.



 Robyn Isn’t Financially Independent 
          




Kody is financially responsible for Robyn. A few years ago, the Sister Wives cast started My Sisterwife’s  t, an online clothing and jewelry boutique, which became somewhat of a success initially. Unfortunately, the business didn’t blow up as much as it should’ve. Meri, Janelle, and Christine also got busy in their independent lives, leaving Robyn in charge. As of 2024, My Sisterwife’s  t is no longer active, and Robyn has no separate career of her own. Her only duty is to be Kody’s wife; she needs him to support her financially.



 Kody Is Too Assertive To Accept Defeat 
         

Kody’s assertive personality is also why he won’t divorce Robyn. Kody is a patriarch who always tries to rule over his family. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, he made rules for each one of his family members and enforced his views on them. He controlled Robyn and her kids, pushed Janelle to kick their sons out of their home, and showed the same dominance over his other wives. The Sister Wives star even made himself look like a victim and didn’t let anyone change his mind. Kody is very forceful and only does what he wants to. He doesn’t let others control him or affect him.






During his recent breakups with Meri, Christine, and Janelle, Kody made it seem like he never loved them either way.




Kody even stated that he only ever cared for Robyn. It appears Kody doesn’t want to face the truth and will do whatever it takes not to accept defeat. If the Sister Wives cast member breaks up with Robyn, it would make it seem like he is a quitter, which he doesn’t want to be.
