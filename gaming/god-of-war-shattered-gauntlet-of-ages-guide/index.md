## Literature Review

The Shattered Gauntlet of Ages is an upgradeable Talisman in God of War that will grow in power every time Kratos imbues it with a new enchantment.





The in-game description of the Shattered Gauntlet says that &#34;fragments of its former strength lie scattered throughout the realms.&#34; While you start the missions tied to this artifact in Midgard, you have to complete various favors that may take place in other locations. You need to have finished the &#34;Fafnir&#39;s Hoard&#34; quest before you can even think about finding the right enchantments in God of War.




                  How to Get Kratos&#39; Infinity Gauntlet in God of War   Here&#39;s how to get God of War&#39;s Shattered Gauntlet of Ages, the in-game equivalent to Thanos&#39; Infinity Gauntlet from Avengers: Infinity War.   


 Where To Get The Shattered Gauntlet of Ages 
          

Kratos can find the Shattered Gauntlet of Ages by following the &#34;Family Business&#34; side quest from Sindri, where they must search the Northri Stronghold for a whetstone. Speaking to Sindri during the main story, but only after you lower him into the water for the second time, will set you on the right path. This will take you to a boat where you must defeat a boss to obtain the Gauntlet. 



The greatsword-wielding boss in God of War at the end of the &#34;Family Business&#34; Favor is a variant of a Traveler enemy and summons several allies you have to defeat at the same time.







As you can see in a video by YouTube creator MrRedRivers, the Shattered Gauntlet is received once you finish the last fight within the Favor. The artifact has sockets where you can use enchantments to upgrade the item&#39;s skills beyond the lackluster traits it started with. Unfortunately, the base Gauntlet is fairly weak despite its unique ability as an Epic Talisman Kratos can wield.


 

Initially, the Shattered Gauntlet creates a bubble that knocks down enemies in God of War that are near Kratos. This creative mechanic may not deal much damage or push back foes very far away from you during a fight. The key to this rare item is the base skill and the six upgrades locked behind different quests that Kratos and Atreus can pursue at different points in the game. 






 Shattered Gauntlet of Ages Enchantments 
          

All six enchantments for the Shattered Gauntlet of Ages are tied to certain quests in every realm available in God of War, but some are easily missed if you don&#39;t know where to look. For example, one piece of magic is within a hidden chamber that Kratos could easily walk past after you crash in Helheim. Return to the dwarves Sindri and Brok to apply upgrades to the Gauntlet as you get them.

Remember that you need special materials called Dragon Tears to modify the Gauntlet with Brok and Sindri with the enchantments you find. Freeing the imprisoned dragons, Veithurgard, Konunsgard, and the Council of Valkyries will all provide Dragon Tears. Looting the dragon ridden by the Baldur in God of War after the final fight will also grant Kratos a Tear to use.






If you are still looking for a dragon&#39;s location to collect a Dragon Tear or two, feel free to watch this helpful video by YouTube creator Mista FiOth that shows the location of every Tear in the game. 

 
 




Below are the six enchantments the Shattered Gauntlet of Ages in God of War uses, as well as where to find them on your journey:

  Shattered Gauntlet of Ages Enchantment   Enchantment Unlock Requirements    Andavari&#39;s Soul   Complete Brok&#39;s Favor, &#34;Deus Ex Malachite.&#34;    Ivaldi&#39;s Corrupted Mind   Defeat Valkyrie Olrun in Alfheim.    Asgard&#39;s Shard of Existence   Defeat Valkyrie Rota in Helheim.    Muspelheim&#39;s Eye of Power   Purchase this item at the Muspelheim shop.    Njörd&#39;s Temporal Stone   Defeat the Queen of the Valkyries.    Eye of the Outer Realm   Located inside the easily missed hidden chamber of Odin after crashing in Helheim.   



While you don&#39;t need to find all the enchantments for the Shattered Gauntlet, it becomes one of the most powerful tools in Kratos&#39; arsenal if you find and infuse every piece. Only three are really needed for it to rival the strongest items in God of War. The power-ups resemble the Infinity Gauntlet wielded by Thanos in the Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame movies seen in the MCU. 






 God Of War&#39;s Infinity Gauntlet Explained 
          

As you may expect by now, the Shattered Gauntlet is basically a huge Easter Egg referencing Thanos&#39; Infinity Gauntlet from Marvel Comics and various movies. The enchantments have powers similar to individual Infinity Stones, which already had unique abilities that heroes or villains could use. Kratos&#39; Gauntlet may not be able to wipe out half the life in the universe, but it can pull off some interesting feats.

You only need three of the &#34;Infinity Stone&#34; enchantments to fully upgrade the Shattered Gauntlet, but you may want to know what each Gem you collect represents. The comparisons from the God of War items include:

  God of War Gems   Infinity Stone Equivalent    Andavari&#39;s Soul   The Soul Stone    Ivaldi&#39;s Corrupted Mind   The Mind Stone    Asgard&#39;s Shard of Existence   The Reality Stone    Muspelheim&#39;s Eye of Power   The Power Stone    Njörd&#39;s Temporal Stone   The Time Stone    Eye of the Outer Realm   The Space Stone   






According to YouTube creator GameBreakerGod, the true power of the Shattered Gauntlet comes from its ability to slow down time and fire homing projectiles toward any enemies you can see. These blasts that track hostile targets deal an extraordinary amount of damage and destroy weaker foes instantly. Simply press L1 &#43; Circle to activate its effect before waiting for it to recover during a fairly long cooldown.


 

This item likely won&#39;t be completed until you reach the endgame, but the final challenges and bosses are made easier when you fully upgrade this artifact. The Shattered Gauntlet of Ages is likely one of the coolest items in God of War and rewards anyone who takes the time to assemble this devastating weapon.
