 Arlo&#39;s Team For January 2024 In Pokémon GO 
          

Arlo has made no changes to his team since December 2023 with the same Pokémon at his disposal in Pokémon GO. The Leader will always start off the battle with Generation 1, Grass- and Poison-type Bellsprout. His second Pokémon will be one out of three at random of Psychic-type Alakazam, Ghost-type Mismagius, or Water- and Dark-type Sharpedo.

He will again select one of three Pokémon for his final option, but all provide a challenge. It will be either Normal-type Snorlax, Bug- and Steel-type Scizor or Electric- and Steel-type Magnezone.

 Best Pokémon GO Counters For Arlo In January 2024 
          

With Arlo leading with Bellsprout every time, Trainers should start with a strong Fire-type Pokémon which can easily defeat it. 






Charizard or Entei are two of the strongest Fire- types in Pokémon GO.




Against Arlo, it is also important to include a strong Fighting-type, such as Machamp or Lucario in case he selects Snorlax. Snorlax has a large amount of HP, which only a Fighting-type is super-effective against. The above Fighting- types are also super-effective against both Magnezone and Sharpedo.

Dark- and Rock-type Tyranitar is a great final option to use against Arlo in January 2024. It is super-effective against Alakazam and is strong enough to overpower many of Arlo&#39;s other Pokémon. Arlo&#39;s line-up in January 2024 can cause Trainers problems, but he can be defeated using the right counters in Pokémon GO.
