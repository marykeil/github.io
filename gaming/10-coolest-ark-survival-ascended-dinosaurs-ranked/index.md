## Literature Review

There are so many dinos to choose from in Ark: Survival Ascended that figuring out which ones to tame can actually be pretty difficult. 




With over a hundred different creatures inside of the expansive world of Ark: Survival Ascended, narrowing down the coolest or best dinos is actually a pretty difficult task. After all, with all the diversity on The Island, it&#39;s more than possible that newer players haven&#39;t even scratched the surface of the awesome creatures roaming the lands and the seas. While some dinos will appear rather mundane and plentiful, others are rare, which makes coming across them challenging.
Dinosaurs in Ark: Survival Ascended can be used for a variety of things. From serving as a mount for a mobile sea base to using them in combat, taming and riding the massive lizards are at the core of gameplay. Having a diverse stable of beasts is a goal that many people have in mind. While there will always be a focus on the dinosaurs with the very best stats, some deserve a mention for their style points alone.

 10  Spino (Spinosaurus Aquareliga) 
Diet: Carnivore
        

A fan-favorite dino, the Spino has been a popular choice since Evolved and continues to be one of the best dinos in Ark: Survival Ascended for their ability to move quickly across the land or in water. Though it walks on all fours, the massive size of the dinosaur makes it a competitor to upright creatures like the T-Rex. Spinos can be tamed by knocking them out. Though they can be a bit harder to find, they&#39;ll usually be around lakes, rivers, and bodies of water. A Spino Saddle is required to ride the beast.

Although it’s a remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, Survival Ascended has changed up some features that might make it feel like a different game.








 9  Troodon (Troodon Magnanimus) 
Diet: Carnivore
        

Though Troodon is relatively plentiful in the world of Ark: Survival Ascended, it doesn&#39;t stop them from being one of the coolest dinosaurs in the game. This incredibly smart dinosaur, reminiscent of raptors, hunts in packs and is highly aggressive. Great for PvP engagements, these dinosaurs may be a common occurrence but are still one of the coolest dinos nonetheless. Troodon is somewhat tricky to catch, as feeding it a live creature is required.
Troodon have the Tranquilized effect, which increases the bitten target&#39;s Torpor by 50 over 10 seconds and can quickly knock out players. 






 8  Quetzal (Quetzalcoatlus Conchapicem) 
Diet: Carnivore
        

The Quetzal is a giant prehistoric dinosaur and one of the best flying mounts capable of carrying heavy creatures on a platform saddle. Located all around The Island, the rare dino is incredibly hard to tame as it soars in the skies and typically has great stats. Larger and more intimidating than a Pterodactyl, the Quetzal is better suited at carrying large creatures than it is in combat engagements.





 7  Tusoteuthis (Tusoteuthis Vampyrus) 
Diet: Carnivore


 







The Tusoteuthis is an aggressive giant squid that requires a level of 91 to craft the Tusoteuthis Saddle. Taming this terrifying beast requires Black Pearls, unlike most other creatures that need to be knocked out. While the requirements are high, it&#39;s worth it, as the mount is one of the fastest underwater creatures that also has great stamina. One of the best harvesters in the game and a powerful grab attack that deals Torpor damage, investing in taming and riding the Tusoteuthis is worth it.





 6  Terror Bird (Phorusrhacidae Rapidesultor) 
Diet: Carnivore


 







Though the Terror Bird seems more of a meme than a useable dino, it&#39;s actually one of the quicker creatures if speed is leveled up. This bird can be knocked out and fed Regular Kibble, Gallimimus Eggs, Raw Mutton, or Raw Prime Meat and requires a Terror Bird Saddle. Though it is mostly only useful for scouting and flying around, breeding an army of Terror Birds is fun and worth showing off to teammates.

 5  Baryonyx (Baryonyx Aquafulgur) 
Diet: Piscivore
        

The Bary, or Baryonyx is a nimble land-sea dinosaur that has a lot of versatility in Ark: Survival Ascended. Found throughout the major rivers on The Island, Bary can usually be found in the deeper crags and caverns. Though large, the Baryonyx is small enough to fit in caves, and can traverse over land or deep sea, which makes the dinosaur a great mount choice. Like other creatures, Bary can be tamed by knocking it out and fed Regular Kibble or Raw Prime Fish Meat.





 4  Carcharodontosaurus (Carcharodontosaurus Medicupestis) 
Diet: Carnivore


 







Arguably one of the only dinos that can rival a Giga, the Carcharodontosaurus is a great all-around combat dino that can be tamed and mounted. With the Killing Frenzy buff, which increases movement speed and makes the dino immune to stun, and Blood Rage, which increases damage, the Carcharodontosaurus is not only one fo the coolest-looking dinosaurs in Ark, but one of the best in terms of stats.





 3  Plesiosaur (Elasmosaurus Remuspissa) 
Diet: Carnivore
        

A plesiosaur is the closest thing one can get to the Lochness Monster in Ark, as it appears very similar, at least visually, to the famed aquatic creature. With a long neck and massive body, this aquatic sea dinosaur is perfect for a mobile ship base or carrying materials over the water quickly. Fed Raw Mutton, Prime Meat, or Superior Kibble, this amazing sea beast is located in a pretty specific spot in the eastern ocean on The Island.





 2  Giga (Giganotosaurus Furiosa) 
Diet: Carnivore
        

The Giganotosaurus or Giga is one of the more iconic dinosaurs in all of Ark. Known as one of the best dinosaurs in the game and on The Island, it can be found rarely roaming areas in the North of the Island, but more consistently near the volcano. As one of the largest and most terrifying dinosaurs in the game, it makes for a great rideable mount in combat. Like most other dinos, to tame one, players will need a Giganotosaurus Saddle and Exceptional Kibble, Quetzal Egg, Raw Mutton, or Raw Prime Meat.





 1  Liopleurodon (Liopleurodon Magicus) 
Diet: Sweet Tooth
        

For those looking for a sparkling, tameable, and rideable aquatic dino, none other is arguably as visually cool as the Liopleurodon in Ark: Survival Ascended. Though only tameable and rideable for 30 minutes, the water dino provides the Mystic Skin Oil buff, which increases the value of loot boxes and makes nearby crates sparkle. Another aspect that makes the Liopleurodon unique is its rarity, as it&#39;s incredibly hard to find. Though it may not be the best water dinosaur for combat, especially because it only spawns for 30 minutes, it is one of the cooler dinosaurs to tame with Giant Bee Honey in the game.
Make sure to demount before trying to tame this dino, as the Liopleurodon will attack other tamed dinosaurs.
