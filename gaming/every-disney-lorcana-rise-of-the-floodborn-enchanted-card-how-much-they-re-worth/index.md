## Literature Review

Enchanted cards are the cream of the crop in Disney Lorcana, and Rise of the Floodborn introduces a whole new batch of serious power players.




Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn features a new array of Enchanted cards, and all of them are already commanding impressive prices on the secondary market. Although Enchanted cards feature the same abilities as non-Enchanted counterparts, the designation sets them apart as the highest rarity in the game and offers alternate art and a special foil treatment. Like Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter, Rise of the Floodborn features a total of 12 Enchanted cards of varying Ink colors and usage.
The value of a Disney Lorcana Enchanted card tends to come from a number of diverse factors. Featuring a fan-favorite character is one way to propel a card through the charts, as indicated by the expensive Enchanted Elsa card from The First Chapter. Cards that are of Legendary rarity in their non-Enchanted incarnations also tend to get a boost, as do any that prove to be a major part of the gameplay meta.
            
 
 10 Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Cards Worth The Most Money 
Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is out in select retailers, and some cards are already commanding high prices on the secondary market.












 








 12  Namaari: Morning Mist 
216/204, Steel
        

Namaari: Morning Mist offers the defensive protection of a Bodyguard card while adding a bit of unique aggression with the Blades ability, which lets her challenge ready characters. With only two strength, however, she isn&#39;t likely to deal serious devastation on the offensive front. The art depicts the warrior atop a cat-like Serlot creature, while the standard issue version of the card just shows her with two blades. On TCGPlayer, Namaari: Morning Mist has a market price of $158, an impressive number that still pales compared to other Legendary options.





 11  Pete: Bad Guy 
209/204, Emerald
        

The Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn Enchanted card Pete: Bad Guy is built to combo with action cards, which boost his strength until he can activate his Who&#39;s Next? ability for extra lore as well. The Ward ability keeps him well-protected from cards that hurt or eliminate chosen characters, forcing opponents to fight him head-on. Mickey&#39;s enemy is depicted with a familiar angry expression and a brandished fist on the Enchanted variant art, and TCGPlayer lists a value of $167 for the card.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana&#39;s Rise of the Floodborn Starter Decks Review 
Disney Lorcana&#39;s Rise of the Floodborn starter decks feel like an ideal entry point to the trading card game, and new mechanics feel interesting.








 10  Arthur: Wizard&#39;s Apprentice 
207/204, Amethyst
        

The Sword in the Stone has an impressive showing in Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn, with Merlin receiving a number of cards based on various transformations from the film. The king-to-be gets the crown, however, with the Enchanted card, Arthur: Wizard&#39;s Apprentice. Arthur makes it possible to return chosen characters to a player&#39;s hand for extra lore, working nicely with an Amber/Amethyst deck emphasizing cheap character cards. This Rise of the Floodborn Enchanted Card commands a tidy sum of $169, according to the TCGPlayer market price.





 9  Lady Tremaine: Imperious Queen 
211/204, Ruby
        

Lady Tremaine: Imperious Queen forces an opponent to banish one of their own characters, so its best played when they only have strong cards to get rid of. A Shift 4 ability can help her get out on the board early for a little extra kick. The Enchanted card&#39;s art depicts Lady Tremaine in a much more striking getup than anything she wears in Cinderella, with the fashionable flair that might be more expected of Cruella de Vil. On TCGPlayer, Lady Tremaine: Imperious Queen has a market value of $176.
            
 
 Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards 
Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is releasing soon, with new cards arriving via Illumineer&#39;s Troves, Gift Sets, and more in this second set.








 8  Shere Khan: Menacing Predator 
212/204, Ruby
        

The Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn card Shere Khan: Menacing Predator is an easy ticket to lore generation, offering one up every time any of the player&#39;s characters challenge an opponent. While the regular version of the card depicts the intimidating tiger prowling through the jungle, the Enchanted version shows him in a more directly aggressive form with claws bared. TCGPlayer places the valuation for the Enchanted Shere Khan: Menacing Predator at $183.





 7  Beast: Relentless 
210/204, Emerald


 







Beast: Relentless is a true beast on the battlefield, with the ability to ready every time an opposing character is damaged. The Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn Enchanted variant renders a particular dynamic version of the stormy climax of Beauty and the Beast, showing the Beast leaping through the air with a clawed hand outstretched. Even the regular version of this card is an impressive Legendary, and the Enchanted card commands $189, according to TCGPlayer.





 6  Madam Mim: Purple Dragon 
208/204, Amethyst
        

Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn&#39;s Madam Mim: Purple Dragon is an extremely powerful card, but it can be a bit situational. The I Win, I Win! abililty requires the player to return two cards to their hand to successfully deploy her, which can be useful at times but is often a significant loss of board control. With excellent stats across the board and an Evasive feature, however, it&#39;s no surprise that TCGPlayer puts her value at $208.
            
 
 Everything In Disney Lorcana: Rise Of The Floodborn Illumineer&#39;s Trove 
Similar to The First Chapter of Disney Lorcana, its second set, Rise of the Floodborn, will include an Illumineer’s Trove full of great products.








 5  Hercules: Divine Hero 
215/204, Steel
        

Hercules: Divine Hero represents the demigod&#39;s might in Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn, with six strength and a plus-two Resist ability to bolster its three willpower. The Enchanted art shows a particularly triumphant pose struck by the hero as he shatters a falling column. Hercules: Divine Hero doesn&#39;t yet have a listed market value on TCGPlayer at the time of writing, but the lowest-priced copy for sale on the site comes in at $200.





 4  Snow White: Well Wisher 
206/204, Amber


 







The standard issue Legendary of Snow White: Well Wisher depicts Disney&#39;s first princess smiling as birds alight upon her, but the Enchanted shows her outright breaking into song with a few animals gathered in the background. She certainly has plenty to sing about, as questing with this Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn card allows one character card to be returned to a player&#39;s hand from the discard. TCGPlayer lists her market value as an impressive $215.





 3  Sisu: Divine Water Dragon 
214/204, Sapphire
        

Sisu: Divine Water Dragon is a potential major player for decks seeking more control in Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn. Every time this Enchanted card quests, a player can look at the top two cards of their deck and take one while returning any unclaimed cards to the bottom of the deck. Sisu comes in with a significantly higher valuation than her Raya and the Last Dragon Enchanted counterpart Namaari: Morning Mist, listed on TCGPlayer as $259.





 2  Cinderella: Ballroom Sensation 
205/204, Amber


 







Cinderella: Ballroom Sensation stands out as a one-drop card that features a unique ability for the price, with Singer giving her the power to sing songs that would usually require three ink or a three-drop character to deploy. Her Enchanted artwork highlights the stunning ballroom gown she wears in the film, suffused with a glow that shows the magical hand at play in its creation. The TCGPlayer value reflects both the powerful utility and beautiful card design, with a whopping $299 market price.

 1  Alice: Growing Girl 
213/204, Sapphire
        

The Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn Enchanted card Alice: Growing Girl is a combo machine, doling out support when other characters quest that she can apply to herself to ultimately increase both strength and lore generation. The standard Legendary art shows her inside a room that can barely contain her skyrocketing size, while the Legendary variant skips ahead to the point where she&#39;s more or less wearing a house as a shirt. TCGPlayer puts Alice: Growing Girl&#39;s value at $300, just barely edging out Cinderella: Ballroom Sensation as the most expensive Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn Enchanted card.
