## Literature Review

The Lava Elemental is a tough enemy found in the Underdark in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Players will need to employ specific tactics to defeat this foe.





Exploring the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 allows the party to claim pieces of unique Adamantine gear, making it one of the most important side quests in Act One. Although you don&#39;t actually need to beat the Lava Elemental for this quest, it&#39;s still highly likely that you&#39;ll encounter it while exploring the area. As such, it&#39;s a good idea to prepare your party to face off against it.

On Balanced difficulty at Level 6, the Lava Elemental has 95 Health and AC12, making it one of the game&#39;s tougher enemies. It&#39;s totally immune to Fire Damage, and has both Poison and Piercing Resistance, so some of the best spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 such as Fireball won&#39;t have any effect. You should also watch out for its unique abilities:

  Magmatic Regeneration allows the Lava Elemental to regain 20-120 hit points when starting a turn in lava.   Magmatic Disturbance causes the lava in the pit to burst and explode, inflicting AOE damage on nearby party members.   Create Lava creates new pools of lava underneath the creature&#39;s feet.  

However, the Lava Elemental is vulnerable to Cold Damage, doubling the total damage it takes from Cold attacks. It also has a low Dexterity stat and -1 Initiative, so the party has a good chance of attacking first. To exploit these weaknesses and beat the creature, draw its attention and lure it out of the lava pit.




This should stop it from healing, so you can focus on your goal: dealing as much damage as you can to the Lava Elemental in a single turn, combining and chaining multiple attacks. The creature will use Create Lava to try and trigger its healing ability, so it&#39;s highly recommended you finish this fight as quickly as possible.



Elixirs of Fire Resistance are an essential item for this fight. They grant both Fire Resistance and immunity to Burning effects, which keeps the party safe from the lava.




          

Prioritize any spells and attacks that deal Cold Damage. Bone Chill also works well, as it prevents the Lava Elemental from regaining hit points for a single turn. With a few lucky rolls and a well-balanced party composition, your band of adventurers should be able to defeat the Lava Elemental in two or three turns.






Alternatively, players can use terrain to their advantage. YouTube creator Vinci found an easy way to defeat the Lava Elemental by blasting the creature off a high cliff using Thunderwave.

 
 






 What To Do After Beating The Lava Elemental In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Once you&#39;ve defeated the Lava Elemental, make sure to loot its body for some rare gemstones - these can be sold off to traders for a bit of extra gold. As a nice bonus, the death of the Lava Elemental calms down the lava, making the area easier to navigate.



Make sure to open the chest on the small platform at the end of the path. This contains Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Sentient Amulet, opening up a new side quest.




This is the only Lava Elemental that appears in-game. However, you can use the same out-of-the-box thinking and tactics elsewhere, as the lands of Faerun contain many challenging foes. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gives players lots of different and often unconventional ways of winning fights, and beating the Lava Elemental is a great opportunity to test your strategic thinking skills.
