## Literature Review

Getting 100% exploration for all areas in Genshin Impact is a great endgame activity for those who have beaten most the game&#39;s story content.





Similar to how you increase your Adventurer Rank in Genshin Impact, each named region in the game has levels of progress you can see. By looking at your main map, you will see that 100% completion of an area means finding every collectible that spawns in that zone. While there are more details to this, you can recognize that fully exploring places is optional and not tied to any achievements.






A couple of examples of named regions with exploration progress in Teyvat are the Dragonspine in Mondstadt and Narukami Island in the Inazuma area.




                  Genshin Impact 4.3 Leaks: Farming Will Get Easier (&amp; Less Annoying)   It seems like farming Artifacts and materials in Genshin Impact will get a bit easier starting with Version 4.3, according to a new set of leaks.   


 How To Get 100% Exploration Progress In a Region In Genshin Impact 
          

Finding every collectible, discovering each Chest and Seelie, and unlocking all the important structures in an area will allow you to reach 100% exploration in Genshin Impact. The easiest of these is the structures, including Teleportation Spots or common fast travel waypoints on your map. Statues of the Seven, Shrines, and Domains must also be accessed to meet the right progress goal.






Shrines are only unlocked through Keys, which you receive during story quests connected to the Shrine&#39;s location or through objectives tied to the Adventurer&#39;s Guild.




All Collectible resources contribute to an area&#39;s exploration percentage, with items like Geoculus, Electroculus, and Genshin Impact&#39;s Anemoculus. Your map should mark the exact location of these items as you travel around a zone. Look for a helpful marker or icon tied to each resource, especially if you have a high enough Reputation Level to make the Geoculus/Anemoculus Tracker.

Any type of Chest found in an area also raises the exploration process of the location, with Seelies being just as crucial in Genshin Impact. Complete quests in a zone to uncover Chests or use a Treasure Tracker received by earning a high enough Reputation Level in a specific region to mark them on your map.



Seelies are found when you activate your Elemental Sight near an area&#39;s empty Seelie Court, creating a blue trail leading you in the right direction.







The only location that is an exception to the general exploration goals is Dragonspire, which has an extra objective tied to Crimson Agates. You need to collect all 80 Agates to raise the area&#39;s percentage by leveling up the main tree in the region. Doing this will allow you to get 100% exploration for the area in Genshin Impact and give you many different rewards.
