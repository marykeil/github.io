## Literature Review

The Summoner Archetype in Remnant 2 appears in Yaesha and allows players to control Root minions if they can purchase the Faded Grimoire first.





Much like other Archetypes, The Summoner is a secret archteype that cannot be used as a starter. Instead, the only way to unlock it is by progressing the story. You will be able to unlock it once you visit Yaesha and start collecting a unique currency found in Remnant 2.




                  Remnant 2 Ending Explained (&amp; How It Sets Up DLC)   Remnant 2&#39;s ending may seem unsatisfying at first glance, but a secret post-credits scene gives a little more context to what might be coming.   


 What Is The Summoner Archetype&#39;s Engram 
          

Every Archetype has an Engram, a special item, that switches a character from one Archetype to that of the Engram. For example, Remnant 2&#39;s Gunslinger Archetype has an Iron Cylinder for its Engram. The Summoner&#39;s Engram is the Tome of the Bringer, a creepy brown book with a skull wrapped in roots on the cover.

Similar to the Gunslinger Archetype in Remnant 2, you are required to craft the Tome of the Bringer to unlock the Summoner Archetype. This can be done with Wallance from Ward 13 and costs 1,000 Scrap, 10 Lumenite Crystals, and a special item called the Faded Grimoire, which can be purchased from Yaesha.






 Where To Buy The Faded Grimoire To Unlock The Summoner 
          

The Faded Grimoire comes from Bloodmoon Altars found throughout Yaesha. Bloodmoon Altars act as merchants in Remnant 2, offering a variety of Summoner items. The Faded Fromoire costs 1,500 Scrap, 5 Lumenite Crystals, and 15 Blood Moon Essence.



Blood Moon Essence is a special material that can only be collected in Yaesha during a Blood Moon. If the Blood Moon is not active, you will need to leave and come back to Yaesha later.




When the sky in Yaesha is red, the Blood Moon is active. During the Blood Moon, you need to hunt down glowing purple balls called Root Wisps. Each time a player shoots a Root Wisp, it will drop one Blood Moon Essence. You will need to farm a lot of Blood Moon Essence to purchase all the items offered at Bloodmoon Altars. Once you have 15 Blood Moon Essence you will be able to unlock the Summoner Archetype in Remnant 2.
