## Literature Review

Prison Brides season 1 features UK based Romanian student Andreea, who travels to the US to marry inmate Cage. Is their relationship doomed?




The inaugural episode of Prison Brides season 1 recently premiered on Lifetime with seven couples, including Andreea and Cage. The show follows seven international women from around the world who found love in American prisons. The show documents these women&#39;s journeys to the United States to meet and marry the American federal prisoners they&#39;ve fallen in love with. These men are all in prison for violent crimes, whether it&#39;s carjacking, armed robbery, or even second-degree murder.




Like the other couples that Prison Brides season 1 follows, Andreea and Cage met through an online pen pal program and fell in love. Andreea intends to move to the United States to marry Cage. She will have to withstand the judgments and concerns of her friends and family if she wants to be with the man she loves. Though Cage is eager to prove that he can be the man Andreea needs, there are signs that their marriage is doomed.

 Cage Is Doing 50 Years 
          

When he was 17 years old, Prison Brides season 1 cast member Cage played the lead role in an armed robbery involving six other people. He was accused of being the leader of a teen burglary ring that carried out a series of home invasions starting in late 2012. In 2014, Cage was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Since he has done fewer than 10 years, Andreea won&#39;t be able to be with her husband for a long time. Few marriages could survive such a brutal separation.






 Andreea &amp; Cage Can&#39;t Be Along Together 
          

Andreea, who was born in Romania, grew up in Italy before relocating to London to pursue an education. She was 22 years old when she started corresponding online with Cage. After three years, the couple decided to take their relationship to the next level by getting married. They have never met in person, and, considering his sentence, they may never get to be alone together. Andreea is moving to the U.S. to be close to Cage&#39;s prison, but she underestimates how lonely she will be. Some have questioned how she could accept a marriage without physical intimacy, but Andreea insists that she cares more about their spiritual connection.



 Cage&#39;s Family Background Draws Him To Andreea More 
          




Cage was raised by a single mother and had no support from his father. Lacking guidance and a father figure, he found himself in trouble as a teen. Cage told Prison Brides cameras that Andreeaâ€™s smile was what initially got his attention. He says that she makes him feel alive. He tells a story about her trip to Rome, where receiving pictures from her made it feel as if he went to Rome with her. Currently incarcerated in Texas, Cage eagerly awaits his marriage to Andreea and hopes to start their life together once he is eligible for parole in 2037.



Prison Brides airs Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. EST on Lifetime.
