## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 tempts players with unlocking awesome mind flayer powers by using the illithid tadpoles they find, but which powers are best?





[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
From the moment Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 begins, NPCs and companion characters are exclaiming how the illithid parasites in the party&#39;s brain are dangerous and should be extracted. Perhaps this is why 70% of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players avoid using any of the powers of offer. Some may be concerned with the consequences, while for others it might be for roleplaying reasons, but for those who want to add more tadpoles, it&#39;s best to know which powers are the ones to focus on.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Black Hole 
Partial-Illithid Class Action, Requires Either Displace Or Psionic Dominance To Be Unlocked
        

Black Hole is a really fun power for controlling the battlefield in BG3 as on a bonus action summons a black hole and pulls all enemies into it. The targets must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be slowed, which halves their movement speed and prevents them from taking reactions. After casting Black Hole the first time, five more black holes can be summoned before the ability recharges on a short rest.
The slowed condition halves a target&#39;s movement speed, reduces their AC and Dexterity saving throws by two, and reduces the number of attacks they can make to one. The target cannot take reactions and can only take a bonus action or an action, but not both. 






 9  Illithid Expertise 
Partial-Illithid Passive Feature, Requires Either Luck Of The Far Realms Or Fracture Psyche To Be Unlocked
        

Illithid Expertise is a great passive illithid power that acts in a similar way to a rogue&#39;s expertise or a bard&#39;s jack-of-all-trades features. With this power, the character will gain expertise in Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation checks. With expertise, the character doubles their proficiency bonus added to the skill check, making Illithid Expertise very useful for low charisma BG3 characters who may otherwise struggle to make this ability check.





 8  Shield Of Thralls 
Class Action, Requires Transfuse Health To Be Unlocked
        

Shield of Thralls lets the character activate a condition called Volatile Shield on an ally as a bonus action once per short rest, which gives them 10 temporary hit points. If the hit points are depleted by incoming damage, the shield bursts forcing all nearby enemies to make Intelligence saving throws or be stunned for one turn. This is great for keeping squishier BG3 party members up and fighting or if they get surrounded by enemies.





 7  Favourable Beginnings 
Passive Feature, No Requirements


 







Favourable Beginnings is one of the first illithid powers a character can unlock in BG3 and it is easily one of the best. This passive ability adds the character&#39;s proficiency bonus to either the first attack roll or ability check made against a target. Favourable Beginnings is best used when first speaking with an NPC and can make initial Persuasion or Deception checks much easier to pass.





 6  Displacer Beast Shape 
Partial-Illithid Class Action, Requires Either Stage Fright Or Absorb Intellect To Be Unlocked


 







With illithid powers, it isn&#39;t just druids who get to turn into beasts as characters who have used the Astral-Touched Tadpole get the chance to have their own version of wild shape in BG3. Displacer Beast Shape is exactly as it sounds, allowing the character to transform into a displacer beast once per long rest. As a displacer beast, the character has some great attacks such as Tentacle Whip and Displace as well as the ability to create illusory copies that can also attack enemies.
As with wild shape, the characters take on the physical stats of the displacer beast but keep their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The displacer beast form has 85 hit points and drops if reduced to zero. 






 5  Cull The Weak 
Passive Feature, Requires Concentrated Blast To Be Unlocked
        

Cull the Weak is a passive illithid power that can be toggled on or off and is a powerful but dangerous tool to have in BG3. With this ability toggled on when the character brings a target&#39;s hit points down to a number less than the number of illithid powers they have, the target dies instantly, and all nearby creatures take one to four psychic damage. This means that if a character with five illithid powers brings an enemy to four or fewer hit points, the enemy will die. One thing to look out for with Cull the Weak is that the psychic damage does not discriminate between allies or enemies.





 4  Luck Of The Far Realms 
Passive Feature, Requires Favourable Beginnings To Be Unlocked
        

Luck of the Far Realms is another early illithid power that remains one of the best right through to the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This feature allows the character to use their reaction once per long rest to turn any successful attack into a critical hit. This is already powerful with the option to have a crit on demand, but when paired will abilities like sneak attack or smite, then it is possible to one-shot even tough enemies.





 3  Psionic Backlash 
Reaction Feature, Requires Concentrated Blast To Be Unlocked
        

Psionic Backlash is a fantastic illithid power that can be used as a reaction to deal damage to nearby spellcasters. This feature allows the character to react when a spell is cast within nine meters of them to deal 1d4 psychic damage for every spell level. Psionic Backlash is great as it is possible to immediately break an enemy spellcaster&#39;s concentration on a spell with the damage, which can really add up by Act 3 of BG3 with the party facing higher-level spellcasters.





 2  Freecast 
Partial-Illithid Passive Feature, Requires Either Shield Of Thralls Or Mind Sanctuary To Be Unlocked
        

Freecast is a must-have illithid power for any spellcaster in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 as it allows the character to remove any resource cost for their next action, such as using a spell slot, using Channel Divinity, or using an Action Surge. This passive feature can be toggled on or off and can be used only once per long rest. Freecast is best saved for when going into a boss fight to allow a high-level spell or once-per-long rest ability to be used without cost.





 1  Fly 
Partial-Illithid Movement, Unlocked Automatically By Astral-Touched Tadpole


 







Fly is one of the best spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, allowing the caster to reposition themselves anywhere on the battlefield. However, this would usually need a level three spell slot and requires concentration, meaning the spell can drop. However, for those brave enough to take the Astral-Touched Tadpole this ability is unlocked automatically, does not require an action to use, and has unlimited uses. This is fantastic for spellcasters or other ranged attackers as it allows them to get far away from melee enemies and gain advantage from being on higher ground.
