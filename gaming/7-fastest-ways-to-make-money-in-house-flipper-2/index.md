 7  Do Some Odd Jobs 
Keep Busy Making Money


 







Like the odd jobs in the first House Flipper, multiple jobs around town need doing while you wait to buy and flip a house. There are a lot of different options that will be sent your way, and these will also make a fair amount of money for your troubles. While some of them are more tedious than others and the neighbors might be a little annoying, Tom will keep you entertained and there are worthwhile advantages, such as unlocking tools and giving you the cash to flip the house of your dreams.





 6  Perform Assemblies 
Mini-Games With Benefits


In the first game, players had to assemble every larger piece of equipment in the game, but in this one, they are more optional. However, completing these mini-games and getting 3 Stars, as shown in YouTuber Quick Tip’s video about assembling a clock in the game above, will get you discounts on future items of the same type. This means you will save money and keep more money for yourself instead of spending it on the more boring necessities that buyers will demand.
These mini-games are timed and players will have to be fast and accurate to get the 3 Stars, so don&#39;t be afraid to keep trying until you get the relevant perks. 






 5  Cheaper Versions of Items 
Look At All The Options Before Purchasing
        

When it comes to flipping houses, or doing jobs that will require you to purchase items, most of the time there is not a specified quality of item the customers want. In those cases, picking the cheapest version will net you money in the long run, and it will make things a little easier for you to make the houses look nice, improve their value, but also save money. It might not please the pickiest of the buyers in House Flipper, but it will save enough money to get the higher auction price.





 4  Unlock All The Tools 
Gotta Get Them All


Tools are unlocked by completing certain jobs at the beginning of the story mode, as can be seen in YouTuber EmeraldTriesGaming&#39;s video. Do not start flipping houses at auction until you have completed all the jobs if you want to earn the most money as quickly as possible.
You will lose money if you are unable to fix or complete something that the client wants, and that is something you cannot afford early in the game.

There are a few Perks that will either save or earn you more money, as well as one full Perk tree that will affect how much money you make. All of these are well worth investing in early, and they can help you get enough money to flip houses faster. The Perks are as follows:
 Nothing Goes To Waste 
 Construction Manager 
 Paint Saver/Pigment Economy 
 Selling House Perk Upgrade Line 






 2  Selling Unnecessary Items 
Zapping Items For Money
        

Once you begin flipping houses, you will want to go through the house and sell everything you don’t need to keep. The sell item tool in House Flipper 2 makes a return from the first game, and even some of the things that look like trash might earn a little cash on the flipside.
This can save quite a lot of money on the flip - more than you might expect. It is also one of the most satisfying parts of this job simulator game when you see things disappear and dollar signs appear.





 1  Sell Houses 
Make The House Look Good
        

At the end of the day, you are going to make the most money the fastest from selling a house at auction. However, all of the above tips will help you sell the house for the most money possible, and this will generate more money when you auction a house.
The goal is to have the biggest differential between what you spent and what you sell it for later. You will have to have a little patience, but you will make money quicker this way than you would otherwise in House Flipper 2.
