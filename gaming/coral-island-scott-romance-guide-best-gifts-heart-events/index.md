## Literature Review

Scott is a dateable archeologist who works at the local Museum in Coral Island. He&#39;s the only townie who will appreciate a geode as a gift.





Scott is an active individual, so he bounces around Starlet Town a lot throughout the week. He has a wide range of interests, making it easy to collect his favorite gifts. His Heart Events slowly build up to a secret project and reveal the nerd under his shield of romantic charm.





 Scott&#39;s Daily Schedule 
          

Scott&#39;s schedule is easy to manage, as it stays the same throughout Spring, Fall, and Winter. Most of his days are split between the Museum and the Cavern, but he makes a variety of pit stops throughout the week. He spends half of his Summer lounging around the Beach and tends to visit the local tavern, Fishensips, on the weekends. Out of all the marriage candidates available in Coral Island, Scott is one of the easiest to track down.

 Best Gifts For Romancing Scott 
          

Scott has a wide range of favorite gifts, including certain types of fish and consumables. One category of items that he adores, however, are the geodes that hold precious resources once broken at Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith, home of romanceable characters Pablo and Rafael. Scott loves all geode types, making them a great gift option. Geodes can be mined from the Cavern, which unlocks on Day 5 of the player&#39;s life in Starlet Town.\

Out of the five types of geodes available in Coral Island, earth geodes are the best gifts for Scott. They are the first geodes you&#39;ll collect in the Cavern, as the earth mine takes the upper levels of the area. Earth geodes are the most common type of geode, so you can give one to Scott and not miss out on too much. He is also the only character who likes geodes as gifts, making them extra special for him.






Make sure to head into the Cavern early in your first Spring if you want to find an earth geode for Scott&#39;s birthday. He has one of the earliest birthdays in the game on Spring 12. Unlike many townies in Coral Island, since the Cavern opens so early in the game, it is easy to get Scott one of his loved gifts as a birthday present. If you have already given him two gifts the week of his birthday, you can still give him a birthday gift.




                  10 Best Crops For Every Season In Coral Island   Every season on Coral Island unlocks different crops, which can be used to improve relationships, increase health &amp; energy, or sell for high prices.

 All Heart Events For Scott 
          




All of Scott&#39;s Heart Events get you one step closer to dating and marrying this Coral Island bachelor. Some require work on specific Scott-centric quests to complete, while others are restricted to certain types of weather. In an interesting twist on most Heart Events, if you want to unlock Scott&#39;s 10 Heart Event, you&#39;ll need to bring the Museum up to Level 2 at minimum. Otherwise, his Heart Events are fairly standard.

                  Does Coral Island&#39;s Underwater Puzzle Have A Solution?   Coral Island players have struggled to solve the Underwater Puzzle since Early Access. It has no clear solution, but may hint at a future update.   

 Hearts  Day  Time Period  Location   2 Hearts  Any  10:00 - 13:00  Community Center Library   3 Hearts  Sunny Weather  10:00 - 14:00  Zarah Boat Pier   5 Hearts  Sunny Weather  8:00 - 13:00  Town Center   7 Hearts  Any  12:00 - 23:59  Fishensips   8 Hearts  Sunny or Windy Weather  8:00 - 15:00  Lake   8 Hearts  Any  19:00 - 23:59  1 Main Ave   10 Hearts  Any  19:00 - 3:00  Museum   






Once you finish Scott&#39;s second 8 Heart Event, you&#39;ll need to pay a visit to Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith and purchase a locket. By giving this locket to Scott, the two of you will start dating and you can build your relationship up to 10 Hearts. When his 10 Heart Event is complete, you can propose to him. From there, you can enjoy a beautiful wedding with a loving partner in Coral Island.
