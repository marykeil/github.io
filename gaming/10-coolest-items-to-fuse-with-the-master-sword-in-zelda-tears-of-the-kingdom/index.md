# 10 Coolest Items To Fuse With The Master Sword In Zelda Tears of the Kingdom


## SUMMARY 


 The Master Sword is one of 
Tears of the Kingdom
&#39;s most useful items, since it regenerates rather than breaking completely. 
 This makes it especially useful for experimenting with Fuse combinations, and its relatively high damage makes it a good weapon to attach rarer items to.

## Literature Review

With the most exciting Fuse materials in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can take the power of the Master Sword a whole step further.




The Master Sword is the most iconic weapon in the Zelda series, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gives it even more utility, gaining extra benefits with the help of Fuse. Link&#39;s newfound ability to attach items to his armaments has resulted in some creative and awe-inspiring combinations, ranging from death-dealing weapons of destruction to ones that are plain silly. With hundreds of different materials to choose from, though, players may be unsure of which items to attach to the Master Sword for the best results.
After all, the Master Sword&#39;s damage in TOTKisn&#39;t all that great on its own; its strength lies in the fact that it&#39;s unbreakable. Unlike every other weapon in the game, when the Master Sword runs out of durability, it won&#39;t permanently break. Instead, it&#39;ll simply go on cooldown, requiring ten real-life minutes to charge before becoming usable again. Thus, even though any attached materials will disappear during the charging process, the Master Sword remains the best weapon to work with, as its indestructible nature makes it ideal for experimenting with the coolest Fuse items in Tears of the Kingdom.

 10  Hydrant 
Zonai Device
        

If the heat of the battle becomes too much to bear, Link can cool things down by Fusing a Hydrant to the Master Sword in TOTK. Attaching the Zonai device to the sword will cause it to spew water with each hit, effectively drenching any nearby enemies. Doing so won&#39;t directly damage them, and it&#39;s only truly useful for imparting the &#34;wet&#34; status effect, which makes lightning strikes fatal, and combos well with any Zora weapon. Still, Fusing a Hydrant to the Master Sword makes for some undeniably gorgeous visuals, and it&#39;ll let players channel their inner Sidon.





 9  Gems 
Most Commonly Found In Caves
        

Provided that Link doesn&#39;t mind missing out on a few rupees, gems can also make for some of the coolest Master Sword fusions in Tears of the Kingdom. Elemental gems in particular can spice up any encounter by turning the sword into a magic wand; for instance, attaching a ruby will result in flaming fireballs, whereas attaching a topaz will lead to orbs of electricity. In most cases, Fusing isn&#39;t the best use of diamonds in TOTK, but since the precious gemstones add a whopping 25 attack power, they can also be a powerful option in a pinch (provided Link is willing to part with the prospect of 500 rupees).

 8  Lizalfos Tail 
Dropped By Lizalfos
        

Though somewhat morbid in nature, Lizalfos tails make for some of the most hilarious Master Sword fusions in Tears of the Kingdom. Pairing the legendary blade with this monster part effectively turns it into a whip, with the tail unfurling and lashing out in a wide radius with each swing. Not only is it a comedic way to defeat monsters (specifically Lizalfos), but it almost doubles Link&#39;s range as well, allowing him to strike his enemies to death via tail from a safe distance. They&#39;re especially effective Fused to one-handed weapons, increasing their range drastically without sacrificing attack speed.





 7  Naydra&#39;s Scale 
Obtained By Striking Naydra&#39;s Body
        

When farming dragon materials in Tears of the Kingdom, scales tend to be the easiest parts to obtain, since they don&#39;t necessarily require landing on the beast or overly precise aim. However, in the case of the frosty dragon Naydra, its scales happen to be some of the coolest items to Fuse the Master Sword with, too. Fitting the weapon with Naydra&#39;s Scale will make it ice-cold, freezing enemies on contact. Scales from the fire dragon Dinraal and lightning dragon Farosh are still effective, but Naydra&#39;s is decidedly the best with its ability to deal hefty damage and stun enemies in place.





 6  Gleeok Frost Horn 
Dropped By Frost Gleeoks


 







Similarly, Gleeok Frost Horns are a valuable monster part that can turn Link into a cold-blooded killer, without compromising style. Unlike the dragons, players will need to defeat a Frost Gleeok in order to obtain the material, but it&#39;ll ultimately be worth the blood, sweat, and tears, because Fusing a Gleeok Frost Horn to the Master Sword can make quick work of almost any adversary. Not only does it add an extra 30 attack damage, but it&#39;ll also freeze enemies on impact, which can mean an instant kill for low-health enemies or fire-elemental enemies.
There are only three Frost Gleeoks in Tears of the Kingdom, located in Biron Snowshelf, Tabantha Frontier, and Gerudo Summit. They respawn with every Blood Moon. 






 5  Courser Bee Honey 
Found Attached To Trees
        

While it may not be the most practical of combinations, Courser Bee Honey is undoubtedly one of the coolest items to Fuse with the Master Sword. Swinging a honeycomb-imbued Master Sword will cause a swarm of angry bees to appear, chasing down the first target they spot. Link is not excluded from the list of potential victims, so players will need to be careful not to accidentally use the weapon while they&#39;re alone. Still, even with the added risk of self-injury, it&#39;s hard to deny the excitement that comes from becoming a bee whisperer with Courser Bee Honey in TOTK. Unleashing swarms of bees is hilariously chaotic, especially when fighting larger groups of enemies.





 4  Silver Lynel Saber Horn 
Dropped By Silver Lynels


 







When it comes to dishing out absurd amounts of damage, though, the Silver Lynel Saber Horn is the best item to Fuse with the Master Sword in Tears of the Kingdom. Bearing an additional 55 points of attack power, the Master Sword will deal a deadly 85 damage with each strike, slicing through even the toughest enemies like butter. Thus, even though Fusing the Silver Lynel Saber Horn to the Master Sword won&#39;t result in any special effects, players will undoubtedly feel cool as they wipe out their foes with ease.





 3  Cannon 
Zonai Device
        

For pure, unadulterated destruction, the Cannon is hands-down one of the coolest items to Fuse with in Tears of the Kingdom. While the Zonai device can be used to build some truly deadly Ultrahand creations in TOTK, it&#39;s arguably even more satisfying to combine it with the Master Sword. The Cannon will transform the melee weapon into a makeshift gun, letting players unleash chaos with their own two hands - and not much can compete with shooting long-range, highly volatile projectiles across the map, bringing demise to pesky monsters from afar.





 2  Star Fragment 
Fall From The Sky At Night
        

Being one of the rarest resources in the game, obtaining Star Fragments in Tears of the Kingdom can be troublesome, since they only appear at night and must be collected before they disappear at sunrise. They are incredibly helpful, however, as Fusing a Star Fragment to the Master Sword will saturate it with the power of light, creating bright, white luminescent orbs with each swing. The glowing particles are beautiful enough from a visual standpoint alone, but they are also incredibly helpful when exploring the Depths, as the orbs illuminate a significant area and last for some time before fading away.





 1  Light Dragon Horn 
Obtained By Striking The Light Dragon&#39;s Horns


 







However, the coolest item to Fuse with the Master Sword in Tears of the Kingdom is a Light Dragon Horn. Attaching this iridescent item to the Master Sword will not only imbue it with 20 extra damage, but also with the ability to life-steal from attacking enemies. Food for replenishing hearts is plentiful, but cooking can become tedious, so stocking up on Light Dragon Horns may be worth the extra effort. Getting up to the Light Dragon can be tricky, but doing so is required to get the Master Sword anyway, so it&#39;s worth grabbing a Light Dragon Horn right away, as it&#39;s the coolest item to Fuse with the Master Sword in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
