## Literature Review

At The Game Awards 2023, new trailers and first-time reveals made up a huge part of the show. Here’s every major announcement made at TGA 2023.




The Game Awards 2023 isn&#39;t just an opportunity to celebrate the best games of the year; it also gives developers the chance to announce what they&#39;re working on next. In between presentations, speeches, and performances, each year&#39;s TGA show takes the opportunity to air trailers for every manner of video game release. Brand-new reveals, long-awaited updates, DLC announcements, hardware, merch, accessories - these are as much a part of the show as the awards themselves, and remain a big part of why many keep watching.




The Game Awards 2023 did away with the now-iconic &#34;World Premiere&#34; title card for some of its trailers, previously used to denote when a trailer was airing for the first time that night. However, that doesn&#39;t mean there were any fewer big reveals this year. As always, TGA 2023 was full of welcome updates, intriguing reveals, and massive surprises. Here&#39;s everything there is to know.

 TGA 2023: Highlights 
          

Persona 3 Reload, the fresh-faced remake of the groundbreaking game in the Persona series, finally debuted a new trailer, featuring footage of social sim and dungeon-crawling gameplay, now with more complete voice acting and a whole new graphics engine. God of War Ragnarök revealed its long-awaited DLC, Valhalla, for a stunningly close release date of December 12 - and it’s absolutely free for anyone who already owns the game. Skull &amp; Bones finally set a release date for February 16, 2024, while The Finals moved its release date up to the very same night as the awards.

Hideo Kojima and Jordan Peele also made an appearance to announce what can only be described as a surreal horror…something, OD, which Kojima called a cross between a game and a movie. OD sounds suspiciously similar to PT, but it&#39;s hard to say what exactly it is. It may not have been a trailer, but Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth got a little love, with The Game Awards Orchestra performing its official theme song live. FF16, meanwhile, announced new DLC: Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide. Capcom also revealed an upcoming game in one of its most beloved series: Monster Hunter: Wilds, out in 2025.




Matthew McConaughey appeared on stage to announce his first ever video game appearance in Exodus, a time-bending science fiction title from Archetype Entertainment. Gonzo the Muppet took the stage to talk about his love for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Anthony Mackie, star of the Twisted Metal adaptation on Peacock, presented the award for Best Ongoing Game to Cyberpunk 2077, celebrating the release of its electrifying Phantom Liberty DLC this year. Timothée Chalamet, introduced as &#34;YouTuber ModdedController360&#34; in a shoutout to his long-buried gaming channel, presented the award for Game of the Year.

And as far as awards go, Alan Wake 2 and Baldur’s Gate 3 were the projected big winners this year, tied for the most nominations with eight categories each. Neither disappointed: Alan Wake took home Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, and Best Game Direction, while BG3 won Best Multiplayer, Best Community Support, Best RPG, and the coveted Game of the Year. Voice actor Neil Newbon also received Best Performance for his portrayal of Astarion.




2023 was an excellent year for gaming, but if TGA 2023’s previews are to be believed, 2024 and 2025 have plenty lined up to rival it. The Game Awards 2023 provided plenty to be excited about - only time will tell what lives up to the hype.
