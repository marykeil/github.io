## Literature Review

The Memory Shard is a rare item you can find in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and use to locate a legendary location in the Underdark called the Adamantine Forge.





This means you will need to reach the Underdark in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Act 1. You can reach the Underdark by using a hidden door in the Shattered Sanctum after you get past the Ogre in the Defiled Temple. You will need to locate the Selunite Temple in the Underdark in order to get the Memory Shard.

You should start by looking for a drow named Dhourn, a member of a small party that is also looking for the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This group was petrified by a monstrous Spectator, a creature similar to a Beholder with laser-shooting eye stalks. The monster lurks near the Selunite Temple and attacks your party as you approach, freeing Dhourn from the stone under its control to be hostile toward your group.



If you sneak past the Spectator with one of your party members, you can free Dhourn early to fight by your side against the monster using Basilisk Oil or a spell like Greater Restoration.







                  All Adamantine Forge Items in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Ranked Worst To Best   Six different items can be crafted at the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and it&#39;s important to make the most of this exclusive opportunity.   

If you deal any damage to Dhourn, it will free him from the Spectator&#39;s control. However, the Dhourn will still fight your party unless your character is a Lolth-Sworn Drow, as they can de-escalate this fight. Whether you kill Dhourn or not, you will receive the Memory Shard after the end of the battle.



There will be no other opportunities to encounter this Drow in later Acts for you to collect the Shard at any other point in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

Once you gain the Shard, you can select the &#34;Use&#34; prompt when inspecting the item to activate a short cutscene that describes the mysterious item in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. You must pass an Arcana (Intelligence) related skill check to decipher images of the Forge and learn its location. If you killed Dourn earlier, you may cast Speak with Dead on his corpse to learn an optional password for the Shard that bypasses the need for the check.

Anyone traveling to a legendary Underdark spot can craft every Adamantine Forge item available, ranging from incredibly strong weapons to stalwart armor. When you find and use the Memory Shard in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, your party will also gain XP from the battle to gain the rare item.
