## Literature Review

In Lethal Company players are always in danger and there are no safe places to hide, so they should disable dangers like turrets when possible.





Like in the popular, multiplayer game Among Us, Lethal Company is a cooperative, online experience where friends get to team up to do tasks for the Company while trying not to die in the process. Unlike Among Us, no player is acting as the Imposter, so the entire party is working together. However, there is more to the Company than meets the eye and players will need to satisfy their demands if they wish to remain in one piece.

 Disabling Turrets in Lethal Company 
          

On the subject of turrets in Lethal Company, the first thing to know is that there is no way to permanently disable the turrets. And unlike turrets in Fortnite, these cannot be manipulated into being friendly. You will have to make your way back past them a second time or find a way around them. However, one of the best ways to disable them and find your way around the map is by having someone in the role of Operator.



There is no official &#34;role&#34; for Operator in Lethal Company compared to named operators in games like Modern Warfare 2, but it is a widely-used term for the role by players as described in the following paragraph.







The Operator is a term for the party member who stays in the ship and radios to the other players where to go and what’s on the computer map. They can guide players through tough obstacles or away from enemies, and this is considered a very important role to have in the game as they can also see loot on the map. One of the things they can see on the ship map is turrets, which can be disabled from the computer as well.

To disable them, type the name of the turret (ex. P1) in the computer commands, and it will disable the turret for just long enough for the party members near the turret to run past it to get the loot they need. Disabling it a second time will allow them to get back with the precious loot for the company. Remember, it is plenty of time for the players to run past the turret, but they also cannot dilly-dally and need to start moving once it&#39;s disabled.

If the party doesn’t have an Operator or the Operator has been lost, the party members can make their way past turrets a couple of different ways. Some turrets have a range that would allow players to sneak by without being detected, being sure to remain behind the turret while it is scanning. You can also hit the turret with a weapon, which will cause the turret to start shooting, but it will do so in a predictable manner that the players can follow behind to make it past.




Lastly, it is possible to sprint past in the seconds it takes to charge and shoot, but be sure there is cover on the other side before employing this method. This is a last resort and the most risky way to deal with turrets in the game. However, there may be no one else left to disable to the turrets in a round of Lethal Company, and sometimes it’s worth it to get back to the ship with what loot you have left.
