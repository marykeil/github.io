## Literature Review

Centurion may be the best DPS character in all of Reverse 1999. Her kit plays with her Moxie and decimates enemies with her Reality-based attacks.





Most of the time, Centurion only targets one or two enemies at a time. Outdoor Superstar is a two-person attack that bestows extra Moxie in the higher levels. Victorious General, meanwhile, is a single-enemy attack that gets a DMG bonus based on Centurion&#39;s available Moxie. All this extra Moxie contributes to her Ultimate, a mass attack that casts Weakness on all enemies left standing.




                  10 Best Gacha Games, According To Reddit   From Guardian Tales to Genshin Impact, gacha games are growing more popular by the minute, and Redditors share the best in the collection.     


 The Best Psychubes For Centurion 
         

As a main DPS, like damage dealers in Honkai: Star Rail, Centurion needs a Psychube that caters to her unique attacks. As Reverse 1999 expands its list of available Psychubes, keep an eye out for ones connected to defeating enemies, critical attacks, and general DMG bonuses.



As of the game&#39;s global launch, there are four Psychubes that turn Centurion into more of a brilliant, destructive force than she already is.




Thunderous Applause is an excellent choice for play styles centered around Victorious General. This Incantation, when fully upgraded, can deal more Reality DMG than Centurion&#39;s Ultimate, Reality Show Premier. If both Centurion and Thunderous Applause are fully upgraded, Centurion&#39;s Crit Rate will be at 25%. When she makes a critical hit with Victorious General while equipped with Thunderous Applause, she&#39;ll get up to a 32% Crit DMG bonus. Considering one of every four attacks with Victorious General is set to be critical, Thunderous Applause is truly that: thunderous.




If you want Centurion to have the last word with her Incantations in Reverse 1999, try Hopscotch. Hopscotch provides up to an 18% Incantation bonus, making it more likely she&#39;ll be the one to kill the enemies in a given round of combat. When she does, she&#39;ll get an 8% Ultimate Might bonus. This bonus can stack four times, bringing Reality Show Premier to the same lethality as Victorious General.

If you haven&#39;t gotten Centurion to Insight 3, which unlocks her self-heal passive, His Bounden Duty may be the Psychube for you. To start, it has up to a 12% general DMG bonus, supporting Centurion in all her efforts. This Psychube has another enemy defeat trigger, similar to Hopscotch. Rather than providing a DMG bonus, it allows the carrier to heal by up to 120% of their ATK. If you want to challenge yourself and send Centurion into combat alone, give her this Psychube.

Do you not own any of these excellent 6-Star Psychubes in Reverse 1999? Don&#39;t worry; Centurion has a great 5-Star option, too, called An Afternoon Nap. This cozy-sounding Psychube acts like a lesser version of Thunderous Applause. It has a 13% Crit Rate bonus and another Amplification centered around single-target attacks. Here, once Centurion uses Victorious General, she gets a 3% Crit DMG bonus.






When fully leveled up, this bonus can stack eight times. Although Thunderous Applause is better, this is still an awesome Psychube for a fantastic character.






 The Best Team Comps For Centurion 
         

Centurion can head up a wide range of team comps, but if you want to find characters that synergize well with her kit, keep an eye out for debuffers to keep the enemies weak, easy targets. Centurion is such a strong fighter that she doesn&#39;t necessarily need a buffer; her Psychubes do a buffer&#39;s job for them.

Bkormblume is one of the best debuffers Reverse 1999 has to offer as of launch, so long as she&#39;s paired with a Reality DMG team. Her debuffs weaken the enemies to Reality DMG (the same type Centurion deals) and can deal extra DMG when her enemies have lowered stats or similar negative conditions. She supports Centurion&#39;s attacks while, at the same time, acting as a solid sub-DPS herself. Her Ultimate deals a stronger percentage of Reality DMG than Centurion&#39;s Ultimate, further adding to their synergy.




If you want both debuffs and buffs, bring Voyager along. This humble violinist has an excellent Counter Incantation that strengthens her allies&#39; subsequent attacks and reduces DMG Taken when an enemy next tries to hit them. Meanwhile, once you level up Stellar Symphony, Voyager both hurts all enemies and applies Confusion, which makes them weaker to critical attacks. If Centurion has Thunderous Applause or An Afternoon Nap, Voyager&#39;s debuff is perfect for her.

When it comes to healers in Reverse 1999, Medicine Pocket is the go-to option for the best team comps in Reverse 1999. Much like with DPS characters in Genshin Impact, if Centurion is the best main DPS, Medicine Pocket is the best survival character. When Medicine Pocket heals the team, they give them all a stack of Sturdiness, reducing their next round of DMG Taken. Meanwhile, they also act as a second debuffer. They increase the DMG Taken by whoever they target with Inherent Habit for one round. This gives Centurion an excellent chance to slip in and cause chaos.




Balloon Party is another healer that pairs well with Centurion, healing based on a percentage of Lost HP. Just as she heals her allies, she also provides a variety of statuses. She can reduce DMG Taken and then heal her allies following their injury. Her healing capabilities aren&#39;t as great as Medicine Pocket&#39;s, but since Centurion has her healing abilities, you want a healer who can do more than heal. Ergo, the Balloon Party is a useful addition to the team.

If you were lucky enough to get Centurion but not any of her best team members, don&#39;t worry. Sonetto is a F2P character but still one of the best support characters in Reverse 1999. She debuffs enemies, buffs her allies, and does her fair share of damage to back up Centurion&#39;s attacks. Sonetto&#39;s another character who fits into most team comps because of how well she&#39;s built. Since Centurion can heal herself with Insight 3, you may be able to get through a fight with just Centurion and Sonetto.

Whatever characters you have, if you have Centurion on your side, Reverse 1999 will be a cakewalk for you.
