## Literature Review

Fighting The Reaper in a Persona game has always been a great challenge for players and Royal is no exception. Here&#39;s the lowdown on P5R&#39;s Reaper.





In the original Persona 5, the best time to run into the Reaper was during the Flu Season in Japan. With the rules of the Metaverse, if people are feeling down or sick in the real world, the enemies in the Metaverse are as well, and The Reaper would fall within three turns. This method, however, was removed in Persona 5 Royal.

 How To Spawn &amp; Beat The Reaper In Persona 5 Royal 
          

To make the Reapwer spawn, you must first enter Mementos. If you stand still and do not explore the different Mementos, the Repear will eventually spawn and apprehend your party. You will start hearing chains rattling, which is a quick way to know that the Reaper is nearby. Once you hear the chains rattling, the Reaper is somewhere on the same floor,, and you can find the boss by simply exploring.



Be warned, this is one of the hardest fights in the game now that the flu season trick is no longer available.




Before stepping into this fight, it is recommended to be at least level 60 at this point in Persona 5 Royal and have maxed-out confidants for the active party members for this fight. Also, ensure that you equip the best weapons and armor at this point in the game.






Make sure whoever your designated healer has the spell Mediarahan as this move fully restores the HP of every party member on the team.




There is a chance you will get the Divine Pillar as a drop when you start fighting The Reaper. This item is particularly handy as it halved all damage taken for the entire team, making it one of the best defensive items to have in Personal 5 Royal. Also, ensure you equip the Null Repel, Curse, Light, and Drain moves.

When the battle begins, cast Makarakarn, as this move traps the Reaper in a cycle of focusing and casting Megidolaon. As the Reaper begins to focus, either Guard or sets up accuracy buffs. The main play here is to chip down the Reaper&#39;s damage little by little when he is charging an attack and using the healer&#39;s best abilities when a team member gets knocked down. Keep attacking it until the Reaper is defeated.

Ultimately, you will be rewarded with the &#34;A Unique Rebel&#34; trophy and a large chunk of experience for your team. This may take a few tries to defeat, but it is well worth the effort to find and defeat Persona 5&#39;s Reaper.
