# Baldur s Gate 3 Finally Makes One Beloved Character Canon (But It s Easy To Miss)


## SUMMARY 



  Patch 5 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 added a number of new features, but the most significant is a playable epilogue.   Certain permutations of the epilogue have also canonized a character made popular by BG3&#39;s cast participating in a one-shot Dungeons &amp; Dragons game as their characters.   Bing Bong, an imp that works at a fantasy supermarket, is now canon in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

## Literature Review

A tiny NPC from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons one-shot with the Baldur’s Gate 3 cast has now joined the game’s canon in the most unexpected but wonderful way.




Larian Studios&#39; latest patch for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 was a big one, full of bug fixes, new clothes, and, most importantly, a playable epilogue. While the majority of this conclusion is defined by the choices players have made throughout their adventure, there was one tiny addition that everyone will get to enjoy. In an easily missed line of new dialogue, one fan favorite character was officially made part of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 canon.




Patch 5 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 added some much-needed bug fixes, as well as tweaking some of the combat to provide better balance. One of the largest additions was a new game mode for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 called Honour Mode, designed for an extra challenge as it only allows one save file. However, among all the fixes and gameplay additions, one aspect firmly caught the fanbase’s attention.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Bing Bong The Imp Has Joined Baldur’s Gate 3 Canon 
          

Back in September 2023, the UK based Dungeons &amp; Dragons YouTube channel High Rollers hosted the cast of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for a one-shot set during the events of the game. The two episodes saw the cast play as their BG3 Origin characters as Dungeon Master Mark Hulmes took them on a journey to save Tav. However, there was one NPC that viewers and the cast immediately latched onto, an imp named Bing Bong, who has now joined BG3 canon.






 Who Is Bing Bong In Baldur’s Gate 3? 
         

In High Rollers Presents: Shadows of Athkatla, the cast of BG3 joins Dungeon Master Mark Hulmes on a journey to save Tav from a mysterious spell. Hulmes does a fantastic job of integrating part of BG3 gameplay into the DnD game, often in humorous ways, such as describing that Tav has been hoarding books and cups in their bag. The premise of why the Origin characters are on this adventure and removing the player character Tav from the story are also very clever.

As the story unfolds, the party eventually find themselves in the city of Athkatla searching for answers. After deciding to split up, Lae&#39;zel and Shadowheart end up at a store called the Adventurer&#39;s Mart, described as a fantasy supermarket. Outside was a little imp in a hat and bow tie who slides the door open for customers while shouting &#34;Bing Bong!&#34; 





 

The cast and the audience were instantly in love with the little fiend, but no one more so than Jennifer English playing as Shadowheart. Immediately calling him a &#34;darling, sweet imp,&#34; English adopted Bing Bong into their group as they continued to search for clues. Bing Bong wasn&#39;t the greatest amount of help, as he didn&#39;t speak much Common beyond &#34;bing bong&#34; but that didn&#39;t stop anyone from adoring him as the one-shot continued to its second episode.



The only Common Bing Bong ever spoke was &#34;No com-men, only bing bong.&#34;




In the few days between the two episodes, fan art of Bing Bong had exploded and there were already calls for Shadowheart&#39;s tiny new friend to be added to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Even Larian Studios joined in the fun with a post on X (formerly Twitter), saying, &#34;we&#39;re still thinking about Bing Bong.&#34; Sadly, Bing Bong did not live to see the end of the High Rollers&#39; second episode.





 

Bing Bong met his end at the hands of Devora Wilde playing Lae&#39;zel as she set him on fire and threw him towards the enemy. With only a few hit points Bing Bong hit the ground and perished, but his legacy continued long after the game had ended. Mods appeared shortly after the second episode aired, giving players the ability to add Bing Bong into Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 such as MaestroMetty&#39;s Bing Bong Summon on NexusMods.



 How Bing Bong Joins Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

The impact Bing Bong had on the BG3 community was big enough that Larian has now added him to the game – sort of. During the new epilogue set after the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the party reunites six months after the battle with the Netherbrain to catch up and swap stories with each other. It is during a chat with Shadowheart that a familiar name can be heard as she discusses with the player character what to talk to people about.






That stray imp that joined us - Bing Bong, wasn&#39;t it?




However, this line might be missed by some, as it appears that only a romanced Shadowheart who turned her back on Shar has this dialogue. The way Shadowheart talks about Bing Bong in BG3 suggests that the events of the High Rollers one-shot are not canon. Instead of explaining to Tav (or perhaps the Dark Urge) who Bing Bong is, Shadowheart&#39;s line suggests that she and Tav were the only ones to meet the tiny fiend.

As she says that she and Tav have squeezed a lot into the last six months, Shadowheart mentions Bing Bong alongside Sharran assassins and other adventures they have shared after the events of BG3. In this context, it seems that this version of Bing Bong is not the same one that was seen in Shadows of Athkatla. Whether it is a different imp, also named Bing Bong, or an alternative version of the fan favorite isn&#39;t clear, but just knowing Shadowheart has met him will be enough for some.




Bing Bong&#39;s inclusion in BG3, even in such a small way, speaks to Larian&#39;s dedication to listening to its players. This goes in some way to explain why Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 was nominated in eight categories for The Game Awards 2023. Bing Bong joining canon and the epilogue as a whole is yet another example of Larian respecting players&#39; choices and agency.

The continued patches, hot fixes, and updates that BG3 receives are setting new standards for the gaming industry at large. From giving players the option to remove multiplayer companions to allowing customization after character creation, Larian continues to respond to the feedback given. Best of all, this is all for free, as Larian Studios has made it clear on numerous occasions that it will never implement microtransactions.

Patch 5&#39;s epilogue is a great example of a game&#39;s developer getting it right. Bing Bong joining canon is only one line in a packed epilogue that gives closure to many of the events of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. But it is enough for many to know that Bing Bong is out there in some form in the Forgotten Realms.
