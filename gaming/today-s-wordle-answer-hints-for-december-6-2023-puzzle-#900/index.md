For those that prefer a challenge though there are Wordle-alternatives like Quordle or Squabble, which turns the game into a battle royale against other players. These copycats can be a great addition to your normal Wordle routine, and add a little flavor to the otherwise basic gameplay.

The December 6th Wordle answer is WOMAN.

For our starting Wordle word today we went with IRATE which provided a few incorrect letters and a single misplaced vowel. Moving it around a bit we tried GALOP for our second attempt, this added another incorrect spot for the &#39;A&#39; and a new incorrectly placed &#39;O&#39;.

Our third guess was NOMAND which really opened up the game giving us the correct locations for &#39;O&#39;, &#39;M&#39;, and &#39;A&#39;. The &#39;N&#39; was in the wrong spot but there was only one possible location for it to fit. This quickly led us to our Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer, and 900th Wordle word, WOMAN.
