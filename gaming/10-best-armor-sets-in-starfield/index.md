## Literature Review

The best armor sets in Starfield feature unique stats, sentimental value, and environmental resistance, which is viable for all kinds of gameplay.





Armor sets in Starfield generally come in three pieces: a Helmet, Spacesuit and one of several different types of Boost Pack. These pieces all have different defensive stats: Physical, Energy and EM Damage Resistance, and Thermal, Corrosive, Radiation and Airborne Environmental Resistance. Essentially, these stats tell you how well your spacesuit resists damage from weapons and the environment. When it comes to deep space exploration, the best armor sets have a good mix of both.









 








 10  Monster Costume 
Starfield&#39;s Best Armor Set For Undeniable Comic Value
        

  Stats    PHYS Damage Resistance   50    ENGY Damage Resistance   50    EM Damage Resistance   50    Thermal Environmental Resistance   0    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   0    Airborne Environmental Resistance   0    Radiation Environmental Resistance   0    
How To Obtain: Complete Tourists Go Home at New Homestead&#39;s Living History Colony on Titan (Sol System)
The Monster Costume isn&#39;t exactly stellar, but it&#39;s easily the silliest and quite possibly one of the most stylish armor sets in Starfield. You receive this costume by helping out Dr. Giuliana Lakota of the Living History Colony on Titan with a small but hilarious side quest. The good doctor is rather tired of tourists, and enlists your help in scaring them off while disguised as a gigantic tardigrade. Scare off enough tourists, and you&#39;ll get the Monster Costume as a quest reward.
One quick look at the stats will tell you that it&#39;s nothing special. The costume&#39;s damage resistance is minimal, and it has absolutely no environmental resistance to speak of. As such, it&#39;s best thought of as a futuristic update of the inflatable T-Rex costume: poor in battle, but extraordinarily high-quality comic relief. 





 9  UC Vanguard Spacesuit 
A Well-Rounded Armor Set For Early-Game Grunt Work
        

  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   64   34   32    ENGY Damage Resistance   68   36   34    EM Damage Resistance   72   38   36    Thermal Environmental Resistance   15   5   5    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   0   0   0    Airborne Environmental Resistance   30   20   20    Radiation Environmental Resistance   15   5   5    
How To Obtain: Complete Grunt Work (Faction mission for the United Colonies Vanguard)
The UC Vanguard Spacesuit armor set is a few steps above the basic Deep Mining Spacesuit you receive in Starfield&#39;s opening chapter. To get it, you have to sign up to the United Colonies Vanguard: the UC&#39;s fleet of volunteers and captains-for-hire. The rewards for your first mission include the UC Vanguard Spacesuit, the UC Vanguard Space Helmet and the UC Vanguard Pilot Pack.
It&#39;s a solid, well-rounded armor set for the early game, with a good balance of defensive stats. The set&#39;s physical, energy and EM damage resistance will keep you alive as you work to protect and save the United Colonies. However, it&#39;s highly recommended that you avoid any corrosive gas vents while out exploring new worlds, as the set totally lacks any resistance to corrosive damage.





 8  Gran-Gran&#39;s Spacesuit 
A Nice Armor Set From Your Parents
        

  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   76   26   -    ENGY Damage Resistance   60   42   -    EM Damage Resistance   68   34   -    Thermal Environmental Resistance   35   20   -    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   20   15   -    Airborne Environmental Resistance   10   5   -    Radiation Environmental Resistance   15   10   -    
How To Obtain: Pick the Kid Stuff Trait during character creation, and visit your parents in New Atlantis three times.
The Kid Stuff Trait is one of the best Traits in Starfield. If chosen during character creation, your parents will still be alive and well, and you can even pay them a visit. They&#39;ll often send you big gifts, including your high-school backpack (for additional carrying capacity), Sir Livingstone&#39;s Pistol and even the unique Wanderwell ship, available nowhere else in the game.
In return, you&#39;ll send them 2% of your credits every week automatically, although this is capped. 

One of the best gifts your parents have to offer is Gran-Gran&#39;s Spacesuit, which also comes with Gran-Gran&#39;s Helmet as part of a two-piece armor set. It turns out that your grandmother served in the UC Marines, and now it&#39;s up to you to make the most of her unique armor. Overall, the set has excellent defensive stats for Starfield&#39;s early and mid-game portions, and with the right skills, you can upgrade it even further.
You will have to clip on a Boost Pack from another armor set. 

Finally, as a nice bonus, Gran-Gran&#39;s Spacesuit also comes with the Pocketed mod, which increases your carrying capacity.





 7  Ranger Spacesuit 
The Perfect Armor Set For A Freestar Ranger
        

  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   96   44   48    ENGY Damage Resistance   64   36   32    EM Damage Resistance   80   40   40    Thermal Environmental Resistance   30   5   5    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   20   20   20    Airborne Environmental Resistance   10   5   0    Radiation Environmental Resistance   0   0   5    
How To Obtain: Join the Freestar Rangers and complete The Hammer Falls (final mission for the Freestar Collective faction)
The Freestar Rangers are wandering lawmen and women tasked with maintaining safety and security in Freestar Collective space. They&#39;re a ragtag bunch, and you can join their faction to uncover a sinister conspiracy with far-reaching implications for the Collective. Once you&#39;ve completed your investigation, the Rangers will more than hold up their end of the bargain, gifting you Starfield&#39;s Star Eagle spaceship and the Ranger Spacesuit set.
The Ranger Spacesuit is plain and rugged, with none of the fancy add-ons that other armor sets have. It&#39;s no-nonsense, with excellent defensive stats across the board. In short, it&#39;s perfect for anyone looking to enforce the law in the farthest reaches of Freestar Collective space. The high damage resistance ensures that you&#39;ll be able to shrug off most weapons fire, and you&#39;ve also got decent resistance to environmental damage.





 6  UC Antixeno Spacesuit 
A Sturdy Armor Set For Hunting Aliens
        

  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   76   44   44    ENGY Damage Resistance   92   42   42    EM Damage Resistance   84   46   46    Thermal Environmental Resistance   0   10   10    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   10   0   0    Airborne Environmental Resistance   30   0   0    Radiation Environmental Resistance   20   20   20    
How To Obtain: Complete Hostile Intelligence (eighth Faction mission for the United Colonies)
The UC Antixeno Spacesuit set is essentially a mid-game upgrade to the UC Vanguard Spacesuit set. Unlike some of Starfield&#39;s armor sets, the UC Antixeno Spacesuit also excels against one specific enemy type: alien wildlife. Both the Spacesuit and the Helmet can come with the Beast Hunter Perk, which reduces the damage you take from aliens by 15%. It also comes with the Analyzer (10% extra damage against scanned targets) and Incendiary (10% chance to ignite attackers) perks.
Coupled with a combat-focused Starfield character background, you&#39;ll be the bane of any hostile alien lifeforms. By scanning hostile animals when you encounter them, you can guarantee that you&#39;ll receive the 10% damage bonus, and any enemy that gets within melee range might spontaneously catch fire when attacking you. It&#39;s a tough set of armor, perfect for exploring and setting up new outposts on dangerous new planets.





 5  Bounty Hunter Spacesuit 
A Well-Rounded Armor Set For Explorers
        

  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   128   72   -    ENGY Damage Resistance   132   56   -    EM Damage Resistance   136   64   -    Thermal Environmental Resistance   15   20   -    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   15   0   -    Airborne Environmental Resistance   15   0   -    Radiation Environmental Resistance   15   10   -    
How To Obtain: Loot from dead Spacers in the Mantis&#39; Lair, or purchase from Zuri&#39;s Essentials at the Key (available if you join or infiltrate the Crimson Fleet for UC SysDef)
The Bounty Hunter Spacesuit set is one of the best armor sets for the mid to late-game, thanks to its all-round solid stats. By equipping this set, you&#39;ll have broad resistance to all types of damage, and a well-balanced set of environmental resistances. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t come with any special perks, but it&#39;s flexible and easily upgraded if you have the right skills. There are other, more unusual armor sets out there, but the Bounty Hunter set is durable and reliable in a pitched firefight.
There are also several different Bounty Hunter Boost Packs you can equip, but their stats will all differ slightly, so make sure to compare to find the best variant for your build.





 4  Mercury Spacesuit 
The Best Armor Set For Fans Of Old-School Sci-Fi


 







  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   108   50   42    ENGY Damage Resistance   92   52   58    EM Damage Resistance   100   54   50    Thermal Environmental Resistance   25   15   20    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   25   15   20    Airborne Environmental Resistance   25   15   20    Radiation Environmental Resistance   25   15   20    
How To Obtain: Pick up during the Unearthed main mission.
The Mercury Spacesuit set is a nice throwback to the early days of space exploration, and is essentially a faithful recreation of space suits once used by NASA. In-game, the armor set has stats to match the Bounty Hunter Spacesuit set, but also boasts additional environmental resistance. It&#39;s the perfect choice for explorers and outpost builders who benefit most from resistance to a wide variety of environmental hazards.
However, although the set comes with the Mercury Pack, you&#39;ll have to swap in a different pack to get Boost Pack functionality. The Mercury Pack has some potent stats, but isn&#39;t actually a boost pack, so you&#39;ll need to decide whether you&#39;d like some additional armor or extra mobility.
Unlike other armor sets, the Mercury Spacesuit set can be missed, as the area it&#39;s found in becomes inaccessible after your mission is complete. Make sure to grab it from the display cases before progressing. 






 3  Mantis Armor 
The Perfect Armor Set For Settled Systems Vigilantes
        

  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   116   54   47    ENGY Damage Resistance   84   46   55    EM Damage Resistance   100   50   51    Thermal Environmental Resistance   15   20   5    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   0   10   0    Airborne Environmental Resistance   30   0   5    Radiation Environmental Resistance   15   0   20    
How To Obtain: Complete Starfield&#39;s The Mantis side quest
While exploring, you might come across a mysterious data slate named Secret Outpost! which starts a new side quest. By following the quest log, you&#39;ll end up at a hidden base on Denebola 1-B. As you explore, you&#39;ll discover that the base was once the lair of the Mantis: a notorious vigilante whose presence struck fear into the hearts of pirates and raiders across the Settled Systems.
By completing the quest, you can claim the mantle of the Mantis for yourself. The rewards include the Razorleaf, one of Starfield&#39;s best ships, and the Mantis Armor set. Aside from its stats, the Mantis Armor set also comes with extra perks, selected at random from a large list of possible perks. You can re-roll which perks you get by reloading saves, giving this armor set an extra layer of customisability that other armor sets don&#39;t have.





 2  Mark 1 Constellation Spacesuit 
The Best Armor Set For Dedicated Explorers


 







  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   132   72   66    ENGY Damage Resistance   136   64   64    EM Damage Resistance   128   68   68    Thermal Environmental Resistance   20   20   20    Corrosive Environmental Resistance   30   5   5    Airborne Environmental Resistance   0   5   5    Radiation Environmental Resistance   10   0   0    
How To Obtain: Grab from the display case in the basement of the Lodge.
The Mark 1 Constellation Spacesuit boasts impressive late-game stats, but you can actually obtain this special armor set early thanks to an exploit. You&#39;ll reach Constellation&#39;s Lodge within the first hour of the game, and can access the basement from any point afterward. The Mark 1 Constellation set is stored away inside a display case with a Master-level lock.
However, with a bit of careful movement, you can grab the suit and obtain one of the game&#39;s best late-game armor sets very early on. Its stats make it ideal for prolonged firefights and also outclasses many other armor sets when it comes to environmental resistance. The Mark 1 Constellation set should last you a long time, but you can always upgrade it as you reach Starfield&#39;s highest levels.





 1  Starborn Spacesuit 
The Best Armor Set In Starfield


 







  Stats      Spacesuit   Helmet   Pack    PHYS Damage Resistance   Depends on which variant you obtain    ENGY Damage Resistance    EM Damage Resistance    Thermal Environmental Resistance    Corrosive Environmental Resistance    Airborne Environmental Resistance    Radiation Environmental Resistance    
How To Obtain: Reach Starfield&#39;s New Game Plus
Once you reach New Game Plus, you&#39;ll receive the Starborn Spacesuit. This is easily the best armor set in the game, and you can upgrade its stats even further by reaching New Game Plus more than once. The best version is the Starborn Spacesuit Venator set, obtained by reaching your tenth New Game Plus playthrough.
This is quite the journey, even for dedicated Starfield players. In the meantime, make sure to track down some of the armor sets listed above. The Settled Systems can be dangerous for the unprepared, and having the right armor might just save your life.
