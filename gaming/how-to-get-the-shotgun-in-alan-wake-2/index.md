## Literature Review

Finding the shotgun in Alan Wake 2 will make a difference for the difficult boss fights throughout the game, and luckily, players can find one early.





There are two different storylines that line up with the two main characters. Players can choose which storyline they follow first at different places in the narrative, although the game will make that decision for you at times. That being said, both protagonists will need all the weapons they can get to survive their journey throughout the game.




                  &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review   Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedy’s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.    


 How To Find Both Shotguns In Alan Wake 2 
          

The first shotgun is available to Saga early in Alan Wake 2, during Chapter 2 when she can visit the General Store. There’s a locked door near the back, and a cultist will burst into the room that Saga must defeat before proceeding. After that, inspecting the back room will reveal a locked cabinet that needs a combination to open on the right wall.



The cultist can be hard to beat, so give yourself plenty of room and backup if needed. It will take a fair amount of ammo to defeat the cultist.







There is a note near the cabinet informing Saga that Lady Fortuna has the combination to the lock at the front desk, so you will then need to return to the front desk and look for a notebook. There is a notebook and a lottery ticket, which will be used to solve the combination lock. There are a series of numbers on the lottery ticket and several crossed-out combinations on the notepad.



If you inspect both sets of numbers, it is clear that the crossed-out combinations are the same as the first four numbers on the ticket, with a “7” added to the beginning of them.




The next number on the ticket is 39, so add a 7 in front of it, and you will have the combination for the lock, which is 739. Return to the cabinet and enter the number so that it reads from top to bottom, and you will get the shotgun, but remember that it has very limited ammo at the beginning, so consider saving this weapon in Alan Wake 2 for the next boss fight.

Alan cannot get a shotgun until later in the main story, but it will be near the main path. During the Room 665 chapter, find the rooftop bar of the Oceanview Hotel to get the shotgun. You will have to use the Angel Lamp to open the door, and once inside, you should note the drink menu before turning the light off and taking the shotgun and any other supplies inside. Leave via the Angel Lamp with everything you can, as you will not be coming by this bar again in Alan Wake 2.
