# One Highly-Overlooked BG3 Trick Will Make Cutscenes Way Less Awkward


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 cutscenes can be awkward when characters are covered in blood, after just finishing a battle.   Patch 4 of the game introduced the feature of using soaps and sponges to clean blood and dirt.   While cleanliness doesn&#39;t have in-game consequences, it&#39;s nice to have the option for better presentation during cutscenes.

## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 characters don&#39;t always look their best in cutscenes, but it&#39;s actually exceptionally easy to address a common cause of complaint.




Baldur’s Gate 3 cutscenes don’t always play out in ways that are necessarily ideal, but there’s one easy technique that can help make characters look more presentable at virtually any point in the game. Unlike the first two games in the Baldur’s Gate series and many similar RPG competitors, Baldur’s Gate 3 features extensive voice acting and motion capture to bring conversations to life. This can provide enormous benefits to overall immersion, but it also provides plenty of opportunities for minor things to become distracting.




Some silliness in cutscenes tends to be fully the player’s responsibility, like dressing companions in goofy attire or putting on clown makeup in the circus in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Act 3. Other things, however, can be a natural consequence of any campaign. One oddity that tends to crop up particularly often in conversations is the copious amount of blood or muck that the party can end up coated in after melee combat. This feature can help the game feel tactile, as adventurers wouldn’t be particularly likely to walk away from every encounter in clean condition, but it can feel weird when it’s not acknowledged in certain serious situations.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3: Act 1 Checklist (Everything You Don’t Want To Miss)   Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3 has much to see, like recruitable characters, hidden bosses, and other secrets that might require a checklist.   


 Water Can Be Used To Clean Characters In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          




It’s actually exceptionally easy to address the grime on a party in Baldur’s Gate 3, as any amount of water can make it easy to clean a character from head to toe. Although standing in shallow water will do the trick, the most straightforward methods are to toss any container of water or use create or destroy water. As an essential Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Level 1 spell, create or destroy water can waste a spell slot for a purely cosmetic effect, but using it after a difficult encounter can fix things up quickly for cutscenes.



 Water Isn’t The Only Way To Clean Up In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

Another significant alternative was added to Baldur’s Gate 3 in Patch 4, a major November 2023 update that came with hundreds of fixes and adjustments to the game. One change made soaps and sponges, previously useless items outside of minor monetary value, work the same magic that water does on blood and dirt. Although this wasn’t a pressing issue, it’s always nice to have proper utility for inventory clutter in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, even if the fact that ropes still can’t be deployed outside of weight for pressure traps is a bit of a bummer.




There’s ultimately nothing wrong with leaving characters as they are after Baldur’s Gate 3 combat, as any concerns about sanitation don’t have in-game consequences. All the same, it’s nice to have the option when it comes to presentation, and it’s neat that the solution is accessible through in-game mechanics rather than a button to click. Baldur’s Gate 3 characters might get dirty with exceptional ease, but with a little splash of water or a dab of soap, they’ll be looking clean and fresh once again.
