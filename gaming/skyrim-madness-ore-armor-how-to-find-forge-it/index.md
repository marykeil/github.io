## Literature Review

Skyrim&#39;s Madness Ore has been adjusted in the Saints and Seducers DLC, and now players can use it to craft their own Madness Armor (eventually).





Madness Ore is quite rare and sometimes spawns in the boss chest of a dungeon. However, there is an easier way to get the Madness Ore. You can trade for the resource with the traveling Khajiit merchants. The ability to purchase the Madness Ore becomes available once you complete the two main quests of Saints and Seducers, &#34;Balance of Power&#34; and &#34;Restoring Order.&#34;

 Skyrim Madness Ore Quests 
          

Once you complete the Saints and Seducers questline, you will be approached by a courier who will give a message: &#34;Note on New Wares.&#34; The letter is from Ri&#39;saad, and he will say that he now has exotic new goods for sale. Once you have read the letter, you will not be able to purchase Madness Ore from the two traveling Khajiit merchants. Ri&#39;saad is a member of the Khajiit Caravan in Skyrim who can be found between Whiterun and Markarth. The other caravan merchant, Ahkari, can be found on paths between Dawnstar and Riften.

Unfortunately, even once you get Madness Ore in Skyrim, you can&#39;t use it right away, as you will still require the proper knowledge to craft it into Madness armor. After defeating Thoron during Saints and Seducers&#39; &#34;Restoring Order&#34; quest, you will find a note called &#34;Note on Amber and Madness Ore.&#34; This clue will lead you to a Miscellaneous Quest to Mistwatch, a bandit fort located north of the border of the Rift and Eastmarch. Check out that location in this video from Gwerfaur on YouTube below:





 

At Mistwatch, you will encounter Evethra, an arcane blacksmith who has the information needed to learn about using Skyrim&#39;s Madness Ore. After slaying her and her skeleton minions; players can loot and read her journal to learn the secrets of Amber and Madness armor-smithing. Once this journal has been read, you can begin crafting Madness armor and weapons.



 Skyrim&#39;s Madness Armor &amp; Weapon Crafting 
          

To forge Skyrim&#39;s Madness armor and weapons, you will also need to gather Leather Strips and Ebony Ingots. There are multiple locations in Skyrim in which players can find Ebony Ore, but the best place to farm Ebony is in Gloombound Mine, located inside the Orc stronghold of Narzulbur in Eastmarch. Leather is made from animal hides, which can be found pretty much anywhere in Skyrim and can be turned into leather strips at tanning stations.






Don&#39;t forget to use one of Skyrim&#39;s Fortfy Smithing potions to make your Madness armor creations even better!




By the time players reach the point where they know how to use Madness Ore to craft Madness armor, it&#39;s likely they will have a stockpile of both leather strips and Ebony. To craft every piece of Madness armor in Skyrim, you will need a total of 17 Madness Ingots, 7 Ebony Ingots, and 10 strips of leather. Below is every Madness Weapon and every piece of Madness Armor Skyrim players can craft:

 Madness Armors  Madness Weapons   Madness Armor  Madness Arrow   Madness Boots  Madness Battleaxe   Madness Gauntlets  Madness Bow   Madness Helmet  Madness Dagger   Madness Shield  Madness Greatsword     Madness Mace     Madness Sword     Madness War Axe     Madness Warhammer   






Melee builds should note that while Madness Gauntlets are stronger than regular Heavy Armor in Skyrim, they are not compatible with the &#34;Fists of Steel&#34; perk. Depending on the combination of armor players are wearing, it might be better overall to forego the Madness Gauntlets and use another form of Heavy Armor in order to retain the damage bonus.
