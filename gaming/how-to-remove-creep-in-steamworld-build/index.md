## Literature Review

Removing Creep in SteamWorld Build is an essential process and one players must take care of quickly so they can keep building unobstructed.





This game fits neatly into the same universe that all the SteamWorld franchise games fall into, but this game focuses on the management side of gameplay. Players will need to create a supply chain and grow the population while at the same time digging deep into the earth to find rocket ship pieces. Digging underground will be dangerous but provides numerous resources, so Creep must be dealt with as soon as possible.




                  &#34;Intriguingly Charming&#34;: SteamWorld Build Review   SteamWorld Build brings the long-running franchise into the world of city management, largely succeeding in creating engaging management systems.   


 How To Get Rid Of Creep in SteamWorld Build 
          

Another factor to consider is that once Creep has been seen, it will continue to grow and overtake anything that isnâ€™t fertile ground or obstructed by something else. To get rid of it, you will need to have Guard Robots, which will likely be unlocked by the time you come across Creep plants. However, if not, build the Guard Quarters as soon as possible to catch up on the right kind of robots for the job.

Like Henchmen in Evil Genius 2, the Guard Robots can immediately take care of the Creep when given the right tools. In this case, they will need a flamethrower. You may already have one, but the best place to find them is within chests hidden on this floor or others. Once you have one, equip it to the Guard Quarters by modifying them, and the Guard Robots will immediately get to work burning Creep away.






Equipping more than one of each item to the Guard Quarters is possible, so you can equip multiple flamethrowers to deal with Creep faster.




Once you move to other floors, you can move the flamethrowers around to ensure that each floor has at least one Guard Robot equipped with a flamethrower. Additionally, the Robot carrying the flamethrower will also use it to eliminate enemies it comes across. As in the mining system in Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you will only be digging deeper to achieve your goals, so being prepared to counter any creep in your adventures will keep you ready for anything in SteamWorld Build.
