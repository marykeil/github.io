# Do This First In Indigo Disk DLC If You Want A New Pokémon ASAP


## SUMMARY 



  The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet introduces new monsters and evolutions, with open-world exploration allowing trainers to complete tasks in any order they choose.   The main story of the DLC focuses on battling the Elite Four and their Champion, Kieran, who has become stronger since the previous installment.   Despite the game implying that Drayton should be fought last, it is recommended to fight him first to obtain the TM &#34;Dragon Cheer&#34; and evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple, making it easier to obtain a new Pokémon early on in the DLC.

## Literature Review

There are several new Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but getting Hydrapple can be a lot easier if one fight is completed first.




The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet includes several new monsters, including four new Paradox Pokémon and new evolutions for Dipplin and Duraludon. Once the DLC is started, players are given access to the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. This is where most of the DLC takes place, and because it once again features open-world exploration, this means the order certain story beats can take place is totally left up to the order trainers want to complete tasks. However, for those wanting to a get a new Pokémon like Hyrdapple as soon as possible, there&#39;s one task that should be taken on as soon as it&#39;s available.




The main story of The Indigo Disk involves the BB League Elite Four and their Champion, Kieran, who&#39;s gotten a lot stronger since The Teal Mask. There&#39;s a big emphasis on battling, and depending on how much exploration is done first in the Terarium&#39;s four biomes, trainers will unlock the Elite Four battles very early on. Once this happens, each member of the Elite Four will scatter to one of those four biomes and the order in which they can be fought is totally up to the player.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 You Should Fight Drayton First In Pokémon&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC 
          

It might sound strange, but Drayton should be fought first in Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. The game clearly means for Drayton to be last: Found in the snowy biome, he&#39;s farthest away from the entrance of the Terarium; his Dragon-type team can make for a tough fight; and within the narrative, he&#39;s got the leadership role despite not being the actual Champion. However, Drayton will reward trainers who defeat him with the new TM &#34;Dragon Cheer,&#34; which is why he should be the first BB League Elite Four member to beat, even if it&#39;s a bit of a hassle.






 Use &#34;Dragon Cheer&#34; To Evolve Dipplin Into Hydrapple 
          

The TM &#34;Dragon Cheer&#34; is an important one because this is how to evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple. It&#39;s also likely the easiest and fastest way to get one of the new Pokémon from Indigo Disk, since the Paradox Pokémon are in postgame and evolving Duraludon into Archaludon requires Metal Alloy, which can be purchased for 300 BP at the Blueberry Academy Store. Farming BP isn&#39;t bad, but it will probably take longer to farm 300 BP than it will to simply go and fight Drayton.

Drayton can be an admittedly tough fight, but getting &#34;Dragon Cheer&#34; and evolving Dipplin into Hydrapple makes it well worth that early effort. Lower-level teams (or teams that are weak to Dragon-types) may need to spend some time swapping teams or buffing up their Pokémon. In this case, it&#39;s easier to farm 300 BP for Achaludon instead. Either way, this means one new Pokémon can be recruited fairly early on in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
