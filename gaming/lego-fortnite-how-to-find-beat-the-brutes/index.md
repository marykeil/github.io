## Literature Review

While there are no traditional End Game Boss in LEGO Fortnite the three Brutes are the strongest and most challenging enemies in the game.





The toughest monsters in LEGO Fortnite are the Brutes. These oversized enemies take a lot of damage to defeat and also deliver a lot of damage back to you. There are three versions of the Brutes which can be found in certain locations. While some are harder than others, all three can be considered the end-game bosses of LEGO Fortnite.

Despite their toughness, no current boss, or Brute, generates an end cutscene or individually is the strongest boss in the game.

 Brute Type  Biomes  Locations Frequently Found   Brutes  Grasslands  Most common open areas.   Sand  Dry Valley  Inside Lava Caves   Frost  Frostlands  Mountain areas.   






To find one of the three types of Brute in LEGO Fortnite you will need to head to a certain Biome. However, once you are in the relevant Biome area there is no guaranteed location to find each Brute, as they will spawn randomly. They have been found to appear at a higher rate in the locations listed above. You can also turn on the visual sound effects in your settings which will help to see enemies more clearly from a distance.

While the Frost Brute will often be left until last by players, all three pose a similar challenge, so they can be taken on in any order you like. Ahead of challenging the Brutes, you can take advantage of recruiting villagers, who can provide valuable support in fights against the hardest enemies.

Best Strategies for Attack &amp; Defense
          

While the three Brutes differ a similar strategy is best when facing any of them in LEGO Fortnite. You will either need to take advantage of playing in co-op with others or plan ahead of the fight to be able to overcome the strongest enemies in the game. Going into battle with a Shield will greatly reduce the amount of damage you take. All of the Brutes have four attacks you need to be wary of a normal strike, a charged strike, a stomp, and a ranged attack.




For attacks, it is best to use a long-range weapon such as the Recurve Crossbow to slowly chip away at the Brutes&#39; health whilst allowing you to keep your distance. While normal attacks can work, you will need to heal regularly as all of the Brutes deal damage at a quick rate.
