## Literature Review

Salmael is the final boss of Persona 5 Tactica. You will need to move often, shooting and ducking into cover as the field shifts and rotates.





Even with proper levels and gear, obtaining the best skills in Persona 5 Tactica is still a good idea. Joker’s God-Like Speed passive can be incredibly useful in this specific encounter. You will also want any skill that improves damage with guns.




                  Persona 5 Tactica: How to Unlock New Game&#43; (&amp; Everything That Carries Over)   Persona 5 Tactica does have a New Game&#43; available for its players, but it goes by another name and players will be surprised to see what carries over.   


 How To Defeat Salmael In Persona 5 Tactica 
          

Salmael will be fought in two phases, using a single team of four heroes. Joker is always a mandatory member, but the other three are free for you to choose. It’s a good idea to take the overall strongest and best playable characters in Persona 5 Tactica. This can include Ann, Ryuji, and Makoto. But switching to your personal favorite Phantom Thieves is also still viable.



Regardless of who you pick, you still want a focus on movement and ranged attacks. Healing and support skills are also extremely useful. Melee attacks aren’t as needed, but don’t ignore them entirely.







First Phase
The stage will take place on a giant cog, split into five platforms, forming a slight arc. The party will be split into two teams on the outer west and east platforms. Salmael will be in the dead center, while many minions will lurk around all the platforms in between.

The goal is to move to the center while always stopping behind the safety of the various nuts and bolt covers laden around. Kill any Legionnaire minions along the way so they don’t get their own turns. If all the weaker enemies are cleared, shoot Salmael directly or aid the party with one of Persona 5 Tactica’s many buffs.



The reason for moving to the center is Salmael&#39;s ability Cogs of Fate. This will rotate the entire stage wheel “forward” clockwise or “back” counter-clockwise. Platforms that enter the green energy waves will cause characters to suffer significant damage before reemerging. To avoid this, move all characters in the opposite direction so that the rotation sends them back to the center.




Second Phase
After suffering enough damage, Salmael will rip off its mask and become enraged. It will become more powerful with a set of new attacks. The biggest new mechanic is the Holy Numbers of Salvation. One of the five panels will display a digit from one to four. You must quickly move that number of characters onto the platform. Salmael will unleash Divine Judgment and deal incredibly high damage to everyone if you have too few or too many.






In the center of the stage will also be the Spire of Judgement. This does even more damage than Divine Judgment and might wipe out the whole team. But, it can be displaced with a single All-Out Attack. Concentrate on getting into position and executing this move.




Once Salmael is defeated, you can sit back and view the ending of Persona 5 Tactica. This will also begin the path to unlock New Game Plus mode. This even allows unlocking characters Goro Akechi and Kasumi Yoshizawa. They have their unique skills and stats that may prove fun when fighting Salmael again.
