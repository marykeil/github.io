## Literature Review

Using the best weapons in Zombies in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is vital to move further into the map and take down the toughest enemies.





The main objective is to complete DMZ-style contracts from different Acts of the story called Operation Deadbolt. The map is split into three different zones, with enemies getting progressively more challenging the closer you get to the center. Along with picking the best weapons, you can use Sentry Guns in Zombies to help complete the contracts and progress through the game. There are many weapons available to use in zombies to suit players of all styles, but the best ones will guide you through Operation Deadbolt&#39;s acts.
  Modern Warfare 3 Split-Screen Explained: Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies









 








 10  M4 
All-Around AR


 







While many specialist weapons are on this list, players used to playing multiplayer, or campaigns will be most at home using Assault Rifles, making them a great place to start. The M4 has been an ever-present in the Modern Warfare series and is a great all-around choice if you want to stick to the more traditional weapons. The default M4 setup is best at mid-range, and playing as part of a team can be a handy weapon to pick off individual Zombies.





 9  Holger 26 
Best LMG For Breathing Space
        

Light Machine Guns have always been a popular option when playing Zombies in Modern Warfare 3 due to the volume of bullets they can fire. With a large magazine, all Light Machine Guns can quickly give you breathing space when swamped. In particular, they are useful in the outer zones of Zombies when the enemies you face don&#39;t take many bullets. 
However, when moving into zone three to take on the hardest bosses available in Zombies, you will either want to swap out or carry a second weapon that can be used in these circumstances. If you want to use an LMG, the Holger 26 is a great choice, with enough power to kill your enemies and enough movement to keep you out of trouble.





 8  SVA 545 
Best Burst Fire AR
        

When you drop into Zombies, the default gun is more useful than many players think and can see you progress deep into the Zombies map. The SVA 545 is one of the best weapons for beginners if you can get used to the firing system. Featuring a unique burst style, it fires out two bullets simultaneously, which can take down enemies in one go. It can more than hold its own against the Zombies in the outer Zone but can struggle when facing enemies requiring more hits.





 7  Lockwood 680  
A Powerful Shotty
        

Zombies modes across the Call Of Duty series are often close combat affairs, meaning on many occasions, shotguns have ruled the roost. While this is not as true in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, they still have their place with the Lockwood 680, which is a powerful choice. The map is much bigger this time, but the Zombies will still rush at you with pace. A shotgun can quickly stop them in their tracks even if they get very close to you, so it is a fine option as a starting weapon.





 6  Striker SMG 
Quick &amp; Effective
        

Considered by many to be the best Sub-Machine Gun available across Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, The Striker is your best choice if you prefer using a lighter weapon. It gives you lots of power to fire through Zombies quickly while maintaining the speed and accuracy that SMGs across the board provide. The rate of fire of the Striker allows you to eliminate hordes rapidly, especially in the outer zone of the map. However, compared to the weapons at the top of the list, it can struggle when facing off against the stronger enemies and bosses that come in Zone 3.





 5  The Scorcher 
Best For Bosses
        

There are three Wonder Weapons available in Zombies that can&#39;t be exfiled in the same way that normal weapons can, but they are extremely powerful. The newest of the three is the Scorcher, a weapon that can primarily be used to boost and travel across the map at speed. However, it also packs a lot of damage when taking on enemies and has infinite ammo, which comes in handy when faced with hordes of zombies. A unique-looking weapon, it is one of the most effective at taking on the bosses if you are lucky enough to find it.





 4  Wunderwaffe DG-2 
The Zombie Shocker


 







The Wunderwaffe DG-2 has been a Zombies regular since the mode debuted in Call of Duty: World at War. It is one of the most powerful weapons you can find in Zombies and rightfully is one of the harder-to-get Wonder Weapons you will have to work hard to find. It shocks Zombies, stopping them in their tracks, as well as inflicting damage upon impact. Even when entering Zone Three, it can mow enemies down very quickly and can take down the toughest enemies you will face.





 3  RGL-80 Grenade Launcher 
Perfect For Crowd Control
        

The RGL-80 Grenade Launcher is one of the best of the standard weapons available for you to use in Zombies. Inflicting an incredible amount of damage from a long range can keep your enemies at a distance from you at all times. It explodes on impact with either an object or an enemy and can damage others around them. Its downside is that the RGL-80 takes a long time to reload, meaning you must remove all the zombies nearby when firing. When using the RGL-80, you also need to be aware of the smoke that is generated when shooting, which can hinder vision immediately after firing.





 2  Crossbow 
The Most Effective Weapon
        

While not for everyone, the Crossbow is an excellent option in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies due to the destruction it can cause when faced with many enemies in one go. Bullets take time to explode upon hitting the ground, but the Crossbow can be used to get rid of a chasing horde quickly. It is one of the most effective weapons zombies can use in chaotic situations, especially inside buildings when completing contracts. Aside from the Wonder Weapons, the Crossbow is the most effective in Zombies.





 1  Ray Gun 
Best Wonder Weapon


 







The final Wonder Weapon you can obtain in Zombies is the Ray Gun, which is the best weapon to use across the mode. You can&#39;t permanently keep the weapon at extraction, but there are ways you can craft it yourself. The Ray Gun has become a fan favorite in the Zombies mode due to its power and ability to eliminate enemies in one hit.
It will either take a lot of time or luck to find the Ray Gun, but once you have it, it can quickly get you through all of the Zones in Zombies and be effective against the end bosses. While not easy to get, the Ray Gun is the best weapon in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
