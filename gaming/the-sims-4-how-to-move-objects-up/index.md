## Literature Review

The Sims 4 is best known for its customization options, and building is an important part of that. Here&#39;s how to move objects up in The Sims 4.





You can move objects vertically along the wall or lift regular objects off the ground. However, the game doesn&#39;t let you do that with everything. If you want to move certain objects up, you will need to use cheats to do it. You can also use many of Sims 4&#39;s various mods to find a workaround. Regardless of the option, you will need to be in Build Mode to move objects up. To enter Build Mode, you need to select the large circular Build Mode icon in the top right corner of the screen. It can also be accessed immediately by pressing F3.




                  Sims 4: 10 Best Ways To Make Money (Without Cheats)   There are plenty of ways to make money in Sims 4, but for those wanting to avoid cheats, it will require a little more work to make Simoleons.   


 Moving Objects Up in Sims 4 Normally 
          



Players can only access Build Mode once they&#39;re actually playing the game, not in Create-a-Sim mode.




You can move most wall-related items, such as paintings, windows, shelves, and other objects, normally by highlighting different points on the wall. If you don&#39;t like using the Grid system, you can hold the ALT button while placing objects in Sims 4, and you will be able to place objects anywhere on the wall.






 Changing Sims 4 Object Height With Cheats 
          

If you wish to levitate other non-wall-related objects or move them up, you will need to use cheats in The Sims 4. To enable cheats, press the CTRL &#43; Shift &#43; C buttons together, which will open a text box. In this text box, type &#34;bb.moveobjects on&#34; as this will enable you to move objects anywhere, including when they intersect other objects.



Normally in Sims 4, cheats will need to be turned on by pressing CTRL &#43; Shift &#43; C and then typing in testingcheats true or testingcheats on. This is not necessary to do before activating the move object cheat, but it may be useful for other needed tweaks later.




After enabling the moveobjects cheat in Sims 4, players can select the object they want to move and press the 9 key. This key incrementally increases the object&#39;s height, so players can press it repeatedly until it&#39;s at the height they want.




If you want to lower objects after using this cheat, you simply need to press the 0 key. Once an object is at the desired height, you will need to hold the ALT key again to adjust it further. Once you get the hang of this cheat, you will be able to create rooms that are intricate, beautiful, and practical, depending on how you place items. If you want more customization, there are a few more cheats that might be useful as well.



 Sims 4 Build Mode Cheats 
          

Besides the moveobjects cheat, Sims 4 also offers a variety of other options if you are looking to build without worrying about money or logic. Use the following cheats to really tap into Build Mode&#39;s possibilities:
