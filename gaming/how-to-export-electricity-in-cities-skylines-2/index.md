## Literature Review

The demand for expansion in Cities: Skylines 2 can leave you spending a lot of money, making the export of electricity a good way to get it back.





A good rule of thumb regarding electricity is that you should always generate more power than your city needs, and never just the bare minimum. Making money fast in Cities: Skylines 2 only comes after you put yourself into a good position to start taking risks. If you don&#39;t focus on creating a good amount of power from the beginning, you won&#39;t have the ability to spread that electricity out into new sections of the city you might want to construct.




                  &#34;An Enjoyably Intricate City Planning Game&#34; - Cities: Skylines 2 Review   While Cities: Skylines 2 doesnâ€™t have the decade of DLC yet, it is a stunning city management game that is exactly what it should be right now.    


 How to Export Power &amp; Electricity in Cities: Skylines 2 
          

There are two steps to exporting the power generated in your city, first by building structures that produce electricity, and then connecting the power grid from those structures to a Transformer Station. An entire Electricity Menu will be your guide as you build structures that consume Fossil Fuels or find other ways to create power. Those looking to remove pollution in Cities: Skylines 2 should consider the carbon impact of various power stations.



Once you have one or more places in your city producing electricity, you can check the Electricity Trade Menu to see the exact numbers tied to each structure you&#39;ve created.







You must place down Power Lines near the structures producing power after they have been made in Cities: Skylines 2. It&#39;s best to build Power Lines underground, so they do not get in the way of other buildings that make up your city. Feel free to follow the same paths as roads to help make this process far easier to understand as you try to connect back into a Transformer Station.

Make sure your Power Lines leading out of your city are also connected to the Transformer Station to ensure the power is flowing in a way that helps you make profit. To see if your system is working, go to the City Economy menu, then the Budget tab. Navigate to Service Trade and look at the section in the bottom right to check how much money your city is making after you export electricity in Cities: Skylines 2.

    Cities: Skylines   Summary:   Cities: Skylines is a city-building simulator focused on urban planning and geographical design.
