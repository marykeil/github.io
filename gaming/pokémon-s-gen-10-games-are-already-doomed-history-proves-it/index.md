# Pokémon s Gen 10 Games Are Already Doomed (&amp; History Proves It)


## SUMMARY 



  Pokémon Gen 10 is expected to face criticism upon its release, as previous generations have faced similar challenges and negative feedback.   Emotional investment plays a big role in the Pokémon community, and newer games may not capture the same charm as childhood favorites, making it easier for flaws to overshadow positive aspects.   Game Freak, the developer of Pokémon, has received criticism for delivering games that feel compromised and lack polish. The strict release schedule and demands of the franchise&#39;s ecosystem may contribute to these issues.

## Literature Review

Gen 10 could be an exciting time for Pokémon, but it&#39;s all too easy to predict one negative aspect of how things will end up going down.




The upcoming Pokémon Gen 10 games haven&#39;t even been revealed yet, but it&#39;s already safe to say that the next generation of the series is going to struggle when it releases. There&#39;s certainly an appeal in hoping for an excellent follow-up to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, especially when expectations for a Switch successor mean that struggles with graphics and performance that have plagued recent titles might be minimized or avoided altogether on more powerful hardware. Realistically, however, the franchise isn&#39;t bound for a sudden dawning of a new golden era in public perception.




Each generation of Pokémon titles brings a host of new opportunities with it, which makes the cycle of anticipation particularly engaging each time it comes around. Plenty of beloved features or designs that have been left in the past have an opportunity to return, and the potential for interesting new regions, characters, and, of course, Pokémon ensures that there will always be more to discover. At the same time, it&#39;s not uncommon for pessimism to rise as games draw nearer, caused by anything from disappointing gameplay footage to the reveal that certain elements won&#39;t be making a reappearance.

Each Pokémon Generation Meets A Fresh Wave Of Criticism
          

If there&#39;s one sentiment that&#39;s likely to be common when Pokémon Gen 10 releases, it&#39;s the notion that Scarlet and Violet did things better. The odds are that Gen 10 will make specific concessions that trigger this sentiment, but it&#39;s also become something of a tradition at this point when the time comes for any new Pokémon generation. General dissatisfaction with certain decisions by developer Game Freak has made looking at the negative side of new releases more popular than ever, and the downsides of a new generation are likely to receive a bigger spotlight than any improvements it might make.






At the time of this writing, Pokémon Gen 10 games have not been officially announced nor confirmed.




At this point, it&#39;s hard not to see the refrain that the last generation was better as something of a broken record, and it often feels silly when sentiment swings so quickly from criticism that was likely dominating the conversation only months before. There&#39;s obviously plenty of legitimacy in many of the complaints, and those deriding one generation aren&#39;t always the same people complimenting it when the next arrives. Nevertheless, the predictability of the discourse can become exhausting at a certain point, especially in a series that releases like clockwork thanks to a larger market ecosystem that the games are only one part of.

 It&#39;s Easy To Find New Pokémon Games Disappointing 
Emotional Investment Is A Big Part Of Pokémon
          




When it comes to most of the Pokémon community, the odds are that any individual fan will have a set favorite generation by the time they reach adulthood. Pokémon is designed for a young market first and foremost, and the excitement of exploring a world full of fascinating creatures as a kid is uniquely compelling. Although the fundamental charm and appeal of the series keeps many hooked well past their younger years, newer entries are unlikely to recapture that same experience, making it easier for their flaws to overwhelm the positive aspects.

Like with any long-running franchise, each successive Pokémon entry captures a certain number of newcomers who are more likely to hold it in esteem than series veterans. The latter group will have the most sway over mainstream discourse around Pokémon Gen 10 at the time of its release, but the voice of the former usually grows with time, resulting in a stronger expression of positive sentiments as the years pass. Neither of these groups is necessarily any less valid than the other, and finding a balance between expressing deserved criticism and respecting the enjoyment of others is a valuable approach.

The Pokémon Series Has Its Fair Share Of Problems
         

That being said, there&#39;s a legitimate reason that Pokémon generations meet with fiercer feedback than new installments of franchises like Mario and Zelda. Game Freak has struggled to deliver games with the polish and attention to detail that fans are looking for, resulting in products that often feel compromised in one way or another. The strict demands of a schedule where game launches feed into a rigidly planned ecosystem of plushes, toys, apparel, and the Pokémon TCG is no doubt part of this, forcing hard release dates on games that could sometimes use delays.

The amount of complaints about each successive generation never seems to translate into any significant harm to sales, so the overall approach that Game Freak takes to development is unlikely to significantly change as long as the games are performing well. Of course, there&#39;s still a chance that Pokémon Gen 10 could be an all-around improvement to Gen 9, and the odds are decent that any new compromises it introduces are counterbalanced by exciting positive changes. Regardless of how it ends up, the cycle of criticism that elevates Scarlet and Violet at the time of the Gen 10 launch is the most predictable element of the release.

Pokémon Gen 11 Will Repeat The Cycle
          

Equally predictable is the next installment of the cycle, which should see more positive discourse around Pokémon Gen 10 when Gen 11 someday releases. In a way, there&#39;s a certain cosmic balance to the whole affair, with every game getting its due share of mainstream criticism and appreciation in a fairly regular fashion. Ideally, however, the situation would be less stratified by time, making it so that more healthy and nuanced conversations about the state of the franchise could be had at any given point in the cycle.




 : Pokémon Gen 10 Games Can Shake Up The Series With This Starter Change

The rabbit hole goes much deeper, as even complaining about people complaining about Pokémon is itself a repetitive practice. There&#39;s no sense trying not to talk about it at all, however, so meditating on the fruitlessness of Pokémon discourse serves as well as anything else. It would be nice to see both new Pokémon games and the wild swings of approval that surround them improve over time, but as far as Gen 10 goes, there&#39;s little doubt that the initial response will be less than charitable overall.

               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
