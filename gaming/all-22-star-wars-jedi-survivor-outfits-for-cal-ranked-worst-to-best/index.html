  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
makes a large improvement on the customization options of its predecessor,
Fallen Order
, by including 22 different outfits for Cal to wear.
Some unique cosmetic items are single garments, rather than a whole outfit, but they may still help players create a distinct style for Cal.
Jedi: Survivors
best outfits look fitting for Cal and his personality, have plenty of color options, or are even an homage to the
Star Wars
franchise at large.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Players can now customize Cal to their hearts&rsquo; content, but the best outfits in Jedi: Survivor will have him looking his best on the battlefield.</p>
<p>In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Cal Kestis makes a return as a Jedi who is much more powerful and skilled than ever before, and with the game&rsquo;s best outfits, players can ensure he&rsquo;s more stylish, too. The game features a far larger list of clothing options than the prequel Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and as the protagonist explores several planets, he&rsquo;ll come across a wide variety of pieces to mix and match. But with so many different clothing pieces to unlock throughout their journey, it can become overwhelming for players to determine which Jedi: Survivor outfits are actually the best.
Thanks to the extensive customization options in Jedi: Survivor, players are now at liberty to not only choose Cal&rsquo;s outfit but also his hairstyle and facial hair. None of these personalizations provide any gameplay perks or combat advantages, but being able to style a character from head to toe takes the immersion of the experience to the next level nonetheless. For his clothing, Cal has 13 outfits that can be put together from individual pieces that make up a set, and then there are several more items, particularly jackets, which are not directly related to any of the named outfits. These are included on the list, despite not being full outfits per se, as they are certainly stylish in their own right.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Interview — Writers Danny Homan &amp; Pete Stewart Break Down Dagan Gera&rsquo;s Emotional Story
Star Wars: Jedi Survivor Lead Writer Danny Homan &amp; Senior Writer Pete Stewart break down Dagan Gera&rsquo;s emotional story and High Republic canon.</p>
<p>22  Training Shirt
Shirt Only</p>
<p>Being a mere sleeveless tank, the Training Shirt is the worst outfit item in the game thanks to its overwhelmingly basic design (as demonstrated above by SwanyPlaysGames on YouTube). The various color swatches atone for its lack of complexity somewhat, but players looking for a bit more flair will be better off selecting from the game&rsquo;s other clothing options.</p>
<p>21  Bandolier Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s technically classified as a jacket, the Bandolier Jacket isn&rsquo;t really much of one at all. This item is a certain step up from the Training Shirt, but as JorRaptor on YouTube showcases, it only consists of a shoulder pad and a cross-body leather strap. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s an uninteresting minimalist piece that struggles to shine compared to all of Jedi: Survivor&rsquo;s other outfits.</p>
<p>20  Mountaineer Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>The Mountaineer Jacket provides something of substance, but it still leaves a bit to be desired. The tattered woven chest piece paired with a plain long-sleeved shirt might be ideal for outdoor adventuring, but it, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t provide much in the way of style. For Cal, this piece doesn&rsquo;t even appear all that comfortable or useful, and he would be better off with nearly any other option available in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor instead.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: How To Customize Cal, BD-1, and Lightsaber
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor features new cosmetics for Cal Kestis, his lightsaber and BD-1. To use them, players must pass an early story milestone.</p>
<p>19  Pilot Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>Although players can&rsquo;t actually pilot Cal&rsquo;s ship when making use of Jedi: Survivor&rsquo;s fast travel system, the Flight Jacket still earns some points for style. Fans of the more immersive roleplay experience can also use the Pilot Jacket to help create more of a sense of realism when Cal is flying his ship. Whether flying or not, the look of this sleek leather jacket is timeless, and it&rsquo;ll match just about any set of pants well.</p>
<p>18  Corsair Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>The Corsair Jacket is another leather jacket without an outfit to make it a set, but it has a bit more personality than the Flight Jacket. Thanks to its fleece-lined collar and sleeve cuffs, there is much more visual appeal in this very warm-looking coat. The protagonist doesn&rsquo;t have a chance to explore any colder climates during his adventures, but he&rsquo;ll look cool nonetheless while wearing this piece.</p>
<p>17  Duelist Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>The asymmetrical design of the Duelist Jacket makes for some truly unique outfits in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. The otherwise ordinary tunic sets itself apart by being half sleeveless, giving Cal a chance to intimidate his opponents with his muscles, all while maintaining a clean look. The one sleeve on and one sleeve off look can also present the idea that Cal had his sleeve ripped from his shirt, which could still be equally intimidating in a way.</p>
<p>16  Exile Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>The Exile Jacket also reimagines the look of classic garb, combining two different colors and materials to create one new and surprisingly cohesive article of clothing. This item maintains the heart of the traditional Jedi look, all while giving it a slightly edgier twist. Due to the Exile Jacket already having a mix of different materials and colors, it can look good with nearly any pair of pants in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p>
<p>15  Drifter Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>The Drifter Jacket is the most stylish individual clothing piece that players can collect, with an edgy and detailed design built into the jacket. Its clean, symmetrical lines, thick belt, and intricate metal embellishments prove that this item distinguishes itself by its refined style, and it can create some of the best outfits in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. It is a shame that the developers of the game did not create an entire outfit around the Drifter Jacket, as that would likely have been a very impressive look.</p>
<p>14  Poncho Jacket
Jacket Only</p>
<p>The Poncho Jacket is one that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order players won&rsquo;t want to miss. Cal&rsquo;s infamous poncho from the previous game has indeed survived the five years in between, and players can relive the memories with this hilariously simple item of clothing, especially when paired with the Scrapper pants and shirt. Although Fallen Order included over twenty ponchos that Cal could don, apparently for Survivor times, he only likes to keep one around (albeit with changeable color scheme) for nostalgia purposes.</p>
<p>13  Jedi Outfit
Jacket &amp; Pants</p>
<p>The Jedi outfit in Jedi: Survivor, which consists of a jacket and pants, is naturally a major upgrade from singular chest pieces, but it&rsquo;s also one of the nicest-looking sets in the game. The combination of plain garb and loose-fitting pants isn&rsquo;t anything new to marvel at, but there&rsquo;s an undeniable beauty to behold in its simplicity, as well as feeling right at home in the Star Wars universe with the proper sense of a Jedi at play. Particularly since he&rsquo;s now a Jedi himself, it&rsquo;s the perfect outfit for Cal to wear while showing off his new force powers in Jedi: Survivor.</p>
<p>12  Hermit Outfit
Jacket &amp; Pants</p>
<p>The Jedi outfit above isn&rsquo;t the only way to show off the traditional feeling of the franchise. Star Wars fans can take the Jedi love a step further with the Hermit outfit. This set is not only stylish and timeless in its own right, but more excitingly, it resembles Obi-Wan Kenobi&rsquo;s memorable costume in A New Hope. Unfortunately, the Hermit outfit is only available to those who pre-ordered the game.</p>
<p>Jon Carr &amp; Paul Hatfield Interview: Creating Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
Two of the developers behind the upcoming Star Wars Jedi: Survival discuss creating the new entry in the franchise and continuing Cal&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>11  Frontier Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>Full outfits in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor consist of pants, a shirt, and a jacket - which make for the most comprehensive looks and thus, are the most worthwhile items to obtain and collect. Despite fitting the requirements of a full outfit set, the Frontier Outfit is the worst of the bunch, and it struggles to compete next to the other sets. As ZaFrostPet showcases on YouTube, the crude nature of the chest plate isn&rsquo;t aided much by the presence of the scarf, and the weathering of the entire get-up ultimately sacrifices just as much style as it contributes to immersion.</p>
<p>10  Hunter Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>Out of all Jedi: Survivor outfits, the Hunter Outfit is definitely one of a kind, but it&rsquo;s not the most fashionable choice (at least by modern standards). As shown in a YouTube video by Arbuckle, Cal&rsquo;s body is draped in reptilian skin and other creature parts, which certainly demonstrate his hunting prowess, but not in the most aesthetically pleasing way. Given the powers that Cal has and the mission he is on, this outfit feels a bit contradictory to his overall nature and seems out of place in this game. It is a unique piece, but not one that gives a good first impression to anyone of the Jedi.</p>
<p>9  Survivor Outfit<br>
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>Being Cal&rsquo;s default look in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the aptly-named Survivor Outfit is a safe, yet stylish choice. The protagonist looks ready for action in this vest-like jacket over a shirt with sleeves pushed up, and he appears to have pockets everywhere on his cargo pants and jacket to hold anything he could possibly need. In a way, its only drawback is simply how overused it has been in all promotional marketing of the game, because it takes away a bit of uniqueness when it is shown off as often as it is. The Survivor Outfit does offer many different color combinations to help personalize it, though, which helps.</p>
<p>8  Outrider Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>The Outrider Outfit takes itself a bit more seriously, but it does so in a way that doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice fashion for function. It&rsquo;s one of the best outfits in Jedi: Survivor for those who like to role-play and immerse themselves in the game, as it contains a bit of everything - a belt full of useful items, armor in the form of shin guards and a shoulder pad, and to top it all off, a cropped puffer vest and a small, nifty scarf. Mixing up some of the colors a bit as well can add to the personalized look, although the simple, natural browns can give the appearance of Cal camouflaging nicely when out in the desert areas.</p>
<p>7  Tactical Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>Players who truly prioritize being combat-ready should look no further than the Tactical Outfit. This set includes many color options for personalization and gives a very strong and confident look. Nearly every part of this clothing set looks like it was designed for the complicated battles requiring physical and mental endurance that Cal faces in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. From the more pronounced and less weathered armor to the many pockets on the cargo pants, Cal is ready to go. The only part of the Tactical Outfit that doesn&rsquo;t benefit Cal during fights is the long, flowing cape, but this accessory is something that many players will likely accept with open arms.</p>
<p>6  Bomber Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>The Bomber Outfit is easily one of the best looking outfits in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, for more than one reason. This look builds upon the effortless cool of the classic leather jacket, pairing it with lovable details, such as the various textures, patches, and pockets of the pants, or the goggles around the neck. Whichever mount Cal chooses to ride, he&rsquo;ll ride it in style with the Bomber Outfit - and so will BD-1, thanks to the special fortified patch on the back of the jacket.</p>
<p>5  Commander Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>Players will quickly learn that the protagonist&rsquo;s missions are nothing short of dangerous, but with the Commander Outfit equipped, they can rest assured that he is prepared to face any foe head-on. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor does not provide buffs for the outfits that Cal wears, but if they did, then this set would likely be the strongest, as it&rsquo;s by far the most heavily armored. With a solid metal chest plate, boots, and even an armored piece fitted around one of his hands, Cal is without a doubt ready to command any situation in this outfit.</p>
<p>4  Scrapper Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>A lot happened in between Jedi: Survivor and Jedi: Fallen Order, but those who have played the prequel game should be pleased to know that Cal&rsquo;s other iconic outfit hasn&rsquo;t been lost in the timeline. The Scrapper Outfit, though it&rsquo;s aged a bit (just like the protagonist himself) still holds up as a solid choice in fashion, even putting sentiment aside. However, it&rsquo;s hard to deny that the best part about this outfit is the nostalgia, which can be amplified tenfold when pairing it with the familiar Scrapper hair.</p>
<p>Everything That Happened Between Jedi: Fallen Order &amp; Jedi: Survivor
A lot has happened since Fallen Order for the Stinger Mantis crew and the galaxy at large. Here is a quick synopsis ahead of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p>
<p>3  Wanderer Outfit
Jacket, Shirt, &amp; Pants</p>
<p>As far as style goes, the Wanderer Outfit is the one that would be worn while walking the Galactic fashion show runways in Jedi: Survivor. This sleek outfit brings a bit of everything to the table, including elements of traditional Jedi wear with the long, flowing garb and the simple fabric belt tied around his waist. Utilitarian components are also present, from Cal&rsquo;s various belts to strapped-up boots; but none of the style has been sacrificed, with a popped collar, turtleneck shirt, and fingerless gloves. The end result is a wonderfully balanced look that players of all walks should be able to enjoy.</p>
