## Literature Review

Virtual racecar drivers can look forward to many new games in 2024 ranging from F1 racing or off-road muddy driving to chaotic battle royales. 




Many new racing video games are expected to be released in 2024, with some coming to every platform. Racing games can take on many meanings, from traditional Formula One racecars speeding around a track to cartoonish kart racers pushing each other out of the way. Whichever type of racing one is looking for, there&#39;s going to be a lot to choose from over the next few months.
Technology becomes even more impressive with every passing year, which can be particularly evident in the racing video game genre. Not only in the graphics but also in the precise details required to make the feel of driving, drifting, and even braking seem as realistic as possible, it can be a challenging goal to achieve for a game. Many of the games that will be debuting in 2024 appear to be striving to hit this mark. Of course, even the more lighthearted racing games look like they will be fun inducements to hit that gas pedal this year.
