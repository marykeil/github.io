## Literature Review

The Quizzy Quester in Like a Dragon Gaiden will offer up six unique quizzes as Kiryu progresses through the game, with a bonus for right answers.





Though it&#39;s not necessary to get any of these trivia questions correct, players who do successfully provide the right answer will receive a reward in the form of money. The Quizzy Quester will be found specifically by heading to the white checkpoint located near the Bishamon Bridge and the Sotenbori Footpath in Like a Dragon Gaiden, on the second floor in a top hat.

Mission: Challenge To The Informant
         

Unless you&#39;ve been studiously studying Sotenbori, many of these questions may be a little difficult to answer on the spot as some of them get pretty specific. To complete the associated mission, Challenge To The Informant, Kiryu will need to answer six different questions.

                  &#34;A Brilliant Reintroduction&#34; - Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name Review   Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is a wonderful, short adventure that wraps up some of Kiryu&#39;s loose threads and tugs on others.   

Each question is its own quiz, and they will not all unlock at once. Instead, players will need to wait for their Network Level to increase before they can receive the next quiz. The white exclamation point will reappear once a new quiz becomes available in Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.






If the wrong answer is selected, the mission will not automatically fail. Instead, the incorrect answer will be removed, and the game will continue to narrow down the possible answers until the player guesses correctly. The only downside to this is that players will miss out on the bonus reward for getting it right on the first try, which is an additional 10,000 Yen per question for a total of &#43;60,000 Yen.
