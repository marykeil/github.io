## Literature Review

You can beat Team GO Rocket Leader Cliff in Pokémon GO easily if you pick the right line-up that is super-effective against him this December 2023.





Like all other Team GO Rocket Leaders, Cliff saw a change in his lineup in late October, but this has not changed further for December 2023. You will need to defeat grunts before facing Cliff, but you will need to get past him if you want to take on Team GO Rocket boss Giovanni.

Cliff&#39;s line-up in Pokémon GO is the same as November, with Dragon-type Dratini being his most recent addition. He will then pick one of three Pokémon for his next two options. Cliff&#39;s first choice will be one of Water- and Psychic-type Slowking, Psychic- and Flying-type Gallade, or Rock- and Grass-type Cradily. Before his final Pokémon, which will be either Ghost-type Dusknoir, Ice- and Ground-type Mamoswine, or Rock- and Dark- Tyranitar.

 Best Counters For Cliff In Pokémon GO (December 2023) 
          

Cliff&#39;s first Pokémon in Pokémon GO will always be Dratini, which isn&#39;t the strongest in battle and is weak to Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks. Due to this, you should start with a Pokémon that is super-effective against it, such as Fairy- and Flying- Togekiss. The Generation 4 Pokémon can easily take out Cliff&#39;s first Pokémon and is also strong against Tyranitar and Gallade.



For a second choice, Cradily, Tyranitar, and Mamoswine are all weak to Fighting-type attacks, so using a Fighting-type such as Machamp can easily defeat any of these three if Cliff picks them.




There are a few options for a third Pokémon to include as a backup against Cliff in case Togekiss and Machamp can&#39;t get the job done, including Dark- and Rock-type Tyranitar. However, the best choice is Ghost-type Gengar. The Gen 1 Pokémon can cover Cliff&#39;s remaining options, including Slowking, Gallade, and the tough Dusknoir.




Cliff remains one of the hardest battles you can face in December 2023 in Pokémon GO, but by selecting the right team, you can easily overcome him.
