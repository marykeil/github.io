# Genshin Impact s Newest Character Already Has The Most Confusing Name

## Literature Review

Genshin Impact has made some big reveals for Version 4.4, and one new character has a name with the potential to cause a lot of problems.




Genshin Impact has just unveiled the most recent character addition to its line-up, and the new arrival has a name that&#39;s definitely going to cause some headaches. The ever-expanding roster is a major aspect of Genshin Impact&#39;s enduring appeal, as new updates frequently bring characters with different playstyles and personalities. Keeping track of them all can be difficult for newcomers, but the distinct names with linguistic roots in a variety of cultural inspirations can sometimes make it easier to tell them apart.




The newest Genshin Impact reveals are slated to arrive in Version 4.4, which is expected to hit the game in late January 2024. Recent Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks and rumors have teased elements of the update, which might actually focus on expanding older map areas from the game rather than the newest region of Fontaine. Although much of 4.4 remains merely the subject of speculation for now, official character reveals have provided the first official look at major content additions planned for the first 2024 update.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: New Skins May Be The Most Beautiful So Far   According to leaks, Genshin Impact will introduce two new skins in Version 4.4 - and they have the potential to be the most beautiful ones so far.   


 Genshin Impact&#39;s New Character Is Named Gaming 
          

Genshin Impact officially revealed a new Pyro character on Twitter, and the immediate standout of the announcement is that his name is Gaming. It doesn&#39;t take much thought to realize how much confusion this could cause, as Gaming obviously has other connotations in the English language. Trying to figure out a smart way to optimize the character by searching &#34;Gaming build,&#34; for example, is more likely to bring up PC rigs than Genshin Impact equipment. It&#39;s also a fundamentally amusing moniker, and there&#39;s little doubt that the community will have plenty of fun with it even before version 4.4 even releases.






 Genshin Impact&#39;s Gaming Comes From Cantonese 
          

Gaming&#39;s English spelling in Genshin Impact is essentially a weird quirk of how the game approaches the names of characters from Liyue, the Genshin Impact region that&#39;s based off of China. The script for his name would be anglicized as Jia Ming when read in Mandarin, but reading it in Cantonese produces Ga Ming. Genshin Impact always follows Cantonese for Liyue names, and the game also elides spaces between the two parts of a first name, as seen in examples like Chongyun. The name obviously isn&#39;t actually pronounced like the English word &#34;gaming,&#34; but the resemblance certainly won&#39;t do any favors to how players say it.

Gaming could be an interesting addition to Genshin Impact, with a basis in the tradition of the lion dance associated with Chinese New Year. This makes him the perfect choice to join the game alongside the yearly Lantern Rite festival, which will return to Liyue with Genshin Impact update 4.4 to coincide with the real celebrations. It shouldn&#39;t be all that long until more details about how he plays come to light, but remembering to include &#34;Genshin Impact&#34; in any search query might be critical to ever find out more about Gaming.
