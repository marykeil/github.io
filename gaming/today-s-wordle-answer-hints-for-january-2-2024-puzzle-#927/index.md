## Literature Review

Ready for a new Wordle? If not, we&#39;ve got some helpful hints, as well as the fully spoiled answer, to today&#39;s Wordle.





If a more difficult challenge is what you prefer there are several ways to increase the difficulty. Many copycats exist that make the game more troublesome and force you into playing the classic game of Wordle in different ways. Wordle also provides its own Hard Mode that can be accessed through the options menu before starting a game.




                  Wordle 4 Times At Once With Quordle Is An Even Harder Challenge   New game Quordle ups the challenge of the internet sensation Wordle by forcing players to solve four different puzzles at the same time.

Before we fully spoil today&#39;s Wordle answer we wanted to provide a few hints to help out anyone who may be struggling.

 Hint 1  There is a single repeated letter in today&#39;s answer.   Hint 2  The answer is used as a noun or an adjective.   Hint 3  The vowels are in the 1st &amp; 3rd position.   Hint 4  The process of growing old.   





 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
January 2nd #927
          




The January 2nd Wordle answer is AGING.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which immediately provided two vowels, just in the wrong positions. With vowels in hand, we shuffled them about a bit and tried FRIAR as our second word. This locked in the &#39;I&#39; but left us with another misplacement for the &#39;A&#39;. 

Moving forward, we tried PAINS as our third guess, another incorrect location for the &#39;A&#39; but this did add in the correct spot for &#39;N&#39; and narrowed down the possibilities for our slippery vowel. CHINA was our fourth guess and, once again, we got the &#39;A&#39; wrong. This works out though since there is only one possible spot that the &#39;A&#39; can go we knew it had to be first and quickly jumped in to score our Wordle win-in-five with the correct answer AGING.
