# The Perfect Marvels Spider-Man 2 DLC Is A Completely Different Game


## SUMMARY 



  A DLC for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 could shake things up by altering everything about the core gameplay.

## Literature Review

There are many possibilities when it comes to a DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but the best one would completely change the game and story. 




The perfect DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 could significantly improve the story, but it would be a completely different game in terms of both gameplay and narrative. The popular action-adventure title by Insomniac Games allows players to take control of Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they face new threats to New York City, but this time even more united. Both heroes take on their Spider-Man persona to fight crime in the city and stop Kraven’s plans, as they try to understand the presence of the Symbiote known as Venom. Other than Peter and Miles, there are many returning characters, such as Mary Jane.




Though the game concludes in a well-wrapped manner, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 sets up Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 with the introduction of the possible villains and a hint at how the story will develop moving forward. It seems like there will be big plot twists if the next title is ever developed but, even before that, Insomniac could make the perfect DLC while exploring an unexpected aspect of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. This would make the experience completely different from the general feeling of the base game itself, but it could be one of the best pieces of content, making the title much richer in terms of gameplay and story.

  


 Mary Jane Could Star A DLC In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 
MJ&#39;s Gameplay Has Been Enhanced
         




A fantastic DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 could put Mary Jane in the spotlight, stepping a bit away from Miles and Peter. The character already has a presence in the vanilla game, and her gameplay experience has been significantly refined when compared to the first entry in the series by Insomniac. While the lack of web-slinging acrobatics and fast-paced combat would be missed, these marking gameplay elements could be substituted by a mix of new and exclusive mechanics that could make playing with Mary Jane even more fun. There are several gameplay possibilities to explore with her in a DLC, as well as narrative developments.

                  Every Playable Character In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Ranked Worst To Best   Much like 2018&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 also has some surprising sequences in which players control other supporting characters.    



 Mary Jane’s DLC In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Would Make A Great Third-Person Stealth Shooter 
The DLC Could Be The Last Of Us-Styled
          




Having Mary Jane in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 be the star of a DLC could transform the entire expansion into a third-person stealth shooter. As aforementioned, her general gameplay in the second game has already improved significantly, with better stealth mechanics and more agency in combat. This could be developed even further in an expansion. During the game, Mary Jane confirmed that she has received training from Silver Sable, so players could get to see more of her abilities when facing opponents. With stealth as the core of the experience and combat as an emergency type of engagement, players could be looking at a The Last of Us-styled experience.

Because Mary Jane is a civilian without superhero powers (so far), she could have some sort of bulletproof vest to justify her health loss when facing armed enemies – or perhaps have a health bar mechanic like Uncharted, in which the character is not damaged per si, but sees the danger rise as more shots are fired in her direction until she actually gets hit and killed. A small ability tree in the Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 DLC with Mary Jane could have her improve her bulletproof vest to be able to sustain more damage or have more luck when dodging bullets and avoiding damage.




In addition to her survivability and health bar mechanic, Mary Jane could get more offensive options, making her ultimately more combat-ready. This could include some web grenades designed by Peter Parker in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and perhaps even upgrades to her already overpowered stun gun, such as web-based enhancements. The ability tree could also play a part here, granting her more ammo per magazine, a faster reload time, different types of barrels, like a silencer, and maybe even alternative firing modes, such as fully automatic. This way, the content could stem away from the traditional experience, but still be deeply woven into the core gameplay of Insomniac’s title.

Mary Jane could also have improved stealth skills in a DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, making her ability to move along undetected get even better, with a smaller radius of detection, and maybe even a gadget that grants her invisibility. Of course, this would need to be accompanied by skills that allow her to disengage and hide if found and even more combat options to quickly take down opponents from the shadows. A full expansion focused on such an experience would be very different from what is offered with Peter and Miles, but it would be welcome, as the Mary Jane experience has already proven it can be fun.






 Mary Jane’s DLC Could Improve Marvel’s Spider-Man 2’s Story 
MJ&#39;s DLC Would Lean Into A Suspense-Based Crime-Drama
          

Of course, the gameplay itself would not be the only selling aspect of a Mary Jane DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The character plays a pivotal role in Peter’s life and having her as an ally is crucial to crime-fighting. With Mary Jane becoming an independent journalist who is not tied to a corporate agenda, the character could be set to investigate and track a new and covert source of danger, such as an underground criminal system. In fact, she could even be put on the trail of The Hand, which has been somewhat teased in-game, and ties in with the rumors of a Daredevil-based DLC.

With such a story, Mary Jane could be the primary subject of the DLC without having to rely on constant assistance from Peter or Miles, as they also have tasks to complete and crimes to fight. A slow-burn crime drama in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 with Mary Jane could have her investigating a sequence of weird crimes that lead up to her finding out that she is knee-deep into something that she herself is not prepared to deal with – thus setting the ground for a second DLC, perhaps the aforementioned Daredevil one, which sees Matt Murdock fighting off the criminals that were uncovered by Mary Jane’s investigative prowess.




There are many narrative possibilities to explore and several exciting elements to add to her gameplay kit with a DLC focused on Mary Jane. Though it seems like an unlikely content, it would easily make for one of the best possible expansions, due to its uniqueness combined with how much Mary Jane’s combat has improved. So far it is uncertain if Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 will actually have a DLC.
