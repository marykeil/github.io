## Literature Review

There are a ton of different scrap loot items found in the horror indie Lethal Company, but not all of the items are valuable or useful. 




In Lethal Company, the entire goal of the game is to find high-value items to sell back to The Company to meet the quota and save their own lives. Scrap items in Lethal Company can&#39;t be purchased and are found at varying rarities on the game&#39;s moons. While the vast majority of scrap items the party will find will simply be sold without a second thought, not all of the items are created equal, with some even possessing unique functionalities.
In Lethal Company, two-handed items prevent characters from interacting with the environment (like climbing up ladders) and picking up loot, so keep this in mind when searching for the most valuable items in the game. Two-handed items are also more likely to be heavier, which causes stamina to deplete quicker. The credit value for items will fluctuate depending on the item and is dictated by the market value for each item, though it&#39;s more than likely the value will be below the max value.
            
 
 Is Lethal Company On PS5 Or Xbox Consoles? 
Lethal Company is a smash indie hit on Steam, connecting friends together to investigate dank &amp; creepy corridors, but is it currently on PS5 or Xbox?












 








 10  Remote (20-48 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed
        

While the Remote&#39;s value is nothing to write home about, the functionality it has to turn the ship&#39;s lights on and off makes it worthy of being one of the cooler scrap items in Lethal Company. Found on the Moons Vow, Offense, March, and Assurance, it&#39;s certainly worth holding on to at least one Remote for its fun functionality, especially because it usually doesn&#39;t sell for much.





 9  Airhorn &amp; Clown Horn (52-72 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed


 







The Airhorn and Clown horn are some of the most fun pieces of scrap loot one can find in Lethal Company and can often be found on most of the game&#39;s Moons. Even though they don&#39;t really have much practical use (other than annoying teammates), they are higher-value items that don&#39;t weigh anything, making them some of the more lucrative items in the game. On top of that, horns can be used to make a horn noise, which can annoy teammates on the ship or help attract creatures to the party.
A Loud horn can be purchased for 150 credits if one can&#39;t find an Airhorn or Clown horn. 






 8  Laser Pointer (32-100 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed
        

While not the most valuable item in the game, Laser pointers, like the Airhorn, actually have some useability in the game, as it&#39;s possible to use them to point to different things in-game (or blind your teammates). Laser pointers can be found on a variety of moons, including Offense, Assurance, and Titan, among others. Unlike other scrap items in the game, the ability to point to important things in the game as a replacement for voice makes the Laser pointer one of the better loot items.
            
 
 A $10 PC Game Is Taking Over Steam (&amp; You&#39;ve Probably Never Heard Of It) 
Steam&#39;s newest big hit is a real dark horse candidate, but its unstoppable rise over the course of a month shows that it has no shortage of appeal.








 7  Red Soda (18-90 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed
        

Red soda is one of the more valauble loot items in Lethal Company and can be found pretty early in the game on Titan, Rend, Dine, and other moons. At only seven pounds and a large variance in value, Red soda still comes in as an item one should loot when they see it for its great earning potential.





 6  Hair Dryer (60-100 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed
        

As a one-handed item that only weighs 7 pounds, the Hair dryer is one of the better, more valuable items one can find in Lethal Company. On top of that, people can turn on the hairdryer for an annoying sound effect that can attract monsters, much like the Airhorn.

 5  Fancy Lamp (60-128 Credits) 
Type: Two-Handed
        

Fancy lamps are a high-value item that has the useful utility of also creating a light source for the party. While the Fine lamp is a two-handed item, it makes up for this with its relatively low weight at only 21 pounds. Certainly worth it to pick up; this scrap item can be found on Rend, Dine, and Titan.





 4  Cash Register (80-160 Credits) 
Type: Two-Handed


 







Though the Cash register is the second-most valuable item in the game, valued at just below the Gold bar, there are a few key things holding it back from being a better scrap item. One is the fact that it&#39;s the heaviest item in the entire game at 84 pounds, which reduces stamina and agility significantly. Secondly, it&#39;s a two-handed item, meaning that going up and down ladders and interacting with the environment becomes impossible while carrying it. Even though the Cash register is hard to transport, it&#39;s still one of the most valuable items in the game.





 3  Bee Hive (40-150 Credits) 
Type: Two-Handed


 







The Bee hive is one of the few items in Lethal Company that spawn outside of the instance, and also one of the few items that can actually fight back in the game. Though avoiding the vicious stings of the Circuit bees and their sanity drain is something to keep in mind, it&#39;s possible to coordinate a pickup so that another player distracts the swarm while someone else secures the hive on the ship.

 2  Perfume Bottle (48-104 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed
        

The Perfume bottle is another one-handed item that can be sold for a pretty hefty 104 credits on the high end. On top of this, it literally weighs nothing, making it one of the more valuable items to get without the stamina penalty. As one of the game&#39;s few luxury items, it&#39;s one of the best loot pieces in the game and spawns on the Moons Dine, Rend, and Titan.





 1  Gold Bar (102-210 Credits) 
Type: One-Handed
        

Gold bars are not only the most valuable items in the game, but they are also one-handed items, enabling players to interact with the environment and climb ladders while looting it. Gold bars are incredibly rare and have super low spawn rates on March and Experimentation, so one shouldn&#39;t bet on finding one soon in Lethal Company. They also weigh 77 pounds, making them one of the heaviest items in the game.
