## Literature Review

The Crossbow can be a powerful weapon in Alan Wake 2, but you can only get this hunter tool from a Cult Stash hidden deep in the dangerous woods.





The Crossbow sits inside a Cult Stash or a container that usually gives you plenty of valuables such as ammo, batteries, or even health items. Most of these act like puzzle boxes you must solve by figuring out a combination code that opens the Stash. The terrifying enemies and creepy world of Alan Wake 2 make every expedition for a Stash risky, so make sure you stockpile supplies before attempting to reach one.




                  Alan Wake 2 Ending Explained (In Detail)   Alan Wake 2 ends just as cryptically as it begins. Hereâ€™s what happens in the final chapters of the story, and what they mean for a sequel or DLC.    


 How To Find The Crossbow In Alan Wake 2 
          

You can find the Crossbow northeast of Watery, far above the Downtown area, in a Cult Stash tucked outside a small hut. You may spot the Stash container next to some collection of logs that must have been used to practice aiming with the weapon.



There are some Crossbow Bolts you can collect from the numbered targets around here, which are all located to the right of the Stash box.




The combination to the Cult Stash is &#34;527&#34; based on the clues left in the attached paper on a clipboard seen resting on the container in Alan Wake 2. You can reach this solution by highlighting which signs were hit with Crossbow Bolts near the Stash box. The number &#34;5&#34; was hit with one bolt, indicating that it is the first number in the padlock&#39;s combination. &#34;2&#34; has two Bolts, while &#34;7&#34; has three to give you the other numbers.




Once you enter the number correctly, the box will open to reveal the Crossbow, along with a creepy message. The ominous note reads, &#34;If you aren&#39;t wearing the mask, this does not belong to you,&#34; which should remind you which enemies you are taking the weapon from. Those who get the Crossbow have a useful weapon in Alan Wake 2 that works against a variety of enemies since you can recover the Bolts used to conserve ammo.
