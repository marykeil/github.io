## Literature Review

The full reveal of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has also shown off the game&#39;s cast, which includes both new and returning characters.




Three years after it was first teased by Bethesda Softworks, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, developed by Machine Games (makers of the modern Wolfenstein series), has had a full reveal at the 2024 Developer_Direct from Xbox, revealing many of the game&#39;s major characters. As a game set in the same continuity as the Indiana Jones movies, Great Circle includes a number of returning characters, but also includes some additions that are completely new to the game.




From the time of The Great Circle&#39;s initial reveal, the at-the-time unnamed game has mostly been kept tightly under wraps, although some leaks for Indiana Jones did preemptively reveal the title. As of the Developer_Direct, however, developers from Machine Games have revealed a substantial amount of detail about the game, including its gameplay, the narrative&#39;s place in the Indiana Jones timeline, and some of the major characters, new and returning, involved in the game&#39;s story. While there&#39;s still more to reveal, the game&#39;s main cast is seemingly mostly accounted for.

                  New Indiana Jones Game Reveals First-Ever Gameplay   The new Indiana Jones game by LucasFilm Games and Bethesda received its first official gameplay footage, over three years after it was announced.

While the new trailers and showcases for The Great Circle have introduced a number of new characters, there are some notable appearances from the movies as well - with the main inclusion being, of course, Indiana Jones himself, who serves as the game&#39;s main protagonist and playable character. At the time that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle takes place (between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade), Indiana is working as a professor at Marshall College before setting off on another adventure, and Great Circle&#39;s gameplay revolves mostly around his signature whip and adventuring skills.

Also returning from the Indiana Jones movies is (seemingly) the character Marcus Brody, one of Indiana Jones&#39; colleagues at Marshall College who appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. In the Developer_Direct trailer (via the Bethesda Softworks YouTube channel), Brody only makes a minor appearance in one scene where he advises Indy not to run from his problems, and it&#39;s currently unknown whether he will play a significant role in the story of the full game.




                  Does Harrison Ford Voice Indiana Jones In The Great Circle?   The upcoming video game, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, captures the likeness of Harrison Fordâ€™s adventure-loving Indiana in animation and voice.

Aside from Indiana Jones himself and the brief appearance of Marcus Brody, the showcase of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle also showed off some entirely new characters set to play major roles in the game&#39;s narrative. Serving as a secondary protagonist and ally is Gina, an investigative reporter with a &#34;personal stake&#34; in solving the mysteries of the game&#39;s main plot. Not much else has been revealed about Gina so far, but the Developer_Direct showcase has shown her to be one of Indiana&#39;s main allies in The Great Circle.





 

On the other hand, the main villain of the game has been revealed to be another new character - the &#34;intensely psychological&#34; Emmerich Voss, who has been teased as an intelligent villain able to get under Indy&#39;s skin and serve as a foil to him as well. The villain who sets off the inciting incident for the plot, however, isn&#39;t Voss, but an as yet unnamed character referred to as the &#34;mysterious giant,&#34; who kicks off the story of The Great Circle by breaking into Marshall College and stealing a historical artifact.

With only a vague release date of 2024, and the promise of more to show in the coming months, it&#39;s likely that the cast of The Great Circle will be rounded out with more new characters, and potentially even other cameos of characters from the movies as well. With a mix of old faces and new additions, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle looks to be balancing referential movie nostalgia with a compellingly original Indiana Jones story.
