## Literature Review

The Legendary Pokémon Iron Boulder is a rare creature you can find and catch in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC if you finish a quest.





Many new versions of old Legendary Pokémon have been added to the expanded content, including creatures like Gouging Fire in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. Iron Boulder is exclusive to Pokémon Violet and can only be acquired for Pokémon Scarlet through trading. The Rock-/Psychic-type resembling Terrakion spawns in Area Zero when you complete a specific NPC&#39;s quest.




                  Why You&#39;re Missing One New Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC   With one elusive final Pokémon to go, there&#39;s still an extra stretch for completionists before passing the finish line of The Indigo Disk DLC.   


 How To Unlock Iron Boulder in Pokémon Violet 
          

You unlock Iron Boulder in Pokémon Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC by registering 200 Pokémon in the Blueberry Pokédex. This objective becomes available after you finish the &#34;Bloodmon Ursulana&#34; quest in The Teal Mask DLC. Showing this character the completed Pokédex in the Savannah Rest Area causes them to show your character a picture of Iron Boulder for the first time.



Before you start The Indigo Disk DLC in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, try to complete as many quests from The Teal Mask as possible to have Perrin available to unlock Legendary Pokémon like Iron Boulder.







Showing you the picture allows you to find the Legendary Pokémon in Area Zero as you travel to the crater in this zone. Iron Boulder is found right below Research Station 2 in this area and can be fought immediately as you run into the beast. Make sure to stock up on supplies like Pokeballs or healing items to help your team endure a prolonged fight against the Sword of Justice variant in Pokémon Violet.

This version of Terrakion is Level 75 and has a measly 3.9% capture rate as you begin your battle with the creature. Have Pokémon on your team that can inflict status conditions such as Sleep and Paralysis to increase your chances of catching Iron Boulder. Injuring it to red health also helps, but be careful not to accidentally knock the Pokémon out since Pokémon Violet only has one Iron Boulder.

If you make the mistake of taking out Iron Boulder in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Violet, reload your previous save to try finding and catching this Legendary Pokémon once again.
