## Literature Review

Christmas Wordle is ready to be solved. We&#39;ve got hints, and the fully spoiled answer, if today&#39;s Wordle is giving you trouble.





For those that prefer a more challenging puzzle, like today&#39;s is, there are always Wordle copycats like Quordle which increase the difficulty of the game while keeping the spirit of the original. Quordle has players trying to solve four different Wordle words at the exact same time, all while sharing the same answers given by the player. Balancing each puzzle can be difficult but with the increased number of allowed guesses the game is still very possible to win.




                  Every Wordle Answer: All Words Used So Far (Updated Daily)   Wordle is a simple daily word game that has taken the internet by storm. With only 6 chances to get the right answer, players may need a little help.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
December 25th #919
          




The December 25th Wordle answer is EVOKE.

We had a tough go at today&#39;s puzzle but still ended up being successful. For our starting Wordle word we used IRATE which only provided a single correctly placed &#39;E&#39; at the end of the word. Moving forward we tried PLUME, this only knocked out a few more incorrect letters and didn&#39;t move us much closer to the answer.

For our third attempt, we tried CHOSE which helped a bit by locking in a new vowel with &#39;O&#39;. As the letters started to disappear we were really wracking our brain and tried GEODE as our fourth guess. This at least proved that there was a repeated &#39;E&#39; and set us forward to the correct answer.

Despite scoring this Wordle win-in-five with the correct answer, EVOKE, we spent a long time working the letters around and even trying words that didn&#39;t exist just to see if they might be correct. Either way, a win is a win and we&#39;ll keep our streak alive for one more day!
