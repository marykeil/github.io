## Literature Review

Some cantrips and level 1 spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are some of the most useful in the entire game, and players should keep an eye out for.




Being set in the fantasy world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers a plethora of spells for the party to make use of during their adventures. While there are some brilliant high level spells on offer later in the game, some of the most useful spells are actually quite low level. From providing an edge in combat to turning the battlefield to the party&#39;s advantage, these low level spells are the best ones to keep an eye out for.
Spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are organized by levels, just like in DnD, with the logic being the higher the level, the more powerful the spell. However, that isn&#39;t always the case, and certain spells are useful throughout the game right up until the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The spells here are all cantrips and level one spells that are available to the broadest number of spellcasters to make sure every party can have the opportunity to see their benefits.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.













 








 10  Faerie Fire - Level One Evocation Spell 
Bards, Druids, Light Domain Clerics, Archfey Warlocks, Drow/Half-Drow
        

Faerie Fire is a first level spell that is useful throughout a playthrough of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The spell sheds dim light for 10 turns, revealing all invisible creatures in the radius and giving the party advantage on attack rolls against them. At early levels having advantage against enemies can really come in handy as the party might not have too many magical items to boost their stats. Then at later stages of BG3 there are a surprising number of enemies who can turn invisible, which faerie fire can deal with every quickly.





 9  Magic Missile - Level One Evocation Spell 
Sorcerers, Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights, Lore Bards
        

Magic missile is a classic DnD spell that might not look like much, but it is always worth having to hand. At level one, this spell sends out three magical darts that each deal 1d4&#43;1 force damage to enemies with no need to roll for the attack. The fact that the darts are guaranteed to hit is what makes magic missile so useful, especially at higher levels where the number of darts increases. Magic missile come in handy in fights against enemies who are difficult to hit or have a mechanic which shields them in some way.
Magic missile is especially useful in the boss fight against Orin in Act 3 due to her Unstoppable Charges. 






 8  Feather Fall - Level One Transmutation Spell 
Bards, Sorcerers, Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights
        

Feather fall is a spell that, while highly situational in DnD, is much more useful in a video game setting such as BG3. This spell allows the spellcaster and allies within 9 meters to fall or leap from high places without taking fall damage. Feather fall is a bonus action that lasts for 10 turns and, best of all, can be cast out of combat as a ritual, meaning it does not use a spell slot.





 7  Grease - Level One Conjuration Spell 
Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights


 







Grease is an often overlooked spell in DnD that had come into its own in BG3. Grease does exactly what it sounds like, creating an area on the ground covered in grease. This area becomes difficult terrain, which means creatures move through it at half speed, with a chance to fall prone. This allows the party to better control the battlefield, creating choke points or keeping some enemies out of the fight for a turn if they fall
The grease created is flammable and pairs very well with the fire bolt cantrip. 






 6  Shocking Grasp - Evocation Cantrip 
Sorcerers, Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights
        

Shocking grasp is a great cantrip that not only deals damage but has an added bonus. Shocking grasp does decent damage, dealing 1d8 lightning damage that increases at levels five and 10, with an advantage on attack rolls against enemies in BG3 in metal armor. However, the best part of shocking gasp is that when it hits, it prevents the target from using their reaction for that turn, meaning squishier party members can move away afterward without risking an attack of opportunity.
            
 
 7 Best Alternate Uses For Spells In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a wide variety of spells, each with unique effects. Many of these have alternate uses in and out of combat encounters.









 5  Bone Chill - Necromancy Cantrip 
Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards, Circle O Spores Druids, Lore Bards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights, High Elves, High Half-Elves
        

Another great cantrip with a secondary effect better than its damage is bone chill. BG3&#39;s version of the DnD cantrip chill touch, bone chill deals 1d8 necrotic damage to targets, which increases at levels five and 10. As well as imposing disadvantage for attack rolls to undead targets, bone chill&#39;s best feature is that it prevents the target from healing until the spellcaster&#39;s next turn. This is especially useful against groups of enemies with a healer or powerful enemies who are healing themselves.





 4  Speak With Animals - Level One Divination Spell 
Bards, Druids, Nature Domain Clerics, Rangers, Wildheart Barbarians, Oath Of The Ancients Paladins, Forest Gnomes


 







Speak with animals is a fantastic spell in BG3 that can open up new quests and give insight into others. As the name suggests, the spell allows the cast to speak with and understand beasts. As a ritual spell speak with animals does not use a spell slot, unless cast when in combat, and lasts until a long rest. There are so many opportunities to use this spell throughout the game, leading to some of BG3&#39;s funniest moments.





 3  Create Or Destroy Water - Level One Transmutation Spell 
Clerics, Druids, Storm Sorcerers
        

At first glance, create or destroy water might not seem like a necessary combat spell; however, looks can be deceiving. Just as the name suggests, the spell can be used to destroy an area of water or create one, and both are useful in combat for similar reasons. Water adds the wet condition to creatures and makes them more susceptible to cold and lightning damage. Creating water allows the party to deal out damage over a larger area with few spells; making use of spell combos while destroying the water can stop enemies attempting to use this trick against the party.
Creating water can also come in handy against burning surfaces, as well as washing acid-based attacks off of the party. 






 2  Sanctuary - Level One Abjuration Spell 
Clerics, Oath Of Devotion Paladins, Lore Bards
        

Sanctuary is an often overlooked spell in BG3, which can make all the difference in difficult battles. When a spellcaster casts sanctuary on a target, that character cannot be targeted by enemies for attacks, although they can still take damage from AOE spells. Sanctuary is a concentration spell and can be ended prematurely if the target deals damage to another creature. This spell is perfect for keeping companions or NPCs safe during battle, such as Isobel in Act 2 or Shadowheart during the fight with Viconia.

 1  Guidance - Divination Cantrip 
Clerics, Druids


 







While guidance can&#39;t be used in combat, it is a spell that is useful all throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This cantrip grants a temporary 1d4 bonus to ability checks and can make the difference between passing the DC and failing at times. Guidance is easily the most used spell in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and with good reason, with unlimited use and zero downside to having a party member have it in their roster of spells.
