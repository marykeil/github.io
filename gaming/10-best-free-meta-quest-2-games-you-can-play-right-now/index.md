VR technology has become much more affordable over the past few years. As prices drop, more users than ever are picking up Meta Quest 2 or 3 headsets and looking for the best titles to get the most out of virtual reality gaming.

Players can find plenty of premium titles for even under $10, but there are lots of apps and games that are entirely free or free to play. Some of the best experiences on the Meta Quest 2 can be had with no monetary investment at all.

 10  Rec Room (2019) 
User-Created Games And Content
        

In the vein of ROBLOX, Rec Room is a social game based around user-generated content. Players create avatars and customize them with outfits and items. The best part is that Rec Room is cross-platform, so players can even play on their phones or PCs to interact with their friends and never miss a moment of fun.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   4.1/5    





 9  Ancient Dungeon Beta (2021) 
A Dungeon Crawling Rogue-Lite
        

Ancient Dungeon Beta takes a few cues from Minecraft, but that&#39;s not a bad thing. The pixelated graphics are simple but immersive, and the changing paths in the dungeon will keep players coming back over and over again. Combat is fast and frenetic, and the monsters are surprisingly deadly. The game is in full release now as a piece of paid software, but the beta version of Ancient Dungeon is still free to play and enjoy.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   5/5    





 8  Bait! (2019) 
Free And Relaxing VR Fishing


 







Bait! is a game that many players might gloss over. A VR fishing game doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s for everyone, but Bait! manages to craft an engaging and rewarding experience even for players who don&#39;t like fishing. This is partly due to the game not being entirely fishing, but also social experiences and treasure hunting. Players can race RC boats as well as skip stones and bounce beach balls with their friends. Users can choose from pre-made characters in Bait! or use their own Meta avatars, giving the game a more comfortable and personal feel.

 7  Gods of Gravity (2023) 
Single Or Multiplayer Real Time Strategy
        

Gods of Gravity is a real-time strategy on a cosmic scale. Gods compete by capturing and holding planets and moons, and in the end, an armada of ships gets sent to the other gods&#39; planets to conquer them. Players mine asteroids and fling ships and comets across space in a beautiful use of virtual reality technology. Multiplayer can get incredibly frantic when eight players are competing, rather than just two.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   4.2    





 6  X8 (2023) 
First-Person Hero Shooter


 







No VR library is complete without a running, jumping, first-person shooter. In X8, players take on the role of a unique hero with special abilities in this team-based 5v5 area battler. Players who like Overwatch or Valorant will feel right at home jumping into X8&#39;s reality. Users can customize loadouts so even with unique abilities and playstyles, X8 will continue to feel fresh.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   5/5    





 5  Gym Class - Basketball VR (2022) 
NBA-Licensed Courts And Teams
        

The physics engine in Gym Class - Basketball VR is spot on and easy enough to handle that even players without any sports experience can enjoy it. There are single and multiplayer modes, from 2v2 to 4v4, and lots of customization to help each avatar stand out. The physics can take a little time to get used to, even compared to other VR titles, especially when dunking and leaping for the first time. Players with motion sickness or balance issues might want to steer clear, but Gym Class is a top-tier free game for the Meta Quest.

 4  Gravity Sketch (2019) 
Draw, Sculpt, And Model In 3D
        

Players can enter their own virtual reality art studio in Gravity Sketch. In addition to being able to draw and sketch in mid-air, users can also model amazing creations and collaborate with colleagues or friends to produce professional-quality work. They can also connect with LandingPad, a cloud solution for storing Gravity Sketch creations, to share the content at any point.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   4/5    





 3  Population: One (2020) 
Free-To-Play First-Person Battle Royale
        

Where X8 is most appealing for Overwatch and Valorant fans, Population: One is going to be the most familiar and comfortable to Fortnite players. A battle royale in virtual reality where players can build, fly, and climb, the number of game modes for Population: One is impressive. Not only can players join into the traditional huge sandbox arena with dozens of other players, but they can also play smaller 12v12 matches or even 3v3v3v3 team modes. Best of all, players can hone their skills against training bots and co-op with their friends to blast the same bots down before going into the royale for real.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   4.1/5    





 2  Cards &amp; Tankards (2023) 
Collectible Card Game And Deck Building


 







No doubt inspired by Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering Arena, Cards &amp; Tankards is a free-to-play CCG for the Meta Quest. Players sit in a virtual tavern to cast spells, use abilities from their decks, and watch the actions play out in 3D on the tabletop. Like all free-to-play CCGs, there are in-game purchases that cater to the whales who spend exorbitant amounts to always be at the cutting edge. However, even free players can accomplish a lot in Cards &amp; Tankards, since all of the game&#39;s cards can be collected without spending any money at all.
  Critic   Score    Quest Store   4.2    





 1  Gorilla Tag (2022) 
Play Tag, Hunt, and Paintball as Gorillas
        

In one of the most unique and fun experiences on Meta Quest, Gorilla Tag succeeds at delivering exactly what the title promises. Users will don a colorful gorilla avatar and play tag. The game has six levels for players to explore, and even if they&#39;re not feeling like romping and climbing around the world, Gorilla Tag has private rooms where friends can just hang out. Movement happens through easy-to-learn arm movements, and it doesn&#39;t take long to figure out how to bounce and climb all over the place. Plus, there is crossplay between the Quest version and PC, so everyone can play together all the time.
