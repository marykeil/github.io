# Miles Morales Doesn t Need Another Spin-Off Game (Even If He Deserves It)


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 doesn&#39;t need to lead into another spin-off game like Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.   Adding another Marvel game to its development itinerary would keep Insomniac Games from using its talent diversely.   Another Miles spin-off game would be great, but his story can be given the attention it deserves in Spider-Man 2 DLC and the expected Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3.

## Literature Review

Miles Morales has a story that&#39;s worth telling, but Insomniac shouldn&#39;t make another Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man spin-off game in order to tell it.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 seems like it could be a great set up for a sequel to the spin-off game Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but it actually might be best for the side game to remain a one-off venture. Insomniac&#39;s superhero franchise started with a focus on Peter Parker while building up Miles as a second Spider-Man, which paid off big-time through their shared spotlight in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. It&#39;s possible to have too much of a good thing, however, and throwing a Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales 2 into the mix is a recipe for just that.




The potential for a Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales 2 is best supported by the place where Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 leaves the story. Steering clear of explicit spoilers, it seems like some time might have to pass before Peter will be game to take on major threats again. Without anything to cover the ground in between, this would either make a significant time gap necessary before Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3, or force the game to start slow on the Peter side of things. Even though Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales 2 could bridge this gap, it&#39;s worth considering some other consequences.


 Insomniac Shouldn&#39;t Only Make Marvel Games 
The Studio&#39;s Talent Deserves Diverse Applications
          

The biggest issue with a possible Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales 2 lies simply in the pitfalls of ballooning the franchise any further, as locking Insomniac into doing one thing and one thing only could deprive the market of other great games it could make. The company has a long pedigree of excellent titles, from the long-running Ratchet &amp; Clank series to games like Resistance and Sunset Overdrive. Web-slinging does make for great gameplay, but putting all of its eggs into one basket leaves little room for Insomniac to experiment with new concepts or bring back defunct franchises that still have more to offer.




Even without Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales 2 on the map, it&#39;s clear that Marvel will be a key part of Insomniac&#39;s future, with Marvel&#39;s Wolverine having been officially announced and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 being generally assumed to be in the works. With a couple of games on the horizon, it still seems feasible that the coming years could hold another Ratchet &amp; Clank or another non-superhero title. Expanding the roster to three makes it hard to envision a schedule for the near future where Insomniac releases much of anything else in that time frame, which arguably isn&#39;t a price worth paying to see more of Miles.

                  Why Wolverine Isn&#39;t In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Setting Up The Next Insomniac Game   Prior to Spider-Man 2&#39;s launch, many had speculated that the title would set up Insomniac&#39;s Wolverine game, however, this was not the case.   



 Future-Proofing Would Be Good For Insomniac 
Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man Won&#39;t Last Forever
          




Making the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games has obviously been an abundantly worthwhile endeavor for Insomniac, with glowing reception and excellent sales serving to bolster the studio&#39;s already strong reputation. All the same, few franchises last forever, and taking the opportunity to try out new things while the company is on top could help Insomniac prepare for the future. The superhero craze of the past decade or so has already started to wane at the box office, and although declining interest in the Marvel films certainly didn&#39;t hurt Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, no cultural moment can last forever.

Taking time off from a major cash cow to try a new direction has plenty of precedent in game development history, and although not every venture is successful, some have proven to be incredibly worthwhile investments. To take another studio of comparable size and scale as an example, turning from Uncharted&#39;s thrills to slower-paced gameplay with The Last of Us could be seen as a risk that paid off for Naughty Dog. Having a little break between Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and 3 can also help build anticipation for the new one, as even the thrills of web-slinging can wear off if they become a constant occupation.






 Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC Could Bridge The Gap 
Miles Doesn&#39;t Need A Standalone Game To Fight Crime
          

It might not be fair to shortchange Miles&#39;s story based on wanting Insomniac to diversify its output, but that wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be the case. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC could be the perfect solution, focusing in on a smaller story than Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales did while laying the groundwork for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3. Since the major initial trial of adjusting to the superhero lifestyle doesn&#39;t have to be addressed this time, it should be possible to tell a complete narrative that can bridge the gap without stretching to a full-length runtime.

Releasing further Miles adventures as DLC also manages expectations for new features and transformative elements, potentially saving Insomniac time on development compared to a standalone release. Although the first Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales wasn&#39;t entirely transformative, it did lean into Miles&#39;s new abilities, and the bar has been raised higher than ever with the overhauls that Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 made to gameplay and graphics while significantly expanding the environment. Doing a reasonably sized three-episode DLC like the first game&#39;s, but focusing it on Miles makes for a perfect compromise.

 Miles&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man Future Is In Good Hands 
Insomniac Knows How To Treat Miles Morales
         

Miles Morales is a great character, and arguing that he shouldn&#39;t receive another standalone game could come across as a dismissal of just how much he has to offer. Insomniac has been careful about building up his story, however, and everything seems poised to give him his biggest role ever in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3. Should Insomniac choose to skip out on a Miles Morales sequel, there&#39;s no reason to imagine that the studio wouldn&#39;t deliver a story that can satisfy his fans while possibly wrapping up a trilogy with a bow.




                  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Answers Who&#39;s The Best Spider-Man, Miles Morales Or Peter Parker   Miles Morales and Peter Parker share the spotlight in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, and the game reveals that one is capable of outdoing the other.   

Focusing Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 on Miles would also make it more likely that everyone gets to see the most important parts of his narrative, as the main series is likely to attract a wider audience than any spin-offs. There&#39;s ultimately no reason that sticking to one more Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man game couldn&#39;t do justice to Miles&#39; story, and there&#39;s so much that Insomniac could have to offer besides this one franchise. Miles Morales certainly deserves to have a complete arc and proper closure following Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but he doesn&#39;t need another spin-off game for that to happen.
