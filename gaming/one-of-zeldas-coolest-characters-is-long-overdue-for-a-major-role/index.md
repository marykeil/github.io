# One Of Zeldas Coolest Characters Is Long Overdue For A Major Role


## SUMMARY 



  A mysterious and intriguing character could be the perfect final boss in a Zelda game with darker tones and an eerie style.   The ability to copy Link&#39;s skills and improved AI technology would make for a challenging and dynamic boss fight.   Centering the game&#39;s story around Link and making Dark Link the main antagonist would allow Zelda to play a more direct and significant role in supporting the hero.

## Literature Review

Although Zelda includes a variety of villains throughout decades of games, they don’t receive the same attention. And one is overdue for a major role.




The Legend of Zelda has featured a wide variety of bosses over its decades of game releases, and it&#39;s common for bosses to be included in multiple games, given how the timeline works with the repeated rebirths of Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf. Naturally, bosses like Ganondorf, his beast form Ganon, and Demise receive the most attention out of every boss that appears throughout the series. However, there are other bosses that deserve the spotlight in a future Zelda title.




Because Ganondorf is tied to Zelda and Link through the Triforce as the person who carries the Triforce of Power, it makes sense that he makes plenty of appearances as the final boss. However, the mini-bosses that Link encounters in dungeons and shrines can often play important roles in fleshing out the world of Zelda and the history of Hyrule. That&#39;s why it&#39;s time for a new final villain after Zelda: BOTW and TOTK.

 Dark Link As The Next Main Villain In Zelda 
Dark Link Was Last A Boss In OoT
          

Dark Link appears in several Zelda games, but he&#39;s the final boss only in Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. Aside from that, he&#39;s a sub-boss in the Water Temple in Ocarina of Time, and he makes small appearances in other games, usually in optional challenges. However, Dark Link is a fascinating and mysterious character who would be the perfect final boss in a game that has darker tones and an eerie style similar to Majora&#39;s Mask, where grief is an overarching theme.






Dark Link also makes an appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee.




As the evil reflection of Link, Dark Link creates an opportunity for Zelda to take an introspective look at Link. Always being put in the role of the hero could be taxing. Doubting himself or lacking confidence could be the difference between life and death for many of the battles that Link has to fight. Putting Dark Link in the role of final boss makes Link his own worst enemy and opens up the chance to explore what happens when the hero becomes the biggest threat to Hyrule.



 How Dark Link Would Be A Challenging Boss 
Dark Link Copies Link&#39;s Skills
         

Even in Ocarina of Time, Dark Link is a difficult fight because he copies Link&#39;s skill set. Technology has only improved since OoT&#39;s creation, so the AI that could be used for a Dark Link fight would make it even harder than it was in the past. The nature of Dark Link also makes it possible to have multiple encounters with him throughout the duration of the game. That setup could give each encounter a different level of difficulty, having both Link and Dark Link grow in power between their battles. In that way, the game feels more alive because Dark Link will only grow in power over time.

Dark Link, as a reflection of Link, also opens the opportunity for random battles against him during the game, similar to invasions in Soulslike games but with AI. This could add a sense of apprehension to the game if there&#39;s no knowing when Dark Link, or perhaps a fragment of him, will appear and challenge Link. As a result, the developers could explore genres that Zelda doesn&#39;t typically include, such as psychological thrillers.



 Putting The Focus On Link Instead Of Zelda 
Dark Link Is A Reflection Of Link
          

Although Link is always the playable character in Zelda and plays an integral role in the story, the game&#39;s usually not about him. At least, they are not about him as a character but about what he can do for Hyrule. Therefore, centering a game&#39;s story around Link presents chances to take unique looks at him as a character, and that changes the roles that other characters play, particularly Zelda. As the princess of Hyrule, Zelda&#39;s often unable to help Link as directly as she&#39;d like. In some cases, she&#39;s unable to help him beyond messages, like with Dragon Tear memories in Zelda: TOTK.




With Link as the main target of the villain, Zelda has the potential to contribute more directly to handling Dark Link compared to other games. Depending on how well Dark Link blends in, Zelda&#39;s attitude towards the real Link could change in this circumstance, especially if she&#39;s unable to tell the difference between them. The shifting dynamics between characters could create an atmosphere like Termina in Majora&#39;s Mask, where the residents are familiar because they&#39;re doppelgängers of Hyrule residents. But there&#39;s a sense of unease because, even though the characters look the same, they&#39;re entirely different people.



 Dark Link Could Change The Main Character 
Zelda Could Take The Spotlight
          

If Dark Link is the main boss, then Zelda could take the role of main character instead of Link. Of course, this possibility would depend a lot on the story and how Dark Link manifests. And Link&#39;s state during these events would play a large part in who ends up being the main character and, therefore, how much Zelda directly contributes to the story. Or if Zelda ends up being more of a support for Link during his battle with Dark Link, possibly handling damage control depending on what Dark Link does in Hyrule and what his end goals could be.

Changing the formula to have Dark Link as the villain and Zelda as the hero might be a welcome shift after two games in a row, putting Ganon and Ganondorf as the final bosses. Even putting Dark Link as a sub-villain instead of the main villain brings opportunities with it without putting Zelda as the hero, and Link having to overcome his own darkness seems rather fitting given that he holds the Triforce of Courage and needs to take on the greatest evils that plague Hyrule. It&#39;d be natural that he has some doubts about his own abilities that take the form of Dark Link as a sub-boss before he can challenge the main boss properly.

While Ganondorf is a classic Zelda villain, there are other villains from the past who deserve another chance to be in the spotlight. Dark Link, a fascinating reflection of Link, has plenty of potential, but he&#39;s been largely left in the shadows since his second boss appearance in OoT. And he was a sub-boss that time instead of the final boss. Bringing Dark Link back in a major role can do a lot to shake up the standard formula in the next The Legend of Zelda.
