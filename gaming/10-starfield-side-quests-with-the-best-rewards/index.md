# 10 Starfield Side Quests With The Best Rewards


## SUMMARY 


Starfield
 has many side quests that can be entirely skipped and are easily missed. 
 Some of the game&#39;s greatest rewards, however, come from side quests, rather than the game&#39;s main missions. 
 Traveling through the Settled Systems and beyond, helping NPCs with their myriad problems can result in being rewarded with new ships, unique weapons, surprising companions, and more.

## Literature Review

Starfield has an incredible amount of side quests, all of which are effectively optional, but a handful have particularly great rewards.




Starfield has an incredible number of planets scattered throughout roughly 100 star systems, which combine to offer a host of excellent quests, many of which are easy to miss as they are non-essential side quests. Despite being unnecessary for completing the game, many of Starfield&#39;s side quests are among its greatest, most entertaining, and most immersive stories in the game. Perhaps the best element of many of these side quests, however, is the exceptional rewards they offer the player.
Like many of Bethesda&#39;s games, quest rewards often come in the form of XP, Credits, and resources, but many of the best side quests in Starfield offer the player so much more. These unnecessary but excellent side quests reward the player with potential relationships and companions, unique weapons, armor sets, and even, in some cases, ships. Starfield&#39;s Settled Systems and the worlds beyond are vast, and certain side quests result in items and companions that should not be skipped.

 10  Divided Loyalties 
Andreja Companion Quest
        

&#34;Divided Loyalties&#34; is one of Starfield&#39;s many relationship quests, begun by reaching a certain affinity level with Andreja. The side quest to romance Andreja revolves around reconciling her with her old friends Eren and Jaeda, whom she abandoned years prior during an attack from Va&#39;ruun Zealots. After doing so successfully, Andreja will express her affection for the player character. Successfully completing the side quest &#34;Divided Loyalties&#34; will unlock the option to have Andreja as a romantic partner, and will reward the player with 250 XP and 6,200 Credits.
Affinity levels of companions cannot normally be checked in-game, and are only accessible via the command console on PC. However, speaking to companions regularly will give the player a general idea of their affinity level.

 9  In Memoriam 
Sarah Morgan Companion Quest
        

&#34;In Memoriam&#34; is another one of Starfield&#39;s key compaanion side quests, this one revolving around Sarah Morgan. As players converse with Sarah and raise her affinity level, she will begin speaking about her past, and take the player on several adventures across Cassiopea I. &#34;In Memoriam&#34; is one of the game&#39;s more emotionally charged quests, and culminates in an intimate discussion on New Atlantis, in which players can broach the subject of romance, or decide to stay friends with Sarah. Successfully finishing the side quest will unlock the option to have Sarah as a partner, and provide the player with 250 XP and 11,500 Credits.

 8  Red Tape Reclamation 
Started In Cydonia
        

&#34;Red Tape Reclamation&#34; is among the easiest of quests in Starfield, but it involves the compelling plight of miners on Mars, and has pretty great rewards, especially if completed early in the game. The simple side quest takes place in Cydonia, and tasks the player with retrieving stolen mining equipment. Successfully having the purloined equipment returned to its rightful owner, and completing &#34;Red Tape Reclamation&#34; will see the player rewarded with 100 XP, 9,000 Credits, Deimos helmet, spacesuit, cap, and backpack, and 50 Iron.
  &#34;Red Tape Reclamation&#34; Rewards    Deimos helmet, spacesuit, cap, and backpack    50 Iron    9,000 Credits    100 XP    





 7  Leader Of The Pack 
Started In Akila City
        

&#34;Leader of the Pack&#34; is the final side quest in a trio beginning with &#34;Defensive Measures.&#34; Taking place outside the monster-threatened Akila City, &#34;Leader of the Pack&#34; sees the player accompany Davis Wilson in search of a deadly Alpha Ashta. The side quest&#39;s objective is to defeat the Alpha Ashta, with a bonus objective for ensuring Wilson survives the encounter. In addition to 100 XP and 4,800 Credits, completing the side quest &#34;Leader of the Pack&#34; will award the player a deadly weapon, a unique sniper rifle called the Despondent Assassin.
Wilson&#39;s survival does not affect the rewards for &#34;Leader of the Pack.&#34; The Despondent Assassin is earned regardless of whether or not the bonus objective is completed. 

  &#34;Leader of the Pack&#34; Rewards    Despondant Assassin (Unique Old Earth Hunting Rifle)    100 XP    4,800 Credits    





 6  Overdesigned 
Started In The Lodge (New Atlantis)


 







One of the best elements in Starfield is the ability to design a custom ship, and the side quest &#34;Overdesigned&#34; takes complete advantage of this gameplay mechanic, allowing the player to create a Kepler-type ship as a member of the R&amp;D team of Stroud-Eklund. Following the completion of the side quest, depending upon the player&#39;s decisions, the player will be rewarded with either a Kepler R ship or a Kepler S ship, as well as 200 XP and 8,500 Credits.
  &#34;Overdesigned&#34; Rewards    Kepler R or Kepler S ship (dependent on choices made during the quest)    200 XP    8,500 Credits

 5  Run The Red Mile 
Started On Porrima III
        

&#34;Run the Red Mile&#34; is one of the most entertaining side quests in Starfield. Located on the planet Porrima III, &#34;Run the Red Mile&#34; revolves around an illegal racetrack. After entering the tournament, the player will need to survive and win to receive a number of rewards. In addition to 200 XP and 3,300 Credits, completing the &#34;Run the Red Mile&#34; will get the player an exceptional reward: a unique variant of the Pacifier named Brute Force, one of the best shotguns in Starfield. Furthermore, completing the Red Mile will unlock it for free play, and winning an additional 28 times will unlock another unique weapon, Desperation.
  &#34;Run the Red Mile&#34; Rewards    Brute Force (Unique Pacifier)    200 XP    3,300 Credits    





 4  Groundpounder 
Started By Visiting Aranae IV-A Or Entering The Altair System
        

&#34;Groundpounder&#34; can begin in a couple of ways, both of which have the player learning of a distress signal originating in the Altair system. Responding to the call, players become embroiled in a conflict on Altair II, in which the typically-at-odds United Colonies and Freestar Collective find themselves aligned against Spacers assaulting a research station. The story interestingly leverages Starfield&#39;s interstellar politics for an exciting quest that involves fighting through the research facility, liberating a Spacer-infested camp, and dogfighting in space. The expected rewards of XP and Credits are doled out alongside the Peacekeeper, one of Starfield&#39;s best rifles, upon completing &#34;Groundpounder.&#34;
  &#34;Groundpounder&#34; Rewards    Peacekeeper (Unique AA-99)    300 XP    5,000 Credits    





 3  A Legacy Forged 
Started In New Atlantis


 







&#34;A Legacy Forged&#34; is the final mission for the UC Vanguard faction questline in Starfield. As the name may suggest, it&#39;s a side quest that compels the player to make difficult decisions – the fate of Vae Victis, aka François Sanon, and the handling of the Terrormorph threat. Unlike most other quests in Starfield, this one does not involve combat or exploration, merely simple discussions and one almost impossible decision. Following the conclusion of the side quest, the player will receive some exceptional rewards – Class One Citizenship in the United Colonies, 22,000 Credits, 350 XP, a New Atlantis penthouse, and a permanent reduction in the price of purchases made in the Colonies.
  &#34;A Legacy Forged&#34; Rewards    Class One UC Citizenship    New Atlantis Penthouse    Shopping discount in the United Colonies    350 XP    22,000 Credits    





 2  Eye Of The Storm 
Started On The Key
        

Starfield&#39;s myriad quests thrive when completing those related to the game&#39;s major factions, and &#34;Eye of the Storm&#34; is the dramatic penultimate chapter of the player&#39;s undercover work for UC SysDef infiltrating the Crimson Fleet. The entire quest is quite long, but players will eventually have to choose which faction to side with. Generally, siding with the Crimson Fleet will lead to disapproval from companions, but both routes offer similar, great rewards, which are locked in by the player&#39;s decision in &#34;Eye of the Storm&#34; and dispensed after completing the subsequent, far more brief quest, &#34;Legacy&#39;s End.&#34;
  &#34;Eye of the Storm&#34; UC SysDef Rewards   &#34;Eye of the Storm&#34; Crimson Fleet Rewards    Continued access to the Vigilance &amp; its mission board   Continued access to the Key &amp; Crimson Fleet mission boards    Option to get Tempest (Unique Tombstone) &amp; Delgado&#39;s apparel   Option to get Unfair Advantage (Unique Razorback)    SysDef Formal Uniform   Option to recruit Mathis as a companion    350 XP   350 XP    250,000 Credits   250,000 Credits    
            
 
 Starfield: Should You Side With The Crimson Fleet or Sys Def? 
Starfield’s conflict between the UC and Crimson Fleet factions eventually comes to a head, and you have to pick a side. But which one is better?








 1  Operation Starseed 
Started By Entering The Charybdis System


 







&#34;Operation Starseed&#34; is a particularly interesting quest which revolves around the player traveling to a settlement on the planet of Charybdis III, which is inhabited by three Societies – the Believers, Pragmatists, and the Renegade. Each group is led by a clone of a historical figure – Queen Amanirenas, Franklin Roosevelt, and Genghis Khan, respectively. The settlement is also home to other historical figures, some of whom are not what they seem. Completion of &#34;Operation Starseed&#34; will reward the player 300 XP, a sum of Credits dependent on the player&#39;s dialog choices, one of the three leaders&#39; outfits, and a clone of Amelia Earhart as a new companion.
  &#34;Operation Starseed&#34; Rewards    Queen Amanerinas&#39; outfit, Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s outfit, or Genghis Khan&#39;s outfit    Amelia Earhart as a companion    300 XP    2,000–6,000 Credits    
&#34;Operation Starseed&#34; leans into the wackier side of Bethesda&#39;s writing that typically comes through in the Fallout series. It&#39;s a refreshingly odd quest to stumble into amid Starfield&#39;s usually self-serious setting. The Credits payout isn&#39;t quite as large as that of &#34;Eye of the Storm,&#34; but &#34;Operation Starseed&#34; has by far the most novel rewards in Starfield&#39;s side quests, thanks to its historical outfits, and the ability to recruit legendary aviator Amelia Earhart.
