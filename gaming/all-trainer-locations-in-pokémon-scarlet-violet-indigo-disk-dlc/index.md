## Literature Review

There are several new NPC trainers in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, including strong League Club members, hidden in the terrarium.





Though battling every trainer in the terrarium is unnecessary to complete the Indigo Disk DLC, it can be a great way to strengthen your Pokémon before fighting the BB Elite Four and Kieran. Additionally, once a set number of trainers in a specific biome have been defeated, players can receive BP. Several trainers scattered throughout will also be League Club members. These trainers are more challenging than the normal ones players will encounter, and the color of their speech bubbles can identify them. 






Normal NPC trainers will have white chat bubbles above them, while League Club members will have a black speech bubble with a gold border.

 All Savanna Biome Trainer Locations 
          

The Savanna Biome is the easiest to spot NPC trainers, as there are none in caves, and the entire biome is generally flat and wide open. Of the 14 trainers in this Biome in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk, only 2 of them will be League Club members. Though they are spaced out across the entire biome, most trainers can be found and battled easily if players go directly from the terrarium entrance to the Central Plaza, as that is where most of them reside. Following that, players can circle back for the stragglers they missed.

 All Canyon Biome Trainer Locations 
          

The Canyon Biome is one of the most difficult to navigate due to the large cave system and scattered cliffs, so it&#39;s important to keep an eye out while looking for trainers, and it&#39;s recommended that players use the flying ability in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk, as it can make it significantly easier. Otherwise, try to reach high ground and glide to get an overview of the area. There will be 6 League Club members to battle in the Canyon Biome, primarily in caves.

 All Polar Biome Trainer Locations 
          

The Polar Biome has the most trainers, with a total of 16, including two hidden inside caves. Note that the caves in this area connect to the ones in the Canyon Biome, so keep an eye on the mini-map to determine if you&#39;ve accidentally crossed over to another biome. Finally, 5 of the 16 trainers in this area will be League Club members who will be more challenging to defeat but also offer greater rewards that can be used to further progress in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.

                  Pokémon Indigo Disk&#39;s Map Size Compared To Teal Mask DLC &amp; Paldea Region   The Indigo Disk is a substantial addition to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and it&#39;s interesting to see just how it stacks up against what came before.   



 All Coastal Biome Trainer Locations 
          

Since about 50% of the Coastal Biome is water, this greatly reduces the surface search area for trainers in this biome. Note that 2 of the trainers in this area will be found inside the small cave system, and 4 of the 15 trainers in this area will be the remaining League Club members. Don&#39;t forget to check in with the NPC hanging around the rest stops in each biome as they offer rewards for defeating trainers in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC.
