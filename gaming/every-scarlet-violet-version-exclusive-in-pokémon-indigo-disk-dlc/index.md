## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC doubles the number of version exclusives compared to The Teal Mask, and it&#39;s helpful to know the full list.




The new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC features a variety of exciting Pokémon to catch, but which ones are available can vary a little depending on what version of the base game the DLC is added to. As with all Pokémon games, the split nature of the release offers unique perks in each edition, and these carry over to the singular version of Indigo Disk. Neither lineup is necessarily better than the other, but one could end up being more preferable if it contains more favorites.




The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is a bigger experience than the Teal Mask expansion that preceded it, with a greater variety of NPCs, a longer runtime, and a more climactic story to wrap up the Scarlet and Violet narrative experience. It&#39;s consequently no surprise that the exclusive Pokémon offerings are likewise more substantial in The Indigo Disk&#39;s Pokédex, even if it&#39;s still not an especially long list. While The Teal Mask had a total of six version-exclusive Pokémon, with three attached to Scarlet and three to Violet, The Indigo Disk doubles that to a total of 12 version exclusives that splits evenly for six in each.

Pokémon Scarlet&#39;s lineup of version exclusives for The Indigo Disk DLC features several different Pokémon types, with each of three basic Pokémon featuring an evolution as well. Alolan Vulpix and Alolan Ninetales represent the Ice type, with Ninetales branching out into Fairy as well. Cranidos and Rampardos make their Rock-type presence known with dinosaur-like forms perfect for head-butting. The Fire/Dragon-type Gouging Fire and its Electric/Dragon-type evolution Raging Bolt are new introductions for The Indigo Disk that can only be found with a copy of Pokémon Scarlet.

Pokémon Violet&#39;s The Indigo Disk version exclusives follow a similar format to Scarlet&#39;s, with two Alolan variants, two general Pokémon, and two new introductions. Alolan Sandshrew and Alolan Sandslash represent the Ice/Steel type, and Shieldon and Bastiodon are Rock/Steel inclusions. The original exclusives for Pokémon Violet owners playing The Indigo Disk are Iron Boulder and Iron Crown, which are Rock/Psychic and Steel/Pyschic types respectively.

It&#39;s hard to go wrong with either of these selections, so having a fear of missing out based on owning either copy of the game shouldn&#39;t be a major concern. If a favorite happens to be locked to the other version, trading is always an option as long as both parties can make a fair contribution to the deal. The Indigo Disk DLC still contains a much smaller number of version exclusives than the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet base games, but it advances over The Teal Mask &#39;s version exclusives with a solid line-up for each copy.
