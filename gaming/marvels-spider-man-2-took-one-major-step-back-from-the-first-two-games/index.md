# Marvels Spider-Man 2 Took One Major Step Back From The First Two Games


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has improved in many ways, but the number of gadgets available has been reduced, which may disappoint fans of the previous games.   The gadgets in Spider-Man 2 are better suited for combat scenarios, which may not appeal to players who prefer stealth gameplay.   While abilities can be swapped around and customized, the same cannot be done with gadgets, which feels like a missed opportunity for players to tailor their gameplay experience.

## Literature Review

Spider-Man 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessors in many ways, but it can feel like the newest entry has taken a step back in one key area.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessors in many ways, with a larger map, faster traversal, a game-changing fast-travel system, and the ability to swap between both Peter Parker and Miles Morales&#39; Spider-Men. However, for those who played the previous titles in Insomniac Games&#39; acclaimed superhero series, it can feel like the newest entry has taken a step back in one specific area: the game&#39;s gadgets.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2]

Insomniac has streamlined the combat system in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 so that players can simply press one of the shoulder buttons and any of the face buttons on the PS5&#39;s DualSense controller for special moves. Using L1 and a face button activates one of Peter or Miles&#39; unique special abilities, such as Miles&#39; bioelectric &#34;Venom&#34;- not to be confused with the symbiotic villain of the sequel - or Peter&#39;s symbiote powers, and pressing R1 and a face button uses one of the duo&#39;s shared array of gadgets.

  


 Spider-Man 2 Has Fewer Gadgets 
          




Unfortunately, in order to streamline this system, there are fewer gadgets available in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and the radial Gadget Select menu of the previous games has been removed. Web Shooters are the default for tapping R1 on its own, and there are only four others which are activated with the face buttons. The Web Grabber pulls enemies and items toward each other, Ricochet Web will bounce between multiple targets, Concussion Burst emits a powerful sonic wave and is particularly useful when taking on Symbiotes later in the game, and Upshot is a small drone-type device that blasts enemies into the air.

The L1 abilities system was introduced in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales as a way to explore his new unique Venom abilities, and that game did have fewer gadgets when compared to the amount in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. This made sense as Peter was supposed to be the more tech-based of the two heroes after spending more years as Spider-Man developing new gadgets to assist him with different villains or scenarios. In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, however, Insomniac Games has tried to put the two hero on equal footing in many ways, with the same amount of abilities, gadgets and suits available for each, which feels like a step back for the more experienced of the two.

 Spider-Man 2&#39;s Gadgets Are Better For Combat 
          

While all of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s gadgets do compliment each other and are great for taking out larger groups of opponents quickly when chained together, they are tailored more for combat scenarios, meaning that stealth players may not find themselves needing them much. The game did add the new Web Line tool for stealth, which let players create their own paths instead of relying on set points like perches or beams above enemies. Combining several Web Lines could almost spin a giant web to reel cocooned foes up into, but it does feel like this would have been even greater when combined with some of the previous games&#39; gadgets.






Web Lines can be activated by holding L2, targeting a wall and pressing Triangle.




Part of stealth gameplay in previous games involved using gadgets such as the Web Mine to set traps for enemies before luring them in with a well-placed web shot on a crate, wall or floor. The Web Mine would then take the enemy down instantly by webbing them to whatever surface the gadget was placed on. Unfortunately, the Web Mine was removed from Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. It&#39;s likely that this gadget was replaced with the new Web Grabber, which was demonstrated in a stealth scenario in the game&#39;s May 2023 PlayStation Showcase gameplay footage. This footage showed Miles using the Web Line to move above a group of enemies, and deploy the Web Grabber to pull several enemies into one spot before dropping down from the line and using his Venom abilities to defeat them.






The Web Grabber will not defeat enemies instantly like the Web Mine, it will just stun them.




The problem with this is that the moment he did so, he was detected, as the Venom blasts aren&#39;t particularly stealthy by nature. Miles then had to use his Chain Lightning ability to stun the remaining enemies before defeating them in combat. While this was designed to demonstrate the abilities and gadgets working in tandem and looked impressive in the demonstration, it&#39;s not so great for those who want to complete an entire level such as the game&#39;s Hunter Blinds or Hunter Bases completely undetected.

                  All Hunter Blinds Locations In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   Hunter Blinds are staging points for Kraven&#39;s sinister plans in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. It&#39;s up to Peter and Miles to take them and their bases out.    



 Abilities Can Be Swapped Around, But Not Gadgets 
          




As Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s story progresses, Peter and Miles unlock a variety of new abilities. Miles&#39; bioelectrical powers evolve to be more powerful, with a new blue lightning emitting from him rather than yellow as he uses them. Meanwhile, Peter goes from using the mechanical arms he built based on his work with Otto Octavius, to using the Venom symbiote&#39;s powers, and ultimately, the Anti-Venom abilities. While only four of these abilities can be allocated at once - one for each of the controller&#39;s face buttons - they can be swapped out for those who want more variety, blending some of Peter&#39;s tech arm abilities with his most destructive symbiote ones to get the best of both worlds.

With this in mind, it feels like an odd omission for the Gadgets system not to work in a similar way, with all of Peter and Miles&#39; gadgets from previous games being unlockable in the menu before players allocate custom-builds to the face buttons for each hero. For example, with Miles&#39; camouflage abilities, players may opt for more of a stealth build for the character, whereas Peter&#39;s could be more combat-focused to align with his symbiotic rage. Alternatively, players could have the same build across both heroes, but could just pick one that suits their preferred play style.




Gadgets have always been a popular part of the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games. While removing the radial menu does speed up accessing them and allow players to quickly swap between all four of the ones available in quicker succession to build up some impressive combos, it does feel strange that so many were removed to enable this, especially with Peter&#39;s tendency to tinker with technology. Hopefully more of the fan-favorite gadgets will be added to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 in future updates or DLC and players can tailor their loadouts for a wider variety of different tactics going forward.
