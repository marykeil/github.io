## Literature Review

Finding the Strange Battery in Risk of Rain Returns is a challenge in and of itself, but figuring out what it does can be equally difficult.





Risk of Rain Returns is another great roguelike game similar to Hades, in that players will restart over and over to unlock all the content and find all the secrets. It is also a remake of the original game, following Risk of Rain 2 that reviewed quite positively. To earn one of the hidden secrets, players will also have to find the Strange Battery and figure out what it does.




                  Risk of Rain 2 - Survivors of The Void DLC Review: Into A Beautiful Void   Risk of Rain 2&#39;s Survivors of the Void DLC introduces the Railgunner and the Void Fiend characters and new stages to explore for countless hours.   


 Finding &amp; Using The Strange Battery In Risk Of Rain Returns 
          

First, to find the Strange Battery, you must play on Drizzle difficulty. While this is the easier difficulty in Risk of Rain Returns, it also gives players enough time to find the Strange Battery and make it to the end of the stage. Players will want to make it to the second to last stage (Stage 5) to get the Strange Battery.



There are three difficulty options to choose from when you begin a new run: Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon. However, within a run, the game will scale in difficulty the longer a player takes. The difficulty options modify how quickly this scales up to the more difficult levels.







Go toward either edge of the stage and find the walls of the Temple of the Elders. It will be on the outside of the walls, although it could be on either side, in a clay pot. You can break the pot to get the Strange Battery and move on to the final stage. In that stage, you will need to move toward the bottom right of the level with at least one keycard in hand.

This will be in the caverns and players will need to navigate off the side of the stage and into a cavern area that will require some movement and tricky platforming to get through. Make your way to the left after that to find the Rift Chest where you can store the Strange Battery. After that, you can defeat the final boss or lose, as this works similarly to artifacts in Risk of Rain 2 in that you can get the item back in the next run.

When you restart, you will need to play on either Rainstorm or Monsoon difficulty instead, as it will not spawn on Drizzle difficulty. Find the corresponding chest on the second stage and proceed to Stage 3. Go to the teleporter and wait until exactly 22:00 minutes on the clock to use it to take you to Stage 4.




At that point, search the Stage for a hidden area where a robot character will be waiting on the ground. Reactivating them and letting them kill your character will unlock an achievement and a secret character like in Risk of Rain 2. When you go back to the main menu, there will be a sixteenth secret playable character known as Robomando added to the options to pick from. Now that you have used the Strange Battery, you can go exploring with Robomando to find even more unlocks and secrets in Risk of Rain Returns.
