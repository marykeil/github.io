## Literature Review

December 20th’s Wordle answer contains a repeating letter, which might cause many players to lose their streaks if they don’t use hints. 





To circumvent this, you can use Wordle’s hard mode, which is the best way to solve answers with repeating letters. Since this mode locks the correct positions of letters, you will be forced to use those letters in the same spots in your consequent guesses. This will remove the risk of using random guesses, which usually causes most players to lose their daily streak.
