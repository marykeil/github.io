  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The PlayStation 4 still holds its ground in the gaming industry, with a library of scary games that offer a frightful experience.
The scarcity of PlayStation 5 consoles has kept many players using the PS4, proving its lasting relevance.
Scary games like The Quarry, Little Nightmares, and Until Dawn provide tense and terrifying experiences on the PS4.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The last-gen console is still host to some of the most masterful titles of the age, but the PS4&rsquo;s scariest games are the most difficult to forget.</p>
<p>Despite debuting over a decade ago, the PlayStation 4 still manages to hold its ground in the gaming industry - especially in the horror genre. Naturally, the PS4 misses out on some newer titles, which are solely made available for the current-gen PlayStation 5, but the former has still accrued an impressive game library over the years. And even several years into the PS5&rsquo;s release, many games are still available via cross-generational release. From modern masterpieces to timeless classics, the scariest games for the PS4 let players experience the fright of their lives nonetheless.
Much of the reason behind the PS4&rsquo;s lasting popularity lies in the PS5&rsquo;s conversely rocky lifespan. Launching during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the console faced a number of problems, including chip shortages, general supply chain issues, and scalpers. As a result, the PlayStation 5 became notoriously difficult to obtain, leaving many players stuck with the last-gen console. The PS5 shortage is finally dwindling, which means more users will be able to get their hands on the newest hardware - but the PlayStation 4&rsquo;s scariest games prove that its predecessor is still relevant.</p>
<p>25 Best Horror Games To Play Right Now
From demonic entities to sadistic killers, there&rsquo;s so much to choose from for horror game fans. Here are 25 of the best horror titles available.</p>
<p>15  The Quarry Is An Interactive Slasher Movie
Supermassive Games, 2022</p>
<p>The Quarry</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    June 10, 2022     Developer(s)    Supermassive Games     Publisher(s)    Supermassive Games     Genre(s)    Adventure , Survival Horror     ESRB    m     How Long To Beat    9 hours</p>
<p>Supermassive Games is best known for revolutionizing the choice-based horror genre, and The Quarry certainly doesn&rsquo;t disappoint on this account. Inspired by slasher classics like Friday the 13th, it follows a group of counselors who find themselves stranded at a summer camp for a night. Their wholesome bonding experience quickly turns into a pandemonium of violence, dark family secrets, and even lycanthropy.
Players will need to use their own best judgment to make it through the night, and the fate of the counselors is entirely in their control. The Quarry has 186 endings, depending on who lives, who dies, and who&rsquo;s infected. Something as small as the wrong dialogue option can lead to a gruesome, brutal death, making The Quarry a perpetually tense and terrifying experience.</p>
<p>14  Little Nightmares Is An Atmospheric, Dreamlike Odyssey
Tarsier Studios, 2017</p>
<p>Little Nightmares<br>
Little Nightmares is a survival horror game with puzzle and platforming elements. It was developed by Tarsier Studios and takes place in a heavily stylized 2.5D world. Players take on the role of a young girl named Six as she tries to escape the Maw: a giant underwater vessel that&rsquo;s home to a variety of twisted and terrifying beings.</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Xbox One , Stadia , PlayStation 4 , PC , PlayStation 5 , Nintendo Switch , Xbox Series X     Released    February 11, 2021     Developer(s)    Tarsier Studios     Publisher(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment     Genre(s)    Horror , Platformer     ESRB    T     How Long To Beat    5 Hours     Prequel    Little Nightmares</p>
<p>2017&rsquo;s Little Nightmares takes heavy inspiration from classic side-scrolling games such as Limbo to weave a dark and foreboding narrative. The creep factor is cranked up to the max, with eerie visuals and ominous creatures haunting every corner. There&rsquo;s no combat in Little Nightmares, forcing the player to rely on stealth and silence in order to survive the fever-dreamlike experience.
As they control Six, a raincoat-clad girl, players must stay alive by solving complex puzzles and avoiding the horrors around every corner. So, while its art style is tame and somewhat misleading, it still manages to evoke the unmatched level of dread brought on by the player&rsquo;s worst childhood fears, mixing helplessness with surreality to create a pervasive sense of dread. All that makes Little Nightmares one of the scariest games for the PS4 - the only thing that can compare is its sequel, Little Nightmares 2, and the upcoming third game Little Nightmares 3.</p>
<p>13  Until Dawn Puts A Psychological Twist On The Quarry
Supermassive Games, 2015</p>
<p>Until Dawn</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 4     Released    August 25, 2015     Developer(s)    Supermassive Games     Publisher(s)    Sony     Genre(s)    Survival Horror , Action-Adventure     ESRB    m     How Long To Beat    8 hours</p>
<p>Although The Quarry is sure to get the blood pumping, it could never live up to its blueprint, Until Dawn. Similarly, this title tests the player&rsquo;s decision-making skills and reflexes as they&rsquo;re tasked with saving a group of teenagers, whose snowy spring break getaway is terrorized by a maniacal killer, supernatural beings, and haunting events of the past.
What makes Until Dawn even scarier than its successor is the element of psychological horror, which turns the game from a mere murder mystery to one that tackles complex themes of mental health. Between memorable sessions with the in-game psychologist and a masterful plot twist, this title is one that will likely remain on the minds of players long after they&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>12  Alan Wake Remastered Revives A Survival Classic
Remedy Entertainment, 2021</p>
<p>Alan Wake</p>
<p>Franchise    Alan Wake     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox 360 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    May 14, 2010     Developer(s)    Remedy Entertainment     Publisher(s)    Microsoft Game Studios     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , Thriller     ESRB    T     Sequel(s)    Alan Wake&rsquo;s American Nightmare , Alan Wake 2</p>
<p>Alan Wake Remastered is an intact revival of the original game, a surreal journey into the mind of the eponymous writer. It tells a brain-melting story that challenges the player&rsquo;s mechanical skill and mental fortitude alike. Suffering from seemingly incurable writer&rsquo;s block, Alan, along with his wife Alice, flees big-city pressure on a trip to the isolated town of Bright Falls, Washington. However, no sooner have they settled into their cabin on the idyllic Cauldron Lake than the power goes out, Alice vanishes, and Alan wakes up in a crashed vehicle with a week&rsquo;s worth of missing time.
Oh, and terrifying creatures roam the night, appearing to be made of darkness itself. Every bullet, flashlight battery, and cup of coffee counts as Alan tries to find his wife before Bright Falls swallows him whole. Dredging up childhood traumas, the consequences of fame, and the nature of fiction and reality themselves, Alan Wake weaves a memorable narrative without compromising on its stunningly difficult gameplay. It&rsquo;s only elevated by its respective spin-off and sequel, Alan Wake&rsquo;s American Nightmare and Remedy&rsquo;s magnum opus Alan Wake 2, but neither of those are on PS4.</p>
<p>11  Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice Is A Realistically Dark Tragedy
Ninja Theory, 2017</p>
<p>Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice</p>
<p>Franchise    Hellblade     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Nintendo Switch , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    August 7, 2017     Developer(s)    Ninja Theory     Publisher(s)    Xbox Game Studios     Genre(s)    Action     ESRB    m     How Long To Beat    7h 32m</p>
<p>Though not a horror game by definition, Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice is one of the darkest and most disturbing games of recent years. It&rsquo;s a trip into the broken psyche of Senua, a Celtic warrior on a quest to battle the Norse Gods for the return of her beloved. She&rsquo;ll have to overcome ordeal after ordeal as she descends deeper into her own personal hell.
In fact, Hellblade was co-created with the support of actual mental health experts. Players will be forced to contend with a barrage of voices in their head, not to mention illusions that distort what&rsquo;s real, and what is a figment of Senua&rsquo;s mind. As such, Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice is one of the scariest games for the PS4, but it simultaneously tells a tragic love story that somehow makes it even more impactful.</p>
<p>10  The Last Of Us: Part 2 Is A Divisive, But Terrifying Sequel
Naughty Dog, 2020</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2</p>
<p>Franchise    The Last of Us     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4     Released    June 19, 2020     Developer(s)    Naughty Dog     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment     Genre(s)    Action , Survival Horror , Adventure     Engine    Naughty Dog Proprietary Engine     ESRB    M     How Long To Beat    20-25 hours     Prequel    The Last of Us: Part 1</p>
<p>The Last Of Us: Part 2 is primarily an action-adventure game that continues the post-apocalyptic story of Ellie and Joel, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop it from being one of the scariest PlayStation 4 games, either. The infected are terrifying enough as is - especially with the introduction of the grossly-mutated Rat King - but it&rsquo;s ultimately the psychological trauma and grim character development that makes TLOU 2 so terrifying.
The death of one of the franchise&rsquo;s most beloved characters leads Ellie&rsquo;s mental state to slowly deteriorate throughout the course of the game, causing her to become increasingly aggressive and violent. The player is helpless as they watch this progression ruin the protagonist&rsquo;s life, and this makes for an experience that is equally moving as it is horrifying. While the PS5 remaster has some unique benefits, including TLOU 2&rsquo;s lost levels, the PS4 version is perfectly fine, and a complete game in its own right.</p>
<p>9  Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Resurrects The Classic Survival Horror Franchise
Capcom, 2017</p>
<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</p>
<p>Franchise    Resident Evil     Platform(s)    PC , Steam , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , Amazon Luna , Stadia , Nintendo Switch     Released    January 24, 2017     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Survival Horror , Action , First-Person Shooter     ESRB    M     How Long To Beat    9 Hours     Prequel(s)    Resident Evil 6 , Resident Evil 5 , Resident Evil 4 , Resident Evil 3 (2020) , Resident Evil 2 (2019) , Resident Evil     Sequel(s)    Resident Evil Village</p>
<p>The Resident Evil franchise has had its ups and downs when it comes to the scare factor, but 2017&rsquo;s Resident Evil 7: Biohazard single-handedly solves this issue. In a fully original chapter of the Resident Evil story, Biohazard takes place in a new location, features new enemy types, and stars a new protagonist. This twisted tale delves into the lives of the backwater Baker family, who, thanks to the infection of a dangerous virus, possess superhuman strength alongside a relentless desire to kill Ethan Winters.
To make matters worse, RE7 was the first in the series to adopt a first-person perspective. Players are placed directly into the shoes of the protagonist, and thus forced to traverse the gory horrors of the game more personally than ever before. Shooting and eliminating the Bakers isn&rsquo;t always an option, and so the most that Ethan can do is run and hide from these chilling monsters, easily making Resident Evil 7 one of the scariest PlayStation 4 games, and a contender for scariest in the legendary franchise.</p>
<p>8  Layers Of Fear Blurs Art And Reality
Bloober Team, 2016</p>
<p>Layers of Fear (2023)</p>
<p>Franchise    Layers of Fear     Platform(s)    PC , macOS , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    June 15, 2023     Developer(s)    Bloober Team , Anshar Studios     Publisher(s)    Bloober Team     Genre(s)    Puzzle , Survival Horror     ESRB    M     Prequel    Layers of Fear 2</p>
<p>Layers of Fear is a trip into the psyche of a mysterious painter, whose only goal is to create his magnum opus, but the game is far from a light-hearted art session. Rather, players will see the protagonist&rsquo;s own harrowing backstory unfold before their very eyes, and it will often be difficult to tell reality apart from delusion in this psychological horror experience.
The game&rsquo;s biggest strength is its atmosphere, as dim lighting, unsettling music, and psychedelic visuals infiltrate the setting at an increasing rate. By the end, players will need to brave their way through a series of disturbing, mind-melting scenes that might make them question their own sanity, making Layers of Fear one of the scariest PS4 games.</p>
<p>7  Alien: Isolation Is A Harrowing Journey Through Space
Creative Assembly, 2014</p>
<p>Alien: Isolation</p>
<p>Franchise    Alien     Platform(s)    Android , iOS , Linux , OS X , Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360 , Xbox One     Released    October 6, 2014     Developer(s)    Creative Assembly     Publisher(s)    Sega     Genre(s)     Sci-Fi , Survival Horror     ESRB    M     How Long To Beat    18.5 Hours</p>
<p>The lonely, cold, and ever-uncharted expanse of space is rife with potential for horror games, and Alien: Isolation capitalizes on this prospect expertly. This title explores the journey of Amanda Ripley, who sets out to find her missing mother aboard a space station, only to be stalked by a vicious, deadly Xenomorph.
As its title may imply, Alien: Isolation tasks players with surviving the ordeal almost entirely on their own, with Amanda only rarely being aided by crewmates (some of whom turn out not to be on her side at all). Since weapons are basically useless against the Xenomorph, the only tools at her disposal are a motion tracker, flashlight, handgun, and her own brain. Calculated strategy is a must in Alien: Isolation, as the Xenomorph&rsquo;s advanced AI can make every mistake a life-or-death situation.</p>
<p>6  Dredge Is A Fishing Trip Gone Wrong
Black Salt Games, 2023</p>
<p>Dredge</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 30, 2023     Developer(s)    Black Salt Games     Publisher(s)    Team17     Genre(s)    Adventure , Simulation     ESRB    E10+</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something so relaxing about fishing in video games: the waterside ambiance, the colorful lures, the satisfying twitch of the controller when the fish takes the bait - that is, until the player reels in a horror of Lovecraftian proportions. Dredge turns all the idyllic calm of the typical fishing game on its head. Straining to see through thick fog, dodging gargantuan sea monsters, and hallucinating imaginary hazards all become par for the course before long.
But there&rsquo;s more to this little fishing town than meets the eye. As players land bigger and better fish, they&rsquo;ll also reel in mysterious relics that chip away at a greater mystery. In the end, it all comes down to a climactic decision that may determine the fate of the entire town. Dredge is notable not only because it&rsquo;s terrifying, but also because it&rsquo;s one of the most distinctly different horror games in recent memory. With its refreshing twists on two classic game genres - horror and fishing - it&rsquo;s unlike anything else out there.</p>
<p>5  SOMA Boasts Deep-Sea Horror And An Apocalyptic Mystery
Frictional Games, 2015</p>
<p>SOMA</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    September 22, 2015     Developer(s)    Frictional Games     Publisher(s)    Frictional Games     Genre(s)    Survival , Horror     ESRB    M</p>
<p>Frictional Games&rsquo; SOMA trades a more traditional horror environment for a deep, disturbing underwater setting, which serves as a surprisingly effective backdrop for this one-of-a-kind horror experience. As players attempt to piece together the story of the protagonist, Simon, and the downfall of the facility as a whole, they&rsquo;ll also need to survive against the monsters that lurk about by solely using stealth mechanics, which already creates an unshakable sense of tension.
However, the most terrifying aspects of SOMA are the moral conundrums that are presented therein. The overarching narrative, which concerns the sentience of artificial intelligence and the survival of the human species, makes both Simon and the player question their own beliefs, which makes for a powerful, yet endlessly scary game for the PS4.</p>
<p>4  Resident Evil 2 Is A Horror Masterpiece Reborn
Capcom, 2019</p>
<p>Resident Evil 2 (2019)</p>
<p>Franchise    Resident Evil     Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , Nintendo Switch , Steam     Released    January 25, 2019     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Survival Horror     ESRB    M     How Long To Beat    8 Hours     Sequel    Resident Evil 3 (2020)     Prequel    Resident Evil</p>
<p>Building upon the potent foundation of the original survival horror classic, the Resident Evil 2 remake fleshed out the iconic game with an updated game engine, new voice actors, dialogue, and scenes to round out the package. This proved to be a massive success, with the end result being a true masterpiece both within the franchise, and the game industry as a whole, and sparking the release of two further Resident Evil revivals, like the more recently released Resident Evil 4 remake.
But there&rsquo;s something about RE2 that the later remakes, as good as they are, can&rsquo;t match. The Resident Evil 2 remake remains faithful to the plot of the 1998 version, as a young Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield traverse the zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. Set in the narrow corridors of an abandoned police station, the sewers beneath it, and an Umbrella Corporation lab, RE2 is as tense as it is claustrophobic. But thanks to its updates, the 2019 game sets itself apart as a pinnacle of cinematic survival horror, with horrifying enemies like Mr. X becoming downright dread-inducing.</p>
<p>3  Outlast Is A Dark, Stealth-Focused Nightmare
Red Barrels, 2013</p>
<p>Outlast</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PC , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Nintendo Switch     Released    September 4, 2013     Developer(s)    Red Barrels     Publisher(s)    Red Barrels     Genre(s)    Survival Horror</p>
<p>Outlast is one of the scariest games ever to have been created, and it&rsquo;s no less frightening now than it was at the time of release. It tells the tale of a courageous journalist who dives into the bowels of a psychiatric hospital, only to find himself trapped and pursued by patients who have been forcibly experimented on, thanks to a deranged doctor.
The player&rsquo;s ability to hide is directly correlated with their chances of survival; there is no combat system, just stealth. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, players will also be at the mercy of their camera&rsquo;s night vision mode, which provides the only source of light in the oftentimes pitch-black asylum. Thus, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Outlast remains one of the scariest games for the PlayStation 4, despite its age.</p>
<p>2  Amnesia: The Bunker Is The Latest In A Groundbreaking Series
Frictional Games, 2023</p>
<p>Amnesia: The Bunker</p>
<p>Franchise    Amnesia     Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    May 23, 2023     Developer(s)    Frictional Games     Publisher(s)    Frictional Games     Genre(s)    Survival Horror     ESRB    M     Sequel    Amnesia: Rebirth</p>
<p>Being the most recent entry in the Amnesia franchise, Amnesia: The Bunker is much different than its predecessors, but it by no means lacks in the scares department. Set in the labyrinthine passages of a World War I bunker, the latest game in the Amnesia series unleashes ancient horrors on a rapidly modernizing world. After being knocked unconscious by an artillery shell, protagonist Henri wakes up in a completely sealed bunker, where the only other living human is quickly abducted by a mysterious creature known only as the Beast.
As he searches for generator fuel to keep the lights on, Henri uncovers bits and pieces of an age-old mystery. Resources are strictly limited, and every journey into the bunker is fraught with unique peril - even more than previous games in the series thanks to its procedurally generated nature. What it lacks in the storytelling strengths of previous games in the series, Amnesia: The Bunker makes up for in creepy atmosphere and tense gameplay. That makes it one of the best horror games of 2023.</p>
<p>1  Visage Is The Scariest PS4 Game
SadSquare Studio, 2020</p>
<p>Visage</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    October 2, 2018     Genre(s)    Horror     ESRB    m     How Long To Beat    8h 45m</p>
<p>However, the first-person experience Visage ultimately tops the list. The game&rsquo;s four chapters each portray different, yet equally distressing narratives that heavily focus on mental health, and the challenging puzzles that are found therein make for engaging gameplay that doesn&rsquo;t take away too much from the horror of the title.
For better or worse, most of Visage&rsquo;s success stems from its clear P.T. inspiration. Although the short demo unfortunately never made it past its early stages, it changed the horror scene forever with its chilling, liminal atmosphere and revolutionary gameplay, which took direct advantage of player psychology. Visage aims to recreate the magic of P.T., and although it isn&rsquo;t quite the same, it largely succeeds in generating those same primal fight-or-flight reactions alongside a constant, underlying sense of unease. As such, only the bravest of players should tackle Visage, the scariest game for the PlayStation 4 to date.
With such a vast library of excellent horror games available on the PS4, it&rsquo;s easy to see why many still haven&rsquo;t upgraded to the PS5. There&rsquo;s a wealth of great games to play through on the previous-generation console, and even the most devoted horror game players haven&rsquo;t even scratched the surface. Thanks to backwards compatibility, many of these games are also available on the PS5. So, even though all these terrifying titles are available on PlayStation 4, none of them are exclusive to it.</p>
