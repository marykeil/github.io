## Literature Review

Guardians looking to earn the Wishbearer Title will need to complete the Familiar Felines Triumph. This is done by collecting all 14 Starcats.





Completing the Familiar Felines Triumph will reward you with the Wyrmguard Ghost shell. Back in Season of the Haunted, Guardians were tasked with collecting all Calus Bobbleheads on the Derelict Leviathan. Both missions are similar, having you scour through activities and various destinations to find all 14 Starcats. Unfortunately, this Triumph cannot currently be completed as all collectibles are not released. More Starcats are added in Destiny 2 with each story update.




                  How To Unlock Loadouts In Destiny 2 (Season of the Witch)   You can unlock extra loadout slots in Destiny 2 during the Season of the Witch. Here is how you can get four extra loadout spaces to utilize.   



As of writing this article, all 14 Starcats are not in Destiny 2. New locations will continue to be added with future updates of Season of the Witch.





 Blind Well Starcat Location 
          

The first Starcat is the easiest to find since it is located in the Blind Well activity. Guardians can ride their Sparrow or select the Blind Well from the Dreaming City Destination on the map. The Starcat is located directly north of the entrance against the far door. Hold the interact button to send the cat to the H.E.L.M.






 Garden Of Plenty (Riven&#39;s Lair) Starcat Location 
          

The second Starcat is slightly harder to locate because it is found in the Garden of Plenty. This is a location in Riven&#39;s Lair, accessed during the story for Week 1 or selecting the activity from the H.E.L.M. Destination. Esoterickk on YouTube shows a fantastic visual guide on the exact location of the first two Starcats.

Upon arriving in the Garden of Plenty, you will want to go past the first group of enemies and stop at the first staircase. Make an immediate left and drop onto a ledge and collect the Starcat.


 






 Temple Of The Queen&#39;s Wrath (Riven&#39;s Lair) Starcat Location 
          

During the second week, four more Starcats are revealed, with the first being located in the Temple of The Queen&#39;s Wrath. Guardians can reach this area either through the story in week 2 or by launching the Riven&#39;s Lair activity in Destiny 2. The Starcat is located in a room with a large group of enemies. Defeat the foes and make your way to the right corner, beyond the pillars.

                  Destiny 2: All Deck of Whispers Cards (&amp; How They Work)   There is a total of 55 Major and Minor Arcana cards to collect for the Deck of Whispers in Destiny 2â€™s Season of the Witch. Here are all of them.   



 Chamber Of Starlight (Lost Sector) Starcat Location 
          




The remaining Starcats for week 2 are located in Lost Sectors in the Dreaming City. Head to the Chamber of Starlight and clear the final room. The Starcat is sitting on the end of a table on the right side of the arena.



 Bay Of Drowned Wishes (Lost Sector) Starcat Location 
          

The next Starcat can be found at the end of the Bay of Drowned Wishes Lost Sector. Luckily, this activity is just behind the Landing Zone. Clear out the final room and the Starcat can be collected on a small ledge to the right of the chest.

                  How To Get The Haruspex Title In Destiny 2   You can already start farming to get the Haruspex title in Destiny 2. Here are all the Triumphs needed to complete and the deadline to do so.   



 Aphelion&#39;s Rest (Lost Sector) Starcat Location 
          




Head to the Aphelion&#39;s Rest Lost Sector in the Dreaming City for the last Starcat for week 2. This activity is located next to Petra Venj on the map. The Starcat can be found in the last room above the chest. There is a bowl that will glow blue which holds the collectible.

As mentioned previously, all 14 Starcats must be collected to earn the Wyrmguard Ghost shell and complete the Familiar Felines Triumph. This will bring Guardians one step closer to earning the Wishbearer Title in Destiny 2.
