## Literature Review

Five Nights at Freddy’s: Help Wanted 2 features two endings, but how do you get them, what are they, and what do they mean for the story as a whole?




Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted 2 has been released, and that means there&#39;s a new set of endings to dig into for lore. The first Help Wanted game set up the plot for FNAF: Security Breach by revealing how Afton - or at least his consciousness - could return by essentially becoming a computer virus. Similarly, Help Wanted 2 helps explain events that happen in FNAF: Security Breach Ruin.

William Afton has been a central character in the FNAF lore since the beginning of the franchise, and he&#39;s the driving force behind the events that lead to the animatronics being possessed by the spirits of children. Even the recent movie references Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s villain&#39;s ability to return repeatedly, no matter what happens to the form he inhabits at the time. Unsurprisingly, Afton is also at the center of both endings of Help Wanted 2 in the form of Glitchtrap.

                  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Springtrap Actor Details Pressures Of Playing Iconic Villain   Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s actor who played Springtrap details the pressure of playing the iconic and beloved villain, especially given the twist.   


 FNAF: Help Wanted 2&#39;s Plot 
Leading Up To The Ruin DLC
          




FNAF: Help Wanted 2 is set around the same time as, or before, Security Breach and its DLC, Ruin, on the timeline of events — or so it seemed at first. The protagonist remains unnamed throughout the game, but they&#39;re hired to work at Fazbear Entertainment and have to interact with different areas of the location for their job. This means that each area has tasks that need to be completed. If the protagonist doesn&#39;t complete the required tasks in each area to an acceptable standard, then the animatronics of that area attack and result in a game over.

                  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Theory Reveals Mike Is   To A Key FNAF Character (&amp; It Changes The Games)   The Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie suggests William Afton isn&#39;t the protagonist&#39;s father — but a theory does link movie Mike to another FNAF character.   

There are a couple of minigames available at the start of the game, but more are unlocked as the protagonist completes tasks. Continuing through the game, more animatronics start appearing, and it seems that Glitchtrap is starting to take control over them and make them hostile to the protagonist. This is the same state that they&#39;re in at the start of Security Breach, as shown by their hostility towards Gregory. However, the protagonist keeps working and fulfilling the tasks required of them for their job. It turns out that the protagonist has been wearing the Vanny mask without realizing it, and they&#39;re actually in an abandoned building, not an active Pizzaplex.






 FNAF: Help Wanted 2&#39;s Normal Ending 
Complete All Main Tasks
          

The normal ending is achieved by simply going through the tasks of the game. In it, the protagonist realizes that they&#39;re wearing the Vanny mask and that all the tasks have been happening in a fake world. Meanwhile, they learn they&#39;re in the abandoned Pizzaplex where Security Breach and Ruin both take place. It turns out that the mask has been allowing Glitchtrap to access the protagonist&#39;s mind just like it did with Vanessa in Security Breach. The protagonist sees a hand come out of a charging pod, but then they&#39;re ambushed by staff bots and unable to see who or what emerges.

                  How To Play Every FNAF Game In Chronological Order   Five Nights at Freddy’s has a notoriously messy timeline that’s built on speculation, but it’s possible to guess a chronological order for the games.   




After losing consciousness from the staff bots, the protagonist wakes up. But this time, they see from the point of view of another staff bot, seemingly having been turned into one from a combination of being corrupted by the Vanny Mask and being attacked, possibly even killed. To finish the ending, the protagonist sees Cassie, the main character of Ruin, and hands the Vanny mask to her. This allows her to be influenced by Glitchtrap to free the Mimic. It seems like Help Wanted 2 shows how the protagonist was used purely for Afton&#39;s plot to pass the mask onto somebody who could free the Mimic, although it&#39;s not clear if Afton was able to possess the Mimic.



 FNAF: Help Wanted 2&#39;s Secret Ending 
Play Princess Quest
         

The ending is a bit different if the protagonist plays Princess Quest after booting up the Princess Quest 4 machine. Playing Princess Quest is connected to good outcomes, which is seen in FNAF: Security Breach&#39;s best ending, which is earned by having Gregory beat all three Princess Quest games. However, that isn&#39;t exactly the case with Help Wanted 2, as playing Princess Quest results in a secret ending that provides information about Vanessa&#39;s fate and the protagonist&#39;s fate, whether that&#39;s a good outcome or not.




The first part of this ending shows Vanessa as Vanny picks up a little toy Glitchtrap and crushes it with her hands before leaving. Since Princess Quest is related to the Security Breach&#39;s ending where Vanessa is freed from Glitchtrap&#39;s control, this scene seems to reference her regaining her freedom. In which case, it seems more like an Easter Egg than a plot point since Ruin already makes a strong case for Vanessa being freed to be the canon ending.


 

The second part, however, shows the protagonist from another new point of view. This time, they&#39;re trapped in a claw machine and surrounded by other familiar toys. Unlike Vanessa, it seems that the protagonist is trapped under Glitchtrap&#39;s control indefinitely. And that would fit the situation considering the protagonist has been turned into a staff bot, meaning that they&#39;d be connected to the system corrupted by Glitchtrap, whereas Vanessa was still a human while she was Vanny, and therefore able to shake off his control and return to her normal life.






 Putting The Information Together 
What&#39;s Learned From Help Wanted 2
          

Help Wanted 2 explains how the Vanny mask made its way to Cassie. It also shows how convincing the world shown by the mask can be, and given how ambiguous the ending of Ruin feels when Cassie doesn&#39;t know if Gregory is really talking to her or not, its ability to fool the protagonist into thinking they&#39;re working in an active location isn&#39;t surprising. With only two endings, there are far fewer unanswered questions left about the events of the game, but they provide interesting context regarding the set-up for Ruin.

While Help Wanted 2 isn&#39;t the most mysterious entry in the franchise, it provides context that helps clarify the events of Security Breach and Ruin. Additionally, it reaffirms the likelihood that Glitchtrap has been able to take a physical form once more by possessing the Mimic, bringing William Afton back into the world. Right now, it&#39;s not possible to tell what new horrors Afton will commit if he truly does have a new physical body to use after seeing the endings of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted 2.
