## Literature Review

The EA App may have accidentally revealed The Sims 4&#39;s new DLC prematurely, but it&#39;s one fans have been asking for.




EA may have accidentally revealed The Sims 4&#39;s new DLC prematurely, confirming one pack that fans have been requesting for months. Since the life-simulator series&#39; launch back in the year 2000, The Sims games have had fairly regular releases for new expansion sets, with some focusing on more realistic situations and others on more fantastical genres like horror with The Sims 4&#39;s Paranormal Stuff pack or the vampire-themed Nightlife expansion for The Sims 2.




In May 2023, EA asked The Sims 4 players to vote between two of these genre-driven expansion packs. The choices for a building-centric pack were between a fantasy-themed Medieval Castle or a High Tech Futurism pack, and the Medieval Castle pack won, Unfortunately, once the results were announced, EA went quiet on the matter, leaving fans eagerly awaiting some kind of update.



Alongside the aforementioned building-based pack, the community also voted for a Create A Sim fashion and accessories pack centered around gothic fashion.

 The Medieval-Themed Castle Estate Kit Has Been Leaked 
Although Its Release Date Is Likely False
          




Eight months later, an update finally arrived due to an accidental leak on the EA app. As reported by Sims Community (via The Gamer), the &#34;Castle Estate Kit&#34; listing appeared on the UK version of the EA app. The listing featured two screenshots of grand castles built with the new kit, with The Sims regulars, Bella and Mortimer Goth talking on a balcony overlooking the grounds.

As is somewhat standard for The Sims 4&#39;s kits and packs of the same size, the Castle Estate Kit is priced at £4.99, or £4.49 for EA Play subscribers. The pack&#39;s release date is almost definitely a placeholder, or has an error, however, as it is listed as October 15, 2099, over 75 years from now.

EA Wants Players To &#34;Build Something Grand&#34; With The New Kit
          




According to the official description on the EA App, The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit features &#34;stone walls, leaded glass, and everything you need to create the perfect dramatic backdrop for your next story.&#34; With these building elements, the kit is intended for those who want to &#34;build something grand&#34; with plenty of &#34;gravitas&#34;. Alongside the aforementioned stone walls and leaded glass, the Castle Estate Kit includes parapets, arrow slits, and gargoyles as some of the many classic castle details.

Such a detailed listing indicates that while the placeholder date suggests October 15 (even if its release year is clearly wrong), The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit could be officially released a lot sooner. While the fact that Medieval may have beaten out Sci-Fi in the genre vote may have come as a disappointment to those hoping for more official sci-fi expansions for the game, the impending arrival of the Castle Estate Kit should delight fans of the 2011 spin-off title, The Sims Medieval who want to recreate such an era in the more recent, ongoing game.
