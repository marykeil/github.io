# All Shiny-Locked Pokémon In Pokémon Legends Arceus


## SUMMARY 



  Over 20 Pokémon in Legends: Arceus are Shiny locked, making them difficult to obtain in Shiny form.   The Legendaries, Mythicals, and starter Pokémon are among the Shiny locked species in the game.   Despite the limitations, players still have the opportunity to catch Shiny Pokémon and increase their chances using various mechanics.

## Literature Review

Pokémon Legends: Arceus has many rare and powerful Pokémon that are Shiny locked, but Nintendo and Game Freak could release them in events later.




There are over 20 Shiny-locked monsters in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. While Shiny hunting is easier in Arceus than in other entries, there&#39;s no way to get some of the game&#39;s most powerful Pokémon in Shiny form. Shiny-locked Pokémon must be hacked to acquire, but players really shouldn&#39;t pursue this route as it can often lead to bans from Nintendo&#39;s online services. Thankfully, most species in Pokémon Legends: Arceus&#39; Pokédex appear in Shiny forms, meaning players are likely to catch one or two favorites with unique colors.




Pokémon Legends: Arceus implements several systems to assist with catching Shiny Pokémon, including Research Levels, a Shiny Charm, and Mass Outbreaks that increase the spawn rate of a single species. There&#39;s often a pattern to which Pokémon are Shiny-locked in games, with the most common offenders being the starter trio, title Legendaries, event Pokémon, and limited event monsters. While Legends: Arceus has mostly maintained those patterns, a few creatures are absent from the list that may surprise players.

                  How To Catch All 242 Pokémon In Legends: Arceus (Complete Pokédex)   There are 242 Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and players will have to catch them all to fill the first-ever Pokédex of the Hisui region.   


 Are Legendary Pokémon Shiny Locked In Legends: Arceus? 
          




Unsurprisingly, all 11 available Legendaries are Shiny locked in Pokémon Legends: Arcues, including Dialga and Palkia (and their new forms). While this may be disappointing for Shiny hunters, many of these monsters have appeared in Shiny forms in previous games. There are several static encounters in Pokémon Legends: Arceus that have Shiny odds, but those hoping for a teal Dialga shouldn&#39;t hold their breath.

Thankfully, the only new Legendary available in Pokémon Legends: Arceus is Enamorus, so it&#39;s likely players may see an unlocked Shiny Enamorus in future games. The full list of Shiny-locked Legendaries are:

  Dialga   Palkia   Uxie   Mespirit   Azelf   Heatran   Regigas   Tornadus   Thundurus   Landorus   Enamorus  

Nintendo frequently holds events that offer legitimate Shinies, such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet offering a Shiny Lucario ahead of The Ingido Disk&#39;s release, or Sword and Shield offering Shinies of their cover Legendaries. Unfortunately, given Scarlet and Violet&#39;s release, it&#39;s unlikely that players can expect these events to happen anymore, and these Pokémon will remain Shiny locked in Legends: Arceus forever.






 Are Mythical Pokémon Shiny Locked In Legends: Arceus? 
          

All 5 of the Mythical Pokémon in Legends: Arceus are Shiny locked. While it&#39;s disappointing that players can&#39;t catch Shiny Arceus in Arceus, it&#39;s an understandable limitation that prevents the creature from becoming too abundant. The Mythical Pokémon in Legends: Arceus aren&#39;t guaranteed spawns, with some being locked behind preexisting save files in other games. For example, a Pokémon BDSP save is required for Darkrai to spawn, eliminating the possibility of a Shiny for any players without the remakes. The full list is:

  Phione   Manaphy   Darkrai   Shaymin   Arceus  

Despite the lack of Mythical Shinies, Pokémon Legends: Arceus makes them far more accessible than in previous games. Darkrai and Arceus are difficult to capture in other traditional Pokémon titles, and despite the lengthy requirements for their aopearance in Legends: Arceus, they&#39;re far more accessible in the semi-free-roaming prequel.






 Shiny Locked Starter Pokémon &amp; Evolutions 
          

 The starters in Pokémon Legends: Arceus aren&#39;t Sinnoh&#39;s expected starters, as the creatures have come from overseas alongside Professor Laventon. While some players may want to restart their games hundreds of times to make their partner Pokémon extremely special, that isn&#39;t an option in Legends: Arceus. This likely has to do with the cutscenes required for the character sprites and their appearances throughout Jubilife Village as players progress through the game and return to Professor Laventon.

                  Pokémon Legends Arceus: How To Get More Sticky Globs (&amp; What They Do)   Sticky Globs are a throwable item in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Players can use them to capture more Pokémon during Mass Outbreaks and Shiny Hunting.   




Thankfully, these Shiny locks only apply to the starter Pokémon that players choose at the game&#39;s beginning. Oshawott, Cyndaquil, and Rowlet are all available to spawn during Pokémon Legends: Arceus&#39; Space-Time Distortions in various areas. Oshawott spawns in Alabaster Icelands distortions, Cyndaquil spawns in Crimson Mirelands distortions, and Rowlet spawns in Coronet Highlands distortions.



 Shiny-Locked Gift Pokémon 
          

Legends: Arceus has event Pokémon for players in Japanese territories that are unfortunately Shiny locked but provide a meaningful new partner. Players can receive a Happiny to celebrate their birth month from February to October 2022, while Piplup&#39;s event focused on a &#34;Save the Piplups&#34; initiative out of the Pokémon Centers in Osaka, Kanazawa, and Mega Tokyo.




While Nintendo occasionally gifts players Shiny Legendaries or rare species, these gifted monsters are underwhelming. The failure of these monsters to appear in Shiny form is an additional disappointment, as there&#39;s no hope for players to manipulate the code before redeeming their event Pokémon. Additionally, with the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it&#39;s unlikely that any Shiny-locked Pokémon in Legends: Arceus will be updated in the future.

Players hoping for Shiny locks on the existing list to change shouldn&#39;t hold their breath, as once a Pokémon is Shiny locked, it&#39;s unlikely to receive any changes outside of events. Thankfully, there are hundreds of other creatures available in Shiny form. There are also many mechanics players can use in Pokémon Legends: Arceus to increase Shiny chances. In addition, Hisui features many unique creatures to catch, including several regional variants of popular Pokémon like Growlithe, Braviary, Lilligant, and more.
