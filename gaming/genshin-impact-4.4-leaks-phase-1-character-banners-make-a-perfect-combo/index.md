## Literature Review

The leaks regarding the character banner structure in Phase 1 of Genshin Impact 4.4 make a lot of sense, for both gameplay and lore alike.




A few new Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks revealed details about the composition of the Phase 1 character banners, and the alleged heroes for the first period of the update are lining up to be the perfect combo. While the popular action RPG is still in the midst of Version 4.3, the next patch is already getting ready to be launched and some bits of information about it are being shared by leakers. One example is the rumored addition of new areas in Genshin Impact’s best region. There are also some talks about a new deity being introduced during the upcoming Version, which is likely related to the aforementioned areas.




Of course, what usually gets the most attention among leaks is the presence of new playable characters. HoYoverse has confirmed that the human form of the adepti known as Cloud Retainer, called Xianyun, is finally being introduced as playable in Version 4.4. The confirmation came after a series of leaks that suggested her arrival. The upcoming patch is also going to add the brand new Gaming character, though he is expected to be a 4-star hero. Considering the leaked details about some of these characters’ gameplay abilities, the alleged structure of the upcoming Genshin Impact 4.4 Phase 1 banners suddenly makes a lot of sense.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   


 Xiao &amp; Xianyun Are Expected To Be In Genshin Impact 4.4’s Phase 1 Banners 
          




According to alleged leaks shared by Dimbreath on X, later reposted by a user on Reddit, the order of the character banners in Version 4.4 is set, and should feature Xiao and Xianyun in Phase 1, followed by Nahida and Yae Miko in Phase 2. This information is based on data found in the playtest version of the upcoming patch and, as pointed out by Dimbreath, could potentially be wrong or outdated. Cloud Retainer’s release in Genshin Impact 4.4 is mostly guaranteed following a post by HoYoverse, but the rest of the rerun characters are still unconfirmed. Xiao as Xianyun’s pair in Phase 1, however, makes perfect sense.



Character banner leaks, especially those of reruns, should be considered carefully. They are subject to change ahead of the update’s release and can often be wrong.






 Leaks Say That Xiao &amp; Xianyun Make For A Great Duo In Genshin Impact 
          




Based on gameplay leaks, Xiao and Xianyun are expected to be a great Anemo duo in the game. Xiao is a very reliant Anemo DPS in Genshin Impact, capable of inflicting high instances of damage at the cost of his own HP. Xianyun, on the other hand, is rumored to be an Anemo sub-DPS and support unit, capable of building up stacks and lowering the enemies’ Defense whenever a party member loses HP. As such, not only will she help trigger Swirl reactions and activate Resonance with Xiao being an Anemo character herself, Xianyun will be able to provide him with more damage output via DEF debuffs against opponents.

This is one of the reasons Xiao’s rerun in Genshin Impact 4.4 makes so much sense. The Anemo DPS is still one of the strongest in the game, but lost a lot of his usage due to other character releases and the establishment of a new meta with Dendro as a playable element. The release of Xianyun can help create new gameplay possibilities for Xiao, while also allowing players to control a new character, which has long been anticipated as a playable hero since the debut of her human form in 2023’s version of the Lantern Rite – even if it came through artwork rather than an in-game model.




Of course, Xiao’s rerun in Phase 1 is also backed up by the expectation that 2024’s Lantern Rite Festival will take place during the first few weeks of February rather than later into the month, leaning into the month of March. Lantern Rite Festivals tend to happen very early on in the year, and, based on previous years, Xiao is usually featured in at least one of the character banners during the event. As an important figure from Liyue, Xianyun is also likely to debut in Phase 1, which is when Lantern Rite should happen. The order can still be rearranged, however, so it is important to manage expectations.



Despite being featured as an important NPC in the first weeks of Version 4.3, Chevreuse only made her debut as a playable character with the arrival of the Phase 2 banners in Genshin Impact 4.3 – which made a lot of sense, considering the 5-star heroes she is accompanying.






 Other Genshin Impact 4.4 Banner Leaks So Far 
         




The other two characters rumored to rerun in the Phase 2 banners of Version 4.4 are Nahida and Yae Miko. At first glance, this seems more like a random assortment of 5-star heroes than anything related to a piece of story content, and that may as well be true. The Dendro Archon of Sumeru and the head of the Grand Narukami Shrine do not have much in common, other than the fact that they can operate quite well together in a Hyperbloom team comp in Genshin Impact. The two mentioned characters in the leaks may be accurate, though HoYoverse may surprise players by changing the expected heroes in Phase 2.

There is a chance for the developer to choose two 5-star heroes that make more sense when in a team comp with the new Pyro unit Gaming and his gameplay kit, should he actually debut in Phase 2. Yoimiya and Raiden Shogun’s choices for Version 4.3’s Phase 2 banners do not seem too randomized considering that Chevreuse debuted in Phase 2 and that her skills boost the power of Overloaded reactions in Genshin Impact – thus, adding her to banners with Pyro and Electro characters at the forefront is not at all surprising.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: New Skins May Be The Most Beautiful So Far   According to leaks, Genshin Impact will introduce two new skins in Version 4.4 - and they have the potential to be the most beautiful ones so far.   

As a character from the region of Liyue, Gaming may actually debut as a playable hero in Phase 1, going along with the Lantern Rite celebrations. At the moment, it is hard to tell if all the leaked rerun characters will be exactly those that appear in the final version of the update, but the Phase 1 structure built by Xiao and Xianyun as an Anemo duo powerhouse not only seems consistent, but promising for one of the best DPS characters in Genshin Impact.
