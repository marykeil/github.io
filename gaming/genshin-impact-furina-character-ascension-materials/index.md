## Literature Review

Ascending Furina is the best way of unlocking her full potential. Here is what you will need to max out the Hydro Archon’s level in Genshin Impact.





Furina is a 5-star support character capable of providing a DMG boost to her allies, while also offering some healing. The hero also has two distinct modes based on the Arkhe system. When in her Ousia form, Furina will actively attack opponents based on her Max HP, at the cost of her own teammates’ HP. In her Pneuma form, she will be able to restore lost HP. She is a tricky character to master but can be a decent addition to team comps well-knit team comps. Furina is also great for those who are already accustomed to characters who lose HP, such as Neuvillette or Wriothesley in Genshin Impact.




                  How To Play Genshin Impact On Steam   Although it is not traditionally available on the platform, players can actually play Genshin Impact on Steam, through one of two possible methods.    


 Materials For Furina’s Ascension In Genshin Impact 
         

According to Honey Hunter World, the first set of materials needed for Furina’s character Ascension is Varunada Lazurite Sliver and its enhanced forms, Fragments, Chunks, and Gemstones, respectively. These items can be obtained by facing weekly bosses in Genshin Impact, as well as some world bosses all across the playable regions of Teyvat.

These include creatures such as the Oceanid in the entrance to the region of Liyue, as well as the Hydro Hypostasis in Watatsumi Island, to the far west of the Inazuma region. You can also get Varunada Lazurite by converting other character Ascension materials at Crafting Bench. This is the easiest material to farm for Furina.






As the character’s level increases, the demands for item rarity also increase. To avoid farming too much, you will eventually need to use the Crafting Bench to transform 3x Slivers into 1x Fragment, 3x Fragments into 1x Chunk, and 3x Chunks into 1x Gemstone. This is valid for all other material families that have increasing rarities.




The second set of materials to farm is Lakelight Lily. This is a Local Speciality that can be found across several areas in Fontaine. The best spot to farm Lakelight Lily is near and within the Erinnyes Forest. This material was added with Genshin Impact 4.2, so it was impossible to pre-farm it before the release of the version. It may take some time to gather all that is needed for Furina’s full Ascension, as the space in which these spawn is limited, and Local Specialty respawn rates do not tend to be so forgiving. A great example of this is the Rukkhashava Mushroom in Genshin Impact.

The third set of materials needed for Furina’s Ascension is Whopperflower Nectar and its evolutions, Shimmering Nectar and Energy Nectar. These items drop exclusively from Whopperflowers, which are spread all across Teyvat. The final type of item for Furina is Water That Failed To Transcend, a new material that can be obtained as a drop from the Hydro Tulpas world boss. Like the Lakelight Lily, this item cannot be pre-farmed, as the boss itself was also added in Genshin Impact 4.2. Quite a few are needed, so you will likely need to face Hydro Tulpas multiple times.




The table below lists the materials needed for Furina’s Ascension in Genshin Impact, as well as the rewards per tier:

 Furina Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Genshin Impact   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    1x Varunada Lazurite Sliver   3x Whopperflower Nectar   3x Lakelight Lily   20,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 40 Ascension    3x Varunada Lazurite Fragment   15x Whopperflower Nectar   10x Lakelight Lily   2x Water That Failed To Transcend   40,000x Mora            Level 50 Ascension    6x Varunada Lazurite Fragment   12x Shimmering Nectar   20x Lakelight Lily   4x Water That Failed To Transcend   60,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 60 Ascension    3x Varunada Lazurite Chunk   18x Shimmering Nectar   30x Lakelight Lily   8x Water That Failed To Transcend   80,000x Mora            Level 70 Ascension    6x Varunada Lazurite Chunk   12x Energy Nectar   45x Lakelight Lily   12x Water That Failed To Transcend   100,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 80 Ascension    6x Varunada Lazurite Gemstone   24x Energy Nectar   60x Lakelight Lily   20x Water That Failed To Transcend   120,000x Mora            Total Materials    1x Varunada Lazurite Sliver   9x Varunada Lazurite Fragment   9x Varunada Lazurite Chunk   6x Varunada Lazurite Gemstone   18x Whopperflower Nectar   30x Shimmering Nectar   36x Energy Nectar   168x Lakelight Lily   46x Water That Failed To Transcend   420,000x Mora       3x Acquaint Fate      



In addition to the materials themselves, you will also need to utilize a fair share of Mora. A total of 420,000x Mora is needed to unlock all of Furina’s Ascension barriers. Additionally, you will need an extra 1,673,400 Mora to level the character in Genshin Impact. In case you require some extra Mora, you should farm the various Ley Line Outcrops - Blossoms of Wealth. Once you complete an activity, another one should spawn nearby, or at least inside the same nation you are currently in. You may be required to farm these in any case, since Talent leveling is a costly process in the game.






 All Of Furina’s Talent Materials In Genshin Impact 
          

One recurring material needed for Furina’s Talents in Genshin Impact, which was also needed for her Ascension process, is the Whopperflower Nectar and its evolved forms. The second set of materials needed to level up her abilities is the special Talent books. Furina uses Teachings, Guide, and Philosophies of Justice Talent books from Fontaine.

To farm these materials, you will need to challenge the Admonishing Engraving in the Domain of Mastery: Pale Forgotten Glory, which is located underwater, northeast of the island of Poisson. Because this Domain shares other drops, the Justice books only drop on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

As shown by Honey Hunter World, the next material needed for Furina’s Talents is an unknown weekly boss drop. This item is one of the potential drops from the new weekly boss in Genshin Impact known as the All-Devouring Narwhal. You will have to challenge this boss domain quite a few times to acquire the 18x pieces that are needed to level all three of Furina’s main abilities. This process may take some time, however, as there is a limit to weekly boss fights and their rewards. The table below lists everything that is needed for Furina’s Talents:




 Furina Talent Materials In Genshin Impact   Teachings of Justice    9x      Guide to Justice    63x      Philosophies of Justice    114x      Whopperflower Nectar    18x      Shimmering Nectar    66x      Energy Nectar    93x      Weekly Boss Material    18x      Crown of Insight    3x      Mora    4,957,500x      



You will also need a whopping amount of Mora to fully level all three of Furina’s abilities. Farming for the Hydro Archon is quite complicated, especially because her most important materials were impossible to pre-farm ahead of Version 4.2. Nevertheless, knowing exactly what to go after and dedicating your daily Resin toward an aligned goal will allow you to swiftly Ascend and enhance Furina in Genshin Impact.
