## Literature Review

Lilya has some of the best critical stats in Reverse: 1999, but she can be a tough-to-build main DPS thanks to her strict Psychube and team choices.





Lilya cannot convert her excess Crit Rate into Crit DMG, so players must be careful how much they invest in Crit Rate. However, if she can have teammates that reduce the enemy&#39;s critical resistance, Lilya can swoop in and knock their lights out. If you&#39;re willing to take the time to invest in her, Lilya is an excellent DPS in Reverse: 1999.

 The Best Psychubes For Lilya 
          

The trick with choosing a Psychube for Lilya is to carefully balance any possible critical bonuses they give. This is to avoid going above 100% Crit Rate. Thanks to Lilya&#39;s kit, she can obtain 100% Crit Rate with the right build and timing, but she cannot translate that excess Crit Rate into Crit DMG like other critical DPS characters in Reverse: 1999. Therefore, if you want to equip Lilya with a Critical Psychube, keep an eye on what precisely the Psychube can do to avoid wasting bonuses.

Thunderous Applause
As of Global Version 1.1 of Reverse: 1999, Thunderous Applause is the best fit Psychube for Lilya. This is one of the best Critical Psychubes available, providing a 16% Crit Rate bonus at Level 60. When Lilya&#39;s Ultimate or single-target attack Incantation scores a critical hit, she gets up to 32% more Crit DMG. This Psychube works better if Lilya has no teammates to help boost her critical stats.




An Afternoon Nap
If you don&#39;t have Thunderous Applause but still want a Critical Psychube, you can give Lilya An Afternoon Nap, Thunderous Applause&#39;s 5-Star twin. An Afternoon Nap provides a 13% Crit Rate bonus, which may work better for Lilya in a team comp that supports her critical attacks. Rather than one large Crit DMG bonus from the Amplification, Lilya gets a stack of &#43;3% Crit DMG each time she scores a single-target critical hit. She can hold up to eight stacks at any time for a total of 24% more Crit DMG.

Luxurious Leisure
Luxurious Leisure is the Psychube for a team comp with critical support characters. It provides an 18% Ultimate Might bonus, further supporting one of the best single-target Ultimates in Reverse: 1999. Once Lilya casts her Ultimate, she gets a stack of up to &#43;9% DMG Dealt. She can hold up to three stacks of this bonus, boosting both her regular and critical hits.

Brave New World
Since Lilya is a main DPS, if she needs a fourth Psychube option, she can wield Brave New World, which works for virtually all DPS units in Reverse: 1999. Brave New World is quite similar to Luxurious Leisure, with its 18% Ultimate Might bonus and Amplification triggered by said Ultimate. Here, the next Incantation Lilya uses following her Ultimate gets up to 40% more Incantation Might for a great extra punch.






 The Best Team Compositions For Lilya 
         

Part of the reason Lilya is tricky to build is that she needs a particular team comp to shine. Her best support and survival characters should have critical support skills. However, as of Version 1.1, there aren&#39;t many great options in that category. As more characters join the roster, bookmark any who can apply Confusion on enemies or any who can lower critical resistance or defense.

Voyager
Voyager from Reverse: 1999 is hands-down the best support character for Lilya, thanks to her wonderful debuff attack. Once her attack Incantation, Stellar Symphony, has two or more stars, Voyager can apply Confusion to two enemies. One stack of Confusion reduces the enemy&#39;s Critical Resistance by 25%. This opens the way for Lilya&#39;s incredible critical hits. Voyager&#39;s Interstellar Symphony and Sturdiness buffs also improve survivability and DMG output. With Insight, Voyager applies even more debuffs for crowd control. If you have the option, you should always pair Lilya with Voyager.




Erick
If you don&#39;t have Voyager and want a suitable budget replacement, Erick may be your go-to backup. Erick is a 4-Star offensive debuffer in Reverse: 1999, making her easy to pull compared to Voyager. She has her own debuff attack, like Voyager, that must reach two or more stars to prove effective. Erick can reduce a single target&#39;s Critical Resist Rate and Crit DEF by up to 30%. While this is weaker than Voyager and her Confusion stacks, it is still a great alternate option. Just be sure to bring along a survival character with good utility.

Bkornblume
Don&#39;t have either option? That&#39;s okay. Bkornblume may not be a perfect fit for Lilya, but she can synergize with Lilya&#39;s Reality-DMG. Bkornblume is specially crafted for Reality teams, as she can open enemies up to Reality DMG. By debuffing enemies and opening them up to Lilya, Bkornblume can also take advantage of a DMG bonus for her double-target attack, Watch Your Sleeves. So long as Bkornblume keeps her debuffs going, everyone on the team can benefit.




Medicine Pocket
There are few survival-oriented characters with critical support skills, so pair Lilya with a strong healer like Medicine Pocket for now. It&#39;s hard to find a team comp that doesn&#39;t need this brilliant healer. They have a strong healing Incantation and adjust the effectiveness of DMG across the field. They can reduce DMG Taken for allies and increase DMG Taken for enemies with their simple attack Incantation. Bring them along if you&#39;re lucky enough to have Medicine Pocket on your roster.

Balloon Party
Reverse: 1999&#39;s Balloon Party is the best backup healer to help out Lilya. Since Balloon Party heals based on a percentage of Lost HP, she can pull Lilya away from the brink of defeat. Her balloon buffs are also excellent for reducing DMG Taken, providing extra healing, and punishing enemies for attacking.

All in all, Balloon Party and the other Arcanists in this line-up are great for supporting Lilya and her critical aspirations in Reverse: 1999.
