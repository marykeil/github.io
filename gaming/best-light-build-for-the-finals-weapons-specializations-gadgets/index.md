## Literature Review

The Light class is the fastest option in The Finals. A good build can sneak in, kill several targets, and get out without being attacked back.





While there are recommended builds, there is no overall best. You want to adjust your build to counter-pick enemy teams or even single troublesome players. The Finals released suddenly during The Game Awards 2023, so the player base is still experimenting with the gameplay meta. It is highly unlikely to find all kinds of builds and team combinations out in the wild.




                  10 Things The Finals Does Better Than Other FPS Games   The Finals is a brand-new F2P first-person shooter holding its open beta and has a ton of things that other FPS games seem to seriously lack.

Classes in The Finals are customized with three main components: Weapons, Specialization, and Gadgets. New accounts will start with some of these options unlocked, but new ones require spending the basic in-game currency called VR. Because farming can take some time, you want to purchase the best abilities first.



VR is gained by playing matches. Winners of a game will receive bonus VR, as will the overall MVP - even if they were on a losing team. VR should not be confused with Multibucks, the premium currency used only for cosmetics like skins and charms.







  Ability Name   Ability Type   Function    M11   Main Weapon   High rate of fire SMG. 40 rounds. Best used for groups of enemies.    V9S   Main Weapon   Semi-automatic pistol. 20 rounds. Has a suppressor for quiet shots. Excellent for killing single enemies.    Sword   Main Weapon   High-damage melee weapon. The Sword can be charged to quickly kill other Lights and heavily injure other classes.    Cloaking Device   Specialization   Become invisible while standing still and only slightly visible while moving.   



  Ability Name   Ability Type   Function    Grappling Hook   Specialization   Launch into the sky and land on roofs. Good for evading or ambushing foes.    Flashbang   Gadget   Blinds all nearby characters, both enemies and friendly, that get in the blast radius.    Goo Grenade   Gadget   A powerful gadget that blocks the area in goo that is hard to destroy.    Stun Gun   Gadget   Paralyzes a single enemy for a few seconds.   





There are multiple equipment options due to having a Reserve Loadout. This allows you access to a second build that can be accessed after dying or between matches. So you will want to have one build focused on the Cloaking Device and another on the Grappling Hook. Switch around to the M11, V9s, or Sword based on the rest of your teamâ€™s loadout and class makeup.







With a build focused on sneaking and fast attacks, you should be able to rack up lots of kills in The Finals. Just be sure to know when to get out of danger. Leave the harder encounters to the Heavy players and flank just when the time is right.
