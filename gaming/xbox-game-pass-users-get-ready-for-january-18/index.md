## Literature Review

Something big is coming to Game Pass and Xbox Series X/S consoles on January 18. Hereâ€™s what it is, how to see it, and what to expect from it.




Anyone interested in what&#39;s coming to the Xbox Game Pass service and Xbox Series X/S consoles in 2024 should mark their calendars for January 18. Although the year has just begun, developers and publishers alike are already gearing up to make some major announcements. 2023 was packed full of incredible game releases, so 2024 has big shoes to fill. Microsoft is starting off early with a spate of new reveals to be made on January 18.




According to a blog post on Xbox Wire, on January 18, 2024, Xbox official social media channels will stream a game showcase, Developer_Direct &#39;24, focusing on news from some of its development studios on their upcoming games. The Developer_Direct is set to begin at 3 PM ET (12 PM PT, or 8 PM GMT), streaming on Xbox&#39;s YouTube and Twitch channels, and should last about an hour. It&#39;ll lead directly into Zenimax&#39;s The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal, which is expected to provide a little more information on the next expansion coming to the fantasy MMO.

                  10 Most Anticipated Xbox Series X/S Games Of 2024   2023 has been a banner year for acclaimed video game releases, but 2024 has plenty in store for the Xbox Series X/S consoles, including exclusives.   


 Everything Confirmed For Xbox&#39;s Developer_Direct &#39;24 
New Reveals From Obsidian, Ninja Theory, MachineGames, And Oxide Games
         




As it&#39;s focusing mainly on games developed by Microsoft-owned studios, the Developer_Direct will check in on the progress of multiple games currently in production. Avowed, Obsidian&#39;s fantasy RPG set in the Pillars of Eternity universe, is expected to show off its first-ever gameplay reveal. There will also be a behind-the-scenes preview of Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2, the sequel to 2017&#39;s cinematic adventure. Players can also expect an update on Ara: History Untold, a grand strategy game by the creators of Civilization V. MachineGames will also provide a first look at its upcoming Indiana Jones game.

But of course, those are only four games to fill an hour-long time slot, so there will doubtless be many other surprises during the showcase. Whether those will be brand-new announcements, updated trailers for already-announced games, or more highly anticipated Game Pass drops remains to be seen.

Microsoft has a lot to celebrate this year: fresh off its Activision-Blizzard acquisition in October 2023, there&#39;s a whole host of classic hit series now under Microsoft&#39;s banner. Game Pass keeps racking up incredible titles, with Hell Let Loose, Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla, and the remake of Resident Evil 2 all coming as part of its first batch of games in 2024. As it turns out, there&#39;s a lot more coming to Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Series X/S consoles soon, much of which will be revealed at the Developer_Direct on January 18.
