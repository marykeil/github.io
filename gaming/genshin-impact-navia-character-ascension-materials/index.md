## Literature Review

Here is everything you will need to farm over the course of a few weeks to fully Ascend the 5-star Navia and her Talents in Genshin Impact.





Navia’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact had already hinted at her being a main DPS in team comps, and that has been somewhat confirmed after the character’s official reveal by HoYoverse during the Version 4.3 livestream. Most of the leaked information about Navia was accurate: she uses a claymore in battle and excels at triggering Crystallize reactions, which, in turn, amplifies the power of her attacks. Before being able to put her to good use, however, you will need to ascend and increase Navia’s level to 90, so that the build around her is at its maximum potential. This will require some farming around Fontaine.




                  Genshin Impact Natlan Release Date Predictions (Based On Past Updates)   Although HoYoverse has not revealed the release date for Natlan in Genshin Impact, it is possible to predict exactly when it will arrive.   


 Ascension Materials To Farm For Navia In Genshin Impact 
         

The first set of materials you will need to farm to Ascend Navia is the Geo-based elemental stones, Prithiva Topaz. Because of how demanding characters get as they gradually level up, you will need some Prithiva Topaz Slivers, Fragments, Chunks, and Gemstones. These can be gathered as rewards from various activities and events but can be farmed from opponents that work with Geo. This includes the Geo Hypostasis and Primo Geovishap in Liyue, the Golden Wolflord and Perpetual Mechanical Array in Inazuma, and the weekly boss Azhdaha in Genshin Impact. You can also buy some from the Souvenir Shop and use Alchemy to transform other stones into Prithiva Topaz.






The items and amounts required for Navia’s Ascension were registered by Project Amber ahead of the character’s release, which means there could be a slight variation in what is needed.




Other materials for Navia are part of the Transoceanic Pearl family. Transoceanic Pearl, Transoceanic Chunk, and Xenochromatic Crystal can be obtained from Fontemer Aberrants spread across the region of Fontaine. This includes creatures above ground and underwater. Some examples are the Armored Crabs and Blubberbeasts that can be found on beaches, or Bubbler Seahorses and Hunter’s Ray that swim in the underwater sections of Genshin Impact. Like the elemental stones, this is an item family with increasing rarities that will need to be transformed to attend to the needs imposed by Ascension. You should farm a surplus of these items, as they will also be used for Navia’s Talents.

Like any other character undergoing Ascension, Navia requires a Local Specialty. In this case, you must farm Spring of the First Dewdrop. This item can only be acquired in Fontaine. To be more specific, it is located mostly underwater in the Morte Region. There are currently 75 clusters to be collected. This means that you will need to run the entire farming route a little over two times to get all the 168 required for Navia’s complete Ascension, which will unlock the ability to get her to level 90 in Genshin Impact. This item is not part of a family with varying rarities.




The last item you will need to farm in order to fully Ascend Navia is Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius. These are drops from the Icewind Suite: Nemesis of Coppelius boss fight. You should be wary that this boss has two distinct forms, and only the aforementioned one drops the necessary material to push Navia to level 90. The table below lists all of Navia’s needs for Ascension, divided by level, with a complete rundown of everything that is required, and the rewards you get per level threshold:

 Navia Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Genshin Impact   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    1x Prithiva Topaz Sliver   3x Transoceanic Pearl   3x Spring of the First Dewdrop   20,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 40 Ascension    3x Prithiva Topaz Fragment   15x Transoceanic Pearl   10x Spring of the First Dewdrop   2x Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius   40,000x Mora     -   Level 50 Ascension    6x Prithiva Topaz Fragment   12x Transoceanic Chunk   20x Spring of the First Dewdrop   4x Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius   60,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 60 Ascension    3x Prithiva Topaz Chunk   18x Transoceanic Chunk   30x Spring of the First Dewdrop   8x Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius   80,000x Mora     -   Level 70 Ascension    6x Prithiva Topaz Chunk   12x Xenochromatic Crystal   45x Spring of the First Dewdrop   12x Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius   100,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 80 Ascension    6x Prithiva Topaz Gemstone   24x Xenochromatic Crystal   60x Spring of the First Dewdrop   20x Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius   120,000x Mora     -   Total Materials    1x Prithiva Topaz Sliver   9x Prithiva Topaz Fragment   9x Prithiva Topaz Chunk   6x Prithiva Topaz Gemstone   18x Transoceanic Pearl   30x Transoceanic Chunk   36x Xenochromatic Crystal   168x Spring of the First Dewdrop   46x Artificed Spare Clockwork Component – Coppelius   420,000x Mora       3x Acquaint Fate      






In addition to the materials per si, you will also need a good amount of Mora to get through the Ascension thresholds and fueling leveling with Character EXP materials. Not too much is needed, especially when compared to how much is consumed by Navia’s Talents, but it may be lacking. In case you need more Mora in Genshin Impact, you can farm Ley Line Outcrop - Blossom of Wealth. Simply initiate the challenge and continue to follow the path until it is exhausted.



While 420,000 Mora is what you need to unlock all the Ascension barriers, a total of 1,673,400 Mora is consumed when using Character EXP materials to level Navia between these barriers.






 Materials For Navia’s Talents (Abilities) In Genshin Impact 
          

After getting Navia to level 90, the next step is to increase the level of her Talents. This is the most demanding and expensive part of the process. The first materials you will need to gather are Transoceanic Pearl, Transoceanic Chunk, and Xenochromatic Crystal, which were also used for her Ascension and drop from Fontemer Aberrants. A very large amount is needed to get all her Talents to level 10, so it may take a few days or even weeks to gather up the materials. This is also true when considering the other materials Navia consumes when leveling her Talents in Genshin Impact.




Navia’s Talent books are the Fontaine-based Equity ones. Teachings of Equity, Guide to Equity, and Philosophies of Equity can be farmed in the Pale Forgotten Glory Domain, but only on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays. They are occasionally rewarded for participating in events in Fontaine, but the most stable source for farming is from the Domain itself. This is the same set of Talent books used by Lyney’s Talents in Genshin Impact, so if you farmed for him, you may have some leftovers for Navia to use.

You will also need to farm a decent sum of Lightless Silk String. This is a material that drops from a weekly boss so, even though only 18 pieces are required to level all three of Navia’s Talents to 10, the weekly limitation on boss challenges may set you back from fully upgrading her kit by a few weeks. Regardless, this item can drop when beating the All-Devouring Narwhal in Genshin Impact.



The boss also has a chance of dropping Lightless Mass and Lightless Eye of the Maelstrom, but these can be transformed into Lightless Silk String in the Crafting Bench.







To reach the final level in each of Navia’s Talents, you will also need Crown of Insight. As such, only three are needed, but this is an extremely rare material that can only be obtained through limited-time events and offering systems. The process of leveling Navia’s Talents is very expensive and will see you put back by nearly 5 million Mora. The table below lists everything you need to get all three of Navia’s main Talents to level 10:

 Navia Talent Materials In Genshin Impact   Teachings of Equity    9x      Guide to Equity    63x      Philosphies of Equity    114x      Transoceanic Pearl    18x      Transoceanic Chunk    66x      Xenochromatic Crystal    93x      Lightless Silk String    18x      Crown of Insight    3x      Mora    4,957,500x      






The process of Ascending and leveling both Navia and her Talents is a time-consuming one, especially considering how much farming you need to do. Nevertheless, this is one of the best ways of unlocking her native potential as a Geo DPS on the field, which can be a great alternative for those who do not want to use Arataki Itto and his somewhat complicated DEF-based build in Genshin Impact.
