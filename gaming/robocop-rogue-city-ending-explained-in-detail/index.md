## Literature Review

RoboCop: Rogue City is a phenomenal game that gives the player plenty of choice. Perhaps the most important decision they can make - how it all ends.




The RoboCop franchise has notoriously struggled to make the transition to Video Games; however, this trend has been shattered with RoboCop: Rouge City. Developed by Teyon, RoboCop: Rouge City is a great game and everything an adaptation could wish to be. Set between the events of RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3, RoboCop: Rouge City sees the titular cyborg embark on a journey in Old Detroit in which he seeks to clean up the city by taking on gangs and dangerous criminals. Furthermore, the decisions RoboCop makes, have serious repercussions throughout the game, one of the most important decisions comes right at the end - what to do with the final boss.

At the end of the game, after entering the OCP headquarters, RoboCop comes upon Max Becker being held by the neck by the game&#39;s final boss, the imposing robot, Old Man. The Old Man is an iconic antagonist in the RoboCop franchise, the former CEO of OCP, in Rouge City, he has undergone a procedure to implant his consciousness into RoboCop2 - a dangerous combination of evil and power. After Old Man crushes Becker&#39;s throat he tosses the lifeless body across the room before turning his attention to RoboCop. After RoboCop offers him the &#34;Scrapyard or Prison&#34;, Old Man blasts RoboCop through the floor and then begins the game&#39;s final battle.

 Terminate Old Man Ending 
The Good Ending
         




The first of the three options available to the player following defeating the final boss, Old Man, is to kill him. After being crushed by an enormous block of falling debris, Old Man lies immobile, engulfed in flames and sparks. Though not yet dead, it is clear that he has been bested, and is in no position, or state, to escape the crumbling building. Despite this, selecting the option &#34;Kill Him&#34; will see RoboCob nonchalantly walk to his defeated adversary, rip a reinforcing bar from the concrete, and thrust it through Old Man&#39;s outstretched hand - an action that elicits a roar, seemingly of pain, from the downed machine final boss.

                  &#34;A Great Game &amp; Everything An Adaptation Could Wish For&#34; - RoboCop: Rogue City Review   Robocop: Rogue City delivers an inspired and enthusiastic take on the classic franchise, even if some of its budgetary constraints are apparent.     

After this, RoboCop walks behind Old Man and maneuvers his body to expose the cables that give him life. Ripping these electronic, fluid, and oil lines causes Old Man to spark and smoke, makes his head fall to the ground, and almost immediately causes him to shut down for good. This ending in RoboCop: Rogue City is undoubtedly the game&#39;s good ending. The final boss gets what he deserves and RoboCop succeeds in his mission.






 Save Old Man Ending 
The Bad Ending
          

After the debris falls on Old Man, and Anna Lewis instructs RoboCop to get out of the crumbling building, he refutes her plea and proclaims &#34;There is one more person here that needs saving.&#34; Following this, RoboCop, to the surprised grunts of Old Man and the disbelief of Anna, dislodges a monolithic slab of concrete from atop his fallen adversary, helping him to his feet, and saving him from certain death in the impending collapse.

                  How Rogue City&#39;s RoboCop Will Be Different From Mortal Kombat 11&#39;s   RoboCop: Rogue City, an upcoming first-person shooter, will feature RoboCop in a new light and will be very different from Mortal Kombat 11.    

His good deed almost results in RoboCop falling victim to the still caving-in building; however, Old Man, in a gesture of appreciation, sacrifices himself to push the protagonist out of the way of plummeting debris - ultimately making RoboCop&#39;s heroic feet meaningless as the falling rubble crushes and subsequently kills Old Man. RoboCop&#39;s typically emotionless &#34;Thank You&#34; seems like a fitting response to this, the game&#39;s bad ending. Furthermore, while RoboCop is a morally motivated figure, and the actions in this ending are not out of character, the fact that his actions make no difference in the end, other than perhaps redeeming Old Man, makes this the game&#39;s saddest ending too.






 Leave Old Man Ending 
The True Ending
         

The third option available to RoboCop is the neutral ending - leave the defeated final boss to his inescapable fate. In this ending, after the wreckage falls and traps Old Man, RoboCop simply surveys the situation and walks away. While Old Man roars, almost in a symbolic call for help, the camera shifts to an angle that shows RoboCop casually strolling toward the off-camera exit. As he gets closer to the camera&#39;s POV an enormous mound of detritus collapses and violently smashes down upon Old Man - his roars replaced by the cacophony of crashing concrete before fading into an eerie silence.

This ending option could be regarded as the true ending as it seems to be the most appropriate conclusion to RoboCop: Rogue City, both thematically and narratively. RoboCop has been given orders by Anna to vacate the premises and his analytic programming would help him recognize that killing Old Man would be gratuitous and unnecessary as his chances of survival are negligible, and saving him is excessively dangerous given the less-than-stable condition of the building. While not the most visually or narratively exciting ending in RoboCop: Rogue City the Leave Old Man ending is quite possibly the most thematically appropriate.






 An Unavoidable Finale 
The Epilogue
          

No matter which ending the player chooses in RoboCop: Rouge City, the game does not conclude with the death of Old Man. After the concrete falls there is an additional part of the cut scene in which the building is shown to fully collapse from the perspective of Channel 9 reporter Samantha Ortiz. While it is temporarily ambiguous if he has survived, RoboCop heroically strides out of the smoking rubble, battered and scared, but very much still active. Following this comes a Mediabreak in which the newscaster delivers a narrative-rich voice-over concerning the current state of OCP, a number of the game&#39;s main characters, and most importantly (and depressingly) RoboCop.

During the Mediabreak section concerning RoboCop, it is made clear that his actions have had positive consequences on his public support and the citizens of Old Detroit continue to view him as a protector - one interviewee explains that she hopes OCP doesn&#39;t take him off the street as he is the only thing keeping them safe. However, the voice-over explains that Mayor Kuzak has distanced himself from RoboCop and has refused to endorse or advocate granting the cyborg crime fighter his human rights. The revelation of the Mayor&#39;s refusal to afford this public hero his human rights unfortunately puts a dampener on each of the endings in RoboCop: Rogue City.
