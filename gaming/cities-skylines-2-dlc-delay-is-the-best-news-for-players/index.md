# Cities Skylines 2 DLC Delay Is The Best News For Players


## SUMMARY 



  Cities: Skylines 2 launched with numerous bugs and issues, prompting the developers to prioritize patches and fixes.   The previously announced DLC roadmap for the game has been delayed to ensure the game reaches a satisfactory level before additional content is released.   The developers are focused on improving performance, addressing bugs, and providing editor/modding support, with longer-term patches and fixes taking priority over quick fixes.

## Literature Review

Many DLC packs that had been announced as coming to Cities: Skylines 2 in the next year are now being delayed, but that is good news for the game.




Cities: Skylines 2 has had a rocky launch, with multiple bugs and problems arising in the game that required its developers to rush in putting out patches to repair everything. Now, the previously announced roadmap of planned DLC for the coming year is going to be facing delays, but this is a good thing for fans of the city-building game. As many have already pointed out, perhaps the entire launch of Cities: Skylines 2 would have benefited from being delayed as well, so extending the roadmap for additional content seems like a wise choice.




Cities: Skylines 2 was a massive undertaking, with many promises made that were very ambitious from the start. The depth of mechanics that a resource manager and city-building game such as this requires is already a lot, and Cities: Skylines 2 features a heavy focus on even the smallest details. This is to the developer&#39;s credit, yet, it also makes many extra possibilities for things to go wrong or require a lot from the systems that a game may be played on. While Cities: Skylines 2 will be a wonderful foundation to build upon for many years, currently it is hindered by many game-breaking issues.

 DLC Is On Hold Until Game Improvements Are Implemented 
Patches &amp; Fixes Take Priority
         

In a November 20 announcement on the Paradox Forums from the CEO of Colossal Order, Mariina Hallikainen, it was stated that the team for Cities: Skylines 2 is working on improving the foundational concerns for the base game and digging into the more difficult issues that require some extended work. All the previously planned-out DLC which was expected over the first half of 2024 will still be arriving in the future, but it is going to be temporarily postponed until the game is at a satisfactory level.





Mariina Hallikainen: &#34;Once the PC version is where we want it to be, we will be focusing on the console release and DLC content. We are committed to bringing the marketed DLC content to you, but it will not be landing in the originally promoted schedule.&#34;


Hallikainen also said that the priorities for everyone at Colossal Order are focused on performance improvements, bug fixing, and editor/modding support. The performance problems in Cities: Skylines 2 have been a frustrating fact that many players have struggled with since the game was released. Currently, the devs say they are working on improving the GPU and CPU performance to improve the overall experience for everyone, particularly once cities begin to grow larger and grander.

 Patches Will Come Less Frequently As Larger Issues Are Addressed 
Weekly Patches Were Quick Fixes
          




Since the launch of Cities: Skylines 2 on October 24, 2023, there have been patches and bug fixes applied at a rapid pace in an attempt to quickly appease players and solve the easier issues. Now, the team at Colossal Order will begin to focus on the larger problems that will take more time to repair but will also have much better results. This will mean that patches will not be coming as quickly, but developers are not slowing down in their efforts to improve the game&#39;s quality. They are still recommending players who have difficulties report any matters on the official forums so that problems can be addressed and rectified quickly.



Bug fixes and small issues will remain a high priority even while the team is going to work on larger matters.




Modding for Cities: Skylines 2 is going to be supported through its own in-game tools, Paradox Mods, but this editor is also still in the beta testing phase. Beta groups are currently trying the promised map editor for the game, which is reportedly seeing some struggles with complicated water placement commands. The release schedule for this map editor and other modding supports currently do not have an updated release schedule until performance and bugs are worked on first.

 Announced Cities: Skylines 2 DLC Is Still Coming 
Delayed To An Unspecified Release Window
          

One of the first DLC asset packs, Beach Properties, has already been worked on by artists and outside partners of the team, but is being held until the fundamental parts of Cities: Skylines 2 are repaired and working properly first. This way, there will not be any added possibilities of new problems piling on top of a broken foundation, and the new DLC content will be able to be a smooth addition to celebrate the mended game. Currently, the announced roadmap of DLC packs for the game was going to introduce four new asset and expansion packs over the first half of 2024, but now this is being extended to an unknown period. These include:

  Beach Properties: Asset pack to provide items for players to make luxurious beachfront housing for their citizens.   Urban Promenades: Asset pack that will add more than 30 items to customize cities with.   Modern Architecture: Another asset pack to add more than 30 additional items for customizing cities with a more modern feel.   Bridges &amp; Ports: An expansion pack that gives tools to create a port city with new buildings such as draw bridges and lighthouses. Will contain over 100 assets and a new economy feature of Marine Industries.  




For many, going from the original Cities: Skylines to this sequel, which does not have the extra benefits of almost a decade&#39;s worth of DLC and mods, has felt a bit lackluster in the lessened amount of content, even on top of the gameplay issues that they may be facing. The promise of expansion content in the coming months may have helped to lessen that sting, yet in the long run, these delays will still be for everyone&#39;s benefit. Having the performance issues and bugs repaired correctly and being able to present Cities: Skylines 2 as a functioning game needs to take precedence and will ultimately make for a better foundation for mods and DLCs when they are able to come.
