## Literature Review

Walton&#39;s Treasure Hunt is a quest you can find in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as you explore Korok Forest, and complete to earn three rare items.





Before you can access this quest, you have to free the Korok Forest after you get through the Lost Woods in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This is done by traveling into the large Chasm at the center of the Woods, where Link must take down fearsome enemies. Only when you defeat the Gloom Hands and Phantom Ganon at the base of the Chasm can you begin to pursue the treasure hunt mission.




                  The Next Zelda Should Learn From BOTW &amp; TOTK, But Skip One Key Feature   Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom brought a lot of new features to the Zelda series, but the next game should skip one key feature.   


 How To Find Walton The Korok 
          

Walton can be found at the top of the Deku Tree once it has begun to recover from the Gloom poison that once spread throughout the area. Many Koroks you will encounter here have small tasks they would like Link to do, but these are small goals compared to what Walton wants in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.



Now that the Korok Forest is all better, it will become the final landing spot for Hestu in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. So anytime Link needs to trade Korok Seeds, he will now need to look here instead of Lookout Landing.







                  Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - How To Beat Phantom Ganon (Deku Tree Chasm)   Phantom Ganon is a boss featured several times in TOTK, including in the Deku Tree Chasm, but facing him will first require beating the Gloom Hands.   

While you could climb the Deku Tree by carefully scaling the trunk of the enormous plant, this can only be done if Link&#39;s Stamina has multiple rings. Thankfully, you can use one of Link&#39;s new abilities in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to bypass the challenging heights of the Tree. The Ascend skill lets Link pass through the bottom of surfaces and emerge on top of them, letting them move up without expending Stamina.

Go to the center of the Deku Tree, where all the Koroks are setting up shops from which Link can buy a few items. Ascend through the ceiling to find a Korok who will tell you that the area you&#39;ve reached is called the mouth of the Deku Tree. Unfortunately, the Korok here isn&#39;t Walton, but you can do a quick quest from this NPC in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.




Find a spot in the mouth where Ascend can be used again, then dart up past the trunk of the Tree once more in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The spot where Link emerges will also host Walton, giving Link the chance to start his treasure hunt mission.



 Where To Find The Forest Dweller&#39;s Spear and Sword 
         

When you find and talk to Walton, the first thing he will ask you is to find hidden objects around the Deku Tree, with the first two being the Forest Dweller&#39;s Spear and Sword. These two items are requested simultaneously, but Link needs to know their location. Walton tells you that the Spear and Sword can be found above the Deku Tree&#39;s face in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

The Spear is right behind Walton, making it the easiest item to find in this quest. On the other hand, the Sword rests beyond the Korok, in an area you can reach by climbing the small piece of park past Walton after you talk to him. You should spot the blade&#39;s hilt sticking out from the Tree, ready for you to collect and bring back.




Walton will ask for an evaluation of how hard it was for Link to find each item they bring back in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. How you respond doesn&#39;t matter; you only need to bring back the items Walton requested. You could accomplish this one object at a time or collect everything he asks for and return it all at once.



 Where To Find The Forest Dweller&#39;s Shield 
          

The last item Walton will ask for is the Forest Dweller&#39;s Shield, which the Korok claims is beneath the Deku Tree&#39;s face. You won&#39;t be able to find the Shield on the ground or within the Tree itself, so return to the place with the Korok merchants near the Chasm. Before entering this space, you can see the item you&#39;re looking for as a distant glint above you.

In the top left corner of the Deku Tree&#39;s naval entrance, you can collect the Shield as the final item in the treasure hunt. Use Ascend once again to reach Walton and rate how hard it was to find this particular gear. Doing this will lead to a final conversation with Walton in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, where he gives Link a few rewards.






 Walton&#39;s Treasure Hunt Reward 
          

The reward for completing &#34;Walton&#39;s Treasure Hunt&#34; is that Link gets to keep each of the items they found in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The Forest Dweller&#39;s Sword, Spear, and Shield are all kept within your inventory to use as you please. Both weapons are unique from other tools in the game, with a trait that encourages the Fuse mechanic prevalent throughout the game.

Many materials that can only be used once in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be recovered after a single use when attached to the Forest Dweller weapons. With the Sword&#39;s Base Power of 7 and the Spear&#39;s Base Power of 6, you have two damaging weapons that have lasting versatility. For example, if you put a Puffshroom on the Spear, the additional effects from that fused item won&#39;t leave until the weapon breaks.




                  Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 10 Best Shields (&amp; How To Get Them)   Bringing a strong Shield into a tough fight in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is vital for survival. Out of the 34 Shields, here are the best 10.    

The Shield does not have this feature, but it can still be an important item that protects Link with a Base Defense Power of 30. This item is more durable than other shields in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, giving you plenty of protection as you encounter increasingly dangerous situations in Hyrule.

Link also receives the wooden Forest Dweller&#39;s Bow from this mission, which has a Base Power of 15 and can fire three arrows at once. The strong gear you earn by completing &#34;Walton&#39;s Treasure Hunt&#34; in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom makes this a quest you should pursue when you cleanse the area around the Deku Tree.

               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017.
