## Literature Review

November 29th’s Wordle answer will cause problems as it contains a repeating letter and multiple vowels. However, some hints might help solve it.





Wordle’s hard mode isn’t as challenging as the name suggests. Instead, this mode only prevents players from using random guesses. The harder mode does not let players reuse confirmed letters in other spots, which is ideal for discovering repeating letters and multiple vowels. However, this mode can still prove challenging for some. Therefore, some players might need to use a hint if they are on their last few attempts.
