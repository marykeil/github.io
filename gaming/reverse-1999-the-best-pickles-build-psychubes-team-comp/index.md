## Literature Review

Pickles may be a border collie, but he is also one of the most versatile characters in Reverse: 1999, working as both a main and sub DPS character.





Pickles can also work as a sub-DPS thanks to the benefits of his Ultimate, Thus Says Pickles. When Pickles casts his Ultimate, he increases the DMG Dealt for all allies by 30% for two rounds (three rounds if he has Clarified Topic). While this may be one of his only utilities, he is an incredible addition to Reverse: 1999&#39;s Version 1.1.

 The Best Psychubes For Pickles 
          

Pickles can make many different Psychubes work thanks to the strength of his attacks. Since his Ultimate and one of his Incantations are single-target attacks, he can benefit from Psychubes with a single-target trigger. He also works well with Psychubes that ask him to defeat enemies, whether you build him as a main DPS or support DPS.

Luxurious Leisure
Luxurious Leisure works well for Pickles thanks to its single-target Amplification trigger. Only a few characters in Reverse: 1999 can use this Psychube, further supporting the decision to pair it with Pickles. The Amplification builds off his single-target Ultimate and its DMG Dealt bonus. Here, Pickles gets a stack of &#43;9% DMG Dealt following his Ultimate. He can get up to three of these stacks. Meanwhile, Luxurious Leisure also provides an 18% Ultimate Might bonus, encouraging Pickles to build his Moxie and cast Thus Says Pickles.




Hopscotch
For a more active play style, Hopscotch may be better for Pickles. This Psychube asks Pickles to last-hit his enemies to get a stack of up to 8% Ultimate Might. He can collect four stacks of Ultimate Might for a total of 32% more Ultimate Might. If his base stats aren&#39;t enough to take enemies down, Hopscotch helps Pickles with an Incantation Might bonus of up to 18%. It&#39;s a great Psychube if you can obtain it.

Brave New World
When you want to use Pickles as a main DPS, you may prefer Brave New World over Hopscotch or Luxurious Leisure. This Psychube is great for characters who use their Ultimates because whenever the caster uses their Ultimate, their next Incantation gets 40% more Incantation Might. This is one of the biggest bonuses available from Psychubes in Reverse: 1999. Brave New World further boosts Pickles&#39; Ultimate by providing an 18% Ultimate Might bonus.

His Bounden Duty
If you plan only to use Pickles as a sub-DPS, give him His Bounden Duty for more utility. His Bounden Duty has a 12% DMG bonus for Pickles to utilize in all his attacks. He will have to defeat enemies to trigger the Amplification, but considering his kit, that should be pretty easy. Upon defeating an enemy, Pickles heals the whole team by up to 120% of his ATK. While this Amplification won&#39;t trigger a lot, it gives Pickles excellent survivability.






 The Best Team Compositions For Pickles 
         



Pickles is a well-rounded and versatile character, one of the few in the game who can be considered for multiple positions in a team comp. If he is a support character, he works well with AP-greedy DPS units. If he is the main DPS, he needs sturdy support who can fight while he rests and help boost his DMG potential.




Melania
Melania from Reverse: 1999 is one of the most AP-greedy characters in the game, making Pickles an excellent counterbalance to her kit. Her attacks can steal Moxie or HP from her enemies, making her a great DPS with many skills. She has her special buff like Pickles, but she gets it from her Ultimate rather than her Insight. Melania can work when Pickles is resting to charge his Clarified Topic.

Eternity
Another great main DPS option (if Pickles has His Bounden Duty) is Reverse: 1999&#39;s beautiful Eternity. Eternity is a unique character because each of her attacks takes 10% of her HP. In return, she can resist a wide range of debuffs and a variety of DMG Heal and Leech Rate skills. If Pickles can provide some extra healing, he can keep Eternity in the game while she provides extra support with her Nasty Wound debuff.




An-an Lee
If you want Pickles to be a main DPS, you will want to pair him with An-an Lee, the 6-Star Ghostbuster. She has a remarkable buff and a solid attack that, at three stars, also inflicts Daze on one target. She mainly synergizes with Pickles because of her switch between Exorcism Time and Break Time. Exorcism Time encourages her to attack, while Break Time has her step back. You can maintain a steady rhythm if you time these statuses with Pickles and his rest rounds.

Diggers
Diggers is another new character in Reverse: 1999&#39;s Version 1.1 who could work well with Pickles as a support unit. Diggers is a debuffer who can reduce enemy DEF, take away Moxie, and inflict both Weakness (lowering an enemy&#39;s DMG) and Nightmare (preventing enemies from attacking until attacked). This makes Diggers an excellent crowd-control unit that can hold enemies off while Pickles deals with other targets.

Medicine Pocket
Whether Pickles is a main DPS or support, you will probably want Medicine Pocket to accompany him. Their DMG may be a bit sad, but Medicine Pocket in Reverse: 1999 plays with DMG Taken on both sides of the battlefield, improving attack efficiency and survivability. Their healing is also incredibly impressive, as well as some of the game&#39;s best. It&#39;s hard to go wrong with Medicine Pocket.




There are a lot of team comps out there for Pickles, but fans love him (outside of his cute border collie face) because they can use him as they please, and he will rise to the occasion. He is undoubtedly one of the best characters available in Reverse: 1999.
