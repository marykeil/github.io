# Defeating Baldur Gate 3 s Grym Is Simple If You Do This Trick At The Adamantine Forge


## SUMMARY 



  Grym is one of the tougher bosses in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s first act, but there is a strategy to make it easy.   Having a druid in the party opens up the option to use Crushing Flight to deal over 1,000 damage to Grym under certain circumstances.   Halsin can be used for the strategy, but many parties may encounter Grym before Halsin becomes an active party member.

## Literature Review

The Adamantine Forge fight can be a big challenge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but there&#39;s one way to make an easy victory happen in the blink of an eye.




Grym can be a particularly tough boss in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it actually has the potential to be an easy fight if the right strategy is applied. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is all about strategy and thinking outside the box, and it&#39;s not uncommon for its most challenging encounters to feature unique opportunities that circumvent threats or deal enormous damage. Experimentation can be haphazard, however, and figuring out an effective way of taking on a challenge like Grym is rarely a simple process.




Grym is a construct that can be found at the Adamantine Forge, an optional area in Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that can be found when exploring the Underdark. It&#39;s not actually necessary to visit the forge at all, so it can be tempting to skip out on the fight and Grym&#39;s serious damage-dealing abilities to keep the main story moving. Although beating Grym in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 doesn&#39;t have a major impact on the narrative, both the fight and the forge offer some powerful equipment, so it&#39;s better to take on the challenge.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Grym Can Be Crushed In One Blow In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          




Traditional wisdom places the forge itself as an object of central importance when fighting Grym, as getting him to stand in the center of the crucible makes it possible to drop a massive hammer on him for bludgeoning damage. This is still far from enough to take down his entire health pool (300 on Balanced difficulty and 450 on BG3&#39;s challenging Tactician difficulty), however, and it&#39;s possible to outdo it by a significant margin. A Reddit post from chenvoso illustrates the superior method, which uses the enhanced weight of an owlbear to deal over 1,000 damage and eliminate Grym with room to spare.


 



 How The Owlbear Strategy Works Against Grym In BG3 
          




The key to this technique is the Crushing Flight ability that druids can use when taking on the form of an owlbear, which makes it possible to leap at an enemy to deal bludgeoning damage and knock them prone. Although this usually isn&#39;t an extraordinary amount of damage, it scales with height and weight, making it easy to abuse in the right scenarios. The crumbling ledge overhanging the Adamantine Forge and the Enlarge spell (or the Elixir of the Colossus that achieves the same effect) can serve to vastly increase both of these properties, resulting in a ridiculous but highly effective attack.

                  This BG3 Skill Finally Introduces D&amp;D Giants To Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Giants might not show up in any official capacity in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no way to make a giant happen in game.   

This isn&#39;t the only scenario where Crushing Flight can be put to great work in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it&#39;s rare to find opportunities that are so perfect. Of course, the strategy requires a druid in the active party, and most parties using the Adamantine Forge are likely to be doing so before Halsin can be officially recruited as a permanent member. Nonetheless, anyone with a druid character at the ready can only stand to gain from this powerful technique, as long as developer Larian Studios never sees fit to patch over this bit of excellent fun in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
