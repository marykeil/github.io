## Literature Review

Unearthed Arcana playtested many classes and subclasses that were never officially published, but PDFs can be found on Wizards of the Coast&#39;s website.




Over the past 50 years, Dungeons &amp; Dragons has had dozens of classes players could adopt for their characters, along with many more subclasses to choose from. The original game started with only three basic classes, the fighting-man, the cleric, and the magic-user. 5e has not added a new character class since 2020, when the artificer was published in Tasha&#39;s Cauldron of Everything, which brought the total number of official classes up to 13. However, there are many unreleased classes and subclasses that have been unofficially published as Unearthed Arcana playtests.
Unearthed Arcana itself dates back to 1985 when it was released as a collection of rules and content previously published in magazines and various other sources. Currently, the 2024 update to the 5e rules is being playtested as Unearthed Arcana through D&amp;D Beyond. Between 2015 and 2022, Wizards of the Coast used UA to release 5e playtest rules and content, including many really cool classes and subclasses that have not made it into the published version of DnD rules. They are, however, still available as PDFs on the Wizards of the Coast website.









 








 5  School Of Technomancy (Wizard Subclass) 
Hack &amp; Program Computers &amp; Spells
        

It may sound wild, but in 2015, Wizards of the Coast actually released a UA for playtesting called Modern Magic. In it, the school of technomancy was available for wizards, and it gave them the power to manipulate computers, online spaces, as well as &#34;craft disposable electronic devices and smartphone apps in lieu of potions and scrolls.&#34; Spells like invisibility to cameras, on/off, digital phantom, and arcane hacking fleshed out the technomagic caster.
This subclass would definitely not fit into most DnD campaigns. It would be out of place in every setting available for 5e. However, the point of this UA was to test how players responded to modernized content that was even more advanced than the extremely popular streampunk-like Eberron setting.





 4  Rune Scribe (Prestige Class) 
Only Available As A Multiclass
        

In Wizards&#39; UA titled Prestige Classes and Rune Magic, game designers put out feelers to see how the 5e playerbase would respond to prestige classes. Beginning with the third edition Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide, prestige classes are only available to characters who meet certain requirements, which means they cannot be chosen at character creation. The rune scribe requires a character of at least fifth level that has at least 13 Intelligence and Dexterity, proficiency with the Arcana skill, and has completed an in-story task of finding a teacher.
The class&#39;s base feature was inscribing a rune that would grant a simple property to anyone who held it, such as fire or cold resistance, and a complex property that only rune scribes could access such as dealing extra fire damage on a hit or gaining the ability to fly. Eventually, this basic idea of rune magic was refined over time and became the basis of the rune knight subclass for fighters and expanded even more in 2023&#39;s Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants. However, the overall idea of prestige classes and the rune scribe in particular were not well received by 5e players.

 3  The Raven Queen (Warlock Patron) 
A Servant Of Death Who Hates The Undead
        

A Forgotten Realms deity who has made her way into Critical Role&#39;s Exandria, the Raven Queen is a god of death from the Shadowfell. She abhors the undead and seeks to preserve the natural order of life and death. As a warlock patron in Wizards of the Coast&#39;s Warlock &amp; Wizard Unearthed Arcana, she compels her followers to do the same. Not only is the Raven Queen patron still available as a UA PDF, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players can simply install a mod from Nexus Mods user GladoffelLp to gain her favor.
The coolest part of having her as a patron is that the warlock begins with a raven familiar that is significantly better than the one conjured by the find familiar spell because it grants darkvision and bonuses to perception and other skills and can&#39;t be targeted by others&#39; spells as long as it perches on the warlock&#39;s shoulder. At sixth level, the Raven Queen grants the player the ability to merge with that raven, almost like a druid&#39;s Wild Shape ability but without a set number of charges. That&#39;s an incredibly powerful ability on its own, and at higher levels, she grants bonuses on death saves, condition immunities, and damage resistance.

 2  Oath Of Treachery (Paladin Subclass) 
A Dark Paladin Without Breaking An Oath


 







In most DnD games, including Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, in order to play a dark paladin, the player must break their oath. There are specific rules for the oathbreaker paladin subclass in the 5e Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide. However, a 2016 UA, Paladins, offers the option of eschewing the selfless life and protecting others: &#34;Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are only faithful to themselves.&#34; The cool part is that the oath of treachery is offered as an alternative to the oathbreaker subclass in the UA itself, not a replacement or revision.
At level seven, the paladin gains an ability called Cull the Herd, which works as a reverse pack tactic, granting advantage on creatures that are next to their allies. Their Channel Divinity charges can be used to conjure a duplicate that works similarly to the echo knight subclass for the fighter from 2020&#39;s Explorer&#39;s Guide to Wildemount. At level 15, they can turn invisible and teleport within 60 feet, and at 20, they can become an avatar of deceit, so they can control another creature&#39;s action if it hurts the player character, gain another way to go invisible, and do bonus damage based on their level.





 1  The Mystic (Class) 
A Fully Psionics-Based Class
        

Psionics is one of the most beloved elements of DnD, and it is almost entirely missing from 5e. A school of abilities completely separated from magic, psionics draws power from the mind itself rather than the arcane. Some 5e abilities and feats draw heavily on the aesthetic of psionics, but none of them are what psionics were in older editions. The Mystic Class Unearthed Arcana delineates a psionics class that went through multiple iterations of playtesting, but never made the cut for official publication. It is a very complicated class with a lot to keep track of, and the mechanics did not stray far enough from existing classes.
Some of the subclasses from Unearthed Arcana were altered for publication for other Dungeons &amp; Dragonsclasses, such as the soul knife for rogues, the psi warrior for fighter, and the aberrant mind sorcerer. Using psi points for abilities to differentiate from magic, the mystic class uses disciplines that are like warlock invocations to gain very powerful abilities, such as breath weapons that deal 10d6 poison damage, words that frighten and deal psychic damage to up to six creatures, shapeshifting, and even implanting memories into other creature&#39;s minds.
