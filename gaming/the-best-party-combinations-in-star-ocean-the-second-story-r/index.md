## Literature Review

Parties in Star Ocean The Second Story R have strengths and weaknesses. Some fight up close, use many spells, or keep the enemy far away at range.





Many of these team setups are partially about the individual Special Arts or Spells they learn. Many are gained by leveling up. But, others are obtained via side quests or through the complex crafting system. If you are utilizing the latter, then you might also need plenty of extra FOL currency for raw materials.





 Team Synergies 
          

Many teams need a minimum level to learn their key attacks or healing spells. While their normal strikes and use of items can be decent, a character truly shines once they have gained enough Mastery in a Special Art or Spell by spending Battle Points earned after fights. Reserve party members also have a use, making it important to carefully choose who to recruit.

Area Control: Claude, Ernest, Chisato, Rena
 Character  Minimum Level  Key Special Art or Spell   Claude  62  Rock Explosion 300 Mastery, Sword Bomber 420 Mastery   Ernest  58  Sandstorm 300 Mastery, Bed of Roses 200 Mastery   Chisato  76  Tear Gas 100 Mastery, Missile Strike 240 Mastery   Rena  36  Silence, Delay, Fix Cloud, Tractor Beam   






This party focuses on hitting the enemy multiple times in a wide area, with good potential of Breaking their guard and leaving them stunned for a few seconds. Both Ernest and Chisato are met during the second half of the game, so it may take some time to prepare them. But, that gives enough time to fully customize both Claude and Rena.

Heavy Damage: Claude, Ashton, Dias, Noel
 Character  Minimum Level  Key Special Art or Spell   Claude  70  Mirror Blade 460 Mastery, Double Slash 160 Mastery, Dragon Roar 500 Mastery   Ashton  70  Sword Dance 400 Mastery, Vanishing Swords 200 Mastery   Dias  70  Deadly Illusion 420 Mastery, Gale Thrust 130 Mastery   Noel  82  Stone Rain, Fohn Wind, Blood Scylla   



This is a classic team that was favored by many during the game’s original PlayStation release. Claude, Ashton, and Dias are strong and faster swordsmen, who can easily combine their prowess into a powerful melee team. Noel offers both strong offensive spells, but also some healing as a backup. But, if his support is inadequate keep Rena on deck as a Combat Assault for extra healing.




Speed: Welch, Bowman, Chisato, Opera
 Character  Minimum Level  Key Special Art or Spell   Welch  53  Slappity Slap 400 Mastery, Niblungaling 800 Mastery   Bowman  66  Poison Pellets 250 Mastery, Inferno Pellets 100 Mastery   Chisato  76  Flame Thrower 200 Mastery, Tear Gas 100 Mastery   Opera  54  Tracking Plasma 440 Mastery, Hyper Launcher 540 Mastery, Healing Star 999 Mastery   



This party cares more about the amount of hits, rather than how strong each hit is. Lining up their strikes together can create strings of 30, 40, or even 50-hit combos. However, this is very MP intensive. You will either need plenty of items or use the crafting system to assist with MP recovery or cost reduction.

The team is also highly reliant on Opera’s Healing Star to stay healthy. In both cases, having all sorts of support Combat Assaults can be good insurance to prevent death.

                  “A Charming Remake” - Star Ocean: The Second Story R Review   The Second Story R introduces many new mechanics and systems for a faithful reinterpretation of a highly revered PS1 classic.   




Defensive: Claude, Bowman, Opera, Rena
 Character  Minimum Level  Key Special Art or Spell   Claude  20  Sword of Life 200 Mastery   Bowman  28  Self-Medication 999 Mastery   Opera  1 (crafted Special Art)  Healing Star 999 Mastery   Rena  65  Faerie Light, Reflect, Haste, Guard   



Another interesting party is one that completely prioritizes self-healing. Claude, Bowman, and Opera can all learn direct healing Special Arts. Opera heals the whole team, Claude can recover almost 60% of his own life, while Bowman quickly heals without stopping.

Rena is there for even more invincibility by raising all forms of defense and even movement speed. This party is very tough, but might be a bit slower in taking out the enemy. Still, it is a good idea to arm them all with strong weapons like the Aterna Sword.

Ranged: Opera, Precis, Dias, Rena
 Character  Minimum Level  Key Special Art or Spell   Opera  54  Dispersion Ray 540 Mastery, Gravitational Sphere 900 Mastery   Precis  38  Parabola Beam 240 Mastery, Robbie’s Super Beam 120 Mastery,   Dias  1  Air Slash 100 Mastery, Chaos Sword 120 Mastery   Rena  72  Haste, Angel Feather, Star Flare, Gravity Crush   






This is a team that specializes in staying far away and hitting with far-range sniper attacks. Opera always excels at this fighting style, as she is armed with a large bazooka. Precis and Dias have ranged options, but can also fight in melee if the battle gets hairy. Rena is mostly for support but can use spells like Star Flare to add in damage. Both Opera and Precis have to craft to gain all of their Special Arts. Consider using the Pickpocket skill to get an early edge on materials.



Precis cannot gain all her Special Arts without also recruiting Ashton. By picking Opera you will forfeit the Super Holograph attack. But, this is a mid-range attack that doesn’t align with the above-mentioned team.




Mages: Rena, Celine, Leon, Noel
 Character  Minimum Level  Key Special Art or Spell   Rena  63  Star Flare, Reflect, Guard, Tractor Beam, Light Cross   Celine  66  Explode, Thunder Cloud, Southern Cross   Leon  78  Dark Sphere, Demon’s Gate, Noah, Shadow Flare, Deep Freeze   Noel  82  Stone Rain, Curse, Fohn Wind, Neutralize, Mental Drain   






Using all four of the spell casters is both deadly and a bit dangerous. Their spells hit hard and many target the whole field, but can leave the mage open to enemy attacks. You should wait trying out this team until your second or third run of Star Ocean The Second Story R.

That way, you’ll have a much better grip on the entire battle system. If you do want to use a pure wizard team, be sure to assign all of your melee team to Combat Assault actions that can quickly interrupt or stall foes.
