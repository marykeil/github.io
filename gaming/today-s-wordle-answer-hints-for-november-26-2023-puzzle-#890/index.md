The newest word is available to solve and we&#39;ve got hints, and the fully spoiled answer, for the November 26th Wordle answer.





For those that prefer a challenge, there is always the Wordle copycat Quordle. This game challenges players to solve four Wordle puzzles at the exact same time by forcing them to share clues within each answer. This causes the player to be very careful with their guesses as attempts can quickly run out.

The November 26th Wordle answer is SOLID.




For our starting Wordle word we used IRATE, this only provided a single misplaced vowel and a group of incorrect letters. Moving the &#39;I&#39; around we tried CLINK which didn&#39;t lock anything in but did add another misplaced letter with &#39;L&#39;. 

Our third guess was LIMPS, this wasn&#39;t correct but locked in even more incorrect spots and added the &#39;S&#39;. Finally, we scored our Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer SOLID.
