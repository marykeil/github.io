## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has set up plenty of plot points for a future entry in the series, from returning villains to potential new superheroes.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, while telling its own complete narrative, has set up plenty of plot points for a future entry in the acclaimed superhero series. Although a new entry has yet to be officially announced by Sony or Insomniac Games, it seems inevitable after Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s impressive sales, in which the game became the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in its first 24 hours.

Peter Parker and Miles Morales face many new obstacles in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. For example, after the death of his Aunt May, Peter inherits her home in Queens and struggles to pay the mortgage. Miles also battles with his vengeful thoughts once Martin Li - the man who killed his father in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man - escaped custody. The sequel also features the long-awaited arrival of Venom, after the symbiote had been teased in the past two games&#39; post-credits scenes. With so many of these carried over from established plot points in the previous games, it&#39;s safe to say many of the game&#39;s unresolved stories will be continued in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3.

  






 Cletus Kasady Could Become Carnage 
          

One of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s side stories sees former police captain, Yuri Watanabe taking on a sadistic cult known as &#34;The Flame&#34; as her new vigilante alter-ego, Wraith. While some long-term Spider-Man fans may have figured it out while exploring The Flame&#39;s base, the red-headed, heavily scarred cult leader is revealed to be Cletus Kasady, better known to most as the symbiote-enhanced serial killer, Carnage.

Although Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 introduces Kasady in his non-symbiote form, his &#34;prophecy&#34; depicts a ritual that transforms him into a red monster that clearly resembles his more infamous alter-ego as part of an event called &#34;Crimson Dawn.&#34; To achieve this, The Flame acquires one of Oscorp&#39;s symbiote, and Kasady escapes with it by the end of this arc, clearly setting up the arrival of another symbiote threat.




It&#39;s possible that this story could continue into Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3, but considering the popularity of Carnage as a villain, it&#39;s unlikely that Insomniac would relegate his entire arc to side stories, and there are other villains likely to take precedence in the next title. Therefore, the studio could tell a much longer story in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 story DLC similar to the first game&#39;s The City That Never Sleeps than it could in side missions. However, as of the time of writing, the only confirmed post-game content for the game consists of a New Game Plus and Mission Select feature and extra suit collaborations with artists.



The City That Never Sleeps took approximately 12 hours to fully complete.






 Cindy Moon&#39;s Arrival Teased Another Spider-Person 
          




Earlier in the game&#39;s story, Rio tells Miles that she has been dating for the first time since the death of his father Jefferson Davis, and has met someone she would like to introduce to him. After many failed attempts to have dinner together due to Miles needing to spring into action as Spider-Man, they finally meet in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s post-credits scene. Although he is only referred to as &#34;Albert&#34; in the dialogue, the subtitles reveal his full name is Albert Moon.

Albert also brings his daughter, Cindy to meet the Morales family, and while this seems fairly pedestrian on the surface, Cindy Moon is better known to comic fans as Silk, a fellow spider-person. In the comics, Cindy got her powers from the same spider that bit Peter Parker. However, Insomniac&#39;s version seems to be closer to Miles&#39; age. Therefore, it is possible that this origin could be reworked slightly in future entries to have her bitten by a different spider, although players did see Miles killing the spider that bit him in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man before it bit anyone else.




With Peter taking a hiatus from his superhero duties by the end of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, and Miles taking on the responsibility of looking after the city solo, it&#39;s possible that Insomniac could be setting Silk up to be yet another playable hero in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3. With Miles and Cindy sharing a family dynamic as well as fighting crime together, and being closer in age, this could lend itself to a different kind of relationship between the heroes, rather than Miles trying to be a mentor in the same way Peter was to him.

                  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2: Who Is [SPOILER] In The Post-Credits Scene?   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 features a mysterious character in its post-credits scene. Here’s who she is, and how she might factor into the series’ future.    



 Norman Osborn Will Probably Become Green Goblin 
          




At the end of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Harry Osborn bonds completely with the symbiote to become Venom, and Dr. Curt Connors informs Spider-Man that the only way to defeat the symbiote is to kill its host. In a moment of clarity, Harry gives Peter his blessing to do so, but his death is short-lived as Miles resuscitates him with his bioelectric powers soon after the symbiotes&#39; defeat, but the damage is done and Harry is rendered brain-dead.

Later, Norman sits distraught at a comatose Harry&#39;s bedside and tells one of his scientists to prepare something called &#34;G-Serum.&#34; Although the implication is that this could be another way to treat Harry, it&#39;s possible that Norman could use it on himself to exact his revenge against the Spider-Men for &#34;ruining&#34; his son, transforming himself into Green Goblin. There have been other nods to Norman&#39;s villainous alter-ego in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. Osborn&#39;s penthouse featured a high-tech, armored combat mask resembling the villain&#39;s grinning face and small explosive devices that resembled his pumpkin bombs. The character&#39;s glider technology could also be seen as a &#34;medical evacuation drone&#34; during an Oscorp tech expo.




The Green Goblin is one of Spider-Man&#39;s most iconic villains in the comics, attacking Peter Parker&#39;s loved ones, and being responsible for the death of Gwen Stacy. Norman seems determined to find out the identities of the Spider-Men in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s post-credits scene, and if he succeeds in this goal, none of the series&#39; supporting cast will be safe in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3.

                  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2: Every Villain Confirmed &amp; Teased So Far   Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 will see Peter and Miles taking on a variety of different villains over the course of the game&#39;s campaign.    



 Doc Ock Has A Menacing Plan 
          

To learn the identity of the Spider-Men, Norman turns to his former colleague turned rival, and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s primary antagonist, Otto Octavius, who is still contained within the R.A.F.T. supermax prison. Otto, however, doesn&#39;t disclose this information to Norman, instead telling him &#34;We all have to experience loss. Even you, Norman.&#34; Although Otto won&#39;t assist Norman with his plans for revenge, he clearly has his own ideas regarding what to do with the Spider-Men.




Throughout the scene, Otto is writing in a book with a shaking hand, showing further deterioration of his body since the first game. When Norman inquires about it, he states that he&#39;s writing &#34;the final chapter.&#34; This could be Insomniac Games hinting that Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 3 could be the final game in the series with another personal showdown between the heroes and some of their classic villains. Alternatively, it could indicate that Otto is preparing a kind of Superior Spider-Man-esque plan as a solution to his degenerative neurological disease.



The Superior Spider-Man comics saw a dying Otto Octavius place his consciousness in Peter Parker&#39;s body and take over the role of Spider-Man.




With Miles set up as the predominant Spider-Man for a while in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s ending, and potentially teaming up with Silk in the future, it&#39;s possible that Insomniac Games may even make the daring decision to have Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus kill Peter Parker, making it the original Spider-Man&#39;s &#34;final chapter&#34;. This would hark back to Miles Morales&#39; original origin story in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics in which he died at the hands of the Green Goblin, but would still make for a shocking twist considering the duo&#39;s dynamic in the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games so far.
