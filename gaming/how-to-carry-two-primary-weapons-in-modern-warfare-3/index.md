## Literature Review

In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 you need to equip either the Gunner Vest or Overkill Vest to carry two of the primary weapons at one time.





Traditionally, in Call of Duty games, you carry one primary weapon, such as one of the best Assault Rifles available, and a secondary weapon, such as a handgun or a melee weapon. However, carrying two primary weapons opens up new possibilities in matches, such as carrying an SMG for close combat alongside a Sniper Rifle for long-range. This can be particularly useful on certain maps with elements of both gameplay styles.

To be able to carry two Primary Weapons In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, you need to equip either the Gunner Vest or Overkill Vest.




You need to reach Level 20 to unlock The Gunner Vest, with the Overkill Vest unlocked at Level 50. This can be done by using the fastest methods to earn XP in MW3 and leveling up in the game. To be able to carry two primary weapons, both vests do exactly the same, so from level 20, you will be able to do this via The Gunner Vest. It also gives you further benefits of an improved reloading speed and max ammo, while the Overkill Vest increases the speed at which you can switch weapons.




Once you have unlocked either of the vests, you must go to Weapons in your custom loadouts and select whichever vest you want to use. From here, you will have two primary weapons slots, which you can fill with the guns of your choice. Having two primary weapons available at your disposal can be game-changing in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and you can do this by equipping the correct items.
