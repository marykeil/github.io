  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Many early 2000s online games have since disappeared, but the Flashpoint archive preserves over 150,000 Flash games.
Social games like Gaia Online and Poptropica were popular free online games of the 2000s.
Hosting sites like Addicting Games and Miniclip were also popular platforms for online gaming.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>These websites are sure to bring back the 2000s nostalgia and the online gamer in everyone.</p>
<p>Forget butterfly clips, trucker caps, and flip phones: nothing screams the early 2000s like a Neopets or RuneScape-style online PC game. Growing up in the 2000s, the free-to-play landscape was immensely different. Hundreds of thousands of Flash games were available for free online, from the fan-made to the corporate promotional. Mostly short and sweet, these games could run even on a lower-end PC. Microtransactions were nearly unheard of, and many made games for the simple joy of creation (and a healthy dose of ad revenue). They weren&rsquo;t always good, but they were usually free.
Unfortunately, the browser game landscape changed drastically when Adobe stopped supporting Flash Player in 2020. This was the platform many online games were built on, and without it, many of these sites will never again see the light of day. Browser games can still run on Java, and many still exist, but the popularity of free online browser games has undeniably dwindled. Luckily, over 150,000 Flash games have been preserved by the Flashpoint archive. While some of these games have fallen by the wayside, a few are still available for nostalgic revisiting today.</p>
<p>If You Were A Neopets Kid, It&rsquo;s Time To Start Playing Again<br>
Neopets just gave its long-lost players an incredible reason to come back to the game in 2024. Here’s what it is, and when it becomes available.</p>
<p>Postopia Hosted Delightfully Delicious Mini-Games
Bedrock Bobsleddin&rsquo; Blowout, Oreo O&rsquo;s Creme Team Journey, &amp; More</p>
<p>In a smart and creative marketing tactic, the Post/Kraft food conglomerate (the same one behind everyone&rsquo;s favorite sugary cereals and mac and cheese) launched a website in 2001 that had games featuring (and heavily promoting) the brand&rsquo;s products like Fruity/Cocoa Pebbles, Honeycomb, and Golden Crisp, among others. Games included Bedrock Bobsleddin&rsquo; Blowout for Pebbles cereal and Oreo O&rsquo;s Creme Team Journey themed for Oreo O&rsquo;s. Starting in 2003, cereal boxes included codes called Postokens that could be used to unlock exclusive games, cheats, and extra levels.
Unfortunately, Postopia shut down in 2011. It was replaced by the Flintstones-themed Pebbles Play, which has also since gone offline. Thankfully, many original Postopia games are preserved and playable via Flashpoint, including Asteroid Avalanche, Be a Popstar, and Berry Pebbles Bumper Pool. Those Postokens probably don&rsquo;t work anymore, though.</p>
<p>Barbie.com Used To Have A Plethora Of Free Games
Barbie&rsquo;s Zoom And Groom, Let&rsquo;s Babysit Krissy, Superstar Makeover, &amp; More</p>
<p>For the Barbie Girl of the 2000s, Barbie.com was the place to go for online games. On this pink-painted website, users could play a variety of games centered around Barbie, her friends, and her hobbies: makeovers, horse grooming, babysitting, et cetera.
Barbie.com is still up and running today, but it&rsquo;s mostly been converted to an online shop. But the Barbie brand has had an incredible revival in recent years, mostly due to the Barbie movie, which may cause fond memories of these free-to-play games. For anyone who wants to relive their Y2K Barbie nostalgia, Una Dabiero at Babe.net has compiled some of the games that were available to play on Barbie.com, a few of which are still playable in the post-Flash era.</p>
<p>Gaia Online Was A Stylish Social Game
Still Available Today</p>
<p>An online game with an anime-inspired aesthetic, Gaia Online has gone through many changes in its time. Most 2000s gamers will recognize Gaia Online as a social gaming site that had a messaging forum. Players could style their avatars, visit virtual rooms, and chat with others. At its peak, the site was incredibly popular with over 7 million monthly users in 2008, as reported by Virtual World News.</p>
<p>10 Forgotten Gadgets Of The 2000s That Kids Won&rsquo;t Recognize Today<br>
From ​​​​​​​T-Mobile Sidekicks to Furbys, there are oodles of gadgets from the 2000s that kids today would scratch their heads at.</p>
<p>Gaia Online still exists today, but it&rsquo;s markedly different. Having undergone an expansive graphical overhaul, lost many of its mini-games with the death of Flash, and seen a sharp drop in its player base, Gaia Online is a husk of its former self. Still, it&rsquo;s one of the few free-to-play social games that&rsquo;s still around today, so it&rsquo;s good for a little bit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Stardoll Is The Ultimate Dress-Up Game
Still Available Today</p>
<p>One of the world&rsquo;s largest online fashion communities, Stardoll was the site to go to for dress-up games. Stardoll lets users design custom avatars, and style themselves according to the latest trends. But back in its heyday, the most popular dolls were the celebrities du jour. This website, along with many others like it, no doubt inspired thousands of kids on the World Wide Web to pursue careers in fashion when they grew up.</p>
<p>Poptropica Is An Educational RPG For Kids
Now Fully Free-To-Play</p>
<p>Targeted at kids from ages six to 15, Poptropica is an educational online role-playing game launched in 2007. Players customize avatars, adopt pets, explore virtual islands, and play a wide variety of mini-games. Many of the games on Poptropica are simple - things like sudoku or dots and boxes. However, Poptropica made learning fun through game quest scenarios called &ldquo;Islands,&rdquo; in which players would have to demonstrate their problem-solving skills to successfully navigate.
Fun fact: The creator of Poptropica is also the creator behind the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and movies.</p>
<p>Poptropica is still available in 2024, although it&rsquo;s now hosted by another site that may be familiar to Flash gamers: Cool Math Games. It&rsquo;s also available on macOS PC, iOS, and Android devices. Besides the $20 fee paid for its Steam version, Poptropica is now absolutely free. There are no membership requirements for any of its content, so the game is more open than ever.</p>
<p>Miniclip Was A Flash Game Paradise
8 Ball Pool, Agar.io, Dune Buggy, &amp; More</p>
<p>With numerous flash games to choose from, it was easy to spend hours on Miniclip. Some popular choices were the GTA-inspired On the Run, the side-scrolling platformer Dune Buggy, and the tactical artillery game Raft Wars. At the time, Miniclip was a website that ensured legitimate and safe games that were easily accessible without much browsing. It played host to a wealth of fun, bite-sized games, and it always seemed to have something new on its front page.
Miniclip has since pivoted to mobile game development, where it&rsquo;s been just as successful with 8 Ball Pool and Agar.io. While there are few browser games available on Miniclip&rsquo;s website today, many of the Flash classics it hosted are archived by Flashpoint. Since mobile gaming became the gaming mode of choice, the removal of browser games on Miniclip was bound to happen.</p>
<p>Addicting Games Lived Up To Its Name
With Links To Thousands Of Flash Games</p>
<p>With a wide array of games to choose from, it&rsquo;s no wonder why this website is called Addicting Games. Addicting Games was effectively a database of all the greatest Flash games on the internet. It included several categories to choose from, including action, comedy, and strategy games. The website also offered some multiplayer options, allowing friends to play together.
A great resource for free online games, Addicting Games had a massive hold on the slew of online gamers that was prevalent in the new millennium. While it&rsquo;s still up and running today, it exists in a very different state. It&rsquo;s mostly devoted to mobile game clones, things with titles like Big Farm or Daily Quindle, many of which rely on microtransactions.</p>
<p>Runescape Is The Ultimate Free Fantasy MMO
Still Available In Old School And Redesigned Versions</p>
<p>Runescape</p>
<p>Publisher  Jagex   Genre  Fantasy   Mode  MMORPG   Platform  PC</p>
<p>Any kid whose parents refused to buy a World of Warcraft subscription inevitably ended up on RuneScape. Released in 2001, RuneScape is a free, fantasy role-playing massively multiplayer online game. RuneScape is set in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm where users can cast magical spells, encounter monsters, and go on mythical quests with customizable avatars. RuneScape is still going strong, and there was even a Runescape comic run in 2023. The original version is still playable as Old School RuneScape, a slightly modified version of the game as it was in 2007.
However, players spend most of their time in Gielinor chopping down trees, burning shrimp, or fletching arrows. RuneScape might just be the grindiest game out there: there are fifteen skills to level up, and it can easily take thousands of hours to bring them all up to the maximum. However, with a living, breathing economy and a bustling social scene, RuneScape is far from boring.</p>
<p>Habbo Hotel Is The Ultimate Virtual Chat Room
Still Available Today</p>
<p>Habbo Hotel was established in Finland in 2000, but soon expanded to over 150 countries, engaging teens and young adults all over the globe. On Habbo, players create their own avatar, using them to perform a variety of activities. Players can design their own private rooms or public hangout spaces, take care of virtual pets, chat with others, and create or play user-made mini-games.
While Habbo Hotel may have enjoyed its peak in the 2000s, the site is still active. Its 20th anniversary coincided with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing thousands of players flooding back to the site as a substitute for face-to-face interaction. Habbo enjoyed more than 800,000 monthly active users in January 2021, according to Pocket Gamer.</p>
<p>Newgrounds Was The Ultimate Source Of All Things Flash
Stick RPG, Dad &rsquo;n&rsquo; Me, Alien Hominid, &amp; More</p>
<p>Offering a wealth of cool flash games such Stick RPG, Dad &rsquo;n&rsquo; Me and Alien Hominid, along with animations and music, Newgrounds was an entertainment paradise. Often regarded as playing an important part in the internet culture of the 2000s and even 2010s, Newgrounds is a place where animators, musicians, and indie game developers were able to showcase their work and gain a following. Newgrounds is still up and running today, and has gotten a bit of a boost since the popularity of the rhythm game Friday Night Funkin&rsquo;.
Unlike many of the other sites on this list, Newgrounds hasn&rsquo;t changed all that much from its original incarnation. There&rsquo;s less gratuitous stick figure violence on the front page, but the concept is the same: creators submit their work to the site, where fans can enjoy and interact with it for free. Many classic Newgrounds games have been adapted into full releases, like in the case of Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers. Other popular Newgrounds creators have moved onto bigger and better projects, like Smiling Friends or Cult of the Lamb, but still take inspiration from the classic Newgrounds style.
While the internet is undoubtedly different from what it was two decades ago, the spirit of classic 2000s online games is alive and well. Many of these classic games are still around, and for every one that isn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a new work that takes inspiration from it. Flashpoint and others have done excellent work in attempting to preserve unique games from the 2000s. Whether it&rsquo;s their first time or their thousandth time playing a Flash game, there&rsquo;s something for everyone in this fondly remembered era.
