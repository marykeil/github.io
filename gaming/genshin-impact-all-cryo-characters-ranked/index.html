  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Cryo characters in Genshin Impact excel at freezing opponents and triggering reactions like Melt.
While some Cryo characters like Kaeya and Chongyun are strong choices, others like Aloy and Mika are best ignored for optimized play.
Cryo characters come in a large variety when it comes to roles, being able to deal damage, heal, and provide support for the team.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Genshin Impact includes multiple characters split between six different elements. Here is how the Cryo characters stack up to one another.</p>
<p>Cryo characters in Genshin Impact are capable of manipulating ice powers, with Cryo being one of the six available elements in the game. There are several playable characters built around the element. Represented by a snowflake symbol, Cryo characters are oriented toward ice-based attacks and skills, and excel at freezing opponents and triggering reactions like Melt, for instance. Some Cryo users are available from the main storyline, such as Kaeya, while others require a bit more luck with the pull rates in Genshin Impact. Nevertheless, there are many great options to choose from.
Although there are Cryo users for every role ranging from DPS to support and healer, not everyone can utilize the element efficiently. Some Cryo characters are best ignored for optimized play, while others rank among the strongest choices in the game. From Kaeya, the oldest character in the game that can be acquired easily through the campaign, to a few new Genshin Impact characters from Fontaine, like Wriothesley and Charlotte, Cryo options are nothing if not versatile.
: All Boss Locations In Genshin Impact</p>
<p>15  Aloy
Main DPS</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn&rsquo;s Aloy made history as a crossover character in Genshin Impact, a first for the game that has not yet been replicated. Unfortunately, her gameplay features fail to deliver a comparable impact. Her kit complements her bow and arrow with some explosive Cryo features based on Horizon Zero Dawn items but fails to stand out from the pack or deliver any unique competitive edge.
Unlike other Genshin Impact Cryo characters, the lack of constellations for Aloy also leaves her without an interesting upgrade path to help solve this issue. Outside of being a Horizon Zero Dawn fan, there is not enough of a reason to pick Aloy as an effective Cryo character to use in the game.</p>
<p>14  Chongyun
Sub-DPS</p>
<p>In the past, Chongyun made an interesting sub-DPS Cryo character primarily due to his Elemental Skill. With the proper Chongyun build in Genshin Impact, players can set up some great continuous Elemental Reactions. By shattering ice on the ground, Chongyun places a field that infuses all upcoming attacks by him or his allies with the Cryo element. This can start great permafreeze combos, especially with Xingqiu, who can infuse the character&rsquo;s attacks with Hydro.
With the right party and planning, Chongyun can still be a great sub-DPS option in Genshin Impact. However, his Cryo infusion interacts with all attacks in its area, and this can cause problems with certain compositions or attack strategies. With a claymore for his physical weapon, Chongyun&rsquo;s slow attacks don&rsquo;t provide a strong enough alternative when his infusions are not helping.</p>
<p>13  Kaeya
Main DPS &amp; Sub-DPS</p>
<p>Kaeya is the only Cryo character that is a guaranteed reward through Genshin Impact&rsquo;s main story. Both his skills have short cooldowns while his Elemental Burst persists if the player swaps characters. This makes Kaeya a great option early on since pairing him with a Hydro character can easily trigger Freeze reactions within a permafreeze team comp. In addition, his passive Talent reduces the party&rsquo;s Stamina consumption by 20%, which is extremely useful for exploration.
However, as the player unlocks other characters, Kaeya becomes less useful. His Elemental Skill doesn&rsquo;t last long and his damage is not as high when compared to others. Constellations that are hard to unlock compound this problem, meaning that many players will find themselves using Kaeya less and less over time.</p>
<p>12  Mika
Support</p>
<p>A Cryo character in Genshin Impact, Mika&rsquo;s main issue comes in terms of how niche he is. His unique kit has advantages, such as increasing the party&rsquo;s Attack Speed, healing the party, and offering a Physical Damage bonus to teammates. Unfortunately, making full use of these benefits requires a party focused on Physical Damage and combat against multiple enemies rather than Cryo Damage itself.
Mika&rsquo;s Constellations can help make the character more relevant, but without them, there aren&rsquo;t enough situations that justify his use over another character. It is possible that changes over time will bring him more into play in the meta. At the moment, however, most team compositions won&rsquo;t have as much use for Mika as they do for other Cryo characters.</p>
<p>11  Qiqi
Support</p>
<p>Qiqi is a great support character overall as her skills are focused on healing based on the damage dealt. It is recommended for players to use Qiqi&rsquo;s abilities and then swap characters since the skills persist with her being off-field. Especially if combined with another character&rsquo;s Elemental Burst that deals high damage, an optimized Qiqi character build in Genshin Impact can result in a surprisingly high amount of healing.
Nevertheless, Qiqi&rsquo;s main issue is her extremely long skill cooldowns. Due to that, her healing powers will be helpful only occasionally, and that can be a problem when facing strong opponents or a large pack of enemies. With a lack of general versatility beyond healing, there are better options in Genshin Impact for keeping a party&rsquo;s health up, even if they lie in other elements.</p>
<p>10  Freminet
Main DPS</p>
<p>Although Freminet is a Cryo character, he excels when operating as a mix between a Cryo DPS and a Physical DPS. In a sense, the Fontainian character is like a 4-star version of Eula, but less effective. Nevertheless, if players are lacking the presence of the 5-star hero on their team, they may as well use Freminet in Genshin Impact.
The character is quite versatile and, even if his build can get tricky when balancing Cryo and Physical Damage, he makes up for it with pure damage output. Another good thing about Freminet is that having him on the player’s team while venturing underwater can make exploration much easier, as he reduces the consumption of Stamina when underwater.</p>
<p>9  Rosaria
Main DPS, Sub-DPS, &amp; Support</p>
<p>Rosaria is the most versatile of all Genshin Impact Cryo characters, able to serve as DPS, sub-DPS, or support. As a DPS, she focuses on increasing her Critical Rate through abilities, weapons, and Artifacts that let Rosaria deal high damage. As a sub-DPS, Rosaria can use her Elemental Burst to set up Cryo spread for the team to trigger Elemental Reactions. As a support, Rosaria can increase allies&rsquo; Movement Speed at night, and, after unlocking her second Constellation level, she can buff allies with Critical Rate.
However, Rosaria&rsquo;s Elemental Skill doesn&rsquo;t work properly versus larger enemies as she is unable to teleport behind them – which is terrible since quick repositioning is one of the main benefits of her gameplay kit. In addition to that, although she works relatively well in every role, other characters simply tend to be better at their respective strengths. This is quite common for characters that are too versatile: they end up not being the best at a specific job because they are fairly good in all jobs.</p>
<p>8  Charlotte
Sub-DPS &amp; Support</p>
<p>Following the trend set by Wriothesley, Charlotte is also one of the first Cryo characters to employ a catalyst, allowing them to deal Cryo Damage with Normal and Charged Attacks. Charlotte can operate as either a sub-DPS or a support character in a team comp in Genshin Impact. Because of how she is built, she is very good at setting up Elemental Reactions that involve Cryo by easily spreading the element on enemies.
Charlotte can also be used as a healer for the party. Though she is significantly less effective than other healers, like Bennett or Kokomi, the fact that she can do so while applying Cryo can be a game changer depending on the player’s team comp. To work at her best, Charlotte really needs her Constellations unlocked, but that is easier done as she is a 4-star hero.</p>
<p>7  Diona
Support</p>
<p>The Cryo support character Diona can both heal and protect, making her useful for fragile teams. Her Elemental Skill throws projectiles and creates a shield for her. If the player can level her up to Constellation level two, the shield can also affect Diona&rsquo;s allies in coop mode in Genshin Impact.
The main asset in a well-built Diona combo is her Elemental Burst, which creates a large AoE (area of effect) field that deals Cryo Damage to all enemies while also healing all allies. Since she can set up Elemental Reactions easily, heal allies, and even create shields, she is considered one of the best support characters overall. Diona&rsquo;s main issues are her low defense and HP, meaning that players have to be extra careful when building her to compensate for her base stats.</p>
<p>6  Layla
Support</p>
<p>Genshin Impact&rsquo;s Layla works well as a defensive support character, providing protection with an elemental shield ability. Unlike Diona, however, Layla lacks healing abilities, focusing instead on balancing protection and damage. Layla&rsquo;s shield works as the core of her techniques, feeding into her ability to deal Cryo damage to enemies.
As a 4-star character, Layla&rsquo;s Constellations are also reasonably attainable, letting players competitively upgrade her without too much pain. Layla excels at her job by having a very low Energy cost and short cooldowns, which allow both her Burst and her Skill to be used constantly.</p>
<p>5  Shenhe
Support</p>
<p>Added in the Genshin Impact Version 2.3 update, Shenhe is a 5-star Cryo polearm character. Her Elemental Skill and Burst both make her combo well with other Cryo characters, boosting damage by bestowing the Icy Quill effect and lowering enemies&rsquo; Cryo and Physical Resistance with an AoE ability. With the right characters at her side, particularly the stronger Cryo DPS characters, Shenhe can be a huge boon.
Playing her alongside characters that will benefit less from her support, however, will not yield comparable results. Shenhe is, in her essence, a support character made to debuff opponents for her Cryo team to take advantage of. This limits her potential but in a good way. She does have a high Energy cost for her Burst, but it does pay off – and with the proper battery, she can have the field AoE field up quite often.</p>
<p>4  Eula
Main DPS</p>
<p>Eula is one of the strongest Cryo characters in Genshin Impact primarily due to being the only claymore user with rapid attacks. Her Elemental Skill increases her damage and her resistance to interruptions, thus allowing her to keep on attacking without fearing that she might get knocked down. Eula&rsquo;s Elemental Burst deals high AoE damage, increases her Physical Damage for a few seconds, and creates a sword that explodes after a while for even more damage, resulting in strong DPS at any Eula level.
Although her Elemental Skill has a high cooldown and the Elemental Burst is expensive in terms of Energy needed, the damage definitely makes up for that. However, it is important to know that, despite being a Cryo character, Eula is at her best when being utilized as a Physical DPS. As such, she will require buffs from characters like Shenhe to be able to deal even more damage, as Elemental Reactions are not her strong suit.</p>
<p>3  Ayaka
Main DPS</p>
<p>Ayaka&rsquo;s addition to Genshin Impact quickly put her in a solid spot in the meta as a top-tier Cryo DPS character, a position that has remained unchanged since. Similar to Mona, she has a special dash that is helpful in both combat and exploration as it provides high mobility. The main difference is that immediately after Ayaka&rsquo;s dash, all her Normal and Charged Attacks become infused with Cryo, facilitating the application of the element onto enemies for future Reactions.
Ayaka&rsquo;s Elemental Skill, with the proper Talent leveling, can deal a great deal of Cryo Damage. In addition, her Elemental Burst is a large and moving AoE that is especially strong for destroying tougher enemies. With the proper builds, Ayaka can deal exceptionally high damage. While she can operate on her own very well, Ayaka becomes unstoppable when paired up with the proper party members, be they off-field Sub-DPS heroes or support characters that interact with her Cryo application.</p>
<p>2  Wriothesley
Main DPS</p>
<p>As a Cryo character, Wriothesley is a fantastic asset for several types of team comps. As one of the first Cryo characters to use a catalyst in Genshin Impact, he can diffuse Cryo by using his Normal and Charged Attacks. These abilities are, conveniently, the main source of his damage. When using an off-field support or sub-DPS capable of spreading Hydro or Pyro, Wriothesley can easily and consistently trigger Elemental Reactions while dealing his regular damage.
Although it can be perceived as a downside, Wriothesley actually has an HP-loss mechanic when fighting. This will put him at risk, but players can combine a large HP pool for maximized damage, and then use Artifacts that benefit characters who suffer fluctuations in the HP. Even with his risky gameplay mechanic, Wriothesley is one of the best Cryo characters in the game so far.</p>
<p>1  Ganyu
Main DPS</p>
<p>Ganyu is the strongest Genshin Impact Cryo user due to her crowd control Elemental Skill and her large AoE Elemental Burst. She offers high damage and can easily trigger some of the best Elemental Reaction in Genshin Impact. Her Elemental Skill places a flower that takes the aggro from all enemies and explodes after a few seconds, dealing Cryo Damage.
In addition, Ganyu is a bow user and can charge her shots to inflict more AoE Cryo damage easily. As a character who deals high AoE damage with her Charged Attacks and both active Talents, she is one of the most-used DPS characters in Genshin Impact.
