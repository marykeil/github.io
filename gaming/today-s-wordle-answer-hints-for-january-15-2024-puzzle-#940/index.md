## Literature Review

A fresh new Wordle word is ready to be solved. Despite our loss today, we&#39;ve still got hints and the full answer for today&#39;s Wordle.





The January 15th Wordle word wasn&#39;t particularly hard, and it&#39;s a very common word, the issue arose with the multiple options that were available once we discovered a good chunk of the letters. This can easily get a player locked into a loop of guesses that just don&#39;t come to fruition before the sixth attempt. 




                  Wordle 4 Times At Once With Quordle Is An Even Harder Challenge   New game Quordle ups the challenge of the internet sensation Wordle by forcing players to solve four different puzzles at the same time.

The January 15th Wordle answer is LUNCH.

Despite our loss, we ended up getting most of the word quite quickly. For our starting Wordle word we used IRATE. This provided no help as none of the letters were in the correct answer. Luckily, when this happens we have our quick-transition word POUND which we used today as our second guess. This gave us a couple of incorrect letters and a decent start into our third guess.

For our third attempt, we tried CUMIN, which locked in the &#39;U&#39; and proved a new incorrect location for the &#39;N&#39; and a misplaced &#39;C&#39;. Moving forward PUNCH was our fourth attempt and this led us down the quick path to a loss. Guess number five was HUNCH, and finally we ran out of Wordle guesses by trying BUNCH.

Any loss in the game will provide the correct answer, and we were certainly on our way to scoring it but sometimes that&#39;s just how things fall. Time to start a new win streak tomorrow!
