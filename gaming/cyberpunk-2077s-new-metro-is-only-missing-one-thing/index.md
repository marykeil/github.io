# Cyberpunk 2077s New Metro Is Only Missing One Thing


## SUMMARY 



  The inclusion of a metro system in Cyberpunk 2077 adds believability and immersion to Night City&#39;s transportation options.   The metro system in the game will have 19 stations, making it easily accessible from anywhere in the city and offering new NPC interactions and city views.   The absence of pickpocketing in Cyberpunk 2077 is a strange exclusion, considering it is a common feature in open-world games and could add an interesting criminal element to the metro experience.

## Literature Review

The inclusion of a proper metro system is a big step up for Cyberpunk 2077, but one new feature could have been the perfect cherry on top.




Cyberpunk 2077 is finally making it possible to use the metro system, and there&#39;s only one little addition that could make the feature everything that it should be. The metro has been a long-requested feature for Cyberpunk 2077, with a heavy focus on it in promotional material, making it seem like an obvious candidate for actual inclusion in the game. Although there are plenty of ways to get around quickly, the inclusion of a usable metro helps up the believability and immersion of Night City while offering a more hands-off method of standard travel.




The metro system is receiving 19 stations in total in Cyberpunk 2077, so it should be relatively easy to access from just about any corner of the city. This expands on a previous functionality built around fast travel, but actually getting on the trains provides new NPC interactions and views of the city. These changes and many more will arrive in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 patch, which is a surprising new addition to a game that was supposed to wrap up with Phantom Liberty, which is set to arrive on December 5 alongside the Ultimate Edition of the game.

                  Cyberpunk 2077 Releases New Content, But It&#39;s Not An Update   There&#39;s a new way to experience more of the Cyberpunk 2077 world of Night City, but it&#39;s not in the form of content added to the game itself.   


 Pickpocketing Would Perfect The Cyberpunk 2077 Metro 
          




The corrupt world of Cyberpunk 2077 has plenty of criminal opportunities, but one that the game has never made use of is pickpocketing. Adding pickpocketing would be a great way to give the metro more life, as it would provide an interesting opportunity for theft that could result in some memorable interactions. The anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners showed characters Lucy and David pickpocketing on the metro, so it would also be an excellent tie-in to the series that introduced many fans to the world of Night City for the first time.

 Cyberpunk 2077 Not Having Pickpocketing Is Weird 
          




Of all the features to never make it into Cyberpunk 2077, pickpocketing has to be one of the strangest exclusions overall. It&#39;s not a particularly uncommon feature in open-world games, making appearances in major titles like the Assassin&#39;s Creed series and RPGs from Bethesda Game Studios. Although it might seem minor compared to major heists, it seems unlikely that a Streetkid in Cyberpunk 2077 with the potential to make it big would never have learned the trick. The recently improved reactivity of law enforcement and the new Wanted system provide a better framework for the inclusion of pickpocketing than ever before.

The introduction of a proper metro system in Cyberpunk 2077 is exciting with or without pickpocketing, but Patch 2.1 is nonetheless the proper time to mourn the lack of a potentially exciting feature. It&#39;s not impossible that developer CD Projekt Red could ever toss more into the mix, as the studio just recently promised an update for The Witcher 3, a much older game, in addition to the surprise of the Cyberpunk 2077 2.1 patch itself. Nonetheless, it seems like it&#39;s best to assume that pickpocketing on the metro will never be officially supported in Cyberpunk 2077, and it&#39;s hard not to see it as an unfortunate oversight.
