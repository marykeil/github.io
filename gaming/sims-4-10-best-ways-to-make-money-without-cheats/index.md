## Literature Review

There are plenty of ways to make money in Sims 4, but for those wanting to avoid cheats, it will require a little more work to make Simoleons.





To avoid using cheats in Sims 4, Simmers will have to resort to more traditional ways of making money. Some of these may seem very familiar, such as getting a job or making money off a hobby, while others are less obvious such as stealing, beachcombing, and digging for treasure. Regardless of whatever appeals to players more, all are great options for extra pocket money.
Any of the methods that involve a skill will make more if that associated skill is higher. Performing, painting, and others like that will make the most possible money when the skill associated with it is maxed out. 

            
 
 10 Reasons You&#39;ll Never Quit The Sims 4 (Despite Its Flaws) 
The Sims 4 has more than its share of problems, but even with Sims 5 and Life by You on the horizon, it looks like it’s here to stay. Here’s why.












 








 10  Musical Performances 
Singing Or Playing An Instrument In Public


One of the ways to earn extra Simoleons is to have a talented Sim perform for others. This can be done using any musical instrument, including a piano, guitar, violin, and even just singing with a microphone. The main catch is that Sims need to do this in a public place where other Sims can listen to them, allowing them to receive tips. 
Sims can level up their Singing skill fast by Singing in the Shower, making this a quick way to make money with no base cost. 

This can be done anywhere, including in a front yard, but ideally, players will want to focus on public lots with at least five or six other Sims around. A good place to perform is in San Myshuno&#39;s Waterside Warble, where a busking setup can be found near the food stalls. The tip amount won&#39;t be huge, but it&#39;s still an easy way to earn while increasing a skill.





 9  Beachcombing Can Be Lucrative 
Find Treasures To Sell
        

Beachcombing is an easy way to make some money. To do it, Sims don&#39;t even necessarily need a beach, despite the name. They can perform this task anywhere that has sand floor texture. Simply click on the ground where the sand is, and Sims should be prompted with two options: looking for seashells or trash. Look for seashells, and the Sim should begin digging in the sand. This also won&#39;t provide vast amounts of money, but doing it for a minute or two and selling the findings can reward a decent amount, making it a fast way to make Simoleons in Sims 4. 
Watch out as Beachcombing can sometimes give negative Moodlets to your Sims if they&#39;re bitten by a crab. 






 8  Dig For Collectibles 
Money Underground
        

Similar to beachcombing, digging for collectibles in Sims 4 involves the Sim digging through the dirt and various terrain to find different little objects which can be sold. To do this, Sims will have to find specific rocks or dirt mounds that prompt it. They can be found scattered anywhere, but the park in Oasis Springs is one place to find a good amount of them. However, one thing to note about this option is that Sims will find capsules with a set value. They can be sold as is or opened, but be warned that opening them could increase or decrease their importance.





 7  Borrow Money From Friends 
A Useful Skill
        

One way to acquire a decent amount of money is simply asking for it, however, this method requires little work. Sims have the ability to ask those they have friendships with in Sims 4 for a loan, but they do have to jump through a couple of hoops first. To ask for money, Sims need to be at a Charisma level of 7, but this will only allow them to ask for a small loan.
To ask for a large one, Charisma will need to be maxed out. Sims will also only be able to ask for loans from those they are friends with. Though this requires some work, it can be worth it as the larger loans are a few thousand dollars. The best part of borrowing money is that you won&#39;t need to pay it back.





 6  Steal To Make Money In Sims 4 
Life A Life Of Crime


Though it isn&#39;t the most ethical, stealing can provide a good amount of Simoleons. To properly steal items, Sims need to have the kleptomaniac trait and level up their Mischief. Additionally, to steal something, especially at lower levels, it&#39;s best not to have anyone around; otherwise, the Sim will be caught and embarrassed. When still working on building up the skill, Sims will only be able to steal smaller objects but max out this trait to be able to grab the large high-selling items, like an entire piano.





 5  Make Money Online With The Computer 
Writing &amp; Winning Tournaments
        

Another excellent and easy option for some income is utilizing a computer. Sims can earn money through writing and other various activities when using a computer, but writing a book is the most recommended option. After the Sim completes the book, they can publish it by putting it in the mailbox. Once this is done, they can make daily royalties on their work. The amounts will vary, but it is an excellent option for passive income. The higher the Sim&#39;s skill, the better the book they will write and the more money they will make.
Another good option for Sims with a high video game skill level is entering competitive game tournaments. Placing anywhere higher than third will net a payout, and Sims with a max skill level in gaming will almost always place here.





 4  Painting Masterpieces 
A Classic Way To Make Money
        

Painting is another way to utilize Sims&#39; hobbies to earn money, and another benefit is it&#39;s actually entertaining. While it does take a bit of time for Sims to complete a painting, you can watch the progress as they complete their masterpieces. To paint, Sims need to find an easel and initiate the action, but note that it will have an initial investment to begin painting. What Sims paint doesn&#39;t necessarily matter; their skill level will affect how much their painting sells for. Every so often, Sims will create something called a Masterpiece, which will sell for a very high price to collectors.





 3  Fishing Is A Great Way To Make Money 
Catch More Than Just Fish 
        

Though this isn&#39;t necessarily passive income in the same way that writing a book and gaining royalties is, Sims in Sims 4 will fish for as long as they are left there to do so. Meaning players can leave their Sim to fish for a while, and they will accrue a decent amount of Simoleons. Be aware, though, that it will be harder for the Sim to catch fish if their level is lower.
Additionally, Sims may occasionally catch things other than fish, but if players are fine letting their Sim stand around for a bit, they can make a good amount of money fairly quickly.





 2  Get Some Odd Jobs 
A Second Income
        

Unlike full careers in Sims 4, odd jobs are one-off jobs that a Sim can complete for the day for some spare money. To find them, head to the business app on the phone, where a list of odd jobs will be available. They&#39;ll occasionally ask for specific skills and note that being a better performer in that skill will mean the Sim does better on that odd job, resulting in more money. If the Sim has what&#39;s listed on the job, it will result in better performance and more pay. So be sure to pay attention to what is required for each posting.





 1  Build Your Career 
The Most Sensible Way To Make Money


The most obvious way to earn money is through careers. The current highest-paying career in Sims 4 is the Military path, available with The Sims 4 Strangerville Pack. There are two options on the Military Career path, but both will pay out the same when maxed, so the decision to go for either Grand Marshal or Sim-in-Black is entirely up to the player. Each maxed-out career path will pay an impressive $422 Simoleons per hour.
However, even if Sims 4 players do not wish to pursue a Military career, all the career options are an excellent way to earn consistent money throughout gameplay, and as with everything else, the more they advance, the more money they will make.
