## Literature Review

Prior to Spider-Man 2&#39;s launch, many had speculated that the title would set up Insomniac&#39;s Wolverine game, however, this was not the case.




Prior to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s launch, many had speculated that the title would set up Insomniac Games&#39; other Marvel title, Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, however, this was not the case. Despite both titles being announced at the same PlayStation Showcase back in 2021, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 opted to focus solely on Peter Parker and Miles Morales&#39; stories, although there were references to other Marvel heroes within the game&#39;s open world.




Marvel&#39;s Wolverine&#39;s announcement trailer featured Logan sitting in a bar following a brawl, and had plenty of Easter eggs in the background for eagle-eyed Marvel fans, with ones referring to Logan&#39;s alias Patch and certain locations in the Marvel Universe. However, outside that trailer, little has been confirmed about the game&#39;s story other than that it will be M-rated - which is more in keeping with some of Logan&#39;s more mature solo storylines - with Spec Ops: The Line&#39;s writer Walt Williams serving as Marvel&#39;s Wolverine&#39;s narrative lead.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.    


 Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Games Will Share The Same Universe 
          




Previously, Marvel had stated that its games wouldn&#39;t crossover, with EA&#39;s Iron Man and Black Panther games and Skydance New Media&#39;s untitled World War 2-set Black Panther and Captain America game taking place in their own individual universes. However, this was not the case for the titles being developed by Insomniac - who confirmed both Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and Marvel&#39;s Wolverine would exist within the same universe following the announcement of both games, suggesting that the Marvel game universes could be separated by studio instead.


 

During a recent episode of IGN&#39;s Beyond podcast, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s Senior Creative Director, Brian Intihar reiterated that Insomniac is building a shared universe, with the Insomniac Marvel Universe being deemed &#34;Earth-1048&#34; in Marvel&#39;s Multiverse. This had already been acknowledged in the comics and the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse movie, where Insomniac&#39;s version of Peter Parker had a cameo with the caption &#34;Insomniac Spider-Man of Earth-1048&#34; above his head.






 Insomniac Decided Not To Include A Wolverine Crossover In Spider-Man 2 
          

Despite this shared universe, Insomniac Games made the conscious decision not to have the characters crossing over in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Intihar explained the thinking behind this decision, stating &#34;I think I&#39;m trying to make Spider-Man, like I&#39;m just learning to try and how to make Spider-Man, get Spider-Man off the ground while there&#39;s another Marvel thing I&#39;m trying to get... I think for us it&#39;s just like, &#39;Hey, let&#39;s just let that team cook. Let them cook. Let them make the game they want to make. And who knows what the future holds, but right now let&#39;s let them do their thing, and that game is going to be great.&#34;


 




While this may have disappointed those hoping to see the fan-favorite mutant interacting with his fellow heroes, or potentially having a showdown with Venom similar to the one in 2005&#39;s Ultimate Spider-Man game, it does make sense why the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 team chose to give those working on Marvel&#39;s Wolverine some space. Insomniac is setting up its own take on Wolverine and is likely waiting to reveal that fully in a full storyline that will do it justice, rather than introducing him via a cameo or side-quest that may have been shoehorned in for fan service.

                  Marvel Games That Did Wolverine Right   Wolverine has had a long history in gaming, with several successful adaptations of the gruff, claw-bearing mutant across team-up and solo adventures.    



 A Recently Discovered Easter Egg Could Tease Wolverine&#39;s Enemies 
          




Many have speculated that a recently uncovered Easter egg in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 could be setting up the ninja clan, The Hand. While The Hand is primarily associated with Daredevil - who has also been teased in the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games via dialogue and a sign for his law firm in the open world - the group also has a history with Wolverine in the comics, with the mutant even being brainwashed and serving as one of the group&#39;s assassins at one point in Enemy of the State.

None of Logan&#39;s enemies have been confirmed so far as there&#39;s very little known about Marvel&#39;s Wolverine&#39;s story following its teaser trailer. With the comics&#39; history and Logan&#39;s tendency to travel the world with stories in Japan or Madrapoor it&#39;s possible that neither Spider-Man nor Daredevil could be facing the dangerous international clan in New York, and that this Easter egg could be a set-up for its appearance in Marvel&#39;s Wolverine instead.



Madripoor is a fictional island in the Marvel Universe and is a safe haven for those operating outside the law. It was teased in Marvel&#39;s Wolverine&#39;s announcement trailer.









 Spider-Man 2 Still References Wolverine 
          

Despite there being no Wolverine cameo or an in-world reference to him akin to those for The Avengers or Doctor Strange in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, the game does still have a reference to him through Miles&#39; suit collection. Upon reaching Level 52, players can unlock the &#34;The Best There Is&#34; suit for Miles. This suit is clearly inspired by Wolverine with its name being a nod to one of the mutant&#39;s most well-known catchphrases, and the mask distinctly resembling Wolverine&#39;s cowl. While the main version of the suit uses Miles&#39; traditional red and black color palette, the variants are all inspired by Wolverine&#39;s various costumes over the years.

There&#39;s a yellow and tan brown look, an X-Force-esque gray and black design with red eyepieces, and the classic yellow and blue available to swap between. It&#39;s yet to be confirmed whether Logan will sport his classic costume in Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, or if the team will choose to have him in more civilian clothing like his flannel shirt - as seen in the game&#39;s announcement trailer - and leather biker jacket, but &#34;The Best There Is&#34; suit combines the two with a leather jacket over a suit inspired more by his classic X-Men uniform.




With no confirmed release date for Marvel&#39;s Wolverine in sight, and Intihar&#39;s comments about giving the game&#39;s development team some space suggesting that the character won&#39;t appear in any Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 story DLC either, fans will have to wait to see exactly what Insomniac&#39;s take has in store. It has been reported that many developers at Insomniac have moved on to developing Marvel&#39;s Wolverine following Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s launch, however, so hopefully the wait won&#39;t be too long.
