## Literature Review

Within Disney Dreamlight Valley, Eternity Isle houses new gems for players to find and unlock, which are scattered throughout the various biomes.





The new gems are just one of many new additions to Disney Dreamlight Valley with the &#34;A Rift In Time&#34; expansion, and players will have to explore all of Eternity Isle to find all of them. There are many new resources and activities, as well as a plethora of new quests to unlock the new characters that have been added to the game, such as Gaston. Once players have made their way through the new areas, they can customize and decorate it just like the biomes found in the base game.




                  Disney Dreamlight Valley 2024 Roadmap: New Expansions &amp; Updates   Just because Disney Dreamlight Valley is officially out doesnâ€™t mean the devs are slowing down. Its 2024 roadmap is full of new content.   


 Where To Find Every Gem In Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Eternity Isle 
         

There are a total of five new gems available on Eternity Isle, along with shiny variants of each of them. Gems can be used to sell for coins and crafting recipes. To mine gem types and have enough for both, players will want to ensure they have enough energy. Fortunately, there are also many new recipes from the &#34;A Rift In Time&#34; DLC to give you all the energy you need to get the job done. Currently, the Blue Zircon is selling for the highest base price of all the new gems in the game.



The table below lists the gems and the shiny versions separately to show how much each is worth, the region, and the biome for each gem.







  Gem   Region   Biome   Selling Price    Alexandrite   The Wastes The Oasis   Glittering Dunes   350    Shiny Alexandrite   The Wastes The Oasis   Glittering Dunes   1400    Blue Zircon   The Lagoon   Wild Tangle   500    Shiny Blue Zircon   The Lagoon   Wild Tangle   2000    Bumblestone   The Borderlands   Glittering Dunes   400    Shiny Bumblestone   The Borderlands   Glittering Dunes   1600    Jade   The Courtyard The Overlook   Ancient&#39;s Landing   250    Shiny Jade   The Courtyard The Overlook   Ancient&#39;s Landing   1000    Spinel   The Promenade The Grove   Wild Tangle   450    Shiny Spinel   The Promenade The Grove   Wild Tangle   1800   



Once you have the gems and earn the rewards, you can focus on making Eternity Isle a dream destination for the characters and your friends. It is even possible to move villagers from the valley to Eternity Isle. With all the new options, players can truly make it an excellent place for everyone, and you can even show off your beautiful valley to a few friends at a time with the new multiplayer option. Having the extra gems for making this a reality will be an upside to anyone mining them in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
