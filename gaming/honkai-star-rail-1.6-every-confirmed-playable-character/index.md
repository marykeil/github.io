## Literature Review

Three new playable characters have been confirmed for Honkai: Star Rail 1.6, two of which are 5-star heroes. Here are more details about them.




The new playable characters in Honkai: Star Rail 1.6 were confirmed by HoYoverse much ahead of the actual version’s release. The turn-based RPG from the same developers of Genshin Impact is also a live-service game that often receives new content. Among the updates to story missions, introductions of limited-time events, and additions to quality-of-life features, the game also gets new playable characters, which deepen the gameplay mechanics and offer players further customization options when it comes to building teams in Honkai: Star Rail. With various elements and different Paths, which serve as roles in a classic RPG sense, players can mix and match different heroes for different occasions.




The fact that new heroes are arriving gives players more options to draw from and, even if there are no such things as elemental reactions in the game, there is a lot of unwritten synergy between characters. Blade, for instance, thrives on losing HP, while Luocha automatically can heal characters that fall below the 50% threshold, making them a fantastic duo. Even before the Honkai: Star Rail 1.5 livestream was held, HoYoverse announced three new playable characters for Version 1.6, and with the new bits of information shared about them, it seems like they will be valuable additions when they actually arrive.

 Three New Playable Characters Arrive In Honkai: Star Rail 1.6 
          




Three new characters were officially revealed. As is custom, HoYoverse shared the designs and small pieces of information about these characters ahead of the release of the version prior to their own – Version 1.5 has yet to arrive, but the Honkai: Star Rail 1.6 characters were announced. The characters, most of which had already been leaked or at least mentioned in leaks, are Ruan Mei, Dr. Ratio, and Xueyi. Two of these heroes are 5-stars, while one of them is a new 4-star. Additionally, while two of them have yet to make their debut in the game, one of them has already interacted with Trailblazers in the campaign.



 Who Ruan Mei Is In Honkai: Star Rail 
          

The first to be announced by a post on the official Honkai: Star Rail profile on X, Ruan Mei is a new 5-star character set to arrive in Version 1.6. She, who had been mentioned in several leaks but had not yet had her design revealed, has finally been shown by the developer. Ruan Mei is a character who uses Ice in combat and follows the Path of the Harmony. As such, she is expected to be a support character, capable of giving out some sort of buff to team members. She will be the first of her element and Path combination.





 

Ruan Mei seems to be a resident of the Xianzhou Luofu, or at least have been part of the Xianzhou fleet, as suggested by her clothing’s materials and style. According to the post made on X, Ruan Mei is a scholar and Member #81 of the Genius Society. This is the same group of which Herta and Screwllum participate – in fact, Ruan Mei, Screwllum, and Member #84, Stephen, worked together to create Herta’s Simulated Universe in Honkai: Star Rail. As such, it seems she has deep knowledge of technology, in addition to her well-known expertise in biological sciences. This expertise was what got her into the Genius Society.

She was first noticed by the Aeon Nous, the astral computer created by Zandar, when she was researching the origin of life in a “secret corner of the universe.” In addition to her merits as a scholar and a studious mind involved in the creation of the Simulated Universe, Ruan Mei is also very interested in arts and gastronomy. According to the post on X, the new Honkai: Star Rail Ice character adores traditional theater, as well as desserts, such as plum pastry. Ruan Mei also appreciates embroidery. These elements give a bit more depth to her character.






 Who Dr. Ratio Is In Honkai: Star Rail 
          

The second new playable character to be announced for Version 1.6 is called Dr. Ratio. There have been mentions of Dr. Ratio in Honkai: Star Rail since the game’s launch earlier this year, but he has now finally seen the light of day. As was announced on a post made by the official Honkai: Star Rail account on X, Dr. Ratio is a 5-star character. He wields the Imaginary element in battle and follows the Path of The Hunt. Like Ruan Mei, he will be the first to have this elemental and Path combination in the game. Based on his chosen Path, he will be a main DPS character.

Hunt characters’ main job is dealing high amounts of damage to individual targets. Nevertheless, his skill set may be quite different from the traditional standard, as was the case with Topaz and Numby in Honkai: Star Rail, for instance. Dr. Ratio is a member of the Intelligentsia Guild and is said to conceal his identity with a plaster sculpture. He is not only intelligent himself, but his goal is to spread knowledge across the universe in an attempt to eradicate ignorance, which he considers a disease. This goal also comes at a cost: Dr. Ratio is said to be self-centered and candid and may come across as a nuisance.






 Who Xueyi Is In Honkai: Star Rail 
         

The third and last new character to be introduced with Version 1.6 is called Xueyi. Like the other two characters, Xueyi was announced on the official Honkai: Star Rail page on X. Xueyi is a 4-star character who uses Quantum as her element in combat and follows the Path of the Destruction. In essence, this means she will likely be a main DPS hero. Xueyi has already been encountered a few times during the game, as she is one of the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. She is in charge of detaining criminals aboard the Xianzhou Alliance ships.

Xueyi is a puppet of the Commision and, additionally, sister to Hanya, one of the new characters to be added with Version 1.5. Like Xueyi, Hanya is also a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, but one in charge of interrogation. Xueyi’ skill set is also unknown at the moment, so it is hard to predict how she will compare to other Quantum heroes, as well as other Destruction characters in Honkai: Star Rail.
