## Literature Review

​​​​​​​Black Friday means great deals on shopping to stock up on holiday gifts or personal collections. Here’s what to expect for Pokémon TCG deals.




Collecting cards for the Pokémon Trading Card Game can be an expensive hobby, but taking advantage of Black Friday deals can help take a bit of pressure off of a budget. Whether looking for a great holiday gift for someone or adding to a personal collection, Pokémon TCG has some good deals this season. Of course, while many of these take place at the big-name stores, it is always a great idea to check with any friendly local game stores first to see if they are running any promotions for either Black Friday or Small Business Saturday to support the local communities.




Although it&#39;s still a bit early for Black Friday, many of the deals are already starting to be advertised or even already made available as both shoppers and retailers begin to make plans for the holidays. Both online and off, many retailers are stocking up on many of the great Pokémon TCG products that will make good holiday gifts. Most places use the day to put existing products on sale, which is wonderful, but there is at least one premium collection for a Crown Zenith VMAX set that is an impressive new deal.

                  Pokémon TCG: 10 Paradox Rift Cards You&#39;ll Definitely Want To Collect   Pokémon TCG’s upcoming Scarlet &amp; Violet: Paradox Rift expansion is introducing many new cards, including beautiful full-art collectible cards.    


 Crown Zenith Pikachu VMAX Premium Collection 
Exclusive To Walmart
          




The Special Collection Crown Zenith VMAX sets are popular items, particularly for gifting, but Walmart is adding some extra bonuses with its exclusive Premium Collection Pikachu VMAX box set. The Pokémon TCG: Crown Zenith sets may not make it to Black Friday, however, as they are scheduled to be released both in stores and online on November 10, 2023, with only a set limited supply available.


 

These larger collections are not only cheaper than their Special Collection counterparts but include all the same items plus more, including an adorable featured Gigantamax Pikachu pin. The Black Friday Pokémon TCG Premium Colleciton Pikachu VMAX box set has a retail price of $24.99.

                  Everything In Pokémon TCG&#39;s Holiday Calendar 2023   The 2023 Advent Calendar for the Pokémon Trading Card Game is out now, with V cards and more being offered up this holiday season.

Premium Has Two Extra Packs &amp; A Pin
          

Not only is the exclusive Pokémon TCG: Crown Zenith Pikachu VMAX Premium Collection $5.00 cheaper, it also provides more value with additional items. The inclusion of two more booster packs alone would make this worth more, but throwing in a new pin makes it even more impressive. Unfortunately, the sets are only available while supplies last at each store, and will probably go very quickly. Chances are, there won&#39;t be any of these boxes left on Black Friday.

If purchasing the Premium Collection from Walmart isn&#39;t a possibility, or they are sold out, the Special Collection is discounted on Amazon at the time of writing. That isn&#39;t the only sale available, though, with many other stores offering deals on different Pokémon TCG items in preparation for the holidays.

                  10 Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift Secret Rares Worth The Most Money   Pokémon Trading Card Game’s newest set Paradox Rift has over 80 beautiful Secret Rare cards included in it, which are already proving valuable.

 Check Local Stores For Black Friday Deals 
Support Local Game Stores Selling Pokémon TCG
          

Sometimes, the rarest and best deals are not the ones flashed all over the internet but might be provided by the small, local stores around the corner. Always take a moment to check out what the friendly game stores nearby have and check out if they are going to be hosting any special sales for either Black Friday or Small Business Saturday. Though not every place can do these kinds of sales, there are occasionally deals that are even better than the ones offered at the big stores and give the bonus of being able to help support the local community.

Black Friday can be a great time to save money, whether purchasing for holiday gift-giving or waiting to buy items for personal use or collecting. Pokémon cards are an expensive hobby and many of the sets don&#39;t often go on sale, which is why events such as these can be smart times to make those purchases. Keep an eye out for other deals as they are announced for various items for the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
