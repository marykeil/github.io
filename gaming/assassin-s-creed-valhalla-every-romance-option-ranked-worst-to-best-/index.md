## Literature Review

Eivor can partake in many optional romances in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, but which are ultimately the best (and worst) suitors for the Wolf-Kissed?




Although the world of Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla is often political, treacherous, and violent, Eivor can still find it in their heart to become intimate with many of the friendly faces they meet along the way - but not all of these encounters are equally written. Some suffer from a lack of a proper backstory and poor execution, whereas others showcase the opposite qualities, and thus have the potential to remain fondly in a player&#39;s memories long after they&#39;ve explored the Viking-themed RPG through and through. By examining every romance option in AC Valhalla, it becomes clear which partners are the best for Eivor, and which conversely leave something to be desired.
In Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla, romance is straightforward. Eivor can partake in everything from one-night stands to full-fledged relationships, and since players can swap between a female-presenting or male-presenting protagonist at any point in the game, there are no limitations based on gender. Instead, the only requirement for unlocking romance options in AC Valhalla, in most cases, will be completion of a side quest or two with the person of interest. Then, players will have to select a flirtatious dialogue option (which is clearly marked with a heart icon). With an easy-to-understand romance system, players are free to explore their options as they please, but they&#39;ll find that some characters make better lovers than others.

 13  Stowe Is AC Valhalla&#39;s Worst Romance 
Requires Arrival In Lunden
        

Stowe is a likable and steadfast character, but as a romance interest in AC Valhalla, he&#39;s at the bottom of the barrel. However, Stowe is relatively easy to romance. Eivor can begin hitting on him just as soon as they arrive in Lunden. As Stowe serves as a reeve, he&#39;s Eivor&#39;s first point of contact when they arrive in that city. Eivor helps him fend off a group of gatecrashers, and from there their romance develops.
But it quickly becomes obvious that Stowe is in a secret relationship with Erke; as a result, Eivor and Stowe have little to no chemistry, making flirtatious conversations between the two seem out of place. Stowe is also a more reserved individual, so there’s little to no passion involved in his relationship with Eivor. Even with introversion cast aside, though, his established and intimate dynamic with Erke makes a romance with Stowe rather jarring, making players feel like they&#39;re a third wheel. It&#39;s the worst romance in all of Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla.





 12  Pierre Is Just A Brief Fling In AC Valhalla 
Requires Completion Of &#34;Skal!&#34;
        

Even in the society of Vikings, short-lived flings are a valid romantic venture, with many seemingly preferring to stay noncommittal. Pierre falls under this category, but not in a favorable light, unfortunately. As an AC Valhalla romance option, he suffers from a lack of meaningful characterization.
During the Siege of Paris DLC, Pierre stays as a guest in Ravensthorpe. However, he and Eivor rarely meet during the latter’s stay in the area, and the option to have a physical interaction comes seemingly out of the blue. Eivor doesn&#39;t even have to complete any of Pierre&#39;s resistance side quests in order to romance him. They can effectively ignore the visitor until after completing &#34;Skal!&#34; and still have the opportunity to romance him. In fact, after their deed, the two even admit that it meant nothing. This instantly devalues the brief romance, and further highlights their lack of chemistry.





 11  Bil Is An Unimpactful Romance In AC Valhalla 
Requires Completion Of The &#34;Comb Of Champions&#34; World Event
        

As a side romance, Bil tasks the player with a humorous quest. If Eivor beats out her other potential suitors and manages to fetch her comb from a nearby lake, she&#39;ll reward them with a night together. Between her forthright attitude and Eivor’s playfulness, they make for a rather memorable pairing.
However, this romance has little to no bearing on Eivor’s character development, and thus, some might find that this AC Valhalla side quest isn&#39;t worth it in the end. Her dynamic with Eivor had potential, but sadly, she remains underdeveloped as a romance option in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla.





 10  Broder Is A Slow-Burn Lover In AC Valhalla 
Requires Liberation Of East Anglia
        

Exemplifying the slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers trope, Broder is one of the more unique romance options in the game. His relationship with the player is initially hostile, but it eventually turns to mutual respect, and even eventually lust if Eivor so desires. Broder is an important figure in Eivor&#39;s conquest of East Anglia, and, when they&#39;re celebrating their victory at Oswald&#39;s wedding, will proposition them.
While the progression of their acrimonious relationship into a friendly one is interesting to watch unfold, Broder&#39;s romance in AC Valhalla is still somewhat lacking, since it isn&#39;t explored much besides a single, one-off moment. Just like Bil, he could benefit from a more complex and meaningful relationship arc.





 9  Gunlodr&#39;s Romance Is Good, But Too Short 
Requires Completion Of &#34;A Gift From The Past&#34;
        

It&#39;s easy to miss Gunlodr&#39;s romance, as it’s a rather fleeting moment. It takes place during the Asgard storyline, which runs concurrently with the main quest after Eivor has built Valka the Seer&#39;s hut in Ravensthorpe. The majority of her interactions with Havi involve calculating the likelihood of the catastrophe for the Isu’s future, but there’s a moment where players can take it further.
On the second visit to Asgard, Eivor (as Havi) finds Thor&#39;s bridal circlet, which they can present to Gunlodr in order to woo her. Herein, Havi can reveal their attraction to Gunlodr, which she’s surprised at, but receptive to. Although it’s not the longest interaction, the romance does have solid chemistry, and the moment doesn’t seem forced or crass like some other sudden flings. This makes her a solid romance in AC Valhalla for those who can manage to find it.





 8  Tewdwr&#39;s Romance Ends Poorly In AC Valhalla 
Requires Completion Of &#34;The Burning Of The Wicker Man&#34;
        

Tewdwr&#39;s romance in AC Valhalla is one of the odder ones, as it&#39;s one of few that end off on a rather sour note. Tewdwr is kind toward Eivor and is easily charmed by the latter due to his inexperience with relationships. The two end up getting along quite quickly, as Eivor helps Tewdwr grow from a wayward naif to a confident leader, an ealdorman of his people.
Even after selecting the romantic dialogue option during their initial conversation, players must finish the quest &#34;The Burning Of The Wicker Man&#34; before they can pursue anything intimate with him. But despite the amount of time their feelings are given to simmer, Eivor dumps Tewdwr straight after they get together, bringing things to an abrupt and harsh end.





 7  Vili And Eivor Have History In AC Valhalla 
Requires Liberation Of Snotinghamscire
        

As Eivor’s childhood friend, Vili shares some underlying history with the protagonist, which can be further explored during his romance arc. As the two fire well-meaning shots at each other’s expense, there is a clear build-up of tension that can lead to something more (if Eivor plays their cards right).
While it&#39;s made clear that the pair aren&#39;t looking for a long-term relationship, their attraction to each other is natural and easy to follow. Vili had the potential to be one of AC Valhalla&#39;s best romanceable characters had the two committed to each other - but even as a short fling, he manages to be one of the more worthwhile characters to grow closer with.





 6  Ciara&#39;s Romance Takes Time In AC Valhalla 
Requires Beginning The Quest &#34;Into The Fog&#34; In The Wrath Of The Druids DLC


 







Although AC Valhalla&#39;s Wrath of the Druids missed some opportunities generally, Eivor and Ciara&#39;s romance is certainly not among the pitfalls of the expansion. Ciara is a respected poet and a member of a druid family. The two can quickly develop a flirtatious relationship, with Eivor being drawn to Ciara’s spunky attitude, and the latter being receptive to the attention she receives from the protagonist.
Ciara&#39;s romance in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla is gratifying, since the two will get to know each other before taking things to the next level, giving players a reason to like their pairing. Ciara may even reject Eivor if they come onto her during &#34;Foothold in Connacht,&#34; but will attempt to seduce them again much later in the DLC. This could have potentially been one of the best in the game, had the story not later veered into turning Ciara into Eivor&#39;s potential enemy.

 5  Stigr&#39;s Romance Is Short, But Entertaining In AC Valhalla 
Requires Victory In Hemthorpe&#39;s Flyting Contest
        

Stigr barely interacts with Eivor before their optional fling, but their romance together still ends up being rather entertaining due to the flyting competition. The pair can charm one another as they fire off playful insults during the minigame, eventually turning an amusing exchange between the two into an amorous encounter.
Although there’s no real underlying reason for the two to get intimate, it’s a natural progression in the end, given how their banter progressively escalates. Since Stigr manages to leave an impression after such a brief interaction, he’s altogether one of the better and more lighthearted romance options in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla.





 4  Tarben 
Requires A Bakery In Ravensthorpe
        

Once they&#39;ve built a bakery in Ravensthorpe, Eivor spends a fair amount of time bonding with the charming baker Tarben, both before and during their relationship. He&#39;s the only male romance option that can be taken further than a short hook-up, and as a result, the two end up sharing a real, feasible connection that the player may find themselves naturally invested in.
The progression of their relationship plays out quite similarly as one would in real life, with Eivor and Tarben first spending time together and doing things that they enjoy before diving into intimate relations. He&#39;ll even take any potential break-ups quite gracefully, continuing to journal kind words about the protagonist (although there is little to no reason to end things with Tarben, as he&#39;s one of AC Valhalla&#39;s best romance options).





 3  Estrid&#39;s Romance Is Daring And Satisfying In AC Valhalla 
Requires Completion Of &#34;Taken&#34;
        

As the unhappy wife of Birstan, Estrid awaits her knight in shining armor, and the protagonist can assume this role by initiating a romance with her. She&#39;ll ask Eivor to stage a fake kidnapping so that she can return to her homeland, and if they oblige, the mission has a chance to turn flirtatious.
Although Estrid&#39;s romance in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla is short-lived, it&#39;s one of the more meaningful flings that the player can take part in. Besides getting to spend time with an intelligent and refined woman, they&#39;ll also have the pleasure of knowing they&#39;ve saved her from a lifetime of misery in her arranged marriage, making it a win-win situation.





 2  Randvi&#39;s Is A Risky Affair In AC Valhalla 
Requires A Level Three Settlement


 







As Sigurd&#39;s wife, Randvi is certainly the most dangerous romance in the entire game. Pursuing her as a partner will understandably complicate things between Eivor and their brother, ultimately impacting the story and making it more difficult to attain AC Valhalla&#39;s best ending - but daring players will be rewarded with a fiery dynamic that&#39;s quite different from any other potential suitor.
If Eivor is willing to put their morals aside, they&#39;ll be met with a powerful woman who ultimately shares the same values and interests as them. For this reason, it&#39;s unsurprising that Randvi is one of the more popular romance options in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla, but the adversity that the protagonist must face to win her heart bumps her down to second place.





 1  Petra Is AC Valhalla&#39;s Best Romance Option 
Requires Completion Of &#34;The Huntress&#34;


 







Petra is AC Valhalla&#39;s best romance option, because unlike Randvi, wooing her has no negative consequences on the game&#39;s story or ending. Instead, starting a relationship with her only stands to flesh out the player&#39;s experience in a positive, wholesome way - and combined with her lovable and caring personality, there&#39;s little to no reason for those interested not to romance Petra.
Eivor meets Petra while hunting, and just like any good relationship, it takes some time (and some rather entertaining quests) for the tension to build between the two. Once they finally admit their love for one another, though, their undeniable compatibility shines through. Petra, being the caring woman that she is, respects Eivor’s need for adventure, while the latter cherishes Petra’s honesty and empathy. Those looking for a genuine, sweet romance option in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla should thus look to Petra, as the huntress will ensure that each visit leaves Eivor with a broad smile and a warm heart.
