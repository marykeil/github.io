## Literature Review

November 2nd’s Wordle answer might cause problems for players who stick to using their regular starting words or avoid using relevant hints. 





To solve today’s answer, you might have an easier time using Wordle’s hard mode. While the name might sound a bit intimidating, this mode is used by many veterans to solve Wordle every day. As this mode does not let you reuse confirmed letters in different spots, it prevents you from using random words as attempts. However, many find this mode a bit more time-consuming, so if you want to solve the puzzle faster, you might want to use some hints.
