Latias is obtainable in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disk DLC after the player has finished the main story line of the Blueberry Academy.





Latias is an exclusive Legendary to Pokémon Violet, unlocked through Blue Berry Quests or BBQs. However, through internet connectivity, Pokémon Scarlet players can obtain her through Group BBQs. After completing the main quests in The Indigo Disk, an NPC called Snacksworth will be waiting for you at the entrance to the Blueberry Academy. Once he gives you the Latias Treat for the BBQs, you&#39;ll be able to seek Latias right away.

 Tips for Catching Latias in The Indigo Disk 
          

Once Latias is found in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet save the game in front of her. This means that if she faints, or you run out of Pokéballs, you can just try to catch her by switching your console off and back on again. Make sure to stock up on Pokéballs such as Quick Balls, Ultra Balls, and Timer Balls to have a better chance at catching her. Finally, make sure to bring a Pokémon like Darkrai, Dialga, and Palkia that can resist Dragon- and Psychic-type moves because her attacks are very strong.



The status condition Sleep is the best for catching Pokémon with. Consider using moves such as Spore, Sleep Powder, or Sing.
