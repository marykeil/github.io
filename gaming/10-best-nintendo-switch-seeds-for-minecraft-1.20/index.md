## Literature Review

Minecraft players on Nintendo Switch can use seeds to generate custom worlds with spectacular scenery and access to rare resources and structures.





The Nintendo Switch runs Minecraft’s Bedrock Edition, so many of Minecraft 1.20’s best seeds will work just fine on Nintendo’s hybrid console. However, the best seeds will also depend on how you and your friends like to play. Survival Mode players might prefer worlds with lots of rare structures and resources, while Creative Mode players might want the most picturesque landscapes as backdrops for their latest creations.









 








 10  Shipwreck Coast 
Seed: 2449693233269205895


 







This seed spawns players on the coast, right on the edge between the Savannah and Forest biomes. This gives you easy access to mobs from both biomes, including sheep, chickens, pigs, and Llamas, which typically only spawn in Savannah biomes. These all produce useful resources, and Llamas can even be turned into pack animals by giving them chests.
This seed produces a lovely ocean view, with plenty of space for you to start a peaceful homestead. It’s a great choice for a Minecraft Survival Mode seed. 

Perhaps the most interesting and unique feature of the local area is a small island at -304, 54, -452. On the shoreline, you can find a beached Shipwreck, fully intact with chests containing useful resources including food, ingots, and Smithing Templates for Armor Trims. Shipwrecks typically spawn underwater, so finding one on dry land is an extremely rare find. If you’re interested in roleplaying, you can even convert it into a shelter for that crucial first night out in the wilderness.





 9  Mangrove Swamp 
Seed: 2087273094989673689
        

This seed is a particularly great choice for any environmentalists, spawning you inside a Mangrove Swamp biome on the edge of some desert islands. Minecraft’s Mangrove Swamps are home to rare mobs such as Frogs and Tropical Fish, and you can also explore them to find rare Mangrove Propagules. These eventually grow into Mangrove Trees, allowing you to expand and restore these threatened swampland areas.
You can also breed Frogs in Minecraft, and they’ll even produce rare Froglight blocks when they consume small magma cubes. 

Off the nearby coast, you’ll also find a warm ocean biome with vibrant coral reefs teeming with fish. These don’t contain any particularly useful resources, but they’re nice to look at. Just outside the Mangrove Swamp areas, there are large flat beaches that are perfect for building on, whether you’re planning a new base or a unique Creative Mode build.





 8  The Lake Village 
Seed: -2260271473441531330


 







Found by Reddit user u/YourLocalKnight, this seed features one of Minecraft’s villages at -425, 65, -400. The village rests in the middle of a large and very deep lake, with a couple of sky islands creating waterfalls that pour down into the village itself. Luckily, the waterfalls have been generated in a way that doesn’t damage any of the buildings or structures.
Apart from the useful items and services you can obtain in Villages, players can also explore the lake to find a massive Ocean Monument that stretches from the surface down to incredible depths. Ocean Monuments are the only places where hostile Guardian mobs will spawn. If you’re familiar with setting up redstone mechanisms, you can easily create one of Minecraft’s best XP farms to harvest lots of XP from Guardians.
There’s an incomplete Nether portal on the edge of the Ocean Monument, making it much easier for you and your friends to make a trip to the Nether. 






 7  The Savannah 
Seed: 3144402394356182322
        

This seed spawns you in the middle of a Savannah biome, with two large Savannah Villages within easy walking distance of each other. Sadly, both have been long abandoned, but with a bit of Creative Mode magic or by curing some Zombie Villagers, you can repopulate both settlements. Both Villages have a focus on farming, producing lots of edible crops that you can eat to keep hunger at bay during your first few days.
Make sure to tame one of the wild cats roaming the area. A tamed Cat will scare away Phantoms and Creepers. 

One of the Villages also sits on the edge of a sinkhole that leads straight to an Abandoned Mineshaft, giving you a fantastic starting point for mining in the depths. The caverns below the Village run far below the ground, putting you at the best levels to find some Diamonds.





 6  The Stone Lake 
Seed: 22062004
        

Found by Reddit user u/Rusty_Amunition, this seed spawns players near a rather unique geological feature: a large and deep lake surrounded on all sides by stone hills. For gameplay purposes, the lake is considered part of the lukewarm ocean biome. As such, you can spot schools of fish, squid and even pods of dolphins swimming around: a rare sight, especially when the ocean isn’t anywhere near your starting location.
It’s a great seed for some unique Creative Mode builds, and an option for Survival Mode players who want to challenge themselves. The lakeside cliffs feature lots of Coal Ore, and there are also deep underwater caverns with rich veins of Ore. Underwater mining is an extremely dangerous endeavor even for experienced players, so getting minerals from beneath the lake poses quite a challenge.





 5  The Mansion Village 
Seed: -1558256749950985942


 







This seed was discovered by Reddit user u/Fragrant_Result_186. At 300, 150, 350, you’ll find a lakeside Village with an incomplete Nether Portal, a Pillager Outpost, and a gigantic Woodland Mansion all within a few steps of each other. This makes for a chaotic starting point for any Survival Mode adventure, as the Village will be constantly raided by hostile Pillagers and threatened by hostile mobs that spawn inside the Mansion.
However, you can also take up arms to defend the Village, defeat the Pillagers, and then explore inside the Woodland Mansion. Woodland Mansions contain many different rooms, ranging from libraries and dining halls to jails and galleries containing giant cat statues. Woodland Mansions and Pillager Outposts are also the only places you can find Minecraft’s rare Allay mobs. Allays can pick up and deliver items, love music, and are rather adorable.
You can find several Allays locked up in jail cells in a room on the ground floor. 






 4  Bamboo Forest Island 
Seed: 7144307065495859999
        

This seed spawns you on an island with a Jungle biome that contains dozens and dozens of fast-growing Bamboo plants. The island is separated from the mainland by a small strait of water, and has plenty of flat grassland for construction. There’s a great mix of the two biomes, as you can tame Ocelots for protection against Creepers, tame Parrots for fun, and harvest resources such as Melons and Cocoa Beans.
Melons are one of the best crops to farm in Minecraft, so this seed offers you the opportunity to start farming your own. 

At the same time, you also have plenty of room to build. The island itself is also resource-rich and great for exploration. Deep caverns and lush caves can be found beneath the island and are easily accessible from the surface via sinkholes. Finally, there’s even a Jungle Temple in the water nearby, which players can explore to find extra items and resources.





 3  The Hidden Meadow 
Seed: 6487992
        

Discovered by Reddit user u/QibliTF, this seed spawns you on the edge of a giant meadow surrounded all on sides by snowy mountains. It’s a dream for Creative Mode players, offering a scenic landscape that still acts as a perfectly blank canvas for building the largest structures you can imagine. However, Survival Mode players might also want to take a look.
There’s no shortage of room to build and expand a home base, and sinkholes scattered around the area lead deep underground to a network of twisting caves and caverns. There are underground lakes and dizzying drops that lead even further down. Intrepid explorers can even find rare Diamond Ore deep below the ground.
This seed also works in Java Edition but will spawn in a Village in the meadow area. 






 2  The River Village 
Seed: -5043669384686102288
        

This seed places you right next to a thriving coastal Village that stretches inland, crossing a small river. The empty grasslands give you space to build your own home, and you can even spot various interesting features within walking distance. The first is an incomplete Nether Portal, sitting right on the edge of a sinkhole that leads down to a cavern with an Abandoned Mineshaft.
You can visit Villages to trade with Minecraft’s Villagers for useful items and resources, as well as settle in them yourself. 

The second is one of Minecraft’s new Cherry Blossom biomes, which can be tricky to find without using seeds. However, with this seed, you can find one on a hillside just upriver from your spawn point.





 1  The Lush Cave Island 
Seed: -950547527103331411
        

Found by Reddit user u/Rusty_Amunition, this seed spawns you on a seemingly normal island, but dig down, and you’ll uncover an incredible open-air lush cave, with a truly spectacular view of the surrounding tropical ocean. Lush caves are fairly uncommon, and it’s hard to find one that isn’t totally underground.
Aside from giving you a unique space to build, you can also find and spawn some Blue Axolotls in the lush cave. Axolotls can only be found in lush caves, so they’re generally quite rare compared to other mobs. They’re also surprisingly useful in combat and can provide passive buffs when joining players in a fight.
These are just some of the best seeds for Minecraft on Nintendo Switch. Being able to enjoy the iconic sandbox game on the go is just one of the perks of owning Nintendo’s hybrid console. However, it’s worth keeping in mind that these seeds will also work on any platform using Minecraft’s Bedrock Edition, so they should work on other consoles too.
