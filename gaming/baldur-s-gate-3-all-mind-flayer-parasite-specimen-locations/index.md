If you want to get every Mind Flayer Parasite Specimen, you will have to get them from every infected companion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, such as Shadowheart and Wyll. You will have to kill these companions, removing them from the rest of the story. Killing your companions might not be a great idea, and instead, it would be wise to collect Mind Flayer Parasite Specimens from the following locations.
