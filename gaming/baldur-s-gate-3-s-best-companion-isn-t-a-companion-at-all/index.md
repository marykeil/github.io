# Baldur s Gate 3 s Best Companion Isn t A Companion At All


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is full of memorable companions, but Scratch is one of the best, despite not being a companion in the traditional sense.   While Scratch may not have a rich story or engaging banter like other party members, he is low maintenance and worth having around for his genuinely helpful abilities.   It&#39;s easy to forget about summoning Scratch amid the chaos of managing a party, but he should not be overlooked as he can provide valuable support and add an enjoyable element to the game.

## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a strong variety of distinct companion characters, but they aren&#39;t the only ones worth inviting to the party in the campaign.




The companions of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are among the most memorable aspects of the game, but one of the best characters to have around isn&#39;t even a companion in the traditional sense. Although the word &#34;companion&#34; can mean a lot of different things in real life, it specifically refers to potential party members in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, who fill out an adventuring group in the same way that Dungeons &amp; Dragons players would at the game table (or in a multiplayer Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaign). It&#39;s consequently no surprise that companions tend to be some of the most interesting characters in the game.




The initial batch of companions introduced in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are all Origin characters, meaning they can be chosen at character creation to fill the role of the protagonist as well. Other party members that can be recruited later on lack the mind flayer parasite that infects the minds of the Origin characters, but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have interesting arcs and challenges of their own. It&#39;s also possible to adventure with a few characters who don&#39;t qualify as companions at all, from hirelings to summons that help out in combat or various challenges.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Scratch Is One Of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Best Characters 
          




Setting aside arguments about which male companion has the best romance arc in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the game&#39;s real best boy is Scratch, a dog that can be found near the Blighted Village in Act 1. Scratch has a lot more to offer than just being adorable, even if that might be reason enough to invite him along to camp. As a familiar that can always be summoned, there&#39;s no risk in making use of Scratch in dangerous situations, and he can be easily summoned by keeping a ball that he procures on-hand in a character&#39;s inventory.



 Scratch Is A Huge Help In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Scratch&#39;s most iconic ability is his skill at sniffing out secrets, as keeping the dog on hand can make it easier to find buried treasure hidden throughout the game. Moreover, he can be especially useful in combat through his access to the Help action, which lets him stabilize downed characters (by licking them!) and keep battles from turning deadly. Although he doesn&#39;t have much health, his other stats are decent enough for combat, so he can help get a bit of extra damage to beat Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s most challenging bosses.




It&#39;s easy to forget about summoning Scratch, as there&#39;s more than enough to juggle with a standard party of four adventurers. All the same, it&#39;s a waste not to keep Scratch around in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and make use of his genuinely helpful abilities, and having a dog trotting along after the party is a nice treat in general. Scratch may not feature a rich story or a surplus of memorable banter like proper Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 party members, but he&#39;s certainly lower maintenance than any of them and definitely worth taking along for the ride.
