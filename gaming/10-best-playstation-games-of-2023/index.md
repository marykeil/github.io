## Literature Review

PlayStation owners were given an array of amazing new games to play in 2023, with high-quality titles from big names as well as some surprises.




2023 was a good year for gaming, particularly for PlayStation consoles, which saw many incredible games, including exclusive titles, launch on the PS4 and PS5 systems. From the highly anticipated Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy 16 to exclusive content on PlayStation for games like Hogwarts Legacy, Sony&#39;s console has done well to stand out from the crowd. These all gave owners of the systems great games to enjoy throughout the year, and even more to look forward to moving into the future.
PlayStation is home to many exclusive franchises, but as one of the major console competitors, presents an impressively smooth and high-quality experience for games that are not restricted to any one system. Games such as 2023&#39;s Game of the Year at The Game Awards, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, play well on the PS5 and allow users of that system to enjoy these titles with the added benefit of chasing Platinum trophies. Therefore, not every game in this list is exclusive to the PlayStation systems, yet all are must-plays for Sony&#39;s fans.
How we choose entries for our Best-Of Lists. 
For this List, Screen Rant has considered the critic scores of gaming aggregator Metacritic, our own reviews, and the awards each game has won. Writer Carrie Lambertsen has also applied her years of experience to critically evaluate these picks. Audience expectation and what really makes a “Best of the genre” have also been a critical factor in the creation of this article.
