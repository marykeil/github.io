## Literature Review

Archaludon is a Steel-/Dragon-type you can find in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC when you catch a Duraludon and evolve it with an item.





There is no place to catch Archaludon in The Indigo Disk, or find the Pokémon in the wild areas of the expanded content&#39;s new map. However, you can capture Duraludon in the Polar Biome area to obtain the Pokémon that evolves into the desired Steel-/Dragon-type. If you unlock flying in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s DLC, you have a good chance of spotting a Duraludon quickly as you explore.






Those who own Pokémon Sword and Shield can transfer a Duraludon they own to their save file in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet by using the trading system present in Pokémon Home.




                  All Pokémon That Can Be Transferred To Scarlet &amp; Violet From HOME   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are getting over 100 creatures and forms not previously obtainable in the Generation 9 games. Here are all of them.   


 How to Evolve Duraludon into Archaludon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC 
          

Duraludon evolves into Archaludon when you use the Metal Alloy item on the Pokémon, but you can only get this object by spending 300 Battle Points (BP) at the Blueberry Academy Store. BP is earned when you finish side quests seen on the Terarium&#39;s computer consoles. These can range from simply catching a certain Pokémon for 30-40 BP to battling a trainer or two in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.




Thankfully, you can buy as many Metal Alloys as you want when you have enough BP to spend. Your Duraludon does not have to be a certain level to evolve, or have to be traded with the Metal Alloy attached. Those looking to have a small army of Archaludons just need to keep accepting available quests to farm BP in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet for multiple instances of the item.

Some of the Pokémon that work best in a team with Archaludon are Swampert or Torterra, whose Water-/Ground-type or Grass-/Ground-type traits can balance your roster. These pocket monsters come from Gen 3 and Gen 4 starter Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s DLC that you can unlock from a different mission that boosts the biodiversity of different map regions.

Once you find and catch a Duraludon, you have a chance to create a powerful Archaludon in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet that will be a strong ally in future battles.
