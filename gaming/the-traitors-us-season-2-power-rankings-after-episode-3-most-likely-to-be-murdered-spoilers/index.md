The Traitors US season 2&#39;s third murder is like nothing seen before on the mystery show. Which of the faithfuls is most likely to survive it?




Summary
 The Traitors US season 2 traitors--Parvati Shallow, Dan Gheesling, and Phaedra Parks--must murder a faithful in plain sight. 
 Parvati and Dan considered murdering John Bercow, Shereé Whitfield, or MJ Javid. 
 The Traitors US season 2 episode 3 ended with a cliffhanger, not yet revealing the murder. 


The Traitors US season 2 episode 3 introduced a major plot twist for the traitors--murder in plain sight--and there are some faithfuls who are more likely than others to survive this game-changing turn of events. The Traitors US season 2 features Dan Gheesling, Phaedra Parks, and Parvati Shallow as the traitors. Dan and Phaedra murdered Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio in the traditional manner of sending a letter via Alan to Johnny&#39;s room, revealing his elimination. Dan, Phaedra, and their recruit, Parvati, then murdered Marcus Jordan. However, Alan then revealed that the third murder would be a murder in plain sight, committed by the traitors by the end of the night, without getting caught.
The traitors had to retrieve a poisoned chalice from the library, and then somehow get one of the faithfuls to drink from it, murdering them with a slow-acting poison. Phaedra didn&#39;t usually hang out with Dan and Parvati, so she let them take the lead. After Dan helped Parvati retrieve the chalice, he left it up to her to commit the murder. Peppermint and Maks Chmerkovskiy were previously banished. Because Janelle Pierzina, Peter Weber, and Tamra Judge earned shields during the day&#39;s mission, they had immunity. Of the 11 eligible contestants, here&#39;s who might be the traitors&#39; next murder victim, ranked from least to most likely.
            
 
 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now 
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?












 








 11  Deontay Wilder 
Professonal Boxer
        

After Deontay led the charge against Maks during the second banishment and was proven wrong, he was devastated. He cried and had to be comforted by his fellow contestants. It would only add insult to injury if Parvati tried to murder him. Plus, Deontay really doesn&#39;t pose much of a threat to the traitors at this point.





 10  Shereé Whitfield 
The Real Housewives Of Atlanta


 







Because Phaedra wasn&#39;t involved in the murder in plain sight, Parvati and Dan considered murdering Phaedra&#39;s fellow Real Housewife Shereé Whitfield, but Parvati thought that Phaedra would never allow them to do it. Dan pointed out that Phaedra wouldn&#39;t have to defend Shereé if they decided to murder her without Phaedra&#39;s knowledge. Parvati worried that Phaedra would be angry if they murdered Shereé, but Dan reassured her that they could come up with a good reason why they did, such as the fact that she&#39;s so quiet. Therefore, they don&#39;t know what Shereé&#39;s next move will be.
During The Traitors US season 2 episode 3, Parvati considered murdering Shereé, but quickly realized that it would be a bad idea. Phaedra became nervous when she noticed that Parvati had the chalice near Shereé. She said in her confessional, &#34;while it&#39;s a game, she will not be killed on my watch.&#34; Phaedra was relieved when Parvati left the room with the chalice without murdering Shereé.
Parvati said in her confessional that she knew what she could get away with, and what she couldn&#39;t. She stated that she wasn&#39;t going to stick her neck out and try to kill someone who was in the middle of an insulated group. She decided to abort the Shereé mission and left the room. It&#39;s highly unlikely that Parvati will return to that plan.

Janelle Pierzina is a contestant on The Traitors season 2. Here&#39;s why her legendary Big Brother gameplay makes her perfect for this game of deception.








 9  Mercedes &#34;MJ&#34; Javid 
Shahs Of Sunset
        

MJ was one of the contestants whom Dan and Parvati discussed murdering, but they were unsure if it would be too obvious since she&#39;d just voted against Dan at the last banishment. However, Parvati decided to maybe try her luck with her anyway. Parvati wondered how she was going to get MJ to drink out of the &#34;rusty old cup.&#34; She knew that MJ wouldn&#39;t do it, so she abandoned that plan. It&#39;s doubtful that Parvati will go back to the idea of murdering MJ.





 8  Larsa Pippen 
The Real Housewives Of Miami


Since Larsa is another Real Housewives franchise member, Parvati most likely won&#39;t try to murder her either. The traitors already murdered Larsa&#39;s other closest ally, her boyfriend, Marcus, so that threat has been removed. Although Larsa accused Dan of being a traitor at the last round table, she wasn&#39;t at the top of their hit list. Perhaps if Dan had taken the lead on the murder, he might&#39;ve impulsively decided to murder Larsa if he had the chance. However, he left it up to Parvati, who has no reason to murder Larsa. In fact, having Larsa there to shine a spotlight on Dan could be an asset to Parvati as she hides in the shadows.





 7  Chris &#34;CT&#34; Tamburello 
The Challenge


 







CT doesn&#39;t pose a threat to the traitors at all. They&#39;re not on his radar, and he hasn&#39;t done anything to upset them. CT is actually a great asset to the team because he&#39;s a competition beast who&#39;s great at helping them win money in the missions. Also, they&#39;ve already weakened him by murdering his ally, Johnny, on night one. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense for Parvati to murder CT at this point in the game.





 6  Sandra Diaz-Twine 
Survivor
        

Sandra is a fierce competitor, who&#39;s a two-time Survivor winner. However, murdering her wouldn&#39;t be a good move for Parvati right now. On The Traitors US season 2 premiere night, Sandra and Parvati reunited after appearing on Survivor: Heroes Vs. Villains, during which Sandra won and Parvati was the runner-up. Parvati admitted in her confessional that they had contention between them about who&#39;s the true Queen of Survivor. However, Peppermint encouraged them to declare a truce. Parvati told Sandra they should keep each other alive as long as they could.
In her confessional, Sandra said she&#39;d stick to her word, but at the first sign of deception from Parvati, she&#39;d take care of her once and for all. It would be a bad idea for Parvati to cross Sandra now. Also, Sandra hasn&#39;t identified any of the traitors at the round table discussions, and she could actually be an ally to them moving forward.

 5  John Bercow 
Former British Parliament Member
        

Parvati and Dan discussed possibly murdering John, but Dan pointed out that maybe they should eliminate a woman since the first two murders were men, and that might raise suspicion about Dan being a traitor. However, John&#39;s name was still on their hit list as Parvati left to complete the mission. Although John would be an easy target since he&#39;s not really aligned with anyone and doesn&#39;t pose much of a threat to the traitors, he&#39;s not in the room where Parvati is about to commit the murder, so he&#39;s most likely safe for now.





 4  Kevin Kreider 
Bling Empire


Kevin has been playing a very different game from the others. He and Peter are aligned, and they each voted against the other at the round table, to try to hide their alliance. None of the contestants seem to see Kevin as a serious threat, so he&#39;s most likely not on Parvati&#39;s radar. However, if she had to make a split second decision about the murder, he&#39;d be an easy target for her because there wouldn&#39;t be much fallout if he left the game.





 3  Trishelle Cannatella 
The Challenge
        

Although Trishelle hasn&#39;t had any problems with any of the traitors so far, she did have an early confrontation with Peppermint that led to the latter&#39;s exit. However, Trishelle is in the room in which Parvati announced that she finally found her target at the end of episode 3. Parvati described herself as &#34;a full-on poisonous spider crawling up to get you when you least expect it.&#34; If Parvati is desperate to complete the mission quickly, she might murder Trishelle just because it&#39;s convenient.





 2  Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu 
Love Island UK


Ekin-Su was at the center of some drama, when she argued that Janelle had stolen the shield from her during the mission. Also, Ekin-Su is in the room with Parvati, where the murder will be committed. Although Parvati could throw suspicion onto Phaedra if she murders Ekin-Su because Phaedra voted against Ekin-Su at the round table, Ekin-Su might be a good choice for her. The traitors will assume that either Janelle, who clashed with her, or Phaedra who voted for her, murdered her, and keep the focus off of Parvati. However, Parvati will have to find a way to get Ekin-Su to drink from the chalice.





 1  Carsten &#34;Bergie&#34; Bergersen 
Love Island USA


 







As one of the most innocent The Traitors US season 2 contestants, it&#39;s easy to imagine Parvati manipulating Bergie into drinking from the poisoned chalice. He might not be the most strategic choice. However, with time quickly running out, Parvati could make one last attempt with the contestant she might feel she&#39;s most likely to be able to trick into drinking from the chalice - Bergie.
The Traitors US season 2 episode 3 cliffhanger has left viewers on the edges of their seats. With the clock ticking, Parvati is going to have to make a quick decision without being too obvious. She pointed out that her fellow contestants were on high alert after banishing another faithful, Maks, so they&#39;ll be on the lookout for any suspicious behavior from anyone. While Parvati is a fantastic gamer, this is a situation in which she might have to rely on her instincts rather than strategy, as she makes a choice based on the circumstances. Really, none of the eligible contestants are safe as long as Parvati has the poisoned chalice in her traitorous hands.
The Traitors US season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
