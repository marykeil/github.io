# You re Going To Want To Ignore Crime In Marvel s Spider-Man 2


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 features in-game podcasts that add depth to the game&#39;s world and offer different perspectives on the heroes&#39; actions.   The podcasts, such as J. Jonah Jameson&#39;s &#34;Just the Facts&#34; and Danika Hart&#39;s &#34;The Danikast,&#34; provide insight into how the city views Spider-Man and his struggles.   Unfortunately, players cannot revisit the podcast episodes once they have been listened to, which may lead them to prioritize listening over engaging in in-game criminal activities.

## Literature Review

Peter and Miles stop plenty of crimes in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but one missable feature may make players turn a blind eye to some of them.




As one would expect from a superhero title, Peter Parker and Miles Morales put an end to many criminal activities in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Alongside dealing with the main story&#39;s threats of Kraven and his army of hunters, and Venom, there are several additional foes to be found across the game&#39;s New York map, such as a sadistic cult. However, players may want to ignore some of these if they want to experience all of the game&#39;s content.

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, much like its predecessors has several different collectibles that help build out Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe. These can either be references to other characters, such as Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s backpacks and Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s Spider-Bots, or they can expand upon characters seen in the game, like the Mysterium Dev Diaries, or Flint Marko (aka. Sandman)&#39;s memories in the form of crystals.

  


 Spider-Man&#39;s Podcasts Are Great For Worldbuilding 
          




One returning element to the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series is the in-game podcasts that Peter and Miles can listen to when exploring the games&#39; open world. J. Jonah Jameson&#39;s Just the Facts was introduced in the first game and portrayed Peter Parker&#39;s web-head in a negative light. Danika Hart&#39;s The Danikast, however, contrasted this nicely in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales by complimenting the heroes&#39; actions with Danika even teaming up with Miles Morales at one point.

Both of these podcasts would have short episodes in between major events in the games&#39; campaigns and would discuss what had just unfolded. This was a great way to show how the city would see and react to the heroes and offered some outsider perspectives that weren&#39;t aware of Peter Parker and Miles Morales&#39; personal struggles.

For example, whereas Jameson would take any opportunity to speak ill of the Spider-Men, Danika&#39;s skepticism has weight when she starts discussing Peter&#39;s more aggressive demeanor in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. This is long before the city becomes aware of the symbiotes and their corruptive nature, so showing a former Spider-Man ally grow to fear him is a great way to build upon the campaign&#39;s story about the symbiote&#39;s corruption of Peter, which would otherwise be told through the eyes of those closest to him.




                  “It Can Be Pretty Jarring” - Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Promises A New Spin On The Venom Symbiote   Spider-Man 2 developer, Insomniac Games, has promised a serious and respectful take on the Venom symbiote, resulting in a darker tone for the sequel.    



 With Great Podcasts Comes No Responsibility 
          

Unfortunately, whereas the previous Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games would store all of the podcast episodes under the Collectibles tab in the game&#39;s menu after they&#39;d begun playing, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 doesn&#39;t have such a feature, so podcasts can&#39;t be revisited. The only Collectibles stored are Marko&#39;s Memories, Photo Ops, Mysterium Dev Diaries, and Spider-Bots. It&#39;s unclear why Insomniac opted to exclude the podcasts after they were available to be listened back to in both prior titles.




The major downside to removing this replayability feature is that while the episodes may work better in those moments of the story, they can be cut short if players swing into a crime event in the city. The crime events appear as an easily noticeable red icon in the game, but even if players try to keep their distance, they have a fairly large radius to be triggered. The moment Spider-Man begins to stop a crime, the podcast will close.



Insomniac has confirmed New Game Plus and Mission Replay modes will be added by the end of 2023.




As a result, players may opt to ignore the classic Spider-Man mantra of &#34;with great power, there must also come great responsibility&#34; and turn a blind eye to the criminal activities in their area just to see how an episode of Just the Facts or The Danikast plays out. If not, they won&#39;t be able to hear Danika or Jameson&#39;s commentary until their next playthrough, which could be a whole new game save, or via New Game Plus when that feature is added to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 later this year, unless Insomniac patches podcasts into the Collectibles tab beforehand.
