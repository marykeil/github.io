 10  Let Infected Attack Other Enemies 
Less enemies to kill


Staying quiet, saving bullets, and avoiding confrontation are all key to survival in The Last Of Us 2. One way to do all these things in one go is when the opportunities present themselves to let the Infected and human enemies fight it out. While it only happens in certain areas, they will nearly all wipe each other out, leaving you with a much clearer and quicker path forwards.





 9  Conserve Ammo and Melee Weapons 
With limited ammo available every bit is vital
        

As the game leads itself towards stealth, most areas don&#39;t provide you with lots of ammo at every turn. It is crucial to conserve bullets for tight spots or certain situations against infected enemies when you have no choice but to fire your gun.
This is also the case with melee weapons which can break, but are needed when you are in trouble. The best way to save them both is to only use them when absolutely needed and try other ways to avoid or kill enemies.





 8  Scavenge Everything 
Crafting is key to progressing
        


Right from the start of The Last Of Us 2, there are opportunities to explore, as every area, cupboard or body should be searched for crucial items, manuals, weapons, and ammo. Without these, it would be impossible to get through The Last Of Us 2. It is easy to use the crafting menu quickly and effectively.
Nearly every room you enter will have something to scavenge, so is worth checking every corner. It is also vital you check every enemy after you have eliminated them for weapons and ammo which can&#39;t be found very often. This is especially the case on the hardest difficulty levels in the game when there are much fewer items to be found.





 7  Make The Most of Molotov and Bottles 
The best items at your disposal to provide distractions


In the first game using Molotovs and empty bottles were crucial to surviving and they are once again in The Last Of Us 2. Empty bottles are one of the most common items to find and can be used to lead enemies into a certain position to make it easier to attack them or to clear a path for you.
Molotovs do the same, but can also set enemies on fire, as well as being able to quickly take multiple infected out. Several infected types also get attracted to fires caused by Molotov&#39;s, which can lead to them inadvertently killing themselves.





 6  Take Advantage of Accessibility Options 
Make the game easier for yourself
        

The Last Of Us 2 is one of the most accessible games to date, even years after its initial release. It opens up the doors for a lot of players who previously wouldn&#39;t have been able to play similar games. However, if players want to, several options can be used to make the game easier.
This includes an auto pick-up option, to ensure you never miss items from bodies. An enhanced listening mode, so you can hear more from enemies when they are near. As well as being able to highlight all hidden items in a distinct color, which is a huge help if you are going for 100% completion.





 5  Keep Ingredients Until You Need It 
You can quickly run out of vital crafting elements, so save them up
        

On the lower difficulties, you can find crafting materials regularly as you journey through The Last of Us 2. At vital points of the story however, you can find yourselves urgently needing one type of item, and if you haven&#39;t got any in your bag or the elements required to make one, you can find yourself stuck.
It is best to save your ingredients until you need to craft a certain item, such as a Health Kit or a Molotov. They only take seconds to make, but being able to craft one when needed can be the difference between life and death.





 4  Prioritize Damage and Stability Weapon Upgrades 
Make the right choices when upgrading your weapons
        

The weapons that you find throughout your run through The Last of Us 2 can be upgraded when you find one of the many Workbenches in different locations. While you can upgrade melee weapons, the benches are most useful for upgrading your long guns and pistols.
In total, there are nine different elements that you can upgrade on your chosen gun, but in a single run, you won&#39;t be able to fully upgrade every category on a weapon. It is best to prioritize the damage and stability of your weapons. The further you get into the game, the extra damage is vital, while you will be able to find a lot more headshots once you have improved stability.





 3  Use Supplements Wisely 
The most valuable resource in the game
        


While the majority of items you will find in The Last Of Us 2 are used to craft items you will continually use, you will also find valuable supplements that can boost Ellie&#39;s skills.
Supplements are used to upgrade Ellie&#39;s skill tree.


These will improve Ellie&#39;s abilities permanently, but like your weapons, you will be unable to fully upgrade every category in one play-through. Ellie has four skill trees that can be upgraded, Survival, Crafting, Stealth, and Precision.
While they all offer game-changing upgrades by the end of the skill tree, you should focus on the first one available to you, Precision. It offers vital improvements such as extra health and an improved listen mode. However, it is its final skill Endure, that stands out, offering you a second chance in any scenario where you would normally die, it is the best upgrade you can unlock.





 2  Explore Every Open Area 
Find every item available


 







While the story in The Last Of Us 2 remains a linear one, there are a number of vast open areas to explore. All areas don&#39;t need to be explored to progress the story, but you should take full advantage of every area to avoid missing something that could give you a huge advantage further down the road.
Different areas offer new challenges and can reward you with training manuals, weapons, and vital supplements that can aid you in a variety of ways.







 1  Avoid Combat When Possible 
Stealth is vital


 







While on many occasions in The Last Of Us 2 fighting is inevitable, there are large sections where conflict can be avoided entirely. The stealth elements of the game are fantastic and while Ellie is great in combat, your journey will be much easier if you take advantage of all the tricks at your disposal before going loud.
Using the different items, as well as crawling and learning the different areas can save you in a lot of situations. If you are unsure take your time, learn the enemy patterns, and pick your spot in The Last Of Us 2.
