# Rumored Banjo-Kazooie Game Is The Wrong Rare Revival


## SUMMARY 



  Rumors suggest that a Banjo-Kazooie reboot is in the works, but there is uncertainty about its development and progress.   Another classic Rare game deserves a reboot, but is even less likely to happen than a new Banjo-Kazooie.   Rare, the studio behind both games, has moved on to other projects and many original developers have left, making a revival of these games unlikely.

## Literature Review

Insider info suggests Banjo-Kazooie could be getting a reboot soon, but another classic Rare game is more deserving. Here’s what to know.




Rumor has it a Banjo-Kazooie reboot could be on the way, but there&#39;s another Rare game revival that may never arrive. The first Banjo-Kazooie, released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64, is best described as a 3D collectathon platformer. Players control two characters - Banjo the bear and Kazooie the breegull - as they traipse across eleven worlds, picking up valuable music notes and puzzle pieces to progress. It&#39;s been praised for its innovative gameplay. Banjo and Kazooie each have unique abilities that make tackling certain levels easier, and learn more throughout the game. The game&#39;s charming sense of humor has also contributed to its status as an all-time classic.




Banjo-Kazooie received two mainline sequels: Banjo-Tooie in 2000, and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts for the Xbox 360 in 2008. It also had two handheld spinoffs for the Game Boy Advance, and a spiritual successor in 2017&#39;s Yooka-Laylee. However, the main franchise has been pretty quiet since 2008, despite ever-present rumors of a Banjo-Kazooie revival. Finally, new information shared by industry insiders suggests that the Banjo-Kazooie sequel many have been waiting for is just around the corner - but another classic Rare game deserves its day in the sun, too. Here&#39;s everything to know about the possibility.

 Insiders Say A Banjo-Kazooie Reboot Is An &#34;Active Project&#34; 
But A Brand-New Banjo-Kazooie Could Have A Troubled Development Cycle
          




According to a forum post by a user named Nate Drake, as shared on X (formerly Twitter) by @IdleSloth84_, a new Banjo-Kazooie game is in the works, but its development may be a little more complicated than expected. The forum post goes on to elaborate that the project may have been in the works for much longer, but wasn&#39;t officially greenlit until 2022. It also claims that developers are attempting to incorporate scrapped ideas from previous games, and that development may have been restarted at some point. This was further confirmed in a Quote Tweet by insider @XCloudTimdog, who mentions off-the-record talk of a Banjo-Kazooie reboot several years prior.


 

Between conflicting accounts, the lack of official confirmation, and rumors of development complications, however, it&#39;s difficult to say just what stage the rumored Banjo-Kazooie reboot is at - if it even exists, that is. At this point, it&#39;s a repetitive cycle: new rumors arise every year or so, and run rampant until developers shoot them down, leaving the ultimate decision on Banjo-Kazooie&#39;s future up to Rare. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer refuted similar rumors in 2021, and it probably won&#39;t be long until someone at Rare comes forward to clear the record on the latest batch. But Banjo-Kazooie is far from the only classic Rare game that deserves a reboot.







 The Time Is Right For A New Conker Game 
         

After the success of Banjo-Kazooie and its sequel, Rare followed up with an entirely different kind of game in 2001. Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day was also a 3D platformer released for the N64. It put a little more focus on puzzles than the original Banjo-Kazooie, with a simpler set of platforming abilities and fewer items to collect. It still starred cute, fuzzy animals - except this time, they drank and cursed like sailors. Where Banjo-Kazooie is fit for the whole family, Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day is strictly adults-only. It assumes the player&#39;s familiarity with its contemporary cultural landscape, and attempts to shock them at every turn.

But it&#39;s more than just a gimmick. Conker doesn&#39;t coast on the novelty of its risqué humor. Under all that indecency, there&#39;s actually a better-than-decent game. It may not quite live up to Banjo-Kazooie, but it&#39;s good enough to stand on its own. Unfortunately, Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day didn&#39;t sell too well, in part because the N64 was on its last legs, and would be succeeded by the GameCube later in 2001. Conker&#39;s limited appeal also partially contributed to lower sales numbers.




However, by now, anyone who grew up playing the original Banjo-Kazooie is old enough to appreciate everything Conker was. Conker got even fewer true sequels than Banjo-Kazooie - just an add-on for the game creation platform Project Spark, and Young Conker, which was exclusive to Microsoft&#39;s short-lived HoloLens mixed reality platform. It&#39;d be interesting to see what the franchise could do with modern hardware to run on, and modern pop culture to riff on. However, for a wide variety of reasons, a new Conker game is even less likely than a new Banjo-Kazooie.



 Why Hasn&#39;t There Been A New Banjo-Kazooie Or Conker Game Since 2008? 
Unfortunately, Rare, the studio behind the original Banjo-Kazooie and Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day, isn&#39;t really in a position today to develop a new game in either series. In short, it&#39;s moved onto other projects since its acquisition by Microsoft in 2022: it&#39;s actively developing new seasonal content for its flagship open-world multiplayer pirate game Sea of Thieves, which is still going strong five years after its initial release. Rare is also hard at work on the fantasy adventure game Everwild, which was first announced in 2019, but has yet to set a release date. Its development was apparently rebooted in 2021, so that could still be a ways off.




Furthermore, many of the developers primarily responsible for conceptualizing Banjo-Kazooie and Conker have since moved on from Rare, hence the release of spiritual successor Yooka-Laylee by offshoot studio Playtonic Games. Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day director Chris Seavor left Rare in 2011, and established his own indie development studio, Gory Detail. In short, Rare doesn&#39;t really make platformers like Banjo-Kazooie and Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day anymore. Its more active original IPs, like Battletoads and Killer Instincts, have been outsourced to other development studios in recent years. It&#39;s a completely different development studio from what it once was, and so there&#39;s little hope of revival for some of its older hits.

Whether or not the Banjo-Kazooie reboot is real, the Conker reboot will probably remain little more than a dream. With many classic game developers suddenly taking interest in reviving their old, genre-changing properties, there&#39;s certainly a chance that this Banjo-Kazooie rumor could be true. A new Banjo-Kazooie would be welcome for the nostalgia appeal alone, but a new Conker game would have something truly different to offer.
