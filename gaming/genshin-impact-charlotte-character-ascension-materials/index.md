## Literature Review

Fully Ascending Charlotte and leveling up her Talents in Genshin Impact is the best way to start working on her optimization as a character.





Living up to Charlotte’s gameplay leaks in Genshin Impact, HoYoverse has confirmed that she is a 4-star character that has a Cryo Vision and wields a catalyst in battle. Charlotte is the second hero to have such a combination, following the release of Wriothesley. The Fontainian journalist is at her best when used as a sub-DPS and support character in team comps, as she can provide off-field Cryo damage, as well as healing. Though there are different ways of building her, there is only one way of Ascending Charlotte and leveling her Talents, and that comes through farming the proper materials.





 Materials For Charlotte’s Ascension In Genshin Impact 
         

According to a post on the official Genshin Impact account on X, the first set of materials needed to unlock Charlotte’s leveling process is the Shivada Jade gem family. These items can be gathered primarily from world bosses in Genshin Impact that have some connection to the Cryo element. They can also drop from certain weekly bosses, such as the Lupus Boreas, Dominator of Wolves, and Childe. As the Ascension progresses, versions of increased rarity are demanded for every threshold, so you will need to start using the Crafting Bench to transform Slivers into Fragments, Fragments into Chunks, and Chunks into Gemstones.



Using the Crafting Bench to transform lower-quality materials into higher-quality materials is a vital process, and should be used on all family items that are required in Charlotte’s Ascension.







The next family item to farm for Charlotte is Meshing Gear and its evolved forms, Mechanical Spur Gear and Artificed Dynamic Gear, respectively. These items are regularly dropped by Clockwork Meka opponents scattered all across Fontaine in Genshin Impact. These enemies can be found both above ground and underwater, so it is fairly easy to gather. Like the Shivada Jade family of items, you will need to transform lower-quality pieces into higher-quality ones, using the Crafting Bench, as you progress. This set of Gear items should be farmed in a surplus, as a large sum is also required for Charlotte’s Talents.

The final farmable material needed for Charlotte’s Ascension is Tourbillon Device. This item can only be obtained from the Experimental Field Generator boss encounter and is the same used for Wriothesley’s Ascension in Genshin Impact. In case you obtained the 5-star DPS character, you may have a few Tourbillon Devices lying around. Nevertheless, you will need a grand total of 65 pieces, which means you will need to face the world boss quite a few times. The table below lists all the required materials for Charlotte’s complete Ascension and the respective rewards you can obtain, divided by level threshold:




 Charlotte Ascension Materials &amp; Rewards In Genshin Impact   Level Ascension  Materials  Rewards   Level 20 Ascension    1x Shivada Jade Sliver   3x Meshing Gear   3x Beryl Conch   20,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 40 Ascension    3x Shivada Jade Fragment   15x Meshing Gear   10x Beryl Conch   2x Tourbillon Device   40,000x Mora     -   Level 50 Ascension    6x Shivada Jade Fragment   12x Mechanical Spur Gear   20x Beryl Conch   4x Tourbillon Device   60,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 60 Ascension    3x Shivada Jade Chunk   18x Mechanical Spur Gear   30x Beryl Conch   8x Tourbillon Device   80,000x Mora     -   Level 70 Ascension    6x Shivada Jade Chunk   12x Artificed Dynamic Gear   45x Beryl Conch   12x Tourbillon Device   100,000x Mora       1x Acquaint Fate      Level 80 Ascension    6x Shivada Jade Gemstone   24x Artificed Dynamic Gear   60x Beryl Conch   20x Tourbillon Device   120,000x Mora     -   Total Materials    1x Shivada Jade Sliver   9x Shivada Jade Fragment   9x Shivada Jade Chunk   6x Shivada Jade Gemstone   18x Meshing Gear   30x Mechanical Spur Gear   36x Artificed Dynamic Gear   168x Beryl Conch   46x Tourbillon Device   420,000x Mora       3x Acquaint Fate      



In addition to all the previously mentioned materials, you also need Mora. To get through the level thresholds, you will need 420,000x Mora, plus an extra 1,673,400 to get through the levels themselves. If you need more Mora, you should farm Ley Line Outcrops - Blossoms of Wealth, which can be found across several regions of Teyvat. By completing one, you unlock the next activity in the same region, so you need to simply follow the path. This is costly, but the only way of getting Charlotte to max level in Genshin Impact – bear in mind that leveling her Talents will be the most expensive part of the operation.






 All Of Charlotte’s Talent Materials In Genshin Impact 
          

When dealing with Charlotte’s Talents, players will have to muster up a fair number of Meshing Gear, Mechanical Spur Gear, and Artificed Dynamic Gear. These are the same items used for her Ascension, and this is why farming the surplus is necessary. Much like Furina’s materials in Genshin Impact, you will need to farm the Justice books for Charlotte’s abilities. Teachings, Guides, and Philosophies of Justice can be obtained from the Admonishing Engraving challenge in the Domain of Mastery: Pale Forgotten Glory. This domain is located underwater, northeast of Poisson. The Justice books can be farmed on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

To get Charlotte’s Talents to their max level, you will also need to get a new weekly boss drop allegedly called Lightless Silk String, according to Honey Hunter World. This material drops from the All-Devouring Narwhal boss and is the only one that could not be pre-farmed for Charlotte, as the opponent was added with Version 4.2. Farming the Lightless Silk String in Genshin Impact may take some time, mainly due to the fact that there is a cap on weekly boss challenges. Luckily, not too many are required. The table below lists everything needed to fully level all three of Charlotte’s Talents:




 Charlotte Talent Materials In Genshin Impact   Teachings of Justice    9x      Guide to Justice    63x      Philosophies of Justice    114x      Meshing Gear    18x      Mechanical Spur Gear    66x      Artificed Dynamic Gear    93x      Lightless Silk String    18x      Crown of Insight    3x      Mora    4,957,500x      



Of course, you will also need a fair share of Mora to level her Talents, as well as some Crowns of Insight as you approach her final Talent Levels. If you are not already full of supplies, farming can take a while, which means maxing her out could also take some time. Nevertheless, getting Charlotte to the max level and increasing the power of her Talents is a great way of optimizing the 4-star character in Genshin Impact.
