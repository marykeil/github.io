## Literature Review

Treasure Vaults are scattered across the Highlands of Hogwarts Legacy, and these are a main way by which players will gain extra gear and outfits.





Finding each vault scattered throughout the Hogwarts Legacy map is quite the task but we&#39;ve made it easier by providing each vault location based on region, as well as how to solve the individual puzzles. Completionists should be able to easily identify what they missed by checking the number of vaults completed in each region and comparing it to the lists below.

 How to Solve Treasure Vault Puzzles 
Every Treasure Vault Puzzle Type In Hogwarts Legacy
          

Here is a list of every puzzle type in Hogwarts Legacy that players will encounter while hunting for Treasure Vaults and how to solve them:

 Puzzle Type  Solution   Elemental Cube Puzzle  Use Wingardium Leviosa to bring the cube to the corresponding platform:  Ice (Glacius)   Flame (Incendio/Confringo)   Air (Levioso)      Dive  Swim to the whirlpool and follow prompt   Locked Doors  Use Alohomora Levels I-III to open locks   Blocked Entry  Use Depulso on barrier   Dice Blocks  Use Wingardium Leviosa to move stone dice to an empty slot.   Dancing Cauldrons  Use Confringo to light unlit cauldrons.   Petal Vortex  Chase the petal vortex until it reveals the chest.   Missing Statue  There will be a statue on one pedestal with a lit cauldron, and one with nothing. Use Glacius on the cauldron to douse it. Step on either platform after it switches. This will take the player to the chest.   Pull the Lever!  Use Accio on the handle of a lever to pull it, usually opening a corresponding door. In some cases, multiple levers have to be pulled.   Skeleton Construction  Break the bone piles and use a combination of Accio/Wingardium Leviosa to move piles onto corresponding platforms to build the solution to the puzzle.   Cube Waves  Pick up the cube using Wingardium Leviosa. It will cause the floor to respond.   Simple Archway  Walk through the archway and turn back to reveal the chest.   Chess Puzzle  Bring the randomly generated object to the chess board. Use Transformation to turn it into a chess piece, and place it in the corresponding checkmate position based on the piece it turns into. Note: These puzzles reset if not solved immediately and are not the same every time. General rules of chess movement apply. Put the transformed piece into the right position to capture the King&#39;s open weakness.   Spider Webs  Use Confringo or Incendio to burn the spider webs away   Disappearing Walls  Walk toward the wall sections which can be highlighted by Revelio. The wall will disappear, and one of the disappearing walls is hiding a chest.
