# Alan Wake 2 Isn t A Horror Game, It s A Twin Peaks Game


## SUMMARY 



  Alan Wake 2 draws heavily from Twin Peaks, particularly the third season, The Return, in terms of tone and narrative focus.   Both Twin Peaks and Alan Wake are set in small Washington towns, where dark secrets and inexplicable events disrupt peaceful lives.   Twin Peaks and Alan Wake both feature parallel universes that their protagonists enter but cannot easily leave, and evil doppelgängers that play major roles in the plot.

## Literature Review

Alan Wake 2 borrows a lot from classic horror, but no influence is more prominent than Twin Peaks. Here’s everything the game learns from the series.




Alan Wake 2 wears its influences on its sleeve, and Twin Peaks might be the one it&#39;s proudest of. Twin Peaks, which began airing in 1990, is part gentle soap opera satire, and part surreal murder mystery. But where the first Alan Wake was based on the first two seasons of Twin Peaks, Alan Wake 2 has more in common with the third season, The Return. As a result, it has a somewhat different tone and narrative focus, but one thing that hasn&#39;t changed is just how much it ties back to the seminal series.




Strangely enough, Twin Peaks: The Return and Alan Wake 2 even followed a similar release strategy. Twin Peaks was abruptly canceled after its explosive second season finale in 1991, at which point it went on a 26-year hiatus, only to return in 2017. Similarly, Alan Wake flew under the radar after its initial 2010 release, with only the 2012 spin-off Alan Wake&#39;s American Nightmare and some heavy references in Control&#39;s AWE DLC. Now, 13 years later, there&#39;s a true sequel to the original in Alan Wake 2 - and both the game and the show have taken advantage of their long periods of silence to craft strange, terrifying stories.

                  Alan Wake 2 Ending Explained (In Detail)   Alan Wake 2 ends just as cryptically as it begins. Here’s what happens in the final chapters of the story, and what they mean for a sequel or DLC.    


 Alan Wake 2 And Twin Peaks Have Similar Settings

Both Alan Wake and Twin Peaks are set in small Washington towns, where everyone knows everyone and news travels fast. That makes it all the more devastating when terrible, inexplicable events plague these peaceful hamlets - Laura Palmer&#39;s death in Twin Peaks, and Alan&#39;s disappearance in Alan Wake. Everyone finds out immediately, and the tragedy touches everyone&#39;s life in one way or another. Also, in both season one of Twin Peaks and Alan Wake 2, FBI agents arrive in these small towns, causing the rumor mill to churn as daily small-town life is disrupted by big-government watchfulness.

Alan Wake&#39;s Bright Falls even shares some geographical and infrastructural features with the titular town of Twin Peaks. Each is set against a backdrop of mountain ranges and evergreen forests, and each has a robust logging and fishing industry - although that&#39;s hardly a surprise for Washington state. Both towns have their social hubs in coffee shops with repetitive initials in their names: in Twin Peaks, the Double R Diner, and in Bright Falls, Triple D&#39;s Oh Deer Diner. Both diners pride themselves on their desserts and coffee, with the Oh Deer dishing out cupcakes while the Double R draws crowds for its cherry pie.






 Both Twin Peaks And Alan Wake Feature Dark Parallel Universes 
And Protagonists Who Get Trapped In Them
          

The similarities extend to plot, too: Twin Peaks and Alan Wake both prominently feature dark, alternate dimensions that their protagonists enter willingly but cannot leave. In Alan Wake, that&#39;s the Dark Place. Alan&#39;s wife Alice is drawn into it at the beginning of the first game. Although he soon realizes he can literally write her way out, Alan&#39;s self-doubt causes him to plunge into the Dark Place after her, where he remains for 13 years trying to invent a satisfactory resolution to his novel.

Similarly, at the end of Twin Peaks&#39; second season, Cooper finds a way into the Black Lodge, and enters in pursuit of answers about Laura Palmer&#39;s death and his own mysterious dreams. Once they&#39;re inside, though, they find that leaving these parallel universes is far more difficult than entering. Alan gets stuck in the Dark Place for 13 years, and Cooper in the Black Lodge for 25, which roughly aligns with the time the TV and game series spent on hiatus. And when they finally emerge decades later, both Alan and Cooper discover that their interdimensional journeys have had resounding consequences.






 Both Twin Peaks And Alan Wake Feature Evil Doppelgängers 
And One Who&#39;s Mostly Just Clueless
         

The third season of Twin Peaks and Alan Wake 2 also both have major plot points that revolve around evil doppelgängers who emerge from parallel universes. In the second season finale of Twin Peaks, Cooper seemingly returns from the Black Lodge at the end, and is quickly escorted back to the Great Northern to make his recovery. However, the special agent quickly flies the coop, and speculation about his disappearance runs rampant for the next 25 years.

As it turns out, this isn&#39;t the original Cooper, but Mr. C, a body double created when the real one first entered the Black Lodge. Twin Peaks next checks in with both Coopers at the beginning of season three, when it reveals that Mr. C&#39;s been busy running a criminal enterprise while Cooper lies in wait. Only one of them can exist outside the Black Lodge at a time, and Mr. C has to return before Cooper can leave. However, in order to get around that requirement, Mr. C creates a third Cooper in Dougie Jones.




Alan Wake 2&#39;s doppelgänger plot is a little different, although it starts similarly. When Alan enters the Dark Place, Mr. Scratch appears to take his place. Scratch has slept beneath Cauldron Lake for some time, but because the lake can twist imagination into reality, rumors and tall tales about Alan bring Scratch to life. However, unlike Cooper and his doubles, Alan and Scratch share a corporeal form. Cooper can&#39;t influence Mr. C&#39;s or Dougie&#39;s actions any more than they can influence his, but Alan and Scratch are two personalities inhabiting the same body. That makes it much more impactful when Scratch appears as Alan Wake 2&#39;s final boss.



 Both Twin Peaks And Alan Wake Use Coffee As A Symbol 
A Favorite Drink Of FBI Agents And Writers Everywhere
          

Coffee figures prominently into both Alan Wake and Twin Peaks. However, it&#39;s more than just a little quirk: coffee is used in both works as a symbol of worldly pleasure and human persistence. Good coffee is one of the first things Cooper encounters when he arrives in Twin Peaks, and, after the Douglas firs, it&#39;s the second thing to endear him to the town. He takes solace in this daily ritual, and many pivotal scenes take place over coffee and sweets. It&#39;s no coincidence, then, that one of the first things Cooper notices about the Black Lodge is that the coffee served there is undrinkable, solid black sludge.






The achievement for collecting 25 thermoses in Alan Wake is called &#34;Damn Good Cup of Coffee,&#34; paraphrasing Cooper&#39;s comments on his first cup of Twin Peaks brew.




Similarly, Alan can collect coffee thermoses throughout Bright Falls in the original game, and Saga uses a coffee thermos on her desk as a manual saving point in Alan Wake 2. In both games, coffee serves as a familiar sight in a dark place, a brief moment of reality in a world they no longer understand. The fact that the coffee is in a thermos means that no matter how long it&#39;s been sitting there, it&#39;s still warm, a sign of persistent hope.



 Why There Are So Many Twin Peaks-Inspired Video Games 
Surreal Imagery And Compelling Mystery Make It Ripe For Adaptation
         

Twin Peaks has inspired video games in ways both major and minor. Every detective game to come out since is somehow touched by Twin Peaks influence. Some, like the 2001 PlayStation game Mizzurna Falls, are more direct unofficial adaptations, with sudden disappearances and surreal happenings. Mizzurna Falls and Deadly Premonition also attempt to bring the small-town feel of Twin Peaks to an interactive format; each has a diverse cast of unique townspeople, each of whom has their own daily schedule. Players must also manage survival aspects by keeping their cars gassed up and their stomachs full.




Other games simply borrow from the esoteric detective style embodied by Agent Cooper. Titles like Disco Elysium, which is now available on PS Plus Extra, allow players to deduce based not only on clues and reason, but on instinct and spirituality. Others, like the direct adaptation Twin Peaks VR, focus more on creating surreal imagery. Video games do the surreal better than most media; total control over modeling, rendering and effects lets developers create some truly bizarre sights.

This is especially prominent in Alan Wake 2, which features realities flickering in and out, unusual audio and video cues, and doors that lead to places they shouldn&#39;t. Where Twin Peaks puts the audience into the Black Lodge through its surrogate character Cooper, the interactive elements of games like Alan Wake 2 put players in direct control of characters exploring dark, unreal dimensions.

The influence of Twin Peaks on horror, mystery, and surrealism is undeniable, but it&#39;s especially noticeable in Alan Wake. Either one serves as an excellent introduction to the kind of storytelling employed by the other, but they&#39;re best experienced in tandem. Knowledge of Twin Peaks can help players make sense of Alan Wake&#39;s convoluted story, and a familiarity with its influences on Alan Wake 2 makes Twin Peaks that much more interesting.
