For the King 2 offers twelve unique character classes you can play as, but seven of these archetypes are only unlocked at certain points in the story.





You initially have five character types you may choose from in For the King 2, similar to the four basic character classes seen in Minecraft&#39;s D&amp;D DLC. Likely inspired by classic TTRPG roots, each starting archetype teaches you the basic mechanics of the game through an easy-to-understand class. As you progress, more complicated warriors, spell casters, and unorthodox origins will start appearing as you meet various objectives.
