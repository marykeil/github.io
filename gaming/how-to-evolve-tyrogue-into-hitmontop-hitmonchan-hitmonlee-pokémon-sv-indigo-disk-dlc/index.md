## Literature Review

Tyrogue has three different evolutions in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, and which one you get depends on your Pokémon&#39;s stats.





However, when it comes to Tyrogue&#39;s evolutions, things can get a little complicated. If you want to get a specific version of its evolution, you&#39;ll need a Tyrogue with the appropriate stats. This may appear troubling at first, but it&#39;s a far easier process than evolving some of the other Pokémon in the game, such as how to evolve Milcery into Alcremie.




                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk: How To Get Briar&#39;s Book Secret Cutscene   Briar&#39;s Book is an item that players will receive after completing the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, but it has more use than it seems.   


 How To Evolve Tyrogue Into Hitmontop, Hitmonchan &amp; Hitmonlee 
          

Tyrogue will evolve into one of its three evolutions once it reaches level 20. The type of Pokémon it evolves into is determined by your Tyrogue&#39;s Attack and Defense stats when it reaches level 20.

  If its attack is higher than its defense, Tyrogue will evolve into Hitmonlee.   If its defense is higher than its attack, Tyrogue will evolve into Hitmonchan.   If its attack and defense are equal, Tyrogue will evolve into Hitmontop.  

If your Tyrogue lacks the necessary stats to achieve your desired evolution, you can always feed it items to alter its stats. Some of the best in this case are:




  Adamant Mints - Increases attack, decreases special attack   Relaxed Mints - Increases defense, decreases speed   Muscle Feathers - Increases attack   Resist Feathers - Increases defense  



 Where To Find Tyrogue In Indigo Disk DLC 
          

Tyrogue can be found throughout the Canyon Biome. There&#39;s even a chance you&#39;ll run into a Hitmontop, Hitmonchan, or Hitmonlee while exploring the caves. Overall, you can&#39;t walk through this area without coming across a Tyrogue. As a result, it should just be a matter of time before you catch a Tyrogue and obtain all of its evolutions in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC.
