# Why Marvel s Blade May Not Be An Xbox Exclusive After All


## SUMMARY 



  Microsoft-owned studio, Arkane Lyon&#39;s new game, Marvel&#39;s Blade, has the potential to counter PlayStation&#39;s exclusive Marvel titles as an Xbox-exclusive.   The reveal trailer for Marvel&#39;s Blade at The Game Awards 2023 didn&#39;t provide details on the game&#39;s release date or platforms, leaving fans speculating.   While Bethesda declined to comment on Blade&#39;s potential exclusivity, it is likely to be an Xbox exclusive considering it is developed by a studio owned by Microsoft.

## Literature Review

Blade is being developed by the Microsoft-owned Arkane Lyon, and will likely be an Xbox exclusive, but there is speculation this may not be the case.




Upon its reveal, many thought that Marvel&#39;s Blade could be an Xbox exclusive. The title is being developed by Bethesda subsidiary Arkane Lyon after Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda&#39;s owner, ZeniMax Media. This would certainly be a way for Microsoft to counter Insomniac Games&#39; PlayStation-exclusive Marvel titles, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#39;s Wolverine. Despite this, there seems to be some speculation surrounding the matter.




The trailer for Marvel&#39;s Blade was revealed at The Game Awards 2023 but didn&#39;t give too much away about the game&#39;s story other than its location and first glimpse at its protagonist, showing the Daywalker at a barber shop in Paris before being called into action and preparing his sword. The M-rated, third-person action-adventure title will take place during what appears to be a vampire apocalypse in France, with an alert sounding as night falls and humans are encouraged to take shelter.

                  Is Marvel&#39;s Blade Set In The Same Universe As Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man &amp; Wolverine?   Marvel&#39;s Blade is the perfect follow-up to Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#39;s Wolverine — that is if the game is actually a follow-up at all.   


 Blade&#39;s Platforms Weren&#39;t Announced At TGA 
The First Trailer Simply Announced The Game
         

While the trailer confirmed who the developers behind Marvel&#39;s Blade were and offered some insight into its story, it left out some key information: a release date and what platforms it will be on. The following interview with Arkane Lyon&#39;s co-creative director Dinga Bakaba and Marvel Games&#39; vice president and creative director Bill Rosemann also didn&#39;t provide this information and elaborated on the core concept behind Marvel&#39;s Blade instead.




Normally, exclusive titles are billed as such from the offset in a bumper at either the beginning or end of the trailer with Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s E3 2016 reveal clearly stating that it was &#34;In development for the PlayStation 4 system&#34; at the end, and Insomniac&#39;s later Marvel titles, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and Marvel&#39;s Wolverine were all announced during PlayStation State of Plays or PlayStation Showcases with accompanying posts on the PlayStation Blog to confirm their platforms.

Microsoft has done this before with its exclusive titles, with Bethesda&#39;s Starfield displaying its Xbox and PC exclusivity prominently throughout its marketing. Because Marvel&#39;s Blade did not take such an approach and wasn&#39;t announced as part of an Xbox Showcase, many have been speculating that Marvel&#39;s Blade may not be an Xbox exclusive after all, with the title card simply saying that the game is &#34;Now in development&#34;.






Another notable Xbox exclusive shown at The Game Awards 2023, Hideo Kojima&#39;s OD, clearly displayed Xbox branding as part of its reveal trailer.




                  Every Upcoming Marvel Game Currently In Development (2024)   Including the imminent arrival of Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, Marvel gaming fans can look forward to multiple titles hitting shelves in the coming years.   



 Bethesda Won&#39;t Comment On Blade&#39;s Xbox Exclusivity 
But Disney Says It&#39;s Bethesda&#39;s Decision
          

With other Bethesda titles, such as the aforementioned Starfield or Arkane Austin’s fellow vampire title, Redfall, the studio has issued stories on Bethesda.net to accompany their reveals. In the case of Redfall, this 2021 post contained multiple mentions that the game was an Xbox Series X/S and PC exclusive and that it would also be coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, which was unsurprising as this reveal came after Microsoft acquired the studio earlier that year.




Bethesda did share a story regarding Marvel&#39;s Blade on Bethesda.net, however, it contained none of these details and instead repeated Rosemann and Bakaba&#39;s statements about the game from The Game Awards. Because of the distinct difference in press releases surrounding the title, VG247 reached out to Bethesda to inquire about any potential Xbox console exclusivity, but stated that &#34;the company declined to comment&#34;.

Axios&#39;s Stephen Totilo interviewed Marvel&#39;s owner, Disney&#39;s head of gaming, Sean Shoptaw, and claimed on X that the two had discussed Xbox exclusivity for Marvel&#39;s Blade following its announcement. In the interview, Shoptaw talked openly about how Microsoft requested the upcoming Indiana Jones game to be an Xbox and PC exclusive and how Disney felt it &#34;wasn&#39;t going to be overly exclusionary&#34; in doing so due to &#34;Xbox still being one of the bigger marketplaces for games&#34;. In their follow-up, Shoptaw claimed that the decision to make Marvel&#39;s Blade an exclusive title is up to Bethesda, however.





 

XboxEra&#39;s co-founder, Nick &#34;Shpeshal Nick&#34; Baker, also took to X to respond to a Forbes article surrounding the exclusivity confusion titled No One Seems To Know If Arkane’s ‘Blade’ Game Is Xbox Exclusive and simply stated, &#34;I do. It is.&#34; While Baker didn&#39;t reveal his sources, he was one of the first leakers for Marvel&#39;s Blade before its official announcement at The Game Awards, which does give his statement more credibility.


 

                  Xbox Exclusive Marvel Games Microsoft Totally Wasted   Marvel Games proposed a partnership with Xbox before making Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man with PlayStation and Sony, but Microsoft didn&#39;t go for the deal.   






 Blade May Not Even Be Coming To Current-Gen Consoles 
Could Blade Be A Next-Gen Title?
          

Between Bethesda&#39;s refusal to commit to any target platforms and Disney clarification on the matter, it is plausible that Marvel&#39;s Blade may not even be coming to current-gen consoles. The Xbox Series S/X launched in late 2020, and console generations tend to last around six or seven years on average - with a mid-generation refresh like the leaked all-digital Xbox Series X&#39;s &#34;Brooklin&#34; - and the average AAA development cycle appears to be around five years long.

The fact that Marvel&#39;s Blade&#39;s reveal included a &#34;now in development&#34; tagline with no mention of specific platforms could indicate that Marvel&#39;s Blade is in the early stages of development. This would make it possible that the title could miss the current console generation altogether, and that the secrecy surrounding its release could be due to its intended platform not being announced yet.




It is highly likely that Marvel&#39;s Blade will be an Xbox and PC exclusive considering it&#39;s being made by a studio owned by Microsoft, and Xbox CEO Phil Spencer previously declared that all ZeniMax games would be Xbox exclusives in a November 2021 meeting going forward, as revealed during a court hearing for the Microsoft v Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proceedings. With this information being publicly revealed in June 2023, it is surprising that Bethesda wouldn&#39;t confirm Marvel&#39;s Blade&#39;s Xbox exclusivity as part of its reveal, especially with Microsoft likely wanting to use the title as Xbox&#39;s answer to Insomniac&#39;s growing Marvel Universe on PlayStation.
