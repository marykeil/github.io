Despite its simplicity, there is always a chance that you could get stuck on any given Wordle. One of the best strategies is to use a consistent starting word. Using the same word to begin a game each day helps the player learn how to react based on the initial hints given. Many players even find that a two-word combo is the best way to begin a game and cover as many letters as possible right off the bat.

The November 20th Wordle answer is CANDY.

We didn&#39;t have that much trouble with today&#39;s answer as it&#39;s a fairly common word. For our starting Wordle word today we used POUND which provided two misplaced letters, &#39;N&#39; and &#39;D&#39;.

Mixing them around a bit we tried DINER as our second guess locking in the &#39;N&#39; and providing a few more incorrect letters. This quickly led to our Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, CANDY.
