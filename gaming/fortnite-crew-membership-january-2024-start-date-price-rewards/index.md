## Literature Review

2024&#39;s first Fortnite Crew Pack features the exclusive Silas Hesk Outfit and additional perks including premium Battle Pass access and extra V-Bucks.





The price of a Fortnite Crew subscription hasn’t changed since last month’s Crew Pack was released, so you can sign up via the in-game Item Shop for $11.99 (£9.99, €9.99) a month. January 2024’s Fortnite Crew Pack will be available for subscribers to claim from now until 7PM EST on January 31st, at which point a new Crew Pack will be rotated in. However, once you’ve claimed your rewards, they’re yours to keep forever.

Via the official Fortnite website, Silas Hesk is the featured Character Outfit for this month’s Crew Pack. The Silas Hesk Outfit also comes with The Serpentine Back Bling and Fangs of Hesk Pickaxe, completing a full set of character cosmetics.

         

Subscribers will also receive Crew Legacy Styles for Silas Hesk once they’ve claimed the Outfit, and stay subscribed for additional months. Fortnite Crew Legacy Styles are a relatively new addition to the Crew Packs, but they essentially reward subscribers with new looks for their characters, as long as they stay subscribed for longer than a month.






The Serpentine Back Bling and Fangs of Hesk also feature Crew Legacy Styles.




          

Finally, after the launch of LEGO Fortnite last month, players will also receive Silas Hesk in LEGO minifigure form – perfect for building rocket ships and battling bosses in LEGO Fortnite.

Although exclusive cosmetics are always a nice benefit to have, subscribers also receive additional perks that are arguably more valuable. These include:




  Access to the premium track of the current Fortnite Battle Pass.   1,000 V-Bucks to spend in the Fortnite Item Shop.   Rocket Pass Premium for Rocket League.  

The Fortnite Battle Pass contains dozens of rewards, including seasonal cosmetics and extra packs of V-Bucks. These rewards are cosmetic-only, so you’ll still need quick reflexes and some good landing spots to earn Victory Crowns. 1,000 V-Bucks is a particularly nice perk, as many of Fortnite’s best Outfits only appear in the Item Shop. Fortnite frequently features crossovers with other media, so it’s a good idea to save up V-Bucks ahead of time.

          

Rocket Pass Premium is essentially the premium battle pass for Psyonix’s high-octane car soccer game. It’s a great perk if you already enjoy Rocket League, and encourages you to try out a few matches if you haven’t already.




Overall, the January 2024 Fortnite Crew Pack has lots to offer. However, it’s ultimately for you to decide whether to subscribe. Dedicated players who regularly play Fortnite are likely to benefit the most; more casual fans might not be able to take advantage of everything the Crew Pack has to offer.
