## Literature Review

Schematics in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies let you craft power-ups and other items before your deployment, but these blueprints can be hard to unlock.





There are four categories of Schematics tied to Wonder Weapons, Perk-A-Cola flavors, Ammo Mods, and Aetherium items. Tools from any of these sections are unlocked when you find them on the map, usually from Rift Rewards at the end of various contracts. You can acquire individual instances of items, such as a specific can of Perk-A-Cola in MW3 Zombies, but these do not let you craft anything after you Exfil.

 How To Find All Schematics in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

You can find every Schematic by earning rewards from high-tier contracts, looting caches and chests in dangerous zones, and completing Cargo Delivery missions. Some blueprints, like the Quick Revive recipe in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, are specifically earned from one type of contract, while others are found randomly. Tougher contracts lead to better rewards, with Schematics being a common gift for difficult assignments.

Areas with a higher threat level of zombies also have better loot from chests and other containers that you or your squad discover. There are nine Perk-A-Cola types, five different Ammo Mods, and five Aetherium items whose Schematics could be found in any of these caches. You may also uncover the plans for making the Ray Gun or Wunderwaffe DG-2 weapon in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies as well.






Perk-A-Cola Schematics are given as a guaranteed reward from certain Contract missions, so looting chests will likely grant you a different type of blueprint unless you get very lucky.




An easy way to farm Schematics is to accept Cargo Deliveries, a unique type of Contract that has you fight zombies as you try to take an item from one place to another. These fast but extremely dangerous missions typically occur in Urzikstan red zones in MW3 Zombies. However, the added risk from these contracts makes the final Rift Reward contain rarer items, with a higher chance of dropping a blueprint.

Continuing to do Cargo Delivery quests will eventually allow you to unlock every Schematic in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. However, the random nature of these items will cause some to get these blueprints faster than others.
