## Literature Review

1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton’s relationship status has changed six months after the unexpected death of her husband, Caleb Willingham.




1000-Lb Sisters cast member Tammy Slaton updated her TikTok bio, implying that she is part of the LGBTQIA&#43; community. The 37-year-old Dixon resident joined rehab and began a relationship with a fellow male patient, Caleb Willingham. Her new relationship started on a great note, and things moved on quite swiftly. Tammy fell in love with Caleb and married him shortly after. The couple celebrated various milestones in the early phase but eventually parted ways after Tammy successfully completed her rehab. Unfortunately, Caleb passed away on June 30, 2023, due to health complications.




Tammy has been single since Caleb’s unexpected death. However, she recently sparked relationship rumors by posting a cryptic update. In January 2024, Tammy changed her TikTok bio to include the pride flag. Not only that, but she used two green hearts and a rainbow emoji and confidently shared that she is “happily taken.” The 1000-Lb Sisters star also posted a few interesting TikTok clips of her lip-syncing to some romantic songs. She captioned those videos with pride flag emojis. A few of her latest posts also have the trans flag in them.

Tammy’s latest relationship update and bio change don’t reveal a lot. However, she may have started dating a nonbinary TikToker, Justice Faith. Over the last few weeks, Tammy has shared several duets with Justice on her TikTok. One of her videos shows her singing the song “Young Dumb &amp; Broke” by Khalid. She sings the chorus, “You’re still thinking of me just like I know you should I cannot give you everything, You know I wish I could.” Tammy herself hasn’t revealed if she’s dating the TikToker. However, her actions have suggested that she might be with them. Justice also claimed to be “taken” in their bio.

It’s great to see that Tammy has moved on from her loss. The reality TV star was very much in love with Caleb and really cared for him. When she moved out of the rehab, she was worried about Caleb’s health and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, her worst fear came true when Caleb passed away unexpectedly. Now Tammy has claimed she’s with someone else. She has moved on to find a new partner, which is great for her mental health. Tammy needs someone supportive who can help her on her journey of getting fit. She can use someone like Justice, who has lost over 400 pounds over the years.




While she hasn’t specifically said she&#39;s part of the LGBTQ&#43; community, her posts and bio update show that she might be choosing to live her truth now. If so, it’s praiseworthy that she has confidently embraced this side of her. She didn’t try to hide anything from her followers. Instead, she proudly showed off the Pride flag on her social media profile and has revealed she is taken. Hopefully, the 1000-Lb Sisters cast member’s new relationship will play out better than her last one.
