## Literature Review

Becoming a Fashion Designer is one of the most desirable occupations in Bitlife, but as with all other careers, you&#39;ll have to work hard to get it.





Fortunately, unlike becoming an Astronaut in BitLife, you do not need to purchase any extra packs to pursue this career. Furthermore, you don&#39;t have to go as far as getting a STEM degree, either. Therefore, becoming a Graphic Designer is a bit easier than some other game careers. That being said, just like becoming a Lawyer, you will still need to follow a specific life path and take certain steps to make it happen.

 How To Be a Fashion Designer In Bitlife 
          

Before you begin chasing your dream of becoming a Fashion Designer in BitLife, remember that it is best to pursue this career with a character with high Smarts stats. While it is not required, it improves your chances of success throughout your education. So, if you&#39;re starting a new character, keep re-rolling until you get high Smarts. If you&#39;ve already started a new life, you can boost your Smarts stats by regularly visiting the library and ensuring you &#34;study harder&#34; at school.

Once you&#39;ve graduated high school in BitLife, go to the Occupation tab, and under Education, apply to university for a major in Graphic Design. After you graduate from university, you will want to check the Full-time job listings in the Occupation tab for the Jr. Fashion Designer role. This is your ticket to a career in Fashion Design; all you have to do now is get the job. However, that is easier said than done because you must answer all the interview questions correctly to be hired.






If the Jr. Fashion Designer job listing does not appear, you may need to age a few years or restart the app until it appears as an option.




Once you&#39;ve landed the job, ensure you&#39;re always &#34;working hard&#34; to get promotions. Your first promotion will be to a regular Fashion Designer, then after that, a Sr. Fashion Designer. However, you&#39;ll need to put in much time and effort to become a Sr. Fashion Designer in BitLife.
