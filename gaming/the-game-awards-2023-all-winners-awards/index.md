 Baldur’s Gate 3 Is The Game Of The Year (GOTY) At TGA 2023 
          

The big winner of the night was Baldur’s Gate 3, Larian Studios’ highly acclaimed RPG. The title was already one of the strongest contenders for the GOTY award and lived up to receiving the proof of its accomplishments. Baldur’s Gate 3 left a mark in the gaming industry and even helped initiate a polemic debate about whether it is a new standard for RPG games or not.

The high quality in animation, artistic design, and soundtrack all stack up with its well-rounded turn-based combat, the extensive and deep branching narrative moved by the player’s freedom of choice, and outstanding performances by the voice actors. The GOTY award given to Baldur’s Gate 3 at The Game Awards highlights the game’s merits, both at launch, and with its post-content patches that added more content, fixed most issues so far, and much more.
