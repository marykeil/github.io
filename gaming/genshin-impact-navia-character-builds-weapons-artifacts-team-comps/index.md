## Literature Review

You can increase Navia’s value as a DPS unit in Genshin Impact with the best build and ideal team comp to accompany her on-field Geo presence.





Navia is a Geo main DPS unit who specializes in triggering Crystallize reactions and then enhancing her powers by gathering Crystal Shrapnel charges, created by the very Crystallize reactions she triggers. Her Elemental Skill is the most important part of her kit, as it is the one that allows her to use Geo more often and deal more damage. This was first uncovered in Navia’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact but later confirmed by her official reveal in the Version 4.3 livestream, which showcased how she operates on the field. Taking this into consideration is necessary when building her as a DPS and selecting characters for her team comp.





 Best Weapons For Navia 
          

The first step to optimize Navia in Genshin Impact is to give her a weapon. The best one is her signature 5-star claymore, Verdict. The axe-shaped claymore has a staggering base ATK stat (674.33 at level 90, via Honey Hunter World), and is accompanied by a useful CRIT Rate sub-stat (22.05% at level 90). What makes it perfect for Navia however, is its weapon skill. Verdict increases Navia’s ATK by 20% and, whenever any party member grabs an Elemental Shard created by Crystallize, the user gains 1 Seal, which increases Elemental Skill DMG by 18%. Each Seal disappears after 15 seconds and up to two can be held at once.

Considering how often Crystallize should occur with Navia on the team, Verdict fits her gameplay very well. Alternatively, you can use other 5-star claymores. As recommended by Game8, Navia’s best substitute weapon is The Unforged. The weapon has good stats, with ATK (49.6% at level 90) as its sub-stat, but also increases Shield Strength by 20% via its skill in Genshin Impact. The weapon’s ability also increases Navia’s ATK by 4% for 8 seconds when she hits enemies, an effect that can be stacked up to five times and can occur once every 0.3 seconds. The weapon skill’s ATK buff is increased by 100% when the user has a shield.




In case you do not have a 5-star weapon to spare, there are 4-star alternatives for Navia. The first option is the battle pass-exclusive claymore, Serpent Spine. This weapon offers CRIT Rate (27.1% at level 90) as its sub-stat, which comes in handy with Navia’s DPS build. The weapon also grants more DMG output and input the longer the character is on the field – seeing how Navia is an on-field DPS, this should work well. The fact that she should be shielded is also great, as it means the DMG input debuff should not be applied to her HP in Genshin Impact.

The table below lists the best builds for Navia, including the best weapons, Artifact sets, stats, and more:

 Navia&#39;s Best Build In Genshin Impact   Weapon    Verdict (Best 5-star)   The Unforged (Substitute 5-star)   Serpent Spine (Best 4-star)   Tidal Shadow (F2P 4-star)      Artifact    Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods (4 pieces)   Archaic Petra (2 pieces) and Gladiator&#39;s Finale (2 pieces) - temporary      Stat Priority    ATK   CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate   Geo DMG   Elemental Mastery (optional)      Skill Priority    Elemental Skill   Normal Attack   Elemental Burst      






Of course, considering all the aforementioned weapons are obtained through premium experiences, you can equip F2P (free-to-play) weapons on Navia. The best F2P claymore for Navia is Tidal Shadow. The 4-star claymore can be crafted after acquiring its recipe in Fontaine. It has ATK (41.3% at level 90) as a sub-stat and, even though its weapon skill increases ATK when the user is healed – which should not occur so often considering how well shielded Navia should be – it is a great option to employ for its stats alone.



 Best Team Comps For Navia 
         

Unlike a few characters in the category, Navia is a very independent DPS unit and does not require much assistance in team comps. Of course, any way of amplifying her damage is welcome, but she is not too demanding – Wanderer in Genshin Impact, for instance, requires parties with varied elements that interact with Anemo to trigger Swirl and increase his damage output. Navia only requires a unit that interacts with Geo so as to trigger Crystallize and generate Elemental Shards so that she can keep on dealing damage.




It is recommended to pair her up with at least one off-field sub-DPS, like Raiden Shogun or Yelan, and one additional Geo unit, like Albedo, Zhongli, or Yun Jin to trigger Geo Resonance (which increases Shield Strength and boosts DMG dealt when protected by a shield). Even though she is often protected by shields obtained from Elemental Shards, it is recommended that Navia has a healer in her team comp in Genshin Impact, capable of healing party members when things get too complicated. The table below lists a few team comp suggestions, though the characters are highly customizable:

 Navia&#39;s Best Team Comps In Genshin Impact   Standard Team Comp    Navia (Main DPS)   Yelan, Furina, or Raiden Shogun (Off-field sub-DPS)   Albedo or Zhongli (Geo Resonance &amp; sub-DPS)   Kokomi, Bennett, or Barbara (Healer)      F2P Team Comp    Navia (Main DPS)   Xingqiu, Xiangling, or Fischl (Off-field sub-DPS)   Yun Jin (Geo Resonance &amp; support)   Bennett or Barbara (Healer)      





You must select characters with elements that interact with Geo. As such, Anemo and Dendro characters are not too recommended in a party with Navia.









 Best Artifacts, Stats, &amp; Skill Priority For Navia 
          

The rest of Navia’s build is quite straightforward and in line with that which is expected from a standard main DPS unit. The best Artifact set for Navia is Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods. With two pieces, the gear grants an 18% bonus to ATK, as registered by Game8. With four pieces, the Artifact set sees that, after using an Elemental Skill, the user gains a 20% Geo DMG bonus for 10 seconds and, while they have a Crystallize-based shield, the effect will be increased by 150%, a bonus that disappears 1 second after the shield is lost. This fits Navia’s kit in Genshin Impact perfectly.

Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods rewards players for using their Elemental Skill with more Geo DMG output, and then intensifies this very bonus when they have a shield, which is right up Navia’s alley. A temporary alternative to this is using two pieces from the Archaic Petra set and two pieces from Gladiator’s Finale. The former will grant a 20% Geo DMG Bonus, while the latter increases ATK by 18%. It is a good combination, but not as good as the complete Nighttime Whispers Artifact set.

When farming Artifacts for Navia, the stats you want to look out for are those used by DPS units, which maximize the DMG output potential. This includes ATK, a healthy 2:1 CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate distribution, and Geo DMG. A bit of Elemental Mastery can also come in handy, but it is not as important as the previously mentioned stats in Genshin Impact.



Reaching the golden ratio for CRIT can be facilitated when using weapons that have either CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG as their sub-stat.




When leveling up Navia’s Talents, you will need to prioritize her Elemental Skill, which is the main source of her damage. Following that, you should upgrade her Normal Attack, which will allow her to maximize her potential while she is on the field slamming opponents. Lastly, her Elemental Burst should be upgraded. This deals a ton of damage, but considering how long it can take to be fueled and how much less it is used in comparison to Navia’s other Talents, it should come in last. Ultimately, the process of building Navia in Genshin Impact is quite simple as she is a standard issue DPS unit.
