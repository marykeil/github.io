# Marvels Spider-Man 2 DLC s Most Obvious Villain Is Already A Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;The Flame&#34; arc introduces the classic Marvel villain Carnage in his non-symbiote form, setting up a potential DLC storyline.   The game&#39;s &#34;T-for-Teen&#34; rating may limit the amount of violence that can be shown, which could pose a challenge when portraying the more violent and dangerous Carnage.   A Venom spin-off game by Insomniac Games could provide the opportunity to have an M-rated Carnage as one of the primary villains, allowing for a more brutal and threatening portrayal.

## Literature Review

Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;The Flame&#34; arc sets up a classic villain who could return in a story DLC, but would the game&#39;s T rating do the character justice?




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;The Flame&#34; arc sets up a classic Marvel villain who could return in a story DLC. These side missions show Yuri Watanabe&#39;s vigilante alter-ego Wraith and Peter Parker&#39;s Spider-Man tracking down and investigating a sadistic cult terrorizing New York City.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2]

At the end of this arc, the cult&#39;s leader is revealed to be Cletus Kasady, who Spider-Man fans will know better as Carnage. Although Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 introduces Kasady in his non-symbiote form, his &#34;prophecy&#34; shows a ritual to become a red monster as part of an event called &#34;Crimson Dawn.&#34; To achieve this, The Flame acquires one of Oscorp&#39;s symbiote, and Kasady escapes with it by the end of this arc, announcing that &#34;there will be carnage&#34; and setting up the iconic Spider-Man villain for a potential DLC storyline that could tie up the Insomniac Marvel Universe&#39;s symbiote arc.

                  10 Things A Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC Must Include   Spider-Man 2&#39;s story has been praised and tells a mostly complete narrative, but it does leave some loose ends, which it could tie up in story DLC.   


 Would Carnage Require An M-Rating? 
Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Is Rated T
         




As exciting as the prospect of having such a fan-favorite villain in Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe may be, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 isn’t rated &#34;M-for-Mature&#34;, so there’s only so much violence these titles are allowed to show, which doesn’t bode well for a character such as Carnage. The game&#39;s &#34;T-for-Teen&#34; rating worked fine for Venom since there’s only one truly graphic scene in which he bites Kraven&#39;s head off at the end of their fight. However, at this moment, the camera cuts away from the violence and lingers on the image of Kraven&#39;s animal tooth necklace in a pool of blood in the rain to make the brutality of this moment sink in without showing much of the violence.

The whole point of Carnage is that he is more violent and dangerous, showing a remorseless serial killer bonding completely with the symbiote to become a threat so great that Spider-Man and Venom often have to team up to take him on. The character has appeared in other Spider-Man games, such as Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage, Spider-Man (2000), and The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#39;s movie tie-in, with a different version of the character appearing in Ultimate Spider-Man. However, most of these games were rated PG or T, and with the exception of Maximum Carnage - which could get away with recreating the comics through 16-bit graphics - the character has only appeared briefly for a level or boss fight.






The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had Cletus Kasady murdering other criminals before becoming Carnage for the final boss battle, but Spider-Man would only visit Kasady&#39;s crime scenes, which were toned down for the game&#39;s T rating.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, however, has more realistic visuals for its character models, and if a DLC were to follow Kasady&#39;s transformation into Carnage it would spend a lot more time with the character than the aforementioned titles. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man&#39;s The City That Never Sleeps DLC campaign lasted approximately 6 hours, which is longer than the side mission arcs in each game and would provide more time to flesh out Carnage&#39;s story. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;The Flame&#34; alluded to Kasady&#39;s sadistic side, but used fire and branding rather than bladed weapons. As Insomniac&#39;s take on the symbiote is immune to fire, this could be a way to continue showing how violent the character is without showing blood to retain its T rating.




                  Most Shocking Deaths In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   From classic Spider-Man characters to beloved NPCs, Spider-Man 2&#39;s story features far more shocking deaths than the series&#39; previous two games.   



 Other Adaptations Have Been Criticized For Toning Down Carnage 
Let There Be Carnage Had A PG-13 Rated Carnage
          

In the lead-up to the Venom movie&#39;s release in 2018, there was speculation that Tom Hardy&#39;s depiction would be for more mature audiences, with Venom biting an enemy&#39;s head off - much as the character does to Kraven in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 - in early San Diego Comic-Con footage for the film. However, despite being a more violent take than the character&#39;s previous live-action depiction in 2007&#39;s Spider-Man 3 with far darker humor, the film was released with a PG-13 rating.



Fans who saw the Venom SDCC footage reported that the head-biting scene was initially more violent, but was cut down in the finished film. Despite this, the film&#39;s director, Ruben Fleischer, stated that the film was always intended to be PG-13 in an interview with Polygon.







Despite this, many fans hoped that the introduction of Cletus Kasady - who was teased in Venom&#39;s post-credit scene - would be enough to convince Sony Pictures to go for an R-rating in its 2021 sequel Venom: Let There Be Carnage, especially with the great critical and financial success of other R-rated comic book movies at the time such as Deadpool and Joker. Unfortunately, Venom: Let There Be Carnage also received a PG-13 rating and faced criticism for how Carnage was clearly toned down as a character to meet the criteria for it.

Kasady&#39;s backstory in Venom: Let There Be Carnage still depicted him murdering his mother, grandmother, and dog and ultimately becoming a serial killer, but this was done in an animation in the style of a child&#39;s drawings - which did add some creepiness to the sequence - to avoid showing too much violence. Upon bonding with the symbiote in the comics, Kasady is often depicted slaughtering his enemies with a variety of symbiotic weapons like axes, maces, and spears, but while the movie version did have these at some point, he didn&#39;t use them except for in the final showdown with Venom, and when he killed humans in a prison escape scene it was via becoming a tornado or other tactics designed to obscure the character&#39;s antics from the audience.






 Would A Venom Game Be A Better Fit For Carnage? 
Venom Is Already More Violent In Insomniac&#39;s Combat
          

While it&#39;s unlikely to happen in a Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man title, Insomniac Games has already announced M-rated titles within its Marvel Universe with Marvel&#39;s Wolverine being the first. In an interview with Insider, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s Senior Narrative Director, Jon Paquette was asked about the possibility of the studio making a Venom spin-off game. While the ending of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 showed the Venom symbiote removed from Harry Osborn and seemingly destroyed, Paquette said the studio was waiting to see how the fans react to its take on Venom, and then listen to what the fans want.



There was already a brief section in which Venom became playable in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, which could be a starting point for a full Venom title&#39;s gameplay.







If the studio were to bring back Venom somehow for his own spin-off game this could be an opportunity to have an M-rated Carnage as one of the primary villains. If players are in control of Venom throughout, it&#39;s likely that the combat would be more violent in nature, which could demand an M-rating anyway. Without that rating concern, the studio could show Carnage in his most brutal form, setting him up to be an even greater threat than Venom.

Unfortunately, this would likely cut Wraith&#39;s story short, as Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s &#34;The Flame&#34; arc ended with the police-captain-turned-vigilante and Peter setting their differences aside, and Wraith promising to track down Kasady before teaming up with Peter to apprehend him. Completely moving this story over to Venom could be a bit of an anticlimax for Yuri Watanabe&#39;s vigilante arc, however, which has been built up since the start of Insomniac&#39;s story, making it more likely that Carnage will appear - however toned down - in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC instead.
