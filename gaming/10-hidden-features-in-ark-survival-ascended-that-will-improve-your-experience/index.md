## Literature Review

There are so many mechanics in Ark: Survival Ascended, it&#39;s natural that some players won&#39;t know all of these useful hidden features and tips. 




Ark: Survival Ascended has a lot of different features, some of which are hidden behind menus or console commands and may be hard to find or figure out for new players. Those who are veterans of the franchise and come from Evolved likely know many of the tricks, but even for them â€” some things have changed with the newest iteration of the title from Studio Wildcard.
Because there are so many mechanics inside of ASA, including taming and breeding, base-building, crafting, and more, getting overwhelmed is common for many new players. Even veterans who have spent hundreds of hours in the game may not be going about it in an optimal way, so learning these hidden features can save a bunch of time and make the gameplay experience much smoother.

Ark: Survival Ascended is a graphical revamp of Survival Evolved using UE5, but questions of what else has changed are worth exploring. 












 








 10  Use Console Commands For Better Performance 
Turn Off Clouds And Fog


 







The first thing that people will need to do is navigate to the Ark: Survival Ascended settings to turn on the console. To do this, select Settings&gt;Advanced&gt;Console Access and ensure it&#39;s toggled on. From here, PC users can hit the ~ key, while console players will need to hit the left menu or option button to access it. From here, there are a few commands that can be used to adjust certain graphics settings to improve performance.
  Console Command   Command Description    r.VolumetricCloud 0   Turns off clouds.    r.VolumetricFog 0   Turns off dust and increases view distance in the water.    r.ShadowQuality 0   Turns off shadows.    r.MaterialQualityLevel 0   Reduces textures on materials.    grass.densityScale 0   Flattens and removes grass and small shrubs.    





 9  Fast Inventory Hotbar 
Quickly Select Inventory Items


 







While it might be obvious that ASA has added a new function to quickly change ammo type by holding the reload button, there are also new quick-access toolbars that can be accessed and will organize items in the same order they are placed in the inventory. On PC, the default key is Q, while on consoles, it can be accessed by pressing L1 (LB) and up on the D-pad. This is a great way to quickly access new items without having to waste loads of time in inventory screens.
It&#39;s also possible to quickly access your shoulder pet&#39;s inventory by holding the reload button. 






 8  Wireless Crafting 
Overburdened No More
        

A huge update is the introduction of wireless crafting with Tek Dedicated Storage containers. Though they are a late-game item, in the past, it was necessary to ferry resources in the inventory to craft at various benches. Resources stored in Tek Dedicated Storage containers will automatically pull into whatever people craft at the stations, so long as they are in the same base. This saves loads of time having to transport goods all over the base and is a huge QoL improvement.
The Tek Replicator is required to build Tek Dedicated Storage containers. 






 7  Program Turret Targets 
Select Your Targets
        

While Turrets in Ark are nothing new, there is a new functionality within ASA that some don&#39;t end up using. Turrets can now be programmed by holding the interact button on a specific turret and then selecting &#34;Targeting Options.&#34; Then, it&#39;s possible to set certain creatures on target or do-not-target lists. This is useful because raiders have become accustomed to draining turrets by throwing low-level creatures to crack bases more easily, especially those that use turrets as the main line of defense.
Specific turrets can be programmed to target specific creatures or exclude specific creatures from its targeting list. 






 6  Use Rare Flowers To Lure Creatures 
More Than A Crafting Material
        

Passive creatures can sometimes be a struggle to tame, but consuming a Rare Flower to attract a dinosaur (rather than using the material to craft Exceptional Kibble) is a great way to lure a passive tame in ASA. This is especially useful for fast dinosaurs like the Oviraptor that will run away and might be hard to tranquilize or for those that prefer to use the trap method to tame creatures.
Quetzal and some Alpha creatures can not be aggroed by consuming a Rare Flower. 






 5  Lay Down To Regenerate Stamina 
Cutting Down On Food And Water Consumption


 







Food and Water bars drain whenever a character in Ark: Survival Ascended uses any bit of stamina when the stamina regenerates. This mechanism depletes resources in the long run since one must consume food and water more frequently to keep them full. One way to reduce how quickly these bars deplete is by laying down while regenerating stamina, as it&#39;ll consume less food and water than if the character stands and stops.
Stimberries and Energy Brews can also quickly regenerate stamina to prevent Food and Water drain. 






 4  Use Different Gamma Values For Night And Day 
Free Nightvision
        

Inside the Ark: Survival Ascended settings, there is a bindable hotkey that people can use to adjust the gamma or brightness of their screen set to two specific settings within the Settings and the Keybinds menu. While this doesn&#39;t seem like that big of a deal, it&#39;s a huge help when navigating in dark areas at nighttime when it&#39;s hard to see. Gamma can be set to around 2-3 around the daytime and around 4-5 at night to make it perpetually daytime in the game. While this will break some level of immersion, it&#39;s especially helpful if you&#39;re PvPing or exploring caves.

 3  Spoil Meat With The Toilet 
Easy Materials For Narcotic
        

If it&#39;s taking ages to obtain Spoiled Meat to use to make Narcotic for a specific tame, there&#39;s actually a useful feature in ASA that enables people to spoil stacks of meat easily. To spoil a lot of meat at once, simply place it in the toilet and have a character go to the bathroom, and all the meat will spoil. Previously, the tedious task of breaking up meat into smaller stacks so it would spoil quicker doesn&#39;t need to be done, which should make manufacturing Narcotic that much easier.

 2  Use The Cave Gathering Buff To Gain Resources 
Caves Are Great Sources For Unlimited Berries
        

Gathering resources outside of caves is a waste of time for those not taking advantage of the cave-gathering buff. ASA has added more incentive to journey into caves as the gathering rate inside of them is boosted significantly. This was not originally like this in Ark: Survival Evolved, so many may have missed it, especially those who tended to avoid caves unless it was necessary.
Avoid damage over time in caves using the Scuba gear or Gas Mask. 






 1  Use Baby Gigas To Quickly Level Your Tames 
Bred For A Purpose
        

Leveling to the max level in Ark: Survival Ascended is no easy task, but one clever method may make things easier. Gigas or Giganotosaurus is one of the coolest dinosaurs in Ark, but they also provide a hefty XP boost. While many people know this, they may not consider the concept of taming and breeding Gigas to not only level characters quickly but also to level their tamed dinosaurs faster. When babies are born, it&#39;s possible to unclaim them and then have tamed creatures take them out, gaining large amounts of XP with no risk involved.
