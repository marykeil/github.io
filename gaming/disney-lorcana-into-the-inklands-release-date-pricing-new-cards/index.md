## Literature Review

Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands is the third set for the TCG, arriving early next year with new location cards and fan-favorite characters.





Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands is packed full of &#39;90s nostalgia - new cards include those from TaleSpin and DuckTales. New cards will also include those from Treasure Planet and 101 Dalmatians. While new mats feature Disney Lorcana regulars Moana and Stitch, a portion of this third set of cards will have a focus on dogs - from Mickey&#39;s pal Pluto to Dalmatian matriarch Perdita. As usual, this latest expansion can be used to update current decks or as a jumping-off point for newcomers. To help new players, two new Starter Decks will also be arriving for Into The Inklands.

 New Cards In Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands 
          

There are over 200 new cards in Disney Lorcana: Into the Inklands. These cards will include new artwork for recurring characters like Mickey Mouse, Moana, Stitch, and Pongo. However, they&#39;ll also include new cards for characters like Scrooge McDuck from DuckTales and Kit from TaleSpin. Jim Hawkins and the RLS Legacy crew from Treasure Planet have also been confirmed. Of course, Into The Inklands will also feature Location cards for the first time. This will allow glimmers to visit iconic locales like Maleficent&#39;s Castle (pictured above), Motonui from Moana, and the Jolly Roger from Peter Pan.

The third set of Disney Lorcana looks promising already, and the addition of Location cards sounds great. The new set will be released on March 8, 2024, with early access in hobby stores beginning on February 23. As a reminder, cards from the first two sets - The First Chapter and Rise of the Floodborn - are not required to start playing the TCG, as Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands also works as a starting point for newcomers.
