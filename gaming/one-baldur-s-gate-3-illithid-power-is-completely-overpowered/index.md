## Literature Review

There are a lot of good Illithid Powers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the way that one in particular scales makes it a uniquely attractive option.




Illithid powers are a potent way to increase a character&#39;s prowess in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but not every power is created equal. Although customizing growth is a major part of the game across the board, taking from the complex leveling system of tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons, illithid powers most directly resemble the idea of a video game skill tree. Making the right choices when it comes to illithid powers can make a huge difference in the later parts of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and one particular ability has tremendous potential to transform a character in battle.




Not every Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 party will actually tap into illithid powers at all, as engaging with the feature is presented as a distinct narrative choice rather than an inevitability. The abilities take advantage of mind flayer parasites, so avoiding them entirely can feel like a safer way to maintain a character&#39;s humanity and dodge any possible consequences of illithid powers. Doing so, however, will result in one losing out on a lot of interesting benefits, and the Guardian who visits the protagonist in their dreams, frequently pushes the idea of accepting this unusual gift.

 Cull The Weak Is An Exceptional Illithid Power In BG3 
          




Getting the opportunity to deliver a finishing blow is a huge turning point in many Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 combat encounters. An enemy that&#39;s been worn down to 3 HP can be just as deadly as a fresh one with 100, but a dead enemy is, well, dead. Cull the Weak makes it significantly easier to finish off foes, instantly killing opponents once they&#39;re brought below a certain hit point threshold and dealing 1-4 Pyschic damage to any nearby creatures. The real game-changer is how that threshold is determined, as it makes use of an unusual mechanic that can be heavily abused with the right build.

Cull the Weak&#39;s trigger is based on the number of illithid powers that a character has evolved, meaning that it grows more and more powerful as any given character embraces more of their mind flayer potential. Considering how useful these other abilities can be on their own, it&#39;s a major win-win situation, and every investment in strengthening Cull the Weak is fundamentally serving double duty. This does require a lot of Illithid tadpoles, but there are plenty to be found across the course of a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaign, particularly for parties poking around enemy lairs or taking on a surplus of side quests.




                  Screen Rant&#39;s 2023 Game Of The Year   Screen Rant&#39;s Game of the Year 2023 is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, a testament to how much space remains for grand storytelling and characters.   

Although pushing it to its strongest level obviously takes some time, it doesn&#39;t take long to unlock Cull the Weak in its most basic form. The only prerequisite is the illithid power Concentrated Blast, which lets a caster that&#39;s concentrating on another spell deal some extra damage to a target. Concentrated Blast can be exceptional in its own right when used on an enemy caster who&#39;s also concentrating, as this condition will heal the user for half of the damage that they dole out.



 Optimizing Cull The Weak In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

At maximum, 25 illithid powers can be unlocked, which makes it easy to see just how powerful the ability can be. Eight of these are attached to a tier that can&#39;t be unlocked until the beginning of Act 3, limiting things to 17 up until that point, but that&#39;s still a significant number in any context. It&#39;s especially appealing when considering that the damage is guaranteed as long as the correct conditions are met, which applies to very few attacks in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This can make strategizing easier and more reliable in tough encounters, especially when a major brawl is tossing a surplus of foes into the turn order.






Magic missile can be a useful spell whenever damage is necessary, as it&#39;s a guaranteed hit outside of extenuating circumstances.




Fully optimizing Cull the Weak does have the one downside of taking the lion&#39;s share of those tadpoles for a single character for much of the game, so it can lead to underdevelopment of companions illithid powers in a campaign that&#39;s attempting to balance the distribution. By the time a party is progressing through Act 3, however, it should be easy enough to start evening things out. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 features enough tadpoles for a couple of characters to max out their illithid powers, and a special one that the Guardian offers counts for quite a lot on its own.

                  Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It)   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.   




Cull the Weak isn&#39;t perfect for every build, as the way that it kills characters is treated as fundamentally impersonal by the game rather than counting as a direct kill. Consequently, it can&#39;t combo with items like the Deathstalker Mantle that trigger upon the bearer killing an enemy. There are also a few spells and abilities that won&#39;t trigger Cull the Weak for similar reasons, where the game uses an entity besides the actual character behind the scenes to complete the action. Overall, though, these are fairly minor downsides for an ability that powerful, and they&#39;re hardly justification for swearing it off entirely.



 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Has Other Great Illithid Powers 
         

Cull the Weak obviously isn&#39;t the only good Illithid Power in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and there are a few others that are worth considering as particular priorities. Freecast is excellent in a pinch, letting a user remove resource costs for their next action once per long rest. Luck of the Far Realms is another that can be deployed once per long rest, turning a successful attack into a critical hit. Fly is great for general battlefield mobility, which can often be what makes or breaks difficult fights.




There&#39;s no shame in choosing to refuse illithid powers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as there are plenty of valid roleplay reasons to avoid this path. For anyone who does embrace the tadpoles&#39; potential, however, it&#39;s hard to do better than picking Cull the Weak for an upgrade. It&#39;s rare to find an ability that&#39;s built to scale in such a powerful way, making Cull the Weak a true standout among all of the interesting illithid powers that can be acquired over the course of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
