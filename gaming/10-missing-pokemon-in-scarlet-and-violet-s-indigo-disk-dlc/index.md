## Literature Review

Even with the addition of many returning Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet, there are still several notable absences.




There are several Pokémon missing in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC, even with the introduction of new creatures and the return of many fan favorites. The second expansion in the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack will conclude the story initiated by the Teal Mask expansion and shine light onto the Terastal Phenomenon that occurs in the region of Paldea – even if a portion of the DLC is set away from it. The additional content will send players on an exchange program with Naranja and Uva Academy’s sister school in Unova, called Blueberry Academy.
Visiting the new location and following the new storyline that was kicked off in the land of Kitakami will allow players to encounter a few new Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC. There will also be several returning Pokémon from previous generations, allowing players to obtain them in the Gen 9 games. Regardless of the influx of creatures, there are still 10 missing Pokémon from not only the Indigo Disk expansion for Scarlet and Violet but also the Nintendo Switch itself – these creatures cannot be captured in Gen 7’s Let’s Go! games or Gen 8’s Sword and Shield, Legends: Arceus, or Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.
            
 
 10 Clues Pokémon&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC Is Hinting At The Next Pokémon Game 
There are many hints in the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC that indicate the next Pokémon games are going to be Gen 5 remakes of Black and White.












 








 10  Patrat 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

As highlighted by Game Rant, there are 10 Pokémon that will still be missing from the core games on Nintendo Switch, even after the release of the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet. The first of them is Gen 5’s Patrat. The Normal-type Pokémon is one of the first creatures that players encounter when exploring Unova.
Granted, Patrat may not be among the most popular creatures, but it is not available in Let’s Go!, Sword and Shield, the Gen 4 remakes, or even Legends: Arceus. The creature is noticeably missing from any Nintendo Switch games and will continue to do so even after the arrival of The Indigo Disk.





 9  Watchog 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

Much like its predecessor, Watchog is also missing from any core Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch. The last time Watchog and Patrat were featured natively in a game was with Gen 6’s X and Y. They could be obtained and Gen 7’s Sun and Moon and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon via the Pokémon Bank, but not inside the games themselves.
Watchog is not a Pokémon that is particularly missed, but its absence is notable. Curiously enough, Watchog is one of the several Gen 5 creatures that will not be featured in Gen 9 with The Indigo Disk. This could be further evidence of upcoming Gen 5 remakes after Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.





 8  Pansage 
Gen 5 - Unova


 







Another creature from Unova, Pansage, is also missing from The Indigo Disk DLC. This Gen 5 Pokémon, along with the other elemental monkeys, may not be as popular as some of the returning creatures, but they have been missing for a long time.
Pansage’s last in-game appearance was also with Gen 6’s X and Y, even if it was obtainable in Gen 7’s Sun and Moon and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon via the Pokémon Bank. This creature is not obtainable in any core Nintendo Switch games and is not transferable from Pokémon HOME to Scarlet and Violet.





 7  Simisage 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

Pansage’s evolution, Simisage, is also plagued by its unavailability in core Pokémon games on the Nintendo Switch. The Pokémon’s last appearance was also in X and Y and will remain incompatible with Gen 9 games after the release of the Indigo Disk for Scarlet and Violet.
The Grass-type monkey evolution’s absence, like Patrat, Watchog, and Simisage puts Unova in the spotlight and further reinforces the Pokémon Gen 5 remake leaks that are widely theorized upon. It may not amount to anything, but it sure looks like evidence.





 6  Pansear 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

Like Pansage, the Fire-type Pansear is also going to continue absent from any core Pokémon games on the Nintendo Switch following the arrival of the Indigo Disk DLC. This other elemental monkey’s last appearance was also in Gen 6 and is currently unobtainable in Gen 9.
Like all the aforementioned creatures, they can be stored in Pokémon HOME on the Nintendo Switch. However, they cannot be transferred to any of the games currently available on the platform. Pansear is yet another Gen 5 creature missing from the hybrid console’s titles.





 5  Simisear 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

Pansear’s evolution, Simisear is another Unova Pokémon on the list of absents from Gen 9 and, in fact, any core Pokémon games on Nintendo’s hybrid console. The Fire-type creature adds to the other currently missing elemental monkeys.
Simisear has not been confirmed or even leaked as one of the returning Pokémon in The Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet, which will make his reappearance in the series a mystery until otherwise announced. There are grounds for this Pokémon to be added eventually, but so far it is incompatible with the Gen 8 and Gen 9 games.





 4  Panpour 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

Panpour is the last of the base elemental monkeys to not be present in the Gen 8 or Gen 9 Pokémon games for Nintendo Switch. Like the other creatures, this Unova creature is also not included in the roster of returning Pokémon with The Indigo Disk DLC. This is not to say the creature has not been added to any Pokémon titles in recent years, as Panpour and the other monkeys have made their debut in Pokémon GO.
Regardless, it has been impossible to natively obtain Panpour since X and Y, and its last inch of compatibility happened with Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon via transferences from the Pokémon Bank. So far, it is unknown when Panpour will be usable in Nintendo Switch games.





 3  Simipour 
Gen 5 - Unova
        

As Panpour’s evolution, it is natural that Simipour is also missing from Switch games, even after the release of the Indigo Disk DLC. Scarlet and Violet leaks do not have mentions of Simipour or its predecessor, so they will not become available in Paldea.
If the Gen 5 remakes are true, this may change soon, as they are native from Unova. Nevertheless, the remakes have not yet been leaked or confirmed, with only theories revolving around them, so players may have to wait some more time before seeing Simipour again.





 2  Furfrou 
Gen 6 - Kalos


 







Stepping away from Gen 5 and the Unova region, there is a Pokémon from Gen 6’s Kalos that is currently unavailable in any core Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch. Furfrou, the poodle-like creature cannot be obtained in Let’s Go!, Sword and Shield, Legends: Arceus, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, or Scarlet and Violet.
It seems like it will remain like this, as The Indigo Disk has no intention of establishing Furfrou as a returning Pokémon for Scarlet and Violet. Furfrou has a total of 10 different forms related to its hair trim, so all of these would need to be coded into the games. This does not seem like a problem, however, as all four Deerling and Sawsbuck forms are in Gen 9, as well as Vivillon and the Flabébé family.





 1  Minior 
Gen 7 - Alola


 







The last of the Pokémon that will remain unavailable on the Nintendo Switch after the release of the Indigo Disk DLC is Gen 7’s Minior. The Rock- and Flying-type creature from Alola, like Furfrou, has several forms, though that may be unrelated to the lack of its presence in Gen 8 and Gen 9 games.
The last time Minior appeared natively in a game was in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, and it has not been compatible with any transferring services. It can be held in Pokémon HOME, but not sent to any Nintendo Switch games. Though the lack of these creatures is notable, there are hundreds of monsters supported by Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and other Switch titles.
