## Literature Review

With the release of version 1.20 in Minecraft, there still remain 40 unique enchantments in the game. Here are 10 must-have upgrades for all gear.





Enchantments are typically first discovered on weapons or Armor found in chests. Later, players can create an Enchanting Table to exchange their experience for a specific boon. These can be broken into four main categories: Weapon Enchantment, Armor Enchantment, Tool Enchantment, and All Purpose Enchantment. Since there are so many enchantments in the game, it is hard to pick the best ones for each player. Depending on the weapons used and the biome, some may be more useful than others. Below are some of the ten most universally coveted enchantments in Minecraft 1.20.
            
 
 10 Best Minecraft Seeds For Cherry Blossom 
The Cherry Blossom biome is fairly hard to find in Minecraft, but players can generate worlds that guarantee this environment using the best seeds.













 








 10  Efficiency 
Increases Mining Speed
        

Efficiency is a Tool Enchantment in Minecraft that increases mining speed. This is most commonly obtained from an Enchantment Table. You can also trade Librarian Villagers for an Efficiency Book in the Desert Biome.
After the 1.20 update, the Enchantment Books offered by Librarian Villagers are guaranteed based on the biome. 






 9  Fortune 
Increase the number of items dropped.


 







Fortune is another Tool Enchantment that increases the number of items dropped from mining specific blocks. Having Fortune and Efficiency on a Pickaxe speeds up progress tremendously when searching for large amounts of a certain material, such as Diamond. Fortune can commonly be learned at an Enchantment Table or traded for from a Librarian Villager in a Taiga Biome.





 8  Feather Falling 
Reduces fall damage
        

Feather Falling is an Armor Enchantment in Minecraft that reduces the amount of fall damage taken. While this may not initially seem like an important skill, it can be vital for survival. Whether escaping foes or delving deep into a mine, there are times when you canâ€™t simply expect a sudden fall. Feather Falling can most commonly be learned at an Enchantment Table or traded for from a Librarian Villager in a Jungle Biome.





 7  Multishot 
Fire three arrows in one shot
        

Multishot is a Weapon Enchantment that allows three arrows to be fired for the price of one. This is incredibly efficient and increases damage output tremendously. Mending is most commonly obtained from an Enchantment Table.





 6  Infinity 
Fire infinite arrows


 







Infinity is another Weapon Enchantment that can be applied to Bows, but not Crossbows like Multishot. This allows the weapon to be fired without consuming arrows. Combined with the aforementioned Multishot, players can dispatch a group of enemies from afar with minimal effort. Infinity can be most commonly obtained from an Enchantment Table or by trading with a Librarian Villager in a Desert Biome.





 5  Luck Of The Sea 
Find rare items while Fishing
        

Luck of the Sea is a Tool Enchantment, possibly the best, that can be applied to Fishing Rods in Minecraft. This increases the chance of finding rare items when Fishing. Enchantment Books can be found through this method, with the best one being obtained. Luck of the Sea is most commonly obtained from an Enchanting Table.





 4  Sharpness 
Increase sword damage
        

Sharpness is a simple Weapon Enchantment that increases the damage dealt. This can be increased to Sharpness V to defeat any but the toughest foes in just a few swings. Sharpness is most commonly earned from an Enchantment Table or by trading with a Librarian Villager in a Savanna.





 3  Protection 
Decreases damage taken.
        

Protection is an Armor Enchantment that decreases the damage taken. This can be upgraded to Protection IV on all pieces of Armor to dramatically nullify enemy hits. Protection is essential for surviving against strong foes. You can get this enchantment, most commonly from an Enchantment Table or trading with a Librarian Villager in a Plains Biome.





 2  Unbreaking 
Increases durability
        

Unbreaking is one of the best enchantments in Minecraft. This can be applied to Tools, Weapons, and Armor. Unbreaking increases the durability of an item breaking. This limits the number of times players need to repair their gear before leaving camp. Unbreaking can most commonly be earned from an Enchanting Table or trading with a Librarian Villager in a Jungle Biome.





 1  Mending 
Repair tools &amp; weapons with XP


 







Mending is arguably the best and most useful enchantment in Minecraft. This repairs the durability of items when earning experience. When combined with Unbreaking, gear is practically indestructible. Durability is repaired from all experience, meaning Armor and weapons can be easily maintained out of combat. Mending is most commonly earned by Fishing or trading with a Librarian Villager in a Swamp Biome.
