## Literature Review

After defeating enemies below the Open Hand Temple in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, you&#39;ll find a Strange Flower Key that you may use to reveal a sinister plot.





To use the Flowery Key, you need to head to Fraygo&#39;s Flophouse, a bunkhouse and hostel on Wyrm&#39;s Crossing. However, before leaving the Open Hand Temple, make sure to investigate the crime scene a bit more closely. If you&#39;ve learned to Speak With the Dead, you can obtain extra information from the killers themselves. A successful Perception check at X:67, Y:-1018 will reveal a hole containing the murder weapon: the enchanted Stillmaker dagger.

 How To Use The Strange Flower Key In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 (BG3) 
          

Fraygo&#39;s Flophouse is located in the southwestern part of Wyrm&#39;s Crossing, directly opposite Sharess&#39; Caress in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. To use the Strange Flower Key, head up to the second floor and interact with the ladder in one of the rooms to climb up to the attic. The Strange Flower Key will unlock the wardrobe in the attic, revealing a hidden room.



Make sure to include Astarion in your party when visiting Fraygo&#39;s Flophouse. If he&#39;s present, the party can interact with some vampire spawn to get additional context for Astarion&#39;s companion quest to defeat the vampire lord Cazador.

 How To Investigate The Open Hand Temple Murders In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Inside the hidden room is a lot of evidence for your investigation. The most important item to pick up is the Bloodstained Parchment on the table, which lists more potential victims for a murder spree in honor of Bhaal. Anyone who kills all the targets gains an audience with the Dread Tribunal and can enter the hidden Temple of Bhaal. You can stop the murderer by warning the victims throughout the Lower City or hunt and kill them yourself if you&#39;re evil-aligned. 



By passing a Perception check, you can also discover the body of the Stern Librarian Ffion, an employee of Sharess&#39; Caress, under the bed. You can report to her employer, Mamzell Amira, in Sharess&#39; Caress. She will reward you by letting you hire the Drow Twins, a couple of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s one-time romance partners, for a discount.







To conclude this part of the investigation, head to Sharess&#39; Caress and speak to Investigator Valeria to present your evidence. Despite her skepticism, she will direct the party to speak with Gauntlet Devella, who can help with the investigation. To do this, she will provide a pass, allowing you to enter the Lower City and continue your adventures in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
