## Literature Review

Although new characters and events are the highlights of each version, Genshin Impact 4.3 may add some long-awaited quality-of-life updates.




A set of new Genshin Impact 4.3 leaks has been shared, revealing that a few long-awaited quality-of-life updates are finally being added to the game, which may make claiming rewards a whole lot easier. As a live-service title, HoYoverse’s popular action RPG constantly receives updates through regular patches every six weeks. While the main focus tends to be on new characters, story missions, map locations, banner reruns, and limited-time events, these updates occasionally drop in some quality-of-life features that make players’ time in the game a whole lot easier. In Version 4.2, for instance, the game received a quick-start mechanic for weekly bosses,




Now, players can farm Talent materials for newly added characters even if they haven’t caught up with the main story. Those who are still behind in the Inazuma arc, for instance, can face the All-Devouring Narwhal in Genshin Impact to get the required materials to level up Furina’s abilities, for example. Ahead of the official reveal of the upcoming version, there have been many leaks, from the abilities used by the new characters to limited-time game modes that will be featured in events. This time, a set of quality-of-life features has been leaked, indicating that claiming rewards will be easier, as well as leveling characters between Ascension thresholds.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: New Skins May Be The Most Beautiful So Far   According to leaks, Genshin Impact will introduce two new skins in Version 4.4 - and they have the potential to be the most beautiful ones so far.   


 Two New Major Quality-Of-Life Updates May Arrive With Genshin Impact 4.3 
         




Aside from more newsworthy pieces of information, such as Navia’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact, or even Chevreuse’s abilities, there are also quality-of-life (QoL) updates being added to the game in Version 4.3, according to leaks. As seen in a video posted by Genshin Universe on X, there will be changes to expedition rewards, that will make claiming the items a lot easier. In another video posted by Genshin Universe, it seems like the process of leveling characters after they have been ascended will be easier as well. These QoL updates seemingly accompany the update that will make farming easier in Genshin Impact 4.3, which has also been leaked.



The aforementioned farming update should add a feature to Domains, where players who challenge the activity more than once are teleported to the key where they trigger the fight rather than back to the start.






 Leaked Expedition Rewards Claiming System In Genshin Impact 4.3 Can Save Time 
          




According to the first post by Genshin Universe, there will be a new update to the claiming mechanic in the expeditions system. Upon approaching Katheryne at the Adventurer’s Guild, players will be able to claim all the rewards of their expeditions with a single click. Currently, players have to visit the pages of the regions they dispatched characters to and individually click upon each of them, only to click again to claim them. If they have characters in different regions farming resources in Genshin Impact, they have to navigate through each region, one by one until all the expedition rewards have been claimed.

It is not a terribly time-consuming process, but it is certainly a lot longer than it has to be. Proof of this is the leak, which highlights the button that sees all expedition rewards claimed in a single swoop. Another great benefit detailed by the leak is that players may be able to redispatch their characters on the same expeditions with the click of a single button immediately after claiming the rewards. At the moment, players have to manually revisit the destination of each expedition and choose the character from their Genshin Impact roster that they want to send.




Much like claiming rewards, redispatching characters on expeditions is not a long process, but it could definitely be optimized, even if it happens three years after launch. Such a feature is present in other HoYoverse games, such as Honkai: Star Rail, so it is past time that Genshin Impact receives an optimization similar to this. Over the course of days and weeks, those extra seconds spent on claiming rewards and dispatching characters on new expeditions can be better used for farming materials and engaging in other activities in the game. Again, it is not a game-changing quality-of-life update, but one that can make the daily grinding experience a lot smoother.



 Leveling In Genshin Impact 4.3 May Be Simplified For The Better 
          

In the other post shared by Genshin Universe on X, the video shows that the process of leveling characters may undergo some changes that seem positive. The first and most noticeable of them is the auto-add button, which will automatically add all the required materials to get the character to their next maximum level. This will always be capped by an Ascension threshold, so if a character is level 1 and the function is used, they will be taken to level 20, and then they have to be Ascended in order to unlock the usage of the leveling materials in Genshin Impact via the auto-add button once again.




Currently, players have to click on the specific item they want to use, be they Wanderer’s Advice, Adventurer’s Experience, or Hero’s Wit. Then, they have to continuously add copies of the material until they make the character reach the intended level – or until the resources are depleted. While there is a way of quickening the process, as holding down the button to add will make multiple stacks be added consecutively, it is still a process that is longer than it has to be. Even if limited, weapons and Artifacts in Genshin Impact have an auto-add button, so not having it in characters up to now is somewhat abnormal.

                  Genshin Impact: Cloud Retainer&#39;s Leaked Release Date Is Actually Perfect   New leaks suggest that the adeptus Cloud Retainer’s human form will be released as a playable character in an upcoming Genshin Impact patch.   

The other unspoken detail about the leak is the fact that players can now stack Character EXP Materials of different types instead of only being able to use one at a time. At the moment, players can only use one of the three types of materials at a time, which means they have to use however many Hero’s Wit they need, level up, and then add Adventurer’s Experience, for instance. With the leaked quality-of-life update in Genshin Impact 4.3, players will be able to mix and match Wanderer’s Advice, Adventurer’s Experience, and Hero’s Wit to meet their Character EXP needs in a single swoop.




Both quality-of-life updates are leaks, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. The information provided may be incorrect or simply subject to change. It may even be pushed back into another upcoming patch, well beyond Version 4.3. Nevertheless, these minor updates, in addition to all the new characters and playable material are making the world of Genshin Impact a much better and optimized place for players who have to grind on a daily basis.
