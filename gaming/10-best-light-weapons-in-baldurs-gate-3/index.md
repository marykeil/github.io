 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Thorn Blade 
Rare Scimitar Can Be Bought In Act 2
        

Thorn Blade is a plus one scimitar that deals 1d6 slashing damage and an additional 1d4 poison damage if the wielder concentrates on a spell. Luckily, Thorn Blade also comes enchanted with such a spell, an ensnaring strike, which wraps targets up in thorny vines, immobilizing them. Thorn Blade is great for spellcasters and can be purchased from Dammon at the Last Light Inn in Act 2.





 9  Sussur Sickle/Dagger 
Rare Weapons Crafted In Act 1


&#34;Finish the Masterwork Weapon&#34; is an Act 1 quest where the party has the choice of three weapons to create. According to Gamerpillar, two of those options, the dagger and the sickle, are light weapons and are both excellent choices. Both weapons deal 1d4 plus one damage and cast silence on the target, making both the dagger and sickle fantastic against enemy spellcasters early in BG3.
By default, the off-hand attack does not add a character&#39;s ability modifier to the damage; however, with Two-Weapon Fighting, the modifier is added. This fighting style is available for fighters, paladins, rangers, and College of Swords bards.







 8  Stillmaker 
Very Rare Dagger Found In Act 3
        

When investigating the cave underneath the Open Hand Temple during the quest &#34;Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders,&#34; the party can find this awesome dagger. Stillmaker is one of the best pieces of hidden loot, as the dagger is in a hole close to one of the entrances. While Stillmaker&#39;s 1d4 plus two isn&#39;t the most impressive, the dagger does come with the spell Hold Person, which is excellent for crowd control.





 7  Ne&#39;er Misser 
Uncommon Hand Crossbow Can Be Bought In Act 2
        

Ne&#39;er Misser is an excellent hand crossbow that can be bought from Roah Moonglow when the party reaches Moonrise Towers in Baldur Gate 3&#39;s Act 2. Ne&#39;er Misser is unique as it deals 1d6 plus one force damage rather than the traditional piecing. But what makes Ne&#39;er Misser a must-have is that the wielder can cast Magic Missiles at third level once per short rest. This is great as force damage can break through walls, doors, and chests, while Magic Missile is a guaranteed hit each time.

There are so many hidden secrets, items, and quests tucked away in the Shadowlands of Act Two in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for players to discover.



It&#39;s very easy for Roah to die in Act 1 in the Goblin Camp if the party&#39;s attacks on Priestess Gut draw too much attention, which means some parties may lose out on this great crossbow.







 6  Justiciar&#39;s Scimitar 
Very Rare Scimitar Looted In Act 2


The Justiciar&#39;s Scimitar is a fantastic but difficult-to-get light weapon in BG3. The blade is dropped by Lyrthindor in the Gauntlet of Shar, who will be encountered if the party chooses to help save Yurgir in BG3. The scimitar deals 1d6 plus two damage and can blind the target if the attack is advantageous. According to the above video by Gamerpillar, this pairs wonderfully with stealthy builds and is one of only two weapons in BG3 with the weapon action Shadowsoaked Blow to deal extra psychic damage.





 5  Torch Of Revocation 
Very Rare Club Quest Reward In Act 3
        

The Torch of Revocation of a light club that, on top of its 1d4 plus one of bludgeoning damage, does an extra 1d4 of both necrotic and fire. There are a few ways to gain this unusual weapon, but all involve the Mystic Carrion, the mummy lord residing in Baldur&#39;s Gate. The Torch of Revocation can be rewarded for completing the quest &#34;Find Mystic Carrion&#39;s Servant&#34; or purchased from him for 3000 Gold.
The Torch of Revocation is needed to complete the quest &#34;Free the Artist,&#34; which begins in the Zhentarim hideout in Act 1 before concluding in Act 3.







 4  Hellfire Hand Crossbow 
Very Rare Hand Crossbow Looted In Act 2


The Hellfire Hand Crossbow is a tremendous light weapon that can be gained by defeating Yurgir or tricking him into killing himself. The Hellfire Hand Crossbow does 1d6 plus damage with the possibility of inflicting burning on the target if the wielder is hidden or invisible. According to Gamerpillar, this light weapon works very well for stealth-based characters such as rogues or Gloom Stalker Rangers. Finally, the Hellfire Hand Crossbow can cast Scorching Ray at the third level to hurl out four rays of fire, each dealing 2d6 fire damage.





 3  Crimson Mischief 
Legendary Shortsword Looted In Act 3
        

Crimson Mischief is one of two weapons that can be gained after defeating Orin in Act 3 of BG3. Crimson Mischief deals 1d6 plus piercing damage and 1d4 necrotic damage, and an extra 1d4 piercing if the target has less than 50% of their hit points. On top of that, this shortsword has different properties based on whether it is the main hand or off-hand weapon. In a character&#39;s main hand, it will deal an extra seven damage if the attack was made with advantage. As an off-hand weapon, Crimson Mischief allows the character&#39;s ability modifier to be added to the damage without needing the Two-Weapon Fighting Style.





 2  Bloodthirst 
Legendary Dagger Looted In Act 3
        

Bloodthirst is the sister weapon to Crimson Mischief and dropped by Orin after defeating her. Like Crimson Mischief, Bloodthirst has different properties based on whether it is a main or off-hand weapon. As a main hand dagger, Bloodthirst inflicts targets hit with vulnerability to piercing damage, while as an off-hand weapon, it increases its wielder&#39;s AC by one and will cast True Strike automatically if they miss an attack.​​​​​​​

Regardless of which hand holds it, Bloodthirst deals 1d4 plus two piercing damage and reduces the number needed for a critical hit by one, which stacks with other similar effects. Wielders gain the cantrip true strike, which can be cast once per short rest. Bloodthirst is also a bound weapon, which means it cannot be knocked out of its wielder&#39;s hand and will automatically return when thrown.





 1  Knife Of The Undermountain King 
Very Rare Shortsword Can Be Bought In Act 1
        

The Knife of the Undermountain King is a fantastic shortsword that can be bought from the Githyanki quartermaster A&#39;jak&#39;nir Jeera in Crèche Y&#39;llek when doing Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest. This rare shortword deals 1d6 plus piercing damage and reduces the number needed for a critical hit by one. The Organ Rearranger ability also allows damage to be rerolled if the original damage rolled was two or less.
The Knife of the Undermountain King&#39;s second feature is Shadow Blade, which gives the wielder an advantage on attack rolls against light or heavily obscured targets. This, along with Organ Rearranger, obviously pairs exceptionally well with sneak attack damage. This blade is picked up towards the end of Act 1 but can easily still be useful right through to Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, especially for Rogues.
