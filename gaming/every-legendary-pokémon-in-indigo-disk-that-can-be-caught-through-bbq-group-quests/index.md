# Every Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk That Can Be Caught Through BBQ Group Quests


## SUMMARY

The DLC introduces Blueberry Quests (BBQs) as a method for seeking out and capturing Legendaries, with different difficulties and objectives.

## Literature Review

In the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, legendary Pokémon from past generations can be obtained through doing Blueberry Quests.




Similarly to past games, The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet allows players to catch a number of Legendary Pokémon from past generations through slightly convoluted means - although not every past legendary is available, and some version-exclusive Legendaries require extra steps to catch. While longtime players can simply transfer past-generation Legendaries from Pokémon HOME, The Indigo Disk adds a way for newer players, or those who might&#39;ve missed a specific generation or past version exclusive, to catch a large variety of Legendaries.




Like the Dynamax Adventure mechanic in Sword and Shield&#39;s Crown Tundra DLC, The Indigo Disk brings its own method of seeking out and capturing Legendaries in the form of Blueberry Quests, or BBQs. Introduced not long after starting The Indigo Disk, BBQs take the form of side quests with a wide variety of objectives and difficulty levels, like catching specific Pokémon or battling in specific ways. On their own, BBQs mostly serve as a relatively simple way to farm BP, with higher-difficulty quests that give more BP being offered after completing a set number of normal quests. However, BBQs are also vital to catching every Legendary Pokémon in The Indigo Disk.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 How BBQs Work In The Indigo Disk 
         




Through the NPC Snacksworth in Blueberry Academy, who only shows up after completing The Indigo Disk&#39;s main story, players can receive treats that allow for specific Legendary Pokémon to be found, battled, and caught in certain areas. Each item is intended for a specific Legendary, and Snacksworth gives them in a random order - in single player, a new treat can be claimed from him for every ten BBQs completed by the player. Once a treat for a specific Legendary Pokémon has been claimed from Snacksworth, they can be found at a specific location in the base game Paldea region, with Snacksworth providing some hints as to where each one can be found.

With a few exceptions, each of the Legendary Pokémon that can be caught through completing BBQs is version exclusive, and the overall pool of Legendaries is somewhat smaller than past games - notably missing, for example, are the guardian deities and Ultra Beasts from Alola, the major Legendary bird trio of Kalos, and any Legendary from Sinnoh, although some of these can be caught through other means or transferred from Pokémon HOME. While doing BBQs solo can only net players the version-exclusive Legendaries, there are still ways to get every Legendary without having to trade for or transfer them.




                  Why You&#39;re Missing One New Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC   With one elusive final Pokémon to go, there&#39;s still an extra stretch for completionists before passing the finish line of The Indigo Disk DLC.   

Completing a certain number of lower-ranked quests in co-op through Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Union Room will grant players access to rarer, harder gold-colored BBQs that are exclusive to Union Room play. Completing one of these quests will also prompt Snacksworth to give out a random treat - but instead of pulling from the pool of Legendaries exclusive to the version that&#39;s being played, he&#39;ll instead give a treat for a random Legendary exclusive to the opposite version, or one of three Legendary Pokémon exclusive to the Union Circle as a whole.



Clearing 10 blue BBQs will grant access to a red BBQ, and clearing three red BBQs while in co-op in a Union Circle will grant access to a gold BBQ.









 Which Pokémon Can Be Caught Through Group BBQs In Pokémon Scarlet 
          

For each version of the game, the Legendary Pokémon available through solo BBQs are mostly separate according to which group the Legendary is in, or in terms of past generation version exclusives. Scarlet, for example, gets access to the Legendary beast trio of Suicune, Entei, and Raikou, and past-generation exclusive box Legendaries like Groudon and Solgaleo. Being able to find and catch Legendaries exclusive to Violet requires players to do the gold-colored Union Circle quests. Although, notably, connecting with players of the opposite version isn&#39;t required for Snacksworth to grant access to exclusive Legendaries, unlike the methods for catching version exclusive Paradox Pokémon in the base game.

The following Legendary Pokémon can only be caught through Union Circle BBQs in Pokémon Scarlet:




 Pokémon  Type   Lugia  Psychic/Flying   Latias  Dragon/Psychic   Kyogre  Water   Rayquaza  Dragon/Flying   Cobalion  Steel/Fighting   Terrakion  Rock/Fighting   Virizion  Grass/Fighting   Zekrom  Dragon/Electric   Kyurem  Dragon/Ice   Lunala  Psychic/Ghost   Necrozma  Psychic   Spectrier  Ghost   








 Which Pokémon Can Be Caught Through Group BBQs In Pokémon Violet 
          

Similarly, players with Pokémon Violet will only be able to catch some of The Indigo Disk&#39;s Legendaries through gold-colored Union Circle BBQs, with each quest granting access to a random Pokémon from the pool of mostly Legendaries that would normally be exclusive to Scarlet. However, for both versions of the game, there are three Legendary Pokémon that aren&#39;t version exclusive but rather can only be caught through doing Union Circle quests in either version: Rayquaza, Kyurem, and Necrozma, each the &#34;master&#34; of their respective Legendary trios.

The following Legendary Pokémon are only available through Union Circle BBQs in Pokémon Violet:

 Pokémon  Type   Ho-Oh  Fire/Flying   Latios  Dragon/Psychic   Groudon  Ground   Rayquaza  Dragon/Flying   Raikou  Electric   Entei  Fire   Suicune  Water   Reshiram  Dragon/Fire   Kyurem  Dragon/Ice   Solgaleo  Psychic/Steel   Necrozma  Psychic   Glastrier  Ice   






Each of the Pokémon that is only available through Union Circle BBQs in one version can be caught in the opposite version by doing offline, solo BBQs. Additionally, the Kanto Legendary bird trio of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, as well as Kubfu from Sword and Shield&#39;s Isle of Armor DLC, can all be caught by simply doing solo BBQs in either version.

The Pokémon are made available by Snacksworth in a random order, but once one has been found and caught, it will be removed from the pool of available Legendaries. This means that catching every BBQ Legendary in The Indigo Disk requires 130 blue BBQs and 12 additional gold Union Circle BBQs, since doing blue and red BBQs is required to gain access to gold BBQs, grinding solely in a Union Circle can speed up the process.

While many players are likely to already have many of the Legendary Pokémon that can be caught through BBQs, they serve as a good (but grindy) way to obtain past generation Legendaries that some players might have missed from previous entries. And, with The Indigo Disk&#39;s infinite Master Ball trick, actually catching each Legendary can be extremely simple. As Pokémon Scarlet and Violet still has a bit more content to come, including a story epilogue, the game might receive some more past-generation Legendaries in the future.
