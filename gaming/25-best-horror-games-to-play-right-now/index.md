 25  System Shock (2023) 
Platforms: PC, Mac, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S
        

  System Shock  


  Franchise    System Shock     Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , macOS , Linux , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    May 30, 2023     Developer(s)    NightDive Studios     Genre(s)    Action-Adventure , First-Person Shooter    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4/5    Metacritic   78    Steam   Very Positive    
Based on the 1994 original first-person sci-fi/horror game, 2023&#39;s System Shock is a faithful - and terrifying - recreation. Set aboard a derelict space station overtaken by an aggressive AI named SHODAN, it&#39;s discovered that the crew is dead and that the AI system has taken over the ship. With colorful yet creepy visuals and a unique yet tense atmosphere, players explore the labyrinth-like ship while speaking with the power-obsessed SHODAN and its horrifying mutated crew members. The original game served as the inspiration for Bioshock, making this remake a unique and memorable experience and a must-play for horror fans.





 24  Amnesia: The Bunker (2023) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S
        

  Amnesia: The Bunker  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    May 23, 2023     Developer(s)    Frictional Games     Genre(s)    Survival Horror     Sequel    Amnesia: Rebirth    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4/5    Metacritic   78    Steam   Very Positive    
Survival horror Amnesia: The Bunker is the fourth installment in the Amnesia series. With creepy sound design and a shadowy atmosphere, it takes much of what made the franchise so popular and improves upon it. Unlike prior games, the entire world map is available upon spawning in, enabling wider exploration not before seen in the franchise. Set during WW1 in 1916, Amnesia: The Bunker focuses on the struggle of a French soldier named Henri Clément as he seeks to survive the dank, abandoned bunker he finds himself in. Though there are many outright frights, much of the horror of the title is generated by the looming presence of the stalker and the game&#39;s well-crafted environments.





 23  Mundaun (2021) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S
        

 Mundaun 


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox Series X , PC , Nintendo Switch , Xbox One , PlayStation 5     Released    March 16, 2021     Developer(s)    Hidden Fields     Publisher(s)    MWN Interactive     Genre(s)    Adventure , Horror    


  Website   Score    Metacritic   72    Steam   Very Positive    
Mundaun is a creative indie horror title with a unique black-and-white pencil art style and strange missions that sometimes border on bizarre. The game follows Curdin, who returns to his hometown for his grandfather&#39;s funeral. What follows is a beautiful first-person horror that forces one to explore and experiment to unlock the curious story hidden within the game&#39;s challenging puzzles. With little direction provided over its narrative, it&#39;s up to the player to uncover the game&#39;s true story. Mundaun is praised for its fascinating visuals, brooding soundtrack, and unique narrative based on Swedish folklore.





 22  The Quarry (2022) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S
        

  The Quarry  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    June 10, 2022     Developer(s)    Supermassive Games     Genre(s)    Adventure , Survival Horror    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   3/5    Metacritic   79    Steam   Very Positive    
Filled to the brim with a talented cast of characters, 2022&#39;s The Quarry is a playable take on the tried-and-true camp-setting horror made popular by films like Friday the 13th. Events quickly unravel as the camp counselors must avoid a killer threat - and reveal the mystery stalking the campsite. As is tradition with other Supermassive titles, The Quarry features well-known actors, including David Arquette and Brenda Song, on top of boasting 186 different endings. The game stands as one of the more recent and polished interactive horror games out there right now.





 21  Alien: Isolation (2014) 
Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One
        

  Alien: Isolation  


  Franchise    Alien     Platform(s)    Android , iOS , Linux , OS X , Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360 , Xbox One     Released    October 6, 2014     Developer(s)    Creative Assembly     Publisher(s)    Sega     Genre(s)     Sci-Fi , Survival Horror    


  Website   Score    Metacritic   79    Steam   Very Positive    
Alien: Isolation is a survival horror title that owes a lot of its scares to the amazing sound design and creepy, tense atmosphere. Played from a first-person perspective, Amanda Ripley (the daughter of Ellen Ripley) must explore an abandoned space station while avoiding enemies, including other humans, androids, and, of course, the titular Alien. There is a palpable feeling of dread, and much of the story reflects beats from the original film. With lived-in-feeling detailed environments, creepy audio, and interesting stealth gameplay, Alien: Isolation is a must-play - especially for horror movie fans.





 20  Outlast (2013) 
Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch
        

 Outlast 


  Platform(s)    PC , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Nintendo Switch     Released    September 4, 2013     Developer(s)    Red Barrels     Publisher(s)    Red Barrels     Genre(s)    Survival Horror    


  Website   Score    Metacritic   80    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
A single-player first-person experience, in Outlast the protagonist is an investigative journalist who sets off to explore the creepy corridors of Mount Massive Asylum psychiatric hospital. Filled with mutated homicidal patients, the game is highly atmospheric with a stripped-down UI, and relies on the fear of the unseen to really terrify. Rather than taking on enemies head-on, it&#39;s imperative to use stealth and sneak around to accomplish game objectives. Prepare to run.





 19  Little Nightmares 2 (2021) 
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S


 







  Little Nightmares 2  


  Franchise    Little Nightmares     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    August 25, 2021     Developer(s)    Tarsier Studios , Supermassive Games     Publisher(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment     Genre(s)    Adventure , Horror , Platformer , Puzzle    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   3.5/5    Metacritic   82    Steam   Very Positive    
Though the cartoon aesthetic and cute large-headed characters in Little Nightmares 2 may lead most to believe it&#39;s a kid&#39;s game, it successfully creates a dark and lived-in presentation, making it one of the best single-player horror titles currently available to play. Building upon its predecessor, the sequel of the title improves the controls and adds more content while retaining the same dark and spooky environments in the new Pale City. A puzzle platformer and adventure game at its heart, the game follows the adventures of Mono and Six, the latter of whom was the main character from the original title.





 18  Soma (2015) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S
        

  Website   Score    Metacritic   84    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Questions revolving around AI, identity, and reality itself are at the forefront of this survival horror title. Soma creates an otherworldly experience through its shadowy corridors, deeply disturbing body horror, and robotic monstrosities. Much of the game&#39;s terror comes from the creeping atmosphere the game can create through its vivid graphics and excellent sound design. As people patch together the story behind the narrative events of the game, the ending will leave most thinking back on their actions in this tense psychological horror title.





 17  Signalis (2021) 
Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch
        

  Signalis  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    October 27, 2022     Developer(s)    rose-engine     Publisher(s)    Humble Games , PLAYISM     Genre(s)    Survival Horror    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   83    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Signalis is a pixel-art survival horror game from a 2.5D perspective. It is widely acclaimed but often goes underappreciated. With deep, hidden lore that must be uncovered throughout the game, Signalis is certainly a slower horror title that requires one to take their time to unravel the game&#39;s deep lore. Cryptic and brooding, people must solve a variety of different puzzles scattered throughout dark atmospheric corridors littered with desiccated android corpses and threats around every corner. The neo-industrial setting, pixel visuals, and disturbing sounds create a feeling of deep apprehension. Unique and inventive with its approach, Signalis is a game for those that like alternative ideas.





 16  Sons Of The Forest (2023) 
Platforms: PC


 







  Sons of the Forest  


  Platform(s)    PC     Released    February 23, 2023     Developer(s)    Endnight Games     Genre(s)    Survival Horror    


  Website   Score    Steam   Very Positive    
Sons of the Forest was a smashing success when released in Early Access, selling 2 million copies in just 24 hours. Though it&#39;s yet to fully launch, the game can be played with friends online or solo and centers around collecting and crafting different items to uncover a disturbing mystery, revealing more facts about the mutated people on the island. As a survival horror title, it stands as one of the best first-person games that blends elements of open-world survival with &#34;hidden object&#34; horror titles. With a huge map to explore, varied enemy types, and hidden secrets and lore crammed in each location, the title improves virtually everything from The Forest.





 15  Phasmophobia (2020) 
Platforms: PC
        

  Phasmophobia  


  Platform(s)    PC     Released    September 18, 2020     Developer(s)    Kinetic Games     Genre(s)    Horror , Virtual Reality     Publisher(s)    Kinetic Games    


  Website   Score    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Phasmophobia is about as close to a real ghost-hunting experience as possible, tasking a group of other brave paranormal investigators with uncovering and identifying evil spirits found within haunted locations. Intense, creepy environments and bone-chilling audio immerse players in the role of a real ghost hunter. With a strong emphasis on creating a scary atmosphere, the game is incredibly frightening at times, especially when playing with the lights off. With very few true &#34;ghost hunting&#34; games in the horror genre, Phasmophobia stands as a triumph.





 14  Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! (2021) 
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, PS5, Xbox X/S
        

  Doki Doki Literature Club!  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC , Nintendo Switch     Released    June 30, 2021     Genre(s)    Horror     ESRB    g    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   83    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
A cult-classic anime title, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is certainly one of the odder games to those in the West. However, its shiny and friendly exterior gives way to a creepy core that completely subverts expectations with intense psychological horror. Embodying all aspects of a visual novel and dating sim, though the gameplay is somewhat basic compared to modern games, it makes up for its compelling story. The less that one knows about Doki Doki Literature Club before playing — the better.





 13  Returnal (2021) 
Platforms: PC, PS5
        

  Returnal  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , Microsoft Windows     Released    April 30, 2021     Developer(s)    Housemarque     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment     Genre(s)    Horror , Shooter , Roguelike     ESRB    T    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4/5    Metacritic   86    Steam   Very Positive    
As one of the most polished titles in the roguelike genre of games, Returnal is a surprisingly solid third-person horror title that takes cues from the indie games that helped inspire it. The deep and creepy story utilizes the popular roguelike genre within its core, as indicated by the game&#39;s on-the-nose title. As a result of this, Returnal is certainly more action-oriented than other horror games but makes up for it with monstrous creatures and vivid and diverse environments, which is critical considering its high difficulty and punishing gameplay mechanics. With a ton of skill and weapon variety, this is one of the more addictive horror games out right now.





 12  Resident Evil Village (2021) 
Platforms: PC, Mac, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, iOS 
  Resident Evil Village  


  Franchise    Resident Evil     Released    May 7, 2021     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   84    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Resident Evil Village follows the story of Ethan Winters, continuing the events of Resident Evil 7. Village has been praised for approaching the Resident Evil franchise in an action-focused way while maintaining the creepy and eerie scenarios and environments that catalyzed the franchise as an iconic of horror gaming. With fast-paced gameplay and terrifying enemies, the game still manages to bring the frights with one excruciatingly memorable scene in particular.





 11  Dredge (2023) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S, Nintendo Switch
        

  Dredge  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 30, 2023     Developer(s)    Black Salt Games     Publisher(s)    Team17     Genre(s)    Adventure , Simulation    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   80    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Dredge is a unique single-player fishing game where one is thrust into the shoes of a hapless captain who must dredge the sea bottom in search of treasure. With day and night cycles, many different Lovecraftian sea beasts, and plenty of lore to find, there&#39;s much more lurking under the surface of this indie title than meets the eye. Praised for its nuanced storytelling and creepy aesthetic, the game is certainly a unique but refreshing take on the horror game genre.





 10  Until Dawn (2015) 
Platforms: PS4
        

  Until Dawn  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4     Released    August 25, 2015     Developer(s)    Supermassive Games     Publisher(s)    Sony    


  Website   Score    Metacritic   79    IMDB   8.7    
Until Dawn stands as one of the earliest - and finest - examples of an interactive horror title, truly highlighting what was possible for the genre. Until Dawn lets players control - and save - eight teens, with different story branches depending on their decisions. With a star-studded cast including Academy Award-winning Rami Malek alongside Hayden Panettiere, the game walks the line between movie and game. With great graphics, amazing atmospheric audio, and a superb story, Until Dawn stands as a terrifying game, even by today&#39;s standards.





 9  Dead by Daylight (2016) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S


 







  Dead by Daylight  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PC , PlayStation 5 , Nintendo Switch , Xbox Series X , Xbox One , Stadia     Released    June 14, 2016     Developer(s)    Behaviour Interactive     Genre(s)    Multiplayer , Action , Survival Horror , Horror    


  Website   Score    Metacritic   71    Steam   Very Positive    
Dead by Daylight&#39;s impact on the genre is undeniable, inspiring a host of other multiplayer horrors like 2023&#39;s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and 2017&#39;s Friday the 13th: The Game. With frequent updates that include iconic killers like Pinhead from Hellraiser and, most recently, Chucky from Child&#39;s Play, the game has stayed highly relevant. While many have criticized some perceived balance issues, Dead by Daylight is a staple of the genre, particularly for those who enjoy playing games with friends, and horror movie buffs. Blending competitive gameplay, stealth, and the fear of being caught, there&#39;s no denying that Dead by Daylight is one of the most fun horror games people can play right now.





 8  Layers Of Fear (2023) 
Platforms: PC, Mac, PS5, Xbox Series X/S


 







  Layers of Fear (2023)  


  Franchise    Layers of Fear     Platform(s)    PC , macOS , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    June 15, 2023     Developer(s)    Bloober Team , Anshar Studios     Publisher(s)    Bloober Team    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   75    Steam   Mostly Positive    
Layers of Fear is a psychological horror game that pushes players to their limits with its decrepit, ever-changing world and interesting, albeit sometimes confusing, narrative. A sequel and remake to 2016&#39;s game of the same name, the immersive atmosphere raises the level of dread in this first-person horror game. Like many other puzzle-based horror titles, the game is not action or combat-oriented; instead, it opts for slower and methodical thrills. Showcasing a slow descent into madness, in Layers of Fear it&#39;s not a beast or monster one must be afraid of; the biggest threat is one&#39;s own mind.





 7  A Plague Tale: Requiem (2022) 
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch
        

  A Plague Tale Requiem  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    October 18, 2022     Developer(s)    Asobo Studio     Publisher(s)    Focus Entertainment    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   82    Steam   Very Positive    
A Plague Tale: Requiem is an action-adventure horror game and sequel to 2019&#39;s A Plague Tale: Innocence. The game follows the story of Amicia and Hugo de Rune as they flee the ever-looming horde of black plague-infested rats overrunning Southern France. The beautiful scenery of the French countryside is offset by the looming threat of the Inquisition and black plague as the game explores a sibling relationship set in beautiful environments with an award-winning score. Updates to combat and game mechanics make A Plague Tale: Requiem a unique title with a distinct and terrifying story that is also terrifying to play.





 6  Inscryption (2021) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S, Nintendo Switch


 







  Inscryption  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Nintendo Switch     Released    October 19, 2021     Developer(s)    Daniel Mullins Games     Genre(s)    Digital Card Game , Deckbuilding     Publisher(s)    Devolver Digital    


  Website   Score    Screen Rant   4/5    Metacritic   85    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Inscryption is a roguelike deckbuilding game that has been praised for its creative gameplay and cryptic, spooky atmosphere. With little to no direction and a retro pixel art style, the game is one of the most creative takes on the deckbuilding genre in some time. Sinister and highly intuitive in its approach, Inscryption manages to immerse players with its excellent storytelling, atmosphere, and sound design, making for a truly spooky and memorable experience. Screen Rant dubbed this Game of the Year back in 2021.
