# There May Never Be Another Official Zelda Timeline After TOTK


## SUMMARY 



  The Legend of Zelda&#39;s timeline is notoriously convoluted, and Tears of the Kingdom seems to contradict many aspects of it.   Certain characters and events in Tears of the Kingdom make it impossible to reconcile it with the existing franchise timeline.   It&#39;s unlikely there will ever be an update to the official Zelda timeline, simply because TOTK has made it too confusing.

## Literature Review

It seems impossible to place The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the franchise’s official timeline, vastly complicating any future updates.




With all of the changes that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom makes to the Zelda franchise’s famously complex timeline, it seems less likely than ever that there will be a proper update to the official chronology. Both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild make nostalgic references to the entirety of the franchise, but this also makes definitively placing them in the series timeline very difficult. Moreover, the story of TOTK seems to contradict several aspects of the previously established canon, complicating things even further.




As it stands, Nintendo’s official Zelda timeline, released after Skyward Sword, splits into three branches, each representing a different outcome of the events of Ocarina of Time. The Child and Adult Timelines respectively follow a Hyrule in which Link returns from the future to prevent Ganondorf’s plot, and the future version of the kingdom he consequently leaves bereft of a hero. Unusually for a game franchise, the third timeline branch, the Fallen Hero Timeline, also canonizes the possibility of Link’s death in OoT and its consequences. With conflicting references to these timelines, BOTW can reside at the end of all three branches concurrently. However, the timeline placement of TOTK itself is harder to understand.

 TOTK Does Not Fully Fit Into The Zelda Timeline 
          




Logically speaking, TOTK should simply be considered a sequel to BOTW, and consequently succeed the entirety of the franchise in the same way. However, much of the background story and plot established for TOTK is entirely new material, and by extension, seems to contradict this interpretation. For example, the Zonai are introduced in TOTK as the founders of Hyrule, but this conflicts with the state of affairs shown in Skyward Sword, which seems to imply that Hyrule was established by Hylians led by that game’s Link and Zelda. The existence of King Rauru seems to therefore contradict the existing canon timeline, making a coherent update of the existing timeline impossible.

By itself, there are several ways that this contradiction could be rationalized. For example, the Zonai’s Hyrule could actually be an older iteration of the kingdom that existed before the emergence of Demise and his war with Hylia, and so before the creation of Skyloft (although this conflicts with Ganon seemingly being a product solely of Demise&#39;s malice). Alternatively, it is also possible that Queen Sonia is a descendant of Skyward Sword’s Zelda (and thus most likely Link as well), and that Hyrule was not officially formed in the latter’s lifetime, although in this scenario the absence of the Zonai in Skyward Sword’s own sky is in itself notable.




On the other hand, it is just as simple to explain these issues with BOTW and TOTK representing an entirely new timeline, one which incorporates various aspects of previous games as myths and legends with little direct proof of veracity. However, the fact that Link can find armor sets based on several of his past incarnations and enemies in TOTK, as well as other artifacts like Majora’s Mask does at least suggest that at least some version of events from all three timelines occurred before the game. With that said, it seems little is remembered of these adventures by the time of BOTW and TOTK in any case.

 TOTK Can Only Exist In A Fully Reinterpreted Zelda Canon 
          

Beyond the existence of the Zonai, there is plenty of other evidence to suggest that TOTK exists in a new Zelda timeline. The Imprisoning War is a core part of the game’s plot, but this is not the first time that the term has been used; the same name is given to the conflict surrounding Ganon breaking into the Sacred Realm and claiming the Triforce prior to A Link to The Past, a saga seemingly depicted in Ocarina of Time. Interestingly, in both Imprisoning Wars, Ganon is sealed by a group of Sages after he acquired a potent magical artifact, although it is clear that they are different events.






Rauru also shares his name with the Hylian Sage of Light from Ocarina of Time.




Of course, using the same name for two distinct events is incredibly confusing when viewing the timeline as a whole, and further implies that not only the present events of TOTK, but also its distant past exist separately from the vast majority of Zelda games. It is difficult to see how an official timeline could present both Imprisoning Wars, let alone officially reconcile the appearance of the Zonai and their founding of Hyrule with Skyward Sword. The official Zelda timeline is already stated to be open to interpretation and change, and this seems to be the ultimate expression of that sentiment.

 TOTK’s Historical Implications Prevent The Zelda Timeline From Being Updated 
         




As it stands, Tears of the Kingdom simply does not make sense within the constraints of the official Zelda timeline, but at the same time, is clearly rooted in all that has come before it. Parts of the lore of TOTK, both explicit and implicit, are mutually exclusive with each other, making the game’s events and contents ever more paradoxical the closer they are examined. Because of this, it is unlikely that TOTK can ever be properly situated within the existing timeline without significant alterations to the established canon, and so could instead be considered to be part of a new canon within the greater franchise.

Understanding the Zelda timeline can be difficult even at the best of times, and both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom make doing so near impossible in their own ways. In particular, TOTK presents a version of Hyrule which seems impossible within the official timeline, but at the same time makes many clear references to prior games. With no clear way to reconcile these contradictions, it is extremely unlikely that there will ever be an update to the official timeline that definitively connects The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to the rest of the franchise.




               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017. A rare occurrence in Zelda titles, Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel instead of loosely connected. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link will take to the skies and learn about a mysterious kingdom in the clouds. Additionally, he will discover the secrets of the dark ones that dwell below and above the earth. The sequel is being built on the same engine as the original, with unique physics tools again being utilized. However, little about the plot and gameplay is known.
