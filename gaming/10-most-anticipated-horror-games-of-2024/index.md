## Literature Review

From slow-burning psychological horror to gore-filled breakneck action, there are plenty of horror titles releasing in 2024 to sink your teeth into.




It takes a certain type of person to truly revel in the frights and scares of a truly immersive horror game. Whether it&#39;s a psychological thriller like Alone in the Dark or player-choice, narrative-driven games like The Casting of Frank Stone, plenty of highly anticipated horror games are being released in 2024. While some of the new games come in the form of known and loved franchises or as reboots of iconic titles like The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, other games are creating wholly unique and new worlds for players to explore and experiment in.
Those with a penchant for blood and gore and don&#39;t mind a bit of violence, enjoy the thrills of hectic chases down dark corridors, or just genuinely enjoy the horror genre for the emotional ups and downs it can elicit will not be left wanting. Though a game like Slitterhead is a highly-anticipated title with iconic developers involved in its creation, games without an official release window won&#39;t be included.
            
 
 25 Best Horror Games To Play Right Now 
From demonic entities to sadistic killers, there&#39;s so much to choose from for horror game fans. Here are 25 of the best horror titles available.












 








 10  Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game (2024) 
Platforms: PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox One &amp; X/S


 







Though it&#39;s arguable whether Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game will be a good asymmetrical horror game, it is a title based on a beloved cult-classic horror film from 1988. Only time will tell whether it can capture the audiences that enjoy games like Dead by Daylight or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the strong IP and familiar clowns give this title some needed anticipation. Similar to its source material, Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game looks to be a wackier, more slapstick affair than other dark horror titles more rooted in reality.





 9  Tormented Souls 2 (2024) 
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox X/S
        

A long-awaited sequel to the original game with the same name, Tormented Souls 2, was announced at Gamescom 2023 to great fanfare from those who played the original. If Tormented Souls 2 is anything like the first game, it&#39;s destined to be a gritty, surreal experience filled with dark and horrifying atmosphere and mystery. Reminiscent of the original Resident Evil titles with a much greater emphasis on puzzle solving, much of what holds the first game back is its technical limitations, something the sequel can remedy.
Tormented Souls 2 will follow the story of Caroline Walker as she desperately attempts to rescue her cursed sister. 






 8  Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden (February 13, 2024) 
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox X/S
        

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an upcoming immersive-action RPG set in a vivid and horrific world filled with otherworldy beasts, vengeful spirits, and ominous curses. Set in the late 1600s, the game follows two lovers and ghost hunters who set out to protect people from deadly ghosts and spirits that roam the town of New Eden. With divergent story arcs and what looks to be high-paced and compelling gameplay, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is one to look out for for those who enjoy action horror games.





 7  The Casting Of Frank Stone (2024)

Though The Casting of Frank Stone may not be known to those who don&#39;t play Behaviour Interactive&#39;s Dead by Daylight, every horror fan should know about the upcoming single-player horror title. Developed in collaboration with Supermassive Games, the same devs that created The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone is a creepy narrative horror tale set inside the macabre Dead by Daylight universe. Like other Supermassive titles, decisions will decide the fate of a group of hapless teenagers, leading to divergent storylines and unique endings.

 6  Alone In The Dark (March 20, 2024) 
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox X/S


 







  Alone in the Dark (2024)  


  Franchise    Alone in the Dark     Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    January 16, 2024     Developer(s)    Pieces Interactive     Publisher(s)    THQ Nordic     Genre(s)    Action , Survival Horror     ESRB    M    


A Southern Gothic psychological thriller, Alone in the Dark is a new survival horror game and a re-imagining of the original 1992 game of the same name. Like the original story, the new Alone in the Dark will follow the story of 1920s private detective Edward Carnby (played by David Harbour) and Emily Hardwood (played by Jodie Comer) as they unlock the mysteries behind a cursed location. A blending of the works of H.R. Giger and H.P. Lovecraft, Alone in the Dark is a true love letter to noir-style detective thrillers with a horror-thriller twist.

 5  Little Nightmares 3 (2024) 
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox One &amp; X/S
        

  Little Nightmares 3  


  Franchise    Little Nightmares     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Developer(s)    Supermassive Games     Publisher(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment     Genre(s)    Adventure , Horror , Platformer     ESRB    Not Yet Rated    


Yet another sequel to a wildly popular game, Little Nightmares 3, will pick up where the second puzzle-platformer left off but will feature two new characters, Low and Alone. Taking place in a 2.5D world, the game will finally contain online co-op, which makes sense considering the teamwork features in the game and the fact there are two main protagonists. Though not the most realistically horrifying franchise, the stylish dark aesthetic and compelling gameplay make this a horror title suited for a wide range of audiences.





 4  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl (Q1 2024) 
Platforms: PC
        

  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl  


  Franchise    S.T.A.L.K.E.R.     Platform(s)    PC , Xbox Series X/S     Developer(s)    GSC Game World     Publisher(s)    GSC Game World     Genre(s)    First-Person Shooter , Survival Horror     ESRB    Rating Pending    


S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is the highly-anticipated sequel to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. released in 2007, and will feature the same mysterious, creeping, and often horrifying story of discovery while navigating the horrors created by the fallout from the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. A blend of first-person shooting, survival horror, and simulation, the upcoming title has been highly anticipated by those who have played the first game, and for good reason.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl has seen several development and production delays, as the game&#39;s developers, GSC Game World, based out of Ukraine, have been the unfortunate targets of cyberattacks and have been affected by war in the region. That said, it looks like the survival horror title will finally get a proper release in the early months of 2024, though no hard date has been officially set.

 3  Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 (Fall 2024) 
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox X/S


 







Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a highly-anticipated title nearly 20 years in the making, as the original came out in 2004 and quickly gained a cult following. The original Bloodlines put people in the shoes of a night-stalking vampire in a semi-open world RPG with a ton of character customization and progression, enabling people to create everything from a smooth-operating romancer to a grotesque Nosferatu-like creature.
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will place the protagonist in the center of an all-out vampire civil war as an elder vampire looking to claim power for themselves in modern-day Seattle. With updated graphics, a new narrative and story, and a host of new abilities, hopefully, the new title will also boast the same player-choice options that made the original so popular.
The first Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines was developed by Troika Games and published by Activision, while the sequel will be developed by The Chinese Room and published by Paradox Interactive. 






 2  Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2 (2024) 
Platforms: PC, Xbox X/S
        

Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is the much-anticipated follow-up to the highly-praised Hellblade: Senua&#39;s Sacrifice from 2017. An action-adventure horror title, the original Hellblade was an intense, psychological thriller with monstrous abominations and plenty of gore, and the sequel promises to follow up in glorious form. Following the events after the first title, the game will again follow Senua as she navigates dangerous open areas, solves complex puzzles, and fights against the dark creatures infesting her mind. Announced at The Game Awards 2023, the original title was a fascinating and terrifying look at mental health and trauma.





 1  Silent Hill 2 Remake (2024) 
Platforms: PC, PS5


 







  Silent Hill 2 Remake  


  Franchise    Silent Hill     Platform(s)    PlayStation 5     Developer(s)    Bloober Team     Publisher(s)    Konami     Genre(s)    Survival Horror     ESRB    M    


Though there&#39;s been a ton of hype since the Silent Hill 2 Remake was originally announced in the fall of 2022, not much has been revealed about the remake of the iconic horror game from 2001. A rejuvenation of the franchise, the game is being produced by Motoi Okamoto of Konami while the creature designer of the original title, Masahiro Ito, and composer Akira Yamaoka has returned to work on the remake of the game. Like the original Silent Hill 2, the remake will follow closely with the original story of James Sunderland on the hunt to find his wife after receiving a mysterious letter.
