## Literature Review

One simple change should come as a welcome relief in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria by cutting down on a lot of stumbling around in the dark.




Some resources in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria can be much harder to acquire than others, but one that could potentially cause frustration has received a change that should alleviate problems. As a survival crafting game, Return to Moria employs properly balancing resources as part of the intended challenge. When things don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re shaking out in a fun or fair way, however, a little bit of tweaking can go a long way to ensure that the experience is rewarding without feeling like a grind or a dead end.




Problems with The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria resources tended to arise with ones that are fundamentally essential, where it can become impossible to progress without enough of a supply. While some necessary assets like food can be sourced in completely sustainable ways, others can dry up much more quickly. One such example lies in Return to Moria&#39;s Black Diamonds, which are most easily found in the chests at orc camps. Although some can also be acquired in the Dark Depths, this particular avenue can be terrifying and difficult to explore, as well as somewhat mystifying to uncover.

                  The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria   It&#39;s not exactly mithril, but there&#39;s still some solid ore to be found for Dwarves of more modest ambition in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.

Orcs don&#39;t always leave their Black Diamonds locked away in chests, but the rarity of actually getting significant quantities in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria mob drops made fighting orc hordes for Black Diamonds a largely futile task. Patch 1.0.2, available on the official Return to Moria website, addresses this by increasing the Black Diamond drop rate as part of a general focus on increased rewards for combat. Taking down trolls and Nameless Beasts now guarantees a Black Diamond as well, offering some actual motivation to take down a big lug beside them being in the way.

Wanting everything to be easier can sometimes be a tempting proposition, but in changes that add convenience to a challenging game have to be well-considered to maintain its interest. In this case, making Black Diamonds just a little more available is a smart one, alleviating what felt like an undue dependence on this one particular resource and offering an extra incentive to take on enemies. Progression requirements that need large quantities of Black Diamond could force a party otherwise prepared to move on to run through every corner searching for missed orc encampments while fighting orcs in the wild could feel pointless and tiring without much hope for this true treasure.
