## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Patch 4 makes another round of fixes to the game, and taking a glance at the best ones shows just how much has changed.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Patch 4 represents another major batch of fixes for the expansive roleplaying game, and some of the changes stand out as the most essential. Although the game launched as an impressive title, its complex branching nature and enormous scope has seen a fair share of bugs and issues as a consequence. Each patch has brought the game closer to its ideal form, and Patch 4 is no exception to the record so far.
The list of items for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Patch 4 is as long as ever, and the Steam announcement for the patch abridges things somewhat from the beefy breakdown available on the website of developer Larian Studios. Even so, it can be easy for some major changes to get lost among a still-long list of alterations. These tweaks affect everything from basic gameplay to nuances of story flow. Issues present in Act 3 have generated criticism calling it the worst part of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and it receives the biggest dose of assistance in the new patch.




























 








 10  Outfitting Your Statue 
Patch 4 Adds Three Options To Tav&#39;s Statue
        

Act 3 offers the protagonist an opportunity to be commemorated in statue form, but it was all too easy to ruin Tav&#39;s immortalization in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The statue&#39;s appearance would be based on the protagonist at the exact moment of purchase, making it easy to end up with goofy clothing or inappropriate equipment. The patch notes available on the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 website reveal that choices are now offered to have the statue opt for full equipment, camp outfit, or, for the most adventurous, no clothes whatsoever, letting everyone get what they want out of the statue a little more easily.





 9  Customizing Hirelings 
A Hireling&#39;s Appearance Can Be Changed Upon Recruitment


 







Hirelings have received a number of updates over the course of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 patches, and Patch 4 is no exception. It&#39;s now possible to customize Hirelings&#39; appearance when hiring them, making it so no party need be accused of traveling with hangers-on who don&#39;t befit their style. This follows up on the Magic Mirror&#39;s Patch 3 addition making it possible to select their look through the same system as tweaking the appearance of a custom character.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.









 8  Potion Of Mind Reading Color 
Now A Different Color Than Potion Of Healing
        

Another minor tweak that could provide a surprising amount of relief is a change to the Potion of Mind Reading. This particular vial looked all too similar to a Potion of Healing at a glance, so it could be easy to accidentally grab the wrong one during combat. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Patch 4 tweaks the color to reduce the resemblance, which is sure to vastly reduce the amount of confusion and regret that the potion has been known to incur.





 7  More Autosaves 
More Frequent Autosave Triggers In Act 2 &amp; 3
        

Losing progress in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can be devastating, as it may mean retracing some complex steps or difficult encounters. The ability to save at essentially any time largely negates this threat, but forgetting to do so might have dire consequences. Patch 4 adds additional autosave points to the Shadow-Cursed Lands in Act 2 and Wyrm&#39;s Crossing and the Lower City in Act 3, further reducing the likelihood of incurring this frustration and better matching the autosave frequency of Act 1.

 6  Cleaning Characters 
Sponges &amp; Soap Now Have A Gameplay Function


 







Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 doesn&#39;t shy away from blood and filth, often splashing party members with the appropriate substances when close-range combat or muddy encounters make it relevant. Sponges and soaps gain functional life in Patch 4, now making it possible to freshen up when the need presents itself. This doesn&#39;t change any core function of the game, but it can be nice for those who want to take some cute screenshots of Astarion and find it frustrating that he isn&#39;t looking his best.





 5  Withers&#39; Wardrobe Improvements 
Withers Now Explains How To Get Rid Of Unwanted Co-Op Comapnions
        

Withers&#39; Wardrobe was a previous Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 fix, making it possible to remove the avatars of co-op friends from a party so that play alone wasn&#39;t hampered. As a quick response to complaints rather than a launch feature, however, the implementation wasn&#39;t entirely what it could be. Patch 4 improves that by having Withers actually explain the feature to ensure that no one ends up confused and adding the option to dismiss dead avatars to the wardrobe.





 4  Scratch&#39;s Behavior 
Scratch Will Fetch More Than Just His Ball
        

Scratch may not have quite the same presence in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 as some of the major party members and antagonists, but this friendly canine certainly has no trouble winning hearts. Patch 4 makes recruiting him to camp more exciting than ever with some adjustments to his willingness to fetch items. While it was best to stick to the designated ball in the past, he&#39;s now willing to go for &#34;pretty much everything,&#34; which should no doubt lead to some fun (and adorable) experimentation.





 3  Holding End Turn 
Turns Can Accidentally Be Ended By Tapping Triangle On PS5
        

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 goes through some effort to make playing a game intended for mouse and keyboard go down smoothly on a controller, but playing this way can still have certain sticking points. Patch 4 addresses a major one by adding the option to change the End Turn trigger to holding a button instead of tapping it, making it easier to avoid mistakenly moving on from a character. A single action can sometimes make all the difference in a difficult battle, so this is a fairly significant quality of life improvement.

 2  Idle Animations 
New Animations To Make The Party&#39;s Camp More Lively


 







Camp in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is always a welcome safe haven, but it does become awfully familiar after enough time spent in the game. Patch 4 tosses some new idle animations into the mix to liven things up, with Minthara, Halsin, Shadowheart, and Lae&#39;zel being the lucky recipients. Karlach in particular is also singled out for general idle improvements in camp, citing her tendency to stand still in a way that never reflected her lively character.

 1  Color Blind Settings 
New Accessibility Options To Help With Protanopia, Deuteranopia, &amp; Tritanopia
        

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 receives a major boost in accessibility features with Patch 4 thanks to settings for three different types of color blindness - protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. These change the colors used for major points of necessary distinction, like the lineup of character portraits in battle and icons on the minimap. As combat in particular can require keeping track of many disparate elements, offering a clearer way for those with color blindness to do so is a huge step forward that will no doubt help many enjoy Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to its fullest.
