## Literature Review

Iron Bundle will receive the next Mightiest Mark with its upcoming 7 Star Ice-Tera Type Raid for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet in December 2023.





To connect to the 7-Star Iron Bundle Tera Raid, you must have internet access. There will then be a black sparkling Ice-Tera Symbol, which you must reach to begin the raid. If the raid starts with just your Pokémon, it will fill the team with NPCs, which is handy if you want to solo the raid. 






Like most 7-Star Tera Raid formats, the Academy Ace Tournament is part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s postgame. Then, after defeating four, or five-star raids ten times, Jacq will call you to start 6-star Tera Raids.





 Iron Bundle&#39;s Moveset 
          

Considering which moves Iron Bundle will use during its 7-Star Tera Raid in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will be crucial. For example, every mighty Tera-Raid Pokémon will begin with set-up moves such as weather effects, terrain, or stat changes to itself or your Pokémon. 



The next stage of the battle will be an attacking phase where Iron Bundle might be able to attack twice in one turn. Bring a protective Pokémon against Ice-type or Water-type moves, as most of its attacks will come from those types. 







Finally, most of these mighty mark Pokémon will also have countering moves that the Pokémon can learn but will be extremely strong against many Pokémon that are brought into the battle. The full list of potential moves Iron Bundle can use can be found on Serebii.net.



 Iron Bundle&#39;s Stats &amp; Ribbon 
          

7-Star Tera Raids in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have some of the strongest stats and levels. Iron Bundle is no different, as it will likely be level 100, meaning its Special Attack will have 124 base points with full Individual Values. As for its Pokémon Type, Ice-type Pokémon have only four weaknesses and no resistance.

  Pokémon   Level   Base Type   Tera Type   Ribbons/Marks   Main Stats    Iron Bundle   100   Ice- and Water-type   Ice-type   Mightiest Mark     Special Attack   Speed      








 Best Team To Beat Iron Bundle 
          

Due to Iron Bundle being a Tera-Type Ice in Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet, consider the following Pokémon for battle:

 Pokémon  Typing &amp; Moves   Gholdengo  Ghost-/Steel-typing with resistance and access to powerful Steel-type moves.   Hisuian Goodra  Dragon-/Steel-typing with resistance to Water-type moves and high Special Defense   Iron Hands  Electric-/Fighting-typing with super-effective moves and gets a free boost if Iron Bundle uses Electric Terrain from its ability, Quark Drive.   Annihilape  Fighting-/Ghost-typing, which can be trained with high special defense, uses Drain Punch to restore its health to full, and the ability Defiant, which can raise its Attack stat if Iron Bundle uses Chilling Water on this Pokémon to inflict stat lowering.   





 Rewards For Beating Iron Bundle 
          




The Iron Bundle 7-Star Tera Raid in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will reward you with general EXP items and Tera shards. The shards specifically will be Ice-type, meaning you can change a Pokémon&#39;s Tera Type to Ice if there are 50 individual shards. Due to Iron Bundle&#39;s top two stats being Special Attack and Speed, an item that you will also potentially see will be Carbos, which is used for EV training, making your Pokémon faster.
