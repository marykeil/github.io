## Literature Review

Players can cast the Meta Quest 2’s content to a TV so that they can share the experience with other people in the same room.





It is worth pointing out that the video cast on the TV will be slightly compressed and won’t be true 3D like in the Meta Quest 2 headset. However, it will be clear enough so that everyone in the room can see what you will be experiencing in the headset. To get started with the Casting process, make sure you have setup your Meta Quest 2 before proceeding. Then, check whether your TV supports Google Chromecast or AirPlay for Apple TV screen mirroring.

 How To Cast Meta Quest 2 or The Meta Quest Pro To a TV 
          

The Meta Quest 2 can be cast to various devices; however, to get it to work with the TV, you need to ensure that your TV supports the Chromecast or Casting feature. Most recent Smart TVs have this option built-in, and it should work when the TV is turned on. Follow the below steps to Cast your Meta Quest 2&#39;s content to the TV:

  Download the Meta Quest mobile app to your phone.   Ensure the Meta Quest 2, your smartphone, and the TV are on the same Wi-Fi network.   Ensure all three devices are logged into the same Meta account.   Open the Oculus menu by pressing the Oculus/Meta button on the right-hand controller.   Select Camera, then select the “Cast” option.   Select Computer or Meta Quest mobile app to begin casting.   A list of devices should appear, showing your TV and other options on your phone.   Select your TV and click Next.  




The contents of your Meta Quest 2 should appear on your TV after the above process has been completed. If your TV does not appear in the list of devices for casting, it is possible that your TV does not support the feature. You can circumvent this issue by adding a Chromecast device to your TV’s HDMI port and selecting it as the casting device. If you have one nearby, you can also cast your Meta Quest 2 to a PC or a Laptop so that your friends and family can view your gameplay.
