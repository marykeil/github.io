# Baldur s Gate 3 Just Made One Major Choice Way Less Appealing


## SUMMARY 



  Patch 5 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 introduces a new epilogue, which offers more closure for Lae&#39;zel.   Lae&#39;zel&#39;s hidden epilogue is tied to the githyanki egg quest, and is easily missed because of certain choices provided to the player through dialog.   Lae&#39;zel&#39;s journey in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is difficult but transformative, and she deserves the happy ending provided by this epilogue after facing uncomfortable truths throughout the game.

## Literature Review

Patch 5 added a secret epilogue for Lae’zel among its many changes, and it makes a major choice at the end of Act 1 worth skipping completely.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has added another batch of content and tons of fixes for bugs and glitches in Patch 5, including a new epilogue to provide closure for the game&#39;s characters and endings for side quests that were otherwise left hanging. But the addition of an epilogue has brought with it new revelations about choices made regarding companions. And one in particular makes it worth ignoring a certain choice in exchange for the happiest ending for a character who has a rough time throughout the campaign with revelations that come to light about their culture.




Choices made in Act 1 don&#39;t always have immediate consequences, and there&#39;s one decision that&#39;s made near its end by parties that go into the Mountain Pass to get to the Shadow-Cursed Lands. The group comes across a researcher named Lady Esther who wants a githyanki egg for research purposes. Usually the options are to give her the actual githyanki egg, swap it out with an owlbear egg, or just not complete the quest. However, there&#39;s another option that the githyanki egg can be used for, and it might be the best choice.


 The Githyanki Egg Should Be Given To Lae&#39;zel 
         

One option that&#39;s often overlooked is the choice to give the githyanki egg to Lae&#39;zel. One reason this possibility ends up overlooked likely has to do with the option not being in dialogue choices. Tav doesn&#39;t get to suggest that Lae&#39;zel take the egg. Instead, this option requires taking control of Lae&#39;zel and taking the egg out of a chest if it&#39;s stored there, or sending it to her inventory if another character is carrying it. Then, it&#39;s a matter of leaving it there throughout the rest of the game. No wonder this leads to a secret epilogue, given how subtle the requirements are to get it.






Many players miss out on the Mountain Pass because the game provides a message claiming the story will advance if the party travels there. However, the Mountain Pass does not begin Act 2, and players are able to travel back to the Act 1 region from the Mountain Pass.




However, the payoff of taking these steps is well worth it, and the githyanki in the egg ends up with a much better life than he would&#39;ve had in the hands of the researchers. At Withers&#39; party in the new epilogue added in Patch 5, Tav can ask Lae&#39;zel if the egg hatched. She responds that he has hatched, and she can tell that he&#39;ll grow up to be a fine man. The joy in her expressions and voice is clear when she talks about Xan, the githyanki she&#39;s raising. His importance to her is even shown in the name she gave him, as it means &#34;freedom,&#34; which is something she was only able to gain herself with the help of the party.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: You Shouldn&#39;t Skip The Githyanki Crèche Questline   The Githyanki Crèche questline in Baldur’s Gate 3 is part of Lae’zel’s companion quest, but it offers plenty of information to discover.   






 Lae&#39;zel Is The Type Of Mother The Githyanki Need 
          

The githyanki are a very militaristic people, and they gave themselves the mission of eradicating illithid threats. When romancing Lae&#39;zel, the way she describes partnerships and bonds among the githyanki sounds cold. Everything seems to be based on strength and fighting in her culture, but Lae&#39;zel learns about the importance of bonds through the adventures of BG3, and she even thanks Tav for essentially broadening her views. And that changes the views that she&#39;ll impart to Xan.


 

When talking to Lae&#39;zel about Xan, she says that he&#39;ll make a great warrior. However, she also mentions that he doesn&#39;t have to become a warrior if he doesn&#39;t want to. She wants to give him the freedom to make his own choices and be anything he wants, and that&#39;s because she was able to start making choices regardless of Vlaakith after the party helped her uncover Vlaakith&#39;s manipulation and lies. Given how happy Lae&#39;zel is, it seems like the Githyanki could use more people like her who respect other races and the option of choosing what path to take in life.






 Lae&#39;zel&#39;s Journey In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Is Particularly Difficult 
          

For years, Lae&#39;zel put her full faith in Vlaakith. She believed everything she was taught by her people, and then she was abducted by a Nautiloid and infected with an illithid tadpole, which is arguably the worst event that can happen to a githyanki with their mission to eradicate the illithid. Her aggressive attitude doesn&#39;t make it easy for her to win allies, but looking closer, she has the best interest of the party at heart when she keeps insisting that they head to the githyanki crèche. It&#39;s the only way she knows how to solve the tadpole problem, and she&#39;s willing to share that solution with the group.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Finally Makes One Beloved Character Canon (But It&#39;s Easy To Miss)   A tiny NPC from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons one-shot with the Baldur’s Gate 3 cast has now joined the game’s canon in the most unexpected but wonderful way.   




Arriving at the crèche only results in more problems for Lae&#39;zel. She learns that there&#39;s no cure for the altered parasite the party has been infected with, and she has to deal with the realization that Vlaakith, who she saw as a god-like figure, has been lying to the githyanki, with their true prince trapped in the Astral Prism. Not only that, but Vlaakith sets up an ambush to kill them, so they can&#39;t take away the power she stole. It&#39;s one revelation after another, and they all challenge Lae&#39;zel&#39;s worldview. As a result, the party&#39;s journey is incredibly difficult for her, but she uses it to become a better person.



 Lae&#39;zel Deserves A Happy Ending 
          

After a rough journey, Lae&#39;zel deserves a happy ending. She had to face no shortage of uncomfortable truths, but instead of going into denial, she worked to set things right for her people and improve herself. Then, in the epilogue, it&#39;s clear that she&#39;s happy and proud to be raising the hatchling, and she&#39;s glad that she&#39;s able to give him more choices in life than she had. And that makes it seem like this is the best possible ending for Lae&#39;zel - an opportunity to raise the next generation in a way that prevents them from making the same mistakes she did.




Not everybody has a happy ending, but avoiding a major choice near the end of Act 1 and instead giving the githyanki egg to Lae&#39;zel can contribute to her receiving the best possible ending. Her abrasive attitude might not make her the most loved companion, but her arc has a lot of character growth for those who go through it. As such, it&#39;s nice that Patch 5 added a secret epilogue for Lae&#39;zel that gives her happiness after the events of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
