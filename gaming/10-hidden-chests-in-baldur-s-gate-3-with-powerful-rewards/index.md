## Literature Review

Not every hidden chest in Baldur’s Gate 3 holds good—or useful—rewards, but there are some that are worth hunting down for their powerful prizes.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a sizable map divided across three acts and several locations. Naturally, that means there are plenty of hidden treasures to find both in buildings or in the wild. However, some treasure chests hold better rewards than others, and those rewards might not always take the form of armor or weapons.
Chests are abundant in Faerûn, but it&#39;s rare for them to contain worthwhile rewards. Instead, they tend to have gold, resources like Trap Disarm Kits, or camp clothes and supplies. At worst, they&#39;ll have rotten food or nothing at all. Specific chests with unique names, however, are hidden in the world, and they often hold the best rewards. As such, they also tend to require the most effort to find and open.




























 








 10  Chest Of The Mundane In The Underdark 
Contains Mystra&#39;s Grace
        

The Chest of the Mundane would&#39;ve ranked higher in its pre-patch form, but updates have taken its most powerful feature and removed it since that was never an intended feature. Previously, the Chest of the Mundane was the closest to a Bag of Holding that BG3 had, reducing the weight of items added to it so that characters could carry way more in their inventory than they were meant to. Now, the chest simply holds Mystra&#39;s Grace (which allow the wearer to cast feather fall as a bonus action), two random scrolls, and another random item.





 9  Dror Ragzlin&#39;s Pile Of Chests In The Shattered Sanctum 
Contains Helmet Of Grit, Springstep Boots, &amp; Amulet Of Selûne&#39;s Chosen
        

Behind Dror&#39;s throne room is a locked balcony full of gold and treasure chests. Defeating Dror drops the key to access this hoard, but it&#39;s also possible to lockpick the gate open and take the loot after completing the cutscene where the party speaks with a Mind Flayer corpse as part of his ritual. The party will walk away with up to 500 gold, Helmet of Grit, Springstep Boots, and Amulet of Selûne&#39;s Chosen as a reward.





 8  The Missing Shipment On The Risen Road 
Grants Access To The Zhentarim Basement
        

The real reward isn&#39;t in the missing shipment itself, and all it holds are a few pieces of loot that aren&#39;t exactly powerful, but the prize is what it unlocks when left unopened. The shipment allows the party access to the Zhentarim basement in BG3, which gives them the chance to trade with the merchant there. Additionally, this quest continues through Act 3, meaning that it gives the party experience and more rewards for taking the option to deliver the missing shipment instead of opening it for the rather mundane loot inside.





 7  Kagha&#39;s Chest In The Druid Grove 
Starts A Hidden Quest
        

This is another chest where the reward isn&#39;t from the items themselves, but from the consequences of collecting them. Kagha&#39;s Chest is locked and hidden behind some bookcases, but lockpicking it leads the party on a quest to discover that Kagha is working with Shadow Druids and trying to hand control of the Grove to them while Halsin&#39;s a Goblin prisoner. This option gives more experience to the party, and stops the Rite of Thorns without stealing the Sacred Idol and leading to a lot of fighting between the Druids and Tieflings.





 6  Gilded Chest Of Selûne In The Owlbear Cave 
Contains A Bloodstone &amp; The Moondrop Pendant


 







The Gilded Chest of Selûne is one of the earlier chests the party can find and open in the Owlbear Cave of Act 1. Opening it requires finding a prayer sheet and choosing to read it next to the chest. However, having a Cleric of Selûne in the party means they can open it just from interacting with the chest. The item in the chest worth grabbing aside from the Bloodstone is the Moondrop Pendant, which prevents enemies from taking Opportunity Attacks on the wearer when they have less than 50% health.





 5  Chest In The House In Deep Shadows 
Contains The Ring Of Mental Inhibition
        

This chest is much more hidden than the others and seems innocuous with its lack of unique name. However, finding this locked chest in the Deep Shadows region of Act 2 on the second floor of an abandoned house rewards the party with the Ring of Mental Inhibition. With this ring, enemies that fail a Saving Throw against the wearer&#39;s spells or actions are inflicted with Mental Fatigue for two turns.





 4  Offering Chest Under The Stormshore Tabernacle 
Contains The Amulet Of The Devout
        

Under the Stormshore Tabernacle in Act 3, there&#39;s a set of offering chests for the various deities worshiped there. The one that&#39;s alone in the middle of the room, and also the largest chest, contains the Amulet of the Devout, which gives a character with the Channel Divinity ability an extra charge of it. The biggest downside is being cursed for stealing from an offering chest, but that&#39;s easily remedied with Remove Curse or by using a Hireling to grab the amulet and abandoning them after.





 3  Vault 9 In The Counting House 
Contains The Elegant Studded Leather
        

The Counting House in Act 3 has a room of vaults, and the keys to them can be obtained through quests or killing enemies who are bosses or important in questlines. Normally, the key to Vault 9 is a reward for finding and returning the gold that the Stone Lord stole, but lockpicking it ahead of time and stealing the Elegant Studded Leather has no negative consequences. The Elegant Studded Leather&#39;s great on a rogue with its &#43;2 to Initiative Rolls, Advantage on Stealth Checks, and a free use of Shield.





 2  Vault Chest Under Sorcerous Sundries 
Contains Foebreaker


 







The vaults under Sorcerous Sundries in Act 3 for Gale&#39;s quest are confusing, and it&#39;s easy to keep going in circles. Finding this chest requires See Invisibility, and rewards the party with Foebreaker. Foebreaker&#39;s a Very Rare Maul that ignores bludgeoning damage, which can be useful depending on the enemy types the party&#39;s fighting.





 1  Akabi&#39;s Prize Chest At Circus Of The Last Days 
Contains Nyrulna


 







Nyrulna&#39;s the best Legendary Weapon in BG3, and it&#39;s hidden inside a chest in Act 3. Getting Nyrulna requires the party to stop Akabi&#39;s cheating with the wheel, letting them win the grand prize. As it turns out, the prize is locked in a chest in a distant jungle that Akabi teleports a party member to in his anger at no longer being able to cheat. Considering the strength of the weapon, obtaining Nyrulna is rather straightforward.
With a game that allows as much exploration as BG3, it&#39;s not surprising that there are chests filled with hidden treasures throughout the acts. However, not every chest holds treasure, and those that do can be easy to miss, like Nyrulna being hidden behind winning Akabi&#39;s wheel. But it shows that it&#39;s important to go slowly through Faerûn to find as many powerful treasures and hidden chests as possible in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
