 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
January 17th #942
          




The January 17th Wordle answer is COURT.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which provided an incorrect placement for &#39;R&#39; and &#39;T&#39;. These letters were shuffled a bit for our second guess ROTTY, but this only showed us more incorrect placements and added a correctly located &#39;O&#39;.

Moving forward we tried TOURS as our third attempt which locked in quite a lot of letters and left us with only one empty space. We were quick to score our Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer, COURT. After our loss on Monday, it&#39;s nice to see a winning streak evolving again.
