## Literature Review

The special livestream program for Genshin Impact&#39;s Version 4.4 should be occurring soon, as the game progresses further into Version 4.3.




The date of the Genshin Impact 4.4 livestream is nearly arriving as the live-service game by HoYoverse progresses further into Version 4.3. The next patch should arrive in late January if the regular six-week schedule in Genshin Impact is to be taken into consideration and, based on that, it is possible to predict when the livestream will occur. The livestream is a special program that showcases the content that is being added with the next update. This includes an exhibition of the new characters and their gameplay abilities, a roundup of the story content and the planned events, as well as quality-of-life updates being implemented.




If the many Version 4.4 leaks are to be believed, there is a lot of content planned for the next patch, even if it does not develop more into the main Fontaine storyline, which came to a halt with Version 4.2. HoYoverse has already confirmed two new playable characters, while leaks address new areas in Genshin Impact 4.4. There are also rumors about new skins for some beloved characters, as well as a skin selector device that allows players to select a free character skin for themselves. There are a lot of rumors and, if they are true, all this content should be shown in the Version 4.4 livestream.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   


 Date &amp; Time - Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream 
          




Because of the game’s six-week schedule, it is possible to predict that Version 4.4 is due to arrive on January 31, considering Version 4.3 was released on December 20. With livestreams usually occurring two weeks prior, on Fridays, it is safe to assume that the 4.4 livestream will occur on January 19, on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch. The exact time has yet to be confirmed by HoYoverse, but considering previous events, it will likely happen at some point in the morning. Again, this date is speculative based on the developer’s prior behavior and may be inaccurate in case there are any unexpected delays.



The developer should confirm the exact date and time of the livestream a few days before it actually happens. This article will be updated once that occurs to reflect the correct information.






 What To Expect From Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream - New Characters &amp; Banners 
         




Based on official information and leaks alike, it is possible to determine what may be shown during the special event for the upcoming patch. One of the main new additions is Cloud Retainer’s release in Genshin Impact 4.4. Going by the name Xianyun, this adepti has been confirmed as a playable character by the developer. According to the leaks, Xianyun is a 5-star Anemo unit that operates as both a support and sub-DPS. She is said to use a Catalyst in battle. The human version of Cloud Retainer had been somewhat presented during 2023’s Lantern Rite Festival but through an animation rather than an in-game sprite.

In addition to Xianyun, Version 4.4 should present yet another new character. This hero is called Gaming and he is expected to be a 4-star unit. Gaming has a Pyro Vision and, as pointed out by leaks, uses a claymore in battle. The leaks, such as the ones by HXG shared in a now-deleted post on Reddit, mention that Gaming will be a main DPS unit that excels in plunging attacks – much like Xiao. In fact, Xiao’s rerun is set for Genshin Impact 4.4, and it makes a lot of sense considering that the leaks talk about how 5-star Anemo DPS works very well with Xianyun.




The other two reruns, leaked by DimBreath and shared on Reddit, are Nahida and Yae Miko. According to the most recent information Phase 1 banners will be composed of Xianyun’s debut and Nahida’s rerun, with Yae Miko and Xiao rerunning in Phase 2 banners. This seems like a point of interest, as there are still a lot of conflicting leaks about the exact order of the banners. Previous leaks mentioned Xianyun and Xiao being paired up, which made for the perfect perfect Phase 1 banners in Genshin Impact 4.4. Because of how varied these leaks are, players should take these with a grain of salt.



Banner structures are subject to change ahead of each Version’s release, so it is best to wait for the official confirmation by HoYoverse. There were previous cases of leaks indicating certain character reruns, only for players to be surprised by the developer’s announcement of a different character rerun.






 What To Expect From Genshin Impact 4.4 Livestream - Story Updates, Events, &amp; More 
          




While playable characters tend to be the most interesting part of any update, it seems like there will be a lot of playable content in the upcoming patch. It is unlikely that there will be any main story content in the form of Archon Quests, as the game is currently winding down from the Fontaine arc that ended with Version 4.2. Instead, the game should double down on events. Version 4.4 should host the annual Lantern Rite Festival event in Genshin Impact. The Liyue-based event happens at the beginning of every new year and tends to be filled with content.

While the nature of the story is unknown, it seems like 2024’s Lantern Rite will come with an expansion to the northern portion of Liyue region, connecting Liyue to Fontaine. This extension should be comprised of two new areas, according to the leaks. The leaks also mention a new Adepti in Genshin Impact 4.4, who resides in one of these new areas. Still celebrating the Nation of Geo, the limited-time event may also introduce three new skins for Liyue characters: one for Ganyu, one for Shenhe, and another for Xingqiu. Ganyu and Shenhe’s skins are expected to be paid, as they are for 5-star characters, while Xingqiu’s may be free.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Free Skin Offer May Be Better Than You Think   Genshin Impact players may finally be getting some generous treatment in Version 4.4 with the arrival of a surprising though limited tool.   

There should be smaller events in addition to the main flagship event focused on the Lantern Rite Festival, though there have not been leaks about them. If there are any events, they should be presented during the Version 4.4 livestream. Other than the content itself, it seems like players are bound to get a treat in the form of a quality-of-life tweak. Leaks mention that the party limit will increase, which will then allow players to prepare more team comps. If the leaks are true, then it seems like there is a lot to look out for during the special Genshin Impact 4.4 livestream.
