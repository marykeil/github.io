# TOTKs Biggest Contributions To The Zelda Series Wont Be Its Gameplay


## SUMMARY 



  TOTK&#39;s greatest aspect is its worldbuilding, introducing the Zonai and expanding the lore of the Zelda series, which will have a lasting impact on future titles.   The game&#39;s extensive world and Link&#39;s abilities make for an entertaining experience, with the potential for new tools and weapons inspired by Zonai technology in future games.   The expanding world of Zelda allows for innovative changes in art styles, game mechanics, and world designs, making it possible for the next game to be radically different from TOTK but still incorporate its worldbuilding.

## Literature Review

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has contributed a lot to the series, but its most influential aspect isn’t necessarily gameplay.




There are many ways that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has helped to shape the Zelda series, but its gameplay is arguably not what will be the most significant going forward. Zelda can learn much from TOTK and BOTW, from the developments in the two games’ presentation and the many new features they have produced. Nevertheless, TOTK’s greatest aspect (and by extension, BOTW’s) is something entirely different.




                  Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Is Going To Ruin Hundreds Of Other Games   Nintendo has filed myriad patents associated with Tears of the Kingdom in Japan, and these could harm the future of video games if they are enforced.   

Tears of the Kingdom is undeniably an incredible game, with the potential to entertain for tens, if not hundreds of hours. The version of Hyrule it presents is enormous, with the world split into three broad tiers. Moreover, Link has a wide variety of abilities perfectly suited towards exploring this open world, most notably the near-infinite possibilities of Fuse and Ultrahand. The varied, albeit sometimes niche uses of Zonai Devices contributes greatly toward this, as do the multitude of new monster parts and other items found scattered throughout Hyrule. Nevertheless, there is more to TOTK than just these features, and it is easy to consider the game&#39;s lasting legacy elsewhere.

More than any number of game mechanics, perhaps the most important way in which Tears of the Kingdom has developed the Zelda series is with its lore. For example, following vague allusions to them in Breath of the Wild, the Zonai are now far more firmly defined, with a clearer culture and place in Hyrule’s history. They even seem to have connections to the origins of the Sheikah tribe. As a result, it is now far easier to see the Zonai being included in future titles as well, something which can come about in various ways depending on the specific timeline placement.

In addition to the possibility of new Zonai characters being introduced (something especially likely in the event of a prequel to TOTK being produced), the now-established existence of Zonai technology opens the way to Link finding many new kinds of tools and weapons in future games. In a game set long after the Zonai have disappeared from Hyrule, Link could uncover new relics originating from their culture as part of a classic dungeon-crawling experience. These could be new examples of Zonai Devices, or even more mystical items closer to the Secret Stones in design or function.





 

The Yiga are another excellent example of how the world of The Legend of Zelda has expanded in the most recent games. The evil ninja clan are perfectly presented to facilitate any number of dark and evil schemes in future titles. They could operate in direct service to Ganon once again, but it is equally possible for them to work with other villains, or even take center stage themselves. The hilarious mannerisms of Kohga and his subordinates will make them brilliant additions to any new Zelda game, no matter what the gameplay itself looks like.



 New Zelda Games Will Be Different From TOTK &amp; BOTW (Probably) 
          




When considering the potential for future Zelda games, it is important to note that the series has consistently and repeatedly changed over the years. Developers have used a wide range of different art styles, game mechanics and world designs, never adhering to one particular combination for long. For example, the instantly recognizable, cartoonish appearance of The Wind Waker carried through into its direct sequels, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but did not become a mainstay of the franchise beyond that particular sub-series. Similarly, the Sheikah Technology prevalent in Breath of the Wild has been completely erased to make way for the new Zonai-related features of Tears of the Kingdom.

                  “It’s Commonplace For Strange Phenomena To Occur In Hyrule” - Zelda: TOTK Director Explains Unsolved Mystery   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s Director, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, has revealed new details of the game’s background in a recent interview.   

With this in mind, it is entirely possible that the next Zelda game will be entirely different to the open-world experience of TOTK. Considering the immense scale of the work that would be needed to improve on or even match TOTK, it is easy to see the next major Zelda game being a somewhat smaller adventure, taking the series in a new direction once more. Whether this is a 3D open world, or even perhaps a new top-down adventure RPG in the style of more classic titles, the gameplay could be radically different. However, the possibility of incorporating TOTK’s incredible worldbuilding will be present no matter what.




On the other hand, the next entry in The Legend of Zelda may well be another immense game in the style of BOTW and TOTK. In all likelihood, such a game would be a continuation of TOTK in the same way that TOTK is a direct sequel to BOTW. This would, of course, make the worldbuilding that has come before even more immediately relevant; there does not seem to be any reason for Zonai Devices to disappear in the same way that Sheikah Technology has, and so any Hyrule succeeding TOTK’s could be the most technologically advanced yet as both Zonai technology and Purah and Robbie’s own inventions gain prominence.



 The Legend Of Zelda Games Are Always Changing 
         

Worldbuilding is an incredibly important part of any long-running video game series, giving life and depth to the setting. The Legend of Zelda has built up some incredibly complex lore over time, and this is something that can easily precipitate new games. For example, Age of Calamity expands upon the backstory created for Breath of the Wild, albeit with a time travel twist. Similarly, Skyward Sword is another game that has had an immense impact on the story of games before and since, with significant developments including the origins of the Master Sword and introducing Hylia to Hyrule’s pantheon; the goddess has gone on to enjoy great significance ever since.






Despite being relatively new to the Zelda franchise, Hylia has quickly eclipsed the Golden Goddesses in terms of immediate relevance.




Gameplay features have always come and gone in The Legend of Zelda, and TOTK’s own developments in this area are sure to be treated in the same way eventually. As such, it is clear that the game’s most important contribution to the series as a whole will be its lore, from the introduction of the Zonai to the reinforcement of the Yiga as an evil (albeit comical) recurring force of enemies. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is sure to be an influential game for many years to come, purely due to the depth and quality of its worldbuilding.
