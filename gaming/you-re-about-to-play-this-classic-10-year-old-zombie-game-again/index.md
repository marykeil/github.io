## Literature Review

This decade-old Early Access title on Steam is getting a major overhaul soon, which will completely change the survival zombie horror game.




A ton of zombie titles exist, some of which are much better than others, but Project Zomboid is arguably the deepest and most realistic zombie sim created. For the uninitiated, Project Zomboid is an indie zombie sandbox game where people loot and craft items and resources to survive in a zombie-infested town. While the game itself doesn&#39;t boast the HD graphics of other zombie titles like The Last of Us or the Resident Evil franchises, it makes up for it with realistic simulation components that make the title feel like The Sims meets 28 Days Later.




The developers of the game, The Indie Stone, are gearing up for what will be the biggest update to the Early Access title to date with the upcoming Build 42, and recently shared more details behind the development of the expansive upgrade. In fact, so much is changing that it&#39;s more than likely that those who have put down the game will want to return to see what the new changes are all about, with the potential for the game to bring in a whole new audience of people.

 Project Zomboid Build 42 Is The Most Ambitious Update Ever 
         

Even though the highly complex zombie sandbox game was originally released in an Early Access state on Steam back in November of 2013, the core gameplay of Project Zomboid is still a ton of fun and has been improved significantly since the original release. Project Zomboid Build 42 is slated to be the biggest update for the game ever, introducing new crafting and professions, a host of new weapons &amp; items, more character customization options, animals, and more. 






Build 43, the next planned update after Build 42, will introduce a host of new NPCs that players can interact with as well.




The most significant difference between Build 42 and the current build is that these new features will enable people to extend the duration of their sandbox campaigns. Gathering resources from the land rather than salvaging from existing in-game items in the world will theoretically enable players to play in their world forever, as long as they can avoid a zombie bite.



 People Can Access A Test Build On The Unstable Test Branch 
          

For those who don&#39;t mind a few bugs or the potential of their save file being corrupted, there is a way to access some of the new work that the team has been doing on the game early. The Project Zomboid test branch is a special server set up by the developers that enables people to try new features before they are officially rolled out in the game. Though Build 42 is not currently on the unstable branch, it will be released there first before going live.

To access the Project Zomboid test branch, people must navigate to Betas in the Properties setting for the game. Once there, the &#34;unstable - unstable - BACKUP FIRST&#34; branch is the one that must be selected. Keep in mind that there&#39;s a good possibility for bugs or, worse yet, a corrupt saved file. As the temporary name for the branch would imply, players can avoid corrupted save files by backing up their game before trying it.



 All The Major Changes In Project Zomboid Build 42 
          

There is a ton of new content coming via Build 42. Though the developers have been conservative in what will ultimately make the cut, they&#39;ve revealed some information slowly over time on Steam. The most significant will likely be the new professions added to the game in the way of Blacksmithing, Stonework, and Brewing. Each of these will go a long way in enabling characters in the game to be self-sufficient and extend the potential duration of a save.

The Blacksmithing mechanic will enable people to mine ore from the forest sections of maps to melt down in a kiln to create new weapons. Previously, in Project Zomboid, while there are a few different weapons that could be found in the game world and modified via crafting, options were somewhat limited. Now, it&#39;ll be possible to create more advanced bladed weapons, spiked bats, swords, and spears.


 

The team is also working hard at making the game world in Project Z feel more immersive overall and will be introducing new voice lines for characters as well as animals that can be hunted. The game will also be introducing signage, more realistic doors, and a host of other changes that will make gameplay feel more streamlined.






 Project Zomboid Is Still Officially In Early Access 
          

In Project Zomboid, people spawn into the world with nothing but the clothes on their backs as they desperately seek to survive in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic wasteland. Set in a top-down 2.5D view, the game has been in Early Access for a decade at this point. Even with this being the case, if the team can execute Build 42, there&#39;s a good chance it will attract a whole new audience of people who have never played the game.

Project Zomboid is a great example of how a smaller team of indie developers with enough ingenuity and creativity can craft an experience that&#39;s truly memorable. Currently, the title is competing with AAA games as it manages to maintain a concurrent player count of around 20,000-40,000 players at any given time. Build 42 is the first step in the developers&#39; creation of the final build of the game, which aims to remove the need for servers to wipe and to provides a more realistic and robust post-apocalyptic world.




The next build, Build 43, plans to add NPCs to the game world, which should go a long way in making the universe feel more realistic, especially in single-player campaigns. The official release date for Build 42 has yet to be announced, but the most recent updates on the Steam developer blog show that a ton of progress has been made on the title, boding well for a full release of Project Zomboid Build 42 soon.
