## Literature Review

The Bachelor season 28 leading man Joey Graziadei admits he&#39;s nervous after his past heartbreak with Charity Lawson ahead of his season premiere.




The Bachelor season 28 leading man Joey Graziadei admits to being nervous about his new role after his past heartbreak with Charity Lawson during The Bachelorette season 20. Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, who currently lives in Koloa, Hawaii, was Charity&#39;s runner-up. They built a strong relationship, and fell in love with each other. However, Joey was heartbroken when Charity got engaged to Dotun Olubeko instead of him. Thankfully, things turned around for Joey when he happily accepted the role as the star of The Bachelor season 28.




In a new The Bachelor season 28 promo shared via Instagram, Joey is seen getting ready to meet the women on premiere night.


 

Joey confesses, &#34;After the heartbreak with Charity, I&#39;m nervous. This is gonna be one of the most important nights of my life.&#34; Joey then tells host Jesse Palmer, &#34;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s officially night one.&#34; He adds, &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a while, and it&#39;s different now. I&#39;ve been here. I&#39;ve done this before. And I&#39;m hoping I can be that person to give them a little bit of calmness and confidence when they come up.&#34; Joey then smiles as the first limousine pulls up with the women calling his name.

 What To Expect From The Bachelor Season 28 
          

The Bachelor season 28 already has a cliffhanger which is yet to be revealed as one of Joey&#39;s 32 contestants, Lea Cayanan, was given an envelope during Charity&#39;s &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special. She was told that she couldn&#39;t open it until premiere night. The season also features two sisters, Allison and Lauren Hollinger, vying for Joey&#39;s love. Joey&#39;s season will most likely feature the traditional Bachelor elements, including the first impression rose, hometown dates, Fantasy Suite dates, and, hopefully, an engagement.

Joey was the ideal choice for The Bachelor season 28. Although he might feel nervous on premiere night, he should also feel confident because he&#39;s there for the right reasons and will hopefully find his perfect match. He has 32 women from throughout the United States and Canada from which to make his choice. Joey is ready to fall in love and get married. He proved time and again during Charity&#39;s season that he was capable of opening up and building a strong relationship. Joey knows what he wants, and hopefully he&#39;ll find it with one of the women.




The Bachelor has been on television for over two decades, after its premiere in 2002. Joey follows in the footsteps of The Bachelor season 27 star, Zach Shallcross, who got engaged to Kaity Biggar last year during his season. They&#39;re still together today. Other successful Bachelor relationships include Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici, who&#39;ve been married for ten years, and Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell, who&#39;ve been dating since his season ended in 2021. Hopefully, Joey will be another success story on The Bachelor season 28.

The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
