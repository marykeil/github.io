<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&rsquo;s narrative is full of twists and surprises, with radical changes coming to the Arkhamverse as a result.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League features several shocking moments throughout its story. The game sees Task Force X, a rag-tag team of supervillains, sent by Amanda Waller to defeat an alien invasion led by Brainiac. Unfortunately, while Brainiac has assumed control of 99% of the city of Metropolis&rsquo; population, he has also brainwashed most of its heroes, the Justice League, resulting in Waller issuing a kill order on some of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe.
While its gameplay and tone may be different, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is the latest game set in Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkhamverse, being set only five years after the series&rsquo; last entry, Batman: Arkham Knight. Much like the other Batman: Arkham games that came before it, its story makes some bold choices involving some of the most popular DC characters, including some surprising deaths that are sure to have some major repercussions going forward.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Cast: Who Plays Which Character<br>
Suicide Squad: KTJL, has an impressive roster of DC characters, with many actors reprising their roles from previous games.</p>
<p>10 A Reincarnated Poison Ivy Is Forced To Work For A.R.G.U.S.
Waller Commands Task Force X To Put A Bomb In Her Neck</p>
<p>Pre-release marketing revealed that although Poison Ivy died absorbing Scarecrow&rsquo;s Fear Toxin and saving Gotham in Batman: Arkham Knight, she is back in child form in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and provides players with elemental-based attacks called &ldquo;inflictions.&rdquo; The game&rsquo;s story goes into more detail about how exactly this happened, stating that Ivy - who prefers to just go by &ldquo;Ivy&rdquo; and drop the &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; moniker - was found and captured early into her new life and was then raised by Lex Luthor and his team at Lexcorp.
In this time, she was also forced to work for Luthor&rsquo;s company, making weapons with inflictions for them before breaking free during Brainiac&rsquo;s invasion of Metropolis alongside her plant friend, Daphne. This new version of Ivy also has no recollection of Harley Quinn or her past life, but occasionally, over time, she begins to use scientific words and phrases that her older self would have known, commenting that she shouldn&rsquo;t know what that means yet and implying that her memories could come back someday.
Unfortunately, Ivy goes from being forced to work for one person straight into being forced to work for another, as Amanda Waller demands that Task Force X &ldquo;recruit&rdquo; her by planting a bomb in her neck. While Deadshot, King Shark, and Harley Quinn object to doing this to a child, Captain Boomerang uses the speed force to do this before their conversation has even begun, which results in the group all taking turns punching him.</p>
<p>What Happened Between Batman: Arkham Knight And Suicide Squad: KTJL?<br>
A lot has changed in the Arkhamverse in the five years between Batman: Arkham Knight and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>9 Flash Rips Lex Luthor&rsquo;s Heart Out
But A Multiversal Variant Of Luthor Helps Task Force X Later</p>
<p>Lex Luthor was revealed in his Warsuit in the game&rsquo;s promotional material, but this version of the character doesn&rsquo;t survive long. Upon trying to save Lex Luthor from a brainwashed Flash, Task Force X thought he managed to get the upper hand over the speedster with anti-Speed Force &ldquo;Decoupler&rdquo; tech. This technology stunned Flash and opened him up for attack. After unloading a barrage of bullets into a bus containing the stunned Flash, the team believed they had successfully killed their first Justice League member. This victory was short-lived, however, when Luthor noticed a patch of blood on his chest and suddenly fell to the ground. Flash then appeared alongside him, holding Luthor&rsquo;s heart and saying &ldquo;What do you know? He did have a heart!&rdquo;
Initially, this moment came as a shock, as many thought Luthor would have played a larger role in the game. Lex Luthor did assist Task Force X with their mission against Brainiac, however, but this was a multiversal variant that Task Force X calls &ldquo;Lex 2&rdquo;. Lex 2 came from another dimension that had already been conquered by Brainiac and was able to use his knowledge of the tactics he had seen firsthand to give the team an advantage.</p>
<p>Every Character Who Dies In Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League<br>
As is the case with most of the stories centered around Task Force X, Suicide Squad: KTJL sees many characters killed throughout its campaign.</p>
<p>8 Waller Destroys The Bomb Extraction Device
Punishing Task Force X For Going To LexCorp Behind Her Back</p>
<p>After finding out that LexCorp developed the bombs planted in their necks, Task Force X approached one of LexCorp&rsquo;s scientists, Dr. Sydney Happersen, in an attempt to get them removed, but Waller found out. In a fit of rage, Waller then destroyed the &ldquo;one of a kind&rdquo; machine that could extract Task Force X&rsquo;s bombs as a punishment for the breach of trust. With seemingly no escape in sight, Task Force X was forced to focus on the mission at hand instead. With the new Lex Luthor from Earth 2 assisting Task Force X, with a deep distrust of Waller, however, it&rsquo;s possible he could repair or rebuild the extraction device at some point.</p>
<p>7 Amanda Waller Plans To Utilize Brainiac&rsquo;s Mind Control
And Betray Her Agreement With Task Force X In The Process</p>
<p>Lex 2 shows Task Force X a recording of Amanda Waller and Rick Flag talking in the Hall of Justice in a bid to convince them to keep him a secret from the duo, letting them continue to believe Lex Luthor is dead. In this footage, Waller and Flag discuss how they don&rsquo;t plan to reduce Task Force X&rsquo;s sentence after the mission, wanting to use Brainiac&rsquo;s mind-controlling technology to transform them into soldiers who will mindlessly follow orders forever instead.</p>
<p>6 Batman Killed Robin In The Batcave
The Dark Knight Murdered His Sidekick</p>
<p>When Task Force X accessed a Batcave under the Metropolis Hydro Power Station, they found a hologram from a pre-brainwashed Batman addressed to the Arkhamverse&rsquo;s Robin, Tim Drake. The holographic recording shared Batman&rsquo;s countermeasures for how to defeat the Justice League - some of which Task Force X already used on Flash and Green Lantern - should any of them become compromised and also left a heartfelt message to Tim and the other heroes in the Bat Family in case anything happened to Batman himself. Unfortunately, as the hologram played, King Shark spotted Robin&rsquo;s mask on the ground in a pool of blood and suggested that the Dark Knight had killed his sidekick already, saying &ldquo;Robin was here. I do not think he won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5 Harley Quinn Developed Her Own Fear Toxin
Quinn&rsquo;s Experience With Scarecrow Gave Her The Upper Hand Against Batman</p>
<p>Batman had been using Scarecrow&rsquo;s Fear Toxin since the Knightfall ending of Batman: Arkham Knight to create a new, more monstrous Batman appearance after faking his death. After tracking the Dark Knight down in his Batcave, he uses this same toxin on Task Force X, creating a series of individual hallucinations that prey on each character&rsquo;s past regrets, insecurities, and fears. Fortunately, Harley&rsquo;s experience with Scarecrow in the past has given her the knowledge to turn this against Batman. She encourages the rest of the team to flood the Batcave with Fear Toxin, and when it seems like they&rsquo;re going to succumb to their fears, Harley reveals that she has developed her own version of the formula, which they can use to counter Batman&rsquo;s and get the upper hand.</p>
<p>Does Batman Really Die In Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League?<br>
As Suicide Squad: KTJL enters early access for those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game, the Dark Knight&rsquo;s fate has been revealed.</p>
<p>4 Superman Kills Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman Dies After A City-Spanning Battle Against The Man of Steel</p>
<p>Wonder Woman was the only member of the Justice League immune to Brainiac&rsquo;s mind control, and whereas Task Force X was tasked with killing the Justice League, she wanted to take a more non-lethal approach and cure her fallen allies. This led to a city-spanning battle between Superman and Wonder Woman which came to an end outside the Hall of Justice. Although Wonder Woman held her own against the Man of Steel, and reluctantly stabbed him in the chest with a shard of green Kryptonite, Superman used the last of his energy to kill her with his heat vision before he retreated to Brainiac.</p>
<p>3 Brainiac Has Altered The Justice League&rsquo;s DNA</p>
<p>The idea that Brainiac has also altered the DNA of those he assumes control of was also a plot device in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, as it transformed some of Metropolis&rsquo; citizens into the creatures players face across the city, and enhanced some of the Justice League&rsquo;s abilities. This was most evident in the aforementioned battle when Wonder Woman stabbed Superman with a shard of green Kryptonite - which is usually one of the hero&rsquo;s main weaknesses - and he was still able to muster enough energy to create a lethal amount of heat vision and fly back to Brainiac&rsquo;s ship.
The next time players saw Superman, he had healed completely from his wound, suggesting that the DNA alterations could provide some kind of enhanced healing ability, and they had to defeat him with a new form of gold Kryptonite. A similar event happened earlier in the game where Boomerang cut off Flash&rsquo;s finger, and the next time players saw the speedster after Brainiac took control, this appeared to have regrown. It&rsquo;s possible that as A.R.G.U.S. didn&rsquo;t claim any of the superheroes&rsquo; bodies, this may be a method in which these deceased Justice League members could return.
When Brainiac first met Task Force X face to face, he told them that he could see their potential and could &ldquo;transform&rdquo; them to make them &ldquo;superior&rdquo; if they chose to join him. Seeing as most of the team consists of extremely skilled mortals such as Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Captain Boomerang, this would likely involve undergoing a similar change to their DNA.</p>
<p>A New Batman: Arkham Game Is Possible After Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League<br>
Despite the destructive storyline in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, there are still ways for Rocksteady to make a new Batman: Arkham game.</p>
<p>2 Task Force X Kills Most Of The Justice League
Flash, Green Lantern, Batman, And Superman Are Some Of The Game&rsquo;s Main Bosses</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League delivers upon its titular promise and has Task Force X kill most of the members of the Justice League. After acquiring specific upgrades to their equipment, Task Force X is able to kill Flash, Green Lantern, Batman, and Superman in a series of boss battles before going after Brainiac himself. While the title does give away that this was going to happen in the game, many were doubtful that Rocksteady would go through with it and would find a cure or a non-lethal way around killing some of DC&rsquo;s most beloved heroes.</p>
<p>Every Boss In Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Ranked By Difficulty<br>
Suicide Squad: KTJL has Task Force X fighting some of the DC Universe&rsquo;s most iconic heroes. Some, however, are way harder to beat than others.</p>
<p>1 Brainiac&rsquo;s Plan Spans Across The Multiverse
&ldquo;Why Stop At One Earth?&rdquo;
Custom Image by Glenn Bunn</p>
<p>After successfully killing the Justice League, Brainiac teleports Task Force X aboard his giant Skull ship to meet them face-to-face for the first time. Here he tells explains his plans to terraform Earth to create a New Colu, replacing the home planet and civilization that he lost. It then becomes clear that Brainiac&rsquo;s ambition is far greater as he asks &ldquo;Why stop at one Earth?&rdquo;, suggesting that he wants to create New Colus across the entire multiverse.
This conversation is abruptly cut short, as Task Force X is suddenly teleported back to LexCorp where Lex Luthor tells them that the Brainiac they met is one of thirteen variants who are all connected via a network across various dimensions. While they&rsquo;re unable to kill the Brainiac hovering over their Earth at present, Task Force X do find a way to travel to Earth 2 and capture the Brainiac there, and when Amanda Waller kills him with a Dataspike developed by Luthor, it downloads a fragmented branch of Brainiac&rsquo;s network through Coluan technology and destroys part of Brainiac&rsquo;s Skull ship in the process. This then opens up Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&rsquo;s main narrative going forward, which will see Task Force X venture to these other 12 Elseworlds to defeat the Brainiac variants.</p>
