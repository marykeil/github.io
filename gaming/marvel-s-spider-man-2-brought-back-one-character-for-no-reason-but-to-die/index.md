## Literature Review

In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 a number of sad events occur, but some are far more crushing than others. One event in particular is a real tearjerker.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 brought back an enduringly popular figure from the previous games in the series, but it did so only to almost immediately kill him off in one of the most unbearably emotional scenes in the entire game. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 weaves a dramatic narrative with numerous characters, and though this tug at the heartstrings of long-time fans of the series is quite cheap, it is devastatingly effective. Ultimately, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 brought back one character for no reason but to die - their death is not narratively important, nor does their death present a lingering point of conflict.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.]

Introduced to players as a minor figure in the first game in the series, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, the pigeon caretaker, John Howard quickly became a fan-favorite character in Insomniac&#39;s series of video games. This lovable recurring character often appeared around New York in side missions, tasking Spider-Man with finding (and returning) his missing pigeons, or asking him to protect them from threats. Though harmless, incredibly kind, and near-universally beloved, Howard, in his only notable appearance in the game, is unceremoniously killed off-screen in one of, what is undeniably, one of the saddest and most shocking deaths in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.   


 Howard Returns In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
Howard Makes An FNSM App Request
         




Early in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man will receive an FNSM App Request directing him to Howard. Situated in the southwest corner of the Financial District, Howard can be found sitting at a dock, blissfully watching the coming and going ferries with his prized flock of pigeons. Claiming that his birds are feeling cooped up, Howard wants Spider-Man to take them on an adventure for him, requesting that Spider-Man accompany his pigeons to their new home, a park in Queens. During the deeply moving conversation, Howard directs Spider-Man to look at the passing ships, and opens up in a way he has never done before - telling him about his less-than-happy past.

Howard is a devoted caretaker of his trusty flock of pigeons, and his insistence on having them leave him is deeply out of character, even if he is doing it for their own prolonged happiness and safety. Spider-Man recognizes this and attempts to get Howard to explain what is going on, even going so far as to explain that he is there for him. Throughout their conversation, Howard&#39;s mind seems far away, he is obviously troubled by something; however, he never fully discloses what ails him. During this talk, however, Howard does deliver a great deal of dialogue that, though it certainly expands upon his previously ambiguous background, is awfully upsetting.




Howard, in an incredibly emotive and vulnerable speech, tells Spider-Man about his wife, Sandra, and explains that the birds were once hers. After she passed, he swore to take care of them, but he is going on an adventure and wants to set them free before he goes, so they can see the world outside of New York City. Although Spider-Man is reticent to part Howard from his flock, saying &#34;they need you, Howard,&#34; Howard is steadfast and Spider-Man agrees to carry out Howard&#39;s selfless wish. After a whistle, the pigeons swarm Spider-Man and he takes them to freedom.

Though he does not state it, it is overtly clear that Howard is deathly ill. His intention to free his pigeons represents his final request for his long-time friend Spider-Man. The last that&#39;s seen of Howard, he is still sitting in the same spot where Spider-Man left him; however, his time is limited. In his chat with Spider-Man, Howard makes a number of references to his past - as a factory worker, laid off after two decades of service, a redundancy that robbed him of his purpose; as a widow who lost his heart when his wife passed; and as a caretaker of bird, birds that helped him overcome his troubles.




After Howard asks Spider-Man to take his flock of pigeons to somewhere nice and up north, Howard instructs Spider-Man to whistle to summon the birds. Following this, Spider-Man must traverse through New York, following objective markers, all while a plethora of pigeons accompany him. After reaching Astoria Park in Downtown Queens, the pigeons will begin to fly around, completing Howard&#39;s wish for his prized companions to roam free in an environment where they will be happy and safe. After successfully accompanying the birds to their new home, an exhausted Spider-Man will take the train, automatically returning to where he previously met Howard - by the water&#39;s edge in the Financial District.

Howard Only Appears In One Side Mission
          

When Peter returns to the Financial District to inform Howard of the successful relocation of his birds, Spider-Man finds a heartbreaking scene. As he arrives, Spider-Man is greeted with the sight of an ambulance and two paramedics closing the back doors. Mumbling a soft, &#34;No...&#34; and then, &#34;Howard?&#34; it is clear that the returning Spider-Man is aware that the unfortunate person inside the ambulance is Howard. The paramedics state that the death &#34;Looks like natural causes,&#34; and are very empathetic with Spider-Man. They attempt to console him by stating that &#34;if it helps, it looked like he was at peace.&#34;




Spider-Man&#39;s brief interaction with the paramedics concludes with the tear-jerking and devastatingly bittersweet line, &#34;he&#39;s on a new adventure now... and his wife is with him.&#34; Though Insomniac brought Howard back in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 with the sole intention of killing him off, Howard&#39;s death is afforded a significant level of gravity and is handled in a very touching manner. Though fans of the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series will likely miss Howard in future installments, this final farewell to an enduringly popular character was a perfect send-off - a level of tribute, not many other minor characters receive in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.
