## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update included romantic hangouts where V can further interact with their romantic partners at their apartment.




Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update launched on December 5, 2023 - the same day as the release of the Ultimate Edition bundle - and included a wealth of new, highly requested features. These included the highly requested metro system seen in trailers and other promotional material prior to the game&#39;s 2020 release, enhanced gameplay mechanics, improved boss battles, and more. It also included &#34;hangouts&#34; where V could interact with their romantic partners further outside the game&#39;s main missions.




The announcement of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.1 update came as a surprise after earlier reports suggested that the massive 2.0 update that accompanied the game&#39;s Phantom Liberty expansion would be the last. This was further indicated as many developers at CD Projekt Red moved on to other titles such as the upcoming Witcher game, and Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s sequel, currently codenamed &#34;Project Orion&#34;. While 2.0 did add several features players had been requesting since the game&#39;s launch, such as car combat and better police AI, 2.1 has taken this further to finally give players the experience originally promised by the studio in its earlier promotional footage.

                  &#34;Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists&#34; - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review   Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty&#39;s unpredictable spy-thriller story is full of jaw-dropping moments, and it&#39;s got the gameplay to match.   


 V Has Four Main Potential Love Interests In Cyberpunk 2077 
But Their Relationships Were Limited Mainly To Story Missions And Messages
         




Aside from hooking up with Meredith Stout, Joytoys, or letting Johnny Silverhand have a long overdue date with Rogue, V has four main potential romantic partners in Cyberpunk 2077. For a male V, these options are Panam Palmer, a Nomad from the Aldecado family and Johnny Silverhand&#39;s former bandmate Kerry Eurodyne. For a female V, the hacker Judy Alvarez, and former NCPD detective River Ward are romancable.

When Cyberpunk 2077 originally launched, these characters could only be interacted with in their own storylines, and via the occasional messages on V&#39;s in-game phone, and after players did the last mission with their love interest, that was the last time they saw them in person until the very last mission, and even then they had to make the decision to involve their love interest in the finale to see them again. This fit with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s main campaign, as it feels like there&#39;s a ticking clock as V is constantly reminded of their failing health as a result of the Relic with Johnny Silverhand&#39;s construct degrading.




Because of this aspect to the plot, V does often seem in a rush to complete missions to find some kind of cure. Therefore, it could have felt out of place for V to spend too much time relaxing with them with this urgency looming over them, so the option to limit encounters with these partners to messages outside the missions didn&#39;t seem too out of place when initially playing through the main story. However, CD Projekt Red has worked on developing these relationships further through Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s &#34;extended relationships&#34; in the 1.5 update, and the new &#34;romantic hangouts&#34; in the 2.1 update.

                  Every Cyberpunk 2077 Romance, Ranked Worst To Best   There are a variety of romantic options in Cyberpunk 2077, but some are more rewarding than others. Which romance partner should V choose?   



 V Can Spend More Time With Their Loved Ones After The 2.1 Update 
2.1&#39;s Romantic Hangouts Are Reminiscent Of A Particular Mod
          




With the scale of Cyberpunk 2077, and players sinking hundreds of hours into the title, many did hope CD Projekt Red would add more opportunities to further build relationships with these partners outside of missions, interacting more with them face-to-face. Mods such as I Really Want To Stay At Your House - which is named after a song within the Cyberpunk universe - added this, with partners even having the option to move into V&#39;s home over time.

These mods have since become defunct on Nexus Mods following CD Projekt Red&#39;s official implementation of such a similar mechanic in 2.1, with the side quest for these hangout missions sharing the same name as the mod that came before them. Upon downloading the latest update, Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s official romantic hangouts are unlocked after completing the final mission in a particular love interest&#39;s questline, which are as follows:

 Love Interest  Final Questline Mission   Panam Palmer  Queen of the Highway   Kerry Eurodyne  Boat Drinks   Judy Alvarez  Pyramid Song   River Ward  Following the River   






The hangouts will take place in any of V&#39;s rented apartments, or their hideout in Dogtown for those with the Phantom Liberty expansion, and the primary activity is to sit and cuddle with them on the couch. During this time, V can stroke their hair, caress their cheeks, and kiss them, or they can get up and dance to the song I Really Want To Stay At Your House. There is also the option for V to shower with, and sleep next to their love interest. Upon completing this first hangout, players can message V&#39;s love interests again to invite them to hang out some more, but they will respond that they&#39;re busy and will message back after two in-game days to initiate another hangout.



The song I Really Want To Stay At Your House is also heavily featured in the anime series Cyberpunk Edgerunners.




                  Cyberpunk 2077 Characters Who Should’ve Been Romance Options   Despite early promises, Cyberpunk 2077 has a limited selection of romance options. There are plenty of characters who should&#39;ve been shown some love.   






 Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Romantic Hangouts Could Have Benefited From More Dialogue 
But It&#39;s Understandable Why This Wasn&#39;t Implemented
          

The inclusion of these romantic hangouts has been well received, with redditors such as SluppyMcPuppy calling it their &#34;favorite part of the update.&#34; However, there has been some criticism that they don&#39;t feel fleshed out enough in comparison to the rest of the game, with rhn18 commenting under SluppyMcPuppy&#39;s post saying it&#39;s a shame the hangouts &#34;reuse the same old tired conversations&#34;, stating that that more dialogue lines would have improved these moments by allowing the characters to discuss recent events.

While these criticisms are valid, the lack of such intricate dialogue options makes sense from a development perspective. CD Projekt Red would have had to bring the actors who played both the female and male versions of V, Panam, Kerry, Judy and River back in to record significantly more additional dialogue to achieve the level of conversation rhn18 desired. As the romantic hangouts feature was included as part of an update rather than a full expansion like Phantom Liberty, it&#39;s possible this just wasn&#39;t a feasible option, as developers within the company transitioned onto other projects.




Some fellow Redditors such as drxo and fractalife discussed how AI could have been used to accomplish this. However, this is definitely a controversial discussion where voice acting is concerned, with many rightly feeling that actors should be protected and compensated for the use of their voices in such a situation. There&#39;s also the lack of nuance in an AI-generated performance compared to that of a real voice actor that would have made these interactions, particularly emotional ones, feel hollow in comparison to the work done by the actors throughout the rest of the game.

                  10 Characters In Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty That Should&#39;ve Been Romance Options   Though sadly Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty DLC did not add any romance options to the game, there are many incredible NPCs that should have been.   



 Building V&#39;s Relationships Further Enhances Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Endings 
Making Them Either More Satisfying Or Gut-Wrenching
          




[Warning: This section discusses two of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s endings.]More dialogue and interaction with these love interests during their hangouts could have more of an impact on several of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s endings. Every ending has some of the characters V has interacted with appearing in the credits to voice their opinions on the actions in the finale, but the romantic hangouts could particularly add to the somewhat optimistic The Star ending, and Phantom Liberty&#39;s gut-wrenching The Tower finale.

The Star sees V leaving Night City with Panam, his new Nomad family, the Aldecados, and potentially Judy depending on players&#39; choices, and while V isn&#39;t cured, there&#39;s a hopeful note that the Aldecados will help them search for a cure, or V will at least die surrounded by those they love. The Tower, however, sees V getting cured, but they lose almost all of their relationships as their love interests have moved on in the two years they&#39;ve been in a coma following the procedure.




These finales both have such an emotional impact because of the relationships built throughout Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s story. The option to spend more time with the characters V cares most about is a step in the right direction and further enhances these endings, but it would have been interesting to see how this could have been improved and built upon had CD Project Red implemented such a feature earlier in the game&#39;s development to allow for the more nuanced dialogue options shown throughout the rest of the campaign. Hopefully, the studio will see the positive response and constructive criticism from players and will add this to the core game experience for Project Orion as a key part of building these relationships, rather than improving them through patches.
