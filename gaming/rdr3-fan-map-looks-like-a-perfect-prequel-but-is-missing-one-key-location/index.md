# RDR3 Fan Map Looks Like A Perfect Prequel, But Is Missing One Key Location


## SUMMARY 



  A fan-made map suggests a new direction for Red Dead Redemption 3, taking place in the westernmost parts of New Austin and expanding into several new states.   RDR3 will most likely be a prequel to the previous two games, set before RDR1 and 2, in order to explore new themes and areas in the Wild West.   The ideal setting for RDR3 would be the 1840s-1850s, incorporating the many historical events of that period.

## Literature Review

A fan-made map for Red Dead Redemption 3 suggests taking the series in a new direction, but thatâ€™d mean leaving a couple of iconic locations behind.




A fan-made map would make the perfect setting for a hypothetical Red Dead Redemption 3, even if it leaves out iconic locations from the two previous games. Of course, no one knows anything about Red Dead 3 at this point in time, but it is believed to be in development at Rockstar. Whatever it turns out to be, it&#39;ll have to differ significantly from the previous two games. Since RDR1 and 2 have basically taken the van der Linde-Morgan-Marston saga as far as it&#39;ll go, RDR3 will have to go elsewhere for inspiration.




Thankfully, there&#39;s basically infinite potential for another Red Dead game in the western canon. There are so many different time periods and historical events to draw on, so many different regions yet unexplored, and so many characters whose tales need to be told. RDR1 and 2 barely scratch the surface of the wide variety of stories possible in an open-world, western setting. Rumor has it RDR3 could be many things, but this one map suggests the perfect new direction for the series.

 A Fan-Made Map Takes RDR3 Further West 
But Leaves Out Blackwater And Strawberry
         

A fan-made map posted to the Red Dead Redemption Subreddit by user _RealityBoat shows a speculative setting for RDR3, taking place further to the west than the previous games and leaving cities like Blackwater and Strawberry behind. Where RDR1 and 2 take place in territory roughly corresponding to the real-life Great Plains region, Texas, and some of the northernmost Mexican states, with brief forays as far east as Louisiana and Virginia, _RealityBoat&#39;s RDR3 proposal takes place only in the westernmost parts of New Austin (Texas) and West Elizabeth (the Great Plains region), expanding northward into Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico, and westward into California.





 

In the comments, _RealityBoat goes on to explain that their RDR3 pitch would have to be framed as a prequel to the previous two games, taking place at least several decades prior. That would mean leaving out iconic characters like Dutch van der Linde, Arthur Morgan, and John Marston, at least in anything more than a cameo or passing reference.

It&#39;d also mean skipping major locations central to the plot. This concept for RDR3 would steer clear of the city of Blackwater, where the Pinkertons are headquartered and where the van der Linde gang&#39;s bank robbery goes wrong prior to the beginning of RDR2. But given the precedent RDR1 and 2 set, and the opportunities created by this fan-made map, that might not be such a bad thing.



 RDR3 Will Have To Be A Prequel 
          




One way or another, RDR3 will almost certainly be set before RDR1 and 2. In fact, RDR2 was already a prequel to RDR1, so if the third game was set even further back in time, it&#39;d only be continuing a series tradition. But both games are set at the very tail end of the Wild West era, when even formerly free territories are lobbying to be incorporated into the United States, and the government is breaking up the last remaining outlaw posses. RDR1 even includes a scene in which John Marston rides in an early automobile, signifying that his years of horseback escapades are coming to a close.

Of course, this turning of the century is framed as one of the primary themes of Red Dead Redemption and its sequel. It&#39;s what makes Dutch and John Marston such tragic characters, clinging to a lifestyle that&#39;s rapidly and violently disappearing. Those themes are well explored in RDR1 and 2, but a sequel should leave them behind to take on some new topics. Again, that&#39;d mean Dutch and the gang would be mostly, if not totally, absent, but it&#39;s probably time to move onto a new era of Red Dead.






 RDR3 Should Be Set In The 1840s - 1850s 
          

Thankfully, setting the game further west and a few more decades back in time provides the perfect backdrop for RDR3. Many world-changing historical events took place in the American West between the 1840s and 1850s that are ripe for adaptation into a future Red Dead title, perhaps most famously the California Gold Rush.

This began in 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter&#39;s Mill in California. The resulting migration saw thousands of people traveling across the country, buying up new land, prospecting, and mining for gold. Many settlements and towns popped up along the way, forever changing the landscape of the western United States. This was a fraught time, in which greed, conflict, and competition caused plenty of strife, and would be the perfect excuse for RDR3&#39;s protagonist to take a westward journey. However, _RealityBoat&#39;s map would have to expand significantly further north to realistically include the areas where gold was first found.




There&#39;s also the Mexican-American War, which began in 1845 after the US attempted to annex what is now the state of Texas, which Mexico&#39;s government held was still rightfully its territory. This was a chaotic conflict, with battles fought not only between US and Mexican troops, but also with Comanche, Apache, and Navajo raiding parties, as well as between warring political factions in the Mexican army. Since most of these clashes took place in the present-day states of southern California, Texas, and New Mexico, _RealityBoat&#39;s map would provide an excellent setting.

Mormon migration would also cause problems for the RDR3 protagonist in Utah. Beginning in the 1850s, there was a persistent idea in political circles back east that Mormons, migrating into the Salt Lake Valley, wanted to establish an independent state there. The US government, which also had designs on the Utah territory, objected, and a series of standoffs and skirmishes took place throughout the decade. While there was no significant military confrontation during the Utah Mormon War of 1857, Mormon settlers did occasionally kidnap travelers, raid caravans, and steal supplies, which could form the basis for a RDR3 side quest.




But at this point, it&#39;s impossible to know just what RDR3 will look like, and considering the development time of RDR2, it could be a while before anyone does. Until then, there&#39;s plenty of room for speculation about setting and story, and considering what the previous two games have covered, it seems like the right time to leave the east behind and tell some new stories, further back and further west. A more southwest-oriented map could be the perfect backdrop for Red Dead Redemption 3.
