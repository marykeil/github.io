## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 features some absolutely heartbreaking moments, though some are simply bittersweet, others are emotionally devastating.




Insomniac Games&#39; Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is one of the best PS5 exclusive games yet to be released. It&#39;s filled with brilliant storytelling, but this marvelous story is not necessarily a happy one; at times, some aspects of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 will leave players emotionally conflicted, and others will likely render them outright sad. These devilishly depressing events, characters, and situations are scattered throughout the duration of the game, and while some can be prepared for as they are easily anticipated, others come out of the blue and will undoubtedly take even the most emotionally prepared player by surprise.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.]
Though Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 could be regarded as having a somewhat hopeful conclusion, vast sections of the game are, while fun, dreadfully depressing. Furthermore, it is impossible to tell when and where the player&#39;s heartstrings will be pulled - though the main game missions dominate the run time, some of the saddest moments in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 come during innoxious side quests, or simply in dialogue. Ranging from brilliantly bittersweet to absolute tearjerker, some of the saddest parts in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 are absolutely heartbreaking.

 10  Miles Attempts To Avenge His Father 
Miles Fights Mister Negative
        

In the first game in Insomniacs&#39; Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series, Miles Morale&#39;s Father, NYPD police officer Jefferson Davis, is killed when the Inner Demons, a group of enforcers working for Mister Negative, attack City Hall; during Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Miles gets an opportunity to face off against the man responsible for his father&#39;s death. In one of the most emotional boss battles in the game, Miles is forced to fight Mister Negative in an arena for Kraven&#39;s entertainment. Though Mister Negative claims to be rehabilitated, he refuses to roll over and die. Miles is incandescent with rage during this battle, and Mister Negative uses this, and his father&#39;s death, against him.

 9  The Hunter Becomes The Hunted 
Venom Kills Kraven
        

Though Kraven is not a sympathetic character in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, his death is beyond shocking, and despite his criminality, uncalled-for in its brutality. After Peter rids himself of the Symbiote, Harry regains it; however, this time, the Symbiote is absolutely in control. Though Norman attempts to contain Venom, it breaks free and is met by the hunter, Kraven. This violent boss battle between two of the game&#39;s most significant antagonists ends with Kraven thoroughly defeated. Though incapacitated at the hands of Venom, this is not enough for the Symbiote, which proceeds to decapitate Kraven with a bite in one of the most unexpectedly sad scenes in the game.





 8  MJ Is Forced To Host A Symbiote 
Peter Fights Scream
        

MJ is one of the most lovable characters in the vast roster of the Spider-Man franchise; however, for a time in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, she is forced to be the host of a Symbiote, Scream. After Harry regains the Symbiote, Peter calls MJ to warn her, but it is too late and Venom is already knocking at the door. Peter rushes home to check on his beloved, but he doesn&#39;t find MJ alone. He finds her sitting at the dining table with Venom, who spawns the Symbiote Scream using MJ as a host. What follows next is one of the most unexpected, hardest, and saddest boss fights in the game.

 7  Dr. Connors Loses His Arm 
Discovering The Symbiote Changed Curt Connors&#39; Life
        

Though Dr. Connors is the architect of much of the chaos that endures during Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, he endures a terrible personal loss - that of his arm. Following the boss battle between Symbiote Peter and Dr Connors&#39; Mutate form, The Lizard, Peter saves the brilliant scientist from drowning. After Connors awakes, he is shocked to find Peter hosting the Symbiote and explains to him what it truly is. During a flashback showing the initial discovery of the Symbiote, it is revealed that the Symbiote was responsible for the loss of Dr Connors&#39; arm. The scene is devastating, with the traumatic event permanently altering Dr. Connors&#39; psychology and motivating his villainy.

 6  &#34;Find Grandpa&#34; FNSM Request 
Grandpa Earl Has Gone Missing
        

&#34;Find Grandpa&#34; is one of the FNSM Request Missions in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Though it does not possess the gravity of the main missions, this is a real tear-jerker. After finding Tasha at Prospect Park in Downtown Brooklyn, Spider-Man will be tasked with locating her grandfather, Earl, who has wandered off. Though the mission&#39;s premise is not overtly sad, the dialogue between Earl and Spider-Man upon his location is dreadfully depressing. Earl is mourning the death of his wife, sitting on the bench where he proposed to her. Furthermore, Earl is aware of his declining health, a fact that only makes this one of the saddest missions in the game.





 5  Sandman&#39;s Sorrowful Story 
Marko&#39;s Daughter
        

Scattered throughout Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, there are 14 of Flint Marko&#39;s memories - all of which concern his daughter, Keemia. Marko, better known as Sandman, is, on first appearances, a simple supervillain; however, these memories show a deeper and more vulnerable side of the game&#39;s first boss. They speak of a man tormented by his relationship with his daughter - he quite clearly sees himself as a terrible father who has sacrificed his time with her. This is heartbreaking, and though Sandman is not necessarily sympathetic, players who collect all of these memories will undoubtedly feel a degree of empathy for Keemia.





 4  Harry Osborn At The End Of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
Harry&#39;s Ambiguous Ending


 







From the game&#39;s beginning, it is made clear that Harry is suffering from a serious medical condition that could cost him his life. Though this is the catalyst of him first hosting the Symbiote, it is not until his second term as its host that he loses all control and becomes Venom. Wreaking chaos in New York, it takes the combined efforts of Peter, Miles, and MJ to finally put a stop to this, the game&#39;s most dangerous antagonist. Venom can only be killed if its host is killed as well, forcing Peter to end his best friend&#39;s life. Miles steps in and revives Harry using his bioelectric powers, but Harry falls into a coma, and in one of the saddest scenes, it is left unclear if he will survive his injuries.

 3  Peter&#39;s Time Hosting The Symbiote 
The Symbiote Suit Corrupts Peter


 







After Peter is saved by the Symbiote, it quickly becomes clear that its prolonged presence is having a negative influence on the once compassionate Spider-Man. Peter has become aggressive and discourteous, a change in personality that only becomes more noticeable as time goes on. His relationships with Harry, Miles, and MJ are strained to near breaking, he has become jealous, and his willingness to inflict extraordinary violence has vastly increased. It is not until Miles defeats Peter in a fight that he is finally freed from its pernicious embrace - though even after this, the Symbiote is not done causing havoc in New York City.





 2  A Returning Character Is Unexpectedly Killed-Off 
Howard&#39;s Death


 







Howard was introduced to players in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man and has been a recurring character in all of Insomniac&#39;s games in the series. In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, however, he was brought back to be killed off in one of the most devastatingly sad and shocking deaths in the game. As part of an FNSM Request, Howard and Spider-Man engage in some of the most deeply emotive and upsetting dialogue in the game, and following this, Howard tasks Spider-Man with freeing his prized flock of pigeons. After leading the flock to Astoria Park in Queens, Spider-Man is greeted with devastating news upon returning to Howard&#39;s location - the lovable pigeon caretaker has passed away.





 1  Kraven Kills Spider-Man 
Peter&#39;s Death
        

Being Spider-Man is a very dangerous job, a fact that Peter Parker unfortunately experiences firsthand as he is killed by Kraven the Hunter. During a battle against Kraven and his men, Kraven gets the better of Peter, stabbing and breaking off a knife blade in his side - this injury ultimately appears to take his life. Though the death of Peter is brief, as he is revived by the Symbiote bequeathed by Harry, the rapid deterioration of his ability to hold on, MJ and Harry&#39;s reactions, the scene&#39;s score, and the weather make this undoubtedly the saddest moment in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.
