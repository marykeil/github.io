## Literature Review

The Witcher 3 might be a long way out from its launch, but one big addition will change the future of the game in ways that are sure to be strange.




The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may have come out in 2015, but a new update promises to shake up the game in ways that are likely to get weird and wacky in very little time. Although The Witcher series protagonist Geralt of Rivia is certainly experienced with strange adventures, from quests involving unusual beasts to side stories that are more about the chaos of human life, there&#39;s usually a certain standard of logic in his various tales. The world of The Witcher has always taken care to ground far-flung fantasy in certain aspects of realism, something that may no longer be the case.




Although getting a major new The Witcher 3 update that&#39;s slated for 2024 is certainly a surprise, developer CD Projekt Red has consistently supported a much longer lifespan for the game than the industry standard would suggest. Most recently, a next-gen update brought new perks to playing the game on recent consoles, and a few post-launch patches ironed out any major issues and unified cross progression across systems. Even so, it&#39;s been over 7 years since the last expansion Blood and Wine released, so fans of Geralt&#39;s adventures are likely more than ready for some major new content.

 The Witcher 3 Is Getting A Mod Editor In 2024 
         




As announced in a post from the official account of CDPR&#39;s The Witcher, a mod editor is currently in the works for The Witcher 3. Per the post, it sounds like the tool will facilitate more than just map editing or cosmetic tweaks, describing the ability to &#34;create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content.&#34; It isn&#39;t yet clear what side of 2024 will see the launch of the mod editor, but the news that it exists is exciting enough, especially when it&#39;s set to release for free to anyone who owns the game.


 

Getting new content through The Witcher 3 mods might not be quite the same as CDPR delivering official expansion material, as the vast majority of it is unlikely to meet a similar bar of quality. It does, however, open the door to the kind of abandoned experimentation that can lead to fascinating applications of creativity. Playing through the official content first is still going to be the best approach for newcomers, but for anyone who knows the world of The Witcher 3 backward and forward, this could be the perfect way to shake things up in unexpected ways.




                  Best Witcher 3 Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, &amp; Triss Cosplays   The Witcher 3 universe features a plethora of memorable characters, but the game&#39;s four main faces have inspired some truly spectacular cosplays.   



 Mod Content Is Great For Games Like The Witcher 3 
          

The Witcher 3 isn&#39;t the first game to offer active support for building new things out of its resources, and many of the examples showcase just how exciting a mod editor can be. The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim might be more famous for its mods than any other game, and the Creation Kit that Bethesda provided is a huge help to anyone getting started on their own tweaks. Halo Infinite has recently generated excitement by updating its Forge tools to allow for much more interesting and robust creation options.

                  Halo Infinite Season 5 - New Maps, Modes, &amp; Forge Updates   Season 5: Reckoning offers some major new additions to Halo Infinite, both in terms of multiplayer possibilities and custom level creation.   




Some entire games have been built off of the idea of putting the tools in the players&#39; hands, like Garry&#39;s Mod&#39;s democratization of Valve&#39;s Source engine capabilities. The Super Mario Maker games focus on the basic building blocks of 2D levels, but they provide a particularly clear example of the kind of content that a community can create. Although many levels are built on cheap deaths or half-baked gimmicks, the ones that stand out often feature intricacies of design that go beyond what might be found in a standard Super Mario Bros. title.

One interesting angle for The Witcher 3 works made in the mod editor could be recreating elements from the books that never made it into the games, which take place after Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s storyline. It also provides an opportunity to step outside that world altogether and use its resources to create new settings and stories. There should also be plenty of fun in trying out off-kilter creations that don&#39;t quite come together, as much of the joy in a mod editor can be derived from embracing the chaos that it generates.




                  Witcher 3: Why Triss Is Totally Different In The Games &amp; Netflix Show   Triss Merigold’s character varies dramatically between the Witcher games and show as Netflix’s adaptation is more faithful to the book series.   



 A Mod Editor Makes The Wait For The Witcher 4 Easier 
          

Fans of The Witcher series still have a ways to go before the next installment is expected to arrive, as continued development on Cyberpunk 2077 took the lion&#39;s share of CDPR&#39;s resources for a number of years. The addition of a mod editor to The Witcher 3 is the perfect way to fill in that gap, luring players back into Geralt&#39;s boots with the promise of continually fresh material for years to come. In a market with myriad franchises competing for attention, keeping a series in the conversation brings a value to the table that can&#39;t be ignored.






The upcoming The Witcher game is currently codenamed Polaris and is planned to start a new trilogy of titles.




Deploying a functional mod editor still takes some obvious effort on CDPR&#39;s part, but it&#39;s the kind of venture that should be manageable as a side project alongside the development of major titles. It also raises the possibility that Cyberpunk 2077 or future CDPR games could see similar additions eventually, although waiting for any such announcements with bated breath might be as painful as the original Cyberpunk 2077 long haul. Even if The Witcher 3&#39;s mod editor remains a one-off bonus, it&#39;s a gift that will keep on giving.

                  &#34;Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists&#34; - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review   Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty&#39;s unpredictable spy-thriller story is full of jaw-dropping moments, and it&#39;s got the gameplay to match.   




The rocky launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and reports of crunch leading up to it caused some damage to CDPR&#39;s previously stellar reputation, but steps taken in the development of Phantom Liberty did a lot to restore faith in the company. The Witcher 3&#39;s mod editor is another example of the studio going above and beyond to strengthen its relationship with the gaming community, this time by handing over the tools for creation directly. Wild experiences await in the future of The Witcher 3, although just how innovative (and disorienting) things will get won&#39;t be clear until the mod editor releases in 2024.
