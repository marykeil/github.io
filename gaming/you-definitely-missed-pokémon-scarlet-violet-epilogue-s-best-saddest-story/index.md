## Literature Review

The story of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue chapter and the Mythical Pecharunt just became a lot more interesting with a new release.




Players probably missed out on the best and saddest story in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue chapter, even with the conclusion of the new quest. The Epilogue, officially called Mochi Mayhem, is a fairly recent addition to the Generation 9 titles, and ties in the base games’ campaign with the stories of the two DLCs, The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, in a unique mission. Mochi Mayhem gathers characters from Paldea and Blueberry Academy and takes them on an exclusive adventure in the land of Kitakami – that is, for players who have unlocked Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue.

In Mochi Mayhem, Trainers take their Paldean companions on a field trip to Kitakami to rendezvous with Kieran and his sister, Carmine. Upon arriving, however, players see that Carmine is not fine and dances manically to the idea of mochis. As they progress, Trainers discover that Carmine and other residents of Mossui Town have fallen under the toxic influence of Pecharunt in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, a new dual Poison- and Ghost-type Mythical. After defeating it and catching it, things return to normal and the Epilogue is concluded. Nevertheless, there is more content to the story told in Mochi Mayhem.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Epilogue Has A Secret Cutscene You Probably Missed   Players can miss out on a secret cutscene in the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet if they do not use a certain special Pokémon in battle.   


 Nintendo Revealed Pecharunt’s Backstory In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Epilogue 
          




Following the conclusion of the Epilogue itself, Nintendo revealed the backstory for Pecharunt. In a post made on the official Pokémon channel on YouTube, a short animated video details the tale of Pecharunt, the Mythical creature that arrived in Kitakami, and the events that led to the period that the Epilogue, Mochi Mayhem, portrays in the game itself. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet do not highlight why Pecharunt commits evil deeds with the denizens of Mossui Town nor how it got there in the first place. The video fixes that with an endearing animation that reveals a great, yet tragic tale.



The video cannot even be seen in the game and needs to be watched through the official Pokémon channels.






 Pecharunt Sought Love In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
         




As seen in the video posted by the Pokémon channel on YouTube, Pecharunt was a mysterious Pokémon living with an old couple in a faraway and unnamed land. They loved Pecharunt as if it were their own child and that affection was constantly sought after by the Mythical creature. In an attempt to please its humans, Pecharunt fashioned special mochi – the problem is that these mochi have an intoxicating effect and, basically, put anyone or anything that eats them under the influence of Pecharunt in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Being enthralled, the couple became greedy and wanted more gifts.


 

Entertained by the prospect of endless affection and love, Pecharunt sought to give more presents to the old couple. Needing help to obtain a plethora of gifts and deliver them, Pecharunt enthralled a Pokémon, Okidogi, to do its bidding. This canine-like Legendary creature helped find and deliver the gifts. At a certain point, the couple made a special request. They wanted some masks, the same ones that allow for the different Ogerpon forms in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC. This request was unusual and required an adventure, which enticed Pecharunt to accept it and set off to Kitakami.




To head out on this adventure, however, Pecharunt would need help. With Okidogi already tamed, the Mythical Pokémon took advantage of the Legendary’s brute power. On the way there, Pecharunt met up with Munkidori, an ape-like creature that had the power to predict the future and, thus, keep the Mythical Pokémon safe from harm. As such, it was also enthralled by Pecharunt. Fezandipiti was the last one tamed by the Mythical Pokémon, as its mesmerizing pheromones seemed like an asset to keep Pecharunt safe on its journey to the land of Kitakami in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.



 Pecharunt Ordered The Loyal Three To Steal The Masks In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
          

Upon reaching Kitakami, Pecharunt and its Legendary trio were instantly stunned by the Festival of Masks. That is where they first saw a human and its concealed Pokémon donning some of the masks that the older couple requested in exchange for love towards Pecharunt. The next step was to steal the masks from them, so Pecharunt had Munkidori find their lair, the Dreaded Den on Oni Mountain. Following that, Okidogi and Fezandipiti headed in to steal the four masks that are featured in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC. They were, however, caught in the act.




                  Every Legendary &amp; Mythical Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet: Teal Mask, Ranked   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s new DLC, The Teal Mask, introduces fun new powerful pocket monsters to the game, including the Teal Mask’s namesake.   

While trying to get away with the masks, Fezandipiti and Okidogi encountered the man at the entrance of the Dreaded Den. They fought and the Pokémon came out victorious, though the human was able to protect the Teal Mask that Ogerpon wears so dearly. Along with the Loyal Three, Pecharunt celebrated the acquisition, as these masks would provide it with more love from the old couple. However, this celebration was cut short, as Ogerpon, having encountered its human companion deceased, sought out revenge in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To defend itself, Pecharunt ordered the Loyal Three to fight.

Even though it faced a fearsome battle against three opponents with abilities that granted them many advantages, Ogerpon was still able to come out victorious. With the Loyal Three defeated, Pecharunt was left vulnerable to Ogerpon’s wrath. The Grass-type Legendary Pokémon approached Pecharunt and used its signature move, Ivy Cudgel, against it. According to the tale shared in the video, Pecharunt reflected on everything it had lost at that moment. After being hit by Ogerpon, the Mythical Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet was able to shield itself by entering its shell form and entered a slumber.




                  Guaranteed Shiny Catching Method In Scarlet &amp; Violet Is Surprisingly Easy   A simple new Shiny Hunting method discovered for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet makes finding the elusive Pokémon a far smoother process than before.   

This was the tale that preceded the events in the Teal Mask and Mochi Mayhem. The video reveals the reason the Loyal Three stole Ogerpon’s masks in the expansion and why Pecharunt enthralled the citizens of Mossui Town in the Epilogue. Pecharunt’s story is a tragic one and reveals that the Mythical creature did not act out of evil itself, but that its evil deeds were the result of a naive and somewhat selfish search for love. It is safe to say that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s story got a lot more interesting, even if not through the games themselves.
