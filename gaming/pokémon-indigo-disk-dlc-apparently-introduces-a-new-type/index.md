## Literature Review

It seems like the 19th Pokémon Type, which was previously teased for Scarlet and Violet in the Indigo Disk DLC, has finally been leaked.




Apparently, a new Type will be introduced in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which could be considered the 19th Type in the series. Ahead of the expansion’s release later in December, a series of information about the upcoming content has been leaked or highly rumored, which further teases those waiting to play. There are many leaks about the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, including new forms for a few beloved Legendaries like Koraidon and Miraidon.




There is even speculation about a possible connection between new NPCs and classic ones from Unova. Recently, dataminers allegedly found all the Legendaries returning with Pokémon: Indigo Disk, from fan-favorite classics like the bird trio to more recent additions from Galar, such as Kubfu and the King’s Steeds. Now, it seems like a new playable Type has leaked, and has been referred to as the 19th Type in the Pokémon franchise.

                  All Pokémon That Can Be Transferred To Scarlet &amp; Violet From HOME   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are getting over 100 creatures and forms not previously obtainable in the Generation 9 games. Here are all of them.   


 19th Pokémon Type In Indigo Disk May Be Called Stellar 
          

The account called Centro Leaks on X, which is well known for its leaks and rumors around the franchise, posted that the 19th type “is called ステラ.” They mention that this Japanese name can be translated to “Stellar”, in English. Though the official name may vary, if the leak is true, it seems this Type will have some connection to the stars. They do not mention the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, but given the proximity of the post to the upcoming content, it seems like a safe bet to connect both.






 Stellar-Type Pokémon In Indigo Disk May Simply Be A Gen 9 Mechanic 
          

There is speculation, however, that this 19th Pokémon Type will not actually be similar to regular typing dictated by regular Fire-, Grass-, and Water-types. Instead, it is expected that Stellar will be related to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Terastal Phenomenon. This has been a long-running rumor, circulating since the reveal of the Indigo Disk DLC itself. This is mainly because of how Terapagos’ Terastal Form has the 18 Tera Type icons embedded into its shell, and how the center crystal may represent a new addition.


 




Later on, in a trailer for the second part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack, shared on the official Pokémon channel on YouTube, there was a tease about a new Tera Type. The symbol is multicolored and seems to resemble the shape of Terapago’s shell. This may well be the 19th Type that was leaked and called Stellar.

For now, it is impossible to determine whether the new Type is going to be a permanent addition like Fairy-type in Gen 6 or if this will be an exclusive mechanic to Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC. If it is something akin to the former, it will be groundbreaking, as it may modify the entire chain of strengths and weaknesses and even the typing of certain creatures. If it is an exclusive mechanic, however, it is likely that it will not impact the franchise moving forward, beyond Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
