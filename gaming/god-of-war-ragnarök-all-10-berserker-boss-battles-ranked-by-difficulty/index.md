## Literature Review

The Berserkers offer some of the toughest challenges Kratos can face in God of War Ragnarök. Here are all 10 of their battles, ranked by difficulty.




Berserker fights represent some of the hardest challenges that God of War Ragnarök has to offer, but some Berserker boss battles are harder than others. The God of War series has always offered up unique threats for protagonist Kratos to overcome, and the conclusion to Kratos&#39;s Norse Saga journey is no different. Although Kratos will doubtless continue to face more gods in the future, the Berserker fights currently stand as some of his greatest achievements.
God of War Ragnarök offers many unique challenges in the game, including some tough bosses to go up against. While there are various difficult enemies throughout the Nine Realms, the Berserkers are some of the hardest the player can face off against. These ghost-like warriors put Kratos and Freya to the test as they challenge one after another. As optional fights, taking on the difficulty of Berserkers might not be appealing to everyone, particularly if one wants to stick to the main story content. The in-game rewards for Ragnarok berserker fights aren&#39;t necessarily worth it, but the sense of satisfaction and being able to regale friends with the story could well be.
            
 
 God Of War Ragnarök: How Kratos Changed His Fate 
God of War Ragnarok was expected to kill off Kratos, but the Ghost of Sparta managed to change his fate with the help of his beloved family.












 








 10  Harđrefill The Callous 
Located In Svartalfheim
        

 Harđrefill is definitely the easiest of the Berserker boss battles. If players haven&#39;t sought them out on their own yet, this will likely be the first Berserker boss they stumbled upon. His Gravestone is located in a large field of mud in western Nidavellir in Svartalfheim, close to Dvalin&#39;s. Harđrefill doesn&#39;t have anything that&#39;s difficult to read, and most of his attacks can be parried easily.
Harđrefill&#39;s main attack occurs when he jumps in the air and tries to slam down on top of Kratos. Despite the attack looking intimidating, it can be easily avoided as there is a small green pool that will appear beneath Kratos&#39;s feet that will show where Harđrefill will land. The player won&#39;t need to slow time during Ragnarok&#39;s combat to avoid this, and after dodging, they can dash in to deal damage when Harđrefill lands.





 9  Hvítserkr The Bold 
Located In Vanaheim


 







Hvítserkr is a pretty easy boss to overwhelm and defeat thanks to his smaller health bar. He doesn&#39;t have any impressive attacks outside of poison that he&#39;ll occasionally toss at the player, and his most intimidating technique is when he summons several enemies around him. These enemies are more of a boon than a bad sign as Kratos can kill them to get more health if it&#39;s needed. Otherwise, they should mostly be avoided as Hvítserkr will simply summon more minions as soon as they&#39;re all killed making the battle seem never-ending.


In God of War: Ragnarok, Hvítserkr&#39;s Gravestone can be found at Pilgrim&#39;s Landing in the western portion of the River Delta at Vanaheim. It is in a grassy shore area close to a boat dock. Defeating Hvítserkr the Bold will reward players with Pommels of the Nine Realms for the Blades of Chaos in addition to other items.

Hvitserkr the Bold in God of War Ragnarök is easy to defeat as long as players make sure they take out his undead minions before focusing on him.








 8  Haklangr The Bearded 
Located In Vanaheim
        

 Haklangr is a relatively easy boss to overcome as his movements are easy to identify, and Kratos can get the upper hand over all of them with relative ease. His Gravestone is a bit hidden and difficult to find deep inside the large Crater region of northern Vanaheim. It can be seen from a great distance, but a large gorge makes it necessary to travel a long way around to reach it.
Once battling Haklangr, there is one main attack that players need to watch out for. This Berserker will spew out a large green field of poison that can cause heavy damage. Despite its damage potential, this attack can also be used as the player&#39;s greatest asset. Moments before Haklangr summons the poison, he has a blue circle around him that leaves him open to stunning. Players should charge in as long as they&#39;re close enough and stun him quickly with their shield, then deal him tons of damage.





 7  Frækni The Zealous 
Located In Midgard


 







Frækni the Zealous is a rather straightforward boss with her movements, making her one of the easiest Berserkers to try first, but players have to remain on the offensive to ensure a victory. Dodging her red-circled attacks is critical and leaves her open to numerous free attacks that will bring Kratos closer to triumph. Her other attacks are relatively easy to parry, but getting too impatient and trying to finish the boss fight too quickly can end in brutal punishment. Occasionally, she&#39;ll surprise the player with a brutal red-circled attack that can knock a player back and leave them open to more damage.
Frækni&#39;s Berserker Gravestone in God of War: Ragnarok is in an open area on the ice of the Lake of Nine in Midgard. Counterintuitive for the placement of any gravestone, it sits on the frozen lake itself and is in front of an abandoned Realm Tower.





 6  Beigađr The Feared 
Located In Svartalfheim
        

The Gravestone for Beigađr the Feared is on a beach of Alberich&#39;s Island in Svartalfheim, close to the boat dock. This fight features one of the more frustrating attacks among the Berserkers that Kratos faces in God of War: Ragnarok as Beigađr uses electricity that will constantly shock Kratos. Failing to dodge these can make this a disappointing fight, as players will be forced to mash &#39;O&#39; until they&#39;re out of the trap. These attacks are difficult to avoid and leave the player open to brutal punishment from Beigađr. As long as players can dodge these unpleasant shocks, however, they shouldn&#39;t find this boss fight too difficult.
            
 
 God Of War Ragnarök&#39;s Easiest Berserkers To Try First 
The Berserkers in God of War Ragnarök are very challenging, but there are two who are easier than most, which makes them the best to start with.








 5  Skjóthendi The Unerring 
Located In Niflheim
        

Skjóthendi can easily be many players&#39; worst nightmares. The game has many elemental attacks, but one of the worst to deal with is Bifrost. Unfortunately, Skjóthendi tosses Bifrost around at a fast rate. These attacks can be difficult to get rid of and deal with. Players should set up a good GoW Ragnarök defense build and equip any items they have that are Bifrost resistant prior to entering the fight to avoid the headache of numerous replays. Other than this, Skjóthendi is an easy boss to overcome.
Skjóthendi is the only Berserker that cannot be challenged until after the main story for God of War: Ragnarok has been completed. 

Defeating Skjóthendi will give the player the Berserker Gauntlet a piece of the Berserker armor set that is one of the best side quest rewards in the game. Skjóthendi&#39;s Berserker Gravestone is in the eastern portion of Niflheim in the barren Mist Fields.





 4  Hjalti The Stolid 
Located In Alfheim
        

Hjalti the Stolid can be an absolute menace to deal with. However, she can also be one of the easier Berserker bosses if approached wisely. Her Gravestone is found in the southwestern portion of Alfheim&#39;s Forbidden Sands. In order to reach it, Kratos will need to free the Hafgufa that is causing the sandstorm, or else the gravestone will be obscured.
While fighting Hjalti, players should rely on their shield. Her attacks are easier to parry than other Berserkers, and she leaves herself open to several stun attacks that Kratos can take advantage of by using a shield ability to bash her. The player should dodge her red-circled attacks, parry the yellow ones, and stun Hjalti when the circle is blue. The last is the most important, as it&#39;s the best opportunity to unleash a barrage of powerful attacks. However, if Hjalti is fairly far away, it&#39;s best to just back up and save the attack for next time otherwise, her attack will deal a lot of damage.





 3  Starólfr The Troublesome And Bödvar The Fierce 
Located In Svartalfheim
        

 Starólfr certainly is troublesome, and with Bödvar at his side, things are even worse. The Gravestone for the two can be found at the Jarnsmida Pitmines Applecore entrance in Svartalfheim. Players should always focus on whichever boss is the most aggressive toward the player. They will switch back and forth but may even work together to cut Kratos down, making them a dual challenge.
As long as the player can take at least one of these annoying GoW Ragnarök gods, the other one shouldn&#39;t be as difficult. This is one of the toughest Berserker boss fights, but if one approaches it in the right way, they can handle this fight relatively easily.





 2  Svipdagr The Cold And Sisters Of Illska 
Located In Alfheim
        

The challenge that Svipdagr and the Sisters of Illska offer is brutal and unforgiving, so the best strategy here is to simply focus on one boss at a time. The Sisters of Illska thankfully share a health bar; however, they can be even more challenging than Svipdagr. The Berserker Gravestone is found along the rocky border southeast of Alfheim&#39;s Barrens and has giant pillars surrounding it. As was the case with Hjalti the Stolid, the gravestone will not be able to be accessed until the Hafgufa, causing the sandstorm is free.
In God of War: Ragnarok, players should focus on Svipdagr first, as they will constantly keep pressure on Kratos whereas the sisters will switch between Kratos and Freya. After Svipdagr is dealt with, he can focus on the sisters, switching back and forth between them. Players should also switch between the Blades of Chaos and the Leviathan Axe, depending on the sister they&#39;re fighting.
            
 
 Gná vs King Hrolf: God Of War Ragnarök’s Greatest Optional Foe 
God of War Ragnarok has two endgame bosses, Berserker King Hrolf and Valkyrie Queen Gná, but one optional enemy is stronger than the other.








 1  King Hrólf Kraki 
Located In Midgard


 







King Hrólf is one of the toughest bosses that players can come across. It&#39;s really up in the air whether he or Gná takes the cake as the hardest boss in the game. Hrólf uses a mixture of attacks that the other Berserkers use, so players should try to remember the strategies they used in all the other boss fights and put them into one strategy. His Gravestone is found in Midgard as part of God of War: Ragnarok&#39;s main narrative, but he cannot be challenged until all of the other Berserkers have been defeated.
The most difficult part of this boss fight is simply Hrólf&#39;s high defense. It&#39;s difficult to knock down his health bar quickly and deal a lot of damage. If players struggle too much, they should return to the fight later after upgrading their weapons and armor. Hrólf might be God of War: Ragnarök&#39;s greatest optional foe, so players should come fully prepared.
