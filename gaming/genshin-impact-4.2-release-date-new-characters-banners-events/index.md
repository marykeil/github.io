## Literature Review

Many details about Genshin Impact 4.2 were revealed, including its release date, new characters to obtain, story updates, events, and more.




HoYoverse has revealed more details about Genshin Impact 4.2, including the release date, new characters and planned banners, hints about the story content, and even the upcoming events and their rewards. The popular action RPG is a live-service title, which means it constantly receives updates. With them, players can experience new story quests and partake in limited-time events. During these periods, they can also try their luck and pull for limited 5-star characters. There are two new characters in Genshin Impact 4.2, but even though their additions are long-awaited, they are not the only important part of the update.




Version 4.2 is adding a very important Archon quest, which is expected to conclude the main conflict set in the region of Fontaine. The Hydro Archon, Focalors, will battle against the prophecy of the return of the Primordial Sea. The story should conclude with an epic battle, which will then be added as a weekly boss encounter that drops special materials, needed for Furina’s Ascension in Genshin Impact. There are also many events, including one that gifts a free character, as well as some quality-of-life system optimizations.

                  Genshin Impact 4.3 Character Banners - Phase 1 &amp; 2 Banners Leaked   According to new Genshin Impact leaks, the character banners for Version 4.3 are already known, and they seem promising for the holiday season.

The details about the content of the upcoming update were announced during the Genshin Impact 4.2 livestream held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch. The update is due to arrive on November 8, according to HoYoverse. The interval between the livestream and the update itself is not the regular week and a half apart because the broadcast was actually postponed. Nevertheless, the livestream’s delay did not actually affect the content itself, so players do not need to worry about having to wait more time before jumping into the contents of Version 4.2.



 Genshin Impact 4.2 - Character Banners (&amp; New Characters) 
         

During the livestream, HoYoverse confirmed the two new characters arriving in Genshin Impact 4.2: Furina and Charlotte. They had already been somewhat teased by the developer weeks ago, but are now arriving as playable characters. Charlotte was the first Fontaine hero that players met, even before the debut of the region itself. Furina, on the other hand, introduced herself as an NPC with Version 4.0. Charlotte is a 4-star Cryo catalyst character, the second of such a combination. It is expected that Charlotte will take on the role of a support and Cryo enabler in team comps, while also being capable of acting as something of a sub-DPS.






Wriothesley was the first to mix the Cryo element with the catalyst weapon type.




Furina is a 5-star hero and the embodiment of the Hydro Archon. As expected, she uses Hydro as her main element and wields a sword in battle. Furina will also be a mix between a sub-DPS and a support, as she will be able to deal a fair amount of damage while off-field, but also provide DMG bonuses to the team – Furina is also capable of providing healing, making her a jack of all trades. Furina will be featured in Phase 1 banners, along with the rerun of Baizhu. Both their banners will debut Charlotte in Genshin Impact, who will be featured with an increased drop rate.

During Phase 1, the weapons banner will also see the debut of Furina’s signature 5-star sword, Splendor of Tranquil Waters. After three weeks, the game should shift into Phase 2, which will prompt the limited-time banners to switch. At this time, the Phase 2 banners will feature Cyno and Ayato. As there are no new characters being brought into the drop pool in this second portion, this will be a period focused completely on reruns. Both Cyno and Ayato’s signature weapons in Genshin Impact, Staff of the Scarlet Sands and Haran Geppaku Futsu, respectively, will be featured in the weapons banner during Phase 2 as well.




Aside from the characters that are becoming playable, it seems like the game will also introduce a very important character in the story, even if they never become playable. During the Version 4.2 trailer showcased during the livestream, a short clip of Skirk was shown. Skirk is Childe’s mentor, who helped him when he fell into the Abyss years ago. It is unknown what role she will play in the story and if she is, in any way, connected to the Abyss Order (led by the Traveler’s lost sibling), but that will likely be shown or at least teased in Genshin Impact 4.2.



 Genshin Impact - Story Updates &amp; World Updates 
          

The exact nature of the story in Genshin Impact 4.2 is still muddled in mystery. It seems like the Hydro Archon Focalors will be trialed and sentenced by the Oratrice Mecanique d&#39;Analyse Cardinale, but will also be playing games with every major figure in the region of Fontaine. She seems to be fighting against the prophecy that states that Fontaine will be engulfed by the Primordial Sea and that only she will remain, alone in her throne. Additionally, the Primordial Sea seems to be ever-encroaching, with scenes even suggesting the demise of Navia – though that may be a simple distraction.






The Knave may also work alongside the Traveler to impede the rising waters of the Primordial Sea – despite being a Fatui Harbinger, she seems genuinely concerned about the well-being of Fontaine, her homeland.




Following Childe’s disappearance, it also seems like the Fatui Harbinger may finally be found, but perhaps inside the Abyss once again. The story should conclude with an epic encounter against a new weekly boss in Genshin Impact called the All-Devouring Narwhal. This creature is said to have emerged from the Primordial Sea and seems to have some connection to the Abyss. Once players battle it in the story, they will unlock the All-Devouring Narwhal weekly boss fight. The story itself is not the only main addition, as the game will also receive a plethora of new areas, including the island of Errinyes, where the Opera Epiclese is located.

There, players will be able to explore the Lakelight, unlock the Errinyes Forest through a new World Quest, visit the Foggy Forest, and encounter the Weeping Willow of the Lake. There will also be an extension to underwater areas surrounding these locations, many of which contain secrets. In fact, there will be a new world boss in Genshin Impact 4.2 called the Hydro Tulpa. This opponent will be hidden within an underwater cave, so players will need to swim and explore to find the new enemy. Inside the new aquatic regions, there will also be a new Fontemer Aberrant, which will grant a new underwater ability that fires Hydro projectiles.






 Genshin Impact 4.2 - Events, Rewards, &amp; System Updates 
          

The flagship event in Genshin Impact 4.2 will be Thelxie’s Fantastic Adventures. The most important aspect of this event is that players will be able to obtain Freminet for free by participating. There are three stages in the event, which revolve around repairing Freminet’s clockwork penguin, Thelxie. Players will help reconstruct its circuits, search for helpful components underwater, and then have the clockwork penguin assist them in a special battle mode. Version 4.2 will also see the return of tactical fungi battles with Lil’ Fungi’s Fun-Tastic Fiesta – the team revealed this is meant to become a permanent mode in the future but is currently going through trials.

The upcoming update will also feature an event called Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log, which will see Traveler helping Pauline by taking photo samples, which can be exchanged with friends. At the end of the event, they will receive the Special Analysis Zoom Lens. This gadget will allow their Kameras to zoom in. There will also be a battle mode event in Genshin Impact 4.2 called Misty Dungeon: Realm of Water, featuring trial characters and Ley Line Disorders that offer gameplay modifiers. The version will be wrapped up with a Ley Line Overflow, which allows players to grab a limited amount of double rewards in Ley Lines.




In addition to the content itself, there will also be some quality-of-life system optimizations. The most notable one is that HoYoverse will introduce a quick-start mechanism for weekly bosses. Players that are at Adventure Rank (AR) 40 or above will be able to unlock weekly boss fights, even if they haven’t faced the opponent in the story quests. Those who leveled up enough but are still wrapped up in Liyue’s Archon Quests, for instance, will be able to challenge the All-Devouring Narwhal or Guardian of Apep’s Oasis in Genshin Impact. This will allow them to level up the Talents of new characters, without getting blocked by story progression.

Some other system optimizations include new features in Genius Invokation TCG like codes to share decks and upgrades to the amount of decks players can save. There will also be a Stellar Reunion Update, which will provide several login rewards and exploration guides for returning players. The game is also optimizing quests, offering clearer details about prerequisite quests that block progression and more. It seems like there is much to look out for in Genshin Impact 4.2, from major plot twists to finer adjustments.
