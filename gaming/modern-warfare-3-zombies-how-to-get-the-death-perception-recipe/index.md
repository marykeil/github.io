## Literature Review

A Perk-A-Cola recipe called Death Perception can be hard to get in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies unless you obtain some rare blueprints found randomly.





Drinking a can of Death Perception allows you to spot chests, item drops, and enemies easily, even through solid walls across Urzikstan. This effect is subtle compared to other power-ups from a Perk-A-Cola in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. Usually, you can find machines that disperse various cola flavors, but these can be hard to discover since they spawn randomly on your map.






Another way to get a can of Death Perception is to receive the power-up through Rift Rewards, which appear when you or your squad complete a mission during a deployment.

 How To Find the Death Perception Recipe in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

The best way to get the recipe for Death Perception Perk-A-Cola in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is to complete the &#34;Two-Factor Authentication&#34; Tier 1 mission in Act 3. You could find the blueprints for this beverage flavor in a random drop, but this requires extraordinary luck. By comparison, this quest is fairly simple, only demanding that you finish a Defend Ground Station Contract.




The Contract here must be completed with the computer having 60% or more health left to reward you or your squad with the Death Perception recipe. These missions only start when you begin to upload information into a Ground Station in Urzikstan. One of the easiest ways to tackle this quest is to place down Sentry Guns in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies to help defend the Station.



When you gain the Death Perception recipe from this Contract, remember that you can only make one of these Perk-A-Cola flavors in your crafting menu every three hours.




When you meet the objective for the Contract, you will receive the blueprints that become part of your crafting menu whenever you or your squad exfil from the map. From the Gear Menu, you can craft a can of this cola flavor by selecting it from your known Schematics. You do not need to get any other materials other than the Death Perception recipe to make this item in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.
