## Literature Review

Previews have arrived for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s The Indigo Disk DLC, answering some questions about what the experience has to offer.




The Indigo Disk is set to wrap up Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC, and it&#39;s finally become possible to get a clearer look at what the new experience has to offer. Various previews of the game have offered a number of creators and outlets a gameplay sample from The Indigo Disk ahead of its December 14 release. Although sifting through for the most interesting reveals can be a challenge, it offers an exciting sneak peek at the future of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
The Indigo Disk DLC follows up on The Teal Mask from September this year, which took trainers far from the main games&#39; setting of Paldea to the new area Kitakami. The Indigo Disk moves on to Blueberry Academy, an underwater campus that acts as a sister school to the Naranja and Uva academies from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Many of the core features will match what was presented in the preceding content, but The Indigo Disk is also set to have some interesting shake-ups.

 5  The Indigo Disk&#39;s Terarium Is Full Of Double Trainer Battles 
Single Trainer Battles Are Sidelined For Once


 







The Indigo Disk DLC preview allowed access to the Terarium, an undersea park that replicates a number of separate biomes with a wide variety of Pokémon contained within. There are also plenty of fights with other high-level trainers to be found here, as Blueberry Academy focuses on teaching prowess in Pokémon battles. Interestingly, the preview write-up on Serebii mentions that these were consistently Double Battles, unlike the standard focus on Single Battles that the series is more heavily identified with.
Leaning into Double Battles helps provide a challenge for trainers who have already done plenty of grinding in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and The Teal Mask, opening up avenues for more complicated strategies than the type that Single Battles typically employ. It also helps make The Indigo Disk feel substantially different from other Pokémon experiences, and the DLC format could be the perfect way to play around with more targeted gameplay ideas like this. Double Battles also ramp up the pace and more accurately reflect the common focus of Pokémon competitions.





 4  The Indigo Disk&#39;s Performance Is More Of The Same 
Scarlet And Violet&#39;s Performance Problems Persist
        

One sore spot in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is optimization, with generally unimpressive graphics feeling even more frustrating when accompanied by potential issues or slowdown. This has been more or less the going rate for Pokémon games on the Nintendo Switch, with expanded graphical scope incurring its share of troubles. Previews make it sound like The Indigo Disk DLC rests comfortably within the same zone, with no huge positive or negative surprises when it comes to performance.
Serebii describes the overall performance in The Indigo Disk preview as &#34;ok&#34;, qualifying that it still encountered basic issues. It apparently hasn&#39;t taken a turn for the worse from the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, however, and nothing seemed as bad as Casseroya Lake did at its worst in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Digital Trends took the harsher task of saying the graphics are still &#34;a shocking mess,&#34; pointing out apparent limitations of draw distance and loading environmental details.

 3  New Pokémon Moves In The Indigo Disk DLC 
Several New TMs Can Be Learned


 







It&#39;s no surprise that The Indigo Disk is introducing some new moves, and previews for The Indigo Disk have shed a little new light on what can be expected. Some had already been revealed on the official Pokémon website, with Upper Hand offering a new Fighting-type physical option that gets ahead of priority moves and Psychic Noise shutting down HP recovery while dealing damage as a Psychic-type special move. The Indigo Disk Pokémon Iron Crown and Raging Bolt have also had unique moves revealed in the form of Tachyon Cutter and Thunderclap.
Two new moves revealed through the preview are Supercharged Cell and Hard Press. The Serebii article describes the latter as &#34;a Steel move which does more damage the higher the target&#39;s Hit Points,&#34; meaning it could potentially be a heavy hitter against particularly tanky Pokémon. There are also plenty of returning TMs to make use of, so The Indigo Disk DLC shouldn&#39;t have any shortage of opportunities to hone Pokémon movesets for battle.

 2  Flying Is Easy In The Indigo Disk DLC 
Gliding Has Finally Been Outmoded
        

The Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Legendary Pokémon Koraidon and Miraidon had the ability to fly in the base game, but its execution was disappointing in practice. Like Pokemon Legends: Arceus, the game&#39;s implementation of flight was essentially just gliding, which didn&#39;t offer as much mobility or excitement as it could have. The Indigo Disk is set to introduce proper flight mechanics, an exciting precedent for the future of the series.
Challenges that focus on flying through rings can go very wrong in games, with Superman: The New Superman Adventures for the Nintendo 64 still looming large as an example of just how frustrating things can be. In The Indigo Disk DLC, however, it sounds like one such challenge is a breeze. Although a bit more difficulty could be exciting, this does confirm that flight controls must be fairly intuitive and effective, so taking advantage of them should be fun when the opportunity arrives.

 1  The Indigo Disk&#39;s Elite Four Is Challenging 
The Indigo Disk Difficulty Is Much Harder Than The Teal Mask
        

Previews of The Indigo Disk DLC featured a battle against one of the Blueberry Elite Four, which apparently posed a surprising level of challenge. Although Elite Four fights are always supposed to be true tests, having a well-prepared team usually makes them predictably manageable. In The Indigo Disk, however, a Level 80 Pokémon team would apparently qualify as underprepared, and bumping things up to Level 88 doesn&#39;t tip the scales to easy.
Serebii describes the fight as more akin to the hardest parts of a Battle Tower facility than standard Pokémon main story fare. It sounds like The Indigo Disk is taking its role as the final challenge of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet seriously, and even Level 100 Pokémon could still meet reasonable resistance. This makes for a marked change from The Teal Mask, which erred on the easier side of things, setting up an exciting future for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
