## Literature Review

The Heavy is the most devastating class in The Finals. But, it is slow and easy to hit. This means you want to secure areas to be ready for the enemy.





Due to the lack of mobility, Heavy characters rely more on team composition. You will want to create opportunities for Light builds in The Finals to ambush and flank. You will also want to stick close to Medium-class players who offer support and protection.

The core of all classes is the Specialization. This determines the main ability a character can use throughout the match. Weapons and Gadgets are secondary and will factor in how close or far you fight. You are the most effective at mid-range but can still be threatening in close encounters.



You are allowed to Reserve items in The Finals. Weapons and Gadgets can be swapped in when respawning after a death. You can also change gear between matches, which is practical in a tournament or competitive setting.







 Ability Name  Ability Type  Function   Lewis Gun  Main Weapon  Mid-range light machine gun with high recoil and has 47 rounds.   SA 1216  Main Weapon  A close-range shotgun that deals great damage per hit and has16 rounds.   Sledge Hammer  Main Weapon  Slow swing melee weapon. Can damage walls, making it more ideal for supporting allies.   Mesh Shield  Specialization  Creates a barrier in front of the Heavy. Very similar to Reinhardt’s shield in Overwatch 2.   Goo Gun  Specialization  Fires goo in a controlled trajectory. This blocks areas and can also be used as a platform.   RPG-7  Gadget  Fires a deadly rocket from long range. It can also destroy walls on direct impact.   Dome Shield  Gadget  Creates a stationary shield that protects all allies that stay inside.   C4  Gadget  Stick an explosive onto a surface that can be detonated via remote.   





The more beginner-friendly builds in The Finals utilize Mesh Shield and the SA 1216 first. As you become more familiar with The Finals mechanics, consider switching to the Goo Gun and Lewis Gun. However, always be flexible and change your build based on your team and the enemy’s composition.




With two shield types, the Heavy role can easily blockade maps in The Finals. Use this to secure the Cashout Station or Vault for aggressive foes. Just remember that your job is to defend space. If the enemy retreats, let the Light players hunt them down while you stay behind to refortify.
