## Literature Review

In Hogwarts Legacy, which house a player gets sorted into matters for more than just cosmetics, there are also unique quests available for each. 




Hogwarts Legacy offers unique quests that are specific to whichever Hogwarts house they become a part of. These quests could be a major draw when deciding which house to join, although they will all eventually lead back to the same point in the main story. The Hogwarts house quests each have a vastly different style and feel, and each one leads into various areas of interest in the castle and surrounding areas. Knowing about these house quests may factor into which house - Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, or Slytherin - that the player chooses.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Hogwarts Legacy.]
Deciding which Hogwarts Legacy house is the best choice can depend on many factors, including the personality type someone wants their character to have or which common room they prefer. One of the biggest things to consider is the unique quest that each Hogwarts house gets to experience. The quests vary greatly in their storytelling, and even in how they are played. Ultimately, they will all bring players back to the same story point and will each introduce characters to the ghost of Richard Jackdaw, a student at Hogwarts more than a century before the protagonist comes along. Each house&#39;s quest looks at different aspects of his time at Hogwarts before he died and became a ghost.









 








 4  Ravenclaw&#39;s Exclusive House Quest Is All About A Stolen Wand 
Hogwarts Legacy Quest: Ollivander&#39;s Heirloom
        

Students in Ravenclaw get to assist the wand maker, Ollivander, in their house-specific quest. Gerbold Ollivander needs help in the matter of finding a special heirloom wand stolen long ago by Richard Jackdaw. This questline, perfect for anyone who enjoys searching for the best wands in Hogwarts Legacy, leads to the Owlery. This is where the ghost of Richard Jackdaw is eventually introduced to Ravenclaw students. Jackdaw promises to assist in locating the wand for Ollivander but also with the missing pages from a torn book.
All house-exclusive quests in Hogwarts Legacy end with finding the missing pages in order to advance the main story. 

Although Ravenclaw&#39;s house quest doesn&#39;t provide the most interesting path to meeting Jackdaw, it&#39;s still an enjoyable hunt. The Owlery is also home to several Field Guide Pages, so students in this quest will naturally be able to gather those along the way. The quest also plays into the idea of Ravenclaw students&#39; personalities, showing a quest for knowledge and discovery.





 3  Gryffindor&#39;s House-Exclusive Quest Involves The Headless Hunt 
Hogwarts Legacy Quest: The Hunt For The Missing Pages


 







Gryffindor house members get to participate in the quest &#34;The Hunt For The Missing Pages,&#34; which takes them on an eerily entertaining adventure involving Nearly Headless Nick. The quest progresses through a series of events where the protagonist helps Nick obtain some rotten roast beef in a fruitless attempt to convince the Headless Hunt members to let him join. In doing this, the protagonist gets to see Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s kitchens as well as play a game with the Headless Hunt in the pumpkin fields near Hogsmeade Cemetery. The quest ends with the player meeting the headless ghost of Richard Jackdaw.
While this may not be the most fascinating of the four house quests, it is exciting to see so many Harry Potter locations and characters recreated in Hogwarts Legacy. Fans of the Harry Potter films, and particularly readers of the books, can enjoy their time spent with the classic character Nearly Headless Nick and appreciate just how long he&#39;s been attempting to join the Headless Hunt. Even newcomers to the world of Hogwarts can find plenty to love about the Gryffinder house quest in Hogwarts Legacy. Interacting with this iconic ghost, visiting the kitchens, and even playing the game with the Headless Hunt all add up to a thoroughly enjoyable experience.





 2  Slytherin&#39;s House-Exclusive Quest Involves A Famous Wizard Family 
Hogwarts Legacy Quest: Scrope&#39;s Last Hope
        

Slytherin students start out their quest after going on a bit of a scavenger hunt for notes left by the headmaster&#39;s house elf named Scrope. Eventually, Scrope himself appears and explains that he needs a ring retrieved from Appolonia Black&#39;s grotto. It is there that the protagonist gets to meet Richard Jackdaw, who admits he sold the ring but has some important missing pages with his corpse.
Poor Scrope was not able to get the ring, but for anyone who like seeking out clues and following threads, the quest makes for a fun series of scavenger hunts anyway. It&#39;s also interesting for lore, since it involves the Black family and ancestors of fan-favorite Sirius Black. Still, the ending feels a bit anticlimactic, since Jacksaw already sold the ring.





 1  Hufflepuff&#39;s House-Exclusive Quest Goes To Azkaban 
Hogwarts Legacy Quest: Prisoner Of Love
        

Members of Hufflepuff have the best house-specific quest in Hogwarts Legacy with the &#34;Prisoner of Love&#34; questline. A portrait of a past Minister of Magic requests the player&#39;s assistance in solving a decades-old murder mystery. Student Richard Jackdaw went missing and was later found as a ghost, and a young woman, Anne, was charged with his murder without any proof.
This journey provides the most interesting and unique benefit of any Hogwarts Legacy house-specific quest by taking players to the exclusive location of Azkaban Prison. There, they meet with Anne before heading to complete the puzzles Richard had originally made for Anne when he was trying to woo her. It&#39;s an oddly dark storyline with nice story beat moments, and going to Azkaban is the highlight.
Each of these exclusive Hogwarts Legacy house quests brings to light a different piece of the story of Richard Jackdaw. The mystery surrounding Jackdaw continues in later quests and these introductions to him are clever ways to not only bring him into the story but encourage players to replay the game through different houses. Doing each quest with a new character is also necessary for trophy hunters who want to 100% the game, since trophies and achievements are tied to each house quest. Hogwarts Legacy has a few other areas where dialogues and small details may vary between the different houses, but for the most part, the above quests are the only ones that are truly unique from each other.
