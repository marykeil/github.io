## Literature Review

One of the rarest achievements you can unlock in The Talos Principle 2 called &#34;Chicken&#34; comes from refusing to participate in the game&#39;s story.





Before getting the &#34;Chicken&#34; trophy/achievement, you must beat the Training tutorial that teaches you basic systems and mechanics. This segment introduces you to some of the characters in The Talos Principle 2 and the general setting you&#39;ll be interacting with. Continue past the Training until you are offered a chance to go along on an Expedition that goes into the game&#39;s main city.




                  The Talos Principle II Interview: New Mechanics, More Characters, &amp; Harder Puzzles   Developers behind The Talos Principle II discuss the new puzzling mechanics, characters, and philosophical concepts introduced in the sequel.   


 How To Get The &#34;Chicken&#34; Achievement in The Talos Principle 2 
          

To unlock the &#34;Chicken&#34; achievement in The Talos Principle 2, just refuse to go on the Expedition when asked after completing the Training introduction. As your character is surrounded by other robots near a briefing table, they will ask you if you want to join in their journey. Pick the dialogue prompt that says &#34;Sorry, not interested&#34; to immediately play the full credits of the game, ending your adventure early.

The ending that appears through this option is abrupt, rewarding you with the achievement and a short cutscene after scrolling through the credits fast. There are 59 other achievements found in the main story, so it might be wise to restart The Talos Principle 2 and choose to join the Expedition this time to get the rest. Many other goals are tied to the choices you make throughout the game&#39;s events.




For those playing The Talos Principle 2 on PlayStation, the &#34;Chicken&#34; trophy is considered a Bronze reward on the path to a full Platinum for reaching every goal in the game. For anyone on Xbox, you will be given 5 Gamerscore, a small but fair amount for making a rare choice. Steam players will only get a notification that counts toward the 100% completion of the puzzle title within their Library.

If you happen to miss getting &#34;Chicken,&#34; feel free to start a new game and reach the area past the tutorial to quickly unlock the achievement in The Talos Principle 2.
