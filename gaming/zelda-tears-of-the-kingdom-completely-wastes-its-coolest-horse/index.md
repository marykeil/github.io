# Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom Completely Wastes Its Coolest Horse


## SUMMARY 



  There are a number of unique horses to be found in Tears of the Kingdom, but one is sadly underused.   Ganondorf has a special steed only glimpsed briefly during a cutscene.   This horse has an incredible design and is never used anywhere else in the game, and could&#39;ve been part of a fun boss fight or part of a quest.

## Literature Review

Disappointingly, the coolest horse that can be seen in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also thoroughly wasted by the game.




The most impressive horse design that can be seen in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom completely goes to waste in the game. Much like in BOTW, TOTK features herds of tamable horses with a variety of coat patterns as well as several more unique specimens. However, by far the coolest design of all also goes sadly underused.




The unique horses found in TOTK are an interesting addition to any stable collection, and can be found in various ways. In addition to several being transferable from BOTW, ensuring a charming point of continuity between the two titles, Link can also follow rumors and the occasional side quest to find horses that stand out from the crowd. For example, Princess Zelda’s striking new golden horse is found perilously near a Gleeok in the Tabantha Snowfield, while the enormous Giant White Stallion can be found roaming wild near Horse God Lake. However, another unique horse is glimpsed only briefly in the game, and it is woefully forgettable as a result.

                  The Next Zelda Game Needs To Bring Back The Series’ Best Tradition   A classic Legend of Zelda tradition has been absent in recent games, and as a result it would be perfect for it to be revived in the next title.   


 Demon King Ganondorf’s Incredible Horse Is Only Briefly Seen In TOTK 
          




In TOTK’s 11th Memory, The Demon King’s Army, the newly-empowered Ganondorf can be seen riding an incredible demonic horse as he leads an army of monsters in attacking Hyrule. The horned steed matches its rider with parts of its body glowing red, and even seems to have natural armor. It is a truly perfect horse for the Demon King to own. And after this brief Memory scene, one of the shortest in the game, it is never seen again.



Link’s own iconic horse, Epona, is available only in TOTK via transfer from BOTW or by using the Super Smash Bros. Link and Twilight Princess Link Amiibos.




There are many ways that this horse could have been incorporated into TOTK, and its uniquely intimidating appearance would have easily made any sequence involving it a memorable part of the game. For example, Ganondorf’s horse could have provided a unique boss fight, either alone or accompanied by Phantom Ganon. Although Bokoblins can ride horses, there are no higher-level enemies in TOTK that follow a cavalry theme. As such, facing Phantom Ganon riding his own steed would have presented Link with a unique challenge. This would be particularly true if the encounter took place in the Depths, where Link would perhaps need to capture a Stalhorse for an even fight.




A horseback battle through the Gloom-filled Depths would have been an incredible battle to experience, both mechanically and visually. But as it stands, TOTK simply wastes the potential setup of briefly seeing this horse in action in the Memory cutscene. It is a disappointing outcome, particularly as there will be no DLC additions which could likewise incorporate this horse into a future update. Of course, it is not impossible that this design will be reused for a future Zelda title, but given that the series may take a new direction or make a clean break after TOTK it may just as easily never see further use.



 TOTK Should Have Had An Encounter With Ganondorf’s Horse 
          

The ability to encounter this demon horse during the course of regular gameplay would also have opened up the possibility of Link taming it, most likely as the reward for a preceding boss fight. Naturally, it is easy to see this horse having incredible base stats from the outset, with maximized strength being particularly appropriate thematically. In any case, it would be extremely impressive to own, and Link riding it into battle against its former master’s minions is a very entertaining prospect in itself. The demon horse could even have had a unique ability, perhaps one related to Gloom, making it an even more valuable addition to Link’s stable roster.




Of course, it should be noted that there is an in-game option for those looking for a powerful horse. The Giant Horse first found in BOTW is clearly a descendant of another of Ganondorf’s mounts, albeit a much more mundane one aside from its sheer size. As with all other horses, it can be transferred to TOTK from its predecessor, or else found as the Giant Black Stallion wandering in the area of Hateno Bay. Its black coat and red mane give it a notable similarity to Ganondorf’s steed in Ocarina of Time, as well as his newly-revealed demonic steed, implying it is a distant relative of one or both.



 Ganondorf’s Demonic Steed Would Have Been An Impressive Addition To TOTK 
         

Introducing the newest version of Ganondorf’s Steed as a tameable entity would have been easy to do, with there being multiple equally viable methods for doing so. As with other unique horses in TOTK, it would be easy to hint at its existence through rumors heard from NPCs, particularly if it was made to be encountered on the surface. Alternatively, it could have been the subject of a side quest designed to point Link in its direction, or even simply exist as a complete surprise for people to come across. In any case, it is hard to see its inclusion being anything other than successful.




                  Zelda: There&#39;s A Reason Epona Is A Horse In Ocarina Of Time   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time introduced Epona the horse to the series, which was created to fill a very specific role in the game.   

TOTK’s rendition of Ganondorf’s own horse is an incredible addition to the franchise. In light of that, it is very disappointing that it does not appear in the game beyond one brief cutscene when there was clearly the potential for so much more. This demonic steed could have been part of an incredible fight and even tameable, but in the end seems to have permanently perished long ago during the Imprisoning War. Of course, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is not lacking in content, including plenty of other unique horses to find, but this omission is all the more apparent and notable for that one tantalizing glimpse.

               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017. A rare occurrence in Zelda titles, Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel instead of loosely connected. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link will take to the skies and learn about a mysterious kingdom in the clouds. Additionally, he will discover the secrets of the dark ones that dwell below and above the earth. The sequel is being built on the same engine as the original, with unique physics tools again being utilized. However, little about the plot and gameplay is known.     Franchise:   The Legend of Zelda    Platform(s):   Nintendo Switch    Released:   2023-05-12    Developer(s):   Nintendo EPD    Publisher(s):   Nintendo    Genre(s):   Action-Adventure    ESRB:   E10&#43;    Prequel:   The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild    How Long To Beat:   35-50 hours
