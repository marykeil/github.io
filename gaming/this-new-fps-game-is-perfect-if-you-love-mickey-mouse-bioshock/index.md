## Literature Review

While the BioShock series is currently dormant, an upcoming indie FPS might be able to provide a similar experience with some original ideas.




While the BioShock series hasn&#39;t had a standalone new entry since the release of BioShock Infinite in 2013, an upcoming indie FPS might be able to fill the franchise&#39;s shoes while bringing its own unique ideas and art style to the table. Mouse, from independent studio Fumi Games, has a retro theme that BioShock fans may find familiar, with an aesthetic that fully leans into the same 1930&#39;s rubber hose cartoon animation style that inspired Cuphead - unlike Cuphead, though, Mouse aims to put the unique art style to use in a fully-realized first-person shooter.




Despite being an immensely popular FPS franchise, and a spiritual successor to the classic System Shock games, the BioShock series has seemingly been in a kind of stasis since the release of Infinite and its DLC, Burial at Sea, with no new releases or announcements aside from a BioShock movie in the works at Netflix. In terms of new additions, the prospective next BioShock game was revealed to be in development in 2019, although no further official news on a BioShock 4 has been revealed so far. With the next BioShock seemingly still far from any potential release, fans of the series may want to start looking towards other promising upcoming releases, like the upcoming Mouse.

                  BioShock Creator&#39;s Next Game Is Already Better Than BioShock 4   Fans have been waiting years for a BioShock follow-up, but a newly revealed title might actually fit the bill better than an actual sequel.

Although Mouse is still a long way off from release, and not much has been revealed about its story or setting, the core gameplay and level design seem firmly established. The most recent trailer for the game (via IGN) displayed fully modeled 3D environments and a variety of weapons and powerups, including normal guns like shotguns and revolvers, alongside more cartoonish options such as sticks of dynamite and literal finger guns. 


 

Alongside the combat, some short parts of the trailer show the player being able to collect money, in-game collectibles, and a small story snippet in the form of an old-timey newspaper.



 Mouse Combines BioShock Gameplay With A Cartoon Aesthetic

Set for a 2025 release on all major platforms, Mouse&#39;s FPS gameplay shares some distinct parallels with BioShock, seemingly taking on a similar level structure and giving players multiple options for combat. However, while Mouse might share some of its retro aesthetic and gameplay mechanics with BioShock, it seems far from being a clone of or successor to the series, with a radically different art style and presentation that takes itself much less seriously, fully leaning into cartoonish violence and humor.

While Mouse is likely to face some changes before its eventual release, the game&#39;s brief gameplay trailer already shows it in a promising light, combining a unique aesthetic with chaotic-looking FPS gameplay and interesting environments. Though there are definite resemblances to BioShock - and fans of that franchise may find something to like in Mouse - the game also seems like a wholly unique product put forward by an independent team.
