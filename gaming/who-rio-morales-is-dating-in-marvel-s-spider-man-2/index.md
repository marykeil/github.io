## Literature Review

Though mentioned throughout, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, the identity of Rio&#39;s beau is withheld from Miles until the post-credits. But who is he really?





[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.]




Though only a minor character in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Rio plays a sizable role as her son&#39;s most constant supporter. Throughout Insomniac&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series of games, Rio is shown to be a deeply sympathetic character with an extraordinary level of empathy for her local community of Harlem - even after the violent death of her husband, Rio still made an effort to make others in her community feel safe. While Miles&#39; father, Jefferson Davis, was a beloved character, fans will likely celebrate the fact that Miles&#39; mother has found herself a new man — even if players have to wait a frustratingly long time to find out just who he is.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.   


 Miles&#39; Mother Reveals A Secret 
Rio Has Been Going On Dates And Has Met Someone
          




In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, Miles&#39; father, Jefferson Davis, a distinguished NYPD Police officer, is killed during an Inner Demon attack at City Hall. Miles and Rio are both overwhelmingly devastated by the loss of Jefferson, a theme that plays a large part in their relationship throughout Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Though a picture of Jefferson still resides on the Morales family fridge, by the start of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Rio has taken the likely difficult decision to try and move on from the tragedy by going on some dates, and one man, in particular, seems to have captivated the widowed mother; however, his identity is kept rather secret throughout the game.

While Miles is composing his college essay, he receives a call from Peter requesting assistance. Though Miles is all too happy to take a break from his task, he runs into Rio while on his way out, and she needs to talk about a big change in her life. As far as Miles knows, he and his mother have both been working late recently; however, during the awkward conversation Rio reveals that she has, in fact, been exploring the dating scene, and she has met a guy that she is ready for Miles to meet. She wants her mystery man to come to the house and meet Miles over Pastelón.






 The Mystery Man Is Finally Revealed In The Post-Credits 
Rio Is Dating Albert Moon
         

Throughout the duration of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, the identity of Rio&#39;s beau is kept a closely guarded secret. On a number of occasions, a dinner has been set up for an introduction; however, Miles&#39; responsibilities as Spider-Man often get in the way and result in him arriving late and missing his mother&#39;s gentleman caller. Though this does not cause a great deal of friction between the mother and son, some players likely have found the stringing out of this mystery to be deeply frustrating — especially as the name of the man, as well as his face and daughter&#39;s identity are not disclosed until Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s very final post-credit scene.

During this brief post-credit scene, it is revealed that Rio Morales is dating Albert Moon. Following her previous attempts to have them all to dinner, Rio finally introduces Miles to the man she&#39;s been dating. Though Rio refers to him simply as &#34;Albert,&#34; the subtitles reveal that his full name is Albert Moon. Though Albert Moon may be a name unfamiliar to many fans of the Spider-Man franchise, his daughter, Cindy Moon, whom he brings to the dinner, is a character far more widely known, especially by the name Silk. In the comics, Silk is granted powers by the same spider that bites Peter and possesses a similar skill set.




Though she has been featured in a number of video games, Silk first appeared in 2014 in the third comic book installment of The Amazing Spider-Man. While in the Spider-Man series of comics, the superhero, Silk, is a similar age to Peter Parker, in the final post-credit scene of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, she appears to be a similar age to Miles and Hailey. While only making a non-speaking cameo appearance in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, if Cindy Moon plays a part in a future in its sequel, as her appearance here may suggest, her backstory may be altered to fit within the canon of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series of video games.



 A Long Awaited Introduction 
Miles Meets Albert
          

While this long-awaited scene is incredibly brief, it is laden with an uncomfortable ambiance that seems very honest to most people&#39;s experience meeting new people under such awkward circumstances. Despite this, there is not an atmosphere of animosity, and while Rio seems incredibly nervous, Albert manages to charm Miles and Hailey through his slightly clumsy use of sign language. Following Albert&#39;s introduction and greetings, he introduces his obviously nervous daughter, Cindy. At the conclusion of the post-credit scene, the camera, facing Miles, Hailey, and Rio shows the three smiling at their guests prior to the screen finally fading to black




Though the identity of the man Rio has been dating is kept a secret throughout Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, the final reveal is incredibly sweet and, depending upon the player&#39;s patience, well worth the extended wait. After such a traumatic loss, with the death of Jefferson, it is deeply touching to see Rio find happiness once again; while the post-credit scene is brief, during the game, Miles seems supportive of his mother&#39;s attempts at finding love. Although it is almost impossible to predict how this blossoming relationship will progress throughout the inevitable sequel, hopefully, Rio and Albert&#39;s happiness will be enduring.
