 Pokémon TCG: 10 Paradox Rift Cards You&#39;ll Definitely Want To Collect 
Pokémon TCG’s upcoming Scarlet &amp; Violet: Paradox Rift expansion is introducing many new cards, including beautiful full-art collectible cards.













 








 10  Dottler 
Future Flash Card 67/66
        

Introduced to the franchise in Gen 8, Dottler is one of the cutest Bug-type Pokémon to ever be released. This sedentary Radome species may be an unusual choice for a Secret Rare card; however, the Future Flash Dottler is one of the most impressively designed cards in the set. Featuring four of these adorable insects on a small hill overlooking a town, the Future Flash Dottler Secret Rare card has a unique art style that is somewhat visually reminiscent of the Pointillism of the Impressionist painters Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Even if it is not a subtle homage to nineteenth-century Neo-impressionism, it is still a beautiful card. Dottler is numbered 67/66 in Future Flash, making it the first numbered Secret Rare in the set.





 9  Swablu 
Future Flash Card 76/66
        

Literally evocative of the children&#39;s game Duck Duck Goose, the Swablu Future Flash Secret Rare card is one of the cutest cards in the set. The card features an image of a row of Pelippers sitting on a small wall with extensive foliage - in the middle of this squadron of Pelippers is one adorable Swablu. While the Pelippers are looking off to the left, the Cotton Bird Pokémon, Swablu, seems oblivious to whatever has captivated its comrades as it is staring directly at the person holding the card. Outstanding art, unintentionally funny, and overall super cute, the Future Flash Swablu is undoubtedly a card that collectors will want ASAP.





 8  Steelix 
Future Flash Card 74/66


 







The evolved state of one of the franchise&#39;s most iconic Pokémon, Onix, Steelix is an Iron Snake species Pokémon. Steelix&#39;s Future Flash Secret Rare features some of the greatest art of any card in the set. Depicting Steelix on a busy construction site in a city, the card is exceptionally well-designed, and it is one of only a few examples in the Pokémon TCG to show Pokémon interacting with humans in a non-combat setting.





 7  Espathra 
Future Flash Card 73/66
        

Introduced in Gen 9, Espathra is a Psychic type, Ostrich species Pokémon. The Espathra&#39;s Future Flash Secret Rare is, put simply, majestic. Although the Pokémon itself looks fantastic, the main attraction is the stunning background which depicts what appears to be either a cataclysmic meteorological event or the rising or setting of the sun above the clouds. With a magnificent color palate that could stand up to any of the great masters&#39; depictions of heaven, the Future Flash Espathra Secret Rare is one that any self-respecting collector will absolutely need to have in their Pokémon TCG card collections.





 6  Toedscruel 
Future Flash Card 68/66
        

Though it may appear to be visually reminiscent of Tentacruel, the Toedscruel is a species of Woodear Pokémon and is as a result a Ground- and Grass-type, rather than a Water-type. Evolved from the Toedscool, the Future Flash Secret Rare Toedscruel is one of the best-designed Pokémon cards in the set. Featuring a vast number of these Woodear Pokémon in a gloomy and ambiance-laden forest, the Future Flash secret rare Toedscruel card masterfully juxtaposes the bright green Pokémon with their dark environment and the ominous red and purple evening sky. Furthermore, the close-up of a Toedscruel in the bottom right corner is pretty hilarious - although maybe not intentionally so.





 5  Aegislash ex 
Future Flash Card 82/66
        

Aegislash is a Royal Sword species Pokémon. Although it comes in two forms, Sheild Forme and Blade Forme, the Future Flash Aegislash ex Secret Rare card depicts the Blade Forme. Although there are many far more intricately designed cards in the set, the Aegislash ex excels in the simplicity of its artistic style. Featuring a large image of the Pokémon in front of a pink, orange, and red background, the Aegislash ex Secret Rare is not just a visually stunning card, it is also one of the strongest in the set - with an HP of 330 and some powerful attacks, Aegislash ex will likely be a card players will want ASAP.





 4  Iron Valiant ex 
Future Flash Card 80/66
        

Bearing a striking resemblance to Gardevoir and Gallade, the Gen 9 Paradox species Pokémon, Iron Valiant, is one of the coolest cards to be added in the Future Flash set. The Iron Valiant ex Secret Rare features an image of Iron Valiant in front of a very cool and pretty colorful background that masterfully juxtaposes with the green, pink, and white of the Iron Valiant itself. With a background dominated by black and purple, but with flashes of yellow, blue, and red, the Iron Valiant ex card emanates an aura of mystery - a thematically appropriate choice for a Paradox Pokémon.





 3  Toxtricity ex 
Future Flash Card 81/66


 







Toxtricity is an Electric- and Poison-type Pokémon that was introduced in Gen 8. With two forms, Amped Form and Low Key Form, the Punk species Pokémon is one of the highlights from its generation. Though it is difficult to tell which form is featured in the Toxtricity ex Secret Rare, the card itself is exceptionally well-designed. Featuring a Toxtricity that is colored in red, yellow, and purple, and depicted in a style reminiscent of stained-glass or rare gems, the Future Flash Toxtricity ex Secret Rare is beautiful and will undoubtedly be on the minds of collectors.





 2  Iron Jugulis 
Future Flash Card 78/66
        

Visually reminiscent of the Pokémon Hydreigon, Iron Jugulis is a Dark Flying-type Paradox species Pokémon. Added to the franchise during Gen 9, Iron Jugulis has one of the most unique Secret Rare cards in the Future Flash set. Set in a city at night, the card depicts Iron Jugulis above the streets, almost blending in with the starlight sky. Below the Pokémon, on the right, is a diner illuminated in neon, and across the street are, yet more buildings lit up with bright lights. Though the card&#39;s art shows a nighttime scene, the sky is partially illuminated with the orange and purple glow of the city beneath Iron Jugulis.





 1  Porygon-Z 
Future Flash Card 77/66


 







Though art is mostly subjective, it is almost undeniable that Gen 4&#39;s Porygon-Z is one of the most exceptionally well-designed Secret Rares in the Future Flash set. Set in a bedroom studio, full of instruments, computer equipment, and Pokémon references, the Porygon-Z Secret Rare has a busy design, but one in which every component fits and complements the scene. In the middle of the room, floating above the desk, Porygon-Z brings everything in the artwork together. This incredibly detailed card has so many exceptional touches, from the Porygon-Z-themed cap on the gaming chair to the Pikachu-shaped neon light on the shelf. This card is certainly one Pokémon TCG collectors will want ASAP.
