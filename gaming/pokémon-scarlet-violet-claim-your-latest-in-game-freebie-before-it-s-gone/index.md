## Literature Review

Nintendo is offering a free in-game reward for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players to celebrate the release of the game’s epilogue chapter.





Even though the story is concluded, the classic company revealed more details about the Epilogue’s mascot. The Mythical Pecharunt from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Epilogue has had its backstory shared, revealing more information about why it headed to the land of Kitakami in the first place and how it is connected to the rest of the campaign in The Teal Mask DLC. To celebrate the release of the Epilogue, Nintendo is giving out a unique and free Rotom Phone Case for Trainers.




                  How To Get Pecharunt In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Epilogue   Here’s how to unlock the encounter with Pecharunt in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, tips on how to beat it, and the best Poké Ball to catch it in.   


 Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: How To Get Kitakami Phone Case (Mystery Gift Code) 
          

The item that Nintendo is handing out is a special Neo-Kitkami Case for your Rotom Phone. This item was first revealed in a short promotional trailer for the epilogue in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, posted on the official Pokémon account on X. After seeing Pecharunt in action and what its toxic traits do to the people of Mossui Town in Kitakami, the trailer highlights the special Rotom Phone Case. The black and purple case features the silhouette of Ogerpon being chased down by the Loyal Three Legendary trio.




                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Epilogue Has A Secret Cutscene You Probably Missed   Players can miss out on a secret cutscene in the Epilogue for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet if they do not use a certain special Pokémon in battle.   

To claim the Neo-Kitakami Case, you will need to use the Mystery Gift feature. To access it, boot your game, open the main menu, and connect the title to the internet. Open the Poké Portal and head to the Mystery Gift button. Select the “Get with Code/Password” option upon clicking it. The Mystery Gift code for the Neo-Kitakami Case is NE0R0T0MC0VER. Upon claiming the “Clothing Gift” reward in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it should automatically be added to your cosmetic options.



The Mystery Gift feature does not allow the input of the letter O; thus, it is substituted by the number zero.







To equip the Neo-Kitakami Case, press the left button on your D-Pad to open up the cosmetic customization options, and head over to the Rotom Phone section. You can scroll down there until you find the desired option, equip it, and exit. There is no deadline for the redemption of the Mystery Gift, but Nintendo has informed that it may end the distribution of the Neo-Kitakami Case without prior notice. As such, it is best to claim the reward in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as soon as possible.
