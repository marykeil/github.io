# One Glaring Cyberpunk 2077 Omission Could Flesh Out The World


## SUMMARY 



  Expanding wealthy areas like North Oak can provide a different side to the gritty world of Night City.   The inclusion of tourist destinations in the Phantom Liberty expansion already gives players a taste of the high life.   Exploring wealthy areas can delve into Night City&#39;s classist structure and provide V with new high-paying gigs.

## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077 allows players to dive into the rich, seedy world of Night City, but one, less crime-ridden district has potential for an expansion.




Cyberpunk 2077 allows players to dive into the rich, seedy world of Night City, and while its expansion, Phantom Liberty, added an extra level with the tourist destination-turned-combat zone, Dogtown, there is still one area that could flesh out the world even further. The expansion of wealthier areas such as North Oak in Night City.




[Warning: This article contains some spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077]Although Corpos do reside in Night City, and players can visit upper-class establishments such as penthouses or corporate offices, a lot of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s gigs and missions dive into the seedier underbelly of the city. Mercs can be seen scrambling for jobs to make whatever money they can, trying - and often failing - to pull themselves up from a life of gang crime and make a name for themselves, with V&#39;s friend Jackie Welles being a prime example.

                  Cyberpunk 2077’s Coolest Gang Has A Tragic Origin Story   Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Night City is the home to many gangs, each with their own rich history. The youngest of which has its origins steeped in tragedy.   


 A North Oak Expansion Could Dive Into A Different Side Of Night City 
Criminals Were Removed From The Area By Force
         




North Oak is the newest part of Night City, and was previously the site of temporary refugee camps and favelas following the Arasaka Headquarters Bombing. In the early 2050s, the NC government, backed by the megacorporations, declared a &#34;war against crime&#34; and decided to clear the area by force to transform it into a home for the untouchable elite.

The exclusive residential district is home to rockstar Kerry Eurodyne, his former Samurai drummer Denny, the Arasaka Estate, and other notable villas and mansions. This variety in residents&#39; backgrounds proves that its entry requirements aren&#39;t concerned with whether someone&#39;s a rebellious Rockerboy or a Corpo CEO, so long as they are wealthy.

As the area is largely free from the poverty and gangs that plague the rest of Night City, there often isn&#39;t as much cause for V to visit as there is for other areas. Despite this, there is still plenty of potential in expanding upon such a wealthy district to show a very different side to life in the city.




                  Cyberpunk 2077: Every District Ranked Worst To Best   Each of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s districts provide players with a unique experience, but some areas of the dystopian Night City simply outshine others.   



 Phantom Liberty&#39;s Dogtown Was Originally Meant To Bring In Wealthy Tourists 
But Several Attractions Have Been Abandoned
         

There is a glimpse of this idea within the Phantom Liberty expansion through the game&#39;s inclusion of Dogtown. Dogtown was originally intended as a place for the wealthy to visit within the Pacifica district called Serenisands in the 2050s, with the original concept for the location seemingly taking some inspiration from Las Vegas.



Unfortunately, megacorps such as Militech had already used the location to build underground bunkers and laboratories, and when this led to a large explosion beneath one of the construction sites, the Night City Council walled off the area.







Several of the potential tourist destinations, such as the Eventide Resort &amp; Spa, the Heavy Hearts Club, the EBM Petrochem Stadium, and the Black Sapphire Club still remain in some form, either being reopened by Dogtown&#39;s tyrannical ruler, Kurt Hansen, or allowed to fall into a state of disarray. In one particular mission where V and Reed infiltrate Hansen&#39;s private event in the Black Sapphire Club, it&#39;s evident that some of Night City&#39;s wealthiest still frequent the establishment​​​​​.

Throughout Phantom Liberty, V can visit the Egyptian-themed Heavy Hearts Club, which is also frequented by Dogtown&#39;s elite. Here they can get jobs from Mr Hands, visiting the notoriously enigmatic fixer in person for the first time. While Dogtown is largely run down like most of the rest of Night City, these locations already give players a better taste of the high life.

                  Best Bars In Cyberpunk 2077, Ranked By Vibes   Hanging out in a bar in Cyberpunk 2077, getting a drink and listening to the conversations, or chatting with the bartender can be an immersive treat.   






 Expanding Wealthy Areas Could Better Explore Night City&#39;s Classist Structure 
And Provide V With Even More Gigs
          

Coming from the crime-ridden streets of Night City into wealthier areas is always a bit of a culture shock in Cyberpunk 2077, but themes of wealth and power are prevalent throughout its story and some of the key dynamics in the game. Toward the end of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s campaign, V has begun to make a name for themselves. Depending on how many gigs they take and what optional objectives they complete, they can amass a fair amount of Eurodollars.

Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s &#34;The Sun&#34; ending, for instance, sees V finally amass great wealth, living in an impressive penthouse before embarking upon one final heist that will make them a legend of the Afterlife. Despite amassing this wealth, however, V is still heavily tied to the main part of Night City, and is still frequenting bars such as the Afterlife, which V can end up running depending on players&#39; decisions.




Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 1.5 Update added four new properties for V to purchase in other areas, with the 2.0 update increasing their prices, and these showed various levels of wealth within Night City and offered a glimpse into how each area lived. The cheapest in Watson is now available for $10000, and the most expensive within Corpo Plaza costs $110,000. However, there was never an option to purchase somewhere in North Oak.



Other than the Megabuilding that V has their default apartment in, they can purchase apartments in Northside, Japantown, The Glen, and Corpo Plaza. Phantom Liberty also comes with a new hideout on Kress Street in Dogtown.




Purchasing a mansion or villa in North Oak would only contribute to these themes while also branching out by letting V enter and reside in a world that&#39;s vastly different from the rest of the game. Adding attractions typical of such an area in the real world, but not so common within Cyberpunk 2077, such as country clubs, could see V dealing with a new group of elites.






The North Oak Casino &amp; Country Club can be seen on the hills in northeastern North Oak in Cyberpunk 2077. Unfortunately, it is inaccessible, as the tunnel leading to it is closed off. Many speculated it may be opened in new DLC, but this never happened.




These gigs would most likely be corporate-based, involving espionage to defeat competitors. This would also be extremely fitting for those who have chosen the Corpo lifepath, as their version of V is already well acquainted with the upper echelon. Of course, considering the aforementioned variety in North Oak&#39;s residents and their lifestyles, this could vary, providing a range of new activities whilst rubbing shoulders with some of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s most elite citizens.

              Cyberpunk 2077  Based on the 1988 tabletop game, Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person action RPG game set in a dystopian cyber future developed by CD Projekt Red. Players will tackle the streets of Night City as customizable protagonist V, who struggles to keep their memories intact after receiving a strange cybernetic implant that slowly overrides their memories by a deceased celebrity known as Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves.
