## Literature Review

There are three different Blueprints you can unlock in The Last Faith, with every one of them in locations that can be hard to find on your large map.





There are 3 Blueprints you can collect, which may all be handed over to the NPC Mariano to create new items in his shop. Similar to other loot you uncover, like The Federal Admiral&#39;s Cannon in The Last Faith, every set of plans is found inside a large chest. Many of the places where these chests are located are guarded by tons of enemies, so make sure you are prepared ahead of time to face these foes.

  Blueprint   Location   How to Find   Map Image    Prototype Blueprint   The Esk Mansion   Go through the Locked Door that leads to the broken-off area of the Mansion. In the room to the bottom left, in a hidden study, you&#39;ll find the Blueprint in a large chest below a clock.                           Rare Prototype Blueprint   Liturgical Pass   Past another Locked Door near the middle of the region, which can be seen at the bottom right of a larger area. Down the stairs past the door is a walkway filled with enemies, with the Blueprint in the chest at the end to your left.                           Barsov&#39;s Prototype Blueprint   The Junas Ministry   Reach the top railing of the largest room in this area, then use your Double Jump ability to leap onto the top right chandelier. The Blueprints are seen as an orb item on top of the decoration.                          



Bringing back these Blueprints to Mariano will give you access to new items and tools you couldn&#39;t use before. The Prototype Blueprints give you a Key Item that Mariano can use to upgrade your weapons. Meanwhile, the Rare Prototype Blueprint adds the powerful Firearm weapon Leena&#39;s Bow in The Last Faith to Mariano&#39;s shop, which can be bought for 9,500 Nycrux.




Finally, Barsov&#39;s Prototype Blueprints serve as the next stage to weapon enhancements, allowing you to modify your tools to even greater heights. Once you unlock every Blueprint in The Last Faith, you should try to upgrade your favorite weapon to its maximum potential if you have enough Nycrux.
