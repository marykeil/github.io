## Literature Review

Organically breeding Blue Axolotls in Minecraft is extremely difficult to do. Alternatively, these rare creatures can be spawned via console commands.





Since Axolotls have such a low spawn rate, the Blue variant can be spawned in an alternative way. While this method is technically cheating, the console command can make the process much easier. This method works on both Java and Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. It is worth pointing out that enabling the Console Command will disable achievements on both the PC and Consoles.






Cheats for all Minecraft versions can be enabled within the creation screen of a world. Alternatively, those who&#39;ve already spawned into a world seed can open their settings and activate cheats by searching for it in the menu&#39;s screen and ensuring that cheats are &#34;on.&#34;





 Spawning a Blue Axolotl in Java Edition 
          

For PC players using the Java Edition of Minecraft, you can open the command console by hitting the &#34;/&#34; key. This will let you add any command and use cheats in Minecraft. The command for spawning the Blue Axolotl is &#34;/summon minecraft:axolotl ~ ~ ~ {Variant:4}.&#34; 



There is a chance that the Axolotl will not spawn right in front of you. In that case, look around with the camera view to find the mob. 









 Spawning a Blue Axolotl in Bedrock Edition 
          

As for Minecraft Bedrock Edition players, you can add a Blue Axolotl to their world by opening Chat and Commands and inputting, &#34;/summon axolotl ~ ~ ~ minecraft:entity_born.&#34; Within several moments, a Blue Axolotl should successfully appear. Additionally, both Java and Bedrock should bear in mind that Axolotls need water to thrive and will not survive very long on dry land. Therefore, ensure you are spawning the cuddly creature near a body of water for the Blue Axolotl to swim in.



 How To Breed Blue Axolotls 
          

If you would rather breed your own Blue Axolotls in Minecraft than spawn them via console commands and want recognition in the form of in-game achievements, you can do so. As suggested earlier, Blue Axolotls are extremely rare to find; however, you will need at least a pair of Axolotls (of any color) to get started with breeding them. Once you have two Blue Axolotls, you can feed them a bucket of Tropical Fish to breed them.






Feeding Axolotls regular Tropical Fish will not result in them breeding. You will need to use a Bucket of Tropical Fish every time.




However, it is worth pointing out that you will need patience to get a Blue Axolotl, as you will need to repeat the breeding process numerous times in Minecraft.
