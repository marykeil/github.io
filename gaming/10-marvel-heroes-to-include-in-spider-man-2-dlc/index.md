## SUMMARY 


 Insomniac Games&#39; 
Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2

 With Spider-Man&#39;s long run in comic books, there are plenty of characters familiar to the web-head, which would be perfect additions to

## Literature Review

Any upcoming DLC for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 should include some big names, fan-favorites, and familiar faces that Insomniac has not introduced yet.




Insomniac Games&#39; Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 for PlayStation 5 is filled with Easter eggs and character guest appearances. Part of the series&#39; allure has always been finding these secrets and interacting with fan-favorite characters. Now, with Miles Morales being a main character in the series and not simply a spin-off or guest himself, Insomniac has a big job for any upcoming DLC to continue to expand the cast of characters.
Luckily, the Marvel Universe does not lack characters to choose from, and it&#39;s hard to even think of any characters who have not interacted with Spider-Man at some point over the decades. With team-ups, spin-offs, and crossover events, Insomniac could (and should) bring in X-Men, Avengers, and people from across the Spider-Verse to its version of Spidey&#39;s New York.
            
 
 &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review 
Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.













 








 10  Iron Fist Could Learn From The Spider-Men 
Alter Ego Of Danny Rand
        

Despite his incredibly poor showing on Netflix, Iron Fist is a staple of Spider-Man&#39;s New York City. Even though he has a mystical, flaming punch attack that would make even Venom reconsider his plans, Iron Fist has not always made the best decisions or use of his powers. Depending on which age of Iron Fist would be introduced in the Spider-Man 2 DLC, a younger version would be a prime candidate for coaching and mentoring from Peter Parker, or even Miles Morales as he takes on a more central role and gains experience and wisdom he can pass on.





 9  Captain America Is From Brooklyn 
Alter Ego Of Steve Rogers


 







Avengers Tower is one of the most prominent buildings in Spider-Man 2, and Captain America is one of its most prominent residents. Cap and Spidey have crossed paths numerous times over the years, both as friends and as foes. Given that the Insomniac Spider-Man universe has Peter well-established as the wall-crawler even before the first game begins, if there were one NY-based superhero he definitely would have come into contact with, it would be Captain America.
The Avengers themselves, however, have been conspicuously absent from the Insomniac games. In broad terms, that&#39;s intentional to keep the focus on the Spider-Men. Captain America showing up in a DLC episode would be just the kind of Avengers-level cameo that would make sense and not derail the narrative or take focus off the title characters.
            
 
 Why The Avengers Aren&#39;t In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 
Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 doesn&#39;t seem to address where the Avengers are, but an explanation has already been given through a surprising avenue.









 8  Punisher Originated From Spider-Man Comics 
Alter Ego Of Frank Castle
        

The Punisher was introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #129 in 1974. He was originally hired to kill Spider-Man by the Jackal, but by the end of the issue, realizes that the title character isn&#39;t irrevocably evil and doesn&#39;t deserve to be killed. While they&#39;re not exactly friends because of differences in moral codes and crime-fighting choices, Spider-Man and the Punisher have teamed up enough times in comics and other video games to make it feasible for Frank Castle to appear in Spider-Man 2 DLC, though Peter or Miles would have to ensure he kept the safety on at all times.





 7  Daredevil Has Already Been Teased In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 
Alter Ego Of Matt Murdock
        

There are a lot of reasons why Daredevil may make an appearance in Spider-Man 2 DLC. Not only is Matt Murdock, Daredevil&#39;s alter ego, Peter Parker&#39;s lawyer in the MCU, but in the first installment of the Insomniac series, players can find an office for Nelson &amp; Murdock, the law firm he works at. In the second game, there are hints at the Hand being in New York, and they are a major threat to Daredevil in all media he&#39;s appeared in.
The two heroes have also always shared villains, since their home turf tends to overlap. Most notable is the Kingpin, who plays a major role in the first Insomniac game, both as a tutorial villain and omnipresent foe, with players needing to clear his safe-houses across the city. If the Kingpin rears his head in the upcoming DLC, there is a very good chance that Daredevil will, too.

 6  Spider-Woman Could Emerge From A Spider-Verse Portal 
Alter Ego Of Jessica Drew
        

Jessica Drew would be a perfect inclusion for Spider-Man 2 DLC not only because she&#39;s powerful, strong, and interesting, but also because she made a huge splash with movie-going audiences in Across the Spider-Verse. Like many other Spider-People, she was bitten by a spider, but it wasn&#39;t radioactive. Her father&#39;s antivenin serum is what granted her powers.
There are lots of ways an espionage-oriented character like her could be included in the Insomniac universe narratively. And that goes for her Across the Spider-Verse self or the Earth-616 comics version. Plus, there&#39;s a spider-verse portal players can find in Spider-Man 2, giving a perfect place for Jessica Drew&#39;s Spider-Woman to emerge from.





 5  Spider-Gwen (AKA Ghost-Spider, Or Spider-Woman) 
Alter Ego Of Gwen Stacy


 







Spider-Gwen, also known as Ghost-Spider and occasionally Spider-Woman, became a fan-favorite almost immediately upon introduction. Marvel knew it, too, even saying she was &#34;your new favorite&#34; in the first panel she appeared in issue nine of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2014. She has one of the best costumes in the Spider-Verse, and would fit right in with the Spider-Man 2 universe. She has a strong relationship with Miles Morales in the Spider-Verse films, and the Easter egg portal in the game would be a great place for her to pop out of and continue their friendship.





 4  Wolverine Is Already Getting A Game In Insomniac&#39;s Marvel Universe 
Alter Ego Of James Howlett, Alias Logan
        

Insomniac has stated that Wolverine is part of a shared universe with the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games, and there would be no better way to tie the two games together than have Wolverine show up in a DLC pack for Spider-Man 2. For players unaware of the connection, Logan showing up as a prelude to his own game could definitely build a lot of excitement. Spider-Man and Logan have teamed up many times in various media already. A DLC appearance would make sense solely because of that. Plus, it would be a nice way to introduce the X-Men in general to the Insomniac universe.





 3  Firestar Is One Of Spider-Man&#39;s Amazing Friends 
Alter Ego Of Angelica Jones
        

Firestar&#39;s association with Spider-Man is thanks to the 1980s television series Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends. Alongside Iceman of the X-Men, Firestar joined Spidey and fought crimes, solved mysteries, and learned life lessons. Even a cameo from Firestar in Spider-Man 2 DLC would delight &#39;80s kids, as well as be the kind of Easter egg that players who have never seen the TV series would have to look up and wonder how it got made in the first place.





 2  Ms. Marvel &amp; Spider-Man Are Already Friends In Marvel Comics 
Alter Ego Of Kamala Khan


 







Miles and Kamala Khan are longtime friends. They&#39;ve been members of the Champions superteam together since 2016, fostering a strong friendship and fighting crime together. They are also great at working as a team to find peaceful ways to solve problems without punching them. With Kamala Khan being just south of New York in Jersey City, she could easily and reasonably make an appearance in Spider-Man 2 DLC. Her friendship with Miles could already be established, too, much like The Tinkerer was in Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Approaching it this way would allow the relationship to advance further in the shorter time DLC can allot for narrative.

 1  Deadpool Was Based On Spider-Man 
Alter Ego Of Wade Wilson
        

Rob Liefeld, Deadpool&#39;s creator, has explicitly stated that Deadpool was based on Spider-Man. In an interview with Vulture, Liefeld said, &#34;the entire intent with Deadpool&#34; was that &#34;he&#39;s Spider-Man, except with guns and swords.&#34; Since then, the character has become so much more than that, but at heart, the two characters remain tied together exactly how Liefeld imagined: they &#34;make fun of you or punch you in the face and make small cracks.&#34;
The writing in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is punchy already, with quips flying from a Spider-Man&#39;s mouth every few punches. The game engine is already perfect for players step into the merc with a mouth&#39;s shoes. Additionally, the costume and style system is the perfect opportunity for DLC content, like a taco costume or six-foot-tall chimichanga suit.
