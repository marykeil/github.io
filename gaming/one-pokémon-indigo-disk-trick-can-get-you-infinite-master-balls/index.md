## Literature Review

The Indigo Disk DLC offers all Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players the chance to have an unlimited supply of highly-coveted Master Balls.




Making use of one useful trick in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC can give people access to an unending supply of Master Balls. In addition to a variety of new Pokémon, The Indigo Disk offers several new features with a variety of uses. Taking advantage of one of these allows people to earn more of the Pokémon franchise’s most powerful Poké Balls.




It is unsurprising that Master Balls are typically in short supply in any Pokémon game, given that they render a core part of the gameplay loop effectively redundant. With the inescapable Master Ball, there is no need to consider how best to weaken a Pokémon, whether to risk one more attack or begin throwing the best Poké Balls available in earnest. Of course, they are also incredibly convenient, especially when facing Legendaries with low catch rates. And as The Indigo Disk features many Legendary Pokémon from across the franchise to find, extra Master Balls can save plenty of time when trying to catch them all.

                  Why Perrin Is Missing In Your Indigo Disk DLC For Scarlet &amp; Violet   Although Perrin is an important character in The Indigo Disk, some players may not be able to find her, cutting off access to certain rare Pokémon.   


 The Item Printer Offers Unlimited Master Balls When Upgraded In The Indigo Disk 
          




One of the upgrades available for the League Club Room at Blueberry Academy is the Item Printer, which converts TM Materials and BP into various items. The Item Printer itself can be upgraded several times as it is used, with its second ‘Ultra Ball’ upgrade unlocking the Poké Ball Lotto. As the name suggests, this is a randomized collection of Poké Balls which has a 1% chance of replacing the usual Item Printer results. The Poké Ball Lotto has a small chance to produce some very rare Poké Balls, including the Master Ball with a draw rate of approximately 0.75%, according to Serebii.



 The Indigo Disk Makes Even The Toughest Of Pokémon Captures Simple 
          

There are three Master Balls that can be acquired simply through regular play of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and its DLC. One is obtained from Director Clavell after completing &#34;The Way Home,&#34; and two more are available in The Indigo Disk DLC: one for defeating Kieran, and another for filling 240 entries in the Blueberry Pokédex. Of course, that is not nearly enough to capture all the Legendary Pokémon in the game, but investing in the Item Printer can make up the difference. And with BBQs encouraging people to defeat and capture a variety of Pokémon, it is easy to gather plenty of BP and materials to use the Item Printer and take advantage of the lotto.




Even a single Master Ball can be an incredibly valuable resource in any Pokémon game, so the Item Printer’s capabilities are understandably a notable boon. With all that is included in the Indigo Disk DLC, having the ability to capture even the strongest of Pokémon with ease is an incredible advantage. Of course, there is a notable level of time, effort, and luck involved in working the Item Printer, but for such potent items this only seems fair. The Poké Ball Lotto is a small but incredibly useful feature for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, with the potential to give people an unlimited number of Master Balls.
