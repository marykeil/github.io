 How To Find Harris&#39; IP Address In Cyberpunk 2077 
          

Once you start investigating, you will find a laptop belonging to Rivers&#39; Nephew. It seems that Randy was emailing a man named Harris repeatedly, and it quickly becomes apparent that Harris is the one who kidnapped Randy. River will ask you to find out his IP address so that you can locate Harris. 

If you have an Intelligence rating of twelve, you will be able to break into the Laptop and get Harris&#39; IP address. If you don&#39;t have sufficient Intelligence points in your Perk Tree in Cyberpunk 2077, you will need to find the Laptop&#39;s password. The clue for the password can be found in the hallway by the record players. If you were unable to figure out the riddle, the password is Liberum Arbitrium.




Once you have access to the Laptop, click on the &#34;Net&#34; tab at the top of the screen. I will open an image that contains two people. Click on this image, and you should be on Tony&#39;s Shelter&#39;s webpage. Click on the &#34;Files&#34; tab, and you will get an ERROR: &#34;ATT_CART_VIDEO&#34; FILE NOT FOUND message. Click on the &#34;Files&#34; tab again and load the ATT_CART_VIDEO file.

After following these steps, you will be able to get Harris&#39; IP address if you have enough Hacking skill points. If you have an Intelligence rating of 12, you will get a dialogue option that will let you respond to River&#39;s question with &#34;Definitely.&#34; This will let you retrieve Harris&#39; IP address. 



If you don&#39;t have Level 12 Intelligence, you will not be able to retrieve the IP address, but the quest still carries on with the same outcome.




If you manage to snag the IP address, River will say that this places Harris&#39; location somewhere on the outskirts of Night City, but you still won&#39;t have an exact location to pin down. Either way, you will then have to continue the investigation by examining some braindances later on.




By gaining clues from the braindances, you can then able to pinpoint the exact place that Harris is holding Randy, so ultimately, the IP address winds up being fairly useless. It is a pretty good way to practice hacking, though, and gives you the opportunity to romance Rivers in Cyberpunk 2077.
