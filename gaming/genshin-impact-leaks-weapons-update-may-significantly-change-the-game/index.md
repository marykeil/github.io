## SUMMARY

The leak suggests that 5-star weapons may be added to the store, potentially allowing players to directly purchase desired weapons instead of relying on the gacha system.   This update could help counter the game&#39;s problematic weapons banner, making it easier for players to obtain the weapons they want and potentially reducing spending on the gacha system.

## Literature Review

A new leak suggests that an update will offer players better options when trying to acquire 5-star weapons for their characters in Genshin Impact.




An update to the weapons system was mentioned in new Genshin Impact leaks, and the information shared hints at a groundbreaking tweak. The popular action RPG by developer HoYoverse has been bombarded by leaks for some time now, and that has not stopped. Before the release of Fontaine in Version 4.0, most of its content and characters had already leaked, months prior, from players who had access to test versions of the patch. As a live-service title, the game continues to have tests before the release of updates and, with it, leaks that spoil some of the upcoming content.




A great example of this is Gaming’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact. The new Pyro character’s abilities were allegedly revealed, from his Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Skill, to his passive Talents and even Constellation levels. The same occurred with Xianyun, the human form of Cloud Retainer, ahead of her release in Version 4.4. Even with HoYoverse’s legal measures against leakers, a lot of information about the game still gets out – and is likely to continue doing so. This time around, a leaker mentioned a significant update to the weapon’s system, which may impact the entire game.

                  New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.   


 Genshin Impact May Add 5-Star Weapons To The Store 
          




According to some new information by the leaker known as Little Teyvat, later shared by a user on Reddit, HoYoverse will allegedly add some of the 5-star weapons to the store. As seen in the leak, these weapons may be commercialized to players in the form of gift packages in Genshin Impact. This means that players may be able to directly purchase the 5-star weapons that they want from the store rather than using the gacha system to obtain them. The leak does not mention a specific date or version in which this update to the weapon’s system would occur.



On Reddit, the leak is tagged as suspicious rather than reliable. As is the case with any leak, the details about the addition of 5-star weapons to the store should be taken with a grain of salt.






 Paid 5-Star Weapons Can Help Counter Genshin Impact’s Problematic Weapons Banner 
         




If the leak is, in fact, true, the addition of 5-star weapons to the store may be a way of countering one of the game’s biggest issue. Currently, the weapons banner features two 5-star weapons at once. This makes for a hard time acquiring the desired weapon. When pulling for a 5-star weapon at their maximum pity rate, players have a 50% chance of getting one of the two featured 5-star weapons, and a 50% chance of obtaining a random 5-star weapon from the regular pool in Genshin Impact. As such, they have to beat the first round of odds.

Other than that, they have another dispute: beating the odds of getting the desired 5-star weapon among the two that are simultaneously featured. The weapons banner has a special mechanism that ensures the desired drop after two failed 5-star pulls. This means that, if players get two 5-star pulls that are not marked as their goal, their next 5-star pull in Genshin Impact will be the weapon they. However, it’s possible for players to pull nearly 240 times from the weapons banner and not obtain what they are looking for since the hard pity for 5-star pulls is 80 wishes.






The special system that ensures the player’s desired weapon is called Epithomized Path. Players establish which of the two featured weapons they want and, after gathering two Fate Points (each point comes from receiving a 5-star weapon that is not the one they chose), they are ensured the weapon of their choice on the next 5-star pull.




If weapons are added to the store as paid gift packs, then it may facilitate their acquisition. Instead of having to pull hundreds of times and possibly failing, players can go ahead and get what they want directly, even if through a paid premium package. Of course, it has yet to be determined whether HoYoverse is adding limited-time weapons to the gift shop or only those that are in the regular loot pool in Genshin Impact. If this update does not include signature weapons for limited-time characters, then the options will be a lot more restricted.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Trials Are Finally Getting A Lot Better   Leaks indicate a small update to character trials in Genshin Impact 4.4, which may end up being a game-changing decision for players in the future.   






 Why 5-Star Weapons Are Being Added To The Store In Genshin Impact 
          

Although it has yet to be determined if the leak is actually true, the suggested update to the weapon’s system does not come across as too surprising. The game is going through some changes with its quality-of-life features, and weapons in the shop seem like a way of countering its most punitive mechanics. Not only that, but this alleged new update to Genshin Impact seems to fall partially in line with the most recent developments in China’s legislation towards gaming and gacha games, specifically. Players&#39; spending and product prices are the current adjustment target.

The newly discussed legislation aims to decrease the amount of time and money that players spend in games, and one such measure is restricting daily login promotions. As such, it is possible that the Blessing of Welkin login pack may suffer some consequences. With the intention of addressing high spending through the weapons banner, it is possible that HoYoverse’s measure is offering these featured 5-star weapons through a special gift pack in the store. This would offer players a way of avoiding all the possible expenses with the tough pities and pull rates in Genshin Impact.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   

This update to the weapon’s system, however, may be unrelated to the new legislation in China that counters abusive monetary spending in games. It may, alternatively, be a way of bringing the game up to speed with other gacha titles. HoYoverse’s other RPG, Honkai: Star Rail, also has 5-star weapons in its store – they are, however, purchasable with in-game currency obtained from pulls and are limited to the weapons from its standard pool rather than its premium 5-star weapons. Considering the leak’s reliability, this could instead be the case for Genshin Impact as opposed to paid gift packs.



Some of the details about China’s most recent measures against spending in games are reported by Reuters.







So far, it is too late to determine exactly how this leaked update will work, or even if it will be included at all. With the updates to China’s stance on gaming still in development and the upcoming patches themselves still undergoing tests, there is a chance for the changes to the weapon’s system to be completely discarded or highly altered before its actual release. Regardless, a change of such a nature would be a huge boon for players who often spend a lot of time and money trying to get the ideal weapons for their characters in Genshin Impact.
