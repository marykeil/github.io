# One Key Thing Makes Starfield So Much Better On PC


## SUMMARY 



  One feature on PC greatly enhances the Starfield experience, offering solutions to shortcomings and adding content not available on consoles.   Support for this feature is planned for Xbox, but it has not yet been implemented, leaving Xbox players to rely on community fixes and missing out on the full potential of mods.   The PC version of Starfield will always have a greater catalog of custom content, making it the superior platform to enjoy the game.

## Literature Review

Starfield&#39;s Xbox and PC versions are reasonably competitive in many regards, but there&#39;s one major difference that makes the PC experience superior.




Starfield is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives of this generation, but there&#39;s a major reason why playing it on console just can&#39;t stack up against the PC experience. The current console generation has made some big strides to catch up with technological advancements available on high-end PCs, with support for features like ray-tracing and increased options for higher framerates and resolutions. That doesn&#39;t mean that the playing field is always completely even, however, and graphics aren&#39;t the only area where the PC release of a game might be able to outstrip its console counterpart.




The overall response to Starfield has been somewhat divisive, with a fair share of ardent champions and determined detractors alike. In some regards, the game manages to translate engaging aspects of Bethesda&#39;s game design to the impressive scale of outer space, but compromises, limitations, and repetitive elements make the experience feel less than it could have been. It&#39;s always possible that the planned Shattered Space DLC could make some improvements, but if there&#39;s anything consistent about Bethesda games, it&#39;s that the best fixes tend to come from outside the studio.

 Mod Support Makes Starfield Better On PC 
         




The biggest difference between the Xbox Series X/S and PC versions of Starfield doesn&#39;t come from officially supported features but from the work that the PC community is doing to mod the game. Thanks to tools like Nexus Mod Manager and Vortex, it&#39;s easy to install third-party Starfield mods on a PC with minimal technological expertise. Many PC players are already comfortable with the process thanks to the extensive popularity of mods for The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, and it&#39;s no surprise that Starfield has received plenty of support in the months since its September 2023 release.

Many of the best mods for Starfield focus on addressing basic shortcomings or rethinking design choices in the interest of overall quality of life. Streamlined inventory menus or configurable UI can save time and heighten immersion, even if they aren&#39;t as exciting as total overhaul mods. Other options add support for better upscaling and framerate solutions or tackle bugs that have been left unpatched. Many crucial solutions were available within days of the game&#39;s PC launch, and given enough time, Starfield should see more and more content additions and graphical game-changers from the modding community.






 Starfield Mods Are Coming To Xbox In 2024 
          

Although most games don&#39;t feature mod support on consoles whatsoever, Bethesda has actually put an emphasis on the feature in recent years. Mods have contributed heavily to the incredible longevity of Skyrim, and implementing platforms that allow console users to install some tweaks and overhauls help sell new copies of games and maintain investment in franchises. Even before Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda, the Xbox was the best console destination for mods, as PlayStation has harsher restrictions and Nintendo hasn&#39;t supported mod platforms whatsoever.

In keeping with this idea, Xbox mod support is a planned feature for Starfield; it just hasn&#39;t been implemented yet. As reported by Gamespot, Bethesda&#39;s head of publishing, Pete Hines, said that mods would be available on both PC and Xbox, and an official Bethesda blog post from late 2023 promised the release of a Creation Kit and exporter in early 2024. It&#39;s unfortunate that there&#39;s no specific date yet, as Xbox fans might end up waiting six months or more after Starfield&#39;s launch to see any mods for the game, but it&#39;s good to know that it&#39;s being worked on.




                  One Huge Starfield Addition Would Make Base Building Actually Worth It   One of the best mechanics in Starfield could get a lot better with the implementation of a gameplay system from a well-known franchise.   

Regardless, it can be frustrating for Xbox players to deal with a lack of options that are readily available on another platform, especially when Bethesda seems to be relying on these community fixes to address a number of common complaints. Wrangling frustrating menus or running into a familiar bug is more annoying when a solution is just out of reach, and the overall stagnation compares unfavorably to the continuous post-launch patch work being done on Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and other titles. The value of Starfield&#39;s exclusivity is ultimately somewhat reduced when it ends up being an inferior way to play the game.



 Starfield Mods On Xbox Will Never Catch Up To PC 
          




It&#39;s likely that the Xbox Series X/S will receive the lion&#39;s share of current basic fixes for Starfield once mod support is available, but the harsh reality is that the game will never feature the same degree of support that can be found on PC. Console modding solutions are never as extensive as what can be done on PC, limiting the type of work that&#39;s possible, and an overall smaller modding community means that the volume of content will simply be less. That doesn&#39;t mean that overall availability will be flimsy, but it does mean that the PC version will still have more to offer in future years.



Another concern with the Xbox modding scene for Starfield is Skyrim&#39;s integration of paid mods, which has a bigger impact on the console side of things.




Mods don&#39;t necessarily have to make or break the enjoyment of Starfield, and the game was able to generate overall critical acclaim before any improvements were available. The fact that Xbox is set to receive them at all would probably shock console gamers from a decade ago, so there&#39;s certainly a temptation to frame the situation as looking a gift horse in the mouth. It&#39;s also not all sunshine and roses on the PC side of things, as the abandonment of a major multiplayer mod out of disinterest in the game, shows that it might not receive the same long-term love as Skyrim.




Regardless, the modding scene for Starfield is currently active and exciting overall, and it&#39;s a shame that none of it has yet become available on Xbox. It&#39;s still a solid way to play the game, and the lack of any real performance issues means that it can actually be a more stable experience than on PC. When it comes to a head-to-head, however, it&#39;s impossible to ignore that the advantage is fully in the court of Starfield&#39;s PC release, thanks to everything that mods have to offer.
