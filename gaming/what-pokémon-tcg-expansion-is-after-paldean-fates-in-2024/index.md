## Literature Review

Pokémon TCG’s next expansion, Paldean Fates, releases at the end of January, and Trainers won’t have to wait long for another set to follow.




Pokémon Trainers for the Pokémon Trading Card Game can look forward to a good start to 2024, with not only the upcoming shiny-focused expansion Paldean Fates, but another new expansion shortly thereafter. The popular TCG is currently focusing on cards that are based on the most current video game entries, Scarlet and Violet, with both Pokémon and game mechanics that are similar to what is seen there. Now, a new expansion could be seen in the upcoming months, with ties to the Paradox theme that occurs in the games.




Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates is scheduled to be released on January 26, 2024, and will focus primarily on shiny variants of Pokémon. This English set is launching the same day that two Japanese sets, Wild Force and Cyber Judge, are debuting, which provides hints as to what the next English expansion following Paldean Fates will be. Traditionally, new Pokémon TCG sets are released roughly every three months, and that trend appears to be continuing now for the next expansion following Paldean Fates.

                  Pokémon TCG: Paldean Fates - Release Date, New Cards, &amp; Special Sets Info   Paldean Fates, the first Pokémon TCG expansion of 2024 has been revealed, along with its release date, new cards to expect, and special sets.   


 Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces Will Be The Next Expansion 
          




At the time of writing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game has not officially announced Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces, and therefore, information gleaned so far has come from PokéBeach. According to PokéBeach, the Temporal Forces set will be released on March 22, 2024, and will be composed of cards from the Japanese sets Wild Force and Cyber Judge. For this reason, it is speculated that this set could include many of the Paradox Pokémon species, particularly Iron Leaves and Walking Wake, which are posed as the featured cover images for the Japanese sets. The new set will also include ACE SPEC cards, which are powerful cards that have the rule that only one ACE SPEC card can be included per deck.



 Temporal Forces Will Launch With New Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets 
          

Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces is also expected to happen alongside two Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets featuring Koraidon ex and Miraidon ex, as these have been confirmed to happen in Japan. Although it&#39;s unclear if these products will be the exact same as their Japanese iterations (sets, for instance, often have omitted cards for the English version), they are likely to be similar. The Japanese Starter Deck &amp; Build Sets include all that&#39;s needed to play the TCG, with a few extra officially branded items – a starter deck, playmat, VSTAR Marker, and coin.




Although nothing has officially been announced for the English releases yet, it is likely that Temporal Forces will include many of the Paradox Pokémon as well as several new ACE SPEC cards. There are still several months left to wait before the Pokémon Trading Card Game&#39;s next expansion, Temporal Forces, is released, and more information is expected to come following the Paldean Fates release at the end of January.
