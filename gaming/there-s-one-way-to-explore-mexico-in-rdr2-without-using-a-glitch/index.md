## Literature Review

A new mod has reworked locations from Red Dead Redemption&#39;s map to finally let players visit Mexico in Red Dead Redemption 2 without using glitches.




There is now finally a way to visit Mexico in Red Dead Redemption 2 without using glitches. Despite some key characters in the story having ties to the location, it was inaccessible in the 2018 title&#39;s main campaign, leaving many to wonder if Rockstar would add it in later story DLC, but unfortunately this never materialized.




Mexico was featured in the first Red Dead Redemption game as the second region John Marston travelled to in his pursuit of two of his former allies from the doomed Van der Linde Gang, Bill Williamson and Javier Escuella, during the main storyline. In this time he also assisted a rebel group led by Abraham Reyes as part of the Mexican Revolution. Unfortunately, when playing its prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, players will hit an invisible wall if they try to get into Mexico, despite the location appearing on the game&#39;s map.

                  Red Dead Redemption 2 Review: A True Achievement In Gaming   Rockstar Games&#39; Red Dead Redemption 2 is already one of the biggest video games of all-time, but does it live up to the hype?   


 Players Could Previously Access Mexico Via Glitches 
But There Wasn&#39;t Much To See
          




Despite it not being accessible officially in Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s story, some players managed to find an exploitable glitch that allowed them to access Mexico. To exploit this Mexico glitch, players must have completed the main story of Red Dead Redemption 2, which allowed them to travel to New Austin. From there, they&#39;d have to travel to the westernmost point, along the Sea of Coronado and ride their horse through the water, aiming to the right of a rock on the shoreline to find the hole in the invisible wall.

Unfortunately, once in this part of the map, there isn&#39;t much to do, and if players go too far off the map, they&#39;ll fall into a void and die. It&#39;s possible to visit locations such as El Presidio, but the models are incomplete and have lower resolution texturing, clearly only intended to be seen from a distance. Other areas from the first game, such as Casa Madrugada or Las Hermanas also simply don&#39;t exist, with players seeing a bare piece of land upon traveling there. The rocky, leveled terrain of Escalera is also present, but with none of the buildings.




Red Dead Redemption 2 has been largely praised since its launch for its impressive visuals and rich open-world, which covers a large portion of Rockstar&#39;s fictional version of the United States of America. Territories from the first Red Dead Redemption such as New Elizabeth and New Austin received a major revamp for the prequel, allowing players to explore these locations with more detail than before. Therefore, it was a shame for those fans of the series who wanted to see some of Red Dead Redemption&#39;s Mexican locations upgraded to this quality as well.

                  RDR2: Why Javier Left Mexico (&amp; Why He Shouldn&#39;t Have Returned)   There was a good reason why Red Dead Redemption&#39;s Javier Escuella fled Mexico before the events of the game, and he should have stayed gone.   



 A Nuevo Paraíso Mod Finally Brings Iconic RDR Locations To RDR2 
Mexico Team Has Reworked RDR&#39;s Mexico Map
         




As shown in a cinematic showcase video by Noru122, a new mod by Mexico Team called &#34;Nuevo Paraíso - Mexico&#34; remakes and remasters many of the Mexican locations from Red Dead Redemption, reworking the Nuevo Paraíso map from that game to transfer it into Red Dead Redemption 2. The mod is described as a &#34;collaborative community effort&#34; and Noru122 points out that they are not a part of Mexico Team, and the mod is &#34;not related to anything Rockstar Games is doing in regards to Red Dead Redemption 2&#34;.


 

Noru122&#39;s video begins by showing the aforementioned El Presidio, restored from the half-built, bare-bones version seen through the Red Dead Redemption 2 glitch to now include a more fleshed out interior with stairs leading from the ground to upper levels, as well as further buildings, items and vehicles such as wagons. Some of these textures are arguably still a lower resolution than the ones seen in Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s main map, but the video clearly states that the mod is still a work in progress.




Other locations shown include Torquemada, El Matadero, Sepulcro, Las Hermanas, Chuparosa, Tesoro Azul, Escalera and Casa Madrugada, the latter of which seems to be the most complete of them all. Whereas El Presidio&#39;s showcase focused more on the revamped location, others showed more signs of life. Members of the Mexican Army can be seen inhabiting Torquemada alongside a donkey, and several residents of Casa Madrugada can be seen talking to each other on balconies or at the train station.

                  Complete Red Dead Timeline Before RDR3 - Revolver, Redemption, &amp; RDR2   Rockstar&#39;s acclaimed Red Dead series spans several decades in the Wild West with numerous protagonists across its three main Western titles.   



 How To Access The Nuevo Paraíso Mod 
The Mod Is Currently A Work In Progress
          

While the Nuevo Paraíso mod is a work in progress, it has been uploaded to libertycity.net by Mexico Team for people to enjoy in its Early Access state. The mod has also been uploaded to the popular mod site, Nexux Mods by LeBakou and is listed as &#34;Nuevo Paraiso - Mexico mod WIP&#34;. LeBakou points out that they did not take part in making the mod, however, and are therefore unable to help with any issues players may face with it should they download it from Nexus Mods, stating that their reason for uploading it was that Mexico Team allows anyone to share it, and they&#39;d rather do it than &#34;some shady fella.&#34;




The Nuevo Paraíso mod has been available since earlier in 2023. However, Mexico Team seems to be hard at work refining it to finally bring the fan-favorite locations to life in Red Dead Redemption 2. While there is still work to be done, some of the more complete locations such as Casa Madrugada are an extremely positive indication of what the completed version of the mod could eventually look like, and it is certainly worth downloading for those playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC, especially as that platform has yet to receive an official release of Red Dead Redemption, despite the game&#39;s port to PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in 2023.
