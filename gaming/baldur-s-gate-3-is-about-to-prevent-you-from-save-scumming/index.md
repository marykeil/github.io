# Baldur s Gate 3 Is About To Prevent You From Save Scumming


## SUMMARY 



  A seemingly leaked achievement for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 suggests a new difficulty mode is coming to the game.   Larian Studios will seemingly be adding Honour mode, which originates from the developer&#39;s previous Divinity: Original Sin CRPGs.   Honour mode limits the number of save files that can be kept, and also has sever consequences for a total party kill.

## Literature Review

Save scumming has been a critical tool for many Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaigns, but a new addition to the game could shake things up in a major way.




Save scumming is a staple of many Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaigns, but it looks like developer Larian Studios is finally going to directly address the practice with an update for the game. As a general term, save scumming refers to saving games right before risky moments and reloading upon failure in order to achieve a more desirable outcome. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 makes it particularly easy to employ this strategy and build a laundry list of backup points, as saving is possible at any time besides cutscenes and never has to overwrite any previous files.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 save scumming can be used for many different types of challenges, and it becomes especially useful given the semi-random nature of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based gameplay. A party member might fail an almost guaranteed strike at a critical moment in battle, for example, and reloading can urge Lady Luck in a more favorable direction. Dice rolls extend to much more than just combat, affecting skill checks in conversation and general challenges, and saving whenever dice appear on-screen offers a homespun version of advantage on every roll.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Honour Mode Will Limit Saves In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
         




The indication of a future save scum limitation comes from a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 achievement that appeared on the PC game client GOG, an addition discovered and pointed out by Reddit user W0lferino93. This achievement, titled Foehammer, apparently requires a player to &#34;Complete the game in Honour mode,&#34; a setting which isn&#39;t currently available in the game. Honour mode has, however, appeared in Larian&#39;s Divinity: Original Sin games, and its implementation there places harsh limits on the use of saves that ultimately makes effectively save scumming difficult.

The defining aspect of Honour mode is the use of a singular save file, which frequently autosaves after major moments to keep things up to date with current events. Having a total party kill in a battle will end the save file completely, making it essentially a built-in ironman mode that punishes mistakes as severely as possible. For anyone used to having a long list of save files to fall back on, the difficulty spike of Honour mode might be significantly more punishing than going from Balanced to Tactician mode in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as failure is fundamentally no longer an option.




                  Don&#39;t Be Scared To Save Scum In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   While save scumming in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 might seem like cheating to some players, it can be an important tool for making the game more enjoyable.   



 How Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Honour Mode Will Be Different 
          

The biggest limitation to save scumming in the Divinity: Original Sin versions of Honour mode comes in the combat autosaves, which happen immediately after a party member dies in battle. This makes it impossible to turn back the clock on decisive moments, a feature that is likely to reappear in the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 implementation of the mode. It&#39;s also likely, however, that Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will feature more autosaves than ever before on Honour mode, as the game&#39;s extensive use of chance introduces more opportunities to dial up the punishment than Divinity: Original Sin ever did.






Frequent long resting is a much better alternative to conserving necessary spell slots when trying to stay alive in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 combat.




As combat autosaves are clearly employed to prevent save scumming, it makes sense that Honour mode in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will also autosave after any roll of the dice. This could have vast repercussions for anyone who even infrequently employs reloads, from closing off opportunities to dodge fights with diplomacy to wrecking romantic advancements. Using Inspiration will still offer a chance of turning back the clock in particularly dire scenarios, but the cap of four banked Inspiration at any one time can make it a precious resource when a situation turns south.

                  How To Get Inspirations In Baldur’s Gate 3   Inspirations are opportunities to reroll vital checks in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, allowing you to get a second chance to succeed when following a Background.   






 Honour Mode Makes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 More Like D&amp;D 
          

If there&#39;s any game that deserves a setting like Honour mode, it&#39;s Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as taking this approach brings it closer to its DnD roots than ever before. Tabletop games are all about choices and consequences, and there&#39;s no reloading a physical roll once the dice have hit the table. That isn&#39;t to say that there aren&#39;t situations where DMs and players can use their discretion to go back to the drawing board on something, but this kind of interventionism is usually reserved for scenarios ruined by a hostile player or extraneous circumstances.

Forcing the possibility of having to roll up a new character after failing in combat also hearkens back to early editions of DnD, which were often played with less forgiving parameters than many modern tables employ. Mashing this up against the long and involved story of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can have the potential for greater frustration, but it nevertheless offers the most decidedly old-school way to play the game. Managing resources and thinking outside the box in combat become more critical than ever, and taking risky steps on the off chance that they pay off is relegated to a last resort.




                  Baldur’s Gate 3 Combat Would Be Better Using Another D&amp;D Edition   Baldur’s Gate 3 lets players shove enemies and interact with the environment, but the 5e Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules are a bad fit for that focus.   



 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Honour Mode Is Best For Veterans 
          

At the end of the day, Honour mode isn&#39;t likely to be the best approach for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 newcomers, as learning the ropes of a complex RPG can take some time. Familiarity is the best possible ally when it comes to tackling the game&#39;s challenges, so having a good idea of how the most challenging fights will play out can make a run without save scumming or temporary game overs much more viable. Experience in other CRPGs and DnD itself can certainly help, but nothing beats having a successful campaign of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in the back pocket before cranking up the difficulty.




In most cases, simply choosing to avoid save scumming without turning on Honour mode offers a more palatable balance, as a game over screen still won&#39;t spell the end of everything. Even so, the dedication of the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 fanbase means there are plenty of players looking for something even more challenging than Tactician mode, and this potential new addition is a nail-biting way to push the game further. For anyone who has relied on save scumming to get the best outcomes in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Honour mode represents an unforgiving challenge that could change everything about the game experience.
