## SUMMARY 



  Although Diablo 4&#39;s third season has not had its name revealed, announcements at BlizzCon 2023 gave players an idea of what kind of content to expect.   D4 Season 3 will feature a new challenge called The Gauntlet, which is a new and improved version of Challenge Rifts from Diablo 3.   In The Gauntlet, players will race to finish non-linear dungeons with a fixed seed, identical monster types and locations, and no loot until the timer runs out, emphasizing combat over item collection.

## Literature Review

Diablo 4â€™s next season will include even more fun additions to the game, including a play mechanic feature that was very successful in Diablo 3.




Diablo 4 shared big announcements at the recent BlizzCon 2023 event, including some sneak peeks at what players can expect to see in the yet-unnamed Season 3 of the dungeon-crawler experience. Season 2 has already provided a plethora of quality-of-life improvements that have been highly requested since the game&#39;s initial launch in June 2023, with more said to be in the pipeline for the future. Season 2 continues to provide new entertainment as well, with more endgame content and a special holiday Midwinter Blight event before the game moves on to Season 3.




Currently, Diablo 4&#39;s second Season, the Season of Blood, is in full swing and will continue until sometime at the end of January 2024. At that time, Season 3, which some are lovingly referring to as the Season of the Orange Text due to the Diablo dev&#39;s clever way of concealing the title, will take over and players will once again be making new characters to tackle the new objectives. Although not much has been disclosed yet as to the theme and missions of the upcoming Season, a type of endgame content was revealed to be coming that has some similarities to some of those seen in Diablo 3.

                  Every Major Change In Diablo 4 Season 2 from D4 Season 1   Season 2 of Diablo 4 brings more than just the Season of Blood, there are also numerous quality-of-life improvements happening for the entire game.   


 The Gauntlet In Diablo 4 Season 3 Is Similar To Challenge Rifts From Diablo 3 
Special Endgame Challenge Dungeons
         




In Diablo 3, there is an endgame feature called Challenge Rifts. The Challenge Rifts are weekly activities where the player enters a pre-set dungeon with a provided character that is designed to be an exact class and skill set and has certain items that cannot be changed, and they try to defeat all the enemies as quickly as possible. For Season 3 of Diablo 4, this basic premise is being improved upon for a newly announced feature called The Gauntlet.


 

Unlike Challenge Rifts, The Gauntlet sounds as though players will be able to take their own character through the weekly challenges, but otherwise, it will be very similar. It will include a special weekly endgame challenge dungeon with the main goal of slaughtering all enemies inside quicker than other players have managed to. Players will compete for top places on leaderboards that are categorized for each class, as well as unique leaderboards for hardcore characters or those who attempt the challenge solo.




                  Diablo 4 Review: Classic Dark Hack &#39;n &#39;Slash Done Right   Diablo 4 is a great addition to the series with a dark and gritty tone that is expertly balanced by the satisfaction of mowing down hordes of enemies.   



 How The Gauntlet In Diablo 4 Season 3 Will Work 
Weekly Non-Linear Dungeon
          

The Gauntlet will be accessed only after a player has reached World Tier 4, but characters do not have to be level 100 to attempt the dungeon. Each dungeon in The Gauntlet is a fixed seed, non-linear dungeon. This means that the types and locations of monsters, the map and layout of the dungeon, and all affixes will remain identical throughout the week for each run for all players, and multiple runs are allowed. Within The Gauntlet there will be no loot to pick up until the timer runs out, so the focus is entirely on killing rather than grabbing items. The players with the highest scores will be shown on special leaderboards that feature the top 1,000 players and reset weekly, with the top 10 players of each week being permanently recognized in the Hall of the Ancients.




Endgame content is always in demand for games such as Diablo 4, and the addition of The Gauntlet will give players a new goal to try to shoot for each week while they perfect their skills in the special dungeon. Challenge Rifts have been a very popular format for Diablo 3, with the main complaint being that players could not use their own characters for the attempts. Now, with The Gauntlet, that has been rectified, so players can not only use their own character, but they can see how they stack up against others of the same class with the new leaderboards in Diablo 4.
