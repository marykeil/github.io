# You Might Want To Rethink Your Pokémon Team Before Playing Indigo Disk DLC


## SUMMARY 



  The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet focuses on Double Battles, rather than traditional one-on-one matches.   Double Battles require different tactics and encourage the use of synergies between Pokémon, meaning players will likely want to rethink their roster.   The Indigo Disk offers a refreshing change to the usual Pokémon experience, challenging players to learn more about their Pokémon and providing an enjoyable new challenge.

## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s new Indigo Disk DLC makes changes to the standard formula, which could mean alterations to many people’s Pokémon teams.




People may need to restructure their Pokémon team before playing Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s new Indigo Disk DLC. The Indigo Disk offers a large new map to explore, full of new Pokémon to catch and trainers to battle. However, the specific challenges it offers can also radically alter the strategic approach needed to overcome them when compared to the base game.The Indigo Disk builds heavily upon The Teal Mask in many respects, including prominent characters such as Carmine and Keiran. Similarly, much like the previous part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, the DLC introduces new Pokémon to battle with, opening up many new strategies to experiment with through the expanded Pokédex alone. However, the unique culture of Blueberry Academy places a twist on the standard Pokémon formula, which can necessitate doing more than simply collecting new species and training them alongside a regular postgame team to beat the Elite Four of the Blueberry League.




                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 The Indigo Disk DLC Focuses On Double Battles 
          

The NPC trainers encountered at Blueberry Academy use the Double Battle format, as opposed to the Single Battles predominantly seen elsewhere in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. This both encourages and necessitates new tactics on both sides, which in turn creates a refreshing new experience as people progress through the DLC. The strategies used in Pokémon can be incredibly wide-ranging, incorporating abilities, moves, and even the use of held items with supposedly negative effects to gain an advantage. Naturally, Double Battles can greatly increase the complexity of such tactics due to the additional Pokémon on the field, which in turn could see people making a change to their regular team members.




                  Pokémon Indigo Disk Has The Strongest Trainer Ever, Even Beating Cynthia   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC reveals the series’ strongest trainer ever. Here’s who it is, and what makes them so powerful.   

 The most effective strategies for Double Battles typically hinge on the use of synergy – utilizing effects that work well not just on their own, but in tandem with each other. For example, having one Pokémon use Sunny Day so that the second can then use Solar Beam without first needing to charge for a turn. It should be noted that there are several moves, such as the ally-boosting Helping Hand, which are essentially useless unless they are used in Double Battles. But to take advantage of these moves and synergies, some alterations may be needed for a team with members without the appropriate movepools or other traits.After so much time spent fighting Single Battles, The Indigo Disk’s prominent Double Battle format is a novel change that helps it stand out from the rest of Scarlet and Violet’s content. With that being said, one notable Double Battle that does occur during base Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is the Gym Battle against Ryme, which uniquely involves stat-boosting cheers for both sides. But for the most part, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet stays with the classic formula with few exceptions outside online play.






 Lacey Begins The Indigo Disk By Demonstrating Excellent Double Battle Tactics 
          

Lacey provides a perfect introduction to the potential of Double Battles during her initial battle at the start of The Indigo Disk. Here, she begins with Plusle and Minum, the two Cheering Pokémon. The pair make great use of Helping Hand in order to boost their offence, but Lacey’s strategy is evidently deeper than this one move. Her Pokémon have the hidden abilities Volt Absorb and Lightning Rod, as opposed to the more common Plus and Minus respectively. Although this change sacrifices a straight power boost (which the use of Helping Hand can replace), it allows Lacey to do things like heal her Minum with her Plusle’s indiscriminate Discharge.



Using Helping Hand gives an allied Pokémon a 50% damage boost for that turn.







 Of course, something else that needs to be taken into account with Double Battles is the strategies that the format can dissuade without workarounds. Although Lacey’s use of Discharge is to her benefit, it and other indiscriminately-damaging Moves can still be less useful for a Pokémon team less prepared to handle them. The self-destructing Explosion becomes much more daunting, for example, when two team members face fainting instead of one. However, as with most dangers in Pokémon, this can be mitigated. For example, the Explosion-user can be paired with a Ghost-type Pokémon immune to the attack, or a Pokémon that can avoid Explosion’s effects by using a move like Fly.



 Double Battles Help Make The Indigo Disk More Entertaining 
         

 This is not the first time that DLC design has encouraged a change in a player&#39;s Pokémon team, albeit The Indigo Disk&#39;s changes are for different reasons. The Teal Mask’s wild Pokémon were too weak for the average postgame team, even with a limited form of level scaling in effect, requiring the use of new captures or boxed Pokémon to create an appropriate level of difficulty. That is, of course, unless people are eager to play through the first part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero as quickly as possible after having already finished the main game, in which case the level difference could be an asset.The Double Battles used throughout The Indigo Disk are a fun change to the usual Pokémon experience, especially as they have never been this popular before among NPCs. The integration of this change to gameplay through the worldbuilding of Blueberry Academy’s own culture is very well done as well. Moreover, the new degree of strategizing that they introduce challenges people to learn more about their Pokémon and how they can synergize, which can easily lead to experimentation with new team members. And of course, the new strategic angle applies to NPCs as well, resulting in battles that make completing this Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLC an enjoyable new challenge.
