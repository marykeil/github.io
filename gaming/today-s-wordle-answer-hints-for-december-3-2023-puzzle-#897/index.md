## Literature Review

December 3rd’s Wordle answer is not going to be easy to solve unless players use relevant hints to save their daily streaks.





The best way to find repeating letters is to use Wordle’s hard mode, which does not let you reuse confirmed letters in different spots. This will prevent you from using random words and force you to use words that contain letters in the exact spots. Even then, you can still sacrifice your daily streak if you do not use relevant hints.
