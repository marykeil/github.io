## Literature Review

The Tiefling Prince Zevlor is someone you can find and rescue in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 once you reach the Mind Flayer Colony area near the end of Act 2.





In order to save Zevlor, you need to help the Tieflings during Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. This means you cannot slaughter the Tiefling group; otherwise, the quest to save Zevlor will not be available later on. Once you reach the Moonrise Towers in Act 2, the &#34;Rescue the Tieflings&#34; quest ties into the events from earlier where members of that group were captured.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 1   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is hiding boss encounters, powerful armor, weapons, cutscenes, and companions as long as the party knows where to look.

Although he will be a prisoner, Zevlor can be found in the Mind Flayer Colony. The Mind Flayer Colony is a secret location that will unlock once you fight Ketheric Thorm for the first time. Thorm will run away to this location once you have done enough damage to him. Pursuing him will lead you to the colony, where you will find Zevlor. If you choose not to rescue him, he will meet a tragic ending in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but if you want to save him, you will first need to battle many Mind Flayer enemies. 



The Mind Flayer Colony has many enemies that can force a character to make a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw, making items like the Helmet of Autonomy good to bring here.







The &#34;Find Zevlor&#34; quest will mark where the Tiefling is on your map as soon as you enter the Colony in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Toward the north section of this area, you will discover all the captured Tieflings at the end of a corridor trapped in Mind Flayer pods. Going to the right reveals a control panel that you can interact with to see what options you have regarding trapped people being turned into monsters.

You can manipulate this Control Panel near the pods, and this is where you will get the choice to either free Zevlor and all other NPCs in the room or purge everyone. When you choose to release Zevlor and others, you will have to face many Mind Flayers and several Intellect Devourers in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. 



The Mind Flayers attack with Tentacle Whip strikes and Mental Blasts, but if they can connect their Consume Brain ability, it will kill whoever they target in one hit.







Depending on which companions you have in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, this battle can be easy or quite difficult to overcome. However, since you freed Zevlor earlier, he will help you out in the battle, giving you an advantage against the Mind Flayers. Once you defeat every enemy, a conversation with Zevlor will trigger, where you may choose to let him escape from the Colony so that he may atone for the mistakes he made in Act 1.

While there are no physical rewards when you find and rescue Zevlor in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the decision to let him go will earn your approval from some companions and a future ally for the game&#39;s final mission.
