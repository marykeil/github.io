## Literature Review

RoboCop has a lot of skills to choose from, each one with its own advantages, but in RoboCop: Rogue City, some are better to get earlier than others.





In Robocop: Rogue City, there is a single skill tree with eight different basic skills that can be leveled separately. Within each skill, spending two points, six points, and ten points will unlock a new perk for that skill and give RoboCop a bit of a boost. With all that in mind, it is essential to make thoughtful decisions about which skills and perks to invest in earlier in the game.
            
 
 &#34;A Great Game &amp; Everything An Adaptation Could Wish For&#34; - RoboCop: Rogue City Review 
Robocop: Rogue City delivers an inspired and enthusiastic take on the classic franchise, even if some of its budgetary constraints are apparent. 













 








 1  Deduction Skill Tree 
Allows Enhanced Scanning
        

The first perk in Deduction is one of the best perks to get first in the game, as Enhanced Scanning allows you to detect hidden objects, increasing your XP faster. The entire tree is focused on gaining extra XP from finding collectibles and will allow you to earn more and more XP early in the game. This allows you to invest quickly in the rest of the skills on the tree and build up RoboCop into an unstoppable force.





 2  Psychology Skill Tree 
Doubles Public Trust Points


 







While combat skills and health may seem tempting, the Psychology skill is another great early-game skill to invest in sooner rather than later. Enhanced Public Trust doubles the amount of Public Trust points RoboCop receives, and it can make it a lot easier to navigate the city and for missions to end in a more favorable light. This tree can also unlock many other dialogue options that will make RoboCop have better interactions with the public and get a good ending in RoboCop: Rogue City.





 3  Vitality Skill Tree 
Increases Recovery Charges
        

You likely won’t be hurting too much for extra help early in the game, so it is not the first priority for you to invest in. However, the Fuse Boxes Recovery allows players to recover half their health at Fuse Boxes, and it also increases the amount of Recovery Charges RoboCop has. This will make RoboCop even more tanky, and every skill point in the Vitality tree will increase RoboCop’s health points.





 4  Scanning Skill Tree 
Increase Investigation Vision


 







Some of these skills are enjoyable but less necessary to grab as early as possible, and Scanning falls into that category. That being said, Scanning will make it easier to see enemies and increase the range of RoboCop’s investigation vision. The first perk, Ricochet, will also let RoboCop shoot enemies who are hiding behind cover, which might make it a lot easier to complete missions.





 5  Focus Skill Tree 
Slow Down Time &amp; Increase Critical Damage
        

Like Scanning, Focus allows you to make combat a bit easier and a little more fun. Slow Motion allows RoboCop to see everything at a reduced rate for a short time. Later perks increase your critical damage and allow the Slow Motion to last even longer if you take out enemies in that mode. While not a priority, this perk certainly is entertaining to play around with in RoboCop: Rogue City.





 6  Engineering Skill Tree 
Reprogram Turrets
        

Engineering seems somewhat interchangeable with Focus in terms of priority levels, as it gives RoboCop some fun combat options. However, in this case, the later perks are the more valuable, as they allow RoboCop to get into safes without combinations and reprogram turrets. However, it is a very costly perk to reach for at the beginning of the game, so it is best to save that for a little later when you already have some other skills.





 7  Combat Skill Tree 
Extra Damage Stats


 







​​​​​​​
It might be odd for this to be such a low priority, but early in RoboCop: Rogue City, RoboCop likely will not struggle too much. The skill tree will give RoboCop extra damage, and the perks are varied attack bonuses, but similar options can be earned from the earlier-mentioned skills like Scanning, Focus, and Engineering. However, Shockwave can stun enemies, so feel free to invest two points in it earlier if enemies are growing a bit too tough.





 8  Armor Skill Tree 
Increase Health
        

Vitality is already a way to increase RoboCop’s health, and he is already quite challenging, so this one has the lowest priority for early in the game. Investing points elsewhere will be more valuable and give you more XP earlier to invest in less important skills. That being said, the late-game perk of Deflect will be quite fun to have and let enemies destroy themselves with their own bullets. The skill will also help get better endings in RoboCop: Rogue City.
