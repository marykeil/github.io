 Building A Rocket Ship In LEGO Fortnite 
          

YouTuber JaxBek shows how to build a rocket ship in his video below, and the detailed requirements are as follows. Building a Rocket Ship will take a little time once you start, but collecting the materials is the hardest part. If you are playing Survival Mode, remember that as your Village is upgraded, villagers can collect resources for you, such as marble in LEGO Fortnite. Remember, what goes up must come down, and you must reassemble your Rocket. The table below lists all the materials you will need for the parts required to build a Rocket Ship.





 



This is a very basic ship, just enough to build the base of a Rocket Ship. The components are listed in order of how they should be assembled.




  Component   Amount Needed   Materials Required   Notes    Dynamic Foundation   1   4x Wood   Place this down first    Wood Foundation (4x4x12)   1   1x Wood   Place this in the middle of the Dynamic Foundation    Dynamic Foundation   1   4x Wood   Place this Dynamic Foundation on top of the last piece    Large Thruster   4   3x Wooden Rods 2x Blast Powder 1x Torch   Place all four along the bottom of the last placed Dynamic Foundation. They should be placed evenly, in the corners with a single brick margin around the edge.    Castle Railing 04 (1x12x3)   4   1x Granite   Place these along the top with the edges touching, it may be a little uneven but you can replace these with other walls or fences to make it look the way you want.    Activation Switch   1   1x Wood 1x Blast Powder   Place this on top or where you plan for your character to stand when you want to blast off.   






Add more walls, a roof, or even a garden to complete the ship and make it your own. Replace the fences with walls and add a roof to make it look like an enclosed rocket. Remember, outfits from Fortnite&#39;s base game often transfer over to LEGO form, giving you plenty of options to look like an astronaut! While this is a basic build that will allow you to blast off, there are plenty of ways to make your Rocket Ship truly your own in LEGO Fortnite.
