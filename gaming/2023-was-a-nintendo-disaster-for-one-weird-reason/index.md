# 2023 Was A Nintendo Disaster For One Weird Reason


## SUMMARY 



  In 2023, one character did not appear in any Nintendo games for the first time since 2000, breaking a long streak.   Despite the success of the Super Mario franchise, this character was overlooked and not included in games like Super Mario Bros. Wonder.   It is unlikely that the character will have a significant presence in Nintendo&#39;s 2024 lineup, causing disappointment among fans who hope to see him return in the future.

## Literature Review

Nintendo didnâ€™t really have a bad year in 2023 overall, but there was one particular thing missing from the year that has seemed to be overlooked.




On the surface, it would appear that Nintendo didn&#39;t have too bad of a year in 2023. Many great games were released over the months, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, yet there was one glaring omission in Nintendo&#39;s lineup of games. One that could have been easily corrected and broke a decades-long streak that the company might not have even given enough attention to for them to know what they had done.




Nintendo&#39;s mascot, Mario, was one of the nominee choices for The Game Awards 2023&#39;s Game of the Year, with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Meanwhile, the remake of Super Mario RPG was one of the hot gift items shared for the holidays. The Super Mario franchise was having a good year, yet one character has been neglected, casting a dark shadow over the year and ending a run that could easily have continued with his addition to Mario Wonder.

                  10 Best Nintendo Switch Games Of 2023   2023 was good for the Nintendo Switch with many great games released for the versatile console, including Mario &amp; Zelda alongside newcomers.   


 2023 Was The First Year Since 2000 Without Waluigi 
         

Waluigi, the arch-rival to Luigi and Wario&#39;s best friend, has appeared in games every year since his original debut in 2000 until that record was broken in 2023. Super Mario Bros. Wonder would have been the most likely opportunity for his reign to continue, yet Nabbit was somehow chosen to enter the Flower Kingdom instead.





 

Super Mario Wiki on X (formerly known as Twitter) reported the oversight, with accompanying spreadsheets documenting the games that Waluigi has shown up in over the past two decades.



 Nintendo&#39;s 2024 Lineup Doesn&#39;t Look Much Better For Waluigi 
          

It appears unlikely that the lanky Waluigi will be getting much more screen time in 2024 either, as it is doubtful he will be taking the stage in Princess Peach: Showtime! coming in March, nor will he be part of the Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake without some very creative story changes. The only possibility that can be imagined from the currently announced lineup of Nintendo&#39;s releases for 2024 would be if Waluigi could somehow make a cameo in Luigi&#39;s Mansion 2 HD, although this is also not likely as he was not part of the original game.




                  10 Most Anticipated Nintendo Switch Games Of 2024   2024 will be a busy year for the Nintendo Switch, with several titles announced for the console over the year including many familiar franchises.   

Waluigi may not be as big a star as other Super Mario Bros. characters, as 2023 has proven. The lack of attention he received was most likely caused by his simply being forgotten and not fitting the desired positions for the games. It is always sad to see a streak end, and Waluigi may not be a favorite, but he is still an iconic enough presence that it is hoped that he will come back for more Nintendo games in the future and not be gone for good.
