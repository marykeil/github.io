## Literature Review

The Sunday, November 19th Wordle finally used the word that many in the U.S. might not get. Here are the hints, and answer, to today&#39;s Wordle.





Only a week ago we had another difficult word to solve, the November 14th Wordle answer SASSY gave many players their first loss in a long while. These more difficult, or less commonly used, words can make for a fun refresh to the game, which has been going strong for years.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
November 19th #883
          

The November 19th Wordle answer is QUEUE.




A common word in parts of the world, QUEUE is most often used to explain a line of people waiting for something. For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE. This only provided a single &#39;E&#39; in the correct location. Moving forward we tried SHONE as our second guess which added nothing but more incorrect letters.

The situation was getting tougher since we just kept adding to the incorrect letter pile. For our third guess, we tried PLUME, hoping to find that other vowel, which we did alongside another chunk of incorrect consonants. Moving the letters around in our mind we thought it just might be the day, this is a word we were expecting and it was finally here. We went for it and scored our win-in-four with one of the most difficult Wordle answers ever, for Americans, QUEUE.
