## Literature Review

Adding Sims to Households in The Sims 4 can be done naturally through progression or forced using methods such as merging families or cheats.





The first way to add a Sim to a household in The Sims 4 is by merging families with the &#34;Merge Household&#34; mechanic. First, select an active household from your library and then open the gallery. Next, find the Sim you wish to add to your current family and choose &#34;Place Household.&#34; Finally, a prompt will appear asking if you want to merge the chosen Sims into a single household. Press the check to confirm, and the Sim will automatically switch their current lot with the active household. The procedure is the same for both preexisting and newly custom-made Sims.




                  Sims 4 Cheat Codes For Every Platform (Money, Skills, Friendships, &amp; Items)   The Sims 4 is packed with dozens of cheat codes. Players can use them to get Simoleons, unlock items, improve their Sims&#39; relationships, and more.   


 How To Add a Sim To Your Household In The Sims 4 
According to Gamezo, the most straightforward way to add a Sim to a household is to have two Sims fall in love. During the course of the relationship, one of the Sims will wish to move in with you. You can add another family member if you choose to have a baby with your partner, after which an AI-generated child will also be added to the household.



You can use some Relationship Cheats in The Sims 4 if you are struggling to romance an NPC of your choice or want to speed up the process.




Another way a Sim can be added to a household is by using the &#34;Asking to join a household&#34; mechanic. GGRecon suggests that if you cross a certain friendship level threshold, the option will become available in The Sims 4. This means you will have to organically grow your friendship level with NPCs so that they can trust you enough to move in with you as a friend/roommate. 




The fourth way to expand households in The Sims 4 involves cheating, so note that trophies and achievements will become unavailable through this method. To activate cheats in The Sims 4, PC players can use Ctrl &#43; Shift &#43; C to open up the Cheat Console. Console players can open this window by pressing all four triggers on their gamepad. Next, type in &#34;testingcheats true,&#34; select a Sim, and choose the &#34;Add to Family&#34; option to add them to an active household in The Sims 4.
