# Why It s Goat Simulator 3 &amp; Not Goat Simulator 2


## SUMMARY 



  Goat Simulator 3 is a sequel to the original Goat Simulator, but what happened to Goat Simulator 2?   More and more people are playing the 2022 release thanks to its recent addition to Xbox Game Pass - which means even more players are confused about its title.   The title choice fits well with the nonsensical and chaotic gameplay of Goat Simulator, as the franchise doesn&#39;t take itself seriously.

## Literature Review

When Goat Simulator 3 was announced as the sequel to 2014&#39;s Goat Simulator, many were left wondering whether a Goat Simulator 2 existed.




When Goat Simulator 3, sequel to 2014&#39;s Goat Simulator, was announced at Summer Game Fest 2022, audiences were left puzzled about whether a Goat Simulator 2 existed. The Goat Simulator series appears to have skipped over Goat Simulator 2 which is a confusing move for players both new and old.




Goat Simulator released in 2014, quickly becoming an unexpected hit and gaining a significantly larger player base than anticipated for a game in which players take on the role of a goat and wreak havoc in an open-world map. This was in part thanks to the YouTube community who created countless videos showing the weird and wonderful gameplay. Goat Simulator 3 released on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as the Epic Games Store, in November 2022. A Steam version is due to release in Q1 2024.

                  Goat Simulator 3 Trailer Shows Off Driving, Flying Goats   A hilarious announcement trailer for Goat Simulator 3, which mirrors the iconic trailer for Dead Island 2, was revealed during Summer Game Fest 2022.   


 


 Why It&#39;s Called Goat Simulator 3 
          

In a 2022 interview with Dotesports, Goat Simulator 3&#39;s creative director Santiago Ferrero confirmed why the team skipped Goat Simulator 2, and the reason is just as silly as players probably expected. &#34;Half of the team [wanted] to name it Goat Simulator 2, [but] the other half wanted Goat Simulator 4,&#34; he told the publication at the time. Opting for 3 was &#34;a compromise.&#34;




While an unusual choice, the title is perfect for a game like Goat Sim, as it perfectly encapsulates the nonsensical, whimsical, and hilariously chaotic world and its gameplay. Even the physics in Goat Simulator make no sense, so having a name that completely skips out another entry in the franchise is a clever choice from the Coffee Stain developers.



 Goat Simulator 3&#39;s Dead Island 2 Theory Explained 

 

Before developers explained the title, one of the first theories as to why the 2022 sequel is called Goat Simulator 3 is that the title is jokingly referring to the eight-year wait between the two games, playing on the fact that two games could have feasibly released during that timeframe. For the fans patiently waiting for more goat-centric gaming, a wait of nearly a decade is a considerable one, which could have been a point of concern for players. However, the series is known for its comedy and for not taking itself seriously, and making light of the long wait between games is definitely something one would expect from Goat Sim.




                  Goat Simulator 3 Should Be Your Next Big Party Game   Goat Simulator 3 will feature a 4-player multiplayer mode which is awesome because wreaking havoc on the world as a goat is better with friends.    

This theory was bolstered by Goat Simulator 3&#39;s announcement trailer at Summer Game Fest, which poked fun at the absence of updates regarding Dead Island 2 with a faithful shot-by-shot recreation of one of the zombie game&#39;s first trailers. At the time, updates on the game&#39;s development had all but stopped, leaving many fans wondering if it would ever release. The sequel to 2011&#39;s Dead Island finally ended up releasing in 2023, nine years after its announcement.



 Yes, Goat Simulator 3 Is The Sequel To Goat Simulator 
          

While it may be confusing when purchasing the latest Goat Simulator, there is definitely no Goat Simulator 2 to play or buy right now (though asking a relative for a copy could make for a fun prank at their expense). Once players have had their fun with the 2014 original, it&#39;s time to jump straight into Goat Simulator 3, which was added to Xbox Game Pass in December 2023.
