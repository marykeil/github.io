## Literature Review

The Xbox Game Pass library is expanding again in 2024, and there&#39;s a lot of variety in the titles that will be joining the subscription service.




Xbox Game Pass is going to add plenty of new games to its library in 2024, expanding the variety of choices available to anyone who subscribes to the service. Although it&#39;s impossible to say what the full scope of changes to the library will be in the coming year, a number of planned titles have already been revealed. Among these options, a select number stand out as the most exciting additions to the service.
Although it&#39;s been going strong for a number of years, Xbox Game Pass has seen some recent changes, from raised prices to the rebranding of Xbox Live Gold as Xbox Game Pass Core. Things have the potential to change even more in 2024, most notably with the possibility of a free Xbox Game Pass model supported by ads. Regardless of any possible shake-ups, however, it seems that the service will still deliver on its core promise of providing a strong selection of games for subscribers.
            
 
 10 Most Anticipated Xbox Series X/S Games Of 2024 
2023 has been a banner year for acclaimed video game releases, but 2024 has plenty in store for the Xbox Series X/S consoles, including exclusives.












 








 10  Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (A44 Games) 
Action RPG
        

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is an ambitious open-world RPG, and it could be a challenge for developer A44 Games to realize its full potential. At any rate, however, a unique fantasy setting and an unsurprising focus on flintlock firearms give it an edge that make it an especially interesting 2024 Xbox Game Pass release. God-killing gameplay could make it an interesting alternative to games like God of War, and it doesn&#39;t look overly beholden to any particular inspiration.





 9  Ark 2 (Studio Wildcard) 
Multiplayer Survival
        

Anticipation for Ark 2 has had its ups and downs, with the various problems in Ark: Survival Ascended and a number of delays serving to manage expectations of greatness. At any rate, the game should look beautiful in Unreal Engine 5, especially if it can improve on the variable frame rates found in the console release of Survival Ascended. Trying it out through Xbox Game Pass can&#39;t hurt, and it could be a major hit if everything comes together.





 8  Manor Lords (Slavic Magic) 
Strategy
        

Manor Lords is a lot of ideas rolled into one strategy game, with city-building, management, and battle tactics all playing central roles in the experience. All of that is being juggled by a solo developer going by the name of Slavic Magic, which helps explain why a PlayStation port isn&#39;t currently planned, despite the lack of an exclusivity contract. The Xbox release also won&#39;t come until after PC, but Xbox Game Pass availability has already been confirmed.





 7  Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (Rabbit And Bear Studios) 
Turn-Based RPG
        

It&#39;s been over a decade since the release of a Suikoden game, but Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes aims to take up the mantle of the classic Japanese RPG series. Helmed by the original creator of Suikoden, Eiyuden Chronicle boasts the same unique appeal of a rich tapestry of characters that can be recruited to form the perfect party. If it&#39;s anything like most Suikoden games, it should be an easy way to get plenty of playtime out of Xbox Game Pass in 2024.





 6  Cities: Skylines 2 (Colossal Order) 
City-Builder
        

Cities: Skylines 2 had a rough launch on PC, with plenty of great elements being obscured by major bugs and optimization issues. Hopefully, the delayed console release in 2024 will patch over enough of these issues to be worth a download, and Xbox Game Pass offers a good way to check out the situation. If Cities: Skylines 2&#39;s console release is polished, it could eventually attain the more widely beloved status that its predecessor still enjoys.
            
 
 &#34;An Enjoyably Intricate City Planning Game&#34; - Cities: Skylines 2 Review 
While Cities: Skylines 2 doesnâ€™t have the decade of DLC yet, it is a stunning city management game that is exactly what it should be right now.








 5  Persona 3 Reload (P-Studio) 
Turn-Based RPG
        

Like many Japanese RPGs, Persona spent a lot of its history on PlayStation consoles, but Persona 3 Reload follows the more recent trend of a multi-platform release. It freshens up a beloved entry in the franchise with some more recent quality-of-life improvements and a graphical overhaul that maintains the original style. Unfortunately, Reload doesn&#39;t contain any added content from the earlier re-releases Persona 3 FES and Portable, but it&#39;s still a game that any RPG fans with Xbox Game Pass should definitely check out.





 4  Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2 (Ninja Theory) 
Action-Adventure


 







Hellblade: Senua&#39;s Sacrifice was a big hit for developer Ninja Theory, and Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2 continues the story in an adventure through Iceland in the age of the Vikings. Although the original game was self-published, Xbox Game Studios acquired Ninja Theory in 2018 and is publishing Senua&#39;s Saga as an Xbox Series X/S console exclusive. Like Senua&#39;s Sacrifice, the new entry deals with mental illness and other issues through a unique and interesting lens.





 3  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (Asobo Studio) 
Flight Simulator
        

Microsoft Flight Simulator is a series with an extraordinary legacy behind it, starting with the 1982 original that predates Microsoft software like Windows. Like the most recent entry, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is being developed by Asobo Studio, the company behind A Plague Tale: Innocence and Requiem. It comes as no surprise that a game with Microsoft in its name is an Xbox console exclusive, and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 follows up the 2020 iteration of the game in joining Xbox Game Pass.





 2  Avowed (Obsidian Entertainment) 
RPG


 







Avowed is the next game from acclaimed developer Obsidian Entertainment, taking a first-person perspective to the fantasy world of Eora established in Pillars of Eternity. If the game lives up to its potential, it could be a great experience for fans of games like The Elder Scrolls, The Outer Worlds, and Fallout. As an Xbox console exclusive, it&#39;s likely to be a major draw for Xbox Game Pass in 2024.





 1  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl (GSC Game World) 
Survival Horror FPS


 







STALKER 2 has suffered a number of delays during a difficult development cycle, but it seems locked for an early 2024 release window at this point. There&#39;s plenty of anticipation surrounding the title, as it marks the long-awaited return of a fascinating survival horror FPS series. It&#39;s also set to be an Xbox Series X/S console exclusive, so its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass is merely the cherry on top for Xbox users who are fans of the franchise.
