## Literature Review

Every Diamond &amp; Pearl starter from the Sinnoh Region returns in the Indigo Disk DLC as Pokémon you can find by boosting the diversity of map areas.





The Diamond &amp; Pearl starters are exclusive Pokémon to Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s The Indigo Disk DLC, so you have to purchase the expansion to have access to these iconic creatures. The steps to unlocking each Pokémon are tied to the League Club, the group you earn Battle Points (BP) from by finishing quests. The Terarium Club&#39;s missions in particular are important for making the starters available.






You have to beat the main story of the game and the first part of the DLC to access The Indigo Disk and every starter Pokémon from previous Generations.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 3 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   Starter Pokémon have arrived with the Indigo Disk DLC, including the Treeko, Torchic, and Mudkip from the Gen 3 Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald games.   


 How to Find and Catch Piplup 
          

The only way to find and catch the Water-type Piplup in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is to spend 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Polar Biome. Opening up the list of quests seen on the Support Board terminal in the Terarium lets you place BP on a variety of research interests of various Clubs. The donation made to fine-tuning quadrants of The Indigo Disk map causes certain starters to spawn in the world.






Other Pokémon besides starters will also begin to show up in the section of the map you invested BP in. Feel free to check your map and explore to see what creatures have begun to spawn.






 How to Find and Catch Chimchar 
          

Ironically, Chimchar appears in the Polar Biome as well when you pay 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Polar Biome. Unlike the Gen 2 starters in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, both Gen 4 Pokémon have a chance to wander the wild sections of the same area. You may want to look around in places with bodies of water for Piplup, and search higher in the mountains for the Fire-type Chimchar.



 How to Find and Catch Turtwig 
          




The Grass-type Turtwig can be found and caught when you invest 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Canyon Biome. The adorable little turtle Pokémon has powerful evolutions that you may want to use to defeat the tough new trainers found in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s DLC.

It only costs 6,000 BP to find and catch every Gen 4 starter in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, which makes the Pokémon from the Sinnoh region one of the cheapest to unlock.
