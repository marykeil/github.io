## Literature Review

2023 has been chock-full of interesting major video game releases, and it looks like 2024 won&#39;t be taking a foot off the gas anytime soon.




2023 has made it easier than ever to amass a huge backlog of video games to get through, but it doesn&#39;t look like 2024 is likely to provide any critical relief. Games like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League represent an aggressive start to the year, and diving a little deeper reveals that they&#39;re only the tip of the iceberg. Regardless of genre or style preference, the wide-ranging nature of games slated to carry the industry torch into next year offers something for every taste, and that&#39;s discounting the inevitability of surprise hits thrown into the mix.




The upcoming release slate stands out in particular when contrasted against the typical lull in exciting releases around the beginning of a calendar year. Major games coming out around the turn of a year often try to hit a November or December window to get a boost from holiday sales, resulting in a comparatively dry zone in the aftermath. The first few months of 2024 may actually be more exciting than the end of 2023, shaking up the balance in an unusual but exciting way.

                  The Game Awards 2023: Every Category &amp; Nomination   The Game Awards is one of the biggest annual events for the video game industry, and the nominees for all 31 categories have been announced.   


 RPGs Like FF7 Rebirth Get A Running Start In 2024 
Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth &amp; Persona 3 Reload Are 2024 Highlights
         

RPGs aren&#39;t always for everyone, but anyone who does enjoy them should be eating well in the first couple of months of 2024. January&#39;s Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is set to be another exciting entry in a franchise that just keeps giving, with new content like an Animal Crossing-esque side mode likely to draw in even more new fans. Although the beat-em-up gameplay of older Like a Dragon/Yakuza titles made categorizing them as RPGs feel a bit weird, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is continuing down the new tack of classic turn-based gameplay with some fun and flavorful twists.




                  How New Like A Dragon Games &amp; Yakuza Are Connected   Like a Dragon may have changed its name, but the series still has a lot of the same spirit and style that made the past Yakuza games so beloved.   

February ramps things up with several more exciting RPGs, including Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the kind of headliner that doesn&#39;t come around too often. Final Fantasy 7 Remake managed to add a new twist to a beloved game without losing the core of what made it special, and Rebirth continues the adventures of Cloud and company beyond Midgar. It also resurrects the classic multi-disc RPG tradition, which promises an expansive adventure to steal plenty of time that could otherwise be dedicated to a gaming backlog.

Persona 3 Reload is another return of a classic RPG in February 2024, adding a fresh coat of paint to the game that truly broke the Persona series out in the West. Granblue Fantasy: Relink offers something newer, placing the characters and world of a mobile game in a proper console RPG with stylish action combat. Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an action RPG that focuses on choices, following up on developer Don&#39;t Nod&#39;s prior games like Life is Strange and Vampyr. Playing any one of these titles could easily occupy multiple months in 2024, and deciding to embark on more than one roleplaying journey might snowball quickly.




                  Persona 3 Reload &amp; Persona 5 Tactica Hands-On Preview: Fresh Faces &amp; Fights   Screen Rant went hands-on with Persona 3 Reload and Persona 5 Tactica to learn more about the games&#39; mechanics, quality of life changes, and more.   



 Early 2024 Has A Game For Everyone 
Alone In The Dark &amp; Tekken 8 Are Just The Start
         

Although the RPG slate is arguably the most impressive, the overall slate for early 2024 is fairly genre-diverse. Alone in the Dark makes for a spooky start to the year on January 16, resurrecting a classic survival horror property under the new guidance of developer Pieces Interactive and publisher THQ Nordic. Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster, Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, and Tomb Raider Remastered all represent more straightforward attempts at bringing back memorable experiences, translating gameplay directly while polishing up the visuals.




2D action is another big highlight among 2024&#39;s first slate of video games, arriving in several very different forms. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sees the series return to 2D roots with a bigger focus on combat while maintaining its iconic parkour and puzzle-solving. Mario vs. Donkey Kong is all about puzzle-platforming, setting up complex levels that require planning and action to properly unlock. Mario&#39;s love interest Peach gets her own center stage in Princess Peach: Showtime!, which also lets her have a host of unique outfits and, perhaps most importantly, a sword.

                  Princess Peach Is Finally Getting What She Deserves   Princess Peach will get her very own Nintendo Switch game next year to explore a classic 3D Mario world in a color-changing dress.   

For fighting game enthusiasts, there&#39;s Tekken 8, which follows 2023&#39;s Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1 in the recent procession of major fighting game installments. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is arriving in February and looks likely to flirt with plenty of different genre elements, although it&#39;s an action-adventure title at its core. Developer Rocksteady&#39;s history with the Batman: Arkham series puts a lot of inherent momentum behind this title, so if it can rise above some uninspiring trailers and live-service concerns to meet that standard, it could take a big chunk out of a lot of people&#39;s gaming time.






 From Ark 2 To Star Wars: Outlaws, 2024 Is Crowded 
The 2024 New Release Schedule Should Be Packed Throughout
          

Most 2024 games don&#39;t yet have specific release dates, but the year is already looking to be notably busy throughout. It should be a big year for sequels, with Ark 2, Frostpunk 2, Killing Floor 3, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2, and The Wolf Among Us 2 representing only some of the titles with a number appended. Star Wars: Outlaws and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem also cash in on some major IPs with new game experiences. New properties that could be big hits are also on the table, from Obsidian&#39;s Avowed to Ubisoft&#39;s long-delayed Skull &amp; Bones (should it ever release).

                  Creating The &#34;Scoundrel Outlaw Fantasy&#34; - Star Wars Outlaws Dev Interview   Screen Rant interviews Star Wars Outlaws&#39; narrative director Navid Khavari and creative director Julian Gerighty on characters, world, and more.   




The upcoming cavalcade of games can seem as intimidating as it is exciting, especially for anyone still immersed in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, Starfield, or Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. It&#39;s certainly good to see that things are moving full steam ahead, however, even if the industry has recently been plagued by layoffs and controversies. 2023 is wrapping up an excellent run of releases with a competitive race for Game of the Year awards, and a look at games like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and more in 2024 makes it seem like another busy year is ahead.
