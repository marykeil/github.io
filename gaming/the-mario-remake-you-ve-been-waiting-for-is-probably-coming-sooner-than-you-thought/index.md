# The Mario Remake You ve Been Waiting For Is Probably Coming Sooner Than You Thought


## SUMMARY 



  The remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been rated by the ESRB.   Although there hasn&#39;t been a definitive release date announced yet, Nintendo games typically get rated by the ESRB only months before they launch.   As a remake of a classic Mario RPG, Paper Mario: TTYD may be one of the Switch&#39;s last major releases before Nintendo&#39;s new console is released.

## Literature Review

Although the exact release date of the Paper Mario: TTYD remake has yet to be announced, one piece of evidence suggests it&#39;s releasing early in 2024.




While the official release date for the remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door hasn&#39;t been confirmed outside a 2024 launch window, certain evidence suggests that the game&#39;s release date will be sooner rather than later. Widely regarded as one of the best games in its own series, and the last game to follow the formula and mechanics of the original Paper Mario, The Thousand-Year Door has consistently been among the most widely-requested Nintendo classics to be ported to the Switch.




Fortunately, even after the release of the somewhat divisive Paper Mario: The Origami King, the newest entry in the series, Nintendo has announced that a remake of TTYD is on the way, revealing a trailer for the game showing off enhanced visuals and familiar characters in a Nintendo Direct on September 14, 2023. Less fortunately, however, the game only received a vague release window of 2024, leading some to believe that the game wouldn&#39;t see launch until late in the year. While the specific release date of the TTYD remake still has yet to be officially announced or confirmed by Nintendo, one piece of evidence may point to an earlier-than-expected release date for the game.

                  Every Mario RPG, Ranked Worst To Best   The first Mario RPG was released over 25 years ago, and now that it’s being remade, it’s time to look back at which Mario RPG is the best.   


 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake Could Release In Early 2024 
          




As noted by Stealth40k on X (formerly Twitter; via Game Rant), the remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been rated by the ESRB as of December 29, 2023. While this, on its own, is inconclusive, it&#39;s worth noting that Nintendo games tend to receive their ratings relatively close to their release windows, with first-party titles like Tears of the Kingdom and other Switch-exclusives like Bayonetta 3 getting their ESRB ratings only a few months ahead of their release dates. With this in mind, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see an official TTYD release date announced at an early Nintendo Direct in 2024, or for that release date to fall within the first half of the year.



 Paper Mario: TTYD May Be One Of The Last Big Games On The Switch 
          

With the Switch&#39;s lifespan as Nintendo&#39;s main console potentially drawing near its end, the TTYD remake could end up being one of its last major releases - and since the game hasn&#39;t seen an official re-release outside its original launch on the GameCube in 2004, the remake could also let an entire new generation of fans experience one of Nintendo&#39;s most well-regarded classics. However, although the potential early release date is an exciting prospect, and the TTYD remake could influence the next Paper Mario, release date speculations should still be taken with a grain of salt until any official announcements are made.




                  Paper Mario: The Origami King Review - New Dimensions Of Fun   Paper Mario: The Origami King retains all the charm and surprising wit present in past games while introducing rewarding puzzle mechanics.   

From its reveal in late 2023, the remake of The Thousand-Year Door has quickly become one of the Switch&#39;s most highly-anticipated upcoming 2024 releases, with many fans of the franchise looking forward to a return to the series&#39; classic mechanics. Following trends set by other Nintendo games and Switch exclusives, an ESRB rating for the game may indicate that its release date will fall within the earlier parts of the year - making it likely that an official announcement for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door will be a part of an early 2024 Nintendo Direct.
