## Literature Review

One headset feature for the Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 is the ability to play different Steam games through virtual reality, but only with the right system.





The Meta Quest 2 requires you to have a PC or laptop that you might already use to run Steam games from your library. This system needs Windows 10 or 11 and a Core i5 or higher CPU in its build. Other required specs include a GTX 1070 or higher GPU and at least 8GB of RAM or more within your PC or laptop to connect to your virtual reality device.






You may be able to update certain drivers on your PC or laptop to adjust your settings to support a Meta Quest 2 or 3 connection.

 How To Set Up Steam Games For Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 
          

The steps for setting up Steam games on the Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 are to download the Oculus desktop application and connect your systems with a link cable or use an air link to pair them wirelessly. Connecting the Meta Quest 2 to a PC is best done through the wired method, but the Meta Quest 3 is better supported by wireless options due to new updates to the system in its later version.




The first thing to do is to install the app tied to the virtual reality hardware onto whatever PC or laptop you usually run your Steam games through. You will need a USB Type C cable for the wired method to connect with your Quest headset. Here are the steps for playing Steam games through a wired link:

  Turn on your Quest device.   From the Quest app, select the &#34;Devices&#34; tab in the left margin.   Choose &#34;Add Headset&#34; from the prompts that show up, then choose &#34;Quest&#34; from the next set of options.   Pick the &#34;Link (cable)&#34; option and press continue.   Turn on the Steam app on your laptop or PC.   Press &#34;SteamVR&#34; to connect to your library, then enjoy playing your Steam games.  

                  10 Essential Meta Quest 2 Games You&#39;ll Want To Download &amp; Play First   Over 500 games are available for the Meta Quest 2, which can be a daunting thought, but here are 10 of the best ones to add to a VR game library.   

The second method is more complicated since your PC or laptop must be connected to the same Wifi network as your virtual reality device. The steps for setting up a connection to Steam wirelessly are:




  Go to the Settings of the Quest app on your PC or laptop.   Press the &#34;Beta&#34; tab.   Turn the toggle on for &#34;Air Link.&#34;   Go to the main menu of your Meta Quest 2 or 3 by pressing the home button on your right controller.   Select the &#34;Oculus Link&#34; button.   Locate your PC in the link settings, then press &#34;Launch.&#34;   Return to the main menu.   Choose your Desktop, then locate and launch Steam to connect to your games.  

Following any of these steps correctly will allow you to experience virtual reality on the Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 through the Steam games you already love playing within your library.
