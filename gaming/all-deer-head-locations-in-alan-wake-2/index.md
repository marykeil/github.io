## Literature Review

Around all the three maps you can explore in Alan Wake 2, there are twelve Deer Heads mounted in different locations that hide a trove of rewards.





Unlike collectibles like Nursery Rhymes and Cult Stashes in Alan Wake 2, there are no puzzles you need to solve to earn the rewards tied to Deer Heads. Unfortunately, since these trophies don&#39;t count as items to pick up, they do not appear on your map when you reveal different markers from Ranger or Witchfinder Stations. Every elk body part is thankfully inside a building or structure to explore instead of deep within the woods.




                  Alan Wake 2: How To Solve All Nursery Rhymes &amp; Dolls Puzzles   One of the many collectibles in Alan Wake 2 are Nursery Rhymes, which are solved by placing nearby Dolls on chalk drawings made into various puzzles.   


 Every Deer Head Location in Cauldron Lake 
          

Only three Deer Heads are in Cauldron Lake, the first major area you explore in Alan Wake 2 when you begin to investigate the murders in the region. You may stumble across one accidentally while entering one of the many cabins dotting the forest here without knowing it&#39;s part of a set. These trophies bear a striking resemblance to the masks worn by Cult enemies seen throughout the game, offering some sort of connection.



Some Deer Heads may only be found after you have made progress through the story and collected items that can unlock new areas, like the Bolt Cutters or Screwdriver in Alan Wake 2.







 Deer Head  Where to Find  Map Image   Deer Head #1  Go south of the Murder Site, where you can find the Deer Head in a log cabin directly below the General Store.                         Deer Head #2  Inside the Witchfinder&#39;s Station at the northwest corner of the Cauldron Lake map.                         Deer Head #3  In the later chapters of Alan Wake 2, after you obtain the Bolt Cutters, find a way into the smaller building to the left when you enter the Rental Cabins from the locked gate to find the Deer Head.                         





 Every Deer Head Location in Bright Falls 
          

Five Deer Heads occupy the buildings of Bright Falls, which makes sense when you consider that this map includes the main town of the region and not just a few outdoor cabins. Be careful not to cross the point of no return in Alan Wake 2&#39;s story, otherwise, you will be unable to go back and search for any remaining trophies in any area. Reaching any ending in the game locks you out of the content you haven&#39;t pursued already.

 Deer Head  Where to Find  Map Image   Deer Head #4  Within Elderwood Palace Lodge, right in the room both Saga and Casey use.                         Deer Head #5  Behind the storeroom of the Oh Deer Diner, you will see the Deer Head toward the back of the shop close to the cash register.                         Deer Head #6  Go to the Manor within the Valhalla Nursing Home area, then travel to the second floor storage room to find the Deer Head.                         Deer Head #7  Inside the room without a doorknob in the Valhalla Wellness Center, in a Workshop area you can only reach during Alan Wake 2&#39;s fifth story chapter, &#34;Return 5: Old Gods.&#34;                         Deer Head #8  At the Bright Falls Ranger Station, a structure you may only reach once you have picked up the Bolt Cutters later in the game.                         





 Every Deer Head Location in Watery 
          

Only four Deer Heads remain in Watery, the last large region to explore for its variety of landmarks and other hidden treasures. Unlike the organized buildings found in Bright Falls, Watery&#39;s structures are spaced out across a wider area, making it a bit harder to find each hunting trophy. Make sure to be on the hunt for other items like Alex Casey lunchboxes in Alan Wake 2 as you try to uncover every secret this place has to offer.




 Deer Head  Where to Find  Map Image   Deer Head #9  Find Suomi Hall, then you&#39;ll see the Deer Head in the building&#39;s safe room.                         Deer Head #10  Using the Screwdriver, access the trailer at the Lighthouse Trailer Park, which is northeast from the &#34;My Trailer&#34; mark on your map.                         Deer Head #11  Travel through the locked gates next to the Kalevala Knights Workshop using the Bolt Cutters to find the Deer Head just inside the main shop area.                         Deer Head #12  Go to the Ranger Cabin that sits to the northwest of Latte Lagoon in Coffee World to find the Deer Head almost immediately inside.                         





 The Final Deer Head &amp; Rewards 
          

Once you have found all 12 Deer Heads on each map, you must talk to the head in Saga&#39;s mindspace in Alan Wake 2. Doing this gives you a hint, with the head in Saga&#39;s mind telling you to find its twin in the real world. This references the room Saga and Casey share at Elderwood Palace Lodge, a space that looks almost identical to Saga&#39;s mental hub, and a place you may remember to host one of the Deer Heads from Bright Falls.




Return to the Lodge and interact with the Deer Head in Saga&#39;s room to reveal a real deer that has shown up in the building. The animal watches you before calmly walking further down the Lodge&#39;s hallways, almost beckoning you to follow the creature. The deer will disappear from your sight as it travels down the row of guest rooms, leaving one door open at the end of the hallway to your right in Alan Wake 2.

You won&#39;t see the deer again, but you will come across an unlocked room full of healing items and ammunition for your weapons. There are a ton of more items here that will undoubtedly help you as you continue to combat the forces of shadow that have a hold over this small town. Finding all the Deer Head locations in Alan Wake 2 is a great way to stock up before the final, tough fights of the story.
