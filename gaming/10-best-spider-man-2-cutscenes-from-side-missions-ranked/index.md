## Literature Review

Insomniac&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has some amazing side missions and activities, a few of which feature some of the best cutscenes in the game.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 features a great deal of side content for Peter and Miles to explore while traversing through the streets of New York City. Though this exceptional game has a phenomenal main story, some of the game&#39;s side missions and activities are so good that they almost steal the show. One notable highlight in many of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s side missions and activities is their brilliant cutscenes, which can offer incredible cinematics, ambiance, and an invaluable addition to the game&#39;s narrative.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.]
Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has been cited as one of the best PS5 exclusive games yet to be released. While the main story is more than deserving of this accolade alone, the side content brings the game&#39;s enormous map to life. Hidden in these inauspicious non-essential activities lies some of the most deeply moving and exciting cutscenes that can be found anywhere in Insomniac&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.




























 








 10  Sandman&#39;s Daughter Gets Something To Remember Him 
Mission: &#34;Marko&#39;s Memories&#34;
        

Following the conclusion of the battle against the Sandman, the two Spider-Men will be able to start collecting 14 Marko’s Memories. Completing this results in getting a statue of Marko hugging his daughter, Keemia. Through listening to the memories, it&#39;s apparent that Marko is really just wanting to protect Keemia. At the end, Spider-Man will drop the statue off at Keemia&#39;s house, giving Sandman&#39;s daughter something nice to remember him by that shows his love for her.





 9  Miles Has A Music Lesson 
Mission: &#34;Bebop&#34;
        

Roughly halfway through the &#34;Cultural Museum&#34; storyline, Miles will be afforded an impassioned music history lesson from a saxophonist named Eugene during the side mission &#34;Bebop.&#34; After saving him from a gang of criminals attempting to steal Charlie Parker&#39;s legendary saxophone, Eugene goes on, in a cutscene, to deliver a memorable lesson in jazz history. While Miles claims to know little about jazz music, Eugene is quick to passionately note the myriad parallels between modern music and music from the past. While the priceless saxophone is unharmed and now on its way back to the museum, Eugene is a little bruised; however, Miles arrives just in time to prevent a catastrophe.





 8  Nikola Gets New Art 
Mission: &#34;FNSM App: Graffiti Trouble&#34;
        

Miles Morales&#39; love interest, Hailey Cooper, is the playable character in an FNSM app side mission with an outstanding cutscene. Taking place at the start of the mission, the florist, Nikola, shows Miles that a Good Samaritan, later revealed to be Hailey, covered up an unsightly piece of graffiti with a beautiful work of street art. The sheer joy expressed by Nikola, and the beauty of the art makes this one of the most memorable side mission cutscenes in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.





 7  Miles Confront Uncle Aaron 
Mission: &#34;Room for the Future&#34;


 







&#34;Room for the Future&#34; is the ultimate payoff for Miles unlocking every Prowler stash in New York. It is also the final step in Miles&#39; mission to help his Uncle Aaron put his days of crime to rest. Though Miles finds what appears to be a set of apartment blueprints suggesting Aaron is planning to steal from his own family, the final cutscene is incredibly wholesome and shows that this rogue has been rehabilitated through the concerted efforts of his nephew Miles and his sister-in-law, Rio Morales.





 6  Chameleon Makes A Cameo 
Mission: &#34;Unidentified Targets: Target Identified&#34;
        

Perhaps the best part of the &#34;Unidentified Targets&#34; side missions is the cameo appearance of Spider-Man&#39;s oldest enemy, Chameleon. Located in a penthouse, Spider-Man will hear a series of automated recordings intended for Kraven, Chameleon&#39;s half-brother. However, the coolest part comes in a cutscene after Spider-Man vacates the premises. Chameleon is sitting in a building across the street with a set of binoculars watching the unfolding events. The cutscene concludes with Chameleon raising a glass and proclaiming that he will achieve what his brother cannot - though ambiguous, he could mean defeating Spider-Man.





 5  Uncovering The Mystery Behind Mysterio 
Mission: &#34;Grand Finale&#34;
        

A cutscene at the end of the Mysterio series of side missions shows Spider-Man with the man behind the chaos, Quentin Beck. After confronting the staffers running the simulation, Beck is found cowering on the ground in what appears to be a server room. After the police arrest his staff and escort them away from the facility, Spider-Man and Beck have a discussion about what it means to be a villain and a hero. Before vanishing, Quentin profoundly claims that Mysterio will always be a villain, but Spider-Man will always be a hero. It shows that even though Beck helped, doing a heroic deed, he will always be perceived as a villain so Spider-Man needs to take all the credit.





 4  A Deal With Delilah 
Mission: &#34;Spider Bots&#34;


 







After completing the Spider-Bot side mission questline in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man will meet a deeply mysterious figure, Delilah. In this cutscene, Spider-Man goes to an inauspicious and seemingly abandoned street where, on a brick wall, a bright pink portal to another dimension opens. Inside is Delilah, standing in a bar, behind the counter. Delilah&#39;s inclusion is a wonderful Easter egg to the enigmatic character who was cut from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Perhaps the best part of her cameo appearance is her art style. Unlike the realistic style of the game, Delilah is rendered in the endearingly unique cartoon style that dominates Across the Spider-Verse.
























 3  Cletus Kasady Is Revealed To Be The Leader Of The Flame 
Mission: &#34;It Was Meant For Me&#34;


 







At the end of &#34;It Was Meant For Me,&#34; the final side mission in The Flame storyline, Spider-Man assists Yuri, now known by her vigilante name, Wraith, in defeating the cult&#39;s leader. In a cutscene, it is revealed that the leader of the group is the infamous killer, Cletus Kasady - more widely known as the host of Carnage. In the cutscene, Spider-Man finds himself trapped beneath a derailed train, as Kasady dowses him in fuel. Though Spider-Man survives, Kasady escapes with one of Oscorp&#39;s Symbiotes. As Carnage is often presented as the counterpoint to Venom, the return of Kasady is a must in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC.





 2  Sitting At The Dock With Howard 
Mission: &#34;FNSM App: Howard&#34;
        

In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac brought back Howard only to immediately kill him in a devastatingly sad cutscene; however, the side mission&#39;s first cutscene is arguably even more emotive than its last. In the &#34;FNSM App: Howard&#34; side mission, Spider-Man will find Howard sitting by a dock in the Financial District. Fans of the series will recognize Howard as a friendly old man who looks after a flock of pigeons, but in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, he tasks Spider-Man with freeing his birds. The cutscene is devastatingly sad as Howard recounts his unfortunate life, the death of his wife, and says a last goodbye to his feathery companions.





 1  Siting In The Park With Grandpa Earl 
Mission: &#34;FNSM App: Find Grandpa&#34;
        

One of the most heartbreaking moments in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 comes in arguably the best cutscene in any side mission. &#34;Find Grandpa&#34; is one of the most memorable FNSM app activities, primarily as a result of the mission&#39;s final cutscene. Taking place by a lake in Prospect Park, Spider-Man sits with Grandpa Earl and listens to the man recounting happier times with his wife. Earl goes on to, in a real tear-jerker, talk about his own mortality and the pains of growing old. The cutscene ends with his granddaughter, Tasha, finding the pair and sitting with her grandpa as Spider-Man leaves them to reminisce.
