## Literature Review

Although Starfield has countless ship parts, they were not all created equal. Some will barely get the job done, but others are simply overpowered.




A core component of Bethesda&#39;s space-faring RPG, Starfield, is the ability to create unique and powerful spacecraft. These custom ships are constructed of various parts that can be purchased, found, or gifted as a reward for completing missions. Though countless customization options are available to allow players to get creative in their ship designs, some parts are significantly better, rarer, and more expensive than others. Divided into three classes, the ultimate ship parts all come from the top tier of ship-building components, the C class.
Starfieldfeatures an enormous map that is primarily traversed from behind the controls of the player&#39;s unique spacecraft as they go off to explore the galaxy. Ships in Starfield are not only limited to being a means for navigation, however, as they are also a core component of combat; consequently, ships must not only be fast, agile, and able to carry cargo, but they must be well-defended and equipped with a powerful arsenal of cannons, turrets, and ballistic missile launchers.

 10  Obliterator 250MeV Alpha Turret (35,100 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 60
        

Having a turret equipped on a ship in Starfield allows for easier combat situations, as the turret will automatically fire at something within range, without players having to think about it. The Obliterator 250MeV Alpha Turret is the best turret in the game despite it being slow to fire. With a fire rate of 1.5, the Obliterator 250MeV has the highest hull and shield damage rating of any ship part - both of which are 86.
The ship weapon is purchasable from several vendors for 35,100 Credits, and it requires the Spacefarer to have unlocked the Starship Design skill at rank 4 before it can be used - the Obliterator 250MeV Alpha Turret has a ship part unlock level of 60; consequently, it is sadly one of the final ship parts to be available to the player.





 9  Poseidon DT220 Engine (25,700 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 48


 







While it&#39;s likely the second-best engine module in Starfield, it is worthy of consideration, particularly for the price, as the Poseidon DT220 Engine has a list of impressive stats. 28,320 engine thrust, 9,600 maneuvering thrust, and an engine health of 135 are among the highlights of this exceptional engine. The Poseidon DT220 Engine can be purchased from several vendors across the universe for around 25,700 Credits. Obtaining this speedy high-end engine requires that the Spacefarer be at least level 48 with a rank 3 Starship Design skill.

 8  Assurance SG-1800 Shield Generator (47,400 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 27
        

It&#39;s pretty common knowledge that space travel requires shields. Even if there isn&#39;t a constant threat of attack from enemy ships, shields are always a crucial ship component. With a shield health stat of 1,600 and shield regen of 5%, the best Shield Generator in Starfield, the Assurance SG-1800 Shield Generator, is a particularly expensive purchase; however, it is certainly worth the investment. Fetching a fee of 47,400, the Assurance SG-1800 can be purchased from a number of vendors after the player reaches level 27. Furthermore, the module requires a Starship Design skill at rank 4.





 7  10ST Hauler Shielded Cargo Hold (17,860 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 32


 







Increasing a ship&#39;s storage capacity is a key consideration when building a ship, particularly in a game such as Starfield, where players may be tempted to loot everything they see and need the room to carry it all. Although the Galleon S204 Cargo Hold has a significantly higher cargo stat, the 10ST Hauler Shielded Cargo Hold is the best cargo hold option for those intergalactic explorers who plunder and steal.
Though lower than the Galleon S204&#39;s 720 stat, the shielded nature of the 10ST Hauler ensures that long-range cargo scans are less likely to detect illegal contraband and stolen goods - perhaps making up for the storage deficit. The 10ST Hauler Shielded Cargo Hold can be purchased from The Key in the Kryx star system. 
            
 
 Should You Carry Contraband On Your Ship In Starfield? 
Carrying contraband can seem like a major risk in Starfield, but the prospects of significant financial reward have an undeniable allure.








 6  Pinch 8Z Reactor (85,200 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 60
        

The ultimate reactor module in Starfield, the Pinch 8Z Reactor is undoubtedly one of the most valuable yet invaluable components a ship could ever have. Valued at 85,200 Credits, with the prerequisites of the player reaching level 60, as well as having the Piloting and Starship Design skills both at rank 4, the Pinch 8Z is not an easy module to obtain or use. For those who are able to meet these strict requirements, the reactor can be purchased from a number of vendors across the universe.





 5  Vanguard Hellfire Autocannon (2,750 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 1
        

Perhaps the easiest to acquire, and yet one of the most beneficial early-game weapons, is the Vanguard Hellfire Autocannon. This ship weapon can be bought in Starfield after progressing along the UC Vanguard quest line, completing the quest &#34;Grunt Work&#34; and needs a piloting tech skill at rank 3. This autocannon is one of the best early guns as it can do 18 hull damage and 5 shield damage and has a rapid 7.50 fire rate. All this in a Class B weapon with a base value of 2,750 Credits is a wonderful thing to grab early in the game to protect the Spacefarer and their crew. 





 4  J-52 Gamma Grav Drive (118,200 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 54
        

Purchasing a grav drive isn&#39;t as fun as buying weapons or engines or nearly anything else on the ship, yet it is also one of the most important things to have. With a grav jump thrust stat of 50 and grav drive health of 308, the J-52 Gamma is, by quite a large margin, the best grav drive module in Starfield. Although it is an extremely expensive purchase, at 118,200 Credits, having a top-of-the-line grav drive allows players to quickly jump out of a situation they may not want to be in or simply jump to different star systems at faster-than-light speeds.





 3  KE-49A Autocannon (4,500 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 60
        

Manufactured by Ballistic Solutions Inc., the KE-49A Autocannon is one of the best weapons a ship can have in Starfield. It isn&#39;t an early game purchase, though, as the Spacefarer must be level 60 and have a Starship Design rank 4 to use it. Once obtained, however, this Autocannon can easily turn the tide in any conflict with hostile spacecraft, with hull damage stats of 30, shield damage stats of 9, and a fire rate of 5.00. Despite it being so effective in battle and requiring so much experience from the player, it is a surprisingly affordable weapon costing only 4,500 Credits.

 2  Atlatl 280C Missile Launcher (47,500 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 43


 







Speaking of effective weapons, the Atlatl 280C would be best described as slow but deadly, with an incredible 264 damage output for both the hull and shields on the ships of enemies. This unparalleled Missile Launcher only maintains a fire rate of 1.00, yet the Atlatl 280C&#39;s astonishing damage output makes it a must-have for any top-tier spacecraft. Because it only requires a level of 43 to obtain and a cost of 47,500 Credits, the Atlatl is generally able to be used starting in mid-game in Starfield. 





 1  Poseidon DT230 Engine (42,400 Credits) 
Ship Part Unlock Level 58
        

Creating the best possible ship in the game doesn&#39;t just rely on cannons and turrets; it also requires the best speed and ability to maneuver deftly through the cosmos with the powers of an efficient engine module. The ultimate engine in Starfield, and perhaps the best ship module in the game, is the Poseidon DT230. With an engine thrust of 34,520, a maneuvering thrust of 11,600, and an engine health of 140, the Poseidon DT230 puts any other engine to shame. Although it is expensive, valued at 42,400 Credits, this is a worthwhile investment.
