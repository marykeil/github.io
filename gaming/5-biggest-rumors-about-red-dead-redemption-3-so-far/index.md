## Literature Review

Although Red Dead Redemption 3 hasn&#39;t been confirmed by Rockstar, plenty of rumors about its setting, protagonists, and plot are up in the air.




Rockstar&#39;s Red Dead Redemption franchise includes some of the most highly-praised and definitive RPGs of the 21st century, and many eyes are looking ahead at Red Dead Redemption 3. Red Dead&#39;s Wild West adventures follow the Van der Linde gang and characters connected to it, spanning more than a decade across the two flagship entries into the series. Now that it&#39;s been five years since the release of RDR2, conversations around a possible third entry into the series are starting to build some serious traction.
Still, there are plenty of rumors that the game could already be in development, and what it might entail. Considering the overall success of the franchise, plus the fact RDR2 was reportedly in development for more than 8 years, with concept work beginning even before the release of Red Dead Redemption in 2010, it&#39;s not unreasonable at all to expect that a third game could already be on the table behind the scenes. Without any official info, rumor and educated speculation are the sole sources of RDR3 info currently. Popular theories regarding the game&#39;s setting, potential protagonists, plot, and even its release date are hot topics of discussion on social media, forums, and news sites.
            
 
 Why Red Dead Redemption 3 Is Almost A Certainty 
After the rousing success of Red Dead Redemption 2, a third installment is almost certain. Red Dead Redemption 3 might happen sooner than you think.













 








 5  Red Dead Redemption 3 Would Likely Be A Prequel To The Prequel 
RDR3 Could Be Set Sometime Before 1899
        

One of the most popular speculations is that Red Dead Redemption 3 would most likely have to take place before the events of Red Dead Redemption 2 in order to maintain the game&#39;s core atmosphere and themes. The leading opinion on this front comes from Rob Wiethoff, who voices John Marston in the games, per his interview with Sackchief on YouTube. The story of the original Red Dead Redemption marked, according to Wiethoff, the &#34;end of an era&#34;, so any chronological sequel would be forced into a more modern setting, with advanced technologies like cars potentially spoiling the Wild West themes of the game.
Since 2010&#39;s Red Dead Redemption took place in 1911, and 2018&#39;s Red Dead Redemption 2 fills the gap between 1899 and the original game, there&#39;s no real room for a Red Dead Redemption sequel between the two, unless it addresses entirely separate stories within the same setting. With a post-1911 setting likely out of the question for thematic reasons, a prequel to the events of RDR2 makes the most sense. Red Dead Redemption 3 being set pre-1899 would offer Rock Star Games an opportunity to explore the stories of numerous different characters from the franchise, namely the earliest events of the Van der Linde gang.





 4  Red Dead Redemption 3 Could Continue Jack Marston&#39;s Story 
Jack Marston May Be The Protagonist Of RDR3


 







Although some argue that RDR3 shouldn&#39;t continue into the later parts of the 20th century, a chronological sequel isn&#39;t impossible. Perhaps the most obvious potential protagonist for such a sequel is Jack Marston. The modernizing setting would require some adapting in terms of both themes and game mechanics (particularly as it regards firearms), but the core narrative themes could still thrive, most notably the theme of redemption. At the end of Red Dead Redemption, Jack avenges his father John by killing Edgar Ross. Unfortunately, this continues a cycle of outlaw living his father had hoped for his son to escape.
Red Dead Redemption 3 as Jack&#39;s redemption story makes perfect sense given the themes of both previous games and where the story left off chronologically. Since Jack entered the outlaw life at the end of the previous game by murdering a retired marshal, a sequel could explore the resulting spiral â€” does Jack sink deeper into crime or find a way out? Some discussions via Reddit, such as one started by YoungBeef03, have even suggested the game taking place as far forward as post-WWI, with Jack returning from the fight to face a more modern world and escape the violence of his past.





 3  Red Dead Redemption 3&#39;s Protagonist Could Be Dutch 
The Van der Linde Gang&#39;s Leader Could Be The Star of RDR3
        

Though Dutch Van der Linde opposes the protagonist in Red Dead Redemption, he is mostly an ally in the prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2. A popular rumor so far is that the main protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 3 could be the gang leader himself. Though the main events that led Dutch to founding the Van der Linde gang are spelled out in summary, there&#39;s plenty of room for details, twists, character development, and different relationships to be explored. Whether enough space exists to meaningfully fill a third game is up for debate. On the other hand, an argument can also be made that Dutch isn&#39;t needed for Red Dead Redemption 3, or that his presence may even be squeezing an empty lemon.





 2  Red Dead Redemption 3&#39;s Protagonist Could Be Mac Callander 
Mac Callander&#39;s RDR3 Could Explore The Early Van der Linde Gang
        

Some people have speculated that the Callander boys could be the focus of the story in a prequel-style Red Dead Redemption 3. Although Mac is actually deceased by the time of Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s events, his story is related in vague and unreliable fashion from the perspectives of multiple other characters, including Arthur Morgan, Uncle, and Agent Milton. The reports of Milton, specifically, could be of interest, considering his character isn&#39;t necessarily the most trustworthy (an idea put forth by Redditor RedDeadObsession).


Focusing on Mac Callander would offer plenty of space to explore the early Van der Linde gang, but also the lives of Mac and his brother before the gang. A strong argument can be made that the Red Dead franchise would be best served moving on to the stories of other characters farther removed from the gang than those of the previous two major entires, so a prequel that told the Callander boys&#39; story before they joined the gang may be most ideal.





 1  RDR3 Might Not Happen Until The Next Console Generation 
Why RDR3 Probably Won&#39;t Release Until After 2026
        

Bigger than any questions regarding the content of Red Dead Redemption 3, the matter of its potential release date is the heart of most rumor and speculation today. Given that the Grand Theft Auto 6 release seems to be Rockstar&#39;s main focus at this time, it&#39;s unlikely RDR3 will be coming out any time soon. The eight-year gap between Red Dead Redemption and RDR2 also suggest Rockstar likes to take its time when making such games.
Red Dead Redemption released in 2010, while RDR2 came out in 2018. 

If another eight-year gap defined RDR3&#39;s development timeline, 2026 would be the earliest the game might arrive. However, with the next generation of consoles possibly arriving as early as 2028 per Neowin, information made available thanks to the legal battle between the FTC and Microsoft, 2026 might spell a particularly awkward time for a release. Whether Rockstar would prefer to wait for the next generation, combining that excitement with anticipation for Red Dead Redemption 3, is unknown, but it would certainly make sense.
