## Literature Review

One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.




New Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks are hinting at a big change at how team comps can be organized. Ahead of the update’s arrival, which is expected to occur in late January, there have been several pieces of information regarding the upcoming content. One of the most notable ones is the release of Cloud Retainer in Genshin Impact, which was confirmed by HoYoverse following some leaks that stated her human playable form would be added in Version 4.4.




Aside from the adepti’s release, there have also been leaked skins in Genshin Impact 4.4, which may even be connected to the story being told in the update. The most noticeable leaks tend to be those that revolve around new playable content, even if it is merely aesthetic. Nevertheless, HoYoverse’s RPG has been getting a series of quality-of-life (QoL) updates, such as the quick claim of rewards from expeditions. One such tweak, which may change team comp structures, has allegedly been leaked and is expected for Version 4.4.

According to some information posted by the well-known leaker called Kuroo, later shared by AuntieAttW on Reddit, the maximum amount of party slots in the game will be increased from 10 to 15 with the arrival of Version 4.4. At the moment, players can prepare 10 team comps for quick and easy switching. This allows players to shift from a Hyperbloom team to a Permafreeze team comp in Genshin Impact, for instance, with a single button instead of having to manually change each character every time they want to alter their strategy.



As is the case with any other Genshin Impact leak, this should be taken with a grain of salt, as the information may be inaccurate or subject to change – it may even be pushed into another future update rather than Version 4.4 itself.






 More Party Slots In Genshin Impact Are A Welcome Addition 
          




Despite being a relatively simple quality-of-life addition, this leaked information is actually great news when it comes to players who invest heavily in maintaining different types of team comps. As of Version 4.3, there are 77 playable characters, with two more on the way in Version 4.4. The sheer amount of heroes, be they 4-star or 5-star, allows for endless team combinations. Because the core gameplay of Genshin Impact relies heavily on triggering Elemental Reactions and exploiting weaknesses, it is necessary for players to have multiple teams ready to fight.

The weekly boss Andrius, for instance, is quite resistant against Anemo and Cryo DMG, so it is best to not use characters of such an element when fighting it. To beat the Wolf of the North challenge, it is recommended to use a Pyro-based team comp. This same team, however, would have a hard time when facing the weekly boss La Signora since she has a Pyro phase. The Genshin Impact 4.4 leak about extra party slots is great news, as it will allow players to prepare teams to face the most diverse opponents and situations, be they in combat or exploration.
