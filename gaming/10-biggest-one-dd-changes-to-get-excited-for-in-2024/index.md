# 10 Biggest One D&amp;D Changes To Get Excited For In 2024


## SUMMARY 


 One D&amp;D is set to evolve 5e 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons
, but playtests of the new rulest have been contentious thus far. 
 There are, however, a number of changes coming in One D&amp;D that can already be considered an improvement. 
 Balancing classes in a number of ways will help One D&amp;D improve parity between builds, but there are also brand-new features, as well as more pointed changes to spells, feats, cantrips, and more.

## Literature Review

One D&amp;D will changes Dungeons &amp; Dragons in big ways, and some of them actually offer exciting new possibilities or fix long-standing complaints.




One D&amp;D is set to shake up Dungeons &amp; Dragons when it arrives as the newest incarnation of the roleplaying game in 2024, and some of its changes are easy to get excited about. Anticipation for One D&amp;D is somewhat mixed, with contentious choices and a recent history of game license changes serving to sacrifice some goodwill from the tabletop community. Even so, there are plenty of new ideas coming in 2024 that have solid foundations and interesting implications.
Unlike numbered editions of DnD, One D&amp;D is more of a revision to the DnD 5e system, filling a somewhat similar role to the 3.5e update for the third edition of the game. Backward compatibility ensures that 5e materials will still be usable in One D&amp;D play, while any group that doesn&#39;t want to make the transition should likewise find new material easy to incorporate without accepting every rule change. For those who do want to take advantage of a new start, the best changes could freshen up any campaign.

 10  Bastions 
One D&amp;D Has A Base-Building System
        

Although dungeon crawling and fighting monsters have some of the most immediate appeal of anything in DnD, some of the more managerial aspects of the game can be just as engaging. Bastions, set to be introduced in One D&amp;D, are perfect for parties that like to build up a useful home base. Bastions can generate passive income and feature a number of useful facilities, making it easier for the party to have access to specific functions and resources whenever they&#39;re needed. Although the loose idea of a home base is nothing new, DnD 5e didn&#39;t offer any specific system for building one, making this an exciting addition.





 9  Feat Level Requirements 
Not All Feats Are Created Equal Feats are a fun way to spice up a character&#39;s abilities in DnD 5e, but they were never a particularly balanced system. One D&amp;D attempts to even things out by tying feats to specific levels, making it easy to keep or add exciting ideas for powerful feats without rendering less effective ones irrelevant. Ability score improvements are also connected to feats in One D&amp;D, helping to integrate them into the game in a more complete way.





 8  Interesting Rangers 
One D&amp;D Focuses On The Best Ranger Options


 







Playtests for One D&amp;D rules have been fairly volatile when it comes to Rangers, so it&#39;s not yet clear what exactly they&#39;ll look like in the final game. At any rate, however, they should be more interesting than they are in the DnD 5e Player&#39;s Handbook. Many, if not most, DnD tables have generally accepted the reinterpretation of Rangers presented in Tasha&#39;s Cauldron of Everything as an improvement, and One D&amp;D is set to move key changes from Tasha&#39;s to the core ruleset while adding new spells and Weapon Mastery.

 7  Flexible Spell Lists 
All Spellcasters Get Some Freedom
        

Spell lists are another One D&amp;D feature that has seen plenty of back-and-forth, but it&#39;s safe to say that they won&#39;t work the same way across the board as in DnD 5e. Classes that previously had set spell lists should get at least some form of flexibility, whether it&#39;s in the form of swapping out a spell per level or per day. Attempts to remove the idea of class-specific spell lists didn&#39;t go over well, however, so it&#39;s unlikely that the playtest experiments involving that particular idea will return.





 6  Updated Cantrips 
Bad Cantrips Are Better In One D&amp;D
        

Cantrips can be a hard thing to balance, as these infinitely available spells need enough utility to stay relevant but not enough power to render them easily abused. One D&amp;D makes a number of cantrip changes to try to even this out. Spare the dying, for example, now has a range that increases with level, while shocking grasp is nerfed to shut down opportunity attacks rather than all reactions (but works with equal efficacy on targets with or without metal armor). Hopefully, the final cantrip list in One D&amp;D will offer a better balance than the options in DnD 5e.





 5  Simpler Exhaustion 
One D&amp;D Makes Exhaustion Mechanics Easier
        

Exhaustion can be a tricky and tiresome system in DnD 5e, and it&#39;s not uncommon for campaigns to ignore it altogether. It can certainly be useful, especially for survival-oriented stories, but not every table sees it as worth the trouble. One D&amp;D should help universalize it by making each level of exhaustion equivalent to -1 on d20 rolls, making it easy to keep track of and generally manageable. For campaigns that want a grittier and more involved take, Wizards of the Coast is unlikely to prosecute anyone for sticking with the 5e approach.





 4  Overhauled Counterspell 
Counterspell Doesn&#39;t Destroy Spell Slots
        

Counterspell can be great fun to use on an enemy, but being on the receiving end is always annoying in DnD. One D&amp;D changes counterspell so that it no longer makes the targeted character lose the spell slot, as well as switching defense against counterspell to a Constitution save rather than an ability check. These changes better represent the idea of interrupting spellcasting while dodging the crushing feeling of losing a valuable spell slot at a critical moment.





 3  Barbarian Versatility 
Rage Isn&#39;t Just For Combat In One D&amp;D


 







Barbarians are great fun in DnD combat, but they don&#39;t often offer as much as other classes outside of that. One D&amp;D attempts to give barbarians more to do off of the battlefield, looking at Rage as more of a magical force with wide-reaching applications and preparing some features that have to do with more than smashing. The new Path of the World Tree subclass is a great look at the increased diversity of barbarian flavor, with interesting healing and transportation abilities to benefit the party.





 2  Better Backgrounds 
One D&amp;D Adds More Flavor &amp; Utility To Backgrounds
        

Backgrounds are an important part of the roleplaying experience, giving context for the overall nature of a character&#39;s past life within the official system of rules. In DnD 5e, however, backgrounds can feel underemphasized, with an array of basic choices having minimal impact on the game. One D&amp;D is set to tie feats into backgrounds as well as promote the customization of a background, souping up character creation in a way that makes a character&#39;s past feel as valuable in-system as it is in roleplay.





 1  Weapon Mastery 
Martial Classes Get More Specialization


 







Weapon Mastery provides an interesting way to give martial classes a little more focus on specialization, helping narrow the gap between them and spellcasters in this regard. A martial character can select specific Weapon Mastery choices in character creation, which then gives them access to unique advantages when using the weapons in question. This adds a bit of extra fun to leaning into specific styles of fighting that can&#39;t be found within the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e system, fun which can be furthered by selecting the Brawler fighter subclass for Mastery with improvised weapons in One D&amp;D.
