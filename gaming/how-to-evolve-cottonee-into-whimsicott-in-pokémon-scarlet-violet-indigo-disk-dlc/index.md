## Literature Review

Cottonee is a Grass-/Fairy-type Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet that can be caught in the Indigo Disk DLC. This monster can evolve into Whimsicott.





Despite its cute and innocent appearance, Whimsicott can hold its own in battles with its impressive speed and debilitating moves. A good example is Cotton Spore, which can reduce the opponent&#39;s speed by two stages, making it a valuable asset in battles. Fairy-type is also incredibly powerful on the team, being an excellent counter to both Dragon- and Dark-type Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet.

Trainers wishing to catch a Cottonee must travel to the Coastal Biome in the Blueberry Academy Terarium. They appear in the northern part of the region, along with its evolution, Whimsicott. However, you can also obtain the second form using a Sun Stone. One is granted during the Artazon Hide-And-Seek gym test during the base game. If you are having trouble obtaining a Sun Stone, Whimsicott can be found in 4-star Tera Raid Battles in Scarlet and Violet as well. 



Whimsicott can only be found in 4-star Tera Raid Battles in the Blueberry Academy Terarium.

Even if you are not looking to add Cottonee or Whimsicott to your team, both must complete the Blueberry Pokédex for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC. As you can expect, trainers will earn rewards at specific increments based on the number of Pokémon caught. This can be something as simple as some experience candy, but you can also earn more valuable items, such as a Max Revive.


 




The trainers of Blueberry Academy specialize in double battles, making Pokémon like Whimsicott a valuable asset. Utilize this Grass-/Fairy-type to change the flow of battle with controlling moves, such as cotton spool and tailwind. The Indigo Disk DLC is an excellent opportunity to experiment and try out new team members in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
