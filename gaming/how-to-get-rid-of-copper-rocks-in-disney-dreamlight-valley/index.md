## Literature Review

If you want to remove copper rocks in Disney Dreamlight Valley so you can explore more of Eternity Isle, it&#39;s time to upgradeÂ your Royale Pickaxe.





As you progress deeper into Eternity Isles, you will be required to remove both small and large copper rocks. Doing so will yield copper, a material used in various crafting recipes. More importantly, however, you will want to break large copper rocks to access the expansion&#39;s new areas, which contain valuable items such as collecting gems on Eternity Isles.




                  Disney Dreamlight Valley: How To Move Villagers Between The Valley &amp; Eternity Isle   The new expansion for Disney Dreamlight Valley introduces an area called Eternity Isle, a place that you can move Villagers to from your own Valley.

Removing small copper rocks in Disney Dreamlight Valley is as simple as progressing through the A Rift in Time Expansions storyline. On the other hand, large copper rocks will require a little more effort before they can be mined. You gain the ability to mine small copper rocks during Jafar&#39;s &#34;The Flying Metal Nuisance&#34; quest.

As you progress through this quest, which occurs fairly early in the expansion&#39;s storyline, Jafar will upgrade your Royal Pickaxe, allowing you to mine small copper rocks for copper. It&#39;s as simple as that. However, you will have to put in the leg work yourself to remove large copper rocks.




How To Remove Large Copper Rocks
To mine and remove large copper rocks, you will first need to upgrade your Royal Hourglass to level 1, which will cost 5,000 Mist. Once you&#39;ve got enough mist, head to a Timebending Table to upgrade the Royal Hourglass. Now, you can collect Ancient Cores using the Hourglasses Timebending ability, one of the items you will need to upgrade your Royal Pickaxe to remove large copper rocks.



The best way to get a lot of Mist quickly in Disney Dreamlight Valley is to complete Mist Duties, with six available and refreshed daily.




To upgrade your Royal Pickaxe so it can mine large copper rocks, you&#39; will need to craft a Large Copper Rocks Pickaxe Potion at the Timebending Table. This potion will require 3,000 Mist, 1 Ancient Core (Level 1), and 40 Copper. Once you&#39;ve gathered all the required items, go to a Timebending Table, select the &#34;Special&#34; category, and create the Copper Rocks Pickaxe Potion. As soon as you make the potion, the upgrade will automatically apply to your Royal Pickaxe, which you can now use to remove large copper rocks from Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
