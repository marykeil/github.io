## Literature Review

Magic items in The Book of Many Things are based on cards from the classic artifact, the Deck of Many Things, and these are the ones to get ASAP.




The Deck of Many Things has been a fan-favorite item in Dungeons &amp; Dragons for nearly 50 years. It was introduced in 1975, and since then, players have been chancing their luck in hopes of winning what might as well be a fantasy lottery. With the 2023 release of The Book of Many Things, Wizards of the Coast has added even more cards to draw and a slew of never-before-seen magic items that the 5e version of the Deck can bestow on players lucky enough to draw the right card.
The Book of Many Things includes 58 magic items for Dungeon Masters to distribute to characters. Many of the items are themed around one of the unique cards from the deck itself. Drawing the Gem card may be the most on-theme way for adventurers to find these new treasures, but considering how powerful and fun many of them are, lots of DMs and players may want to stack the Deck to get them into play ASAP.

 7  Skull Helm 
Summons Reaper Spirit &amp; Resists Poison, Necrotic, &amp; Cold Damage
        

 One of the most fun and terrifying cards to draw from the Deck of Many Things is the Skull card. When drawn, the card summons an Avatar of Death that only has eyes for the person who drew the card and summoned it. The creature will stop at nothing to kill the character and claim their soul.
The Skull Helm instead puts the player in the driver&#39;s seat and allows them to summon and control a lesser version of the creature called a Reaper Spirit. Not only that, the skull-shaped helmet gives the wearer resistance to poison, necrotic, and cold damage. This puts players in a better position if and when they draw the Skull card itself and have to fight the Avatar.





 6  Rogue&#39;s Mantle 
Grants Darkvision &amp; Teleportation


 







Not only does the Rogue&#39;s Mantle give a character the ability to cast the new antagonize spell to have an enemy attack their own teammates, but the wearer also gains darkvision. While many DnD races have darkvision by default, humans and other popular races are left to rely on spells or torches to make their way through the dark.
But best of all, the Rogue&#39;s Mantle grants the ability teleport as a bonus action. There are no charges or limits on the number of uses, either. The only drawback is that the character has to be in dim light or darkness to begin with, and they can only teleport to another space with dim light or darkness. So while they won&#39;t be able to hop around open fields filled with sunshine, most towns, dungeons, and locations are filled with pockets of dim light.
Because the item doesn&#39;t count as armor, any class can take advantage of these boons. A wizard can keep out of danger by hopping from shadow to shadow so they can avoid drawing a monster&#39;s attention, or a raging barbarian might smash two villains on opposite sides of the room without taking a step.





 5  Crown Of Whirling Comets 
Grants The Wearer Three Different Abilities The Crown of Whirling Comets deserves its Very Rare status. The silver crown has six charges that users can expend in three different ways, and those charges refill each morning at dawn by 1d6. Luckily, the crown does not get destroyed even if all the charges are used. Each charge is represented by a gem on the crown, and true to its name, they will orbit the wearer&#39;s head, spinning like comets until used. Players can use one charge to give themselves the ability to fly for 10 minutes, and they shimmer with a starlight glow while aloft. They can expend three charges to cast ice storm, which deals a ton of damage and makes the ground icy and difficult to stand on. Finally, the Starlight Strike ability is a guaranteed-hit attack ability like Magic Missile, but each icy bolt deals twice as much damage as its beloved cousin.





 4  Card Sharp&#39;s Deck 
Two Different Card Tricks
        

No sourcebook about a magical deck of cards would be complete without a magic item that lets players throw those cards at monsters. The Book of Many Things describes the Card Sharp&#39;s Deck as a simple deck of cards that shimmers around the edges. It gives players two different ways to paper cut their enemies like Gambit from the X-Men.
The Deadly Deal ability is an action to make a ranged spell attack using Dexterity to deal 1d8 force damage to a target within 120 feet. Using Dexterity for the roll makes this item more helpful to martial Dungeons &amp; Dragons classes like rogues and fighters who don&#39;t get a lot of force-damage abilities that can bypass common resistances. The Spray of Cards ability will blind opponents caught in a 15-foot cone of fluttering spectral cards, as well as deal 2d10 force damage.





 3  Warrior&#39;s Passkey 
Used To Unlock Doors &amp; As A Weapon
        

The knock spell is one of the underutilized gems in Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, even though it can unlock mundane locks, or open doors that are stuck or barred. Because it&#39;s a second-level spell, low-to-mid-level casters are unlikely to keep it prepared. With the Warrior&#39;s Passkey, that&#39;s not an issue anymore. The attuned player can cast knock as an action as many times as they want, as the item has no charges. Plus, it can turn into a &#43;1 longsword the character is automatically proficient with.
Even better, the longsword deals force damage. This means it&#39;s less likely to be resisted than the standard longsword piercing damage or other types of magical damage. Bladesinger wizards and Hexblade warlocks will find the Warrior&#39;s Passkey especially enticing and worth drawing from the Deck of Many Things to test their luck.





 2  Ring Of Puzzler&#39;s Wit 
Grants Advantage On Intelligence Checks
        

The Ring of Puzzler&#39;s Wit is a simple, uncommon magic item from The Book of Many Things. It only does one thing, but that thing is important to almost any character who isn&#39;t a wizard or artificer. Intelligence is seen in DnD 5e by many as the so-called dump stat, where players will invest the lowest number of ability points.
That means those characters often fail at Intelligence checks and saves. The Ring of Puzzler&#39;s Wit has three charges, and players can use one of them to roll an Intelligence check with advantage. While it would be much more powerful if a character could get advantage on Intelligence saving throws instead of just checks, the ring is worth seeking out ASAP to fill a major gap that lots of 5e characters have.
            
 
 Dungeons &amp; Dragons: How DMs Can Make Intelligence Matter 
Despite usually being considered a &#34;dump stat&#34; in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there are a few ways that DMs can make sure Intelligence makes a difference.









 1  Boomerang Shield 
A Shield With A Ranged Attack
        

The Boomerang Shield gives players the perfect opportunity to roleplay a Captain America-type character, such as an Oath of Devotion paladin. Players can throw the shield as a ranged attack to deal 1d6 slashing damage. Whether or not the throw is a hit or miss, the shield reappears in the player&#39;s hand immediately.
Unfortunately, the ranged attack costs a full action to use, unlike other shield moves such as the bonus action slam granted by 5e&#39;s Shield Master feat. Even with that, the Boomerang Shield is one of the most fun items in The Book of Many Things. Since it&#39;s an uncommon magic item, a lot of Dungeons &amp; Dragons players shouldn&#39;t have a terribly difficult time finding one.
