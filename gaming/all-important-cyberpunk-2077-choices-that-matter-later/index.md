# All Important Cyberpunk 2077 Choices That Matter Later


## SUMMARY 



  Some choices in Cyberpunk 2077 are hidden in optional objectives or side jobs and can have a significant impact on quests and storylines.   Choosing to spare or kill certain characters, such as Woodman or Oda, can affect later events and dialogue options in the game.   Players can unlock additional side quests and storylines by exploring every side job and making specific choices throughout the game.

## Literature Review

In a game as long and complex as Cyberpunk 2077, it can be frustrating to face unexpected consequences hours after making a small decision.




Cyberpunk 2077 is full of choices that can change the outcome of the game, not only changing which final ending is unlocked but also which romances can happen and even whether certain gigs and jobs will be available down the road. Players may not always learn the consequences of their choices until much later in the game, and some subtle decisions can even affect which of the game&#39;s multiple endings will be triggered. Players may also miss some critical choices, impressive loot and weapons, and lore in Cyberpunk entirely if V doesn’t explore every side job the game has to offer.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC.]

While Cyberpunk 2077 usually makes it obvious which choices are going to have a major impact on the game, some of these decisions are hidden in optional objectives or side jobs. The base game&#39;s main storyline alone is 30 hours long, with the Phantom Liberty DLC adding another 14-plus hours to that total. Add in the dozens of side jobs, gigs, and NCPD scanner hustles, and the game&#39;s total length is extended even more, to an average of over 100 hours of gameplay to see 100% completion. Making the wrong decision early in the game could lead to a bad outcome many hours later, or could impact V’s possible endings.

                  10 Best Hidden Secret Events In Cyberpunk 2077   Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC are full of secret side missions and lore that is hidden away for players to stumble across while playing.   


 The Heist: Where To Send Jackie 
Main Job In Little China
         




At the end of &#34;The Heist,&#34; Delamain asks V where to send Jackie’s body. It doesn’t seem like that important of a choice in Cyberpunk 2077 at the time, but V’s selection here does affect later quests and storylines. If V chooses to send Jackie’s body back to his family or asks Delamain to wait until they get back from the meet with Dex, then V will be invited to a memorial service by Mama Welles in the &#34;Heroes&#34; side job. If V chooses to send Jackie’s body to the ripperdoc, they miss out on the memorial but get additional dialogue and storylines later in the game.



 Automatic Love: Kill Woodman or Let Him Live 
Main Job In Kabuki
          

In &#34;Automatic Love,&#34; V needs to deal with Woodman, the owner of Clouds, who’s partially responsible for Evelyn’s fate. V has three options: storm into Woodman’s office gun’s blazing and kill everyone, sneak in and interrogate Woodman before killing him, or interrogate Woodman and let him live. If V chooses to kill Woodman, it’s a pretty standard boss fight, and then he’s removed from the story. If V lets Woodman live, they’ll have to deal with that decision in Cyberpunk 2077 later, specifically in Judy’s side job &#34;Ex-Factor.&#34;






 Gimme Danger: Reconnaissance With Takemura 
Main Job In Japantown
          

In &#34;Gimme Danger,&#34; Takemura decides to do some reconnaissance before the parade, and V has the option to join him. Doing so gives V information about the building’s weak points, and allows them to have a deep conversation with Takemura that will cement their friendship. This has a significant impact on future dialogue choices in the game and can affect one of the endings. If V sent Jackie’s body to Vik at the end of &#34;The Heist,&#34; Takemura will share that Jackie’s body was intercepted by Arasaka and that they plan to use Soulkiller on him to extract information and create an engram.

                  Cyberpunk 2077: All Cyberpunk Slang Explained   From delta to gonk, becoming familiar with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s slang terms and what they mean can be crucial to getting the most out of the experience.   






 Play It Safe: Defeating Oda 
Main Job In Japantown
          

In &#34;Play It Safe,&#34; V needs to take down Oda, Hanako Arasaka’s bodyguard. After V defeats Oda, Takemura calls and asks them to spare Oda’s life. If V chooses to shoot Oda, he’s gone from the game for good, but if V spares his life, then Oda can potentially show up later in one of the endings. This choice in Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t influence the story in any real way, but it can add some extra flavor to the ending of Cyberpunk 2077.

                  What Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Happiest Ending For V Really Is   Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s varied story endings are bittersweet at best. There may be no &#34;happily ever after&#34; in Night City, but which ending is V&#39;s happiest?   



 Search And Destroy: Rescue Takemura 
Main Job In Vista Del Ray
          




This is a truly hidden decision in Cyberpunk 2077 because there isn’t a quest objective or dialogue option that tells V this is a possibility. After Arasaka forces storm the building in &#34;Search and Destroy,&#34; V gets separated from Takemura and needs to fight a bunch of enemies and escape. The quest objective leads V out of the building, but in order to save Takemura, V will need to go upstairs and rescue him first. Saving Takemura allows players to unlock the trophy or achievement called The Devil (if they chose the corresponding ending), and Takemura will show up during the Epilogue.



 Happy Together: Save Barry 
Side Job In Little China
          

In &#34;Happy Together,&#34; V’s neighbor Barry is going through a tough time after the death of his best friend. Barry’s colleagues from NCPD ask V to check in on him. In order to get the best outcome of this quest, V must speak to Barry within an unspecified amount of time, or the quest will auto-complete and fail. After speaking to Barry, V can visit Andrew’s memorial, where they find out he’s a tortoise. Then V needs to report back to the NCPD officers and tell them the truth about Andrew. If V leaves that part out, the officers don’t realize how much danger Barry is in, and Barry ends up taking his own life.






 The Beast In Me: Revenge Or Mercy 
Side Job In Arroyo
          

&#34;The Beast In Me&#34; involves a series of street races organized by Claire, a bartender at the Afterlife. After the Santa Domingo race, Claire reveals to V that she wants help to kill Sampson as revenge. V can try to convince Claire not to take revenge or to support her, which affects Cyberpunk 2077 choices made later in the questline. Regardless of what V chooses, in the last race, Claire wants V to stick close to Sampson&#39;s tail, so she can shoot him. If V ignores Claire and treats this like a normal Cyberpunk 2077 street race, they’ll get the winnings, but Claire will act coldly towards them when they see her later in the Afterlife.

                  Cyberpunk 2077: All Free Car and Vehicle Locations   Cyberpunk 2077 lets players drive through Night City in tons of different vehicles. A lot of them pricey, but there are plenty of free cars to find.   




If V does what Claire asks, they’ll lose the race, and be faced with another choice. If V allows Claire to take her revenge, they’ll win Claire’s unique truck as a reward. If V tries to convince Claire to spare Sampson, the outcome depends on what V chooses to do after the Santa Domingo race. If they tried to talk Claire out of revenge, Claire will spare Sampson now, and V will get both Claire’s truck and Sampson’s unique car as rewards. If V didn’t try to talk Claire out of revenge before, attempting to at this point will fail and Claire will kill Sampson.



 Dream On: What To Tell Jefferson 
Side Job In Charter Hill And Corpo Plaza
          

In &#34;Dream On,&#34; V finds evidence that a mystery organization is performing mind control on the Peralez couple and altering their memories. Elizabeth Peralez begs V not to tell Jefferson the truth out of fear for his safety. When V meets with Jefferson at the end of the quest, they can choose to tell him the truth, or lie and point the finger in another direction. Whichever option V chooses, Jefferson thanks them and concludes the mission.




After that moment, V receives some concerning text messages from Jefferson and Elizabeth before they block V’s number, and V doesn’t hear from them for the rest of the game. If V chooses to tell Jefferson the truth, he’ll call during the end credits of Cyberpunk 2077 and talk in a panicked voice about how “they” are changing him.



 Phantom Liberty: Rescuing President Myers 
DLC Main Job In Dogtown
         

Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s expansion DLC, Phantom Liberty, revolves around the story of what has happened to President Rosalind Myers and V&#39;s mission to save her. Interestingly, however, V can choose to simply let the President die. This will not be a game over, but it does lock the player out of being able to experience the DLC content on that character anymore. Instead, Johnny will explain to V that they are responsible for the President&#39;s death and then the rest of the base game for Cyberpunk 2077 can continue. 






 Phantom Liberty: Choosing Reed Or Songbird 
DLC Main Job In Dogtown
         

The ultimate choice in the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077 is whether to side with Solomon Reed or Songbird in the events following the mission &#34;Firestarter.&#34; There are two different, yet equally important, points here that require choice. First, whether to activate the Icebreaker at the stadium, and second is what V will do when confronted with Reed at the spaceport. The decisions made will decide not only the ending V gets for the expansion, but can also unlock a new ending for the base game. In order to unlock the new ending to Cyberpunk 2077, ultimately, V must leave Songbird alive while also siding with Reed.

                  Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Should You Side With Reed Or Songbird?   At the end of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, V is forced to pick sides: Reed or Songbird? Their decision affects both the DLC and the base game.   




In a game as long and complex as Cyberpunk 2077, it can be frustrating to face unexpected consequences hours after making an innocuous decision. Most of the hidden choices in Cyberpunk 2077 do not have a major impact on the ending, but they can add depth to the story and unlock more side quests later in the game. For those quests that do change outcomes, it can be disappointing to find out too late that one small choice led to a desired ending being blocked off.
