## Literature Review

The fast-paced FPS action of Ready or Not make it difficult to adapt to situations, but combat veterans who stay calm can earn an S-Rank for missions.





The mechanics of Ready or Not make it one of the best FPS games of 2021, and this is due in no small part to the delicate nature of its mission structure. Each level has multiple facets, with incredibly small details you could miss on your first playthrough. Make sure to replay missions often to learn their patterns in preparation for an S-Rank attempt in the future.




                  FPS Games That Show Call Of Duty How It&#39;s Really Done   While Call of Duty has dominated the shooter market for close to two decades, new FPS games have emerged that provide a more immersive experience.   


 How To Get S-Rank For Missions in Ready or Not 
          

An S-Rank is earned in Ready or Not when you report every Dead Body, Civilian, and Suspect while completing all Soft Objectives seen in a level. You also must ensure no fellow officer is injured during a mission and that every piece of evidence is secured. Another aspect of this process is not to kill anyone throughout a mission since this can reduce your points below the level needed for an S-Rank.

Every task listed below is worth a certain amount of points that fill up a circle at the end of missions in Ready or Not. An S-Rank is given when you fill-up the whole circle with every point available in a mission. This means you can&#39;t make any mistakes or skip content presented on a level that may seem optional at first.






Make sure you know how to Sprint with your character during missions. One of the best ways to not lose points is to know when to retreat quickly from a bad situation to some form of safety.




The best way to approach these goals is to take your time on every mission you want to S-Rank. There are no time limits on levels in Ready or Not, so you can approach every task slowly and carefully. Those who have already explored a mission beforehand should better understand which Soft Objectives are available to complete during a run.

                  Ready or Not Game Loses Publisher After School Shooting Comment   After an enthusiastic Ready or Not dev comment on the inclusion of a school shooter level caused controversy, the game has lost its publisher.    

Retry levels as many times as needed to earn an S-Rank in Ready or Not to prove your expertise in this game&#39;s difficult, realistic combat scenarios.
