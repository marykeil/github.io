## Literature Review

The recently released Ancient Roar Pokémon TCG set features a number of secret rare cards, many of which have beautiful art and will be highly prized.




On October 27, 2023, the Japanese Pokémon Trading Card Game card sets, Ancient Roar and Future Flash were released. Though some of the cards from the Ancient Roar and Future Flash sets are fairly forgettable, many of them, particularly a few of the 58 Secret Rares, are incredibly beautiful and are, without question, cards that many of the most dedicated and discerning Pokémon TCG connoisseurs and collectors will undoubtedly want to have in their collections.
An English version of the Pokémon TCG Paradox Rift expansion is set to be released on November 3, 2023, and will include a number of the cards from Ancient Roar and Future Flash. While the value of the cards from this set isn&#39;t yet available and likely won&#39;t be stable until long after the set releases in November 2023, here are ten of the best, coolest, and most visually stunning cards from Ancient Roar and Future Flash that collectors will want to keep an eye out for, and will want to acquire as soon as possible
            
 
 Pokémon TCG: 10 Paradox Rift Cards You&#39;ll Definitely Want To Collect 
Pokémon TCG’s upcoming Scarlet &amp; Violet: Paradox Rift expansion is introducing many new cards, including beautiful full-art collectible cards.













 








 10  Morpeko (Gen 8) 
Ancient Roar Card 76/66
        

Introduced during Generation 8, Morpeko is an Electric- and Dark-type Pokémon that constantly generates electricity with the sacs in its cheeks. The Hangry mode version of this Hamster-esque Two-Sided species Pokémon makes an appearance as a Secret Rare card in the Ancient Roar series of Pokémon TCG. This outstandingly illustrated card features a Hangry Morpeko atop a mountain of delicious-looking and brightly colored sugary snacks. The sheer detail concealed within the background of this card makes it undoubtedly one of the coolest looking Pokémon TCG cards to be released in a while - an opinion furthered by the obnoxiously cute Hangry Morpeko with its tiny arms full of tasty snacks.





 9  Wimpod (Gen 7) 
Ancient Roar Card 69/66
        

Although the seventh-generation Pokémon, Wimpod is somewhat visually reminiscent of a roach, this incredibly cowardly Water- and Bug-type Pokémon&#39;s Secret Rare card variant in the Ancient Roar series is incredibly cool. Depicting an infestation of Wimpods in a wooden in-door area (perhaps inside the hull of a ship), this card has an incredibly detailed and unique illustration that is presented in an art style that is far less cartoony than the vast majority of Pokémon TCG cards.





 8  Crustle (Gen 5) 
Ancient Roar Card 67/66


 







Featuring a cast of Crustles attempting to avoid the rain by huddling inside a cave, the Secret Rare variant of the Crustle card from the Ancient Roar series is a beautiful card with an exceptional grasp on the artistic principles of color. Dominated by the gray, brown, and green of the exterior of the cave, this card could have been excessively bland; however, the choice to go with these earthy tones allows the striking deep orange of the Crustle&#39;s body to pop in a way that makes this card brilliantly beautiful. Furthermore, the concept that a crustation-like Pokémon with a stone home attached to its back would feel the need to stay dry is very cute.

Paradox Pokémon have an obvious role in the video games, but how do they transfer into the Pokémon TCG? Here’s how Ancient and Future Pokémon work.









 7  Garbodor (Gen 5) 
Ancient Roar Card 65/66
        

An evolved state of one of the worst named Pokémon in franchise history, Trubbish is a Trash Heap Pokémon that is ordinarily fairly far from majestic; however, the Secret Rare card version presents this Poison-type Pokémon as proudly sitting atop a trash mountain. Though this card is likely set in a refuse center, it is oddly beautiful, with a pastel color palate dominated by various hues of light blue and pink. Beyond this, it is expertly illustrated - the enormous mountain of garbage is incredibly detailed with easily identifiable items discarded from homes, and the Trubbish itself is deceptively cute.





 6  Magby (Gen 2) 
Ancient Roar Card 68/66
        

Introduced in Gen-2, Magby is a Fire-type and the first evolutionary step in the lineage that eventually spawns Magmortar. This cute Pokémon is said to be found, in FireRed&#39;s Pokédex, in volcanic craters, and it is in this environment that Magby&#39;s latest Secret Rare Pokémon TCG card variant is shown to be relaxing. Appearing to be enjoying a dip in a pool of Lava, the Ancient Roar series version of Magby is simply super cute, and, as a result, this is likely a card that will capture the attention of collectors everywhere. Beyond this, the card itself features incredible artwork that is very reminiscent of the earliest Pokémon TCG cards.

 5  Armarouge Ex (Gen 9) 
Ancient Roar Card 79/66
        

Introduced in the ninth generation as a Pokémon Scarlet exclusive and the counterpart to Ceruledge, Armarouge is a Fire- and Psychic-type Pokémon that is said to be wearing a set of armor that once belonged to a distinguished warrior. The Secret Rare version of Armarouge is incredibly cool; it features the Pokémon in all its glory in front of a background of flames. Although not nearly as intricate as some of the other Secret Rare cards from the Ancient Roar series, this card is still super cool and one that many will want to get their hands on as soon as possible.





 4  Loudred (Gen 3) 
Ancient Roar Card 78/66
        

It seems incredibly appropriate that such a notoriously loud Pokémon should have a Secret Rare card with such an incredibly loud design. This brightly colored card has a design that evokes an anime-esque art style. Featuring Loudred with arms akimbo and mouth extended, the real charm of this card comes with the plethora of brightly colored comic book-style lighting bolts, lines, and clouds that are emanating from the enormous mouth of this big voice species Pokémon - it is undoubtedly one of the most uniquely designed cards to come from the newly released Ancient Roar series of Pokémon TCG cards.





 3  Veluza (Gen 9) 
Ancient Roar Card 70/66

        

Quite possibly the most beautiful card to come from the Ancient Roar series, the Secret Rare Veluza card is a masterclass in design, lighting, and color. The card features one prominent Veluza in the top right, with a school of Veluzas below. Beyond this, the card features an underwater scene with a ton of brightly colored coral and a fleeing Staryu, all of which are elevated by the card&#39;s outstandingly illustrated underwater light. Though the Secret Rare Veluza is far from the most powerful card in the Ancient Roar series, it is very eye-catching and likely one that fans of the Pokémon TCG will want to have in their collections.





 2  Golisopod Ex (Gen 7) 
Ancient Roar Card 81/66


 







The evolved state of Wimpod, Golisopod, is a far more intimidating Bug- and Water-type Pokémon than its earlier incarnation; likewise, its Ancient Roar Secret Rare card is exponentially more terrifying. Set in a desolate wooden room (similar to Wimpod), the Golisopod ex Secret Rare card features an incredibly atmospheric illustration and color palate. A monolithic Golisopod dominates the card, and towers over anything else in the room - appearing to have smashed through the ceiling, this Hard Scale Pokémon is intricately designed and appears in such a way as to exemplify the threat that it could pose. Beyond cool art, this is one of the strongest cards in the card set.





 1  Roaring Moon Ex (Gen 9) 
Ancient Roar Card 84/66


 







Roaring Moon is an incredibly powerful Pokémon that was introduced in Generation 9. This Dragon- and Dark-type, Paradox species Pokémon is visually incredibly reminiscent of Salamence, but with enormous and imposing wings. The Ancient Roar Secret Rare variant of this Pokémon masterfully captures its overwhelmingly powerful essence. Featuring an enraged-looking Roaring Moon in mid-flight in front of a background that appears to be a sort of vortex made of colored light, the Ancient Roar Roaring Moon ex Secret Rare Pokémon card is undoubtedly one card that most fans, players, and collectors of the Pokémon TCG will want to obtain ASAP.
