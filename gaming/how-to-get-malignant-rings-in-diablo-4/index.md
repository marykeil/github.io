## Literature Review

For those hoping to boost their stats, the Malignant Rings in Diablo 4 are a good way to make your character build even more OP than before.





The Malignant Rings are powerful tools in Diablo 4&#39;s Season 2 that can boost different class builds. Other Legendary Aspects might be more useful for other players who have different builds, but the Malignant Rings are a useful item for those who are already taking advantage of the Caged Malignant Hearts. There is only one way to find the rings in Diablo 4, which are unique to Season 2.




                  Every Major Change In Diablo 4 Season 2 from D4 Season 1   Season 2 of Diablo 4 brings more than just the Season of Blood, there are also numerous quality-of-life improvements happening for the entire game.

The only way to get Malignant Rings currently is to defeat the Echo of Varshan in this endgame boss fight of Season 2. All five Malignant Rings can drop from this boss fight, which is located in the Level 75 Malignant Burrow dungeon. It is available at World Tier III and World Tier IV, although players will need an extra ingredient if they are at the higher tier. Players will also need one of each of the following items to summon Varshan:

  Gurgling Head   Blackened Femur   Trembling Hand   Malignant Heart (for those playing on World Tier IV only)  






These Malignant Hearts are collected from Whisper caches and are not the same as the Caged Malignant Hearts in Season 1 that were previously dropped.




Defeat the Echo of Varshan, and it can drop a few unique items, five of which include the Malignant Rings available for each class. The table lists which of the Malignant Rings are possible to collect for each class and which Caged Heart they correspond to and are based on:

 Class  Malignant Ring  Caged Heart   Barbarian  Ring of Red Furor  Caged Heart of Focused Rage   Druid  Airidah&#39;s Inexorable Will  Caged Heart of Inexorable Force   Necromancer  Ring of Sacrilegious Soul  Caged Heart of the Sacrilegious   Rogue  Writhing Band of Trickery  Caged Heart of Trickery   Sorcerer  Tal Rasha&#39;s Iridescent Loop  Caged Heart of Tal&#39;Rasha   



All of these include a slight change or improvement to the original Caged Heart they are based on. Players will have to decide for themselves whether it suits their character build in Diablo 4, but some of them could be well worth it. Whether they keep it will be up to them once they have acquired each Malignant Ring and tested them in glorious battle.
