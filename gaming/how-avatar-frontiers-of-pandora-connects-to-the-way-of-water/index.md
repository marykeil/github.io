## Literature Review

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora tells its own unique story, but will be canon to the movies, taking place around the same time as The Way of Water.






Massive Entertainment&#39;s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora tells its own unique story about a Na&#39;vi warrior, but is set in the world of James Cameron&#39;s hugely successful Avatar movie franchise. When not adjusted for inflation, the Avatar movies are some of the highest-grossing movies of all time, with the first Avatar recently reclaiming the top spot from Avengers Endgame after some cinematic re-releases. Its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water broke records upon its theatrical release in 2022 and also went on to be the third highest-grossing movie of all time, overtaking Cameron&#39;s 1997 movie, Titanic.




The Avatar movies have focused on the paralyzed former Marine, Jake Sully, who becomes mobile again through a body that&#39;s a hybrid of humans and the alien Na&#39;vi, called Avatars. While using his avatar to explore the planet Pandora safely, Sully integrates himself with a Na&#39;vi tribe and falls for Neytiri, opting to defend Pandora from the human-led RDA (Resource Development Administration) who seek to plunder the planet for its resources. Avatar: The Way of Water picks up fifteen years later with Jake and Neytiri seeking refuge for themselves and their family with the aquatic Metkayina clan.

                  &#34;A Staggering Sensory Experience&#34; - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.   


 Frontiers Of Pandora Is Canon To The Avatar Movies

Massive Entertainment created Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in collaboration with Disney and James Cameron’s production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. Speaking at the June 2023 Ubisoft Forward event, Avatar&#39;s creator, James Cameron stated that the game will &#34;co-exist&#34; with and be canon to the Avatar movies.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora isn&#39;t Ubisoft&#39;s first canon game in the Avatar universe, as the company released a tie-in game for the 2009 movie that served as a prequel and saw players taking control of either a member of the Na&#39;vi or the RDA, with different gameplay and weapons depending on what they chose. Despite telling two different stories depending on the side of the conflict that players followed, this title was far more linear and didn&#39;t offer the open-world exploration of Pandora that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora does.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s story begins prior to the events of the Avatar movies, as the RDA abducts an indigenous Na&#39;vi child with the intent of training them with their futuristic military tech to become an asset to the organization. When the RDA&#39;s plans were disrupted by the Battle of the Hallelujah Mountains during the first Avatar movie, this Na&#39;vi was placed into an emergency cryosleep for 15 years.




The majority of the game&#39;s campaign takes place around the same time as Avatar: The Way of Water, with the player assuming control of this Na&#39;vi as they awaken, finding themselves a stranger on their home planet. Throughout the rest of the story, players follow the Na&#39;vi on their journey as they begin reintegrating with various Na&#39;vi clans and working to heal Pandora after years of environmental damage done by the RDA, combining the traditional skills they are learning from the Na&#39;vi with the tech-based knowledge from the RDA to do so.

                  Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora - Story, Gameplay &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s everything we know so far about the release date, price, story, and gameplay for Ubisoft&#39;s open-world game, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.   



 Frontiers Of Pandora Takes Place In A Different Area 
The Game&#39;s Narrative Won&#39;t Collide With The Movies&#39;
         




Despite being set at the same time as Avatar: The Way of Water, the story of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora will not overlap, wisely allowing Massive Entertainment and Lightstorm Entertainment to tell a unique story within the Avatar universe that is canon without being too beholden to the movies that came before it. This is because the game takes place in a completely different part of Pandora.

Jake and Neytiri fend off a threat to their family led by Colonel Miles Quaritch on Pandora&#39;s reefs on the Eastern Sea. However, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s protagonist is on the other side of the planet on the fully-explorable Western Frontier, taking down enemy bases and their figurehead, the RDA&#39;s John Mercer to begin healing the planet&#39;s environment.



Quaritch was killed at the end of the first Avatar movie, but was brought back to life in a Na&#39;vi body, known as a &#34;Recombinant&#34;.









                  Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Season Pass - Story DLC &amp; Differences   There are several editions of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora available with varying content, and its season pass includes further story DLC missions.   



 The Way Of Water And Frontiers Of Pandora Have Some Parallels 
But Massive Wanted To Insure Its Story Was Different


In an interview with IGN, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora’s associate game director, Drew Rechner, stated the team wanted to ensure that the game&#39;s stories and themes, were different from those in the films but still &#34;felt familiar&#34;, reiterating that Massive Entertainment didn&#39;t want to feel like it was &#34;retelling a story that most of the world has seen.” This is evident through the parallels Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora shares with Avatar: The Way of Water, despite telling two very distinct types of stories.

Despite taking place so far apart geographically, both stories have threats that are personal to their protagonists. Quaritch directly targets the Sully family in Avatar: The Way of Water, kidnapping their children and getting Spider - who is actually Quaritch&#39;s own son raised by the Sullys - to teach him the ways of the Na&#39;vi to better plan his attacks against the Sullys and the Metkayina clan. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s protagonist has some parallels to Quaritch, but has to learn the ways of the Na&#39;vi for heroic means as she comes face to face with the damage done by those who raised her, and tries to undo this while confronting the man who abducted her as a child.




This decision to keep the two stories apart was ultimately a wise one from a business perspective, ensuring that no part of the blockbuster franchise&#39;s audience is alienated. While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is still canon to the larger franchise, the option to set it apart from the events of the films made it so that fans of the films who aren&#39;t gamers can continue to watch them without the feeling that they are missing out on parts of the story, while Avatar fans who are also gamers can dive further into the world of Pandora and better explore its worldbuilding - which was built through Massive&#39;s collaboration with those making the movies to ensure everything is aligned - through the Na&#39;vi culture and the game&#39;s rich environments.
