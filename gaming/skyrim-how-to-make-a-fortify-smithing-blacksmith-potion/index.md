## Literature Review

In Skyrim, Fortify Smithing potions require special ingredients, and they can boost armor and weapons while crafting, in addition to other effects.





You can craft your own Fortify Smithing potion by gathering the required ingredients. If you have increased your alchemy skill in Skyrim, you will reap an additional boost when consuming the potion. To get started with the potion, you must gather the ingredients to create the potion in the first place.




                  The 20 Most Powerful Weapons In Skyrim (&amp; How To Find Them)   The Dragonborn is offered countless options to defend themselves with, but Skyrim&#39;s best weapons make it the easiest to deliver the killing blow.   


 All Fortify Smithing Potion Ingredients 
          

You will need to gather four main ingredients to create the Fortify Smithing potion. Many of these ingredients can either be purchased from alchemist vendors, stolen from other alchemists, or gathered from the wild. Here are the four ingredients you will need to acquire to craft the Fortify Smithing potion in Skyrim. 

  Blisterwort   Glowing Mushroom   Sabre Cat Tooth   Spriggan Sap.  

You can find the Blisterwort in most caves around Skyrim&#39;s open world, including in caves such as Halldir&#39;s Cair, Blackreach, and Chillwind Depths. The Glowing Mushroom can be found in limited locations. However, the best place to find them is in Tovald&#39;s Cave, in the basement of Honninbrew Meadery, near the exit for Bleak Falls Barrow, and in the Dwemer ruins.

To obtain the Sabre Cat Tooth, you will need to fight the beast and remove a tooth from its mouth. You will find the cats in the wild around Skyrim&#39;s Whiterun and Winterhold areas. There is also a notable number in Greenspring Hollow in Whiterun Hold.



The Sabre Cat Tooth ingredient for Skyrim&#39;s Fortify Smithing Potions can also be obtained from Vale Sabre Cats!




The final ingredient for Fortify Smithing potions, Spriggan Sap, can easily be acquired from alchemy shops. There are only a few in the world located throughout the College of Winterhold, in the Hall of Countenance, and in the Arch-Mage&#39;s quarters.



 Skyrim&#39;s Fortify Smithing Potion Recipes 
          




To create better Fortify Smithing potions in Skyrim, you will need to increase your alchemy skills. The best way to improve this skill is to make potions in bulk or purchase training sessions from relevant NPCs. Additionally, the Bosmer, Breton, Khajiit, and Dunmer race bonuses include a boost to alchemy. Once you have sufficient alchemy skills and the required ingredients, you will need to properly combine your materials to create the potion with the desired effect.

Combining Blisterwort and Glowing Mushroom will produce a Fortify Smithing potion, and if you add a Giant&#39;s Toe to the concoction, you will get the additional benefits of Damage Stamina and Fortify Health. Using the extra ingredient will increase the value of the potion and the alchemy skill level increase you receive.



Blisterwort and Sabre Cat Tooth mixed with a Sabre Cat Eyeball produces a potion of Fortify Smithing, Restore Health, and Restore Stamina, which is ideal for improving the Dragonborn&#39;s armor after a fight.







Spriggan Sap alone has the Fortify Enchanting effect, so combining it with Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, or a Sabre Cat Tooth will produce a Fortify Smithing potion that works best when combined with another Enchanting ingredient, such as Snowberries. For instance, Spriggan Sap, Glowing Mushroom, and Snowberries are mixed together to produce a potion of Fortify Smithing, Fortify Enchanting, and Resist Shock.

Blisterwort also adds Frenzy to a potion when used as an ingredient. Accordingly, a combination such as Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, and a Boar Tusk will produce a potion of Frenzy, Fortify Smithing, and Fortify Health. You may not always need to use these most powerful Fortify Smithing potions, especially if you are crafting them in bulk to increase the alchemy level, but many of these will sell for high prices and help earn a significant amount of gold in Skyrim.
