## Literature Review

Sony has revealed new games available through PlayStation Plus for November 2023, with a few key options available for all subscribers.




Sony has officially revealed the lineup of PlayStation Plus games for November 2023, showing subscribers just what they&#39;ll be able to access in the coming weeks. Each month adds three games available across all tiers of the service, although this always means the prior rotation will no longer be downloadable once the window switches over. The October 2023 games were The Callisto Protocol, Farming Simulator 22, and Weird West, all of which need to be added to a user&#39;s library by November 6 in order to keep them accessible in the future.




PlayStation Plus is divided into three tiers - Essential, Extra, and Premium. Each of these delivers the basic online services that the subscription promises and brings the core system of rotating games with it, and each recently received a price increase with a set of changes implemented in September. Extra and Premium offer access to an expanded library of titles that receive monthly additions without the limited time window, representing an ever-growing list of options. The selection represented by these upgraded subscriptions is impressive, but the standard monthly games still tend to pack in a solid variety.

                  How Much Every Tier Of PlayStation Plus Costs After PS Plus Price Increase   PlayStation Plus has substantially increased the costs of its video game subscription service, here is the new pricing structure and what it means.

The reveal of the three games that will be available across all tiers of PlayStation Plus in November was made on the official PlayStation Blog, accompanied by some updates on the Sony Pictures Core service that recently launched for movie streaming on PS4 and PS5. Mafia 2: Definitive Edition, Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and Aliens: Fireteam Elite comprise the November lineup. All three of these games will be accessible on November 7 and can be added to the library for permanent use (with an active subscription) until they depart to make way for another batch on December 4. Another PlayStation Blog post revealed which games will be added to the Extra and Premium lineups in November 2023.

                  Sony&#39;s New Movies Feature Somehow Makes PS Plus Worse   Following a major price increase, the Sony Pictures Core app offers free movies for PS Plus Premium subscribers, but it needed more QA before launch.    



 November 2023 PS Plus Games Cover Several Genres 
          

The highlighted spot in the banner announcing the free November PlayStation Plus games goes to Mafia 2: Definitive Edition, a remastered version of a classic crime game. Although many forays into Grand Theft Auto&#39;s genre have been doomed to live in its shadow, Mafia 2 has always had a strong following thanks to its engaging story and gameplay. This is the main choice for those principally interested in a single-player experience this month, and there&#39;s no real need to play the first Mafia game (previously available in the February 2023 PlayStation Plus lineup) before jumping in.




Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers an asymmetrical online experience that pits citizens against major Dragon Ball villains, focusing on large-scale havoc rather than tapping into the horror elements that many asymmetrical games lean into. The survival shooter Aliens: Fireteam Elite focuses on co-op against standard AI enemies instead, flinging Xenomorph hordes at players to force careful equipment and leveling decisions. Between these three very different experiences, there&#39;s likely something that can entertain anyone committing to a PlayStation Plus subscription for November 2023.
