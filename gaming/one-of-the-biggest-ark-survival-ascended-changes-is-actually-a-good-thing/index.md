# One Of The Biggest Ark Survival Ascended Changes Is Actually A Good Thing


## SUMMARY 



  Changes to Cryopods in ARK: Survival Ascended have been made for balance, preventing them from being overpowered like in Survival Evolved.   These changes require survivors to come up with new strategies when fighting beasts or other tribes, as old tactics involving Cryopods and movement speed are no longer effective.   While the changes to Cryopods and movement speed may be unpopular with some players, they are necessary for balancing the game and keeping it interesting in the long run.

## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended might be a remake of Survival Evolved, but itâ€™s making changes from the original, and that seems to be an improvement here.




ARK: Survival Ascended is a remake of ARK: Survival Evolved, but it hasn&#39;t been afraid to make changes where they&#39;ve been needed. A lot of the changes that have been made are for the sake of balance, helping to prevent items from being as overpowered as they were in Survival Evolved, and therefore forcing survivors to come up with new strategies when fighting beasts or other tribes. However, even changes that seem small end up having big effects regarding how the game is played and what strategies work the best.




Considering that ARK: Survival Ascended is still in Early Access, there&#39;s time for more changes to be made to continue balancing the game and finding ways to keep the essence of Survival Evolved while making it feel new and interesting at the same time. However, some changes that have been made are unlikely to be reversed, especially since their original design made them far too powerful in Survival Evolved. One of the biggest examples of this is Cryopods and how a small adjustment to them means that survivors will need to find new strategies when attacking another tribe.


 Changes To Cryopods In ARK: Survival Ascended 
         

In Survival Evolved, Cryopods could be used to store dinosaurs like items, letting survivors haul them across the map to attack another base with relative ease. They also made breeding dinosaurs easier, since survivors could have different species stored and ready to be used to create new super dinosaurs at any time. However, Cryopods have been added to ASA in a recent update with several changes in how they function. They&#39;re subject to more change, though, along with any other upcoming ARK: Survival Ascended features, since the game is in Early Access and still in active development.




In Survival Ascended, Cryopods require a powered Cryofridge to work, which was also true in Survival Evolved, but the changes made to the Cryofridge in Survival Ascended also affect Cryopods, since they&#39;re required for the latter to function. After being placed, Cryofridges take five minutes to activate, and Cryopods can only be released when they&#39;re in the range of an activated and powered Cryofridge. In PvP, a Cryopod can&#39;t be released with enemies within a range of 3,500. If a dinosaur has been damaged within 60 seconds, then it can&#39;t be put in a Cryopod.

Then, there are a few changes to how Cryopods are crafted and stored in Survival Ascended as well. Cryopods used to be limited to one at a time for crafting them in a supply drop or obelisk, but now they can be queued up to make the crafting process easier for survivors. Storage for dinosaurs is also easier for survivors thanks to changes made to Cryofridges as well. The maximum capacity for Cryofridges has been increased to 120 slots. And Cryopodded dinosaurs can be stored in a Display Case structure, adding even more storage capacity for them. So, while some changes that have been made are being criticized for the difficulties they add, other changes bring improvements in small ways.




                  10 Coolest Ark: Survival Ascended Dinosaurs, Ranked   There are so many dinos to choose from in Ark: Survival Ascended that figuring out which ones to tame can actually be pretty difficult.    



 How Cryopods Change Strategies 
          

With the way that Cryopods could be used in Survival Evolved, survivors would store dinosaurs to move them across large distances easily, especially with builds that maxed out movement speed. Now, however, those features have been adjusted, outright removed, or haven&#39;t been added to the game yet. The ARK: Survival Ascended roadmap shows what the future holds for official content, but with the developers watching how the current features function, there could be more adjustments made to items like Cryopods or features like movement speed. Until then, key strategies from Survival Evolved are unavailable for survivors to use, which is perhaps the answer to keeping the game interesting.




Attacking other tribes or beasts, especially in PvP, now requires more strategies, because survivors can&#39;t stack movement speed anymore, and they can&#39;t combine that with carrying dinosaurs in Cryopods. Previously, players would unleash carried, Cryopodded dinosaurs at an enemy location and overwhelm them without giving them time to prepare a defense. But now, survivors will have to find new strategies, and have the time required to enact them, since even with Cryopods, it&#39;ll take longer to reach enemy locations without stacking movement speed. This means that enemies will have the chance to see an attack coming earlier and begin preparing, evening the playing field a bit more.



 The Future Of Cryopods In ARK: Survival Ascended 
          

Right now, it&#39;s hard to say with certainty if Cryopods will stay as they are now, return to the way they used to be in Survival Evolved, or receive more changes and become even more different from their original version. As it is, Cryopods are far less overpowered than they used to be, which is a positive. But the increased amount of time it takes to travel with dinosaurs and deploy them to fight can be a disappointing change for other survivors, especially if they relied on the old strategies of Survival Evolved for success.




For the moment, the changes to Cryopods and movement speed make the game more interesting because it provides a greater warning when a base is being attacked and forces survivors to use varying strategies and skills instead of relying on the same ones. Reverting the changes and going back to the old version of Cryopods would mean that they&#39;re overpowered again, and that can make the game feel stale after the first few times. In the end, it&#39;s a difficult feature to balance because it&#39;s so useful, but it&#39;s also so easy to make it overpowered.

For the time being, ARK: Survival Ascended is in Early Access, and that means that anything can change between now and full release. The DLC content that came out for Survival Evolved hasn&#39;t yet been added either, which can bring with it additional changes to how the game works and which items will end up overpowered, if any. However, as unpopular as the Cryopod changes might be among some survivors, they were needed for the sake of balance, and there&#39;s potential for them to be changed even further moving forward in ARK: Survival Ascended.
