The November 12th Wordle answer is MEANT.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which covers a good section of vowels and some of the popular consonants. This helped out quite a bit today as we got one correctly placed &#39;A&#39; and two other letters &#39;E&#39; and &#39;T&#39; in the wrong positions. Shuffling around a bit we tried TEALS which locked in the &#39;E&#39; and pretty much provided the correct location for &#39;T&#39; since there was no other possible spot for it to go.

Moving forward we tried REACT, which in retrospect was bound to be incorrect since we already learned about the &#39;R&#39; in our first guess, but it did lock in the &#39;T&#39; and move us into our final answer. Finally, we scored our Wordle win-in-four with the right answer, MEANT.
