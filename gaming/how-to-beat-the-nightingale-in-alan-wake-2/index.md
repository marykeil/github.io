## Literature Review

Robert Nightingale is the first boss fight of Alan Wake 2. It serves as Saga’s initial major threat and a form of gameplay tutorial.





Nightingale mainly shows up during “Return,” which are Saga Anderson’s story chapters in the real world. His boss fight serves as the first major challenge and a form of tutorial on Saga’s gameplay. Several prompts and in-game hints will appear by default.

Nightingale will first show up in Alan Wake 2 while wandering through the dark woods of Cauldron Lake. Alan Wake will whisper information through his manuscript about Robert Nightingale and provide subtle clues. For the initial ambush, Nightingale prefers to wield a large tree branch and charge in. You need to first aim Saga’s equipped flashlight directly at Nightingale to expose his “Source” weak points.



Source points are the key targets of many other bosses. Hitting these deals extra damage and can sometimes stun the foe. This makes them even better than aiming for specific body parts or springing environmental traps.




Destroy Nightingale’s entire Source, then switch to mainly doing headshots. For defenses, be mindful of the branch he holds and stay a good distance away. Also, utilize the dodge roll button to get away quickly if he does swing.

After taking enough damage, Robert will flee. This gives you time to breathe and get a better understanding of the surroundings. Ammo﻿, flashlight batteries, and healing items may randomly spawn. Once ready, head towards the red light shining in the tunnel to reach the full boss fight zone.

He fights similarly to the first ambush but has no more Source to exploit. Instead, always aim Saga’s handgun, one of the best weapons in Alan Wake 2, at his head for maximum damage. Even without Source, using the flashlight can still make Nightingale a little vulnerable by removing his shadow-like protection. After significant damage, Robert will retreat, and new items will appear. Collect these and get ready for him to re-spawn around the arena. Defeat him three times in this manner, and he will finally perish for good.




At this point, Alan will arrive in Saga’s Mind Place. The two will talk briefly, and then you can start Alan’s story of “Initiation.” His gameplay is a lot more puzzle-orientated, with a little less gunplay and action compared to Saga. After completing the prologues of both Return and Initiation, you will be free to play Alan Wake 2 in the order of your choosing. If you want to have more boss battles like Nightingale, stick to mostly playing Saga first.
