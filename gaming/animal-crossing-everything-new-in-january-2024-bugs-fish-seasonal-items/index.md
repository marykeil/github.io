## Literature Review

2024 gets off to a slow start in Animal Crossing New Horizons, with a laidback January featuring some new critters to catch and a few small events.





December in Animal Crossing New Horizons features big events, including Toy Day and New Year’s Eve, essentially back-to-back. In contrast, January features very little in the way of new events. A new rotation of new bugs, fish, and deep-sea creatures is available for critter collectors in the Southern Hemisphere. However, critter collectors in the Northern Hemisphere don’t have anything new to catch.

 January Events And Seasonal Items 
          

January doesn’t feature any major events or festivals, but players in both hemispheres can enjoy critter catching tournaments. C.J.’s Fishing Tourney returns on January 14 in both hemispheres, and Southern Hemisphere islanders can also take part in Flick’s Bug-Off event on January 21.




During the Fishing Tourney, players can join a fishing tournament where the goal is to catch as many fish as possible within three minutes. This earns points, which can be exchanged with C.J. for fish-themed prizes and trophies. You can try the tournament as many times as you like between 9AM and 6PM, but only the first competition is free, with subsequent entries costing 500 Bells each. Sadly, the Fishing Tourney needs better prizes, but if you’re an aspiring angler, then it’s a fun test of your skills.

          

Flick’s Bug-Off event works in the same way, except players must catch bugs instead of fish. Unfortunately, islanders in the Northern Hemisphere won’t be able to take part in a Bug-Off until June, which is a long time away.

January 2024 is set to be a rather quiet month in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. However, this also gives players the chance to focus on other activities, such as purchasing art from the shady art dealer Redd, and sculpting and terraforming their islands in preparation for a much busier February.
