Easy Category: Customized Gaming Accessories
For those looking for an easy yet thoughtful gift, Vega recommends customized accessories like button caps for 

gaming controllers and console skins
. These small additions can personalize a gaming experience.




Add some equipment in there, [and] you can add buttons on your controllers. I have a little Sailor Moon Luna one.




          




Medium Category: Essential Gaming Gear
Moving up to medium-level gifting, Vega suggests 

high-quality gaming headphones
 and large mousepads, essential for any gamer&#39;s setup.




For anybody who is a streamer, online gamer, or PC gamer. I even attached my PlayStation to my computer so I can play that way too. But these things are so essential.




          

Hard Category: Customized Gaming Systems
For a more extravagant gift, Vega recommends a 

customized gaming PC
, tailored to the recipient&#39;s favorite themes and characters.




There&#39;s hard and then there&#39;s expert level. Expert level would probably be what my husband got me last Christmas; it was a PC. He got me a whole customized PC exactly how I&#39;d want it.




          




Casual Gaming: Just to Have Fun
Lastly, Vega ends with gifts that work with all gamers: 

actual games
.




I would say any kind of games, like Street Fighter 6, that they might like; things that they can deep dive into. I love The Sims. It&#39;s like my guilty pleasure. So bad. But stuff like that. Getting them something like a PlayStation, getting them an Xbox. Steamdecks are great. That&#39;s great on the road for us, [or] a Nintendo Switch or anything like that.
