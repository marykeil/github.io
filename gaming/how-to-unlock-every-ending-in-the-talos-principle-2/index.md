## Literature Review

There are three ending epilogues you can unlock in The Talos Principle 2, each leading to cutscenes that reflect a choice and its consequences.





[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for The Talos Principle 2.]




You must solve the final puzzle at the Megastructure to find Athena, the robot connected to a nightmarish loop through the Machine. You could miss other sections, including the LOST and Golden puzzles found at various points in the game. As of this time of writing, these harder puzzles in The Talos Principle 2 do not tie into a secret ending or new choice when you complete them all and only serve as an extra challenge.

                  &#34;Not Just Another Puzzle Game&#34;: The Talos Principle 2 Preview   Talos Principle II appears to be a strong follow-up to its predecessor, but there are still several aspects that require some refining before release.   


 The &#34;Chicken&#34; Ending 
          

The &#34;Chicken&#34; ending is the only hidden resolution in The Talos Principle 2 and can be unlocked by refusing to join the Expedition at the beginning of the game. This takes place after the Training tutorial, which teaches basic systems you will use for all the puzzles your character encounters. When asked to travel with others into the city, simply say &#34;Sorry, not interested&#34; to play the credits in a fast scroll.




This is the only lighthearted conclusion to your story, as the others have far deeper meanings tied to the themes of The Talos Principle 2. Thankfully, you are rewarded for this ending with the &#34;Chicken&#34; achievement/trophy that would ordinarily be missed. Those looking to 100% complete all aspects of the game will want to reach this ending before restarting their adventure with a new save file.



 Leap of Faith 
          

The first epilogue for The Talos Principle 2 can be unlocked when you pick the &#34;I want to know the truth&#34; dialogue option when talking to Athena. A title card will display the name of the ending, where 1k frees Athena from the Machine before taking their place in the strange device. Athena reflects on how strong this choice was before the character Prometheus gives a touching speech about how you will endure.




Many of the structures you have visited along your journey dissolve into purple dust as Prometheus also fades, leaving you to witness the hidden truths of the universe. A mesmerizing series of images plays as 1k is connected to the Machine, showcasing the &#34;truth&#34; you wanted to see. From this point, 1k arrives in a barren realm devoid of life until they create a tree out of thin air with what seem to be new powers.

A character named Byron speaks as 1k discovers their new powers, leaving you with a sense that a new world might be created in the robot&#39;s image. Whether that outcome is good or bad is for you to decide, like all the endings to The Talos Principle 2. Some may consider this the &#34;normal&#34; ending if you did not form meaningful relationships with others to open up another dialogue path with Athena.



 Momentum Deferred 
          




The Momentum Deferred ending comes by picking the second dialogue option when talking to Athena in the Machine instead of the first. This option reads, &#34;I had hoped we could use this technology safely, but we&#39;re not ready. Shut it down.&#34; This will cause Athena to be freed once again, but this time, 1k turns off the Machine entirely when entering the device, to the anger of many you&#39;ve met along your journey.

In the following cutscene, Athena remarks on how the real world does not have prophets who would sacrifice themselves and understand your choice somewhat. The Sphinx will speak as the Machine shuts down, commending your wisdom in picking a choice without a choice or an ending without a real ending. Many would consider this a &#34;neutral&#34; ending to The Talos Principle 2, but it is more complex than that.



Many characters in The Talos Principle 2 have extra epilogue cutscenes in each ending, depending on how you interacted with them during the main story.







After the Machine powers down completely, you will see the citizens of New Jerusalem in turmoil as they argue about the best course of action in strange and unfamiliar times. 1k silently leaves the crowd, heading into the woods to find Athena sitting on a bench overlooking the city. Athena leaves a last remark about building a future together without relying on the power of a force like the Machine.​​​​​​​



 Certain Fathoms in the Earth 
          

The final ending to The Talos Principle 2 is Certain Fathoms in the Earth, unlocked by picking the third dialogue option with Athena. Choose the &#34;I&#39;ve changed my mind. The risk is too great. We must destroy the Machine.&#34; prompt to initiate an epilogue again. 1k takes over for Athena here, but this time destroys every aspect of the Machine instead of ascending with it in the Leap of Faith ending.




The character Pandora remarks on how the metaphorical &#34;Flame&#34; left by the godlike beings may be gone, but people still endure. The resulting choice from this feels very human as 1k chooses to eliminate something beyond understanding that could have harmed everyone they knew. Like the Momentum Deferred ending, you wind up back in New Jerusalem, this time listening to Hermanubis defend their stance on destroying the Machine.

Hermanubus tries to deflect blame onto them in place of 1k, claiming that this decision sets a new course for the city and that they won&#39;t apologize for their choice. This &#34;bad&#34; ending has a silver lining about preserving the planet&#39;s nature and not letting the power of the Machine alter it. The final shot shows 1k walking in the woods and stumbling across an elk, which the robot bows to as the screen fades to black.

When you unlock every ending in The Talos Principle 2, you will earn an achievement for each and should be able to load a save right before meeting Athena to easily the other paths.
