The booster packs are from the Temporal Forces set, but the contents vary from within the available cards in that set. Preparing Trainers for playing a game with the new cards, the sets also include six damage-counter dice, a competition-legal coin flip die, and two plastic condition markers that can be helpful for keeping track of elements in a game.

 Ordering From The Pokémon Center Gives Exclusive Extras 
Generally At A Higher Price Point
          

Currently, the Temporal Forces Elite Trainer Boxes are only available for preorder from The Pokémon Center, with an MSRP of $59.99. Purchasing from The Pokémon Center includes bonus items that are not found in Elite Trainer Boxes anywhere else. Typically, the price of buying an ETB elsewhere is a bit cheaper though, usually $49.99, to offset not having the extra items.

  11 Pokémon TCG: Temporal Forces booster packs rather than 9   1 full-art foil promo card featuring either Flutter Mane or Iron Thorns with a Pokémon Center logo on it  This is in addition to the full-art promo card already included in the Elite Trainer Box.     




The exclusive promo card and additional booster packs can be tempting, and add extra value as well as cost to the Elite Trainer Box, but there are other places to purchase non-exclusive Elite Trainer Boxes as well.



 Where To Preorder Temporal Forces Elite Trainer Boxes 
Available For Preorder Now
          

At the time of writing, the only place to preorder the Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Temporal Forces Elite Trainer Boxes is through The Pokémon Center, although some local game stores may be beginning to gather preorder information. It is always worth checking with a local game store to see what they are expecting to get in stock, and when they will accept pre-orders. Otherwise, when Temporal Forces is released on March 22, 2024, the Elite Trainer Boxes are expected to be available wherever Pokémon TCG products are sold.




Every new expansion set is an exciting prospect, and this Temporal Forces set will be of particular note to those who have been playing the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet video games with an emphasis on Ancient and Future Pokémon and the Paradox dynamic.
