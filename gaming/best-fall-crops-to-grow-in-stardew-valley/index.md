## Literature Review

Fall in one season in Stardew Valley that players will want to maximize their profit. Some of the best crops can be grown this time of year.





You can grow a total of 14 different crops in Fall, and it&#39;s important that you start planning out your Fall season before Summer ends. Some of the best crops for the season are highly profitable but take weeks to grow. Having a plan means that you&#39;ll avoid wasting gold on seeds that won&#39;t grow in time before Winter rolls around. Finally, make sure to prep your farm with fertilizer. Its effects can be game-changing, but it&#39;s also easy to forget to use it.









 








 10  Corn 
A Reliable Multi-Season Staple Crop
        

  Growth Time   14 days for first harvest, produces harvestable Corn every 4 days after    Seed Cost   150g    Base Sell Price   50g    Gold per Day   7.41g (if grown in Summer)    
Getting value out of Corn can be tricky, as the humble cereal crop isn&#39;t particularly profitable. However, it&#39;s one of the few crops that can be grown across two seasons and can be harvested multiple times. Multiple harvests across Summer and Fall allow you to turn a decent profit on this crop, even though it&#39;s not particularly stellar in terms of pure profit.
As a multi-season crop, Corn also won&#39;t die when Summer ends. Having a small patch of land dedicated to growing Corn means that you won&#39;t have to start replanting your whole farm from scratch at the start of Fall. You&#39;ll also have some crops to harvest and sell, giving you extra gold to spend on other Fall crop seeds.
Corn is also one of the best crops to include in Stardew Valley&#39;s Community Center bundles. You can fill a slot in the Fall Crops and Quality Crops Bundles with Corn, bringing you a few steps closer to completing the Community Center. 






 9  Fairy Rose 
An Excellent Choice For Aspiring Beekeepers


 







  Growth Time   12 days    Seed Cost   200g    Base Sell Price   290g    Gold per Day   7.5g    
Flowers are often loved gifts for Stardew Valley&#39;s twelve marriage candidates and other villagers, and fields of flowers can make your farm look rather picturesque. Unfortunately, they&#39;re not cheap to grow and don&#39;t sell for much. On paper, the Fairy Rose fits this description perfectly: high seed cost, low sell price and an average margin between the two.
Poppies are a great choice if you&#39;re romancing Penny, as they&#39;re one of her Loved gifts and will win you a lot of Friendship Points. Similarly, Sunflowers are one of Haley&#39;s Loved gifts. 

What makes the Fairy Rose shine is its utility for making Honey. By placing a Bee House within five squares of a Fairy Rose flower, you can produce Fairy Rose Honey. This sells for 680g a jar, a massive increase over the 100g sell price of basic Wild Honey. This is one of the best items to sell in Stardew Valley, assuming you&#39;ve collected the resources for crafting more than one Bee House.
Make sure to grab the Artisan Profession when your Farmer&#39;s Farming Skill hits Level 10. This adds an extra 40% to the sell price of Artisan Goods. 






 8  Artichoke 
A Hearty Vegetable Crop For Your Second Year
        

  Growth Time   8 days    Seed Cost   30g    Base Sell Price   160g    Gold per Day   16.25g    
In your second year in Pelican Town, you&#39;ll notice that a few extra types of seed can be purchased. This includes Artichokes, a simple vegetable crop that can be grown and harvested in eight days, and sells for 160g. There&#39;s a good balance here, as it doesn&#39;t take too long to grow and still sells for good value.
As such, you can use it as a staple cash crop, allowing you to regularly earn some gold while working on bigger farm projects.
Artichokes are fairly straightforward, and unlike the Fairy Rose, there aren&#39;t any hidden products that you can make with them. However, they&#39;re used as ingredients in the Artichoke Dip and Super Meal recipes: both great meals for restoring energy and health.
If your farm is set up with Preserves Jars, you can place Artichokes inside them to create Pickles, a valuable Artisan Good. Pickles sell for less than Wine, but only take a few days to process. 






 7  Eggplant 
A Steady Cash Crop With Multiple Harvest Potential
        

  Growth Time   5 days for first harvest, produces harvestable Eggplant every 5 days after.    Seed Cost   20g    Base Sell Price   60g    Gold per Day   11.2g    
Eggplants occupy a similar space to Artichokes, but are available from your first year in Stardew Valley and can be harvested multiple times. This allows you to make extra profit compared to single-harvest crops. There&#39;s also a fast growth period; you&#39;ll get your first harvest within 5 days of planting your Eggplant Seeds, and a fresh crop every 5 days after.
Aside from a low chance of producing multiple crops when harvested, the Eggplant also doesn&#39;t come with any surprises. It&#39;s a basic crop that benefits a lot from specific types of Fertilizer. Deluxe Speed-Gro can cut down the time between harvests, and Fertilizer increases your chances of receiving higher-quality produce.





 6  Amaranth 
An Easy-To-Harvest Grain For Animal Lovers
        

  Growth Time   7 days.    Seed Cost   70g    Base Sell Price   150g    Gold per Day   11.43g    
Amaranth is a basic grain crop with a single advantage: it&#39;s harvested with a Scythe rather than by hand. Because of this, it&#39;s far less time-intensive, and you can easily harvest and replant in half the time. It&#39;s a particularly good choice for after your first year in Pelican Town, when you&#39;ll need to dedicate more time to other activities such as fishing and mining.
You should also grow Amaranth in your first year, as Marnie the rancher will send you a letter on the 3rd day of Fall requesting some for her cows. Marnie sells some of the best animals in Stardew Valley and will also send you recipes, so it&#39;s well worth helping her out with some local produce from your farm.





 5  Beets 
A Root Vegetable With Many Different Uses


 







  Growth Time   6 days.    Seed Cost   20g (From Sandy&#39;s Oasis)    Base Sell Price   100g    Gold per Day   13.33g    
Beets have a decent profit margin when sold off, but have many other uses that make them worth growing in Fall. This includes turning them into Sugar, an essential ingredient in many of Stardew Valley&#39;s kitchen recipes. If you&#39;re planning on baking a sweet treat for one of Pelican Town&#39;s bachelors or bachelorettes, it&#39;s likely that you&#39;ll need to add some Sugar.
You can purchase Sugar from Pierre&#39;s or JojaMart, but it&#39;ll cost much more. 

To make Sugar, you&#39;ll need a Mill: a special farm building that&#39;s used for milling rice, and processing wheat and beets into Flour and Sugar respectively. Goods processed by the Mill appear the morning after, so it&#39;s easy just to drop a few stacks of Beets in and pick up your Sugar the next morning.





 4  Pumpkin 
A High-Value Fall Favorite
        

  Growth Time   13 days.    Seed Cost   100g    Base Sell Price   320g    Gold per Day   16.92g    
Pumpkins are one of Fall&#39;s most profitable crops, and they have one of the highest per-unit sell prices in the game. They&#39;re also heavily featured in the Community Center bundles, making them an essential crop for anyone hoping to restore Pelican Town to its former glory.
Like Cauliflowers and Melons, Pumpkins can grow into giant crops if planted in a 3x3 pattern. Giant crops drop up to 21 normal quality standard crops when harvested. 

Pumpkins also have a few other uses, including as part of a few cooking recipes such as Pumpkin Pie and Pumpkin Soup. Finally, in true Fall tradition, you can use them to craft Jack-O-Lanterns for the Halloween-themed Spirit&#39;s Eve Festival at the end of the season.





 3  Grapes 
An Essential Ingredient For Any Stardew Valley Winery


 







  Growth Time   10 days for first harvest, produces Grapes every 3 days after.    Seed Cost   60g    Base Sell Price   80g    Gold per Day   16.8g    
Grape Starters are a must-have for anyone hoping to produce Wine. Processing Grapes into Wine triples their base sell price from 80g to 240g. You can take this further by aging Grape Wine in Casks, increasing its quality and sales price. An Iridium-quality Grape Wine sells for 480g without the Artisan Profession: six times the original selling price.
The best way to make Grape Wine is to dedicate a lot of time and space to growing Grapes. Fall is the best season for this, as you can&#39;t grow most crops outside during Winter. As such, you can spend Winter indoors, producing high-quality Wine and earning profit to keep your farm going until Spring arrives. Certain Stardew Valley mods add custom farm maps, many of which have extra space for your Kegs and Casks.





 2  Cranberries 
An Essential High-Value Fall Cash Crop
        

  Growth Time   7 days for first harvest, produces Cranberries every 5 days after.    Seed Cost   240g    Base Sell Price   75g x 2    Gold per Day   18.89g    
Cranberries are a must-have for any successful Fall harvest, and produce a new crop every five days. Unfortunately, starting a Cranberry Farm requires a substantial initial investment, as Cranberry Seeds cost 240g each. However, once you&#39;re up and running, your Cranberry crops will quickly start earning you significant profits.
Each Cranberry crop is guaranteed to produce at least two Cranberries, with a chance to produce even more, allowing you to rapidly stockpile them to sell. Cranberries are among the most valuable crops in Stardew Valley with a gold per-day ratio that&#39;s unmatched for the Fall season, with one notable exception.





 1  Sweet Gem Berry 
The Best Crop In Stardew Valley
        

  Growth Time   24 Days.    Seed Cost   1,000g from the Traveling Cart    Base Sell Price   3,000g    Gold per Day   83.33g    
The Sweet Gem Berry is easily the best crop to grow in Stardew Valley during the Fall, and it&#39;s quite possibly the best crop in the game overall. It&#39;s extremely hard to grow, as you&#39;ll need to purchase Rare Seeds from the Traveling Cart, plant and then wait a staggering 24 days for your efforts to bear any fruit. You&#39;ll get only one harvest the whole season.
You can also only buy between 1-5 Rare Seeds at once, which severely limits growth. A Seed Maker can help by producing more seeds if you&#39;re willing to process the extremely high-value crop. However, starting a Sweet Gem Berry Farm is likely to be a multi-year project even for the most dedicated Stardew Valley farmers.
