## Literature Review

Team GO Leader Sierra returns for trainers to face in Pokémon GO with a new line-up for November 2023 and is tough to beat without the right Pokémon.





To be able to complete the new Special Research Task fully, you will need to beat Team GO Boss Giovanni this November, but this can only be done once you have beaten the three Team GO leaders including Sierra. Sierra&#39;s team has changed in recent months, but she will still use three out of seven Pokémon in battle.





 Sierra&#39;s Team For November 2023 in Pokémon GO 
         

For the new month, Sierra will now start with Dark- and Ghost-type Sableye, who was previously one of her second Pokémon. There are two new additions to her potential next option. Psychic- and Fairy-type Gardevoir returns, alongside Steel- and Flying-type Skarmory and Generation 1 Poison-type Muk.

Once you have passed Sierra&#39;s first two Pokémon she will again pick from three more for her final choice, all of which are tough to take down. This will be either Dark- and Fire-type Houndoom, Water- and Flying-type Gyarados, or Water- and Dragon-type Kingdra.

 Best Pokémon GO Counters For Sierra in November 2023 
          

Sierra&#39;s line-up in Pokémon GO can be tough for Trainers to take down, with her first Pokémon Sableye having few weaknesses. Only Fairy-types are strong against it, so using one such as Togekiss will give you a big advantage, it is also strong against Kingdra if it is selected as the Leader&#39;s final Pokémon.

Sierra&#39;s line-up is very varied and doesn&#39;t have lots of similar weaknesses, making her one of the hardest battles in Pokémon GO this November. Using a strong Electric type such as Raikou or Zapdos, can take care of Skarmory and Gyarados, but this can be swapped for a Ground-type Pokémon depending on if Sierra uses Muk.



For a final choice Rock- and Dark-type Tyranitar is a great option, it is super-effective against Houndoom and Gyarados, as well as being too strong for some of the Leader&#39;s other possibilities.







Sierras&#39; line-up in September 2023 is varied and can cause Trainers problems, but she can be defeated using the right counters in Pokémon GO.
