## Literature Review

Super Mario RPG Remake combines classic RPG stats with Mario platforming. It is best to approach it with a combined mindset.





While the earlier parts of the game are easy to complete, Super Mario RPG can escalate quickly. You’ll want to fully understand all the game mechanics when encountering the hardest possible bosses. Being familiar with common strategies will also make it more intuitive to discover secrets hidden around the world.









 








 7  Practice Timed Inputs 
        

Timing your button presses is key to maximizing damage and reducing incoming harm. Every move in the game has a telegraphed reaction animation or audible ping. If you tap the input key at this correct moment, the ability will alter in some way.
This typically results in you dealing extra damage, avoiding an enemy attack, or extra benefits. For example, the Geno Boost buff normally improves attack power temporally. But when timed, it also raises the characters’ defensive stats.


YouTuber Sny_Guy includes a great location where to practice Mario’s Super Jump move. This involves fighting Spiny foes near Mario’s house. They take no damage from Super Jump, allowing you to attempt the move an infinite number of times.
While it is easy to time your own attacks, it can be a bit harder to prepare for enemy attacks. Every new enemy and boss has unique timing and animation. Don’t fret if you have to test the waters on a new adversary or need to restart a battle entirely. 






 6  Keep Old Weapons 
        

The five party members of Super Mario RPG wield an array of weapons. This includes hammers, shells, sticks, cymbals, guns, and pans. Each has a specific attack animation, which changes the input timing. Some weapons like the Lucky Hammer will even give bonuses, such as doubling coins received after battle. This makes it worthwhile to keep around some older weapons with a more comfortable attack, even if they are overall weaker.
However, eventually, a character’s ultimate weapon will be the best option. These are all found rather late in the campaign and typically require some kind of side quest or puzzle. Using an older weapon will still be viable to beat the storyline, while ultimate weapons are more for taking on hidden bosses.





 5  Level Up For Custom Stats 
        

Since the game is an RPG, raw stats are the key to dealing more damage and surviving for longer. The max level is 30, but most of the storyline is designed for level 24 or below. While you will gain experience points at a steady pace, it is also possible to grind for additional levels. This gives new abilities at certain intervals.
Additionally, upon level up, you are also given the option of which specific stats to increase. This includes physical, hitpoints, or magic. The five main playable characters all have their strength and weaknesses, and major roles in the party. You may be inclined to focus stats on particular characters. After all, Bowser uses more physical attacks and Mallow favors magic. However, certain levels yield additional bonus stats for a selected increase. A good rule of thumb is to check all three possibilities, cancel out, and then only confirm the highest improvement.


YouTuber Veritas Gaming has a good method for getting level automatically. This involves going to the Booster Tower and purposely failing the Booster ancestry portrait puzzle. This will trigger a fight with relatively easy foes. The main drawback is this is done before recruiting Peach, which can result in her being much lower level than the rest of the team.





 4  Complete Sidequests 
        

As an RPG-first, there are plenty of rewards for going off the beaten path and engaging in side events. Each town and dungeon has a multitude of side quests to try out. Many of them are self-contained in a location and don’t require much backtracking. This can include talking to NPCs, collecting items, or even optional fights like challenging Jinx in his dojo.
Sidequests tend to yield a good amount of extra coins or special equipment. Some are longer quest chains that may grant access to new places, or unlock new dialogue from characters. Be sure to check the new integrated journal and go into the Scrapbook for additional details.





 3  Explore Like a Classic Mario Platformer 
        

While mainly an RPG, Super Mario RPG is also still a Mario game. Mario can always jump and run on the overworld and town screens. This means multiple secrets are in the terrain itself. This ranges from item chests, to new secret paths, and entirely new features. The Grate Guy’s Casino found in Bean Valley is one example.
You may even want to re-explore locations you have already visited. Early in the game, you can repeat the Midas River ride or the Minecart of Moleville. This gives a chance to pick up Frog Coins that can be redeemed later for prizes, including useful equipment.





 2  Use Mallow’s Thought Peek 
        

Mallow will learn a key ability called Thought Peek. This is mostly a copy of the classic Final Fantasy spell Scan. For just the cost of one Flower Point, it will display a target’s major statistics. This includes their total hitpoints, elemental weaknesses, susceptible status effects, possible item drops, and locations. There is also a quick blurb of what the enemy is thinking, leading to some hilarious insights about the world.


YouTube channel Nintendo Unity has compiled all the possible Thought Peeks in Super Mario RPG. This can allow you to check out all weaknesses without requiring the use of Mallow during every fight. It will also help conserve overall Flower Points for other moves.





 1  Team Swap Often 
        

Super Mario RPG has received new and revamped changes compared to the original. This includes adjustments to the combat system. The biggest difference is the ability to switch in other party members and put the rest in reserve. Mario is always a required character, so it comes down to the other two. The party members arrive with the same stats and hitpoints they had in the backline. This means fallen characters will need to be revived or otherwise protected with buffs.
Switching party members allows for all sorts of fun strategies. You are no longer required to always have a dedicated spot for Peach or Mallow to heal. Mixing in characters allows a full use of the Action Gauge and new Triple Moves. These are powerful team attacks that can quickly finish a fight.
