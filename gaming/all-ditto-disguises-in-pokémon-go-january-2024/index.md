## Literature Review

Ditto has a series of new disguises in Pokémon GO. This shapeshifting Pokémon only appears in the game disguised as one of nine Pokémon.





If you want to catch a Ditto in Pokémon GO, you need to find one of the Pokémon Ditto likes to disguise itself as and catch them. If you&#39;re lucky, after catching the Pokémon, it will reveal itself as a Ditto. Ditto&#39;s disguises change as time goes on, requiring players to catch different Pokémon in their quest to collect this lovable purple blob. Currently, there are nine confirmed Pokémon disguises that Ditto could be hiding as.

 All Pokémon That Can Be Ditto In Pokémon GO (January 2024) 
          

Ditto&#39;s repertoire of disguises changed in the middle of December 2023 after nine months of the same set of costumes. Four Gen 1 Pokémon joined the March 2023 disguise list for the Adamant Time event on December 11th, 2023. Rather than leaving after the event, players continued to report these four Pokémon as possible Dittos alongside a new set of Pokémon from Generations 3 through 7.

 Pokémon  Generation/Region   Oddish  Generation 1 (Kanto)   Koffing  Generation 1 (Kanto)   Rhyhorn  Generation 1 (Kanto)   Goldeen  Generation 1 (Kanto)   Numel  Generation 3 (Hoenn)   Bidoof  Generation 4 (Sinnoh)   Solosis  Generation 5 (Unova)   Bergemite  Generation 6 (Kalos)   Stufful  Generation 7 (Alola)   








Your best chances for finding a Ditto are by catching the most common Pokémon disguises, namely Oddish &amp; Bidoof.




                  Pokémon GO Shiny Odds (&amp; Why Raids Are Best) Explained   Shiny odds in Pokémon GO work very differently compared to the rates in the mainline series. There are a few factors that make them so different.   

Various reliable leakers such as Leek Duck have suggested that Cottonee could be another potential Ditto disguise; however, this disguise requires further research and is not as well-confirmed as the nine Pokémon listed above. Each of these Pokémon have an equal chance of being a Ditto upon appearance, but if they are Shiny Pokémon, they will not be Dittos. Shiny Dittos disguise themselves as regular Pokémon rather than Shiny Pokémon.

Catching a Ditto requires luck and a keen eye for one of its nine confirmed disguises. The more versions of these Pokémon you catch, the more likely you are to have a Ditto on your Pokémon GO team.
