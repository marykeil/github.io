## Literature Review

The Marbled Gohma is the Fire Temple Boss in Zelda TOTK. Link will need to beat it by targeting its weak spot with the help of Goron, Yunobo.





Like the other Temple bosses in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the Marbled Gohma appears as a boss, and Link does not have to fight alone. The Goron Yunobo assists you throughout this fight with a Charge Attack that Link can use to attack Gohma&#39;s legs and stagger the Cyclops. Gohma&#39;s simplistic attacks and easy-to-navigate arena make this one of the easiest Temple bosses and the perfect one to challenge first among the other Temples.




                  Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ending Explained (In Detail)   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is finally out, and its main campaign can be finished. Here are all the details regarding the game’s ending, explained.   


 How To Beat Fire Temple Boss’ First Phase In Zelda TOTK 
          

There are two phases to the Marbled Gohma boss fight, with the first being a standard brawl between Link, the fire-infused Cyclops, and Yunobo. During this segment, Gohma&#39;s single eye is a vulnerable, weak point, while Link can also attack the creature&#39;s crab-like legs in Tears of the Kingdom. Call on Yunobo&#39;s Charge Attack to heavily injure the boss&#39; legs until the body falls apart, allowing you to strike the eye with a melee weapon.



Try using Zelda: TOTK&#39;s Fuse ability to create some powerful melee weapons that will do large amounts of damage when Link has the opportunity to attack. Try using something like a Diamond, which adds a hefty amount of power to the base weapon.







Repeat this process a few times to expose the eye multiple times for a massive amount of damage to the boss&#39; health bar in Tears of the Kingdom. Watch out for one of Gohma&#39;s attacks that creates explosive rocks that the boss flings around the arena that can take out a good number of Link&#39;s hearts. These dangerous boulders take some time to blow up, though, so you should have plenty of time to get away after they land.



 How To Beat Fire Temple Boss’ Second Phase In Zelda TOTK 
          

Once Marbled Gohma has been damaged enough, the boss will jump to the ceiling and begin the second phase of the fight. Attacking the legs is no longer an option, but Yunobo can still use their Charge Attack to roll up the arena&#39;s walls and hit Gohma. Doing this a couple of times will again cause Gohma to drop to the ground with their body knocked apart for Link to hit their exposed eye in Tears of the Kingdom.






Yunobo may miss and have to recharge if not set up properly, but it’s better to just send him off whenever available because, more often than not, he will hit something. Once you attack the eye enough times from when the boss falls, it will retreat to the ceiling.




Watch out for Marbled Gohma&#39;s new attack during this phase, where the boss traps Link in a ring of explosive rocks. The chain reaction from these stone grenades will instantly kill Link unless you use your Recall ability in Tears of the Kingdom to move the hero of Hyrule through one of the rocks. Yunobo can also remove a stone from the circle using their Charge Attack, but you want to save that by knocking Gohma down to the ground.

Defeating Gohma at the end of the boss fight earns you a Heart Container, a special item that gives you a higher health total. You also will gain a new companion avatar in Yunobo the Fire Sage, a powerful friend for your adventure. Unfortunately, those who beat the Marbled Gohma in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will not be able to call upon Yunobo against other Temple bosses at elemental places other than Fire.
