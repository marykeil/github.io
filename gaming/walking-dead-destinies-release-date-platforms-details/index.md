## Literature Review

Here’s everything you need to know about The Walking Dead Destinies, including its release date, price, gameplay mechanics, story details, and more.




The recent announcement of The Walking Dead Destinies is good news for fans of AMC’s hit show, as well as the comic book series by Robert Kirkman. This is a new game set in the post-apocalyptic and walker-infested world of The Walking Dead and follows the story of the specific characters from the TV show. In fact, these heroes and villains share a likeness with the actors who played them on TV. Rick Grimes in the game resembles Andrew Lincoln’s character on AMC’s show, for instance, while Daryl Dixon in the new Walking Dead game is based on Norman Reedus’ likeness.




The Walking Dead Destinies will follow the main story told by the TV show and take players across several important locations, such as Atlanta, the Greene farm, the prison, and Woodbury. However, the main difference in this game is that players will be able to make key decisions that will mold the outcome of the narrative. Shane’s death at the Greene farm can be totally avoided, for example, with Rick being the victim at the scene. As such, it will be possible to create different teams of characters and progress differently through the story of the game when compared to the original licensed material.

As was announced by a trailer on publisher GameMill Entertainment&#39;s channel on YouTube, the release date for The Walking Dead Destinies is set for November 17. This date is valid for the digital version of the title, which will be available on all major digital storefronts. According to the official The Walking Dead Destinies website, the game will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam). While unspecified in the trailer, the website claims that the physical versions for PlayStation and Xbox will be released on December 1. The physical version for Nintendo Switch arrives on January 16, 2024.



According to the official website, the suggested retail price for The Walking Dead Destinies is $49.99.






 The Walking Dead Destinies - Story Details 
         




As was previously mentioned, The Walking Dead Destinies will follow the story told in the hit TV show by AMC. To be more specific, the game developed by Flux Game Studio and published by GameMill Entertainment will cover the first four seasons of the TV show. This will include Rick’s initial journey through Atlanta after he awakes in the hospital, as well as the group’s venture toward the farm owned by the Greene family. Eventually, players will make their way toward the iconic prison scenario, and then Woodbury, the survivor town led by Philip Blake, also known as the Governor.


 

By exploring these locations in The Walking Dead Destinies, players will be able to make alternative narrative decisions, choosing who stays alive and who dies, thus altering the course of the story. Carl Grimes can die from his gunshot wounds on the Greene family farm, for instance, while the results of the showdown between Rick and Shane can go in the entirely opposite direction. This will all affect the outcome of the next events in the game, such as who Lori greets with her newborn Judith at the prison – as suggested by the trailer, players can, apparently, make Lori survive her complicated labor.




It is uncertain exactly how much of the story will be changed in The Walking Dead Destinies when compared to the TV show, but it does seem like the important narrative decisions are related to key moments that usually revolve around certain characters’ deaths. Choosing which characters remain and which die is going to be a vital part of the gameplay experience as well, since these characters are the ones that will be used during walker encounters and other combat sequences – and building teams seems to be a vital aspect of the game. Different characters have different abilities and this naturally affects the gameplay.

 The Walking Dead Destinies - Gameplay Information 
          




Essentially, The Walking Dead Destinies is a third-person shooter that puts players in control of the iconic TV show’s characters while facing hordes of walkers that threaten their livelihood. With each character having a different type of proficiency with varied weapons, players will not only make choices to impact the narrative, but that will also affect their gameplay. Rick Grimes uses a Revolver as a ranged weapon and a bat as a melee weapon. If players choose to kill Rick off and leave Shane standing, for instance, they will have to use Shane’s shotgun and sledgehammer. This is then implemented by the team-building mechanic.

Players can then mix and match characters with different weapons to have more variety when facing these walkers. The official website states that there are “more than” 12 playable characters to choose from when building these teams. The Walking Dead Destinies will also have a stress mechanic, which is said to impact certain encounters with walkers. This is something of a survival horror game as well, so players will be able to use stealth to pass safely through certain locations and will have to manage their supplies and gather more resources for their party to survive the brutal environment.




Another important gameplay aspect featured in The Walking Dead Destinies is the ability to rescue survivors from the grasp of walkers – and perhaps even other hostile survivors. While this will not necessarily enable them to be part of the party, they may end up helping the player in some way. Through the various waves of survival, players will also be required to defend their base from invasions, staving off walkers with the characters that they have chosen to keep through the narrative choices mechanic.

While the ability to make narrative choices in the world of The Walking Dead is not exactly new, with Telltale’s popular game series spearheading it as early as 2012, the new title will mix it in with a third-person survival horror shooter experience. In addition to that, The Walking Dead Destinies seems intent on providing a different experience in the franchise, while building on the success of the popular TV show rather than telling a completely original story.
