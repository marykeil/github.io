## Literature Review

Xueyi is a new 4-Star Destruction character in Honkai: Star Rail whose kit revolves around reducing Toughness and building a follow-up attack.





If you want to get Xueyi as a New Year&#39;s addition to your roster of characters, the new year is the perfect time to pull for her. Xueyi has a drop rate boost on the Floral Triptych and A Lost Soul character banners running from December 27th, 2023, to January 17th, 2024. Once these banners end, Xueyi will join the pool of other 4-Star characters that can be pulled at any time.





 Best Light Cones For Xueyi 
          



A character&#39;s path restricts a character&#39;s Light Cone options. Characters can technically use any Light Cone but they will only activate a Light Cone&#39;s special ability if their Paths match. Therefore, Xueyi can only use Destruction Light Cones in Honkai: Star Rail.




There are a lot of top-tier Light Cones available for Xueyi, but they aren&#39;t all made equal for her kit. Her best-fit Light Cone not only has great synergy, but is available to all players through the Herta Store. Xueyi works best with On The Fall Of An Aeon thanks to its 12% DMG bonus for 2 turns when Xueyi inflicts a Weakness Break. The Light Cone also gives 8% ATK each time Xueyi attacks, with a maximum stack of four. Since Xueyi&#39;s Ultimate has special rules for a Weakness Break, she can frequently activate the DMG bonus.




Under The Blue Sky is another great choice for Xueyi in Honkai: Star Rail thanks to its overall huge bonuses. This Light Cone boosts Xueyi&#39;s ATK by 16%. If Xueyi defeats an enemy, she gets a 12% Crit Rate bonus for 3 turns. This requires her to take a stronger DPS role in her team comps and would be a poor choice for teams with a second DPS.

If you don&#39;t have Jingliu in Honkai: Star Rail, consider giving her signature Light Cone, I Shall Be My Own Sword, to Xueyi. When fully leveled up, this 5-Star Light Cone boosts Crit DMG by 32%. Once an ally gets attacked or otherwise loses HP, Xueyi gets a stack of Eclipse (max of 3) that increases her next attack&#39;s DMG by 24%. If Xueyi has all three stacks, she can also ignore 20% of her enemy&#39;s DEF (a skill that synergizes well with her Ultimate).

For a quick overview of the best build for Xueyi, take a look at the table below:

 Best Build For Xueyi In Honkai: Star Rail   Light Cones    On The Fall Of An Aeon (best 5-Star)   Under The Blue Sky (best 4-Star)   I Shall Be My Own Sword (5-Star substitute)   The Moles Welcome You (4-Star substitute)   A Secret Vow (4-Star substitute)      Relics &amp; Ornaments  Relics:  Genius of Brilliant Stars (4 pieces)   Thief of Shooting Meteor (4 pieces)   The Ashblazing Grand Duke (4 pieces - support build)    Ornaments:  Talia: Kingdom of Banditry (2 pieces)   Space Sealing Station (2 pieces - temporary substitute)      Stat Priority    Break Effect   Quantum DMG   ATK   Crit DMG/Crit Rate   SPD (optional)      Skill Priority    Talent   Ultimate   Skill   Basic ATK      








 Best Relics, Ornaments, &amp; Stats For Xueyi 
          

When you&#39;re deciding on the best Relics for Xueyi, you can go down one of three routes with one of three different Relic sets. The first is the classic choice for Quantum characters; the Genius of Brilliant Stars set. At two pieces, Xueyi gets a 10% Quantum DMG bonus. At four pieces, her attacks ignore 10% of an enemy&#39;s DEF with an additional 10% if the enemy has a Quantum Weakness. Since Xueyi focuses on eating away enemy Toughness, this Relic set synergizes well with her kit.

Thief of Shooting Meteor is a great alternate Relic set thanks to its focus on Break Effect. With four pieces, Xueyi will get a 32% Break Effect bonus in total and regenerate 3 Energy whenever she inflicts Weakness Break on an enemy. Since this will happen frequently with Xueyi&#39;s Ultimate, Thief of Shooting Meteor is a great fit. It is also perfect for the early game, as it is easier to collect than Genius of Brilliant Stars.




If you want to improve Xueyi&#39;s follow-up attacks and lean her more toward a support build, give her The Ashblazing Grand Duke Relic set. This set can be mixed with either of the other two sets to provide a 20% follow-up attack bonus. If you equip four pieces from this set, upon using a follow-up attack, Xueyi will get a stack of 8% ATK whenever she does DMG for a maximum of 8 stacks over 3 turns. Xueyi loses this effect the next time she triggers a follow-up attack.

                  Honkai: Star Rail - Hanya Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Properly build Hanya in Honkai: Star Rail and unlock the potential of a support unit who is perfect for hypercarry teams focused on maximum damage.   

Moving onto Ornaments, Talia: Kingdom of Banditry is the obvious choice for Xueyi in Honkai: Star Rail. With this Ornament set, Xueyi gets a 16% Break Effect bonus. If her SPD reaches 145 or higher, she&#39;ll get an extra 20% Break Effect. If you don&#39;t have good Ornaments in this set, you can use Space Sealing Station and its ATK bonuses as a temporary substitute.




When looking at stats, Break Effect is Xueyi&#39;s top priority. Her most important abilities play into Break Effect and her Trace enhancements typically boost Break Effect over anything else. If you&#39;ve gotten all her Traces and have Relics and Ornaments that also boost Break Effect, you can focus on Quantum DMG instead, as this will provide a strong general boost to all her attacks.



If you want the SPD bonus associated with Talia: Kingdom of Banditry, you may want to invest in Xueyi&#39;s SPD. However, this is optional, as she has a lot of other ways to get extra Break Effect.






 Best Team Comps For Xueyi 
         

Xueyi is generally a sub-DPS in her strongest team comps, but she is adaptable and capable of handling a main DPS position with the right teammates. Xueyi&#39;s goal in a fight is to weaken enemy Toughness to build up her Karma, a special stat connected to her Talent. Because she is building her Karma, her strongest teams have another DPS to pick up her slack.




 Best Team Comps For Xueyi in Honkai: Star Rail   Mono-Quantum Team    Xueyi (Quantum - Destruction)   Seele (Quantum - The Hunt)   Silver Wolf (Quantum - Nihility)   Fu Xuan (Quantum - Preservation)      Follow-Up Support Team    Xueyi (Quantum - Destruction)   Ruan Mei (Ice - Harmony)   Huohuo (Wind - Abundance)   Imbibitor Lunae (Imaginary - Destruction)      Free-To-Play Team    Xueyi (Quantum - Destruction)   Natasha (Physical - Abundance)   Yukong (Imaginary - Harmony)   Fire Trailblazer (Fire - Preservation)      



                  Honkai: Star Rail - Huohuo Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Huohuo is a powerful healer in Honkai: Star Rail who is capable of also acting as a stat booster for her team comp. Here are her best builds.   



 Skill Priority For Xueyi 
          

Xueyi&#39;s Talent is the most important skill you could invest in and is the core of her kit. This Talent keeps track of enemy Toughness reduced and gives Karma for every 30 Toughness taken. Once she collects 8 Karma, she launches a follow-up attack that deals three separate hits to a single target. With this Talent, Xueyi is constantly rewarded for fighting enemies with Quantum Weakness and is an effective DPS.




                  Honkai: Star Rail - Fu Xuan Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps)   Building Fu Xuan in Honkai: Star Rail is extremely easy and worthwhile. Here are the best Light Cones, Relics, Ornaments, stats, and more.   

Xueyi&#39;s Talent can be hard to trigger if there aren&#39;t many enemies on the field with a Quantum Weakness. Therefore, investing in Xueyi&#39;s Ultimate is another vital step in building Xueyi to her full potential. When Xueyi triggers her Ultimate, her attack ignores Weakness Types and is guaranteed to reduce enemy Toughness. If she triggers a Weakness Break with her Ultimate, the enemy will suffer a Quantum Weakness Break. The more Xueyi can trigger her Ultimate, the more she can feed her Talent.

Both Xueyi&#39;s Skill and Basic Attack are of lesser priority than her Talent and Ultimate, but if you need to choose which of those two to invest in, Xueyi&#39;s Skill is the best bet. All in all, Xueyi is a high ranking DPS and a great pull for many Honkai: Star Rail teams.
