## Literature Review

According to an alleged new leak, the list of returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet has been datamined.




New leaks about the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are featuring the previous Legendary Pokémon that are coming to the Gen 9 games. Ahead of the expansion’s release later in December, many leaks have been showcasing bits of content that will be added to the two games. There are several rumors and leaks about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: Indigo Disk, such as new forms for Koraidon and Miraidon, as well as the connection of certain NPCs to older characters in the franchise – which could potentially bridge the geographical gap between the games from Paldea and the rumored Gen 5 remakes in Unova, for instance.




It is also known that The Indigo Disk will also introduce some new special Pokémon, such as the mascot itself, Terapagos. There are also rumors about Dokutaro in the Pokémon: Indigo Disk DLC, which is said to be the leader of the Loyal Three from Kitakami and may be a Mythical creature with connections to the campaign, too. Regardless, there are now leaks indicating that the second expansion of the larger Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack will include the return of dozens of Legendary Pokémon from past Generations, including classics from Gen 1 to more recent additions in the franchise, made available with Gen 8’s Sword and Shield.

                  Indigo Disk DLC May Have Extra Paradox Pokémon, But There&#39;s Bad News   Leaks are indicating that an additional two Paradox Pokémon will be coming to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but there is a downside to the news.   


 25 Legendaries Are Returning With Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
         




As was highlighted by an alleged leak shared by Makio &amp; JRoses on X, the list of Legendary Pokémon that will be available in the upcoming expansion has been datamined. The leak details that 25 returning Legendary Pokémon will make their way into the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. According to the post, the list of creatures is not final and may be subject to change before the release. The account also says that some Legendaries may be version-exclusive and that they will likely be added through Tera Raid encounters. The table below lists all 25 datamined Legendary Pokémon for Indigo Disk:

 Returning Legendary Pokémon In The Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon  Type   Articuno    Ice- and Flying-type      Zapdos    Electric- and Flying-type      Moltres    Fire- and Flying-type      Raikou    Electric-type      Entei    Fire-type      Suicune    Water-type      Lugia    Psychic- and Flying-type      Ho-Oh    Fire- and Flying-type      Latias    Dragon- and Psychic-type      Latios    Dragon- and Psychic-type      Kyogre    Water-type      Groudon    Ground-type      Rayquaza    Dragon- and Flying-type      Cobalion    Steel- and Fighting-type      Terrakion    Rock- and Fighting-type      Virizion    Grass- and Fighting-type      Reshiram    Dragon- and Fire-type      Zekrom    Dragon- and Electric-type      Kyurem    Dragon- and Ice-type      Solgaleo    Psychic- and Steel-type      Lunala    Psychic- and Ghost-type      Necrozma    Psychic-type      Kubfu    Fighting-type      Spectrier    Ghost-type      Glastrier    Ice-type      








The post also suggests that these creatures will allegedly be added via Raid events, though there may be more Legendary and Mythical Pokémon made available via transfers between Pokémon HOME and Scarlet and Violet.






 Indigo Disk Follows A Trend From Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield 
          

If this list of Legendary Pokémon for the Indigo Disk DLC is, in fact, true, it seems like the second Gen 9 expansion is following the trend left behind by Pokémon Sword and Shield’s The Crown Tundra DLC. The second expansion of the Gen 8 games introduced a fully new area along with a set of new Pokémon, but also brought back several returning Legendary creatures. Over 50 rare creatures were added or made compatible with The Crown Tundra if considering the Ultra Beasts. While some were only transferable from Pokémon HOME, like Volcanion and Diancie, most of the others were catchable in Dynamax Adventures in the Max Lair.




In the expansion-exclusive activities, players could team up with NPCs or other players and go through a series of Max Raid Battles until they reach the Legendary creature at the very end. When defeated, they had a chance of capturing the Pokémon. Though Scarlet and Violet do not have Max Raids, it does have Tera Raids, and a similar challenging structure could be the secret to catching returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC. On X, Centro Leaks, a popular fan page focused on leaks regarding the Pokémon series, reposted the information by Makio_JRoses, mentioning that the 25 listed Pokémon are the Legendaries that are catchable in the DLC.

Though unconfirmed for now, having these Legendaries locked behind activities seems like the best bet for now. This does not mean that more Legendaries and Mythicals will not be made available in the future. Gen 8’s Sword and Shield had several distribution events, be they via Mystery Gift codes granted by partnering shops or battle events, like the Shiny versions of the Galarian Legendary birds. It is likely there will be more event Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC in the future, but these will likely not be catchable via the campaign.






 Are Legendaries In Pokémon Indigo Disk Shiny Locked? 
          

While most of the Legendaries in the base version of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are Shiny locked – meaning their Shiny versions cannot be obtained natively through gameplay, only through illegal methods – it seems like the returning Legendaries in the Indigo Disk DLC will not be Shiny locked. The information was shared by Centro Leaks’s post on X. This means that, when players face these creatures in the second expansion of the Gen 9 games, there is a small chance that they will show up in their alternative color palette. This was also the case with Legendaries in Gen 8’s The Crown Tundra DLC.

Of course, finding Shiny Legendaries should be no easy task, especially if the creatures are locked behind Tera Raid activities. Legendary Pokémon are unique and if they are locked behind Tera Raids, it should be a similar experience to the one in Crown Tundra. In The Crown Tundra DLC, players also had a chance of finding Shiny Legendaries in Dynamax Adventures, but the Shiny odds were small, so players often had to challenge the activity multiple times before finding the Shiny version. In the Indigo Disk DLC, it is unlikely players will be able to use the facilitated Shiny hunting methods of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find Shiny Legendaries.




Even if Shiny hunting them will be tough, the allegedly datamined list of returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk is exciting news, as many fan-favorites and powerful creatures are coming to the Gen 9 games. It is good to see Gen 8 Legendaries contemplated as well, even if they are considerably recent additions to the franchise. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC arrives for Nintendo Switch on December 14.
