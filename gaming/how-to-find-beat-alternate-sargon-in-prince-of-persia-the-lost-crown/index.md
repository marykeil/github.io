## Literature Review

Alternate Sargon is a dark version of yourself that you must beat four separate times in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as you find new locations.





There are four Alternate Sargon boss fights in Prince of Persia: TLC, but only one is required as part of a quest within the main story. Similar to how you can beat Living and Undead Erlik, extra fights can be found when you explore your map of the Citadel. Some of these battles are in hidden rooms that you may only be able to reach once you unlock specific powers from Simurgh Feathers.






One of the best ways to find Alternate Sargon boss fights is to purchase area maps from the NPC Fariba for 50 Time Crystals. Doing this will show you an outline of a region and reveal certain rooms you may not have visited before.




                  8 Beginner Tips You Need To Know For Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   The combat and exploration of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be confusing for beginners, but a few tips can mold Sargon into a great warrior.   


 How To Defeat Alternate Sargon In The Sacred Archives 
          

One of the first places you can find an Alternate Sargon is within the Sacred Archives area, one of the game&#39;s largest regions. If you keep exploring, you should be able to come across this reflection in a solitary room before exchanging some brief words. This Sargon is only slightly stronger than Elite enemies like the Sword Master in Prince of Persia: TLC, with less health.




Despite the weaker health of Alternate Sargon, they can use the same combos and launch attacks you do, which can trap you in unavoidable damage. Getting hit by Alternate Sargon usually leads to a small combo that sees you take strikes multiple times quickly. Alternate Sargon also has access to Menolias&#39; Bow to fire arrows at you from afar during this fight.



Keep in mind that Alternate Sargon can also dodge, slide, and parry your attacks since he has the same defensive maneuvers as you do.




The strategies for approaching this fight can be applied to all the Alternate Sargon fights in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown since every reflection has the same general attack patterns as you. Alternate Sargon can be launched into the air for combos that damage the boss&#39; health. Fire arrows or throw the Chakram from your Bow to interrupt some of Alternate Sargon&#39;s moves as well.

The one advantage Alternate Sargon has over you is access to an Athra Surge that you don&#39;t have in every fight. For the battle in the Sacred Archives, Alternate Sargon uses Shahbaz&#39;s Spirit, a powerful cross slash that strikes above the boss for massive damage both on the ground and in the air. Those who manage to avoid this attack should have a relatively easy time defeating this version of Sargon.






 How To Defeat Alternate Sargon In The Depths 
          

The second time you should encounter an Alternate Sargon is during the &#34;Tiger and Rat&#34; main quest that leaves you stranded in The Depths area under the Lower City. You may have visited this place before but will likely only be able to travel so far through the area. This version of Sargon is the only one you meet as a mandatory boss, similar to the Undead Prisoner in Prince of Persia: TLC.

This fight plays out almost the exact same way as the one in the Sacred Archives, but this Alternate Sargon has a bit more health than the last iteration. He suffers the same weaknesses as before, so make sure to juggle the boss into the air often. Use your parry to deflect Alternate Sargon&#39;s moves before they can lead to deadly combo attacks that will leave your health low.






From this point onward, Alternate Sargon can perform an Air Dodge to get out of your combos, which may disrupt your attack timing. Use Simurgh Dash to pursue the boss when he does this to keep up the pressure.




Alternate Sargon can use the Level 2 Arash&#39;s Ray Athra Surge this time, which fires a concentrated bolt of Athra energy from the boss&#39; bow that can&#39;t be deflected. Try to slide or dodge through this move if you see it happen to get a small attack window on Alternate Sargon. Be mindful of your opponent&#39;s options and move fast to eventually take this boss down.



 How To Defeat Alternate Sargons In The Soma Tree 

 

The Soma Tree area has a hidden room where you fight not just one but two Alternate Sargons at the same time. This fight is thankfully not too far from a Fast Travel spot, so make sure to equip your best Amulets in Prince of Persia: TLC and purchase some upgrades to prepare for this battle. These enemies have the same health and moves as the version you met in The Depths.




Besides the number of bosses, the only difference in this boss fight from the last is that each wields the Hadhayan&#39;s Might Athra Surge. This attack causes either Alternate Sargon to teleport over you before trying to slam into the ground with a powerful strike to injure you if you&#39;re close by. This attack could knock you out of a combo you were using against one of the bosses while the other remains active.

As seen in the above video by YouTube creator Ben-Gun, you may have your own Athra Surges that could be incredibly useful to deal with both Alternate Sargons. The Wind of Sistan can strike foes all around you and works excellently in battles where you are outnumbered. Make sure to dodge often and land as many hits as possible to charge your Athra enough to use this attack in Prince of Persia: TLC.



 How To Defeat Alternate Sargon In The Pit of Eternal Sands 
          




The final time you will fight an Alternate Sargon is in a hidden room within the Pit of Eternal Sands, or an area you must reach to challenge the serpent god Azhdaha. This Sargon will have more health than any boss you&#39;ve faced, but with the same moves you will have come to expect. This boss shares the same weaknesses as Prince of Persia: TLC, even though they have new tricks.

                  Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Review: &#34;An Underwhelming Story Redeemed By Riveting Combat&#34;   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great new addition to the Metroidvania subgenre that offers players unique combat and a good time.   

This Alternate Sargon will have the first instance of a Level 3 Athra Surge that you can discover in the game named Soul of Gilgamesh. When the boss activates this Surge, they channel Athra to become temporarily stronger and faster. Alternate Sargon&#39;s moves are enhanced to be faster, stronger, and deadlier.

Your goal here should be to take down Alternate Sargon before this massive buff to their abilities can matter. Remember to parry and use your own Athra Surges to gain the upper hand as you try to drain the boss&#39; health quickly. This Alternate Sargon will be the most difficult to defeat in Prince of Persia: TLC, but those who utilize careful and relentless aggression should be able to achieve victory.






 Rewards For Beating Every Alternate Sargon 
          

You receive Time Crystals and the Athra Surge that each Alternate Sargon used when you beat each of these bosses in Prince of Persia: TLC. This makes hunting down every boss fight a great way to gain new abilities to challenge the bosses seen in the main story. You can equip new Athra Surges whenever you rest at a Wak-Wak Tree found throughout the Citadel at any time.

​​​​​​​

When you manage to find and beat every Alternate Sargon, you have a chance to customize which special attacks work best for you as your journey continues in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.
