## Literature Review

One tiny Alan Wake 2 Easter egg might have deeper implications in the Alan Wake narrative, or it could mean absolutely nothing. 





[Warning: This article contains story spoilers for Alan Wake 2 as well as potential spoilers for the Night Springs and Lake House DLCs.]




One such clue is the creepy owl in Alan&#39;s office that follows the character with its eyes. While unsettling, it seems like it would be a completely innocuous addition to freak out those paying attention. However, another train of thought and theory could lend itself to uncovering the greater mysteries and unsolved story threads that have weaved their way into the Alan Wake narrative.

                  &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review   Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedy’s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.   


 Does The Owl In Alan Wake 2 Mean More? 
          

User shkegulka on X discovered the neat Easter egg by walking back and forth in Alan&#39;s office. As they do so, the owl&#39;s head moves along and tracks Wake wherever he goes. While this could be chalked up to a simple mechanic added for some creepy fun by Remedy, it also could have implications on the sometimes confusing connected universe between Alan Wake, Alan Wake&#39;s American Nightmare, Control, and the 6 part mini-series Bright Falls.





 

In a brief scene when Alan is talking to Thomas Zane — a filmmaker and character referenced in the original Alan Wake, there is a brief flash of Dr. Casper Darling on a CTR television screen. Those familiar with the series will remember that Dr. Darling was the Head of Research at the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), the government organization tasked with investigating paranatural activity in the 2019 title Control (via videotapes). The scientist was also a big force in the Alan Wake tie-in DLC, AWE, and the leading mind in the universe when it comes to alternate dimensions like the Dark Place.

                  Alan Wake 2: Do You Need To Play The Original &amp; American Nightmare First?   Alan Wake 2 returns 13 years after the original story concluded, introducing a new cast of characters for a brand-new audience of people.    




There&#39;s also a blurry but somewhat recognizable face and voice, possibly Jesse Faden, the protagonist from Control. In an alleged leak for the upcoming Alan Wake 2 DLCs, Night Springs and The Lake House, there are more scenes of Dr. Darling speaking directly into the camera with a board behind him that reads, &#34;WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.&#34; Later, the leaks show a more frantic Dr. Casper Darling, seemingly stuck in the Dark Place with a strange-looking device.



 What Does Any Of This Have To Do With The Owl? 
         

There are many directions that the game&#39;s writers can take the story of Alan Wake, but fundamental questions still go unanswered even after the sequel. While these questions may never actually be answered completely, there are a few connections between Control and Alan Wake. For one, Dr. Darling proved in AWE that he isn&#39;t beyond making human sacrifices, as the treatment of the paranatural Dylan Faden proved he&#39;d be willing to take drastic measures to learn more in the pursuit of knowledge.




                  Alan Wake 2 Ending Explained (In Detail)   Alan Wake 2 ends just as cryptically as it begins. Here’s what happens in the final chapters of the story, and what they mean for a sequel or DLC.   

While not physically present in Control, Dr. Darling has a huge impact on the overall narrative by discovering Hedron. Darling had a theory that this living organism seemingly powers the Slide Projector, which acts as a doorway to other dimensions in the Control series. Because his whereabouts are unknown, combined with the additional knowledge from the Alan Wake 2 DLC leaks, it can be assumed that Darling is now stuck in the Dark Place or at least another dimension capable of communicating with it.



In Control, the Hedron, though never seen, is believed to be the catalyst for Slidescape-36, an alternate dimension discovered by Jesse and Dylan Faden.




The owl is clearly watching Alan&#39;s every move, which indicates it has some sort of power in the Dark Place. This leads to two of many plausible theories. One is that Dr. Darling or the FBC is monitoring Alan, can peer into the Dark Place, and is trying to figure out a way to break him from his loop with the help of Alice. Another theory is that the owl is actually the Hedron or another entity that controls the dimension and the Dark Place&#39;s entities, like Scratch, and is watching events unfold in the never-ending time loop.






 The Owl Could Mean Absolutely Nothing 
         

Of course, these are all theories, and in the end, the taxidermied owl in Alan Wake&#39;s office could just be a creepy addition included by the developers. Being watched is eerie as it is, but constantly being watched while in Alan&#39;s writing room is even worse, as it should serve as his one place of solace (though it didn&#39;t stop Scratch). In addition, the owl does exist in the twisted version of reality that is the Dark Place, so the rules of physics and death don&#39;t really apply — leaving a reasonable narrative reason why the owl&#39;s head moves without tying into the greater Remedy-connected universe.

                  Alan Wake 2: All Cult Stash Locations &amp; Puzzle Solutions   22 Cult Stashes can be found in Alan Wake 2 to give you new items, but all these collectible locations have puzzles whose solutions open their loot.   




It isn&#39;t the first time that a feature like this has been included in a horror title, after all. Notably, the eagle in the original Resident Evil games moved to track the character in a similar fashion, lending itself to the theory that this could also just be a nod to one of the most iconic horror games ever made.

Regardless, with how intricate and well-crafted the Alan Wake and Remedy universe is, it&#39;s unlikely that a detail like this is completely random without any explanation. Throughout all of the Alan Wake titles, there&#39;s always a sense of paranoia and being watched, with some greater power controlling the universe. While the main antagonist would have seemed to be Alan himself by the end of Alan Wake 2, it&#39;s likely not the case, as it seems like others can also be caught up and affect the Dark Place, as Saga did toward the end of the game&#39;s narrative and as Thomas Zane did before Wake.
