## Literature Review

Iron Boulder quickly became a great choice for competitive Pokémon Battles in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet for both Double and Single battle formats.





It is highly recommended for a team with Iron Boulder to change it to a different Tera Type during a battle. This not only helps with its unfortunate typing of Rock- and Psychic-type but also makes it stronger against many Pokémon matchups through its new same-type attack bonus. Tera Types such as Water-, Fire-, or Fairy-type, can be used defensively, while Steel-, or Fighting-type, can boost many moves it can use offensively.









 








 10  Facade 
Double Your Power 
        

  Move   Type   Power   Description    Facade   Normal   70   Power is doubled if the user is poisoned, burned, or paralyzed.    
If you&#39;re having a rough time predicting or avoiding moves that inflict a status condition, consider using Facade on your Iron Boulder. These conditions, such as Paralysis or Burn, decrease Speed and Attack stats respectively. This will ruin Iron Boulder&#39;s potential to sweep your opponent&#39;s Pokémon. Countering this with Facade will double the damage Iron Boulder can do with the move, making it very viable in certain situations.





 9  Electric Terrain 
Boost Your Stats


 







  Move   Type   Power   Description    Electric Terrain   Electric   -   Boosts the Pokémon&#39;s most proficient stat on Electric Terrain or if the Pokémon is holding a booster energy.    
Electric Terrain setup for Iron Boulder could be very useful in the Scarlet and Violet meta-game. This is because of its ability, Quark Drive, which all Paradox Pokémon in Pokémon Violet share. According to Bulbapedia, Quark Drive boosts the most proficient stat on an Electric Terrain.
This means that Iron Boulder can boost its Speed to outrun another Pokémon or Defense to tank a big hit. Alternatively, if Iron Boulder doesn&#39;t set up the Electric Terrain, there is a held item called Booster Energy that can give Iron Boulder the same effect.
            
 
 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Iron Boulder (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC) 
The Legendary Pokémon Iron Boulder is a rare creature you can find and catch in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC if you finish a quest.








 8  Iron Head 
One Heck of a Headbutt
        

  Move   Type   Power   Description    Iron Head   Steel   80   The target is hit with a steel-hard head. This may also inflict &#34;flinch&#34; status.    
Pesky Fairy-type Pokémon have dominated the meta game since Generation 6. Thankfully, the Steel-type move Iron Head can be used by Iron Boulder with a lot of force, since it&#39;s super-effective against them. This can also be used on Pokémon who have Terastallized to types weak to Iron Head, making it viable as a core attacking move. It is also possible to flinch Iron Boulder&#39;s target if the move goes first.





 7  Earthquake 
Shake Your Enemies


 







  Move   Type   Power   Description    Earthquake   Ground   100   The user sets off an earthquake that hits every Pokémon around it.    
Commonly used in the Double Battle format in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Earthquake is a great move option for Iron Boulder. Hitting every Pokémon on the battlefield gives Iron Boulder an advantage. Pair it with a Flying-type Pokémon or Pokémon with the ability Levitate or Telepathy, and you&#39;ll be able to weaken your opponents very easily.

Pokémon&#39;s 18 types are at the core of the franchise&#39;s battle mechanic, each with its own weaknesses and resistances for Trainers to learn.








 6  Sacred Sword 
Swing Your Sword
        

  Move   Type   Power   Description    Sacred Sword   Fighting   90   The user attacks with a sword. The target&#39;s stat changes don&#39;t affect the damage done by this move.    
Sacred Sword can be taught to Iron Boulder as it is one of the original moves of the Swords of Justice. It is a Fighting-type move that counters Dark-type Pokémon, which are super-effective against Iron Boulder. Furthermore, this move is useful against match-ups that rely on stat changes. For example, if a Pokémon uses Iron Defense to bulk its stats, Sacred Sword cuts right through it.





 5  Taunt 
Force Your Opponents to Attack


 







  Move   Type   Power   Description    Taunt   Dark   -   The target is taunted into a rage that allows it to use only attack moves for three turns.    
Iron Boulder can be a great Pokémon to have Taunt on its move set for competitive play in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. There are very few Pokémon that can use it competitively, and it is an extremely helpful move. Since Iron Boulder is a fast Pokémon, Taunt can be set up during a Double or Single Battle immediately. This stops Pokémon from stalling, status inflicting, or stat-boosting.

 4  Zen Headbutt 
Hardcore Headbutt
        

  Move   Type   Power   Description    Zen Headbutt   Psychic   80   Focuses its willpower in its head and attacks the target. This may also make the target flinch.    
Iron Boulder&#39;s secondary typing in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is Psychic-type. It is also a physical attacking Pokémon, making Zen Headbutt a great option in its move pool. This is also considered to be a same-type attack bonus or STAB move, which means its power is increased by 50%.
Zen Headbutt also has the potential to flinch its opponent, especially if Iron Boulder is faster than the target. 






 3  Tera Blast 
Unleash The Power


 







  Move   Type   Power   Description    Tera Blast   Normal   80   If the user has Terastallized, it unleashes energy of its Tera Type. This move is both a physical and special attacking move.    
Tera Blast is a move introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that is perfect for Iron Boulder. This is because Iron Boulder can escape its harmful typing and use another type to its advantage. Tera Blast is also competitively viable since it is both a special and physical attacking move. For example, Iron Boulder cannot use any Fairy-type moves, which are strong in the metagame, except for Tera Blast Fairy-type.

There are many strong dual-type Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet, but some outrank the others in terms of reliability, abilities, and strength.








 2  Swords Dance 
Boost Your Attack
        

  Move   Type   Power   Description    Swords Dance   Normal   -   A dance to uplift the fighting spirit sharply boosting the user&#39;s Attack stat.    
If you want Iron Boulder to get ahead during a Pokémon battle, give it a turn to use the move Swords Dance. This move can boost Iron Boulder&#39;s attack stat twice in one turn, making it land super-strong hits on its target. It is commonly used for most physical attacking Pokémon.
For Iron Boulder, Swords Dance is a move learned by level up, but if that&#39;s not an option, it can also be taught by technical machines in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.





 1  Mighty Cleave 
Guarantee a Hit
        

  Move   Type   Power   Description    Mighty Cleave   Rock   95   Cleaves the target with the horn on its head. This move will hit an opponent even if they use a protection move.    
The best move to make sure you have on Iron Boulder in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is Mighty Cleave. Similar to how Urshifu&#39;s ability Unseen Fists works, Mighty Cleave can surpass a target&#39;s protection shield. This strong move changes the metagame, making unsuspecting players take large damage no matter what.
It is also a Rock-type physical attacking move that is super-effective against Ice-, Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types.
            
 
 How To Find (&amp; Catch) Gouging Fire (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC) 
Gouging Fire is a new Legendary beast to find in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, but it can be hard to catch this ancient form of Entei.
