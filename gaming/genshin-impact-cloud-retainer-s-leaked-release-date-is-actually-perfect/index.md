## Literature Review

New leaks suggest that the adeptus Cloud Retainer’s human form will be released as a playable character in an upcoming Genshin Impact patch.




The allegedly leaked release date for Cloud Retainer in Genshin Impact is starting to make a lot more sense as the game pushes forward into its third year of content. As a live-service title, the action RPG constantly receives more updates, with new patches being added every six weeks. It seems like in one of the upcoming updates, however, the humanoid form of a well-known adeptus will become completely playable, ending months of waiting. Cloud Retainer’s human form in Genshin Impact has been under debate among the community since her debut in January and, inevitably, rumors and speculation about her becoming playable have also been circling.




Cloud Retainer is one of the adepti, entities in Liyue that protect the region. Before his death, Rex Lapis was the leader of this group of gods and illuminated beasts. Throughout the campaign, players encounter Cloud Retainer in her bestial form, which is represented by an elegant white crane-like creature. However, in 2023’s Lantern Rite event in Genshin Impact, it was revealed that she possesses a human form, and her in-game debut, even if through an animated illustration rather than an actual 3D model, sparked curiosity and anticipation for a potential release. Luckily, it seems like players will not have to wait much longer to use Cloud Retainer in battle.

                  Genshin Impact Natlan Release Date Predictions (Based On Past Updates)   Although HoYoverse has not revealed the release date for Natlan in Genshin Impact, it is possible to predict exactly when it will arrive.   


 Cloud Retainer’s Release May Happen In Genshin Impact 4.4 
          




According to some recurrent leaks, one of which was reported by Sportskeeda, it seems like Cloud Retainer may be released as a playable character with the arrival of Version 4.4. If there are no delays and developer HoYoverse sticks to its regular six-week schedule between updates in Genshin Impact, Version 4.4 should arrive on January 31, 2024. Of course, if the leaks are accurate and she really is debuting in Version 4.4, there is a slight chance that she will only arrive in Phase 2, which would see her release date pushed to February 21, 2024. Regardless of the exact date, Cloud Retainer’s release in Version 4.4 makes perfect sense.



 Why Cloud Retainer’s Release Date In Genshin Impact Makes Perfect Sense 
         

The alleged release date of Cloud Retainer in Version 4.4 seems to align with the annual Lantern Rite Festival event that takes place in Liyue. This is an ideal moment for a character with such significance to the region to be released, as there is a chance she will also be featured in some manner during the event’s story missions in Genshin Impact. Cloud Retainer and her tale involving Guizhong were the main highlights of 2023’s Lantern Rite, and she could easily be further developed in 2024’s installment of the Liyue-themed event, especially given her burst in popularity after her human form was shown.




While the Lantern Rite Festival has not been officially confirmed for 2024, this is an annual event that has happened every year since the release of Genshin Impact. In fact, following the big x.0 updates that bring new regions and kick off new years of content, Lantern Rites tend to be one of the most important celebrations in HoYoverse’s RPG. Except for the very first Lantern Rite, which happened in late February with Version 1.3, all other installments of the event occurred in late January.



2022’s Festival started on January 25, with Version 2.4, while 2023’s Lantern Rite started on January 19, in Version 3.4.




By observing the period when Lantern Rites usually occur, it is possible to assume that it is very likely that 2024’s Festival will be, indeed, held in Version 4.4, which starts on January 31. If this event lines up with the alleged release of the Cloud Retainer, not only will players be able to celebrate her arrival as a playable character in Genshin Impact, but they may also be given more reason to pull for her. In case Cloud Retainer is featured as a character in the Lantern Rite’s story, her development could push players into trying their luck with the gacha system to obtain her.






 Cloud Retainer’s Leaked Abilities In Genshin Impact 
          

Even though she has not been confirmed or even teased as a playable character in Genshin Impact, it seems like there are already leaks regarding Cloud Retainer’s gameplay kit. As reported by Sportskeeda, the crane-like adeptus is expected to operate as a support and sub-DPS unit in a team comp. Cloud Retainer will, reportedly, work well with Xiao, one of the most powerful Anemo DPS characters in the game – although details about her Vision or innate elemental powers have not been revealed, this report suggests she may enhance the power of Anemo, which could imply she herself uses Anemo in battle.



So far, Cloud Retainer using Anemo is pure speculation based on reports.







Although the element Cloud Retainer wields is still unknown and wildly up to speculation, leaks about her gameplay kit suggest that she is a Catalyst user. This essentially means that whatever element she does use gets applied to enemies with Normal and Charged Attacks, without having to rely on Elemental Skills or Elemental Bursts. It seems like Cloud Retainer will be able to provide support with off-field abilities, allowing her to work without having to be the active character. Off-field supports and sub-DPS tend to be some of the best in the game, such as Xinqiu, Raiden Shogun, and Yelan in Genshin Impact.

There is also debate about Cloud Retainer manipulating Cryo rather than Anemo. The adeptus has two disciples, Shenhe and Ganyu, and both of them are Cryo characters in the game. Though it is uncertain whether she will use Anemo or Cryo (or another element altogether), these seem like the most likely elements for Cloud Retainer to wield in combat. According to Sportskeeda, the character also has some healing abilities, though they are not too powerful. Moreover, leaks say that Cloud Retainer can heal while also damaging opponents in Genshin Impact. Her healing would stem from her Elemental Burst, which allegedly is an AoE Anemo field that can also Swirls elements.




According to the leaks reported by Sportskeeda, Cloud Retainer’s Elemental Skill could allow her to fly. It is possible that, by activating it, she assumes her illuminated beast form temporarily rather than staying in human form. It is uncertain if this flight will be more similar to Wanderer’s Elemental Skill or Fischl’s Elemental Burst. Other than providing Swirl reactions and healing, reports suggest that Cloud Retainer can build up stacks when party members’ HP fluctuates. She can then consume these stacks to reduce the enemy’s Defense. This could be why it is reported she pairs up well with Xiao in Genshin Impact.

The Anemo DPS loses HP through his Burst and, if she reduces the opponent’s Defense, Cloud Retainer could set the ground for Xiao to wreak havoc. Other HP-loss DPS characters that could work with her in case there are no Elemental restrictions to her abilities are Neuvillette, Lyney, Furina, and Hu Tao. Sportskeeda also reports rumors that suggest a new Artifact set in Version 4.4, which could be used by Cloud Retainer. In turn, these items would increase her value as a sub-DPS in Genshin Impact through boosted damage output.




Of course, it is still too early to tell, with Version 4.3 not even confirmed so far. Nevertheless, as the game progresses and it gets closer to Version 4.4, leaks and rumors about Cloud Retainer as a playable character should intensify. They should always be taken with a grain of salt, as they can be inaccurate or subject to change. It does seem, however, like the adeptus is finally landing in Genshin Impact.
