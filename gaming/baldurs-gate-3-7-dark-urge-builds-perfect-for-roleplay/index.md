## Literature Review

The Dark Urge Origin in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has an intriguing but bloody backstory. Here are some fun builds to help roleplay such an odd character.




Baldur’s Gate 3’s Dark Urge Origin is unique to the other Origin characters as it allows more freedom while still playing an interesting fixed backstory. Race and class can be changed to suit the particular playthrough; however, the Dark Urge&#39;s background provides a fantastic connection to the main plot of BG3. Certain classes and subclass, though, are a better fit for roleplaying such a complicated character.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
In many ways, it feels like it was intended for the Dark Urge to be the main character of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as their backstory links more heavily with the plot and the history behind the Absolute. Throughout the game, it is up to each individual playthrough whether to give into the character&#39;s past or not. So, given the Dark Urge&#39;s background and inherent skills, what classes work well for roleplaying Bhaal&#39;s former Chosen?

 7  Class: Druid 
Subclass: Circle Of Spores
        

The Circle of Spores druid works well for a Dark Urge playthrough as it has the capacity to cover either a good or evil version of the character. As with all druids, the Dark Urge will be able to wild shape and gain access to classic support spells to buff and heal the rest of the party. However, the Circle of Spores druid adds a little more damage dealing into the mix with a heavy dose of necromancy that seems fitting for a Bhaalspawn.
Circle of Spores druids can deal necrotic damage with their Halo of Spores, as well as raise zombies in two different ways. While any race can be chosen, an elf or half-elf works well thematically, and also provides the Fey Ancestry bonus against being charmed. This blend of nature and decay is great for roleplaying the Dark Urge&#39;s inner conflict as they slowly rediscover their heritage over the course of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.





 6  Class: Warlock 
Subclass: The Great Old One
        

The Great Old One warlock is possibly the only warlock build that makes sense with the lore of the Dark Urge. While a fiend or archfey may not want to make a deal with a Bhaalspawn, an ancient being from the Far Realms wouldn&#39;t bat an eye. The Great Old One warlock gains several spells that are very in keeping with the Dark Urge&#39;s backstory, such as dissonant whispers, bestow curse, and dominate person, which would have helped them in their life before BG3 to control the situation as they murdered in the name of Bhaal.
For race, githyanki makes a great choice and works well with this warlock subclass. Having a githyanki bound to a being from the Far Realm makes a lot of sense, as their people are used to traversing the planes, and it is feasible that one of them would have gotten the attention of a powerful being. However, more practically speaking, creating a githyanki warlock would give access to medium armor as well as misty step, which will aid in making a spellcasting Dark Urge a little better equipped on the battlefield.

 5  Class: Wizard 
Subclass: Necromancy


 







Specializing in death and using the undead to serve them, having a Dark Urge necromancer is a lot of fun. Necromancers have a handy way to heal themselves with Grim Harvest, which lets them regain hit points when they kill an enemy with a spell. And, of course, they are able to raise more and sturdier undead thralls than other wizards using the animate dead spell.
Given how many corpses the Dark Urge would have been around, it makes sense to have repurposed them, and for those who want to lean into the murderous urges of this Origin, then there will be plenty of opportunities throughout BG3 to keep the camp chest stocked with &#34;supplies.&#34; When creating a necromancer, high elf or high half-elf works really well, as they gain an extra wizard cantrip. Otherwise, half-orc is a good choice for a squishier build, as their Relentless Endurance feature will keep the Dark Urge up in battle a little longer.





 4  Class: Sorcerer 
Subclass: Wild Magic
        

The default class for the Dark Urge is sorcerer, and specifically, a Storm sorcerer. Having the Dark Urge possess some innate magic seems very logical given their family background, but it serves the character better if, instead of giving them power over the storm, their magic was a little more unpredictable. This is where Wild Magic comes in, and given the history of the Dark Urge, which is revealed throughout BG3, it makes sense that their magic might be as confused as they are.
Wild Magic sorcerers have some great features beyond their chaotic Wild Magic Surges. Tides of Chaos at level one lets the Dark Urge gain advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws with the trade-off being an increased chance of a Surge. Bend luck at level six also acts as a sorcerer version of guidance, letting them add or subtract 1d4 from ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws. For race, either gold or shield dwarf are good choices, as with gold dwarf the sorcerer will gain extra hit points, while with shield dwarf they will gain proficiency in light and medium armor.

 3  Classes: Rogue &amp; Ranger 
Subclasses: Assassin &amp; Gloomstalker
        

For a multiclass Dark Urge option, the Gloomstalker Assassin is really fun to play and fits well with the character’s backstory. To create this BG3 build, start out by taking three levels of rogue to gain Sneak Attack, Cunning Action, and the ability to choose the Assassin subclass. Assassins regain their actions and bonus actions at the start of combat, auto crit against surprised creatures, and have advantage on attack rolls against enemies who have not yet taken their turn in combat.
Choosing to level rogue first lets the character take advantage of Sneak Attack damage immediately, which is very useful in the early segments of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. 

Then, switch over to ranger for the rest of the game, with the Gloomstalker&#39;s Dread Ambusher feature giving plus three to initiative rolls to help gain advantage over enemies. For race, wood elf or wood half-elf is a good idea, as they have the feature Mask of the Wild that gives them proficiency in Stealth. Other good choices are deep gnome or lightfoot halfling, who both have advantage in Stealth checks as racial features.





 2  Class: Monk 
Subclass: Way Of The Shadow


 







For a deadly Dark Urge in BG3 who attacks from the shadows with their bare hands, then the Way of Shadow monk is perfect. On top of great monk abilities like Flurry of Blows, Deflect Missiles, and a steadily increasing movement speed, the Shadow Monk also gains several features to help control and pick off targets in a fight. At level three, the Shadow Monk gets the feature Shadow Arts, with five abilities to hide from enemies, aid the party in Stealth checks, and silence enemy spellcasters.
At level six, Shadow Step lets the Dark Urge teleport through the shadows, which is very fitting for an assassin of Bhaal. Then, at level 11, Shadow Strike lets them teleport to a target for an attack which will deal extra psychic damage. Wood elf and wood half-elf work brilliantly for this, as their Fleet of Foot racial feature increases the character&#39;s movement speed. Combining that with the monk&#39;s increases means that at later levels the Dark Urge will have fantastic battlefield mobility, in keeping with their former status as Bhaal&#39;s Chosen.

 1  Classes: Rogue &amp; Monk 
Subclasses: Thief &amp; Way Of The Open Hand


 







Finally, another multiclass option for the Dark Urge comes from the Open Hand Thief, which combines the extra attack from the Thief rogue subclass with the Way of the Open Hand monk&#39;s extra Flurry of Blows options. Using the Thief&#39;s extra bonus attack means that the Dark Urge will be able to deal out a staggering amount of damage in a single round of combat, with the possibility to knock enemies prone or even push them five meters away. This can be further enhanced by choosing the Tavern Brawler feat at level four for one of the most fun-to-play builds in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
While wood elf and githyanki work well for this build it can be fun to choose duergar for a little extra roleplay and chaos. Duergar were once enslaved by the mind flayers, so having the Dark Urge lose their memories to an illithid parasite is a wonderful twist. However, duergar also get the enlarge spell at level one, which they can use once per long rest to deal out an extra 1d4 to attacks to create an even bigger threat during Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s many battles.
