## Literature Review

A New Game Plus mode for Alan Wake 2 has been released that builds upon the game&#39;s lore while carrying weapons and more over into later playthroughs.




A New Game Plus mode for Remedy&#39;s highly acclaimed survival horror game, Alan Wake 2, has been released, titled The Final Draft. New Game Plus is a feature expected in many story-driven titles as a way to revisit a game&#39;s narrative without having to restart progression entirely, and while The Final Draft certainly has this feature, there are plenty more additions to the mode that are sure to make players want to revisit Alan and Saga&#39;s entangled story.




[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Alan Wake 2&#39;s ending and epilogue.]Alan Wake 2&#39;s story takes place 13 years after the events of Alan Wake and continues the titular author&#39;s story, after he became trapped in the mysterious alternate dimension, The Dark Place, after using his light to rescue his wife, Alice from there. The story also introduces a new playable character, FBI agent Saga Anderson, whose investigation of a series of ritualistic murders in the village of Bright Falls ties into the mystery surrounding a shadowy entity named Mr. Scratch and the various alternate dimensions.

                  &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review   Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedy’s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.   


 The Final Draft Is Intended As Part Of Alan Wake&#39;s Lore 
Alan Wake 2&#39;s Narrative Changes In New Game Plus
         




The Final Draft is essentially a New Game Plus mode, and therefore, players must complete a playthrough of Alan Wake 2 to unlock it. However, Remedy intended for The Final Draft to serve as part of the series&#39; lore, rather than merely a way to replay the game&#39;s story - something that was also done in Bethesda&#39;s Starfield earlier this year as a way to offer a new experience upon repeat playthroughs.

A PlayStation Blog by Remedy Entertainment&#39;s Creative Director, Sam Lake explored some of the changes players will experience further. According to Lake, things have shifted in subtle ways as players progress from the main campaign into The Final Draft. There is new lore to be found in the form of new videos and manuscript pages across levels, and even Alan Wake’s narration seems to be slightly different as the writer has the occasional moment of clarity and seems to be more aware of having experienced certain events before, even if this soon fades.

The inclusion of new manuscript pages is a returning mechanic from the first Alan Wake, which included them in that game&#39;s Nightmare mode. In the original game, these added more context to the core story, revealing further details that might&#39;ve been considered spoilers on a first playthrough. However, in Alan Wake 2 they seem to actively be playing a part in changing the narrative and progressing the story further.






As with the first game, Alan Wake 2 will include a new Nightmare difficulty in its New Game Plus, which will be the hardest in the game.




This works perfectly with Alan Wake 2&#39;s core narrative, as the titular author has been trapped in a nightmarish loop in an alternate dimension, The Dark Place, for 13 years. Finally, through The Final Draft, players can work to set Alan free from what he once believed to be a loop by proceeding deeper into the &#34;spiral&#34; Alan mentions as part of his revelation in the game&#39;s epilogue. As per Lake&#39;s Playstation Blog post, Alan will now have the help of his wife Alice to do this, as the game&#39;s epilogue also revealed that she had been investigating the events in Bright Falls after Alan freed her from The Dark Place and is finally getting closer to solving the mystery surrounding the alternate dimension.

                  Alan Wake 2 New Game Plus &#34;Final Draft&#34; Explained   Alan Wake 2 is getting a mysterious New Game Plus mode called Final Draft. Here’s what it involves, and how it ties into future plans for DLC.   






 The Final Draft Will Have A New Ending 
Remedy Believes This Will Spark Further Speculation
          

Whereas Alan Wake 2&#39;s core campaign didn&#39;t include multiple endings, a post on the official Alan Wake website confirms that The Final Draft will unveil a new ending that Remedy Entertainment believes will &#34;spark speculation and theories&#34;. It&#39;s unclear, however, how this will feed into Alan Wake 2&#39;s two confirmed DLCs: Night Springs and Lake House.

Night Springs will likely revolve around the Twilight Zone-esque anthology series that appears regularly in Remedy&#39;s connected universe, and therefore probably won&#39;t be altered too much by the new events of The Final Draft. Considering Alice&#39;s mention of making contact with an unnamed organization as part of her investigation, it&#39;s possible that Lake House will be a crossover with Control, and could tie into Alan Wake 2&#39;s story more directly.






Control previously had a crossover with Alan Wake in its AWE DLC.




The synopsis for Alan Wake 2&#39;s Lake House DLC is intentionally vague - likely to avoid spoilers - but confirms that it will take place in a secret government research facility, so it would make sense for the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) to be involved, especially as Control&#39;s AWE DLC confirmed that the FBC poured a significant amount of time and money into researching Bright Falls. If so, it&#39;s possible this DLC could show Alice conducting her investigation with the FBC in parallel with the events of Alan Wake 2&#39;s main story.

                  Max Payne Remake, Alan Wake 2 &amp; Control 2: A Remedy Renaissance Is Coming   With Remedy Entertainment currently working on new releases and remakes for Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Control, fans have plenty to look forward to.   






 What Is Carried Over From Alan Wake 2? 
Weapons, Charms, And Upgrades Are Carried Over
          

As is the case with most games&#39; New Game Plus modes, players will retain all of the weapons, charms, and Words of Power character upgrades for both Alan and Saga that have been earned during their first playthrough of the game. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that New Game Plus doesn&#39;t start with the weapons already in players&#39; inventories, and these unlocked weapons can be found in the first available shoebox for each character. These should go a long way in assisting players with the increased challenges of The Final Draft&#39;s Nightmare difficulty and will further complement the idea that Alan is trapped in a spiral, rather than a loop during Alan Wake 2.
