## Literature Review

More than a decade after the release of the original game, Dragon&#39;s Dogma II has received a release date, along with new story and gameplay details.




Over a decade past the initial 2012 release of the first game, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 has finally received a confirmed release date in a new showcase of the game, along with the reveal of new details regarding its world, story, and gameplay. Set in an expansive fantasy world, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 will once again have players taking on the role of the Arisen, in a quest to slay the titular dragon. Unlike the original Dragon&#39;s Dogma, however, the sequel promises a more complete experience, with additional vocations, areas, races, characters, and an entirely new story, with expanded gameplay systems to match.




While the original Dragon&#39;s Dogma has never enjoyed the explosive popularity of other big Capcom franchises like Monster Hunter or Resident Evil, the game has become something of a cult classic in the years since its release, held in high regard by many for its unique RPG systems, well-realized fantasy monsters, and combat that more resembles that of an action game like Devil May Cry than a traditional RPG. As such, the official announcement of Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 by director Hideaki Itsuno in 2022 had fans hopeful for a game that could deliver a more complete experience than the first game, while also patching up some of its more prominent flaws.

 Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Releases On March 22, 2024 
         

As of the most recent trailer for the game, which showed off new story, areas, and gameplay, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 is set to release on March 22, 2024 for Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. As a sequel to the original game, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 promises to offer significantly expanded areas, gameplay, and story, with a new cast of characters and multiple major additions to the world, making it significantly more fleshed out and expansive than the Gransys of the original game. Additionally, the game promises major changes to two of the unique systems from the original, vocations and Pawns, along with several new and revamped enemies.






 Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Story Details 
          

Despite Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 being billed as a sequel to the first game, the recent showcase has confirmed that, instead of following directly after the events of the first game, DD2 will instead feature an all-new story set in a parallel world to the original. This is illustrated well by the story details revealed in the showcase and the newest trailer, as practically no characters from the first game make any sort of appearance - aside from the titular dragon, which has the same look and voice as Grigori from the first game (although not confirmed to be the same character), Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 features an entirely different cast.


 




Although the game takes place in a parallel world, the basic framing of the story is similar - the player takes on the role of the Arisen, who has had their heart taken from them by the dragon, and must seek to slay it, accompanied by Pawns who serve as assistance. Unlike the first game, though, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 will include at least two major geo-political factions - Vermund, the human kingdom, and Bahttahl, a nation of a newly-introduced race known as beastren. Additionally, a third race exists in the form of elves, who dwell in a region known as the Sacred Arbor, and speak their own language.

While the exact details of the story remain to be seen, a few conflicts have already been set up from the promotional material - the overarching quest, obviously, is to slay the dragon, but several other storylines appear to come into play. Disa, the Queen Regent of Vermund, for example, seeks to set up a false Arisen, whom the Pawns mysteriously obey, and to have her son Sven take over as the new ruler. Meanwhile, the people of Bahttal reject Pawns entirely - although both nations see the threat posed by the dragon, it seems that much of DD2&#39;s story will revolve around how they behave towards the Arisen and the Pawns.

 Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Gameplay Details 
          

Moving away from the story, the Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 showcase (via Capcom USA&#39;s YouTube channel) also displayed a variety of new and returning enemies and classes; however, the core of Dragon&#39;s Dogma&#39;s combat seems largely similar in the sequel. Most prominently, the showcase introduced a new enemy, the Talos - a giant, walking statue that seemingly must be fought by destroying weak points that take the form of rocky formations protruding from various points of the enemy&#39;s body. The showcase displays a few methods of getting to these weak points, with the Arisen simply jumping onto the Talos&#39; body and climbing to them, hitching a ride on a nearby flying enemy, or shooting at them with a bow.





 

The showcase also displayed an entirely new vocation not present in the original - the Trickster. Wielding a censer, Trickster is a player-exclusive vocation, meaning that it can&#39;t be used on Pawns, and centers around the use of illusions to disrupt enemies and buff allies. In addition to the Mystic Spearhand class introduced previously, Trickster makes for the second entirely new vocation revealed so far for Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 (not counting Thief and Archer, which are essentially the first game&#39;s Strider split into two), and the ninth overall vocation. Warrior and Sorceror were also shown as returning classes, alongside returning enemies like the Drake and Dullahan.

Outside of combat, character creation has been shown to be similar to the first game as well, allowing for near complete control over the Arisen&#39;s appearance, as well as the completely new option to create characters of races other than human, like beastren or elves. Once again, players will create their own Arisen and Main Pawn, and can hire up to two other Pawns created by other players. Notably, Pawns can have additional specializations in Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2, such as the ability to translate the language of the Elves or automatically take items from the player&#39;s inventory if they&#39;re overburdened.






 Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Pre-Order Bonuses &amp; Deluxe Edition Differences 
          

Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 is now available for pre-order on all platforms, with a Deluxe Edition that includes several additional in-game items. Those who pre-order Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 will receive the Superior Weapons Quartet, four weapons – one for each of the starting vocations – to help purchasers get a leg up in the game&#39;s earliest encounters. Pre-ordering the Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition also has pre-order bonuses in the form of additional accessories, only one of which, the Ring of Assurance, has been revealed so far.

The Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition entitles players to a number of digital goods: special Camping Gear, Rift Crystals &#34;to spend beyond the rift,&#34; a Dragon&#39;s Dogma Music &amp; Sound Collection, and a number of in-game items. The extent to which Camping Gear and the Rift Crystals can be used is unclear, but the Music Collection is likely a digital copy of the DD2 soundtrack. Most of the Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition in-game items are similarly mysterious in their use, though they appear to be early-game items, much like the pre-order bonuses. For instance, one Deluxe Edition item is a Makeshift Gaol Key, and the Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 website mentions its story &#34;begins in an underground gaol.&#34;






Pre-orders opening for Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 was accompanied by Dragon&#39;s Dogma: Dark Arisen going on sale for a limited time.




Though held in high regard by its fans, the original Dragon&#39;s Dogma was ultimately a niche game with some notably large flaws and a vast amount of content that ended up on the cutting room floor. Hopefully, for longtime fans of the first game, Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 will be the complete experience that the original game aimed to deliver.
