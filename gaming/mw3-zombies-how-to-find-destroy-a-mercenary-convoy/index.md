## Literature Review

One of the missions given in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies during Act 1 of the story is to find and destroy a Mercenary Convoy full of enemy soldiers.





Attacking a mercenary convoy comes from the Tier 2 mission called &#34;Interceptor&#34; in Act 1 of the story for Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. You may have seen one or two of these military groups before as you explored the vast regions of Urzikstan either solo or with a team. Your objective for this specific contract asks you to acquire a keycard held by the mercenaries while avoiding certain death from the zombie outbreak.




                  Modern Warfare 3: The Fastest Ways to Earn XP   As Modern Warfare 3&#39;s release grows closer, there will likely be ways to earn XP the fastest, allowing you to level up weapons and unlock new gear.   


 How To Locate a Mercenary Convoy In Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

The only way to find a mercenary convoy is to search bridges and roads around Urzikstan since the enemy squads spawn in random locations during each of your deployments. When you drop onto the map, these soldiers do not appear on your TacMap. However, when a mercenary convoy spawns, you&#39;ll get a message telling you the group is nearby for your squad to pursue Zombies in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.



Each zone in Urzikstan has different difficulties based on how severe the zombie outbreak is. Mercenary groups are tougher when encountered in areas close to the map&#39;s high-tier red areas and medium-tier orange sections.







Once you come across a convoy, follow it and try to eliminate the drivers of the enemy group&#39;s vehicles from afar. There are usually three cars that the mercenaries use for transport, carrying numerous soldiers that start to pour out and attack when provoked by Zombies in MW3. You need to kill every enemy in the convoy to &#34;destroy&#34; the mercenary squad while remembering that zombies are still a threat during the firefight.

After all threats have been neutralized, look around for the soldier of the highest rank among the dead. Finding the blue keycard completes your mission, allowing you or your squad to extract from the map and earn rewards in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies for destroying the mercenary convoy.
