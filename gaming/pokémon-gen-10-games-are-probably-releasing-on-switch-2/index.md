# Pokémon Gen 10 Games Are Probably Releasing On Switch 2


## SUMMARY 



  The next generation of Pokémon games will likely be released on the rumored Switch 2 console, taking advantage of its upgraded hardware for an improved gaming experience.   The timing of the Switch 2&#39;s expected release aligns with the lack of news on future core Pokémon games, suggesting that the next core games and Gen 5 remakes may be released on the Switch 2.   The Switch 2&#39;s enhanced capabilities can address performance issues seen in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, providing a better play experience and stability for future Pokémon titles.

## Literature Review

Circumstances surrounding the future of the Pokémon franchise suggest that the Generation 10 games will be released for the Switch 2 console.




It seems extremely likely that the next Generation of the Pokémon franchise will be launching on the long-rumored Switch 2 console. As technology advances, newer and better hardware allows for an ever-improving gaming experience, and Pokemon takes full advantage of this as one of Nintendo’s flagship franchises. Moreover, considering the timeframes relating to upcoming releases, it seems all but inevitable that the release of the next core games will coincide with the company’s next console.




Although the console’s existence has still not been officially confirmed, it is currently widely believed that the Switch 2 will be coming out in 2024. Almost nothing is known for sure about the console’s capabilities (including its true name), but it seems likely to essentially be an upgraded version of the current Nintendo Switch, similar to the relationship between the 3DS and the original DS handhelds. Of course, there have been many rumors surrounding its capabilities of varying reliability, with at least some Switch 2 leaks even being clearly faked. But regardless of what form the Switch 2 will actually take, it is certainly well on its way to release.

                  Every New &amp; Returning Pokémon Added To Scarlet &amp; Violet’s Teal Mask DLC   The Pokédex count for Generation 9’s Scarlet and Violet was increased with the new and returning Pokémon added with the Teal Mask expansion.   


 The Timetable For The Switch 2 And Future Pokémon Games Aligns Perfectly 
          




It is an intriguing point of interest that beyond Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC being released this December, no further major titles have been announced at this point in time. For all intents and purposes, this means that the calendar for 2024 is currently devoid of any new core Pokémon games, a state of affairs that seems unlikely to stay the same for long. In addition to the future Generation 10 games, there are also the expected remakes of Gen 5’s Pokémon Black and White to consider. Given the Switch 2’s own projected release date, the lack of news regarding such titles does not feel like a coincidence.

Barring any other surprise announcements, such as a new Legends game, it is probable that Gen 5 remakes will be the next core Pokémon games to be announced and released, in 2024 at the earliest. While the same can be said of entirely new Gen 10 titles, it would be highly unusual for Gen 9 to consist solely of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and the associated DLC, and so it is very possible that the remakes will fall under the umbrella of Gen 9. Although the reverse could be equally true, in any case, it seems probable that the next original Pokémon games will be available for the Switch 2.





 

As a consequence of the timing, it is now very believable that the debut of Pokémon’s Gen 10 will accompany the Switch 2. Given that the Gen 5 remakes are expected in 2024, this would suggest a mid-year release if Gen 10 is to accompany the Switch 2 later on in the year, perhaps for a Winter release date in time for the holiday season. Alternatively, if the Gen 5 remakes will be part of Gen 10, they could be part of the Switch 2’s launch catalog themselves, although it should be noted that such a prestigious position also implies a significant overhaul of the original games.



Remakes of previous Pokémon games have been a part of nearly every Generation since Gen 3, with the only exception to this so far being Gen 5.









 The Switch 2 Can Be A Great Boost To Pokémon Games 
          

It has always been natural for Pokémon games to take full advantage of their native console’s hardware. For example, the Nintendo DS’ ability to accommodate Game Boy cartridges led to Gen 4’s Pal Park, allowing for Pokémon from the earlier console’s games to be transferred over. Similarly, Pokémon-Amie took full advantage of the 3DS’ graphical capabilities when introducing its revolutionary new method of Pokémon interaction, and the Let’s Go games even took advantage of the Switch’s Joy-Cons to allow people to physically throw their Poké Balls. It is unclear if the Switch 2 has a similar unique feature, but if so, Gen X will undoubtedly take full advantage of it.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Teal Mask DLC Final Boss &amp; Ending Explained (In Detail)   The ending of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Teal Mask DLC features a long boss battle and special teasers for the Indigo Disk expansion.   




Additionally, the undoubtedly heightened capabilities of the Switch 2 compared to its predecessor will be more important than ever at this point in the Pokémon franchise. As entertaining as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are, the games quickly gained notoriety for performance issues, and even the more recent Teal Mask DLC has not learned from problems clear in the base games. Presumably, the Switch 2 would not have the same concerns, allowing for a far better play experience for any future titles. Moreover, assuming that the Switch 2 will allow for backward compatibility, this same upgraded hardware should also be able to stabilize Scarlet and Violet&#39;s own performance at the same time.

As it stands, although efforts have been made to improve Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to better function within the confines of the Switch’s capabilities, it is clear that the solutions have been far from perfect. For example, in order to reduce pressure on the console, Pokémon were adjusted to spawn in lower volumes across Paldea, but this led to the region seeming remarkably empty at times. Whether or not this and other knock-on effects were acceptable is a matter of personal opinion, but the entire situation made it clear that Scarlet and Violet were better suited for a system more powerful than the Nintendo Switch.






 Pokémon’s Gen 10 Will Likely Be Bigger And Better Than Any Previous Games 
         

Beyond the expected performance improvements, the possibilities for Pokémon’s Gen 10 games seem endless. A new region and new Pokémon will soon debut, most likely accompanied by a new signature gimmick to set the next era of the franchise apart from its predecessors. Any future remakes, likewise, could capitalize on the Switch 2’s capabilities in any number of ways. While this could be as simple as an updated graphical style and other minor changes, similar to as was the case with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it is also possible (albeit unlikely) for Pokémon Black and White to instead be converted into a fully open-world experience.

The Switch 2 console represents a brilliant opportunity for the Pokémon franchise to improve on a technological level. And, in turn, new Pokémon games are the perfect accompaniment to any console launch. As such, it seems extremely likely that the Switch 2, and Pokémon’s Generation 10 games, will debut together. Indicators for this being the case can be found in the strong rumors of the Switch 2 debuting next year and the coinciding gap in Pokémon games for the same timespan. Although technically circumstantial, the evidence nevertheless seems strong, suggesting that 2024 will be a very exciting year for both Pokémon and Nintendo.
