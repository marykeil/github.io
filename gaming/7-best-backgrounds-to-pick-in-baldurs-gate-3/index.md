## Literature Review

In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the best Backgrounds depend on character class. However, there are still several excellent options for all players to consider.





Baldur’s Gate 3 features eleven Backgrounds for custom characters. Each comes with two Skill Proficiencies, which improve your character’s odds in certain skill checks. Each Background also features Inspirations; essentially, making story decisions in line with your character&#39;s Background gives you Inspiration Points. These are used for re-rolls, giving you valuable second chances when you fail a roll. The best Backgrounds depend on your chosen class, so choose carefully.

By choosing the right mix of class and backgrounds in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players will be able to make roleplay and earning inspiration a breeze.












 








 7  Sage 
A Background For Students Of The Arcane
        

The Sage Background is the only Background to offer Proficiency in Arcana: an Intelligence-based skill that reflects a character’s knowledge of magic and the arcane. This can be useful for Wizard multiclass builds and is a must-have for magic caster classes such as Sorcerer and Warlock. However, there are many moments in Baldur’s Gate 3 where your party’s knowledge of magic might be tested, and successfully passing Arcana checks can open up unique choices. Unfortunately, History checks are far less common, but Sage is arguably worth picking for Arcana Proficiency alone.





 6  Soldier 
A Background For Intimidation
        

The Soldier Background combines Athletics with Intimidation. As such, it’s the ideal choice for combat-focused classes who still want the ability to excel at Charisma-based dialogue options. Characters with the Soldier Background gain extra points when threatening NPCs and benefit from Athletics if fights break out. The Soldier Background is more flexible than others since both Charisma and Strength-based classes can benefit. Charisma-based classes such as the Sorcerer and Warlock can benefit from Athletics Proficiency, a skill they wouldn’t normally have. Similarly, Strength-based classes such as Fighter and Barbarian gain Intimidation, which fits their overall class builds well.





 5  Outlander 
A Background For Wilderness Warriors
        

The Outlander Background is ideal for frontline combat classes such as Fighter, Barbarian, and Paladin. It offers proficiencies in Athletics and Survival, giving your character some benefits in and out of combat. Athletics is Strength-based and focuses on helping your character shove and resist being shoved in return. Shoving is a useful combat tactic in Baldur’s Gate 3, and a character that uses it can push enemies out of melee range or even kick them off ledges to their doom.
The Outlander Background is particularly excellent as part of a Baldur’s Gate 3 Fighter multiclass build due to its focus on Strength as a main stat.


Survival is also excellent for exploration. As you explore, you can occasionally discover mounds of dirt containing hidden treasure chests. To actually find these dirt mounds, the game automatically rolls Survival checks. With Survival Proficiency, your chances of spotting them are higher, allowing you to obtain regular drops of useful loot, including potions and new weapons.





 4  Haunted One 
An Exclusive Option For The Dark Urge Origin


 







The Haunted One Background is a unique Background that’s only available to the Dark Urge Origin. As such, you won’t be able to pick it as a custom Tav. However, it’s an incredible Background that provides unique story material, something you should consider when weighing the pros and cons of playing the Dark Urge. In summary, this Background fuels a much darker playthrough of Baldur’s Gate 3’s main story, tying you closer to the game’s villains and previous Baldur’s Gate games.
A character with the Haunted One Background suffers from urges that drive them towards dark acts, including murder, torture, and mutilation. However, you can choose whether to give in to these urges for a genuinely evil run or attempt to resist and achieve redemption. The Haunted One Background and Dark Urge Origin are great for players who want a bit more from the game, and they’re easily some of the best choices available.​​​​​​​

The Dark Urge in Baldur’s Gate 3 opens up a lot of option and details that are absent when choosing to play a custom-made character instead.



On top of that, the Haunted One Background also comes with Proficiencies in Medicine and Intimidation. Medicine is less common, but Intimidation is a common dialogue skill check.​​​​​​​





 3  Charlatan 
A Background For Expert Thieves And Liars
        

Characters with the Charlatan Background gain proficiencies in Deception and Sleight of Hand. This makes the Charlatan Background a good fit for Charisma and Dexterity-based classes such as Bard, Rogue, or Warlock. However, both Deception and Sleight of Hand are very commonly used. Whenever you can talk your way out of trouble, you will often find a Deception dialogue option. Avoiding combat by Deception is often a smart choice.
            
 
 For One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Race, Romance Is Very, Very Different 
Baldur’s Gate 3 doesn’t include every race in the Forgotten Realms, but one that made it into the game has wildly different views of romance.



The Charlatan Background also fits a remarkable number of excellent class and Background combinations due to Sleight of Hand. Sleight of Hand is used whenever your character attempts to pick locks or disarm traps, and you will have countless opportunities to do both across your entire playthrough. Gaining extra points for lockpicking and disarming helps your party obtain more rare loot and dodge otherwise deadly traps.





 2  Guild Artisan 
A Background For Smooth Talkers


 







The Guild Artisan Background is one of two Backgrounds that provide Proficiency in Insight, the other being Acolyte. However, Guild Artisan is better for almost all characters unless you’re planning a specific Cleric multiclass build, as it also offers Proficiency in Persuasion. Like Deception and Intimidation, Persuasion is a Charisma-based skill often used in dialogue options to convince NPCs to come around to your character’s way of thinking.
Proficiency in Persuasion is incredibly powerful, as you instantly gain extra points towards rolls when attempting to Persuade NPCs. It’s useful in many situations, including talking yourself out of fights, convincing NPCs to ally with you, offering rewards, and more. It’s useful for companion quests, relationships, and romances in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. You shouldn’t underestimate Insight. It’s less common but allows you to figure out another character’s true intentions without the risk associated with using the Detect Thoughts spell.





 1  Folk Hero 
A Background For Heroes


 







Folk Hero Characters gain Proficiency in Survival and Animal Handling. All magical and non-magical beasts inhabit the Sword Coast, and Animal Handling can help a character manage important encounters. This includes staring down a dangerous Owlbear and recruiting Scratch to your camp. It’s an excellent thematic choice for Druids, a character class that everyone should play once.
It’s also easy for Folk Hero characters to gain Inspiration Points, particularly in good playthroughs. The Folk Hero Background rewards Inspiration Points for most heroic acts, especially for saving innocents from danger. This makes stocking up on Inspiration Points incredibly easy, allowing you to make valuable re-rolls.
When picking a Background, it’s important to remember that although picking the best Backgrounds that match your class is highly recommended, other approaches are viable. Picking an unusual Background can give your character a more diverse skill set and potentially make your latest Baldur’s Gate 3 playthrough more interesting.
