## Literature Review

You can beat Team GO Rocket Leader Cliff in Pokémon GO easily if you pick the right line-up that is super-effective against him this January 2024.





Cliff&#39;s line-up hasn&#39;t changed in Pokémon GO since October 2023, so there won&#39;t be any surprises if you have challenged him in recent months. If you want to go on to challenge Giovanni in January 2024, you will first need to overcome Cliff&#39;s tough squad.

Cliff&#39;s line-up in Pokémon GO is the same as last month, with rare Generation 1 Pokémon Dragon-type Dratini always leading the way. He will pick one of three very different options for both of his next two choices, making each battle with Cliff very different. Cliff&#39;s second Pokémon will be one of Water- and Psychic-type Slowking, Psychic- and Flying-type Gallade, or Rock- and Grass-type Cradily. After this, Cliff will pick either Ghost-type Dusknoir, Ice- and Ground-type Mamoswine, or Rock- and Dark-type Tyranitar as his final option.



 Best Counters For Cliff In Pokémon GO (January 2024) 
          

With Cliff always starting with Dratini, it is best to lead with a Pokémon that is super effective against it, such as a Dragon-type, Ice-type, or Fairy-type. You should also include a Fighting-type Pokémon in your three. Cradily, Tyranitar, and Mamoswine are all weak to Fighting-type attacks, so using a Fighting-type such as Machamp or Lucario will give you the advantage.




A great third option is to include Gen 1 Ghost-type Gengar. It remains one of the strongest Ghost- types and is super-effective against Slowking, Gallade, and Dusknoir. Cliff is the hardest to beat out of the GO Rocket Leaders in Pokémon GO in January 2024, but there are many good options to make this easier.
