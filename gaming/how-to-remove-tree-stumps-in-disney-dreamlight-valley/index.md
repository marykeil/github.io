## Literature Review

Tree Stumps are an obstacle for players in Disney Dreamlight Valley. However, players can remove them with the help of Princess Anna.





Once you get the Shovel by completing Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s The Royal Tools quest, you will need to upgrade this tool by taking help from certain villagers. While upgrading the Shovel isn&#39;t a straightforward process, it is recommended to get this upgrade as it can also help remove other obstacles. Tree Stumps can be found in several areas and biomes, including in the starting Plaza and Peaceful Meadow areas. 




                  How To Upgrade Your Shovel In Disney Dreamlight Valley   Upgrading the shovel in Disney Dreamlight Valley requires Lion’s Claw and Old Bones which are only found in specific locations in Sunlit Plateau.

To get started with removing Tree Stumps, you must complete Anna’s Frozen-themed questline. This will require you to unlock the Frozen Realm and complete all of Princess Anna&#39;s quest. This will enable you to build a friendship with Anna, after which she can return to your village after reaching Friendship Level 2. This will unlock the &#34;An Icy Invitation&#34; quest that lets you unlock the required shovel upgrade.




Anna will tell you that she has a plan to get her sister Elsa to return to the valley and that she’s found a special place in the Forest of Valor for her to call home. However, the bridge to reach it is blocked by Tree Stumps, and she’s not sure how to remove them. Follow Anna to the bridge so you can get a better idea of what’s wrong. Anna will suggest visiting her house to pick up a book on mysterious flora that she was studying.

You can find Anna’s house in the Forest of Valor itself, and the book in question is on a table to one side of her library. If you return to Anna with the book, she will come up with the Shovel Blade shovel upgrade. You will need to collect 10 Softwood, 4 Hardwood, 4 Iron Ingots, and 3 Tinkering Parts.

Darker than Softwood.   Iron Ingots              Crafted at Crafting Station from 5 Iron Ore and 1 Coal. Mined from cliffside rocks in Forest of Valor   Tinkering Parts              3 Crafted at Crafting Station from 2 Iron Ingots   






You might want to upgrade your inventory space with extra slots so you don’t have to keep running off to sell things to Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s merchant, Goofy. A total of 30 Iron Ore is needed to produce six Iron Ingots, two of which are used to craft Tinkering Parts at a Crafting Station. Once you have collected and crafted all the required materials, you can craft the Shovel Blade and start digging up any Tree Stumps you come across.
