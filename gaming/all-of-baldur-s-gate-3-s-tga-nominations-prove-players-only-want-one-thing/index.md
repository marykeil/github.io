## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has been nominated in eight categories for The Game Awards 2023 showing that Larian&#39;s hit gives players what they want.




Baldur’s Gate 3 has been nominated for a whopping eight awards for 2023’s The Game Awards. With nominations in categories such as Best Narrative, Best RPG, and the coveted Game of the Year Award, it seems clear the impact that Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has had on the gaming world in 2023. But it is also a clearer indication of what players want and have been asking for in terms of gameplay and narrative for a long time.




Released in August 2023, Baldur’s Gate 3 is set over 120 after the events of Baldur’s Gate 2: Shadows of Amn and follows the group of adventurers after they are infected with mind flayer parasites. This is a vast oversimplification of an epic plot, and on average, it takes 100 hours to reach the end of Baldur’s Gate 3. There are numerous reasons why Baldur’s Gate 3 appeals to so many, which has propelled it to the top of many game lists.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Baldur’s Gate 3 Has A Well Executed Narrative 
Time Spend In Early Access Allowed For Fine-Tuning
         

What really makes Baldur’s Gate 3 stand out is its attention to detail, which is demonstrated throughout the game in areas such as character design and narrative. This is no doubt due to BG3 lengthy time in early access, which allowed developers Larian Studios to carefully study their player base. The result is a game with plenty of replay value, as each playthrough is impacted by the plethora of variables Larian has accounted for.






 Baldur’s Gate 3 Has Been Nominated For Eight Awards 
The Categories Show BG3’s Strengths
         

The categories Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has been nominated for are telling and go some way to explaining why it has been such a runaway success. Alongside well-deserved nominations for Best Music and Score and Best Multiplayer Game are Best Game Direction, Best Community Support, and Best Narrative. The developer&#39;s pride is clear in their posts to Larian Studios’ X account (formerly Twitter), as they list their numerous nominations while promising players more information about platform updates.

Examining Baldur’s Gate 3 closely, it is clear why it has been so successful. After almost three years in early access, it delivers exactly what its player base wants, as Larian has adapted and changed Act 1 according to their feedback. This means that the final product, and in particular Act 1, is finely-tuned and built on the foundation of observed gameplay.





 

Quests have been changed and reworked since their first iterations in early access, with some cut, some added, and others expanded on. Characters have undergone overhauls, most noticeably Shadowheart, Wyll, and Halsin, whose roles have been expanded and, in some cases, their whole personality and backstory reworked. Other key areas of the game, such as the role of the Dream Visitor, were changed from Daisy to a seducer in the final version with the Emperor.

The time spent in early access means that undoubtedly, Act 1 is the best section of Baldur’s Gate 3, having received the most attention and feedback based on player behavior. However, that’s not to say the rest of the game is lacking. Far from it, with actions taken throughout the early stages of BG3 impacting the story later down the line and making each playthrough unique.






 Respect For Player Choice Sets Baldur’s Gate 3 Apart 
Understand The Balance Between Narrative And Player Freedom
         

Baldur’s Gate 3 works so well as an RPG because it respects player agency. The game mechanics offer multiple choices to solve problems and tackle quests while providing different interactions with companions based on who happens to be in the active party at the time. The level of redundancies and fail safes in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is truly staggering, with sometimes multiple back-ups for characters or situations.

There is no better feeling for a player when playing an RPG than to have their choices respected and acknowledged. This is the core concept behind the RPG genre, but something that is unfortunately overlooked or not fully committed to by some games. Developers like Bethesda and BioWare have made their names creating in-depth RPGs packed full of lore, fantastic characters, and player choice, yet arguably, they don&#39;t hold a candle to what Larian has created with BG3.




It is a difficult balancing act to incorporate a rich narrative that still respects player choice, but when a game manages to pull it off, the results speak for themselves. Like Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout: New Vegas, and Mass Effect, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives players the freedom to simply exist in the world and fully immerse themselves in the experience: to truly roleplay.

While more single-player games in recent years have focused on creating cinematic experiences, taking the players on a thrilling but ultimately static story, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 embraces the innate chaos that comes with giving its players full agency.

                  10 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Characters You Probably Don&#39;t Know Exist   Baldur’s Gate 3 has hidden characters that generally don’t have a reason to appear in playthroughs, but specific conditions make them show up.   



 Discovery Is At The Heart Of BG3 
People Are Still Uncovering New Secrets
          




At the time of writing, Baldur’s Gate 3 has been released for a little over three months, with many players completing playthroughs in that time. However, it can be confidently said that there is no way every secret has been discovered. Just like Skyrim before it, BG3 will be a game where people will still be discovering new areas, new NPCs, and new Easter eggs years down the line.

Every playthrough is genuinely unique, as no two people will play the same class in the exact same way. Different class combinations open up new dialogue, as do race choices, giving new creative ways to solve problems. Different companions taken on different missions alter the story in subtle and surprising ways. Each romance offers a new experience and gives new viewpoints to the quests and issues facing the party.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has shown that what players want is freedom, complex narratives and to have their choices recognized and respected. BG3 has enticed a whole new audience to try CRPGs, a previously niche genre, and while the turn-based combat might not appeal to everyone, the narrative and characters have certainly won over many who were previously skeptical. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 swept the board at the Golden Joysticks Awards 2023, winning seven in total, including Ultimate Game of the Year, and many will be hoping to see a repeat of this success at The Game Awards 2023.
