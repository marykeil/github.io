# Baldur s Gate 3 Race Politics Explained (In-Depth)


## SUMMARY 



  The race of characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 affects many different situation and interactions.   Despite this, BG3 rarely gets in-depth with the Forgotten Realms&#39; lore, which is instead expounded upon in a number of Dungeons &amp; Dragons sourcebooks.   The long histories of the drow and githyanki races, for instance, are alluded to in BG3, but it&#39;s never fully explained why most other races hate or fear them.

## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 features a fraction of races seen in the Forgotten Realms, but it doesn’t fully explain the dynamics and nuances between them.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 includes a variety of races, but some of the ways they interact with each other in hostile manners don&#39;t have an immediately clear reason. Creating Tav as different races opens up the option to use race specific dialogue, but it also changes how other NPCs view the main character. However, a lot of the context as to why this is the case is found across the editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and in the changes to the Forgotten Realm over time.




Regardless of Tav&#39;s race, the views of some races in the game are shown early. Saving Shadowheart from her pod in the Nautiloid leads to her making a remark about Lae&#39;zel being a githyanki, calling her dangerous company. Act 1 also brings the party across the tiefling refugees near its beginning, which leads to information about how they&#39;re treated by the druids led by Kagha. However, these tensions and various views between the races of the Forgotten Realms are never really explained in-depth in BG3.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Depictions Of Drow As Villains 
          

Most drow are raised in the cult of Lolth, swearing to live by her virtues. They’re called Lolth-Sworn in Baldur’s Gate 3, and it’s the reason that drow are feared and hated throughout the game, whether the drow in question is Lolth-Sworn, or against Lolth as a Seladrine drow. Lolth is a cruel goddess, and she encourages that cruelty among her followers. This leads to a Lolth-Sworn Tav having dialogue options that reflect a joy in torture and cruelty, such as encouraging Kagha to kill Arabella. Since Lolth-Sworn drow see themselves as the prime race in the Underdark, they tend to enslave other inhabitants such as deep gnomes.




                  Is Minthara Worth Recruiting In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3?   Recruiting Minthara in Baldur’s Gate 3 forces you to make morally evil decisions. Is she worth the sacrifices required to bring her into the party?   

In past versions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, drow had an evil alignment by default. However, 5e has gone away from this and allows drow to have varying alignments. But that doesn&#39;t erase their history in the Forgotten Realms, and the fact that a large portion of drow in Faerûn continue following Lolth. As a result, other races automatically assume that the drow they come across serve this cruel goddess, and that leads to the hate they receive and the fear they instill.



 How Wood Elves &amp; High Elves Are Different 
          

The biggest differences between wood elves and high elves come in the form of culture, preferred environment, and innate talents, and this is reflected through the racial traits that each version has access to. Aside from showing how many other elven subraces didn&#39;t make it into Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the fifth edition Player&#39;s Handbook and Sword Coast Adventurer&#39;s Guide provide a bit more context on both high and wood elves. Although when it comes to similarities, both subraces are long-lived and proud of their specific subrace, meaning that they&#39;re insulted if somebody refers to them as the wrong subrace.




Wood elves live in secluded areas, isolated from other races, and they try to limit the effect they have on the natural world. They focus on archery and camouflage, which gives them the speed that leads to a racial trait with increased Movement Speed. Meanwhile, high elves are more civilized and willing to interact with other races. Even if they aren&#39;t wizards or sorcerers, they still have magical abilities, which is shown in their default acquisition of the firebolt cantrip.



 Why Githyanki Are Hated &amp; Often Vicious 
          

The githyanki inhabit the Astral Plane, a place where time doesn&#39;t pass. This results in long lives and the ability to hone their skills to perfection, which produces many fierce warriors due to their militaristic society and culture. However, a centerpiece of their culture is raiding the Material Planes. Mordenkainen&#39;s Tome of Foes explains that githyanki saw the other planes as their gardens, so they&#39;d raid them and take the spoils back to the Astral Plane. But they also conducted raids for the purpose of finding illithid colonies and eliminating them. As a result, their tendency to raid and pillage non-illithid colonies in the Material Planes, and their vicious and cruel methods have made them hated by other races.




                  Devora Wilde Wants Players To &#34;Give Lae&#39;zel A Chance&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Devora Wilde discusses playing githyanki companion Lae&#39;zel, the complexity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s narrative and githyanki culture clashes.    



 The Gods Of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
         

A cleric Tav has an abundance of options for gods to worship, but only a handful play a role in-game for BG3. The gods with the biggest presence are Bhaal, Selûne, Shar, and Mystra. Bane and Myrkul are mentioned as the other gods involved in the Absolute threat, but they don&#39;t have as much of a role as Bhaal. And Jergal, the former god of death, is mentioned, and might journey with the party depending on how Withers&#39; real identity in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is viewed. Lolth also gets a few mentions, but generally in the context of Lolth-Sworn drow.




Bhaal was once a mortal man, but he ascended to godhood alongside Myrkul and Bane in a strange deal with Jergal, the details of which are unknown. Meanwhile, Mystra, Selûne, and Shar were born as goddesses. Mystra is the embodiment of magic, which is why wizards hold a deep reverence for her; she is magic itself. Shar and Selûne have a more complicated relationship as twin sisters ruling over darkness and the moon, respectively. Their rivalry extends to their followers, and they often war with each other.

This can be seen in Shadowheart&#39;s comments about the ruined Selûne Temple in Act 1 and her joy at seeing it in shambles, while at the same time not wanting to linger. However, later revelations about Shadowheart&#39;s past show that Shar is petty in her fight with Selûne, and it&#39;s to the point that she would abduct a Selûnite child to turn into a Sharran in an effort to prove that darkness reigns. Aside from that, the Sharrans in Act 2 show other problematic practices, such as gouging out a man&#39;s eyes to cure him because the idea of absence is symbolic of Shar.




                  Jennifer English On How Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Shadowheart Was &#34;Her Dream Job&#34;   Jennifer English discusses playing Shadowheart in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, her love for the role, and how she found the truth behind her character.   

Both the Forgotten Realms and Faerûn have vast amounts of lore and content told through games, campaigns, and books. This makes it difficult to explain the nuances between races and gods, along with how they all interact with each other, in one piece of media, although BG3 is massive and tries to give the necessary context for the party&#39;s journey. In the end, a true understanding of the politics seen in the game and in the Forgotten Realms as a whole requires digging into content beyond Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
