## Literature Review

Weather is a feature of Sims 4: Seasons and Sims 4: Snowy Escape. Players can quickly change weather, season, and temperature with cheat codes.





Cheat codes for The Sims 4 can be used on every platform in the in-game Cheats Console. However, to change the weather with cheats, you need to own The Sims 4: Seasons. Weather effects were only introduced in the Seasons expansion, and with Seasons installed, the climate will affect your Sims&#39; moods and social lives. It&#39;s something you need to consider when building relationships between your Sims.





 How To Activate And Use Cheats In The Sims 4 
          

To open the Cheats Console in The Sims 4, you need to press several buttons or keys. The exact sequence depends on which platform you&#39;re playing on:

  PC - Left Ctrl &#43; Shift &#43; C   Mac - Command &#43; Shift &#43; C   PS4 and PS5 - L1 &#43; L2 &#43; R1 &#43;R2   Xbox - LB &#43; LT &#43; RB &#43; RT  

Once you&#39;ve pressed the right buttons, a prompt might appear, warning you that using certain cheats might disable trophies and achievements. However, if you don&#39;t mind this restriction and just want to have fun, then you can proceed.



It&#39;s always a good idea to back up your saves in a safe spot before using cheats, especially if you&#39;re using custom content.




          




A text box will appear in the upper left corner. At this stage, you can already use some basic cheats such as motherlode, although there are also honest ways to make money in The Sims 4. To get the weather cheats working, you need to type “testingcheats true” and hit enter.

You should see a short message pop up that says &#34;cheats are enabled&#34;. This allows you to use some of the game&#39;s more advanced cheat codes.



 All Weather And Weather-  Cheats In The Sims 4 
          

Before using weather cheats, make sure you have weather effects enabled in the Environment tab of the Options menu. Weather will spread out to all neighborhoods, with the exception of The Sims 4&#39;s hidden neighborhoods like Deep Woods or Sylvan Glade. To change the weather there, you will need to enter the weather cheats again inside these locations. Some maps also have permanent weather that persists even when cheats are used.

Several cheats change how your Sims react to specific types of weather, altering traits or mood, and you can even summon a lightning strike to hit a Sim. To use these cheats, grab the Sim’s in-game ID using “get_sim_id_by_name [first name] [last name]”. This gives you an ID number that you can slot into the following cheats:

 Cheat  Effect   weather.lightning_strike_object [Sim ID]  Hit the specific Sim with a lightning bolt   traits.equip_trait survivalinstinct  Complete the weather-related Aspiration at Mt. Komrebi   traits.equip_trait coldacclimation  Active Sim gains cold resistance   traits.equip_trait heatacclimation  Active Sim gains heat resistance   traits.equip_trait stormchaser  Active Sim now enjoys storms   traits.equip_trait iceman  Active Sim becomes cold immune   traits.equip_trait burningman  Active Sim becomes heat-immune   



It&#39;s worth noting that your Sims have rich inner lives in The Sims 4, with complex emotions, moods, and whims. They aren&#39;t always easy to manage, and using weather cheats can make your Sims&#39; lives and yours a bit easier overall.
