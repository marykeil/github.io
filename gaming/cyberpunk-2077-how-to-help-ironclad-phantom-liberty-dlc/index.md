## Literature Review

In Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s new Phantom Liberty DLC, you can help reprogram a desolate robot named Ironclad to free him during a hidden quest in Night City.





You might receive an incoming call from robot 1R-0NC-LAD when you visit the EBM Petrochem Station Market, a massive section of Dogtwon inside a deteriorating stadium. A series of electric sparks can be seen from a shipping container where the robot lies helpless. A small computer you can jack into, similar to a Militech data terminal in Cyberpunk 2077, may be accessed to begin the quest by deciphering Ironclad&#39;s garbled message.




                  Phantom Libertyâ€™s New Cyberpunk 2077 Ending Might Actually Be Good For V   Phantom Liberty will add a new ending to Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s base game, and there&#39;s a strong chance that it could end V&#39;s story on a good note.   


 How To Fix The Ironclad Robot in Cyberpunk 2077 (Phantom Liberty DLC) 
          

To find Ironclad, you need to find five boxes containing sofwtare parts that will help fix the robot in the shipping container. In addition to spare parts, you will also find audio logs revealing how the unfortunate robot came to be in Cyberpunk 2077. The location of these boxes will not be marked on your map, and you will instead need to use picture clues to find specific locations scattered within the Market. 

  Parts Container   How to Find   Map Image    Box #1   Travel up some stairs to the upper shops of the Market. You will find this box with a yellow exclamation point next to the Butcher vendor almost immediately to your right.                           Box #2   Past the Butcher shop, keep traveling until you see the M.D. medical place to your left across another railing. The box sits on top of other containers labeled &#34;Trauma Team,&#34; which are bright green.                           Box #3   Go down from the general walkways and head toward a Weapon shop in the Market&#39;s center. Look inside the Militech boxes surrounding the vendor until you find the parts needed for Ironclad.                           Box #4   Travel into the largest weapon store in the area, which should have multiple tables with guns in teal light. Near the back, head into the left corner of the room to find the necessary software data tucked away past some other containers.                           Box #5   At the very edge of the Market, past a car vendor and an exposed tank, go to a small restaurant with a yellow sign and three lanterns down a set of stairs leading to the bottom of the region. The box is tucked to the right side of the NPC serving food.                          






Once you have found all software parts and seen their logs, return to the Shipping Container with Ironclad inside and upload the data to the computer next to them. You will have three choices that will let you wipe Ironclad&#39;s memory, leave them be, or reprogram the robot to give them a new function. You can only reprogram Ironclad if you have a high enough Intelligence stat, which could be raised via Perk upgrades in Cyberpunk 2077.

Reprogramming Ironclad is the best way to help the robot in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC, making them a master with the guitar for some sweet tunes as a small reward for your kindness.
