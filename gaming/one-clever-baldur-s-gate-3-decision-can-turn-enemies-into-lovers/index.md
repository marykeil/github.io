## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has some particularly hostile relationships, but the right trick can quickly turn things in the opposite direction altogether.




The vastly different personalities of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 companions are the perfect recipe for some serious tensions among party members, but it&#39;s possible to kindle romance between the most unlikely of characters despite their typical frostiness. The biggest divides between characters in the game tend to come as a result of disparate cultural values or outlooks on morality, building on the traditional races, backgrounds, and alignments of Dungeons &amp; Dragons while allowing for some growth and flexibility. From Karlach&#39;s fundamental optimism to Astarion&#39;s penchant for flippant cruelty, the party has the perfect dose of dysfunction that seems to be a crucial adventuring recipe.




The most openly hostile party relationship is the one between Shadowheart and Lae&#39;zel, who trade barbs and looks of disdain throughout plenty of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 scenes. Although they&#39;re similar in some ways — both offering unswerving allegiance to harsh goddesses — these allegiances push them in different directions overall. The biggest sticking point in the early parts of the story is the mysterious artifact in Shadowheart&#39;s possession. Lae&#39;zel believes it needs to be taken to the Githyanki Crèche in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, while Shadowheart is on a mission to deliver it safely to the city of Baldur&#39;s Gate.

 Lae&#39;zel And Shadowheart Can Have A BG3 Romance 
          




The secret to fostering a connection between Lae&#39;zel and Shadowheart is actually simple — playing as Lae&#39;zel and focusing on romancing Shadowheart in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Although winning over companions requires the protagonist to at least occasionally act in accordance with their beliefs, they&#39;re unnaturally prone to falling for the de facto party leader. Having the main character advantage makes it easier to reconcile even the harshest relationships, and the ability to play as any of the central Origin characters instead of a custom Tav opens up a number of doors that might otherwise be locked.

Although romantic opportunities aren&#39;t likely to arise without this technique, Lae&#39;zel and Shadowheart don&#39;t have to remain enemies even in a campaign where neither is chosen as the playable character. Both have some important realizations to confront over the course of the story, and their arcs of personal growth can help them see past their initial differences in favor of the party&#39;s common goal. Just how successful this reconciliation will be can depend on various choices made throughout Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but their general path has a tendency to smooth over their harshest oppositions.

Whether driving the relationship progress by playing as Lae&#39;zel or Shadowheart or simply spectating from the sidelines, watching interpersonal relationships grow and evolve is a particularly engaging part of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. These two companions serve as one example of why giving Lae&#39;zel a chance and keeping all the party members around is usually a good idea, as writing off a character due to negative first impressions can lose out on a lot of interesting material. Lae&#39;zel and Shadowheart might seem destined to hate each other in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but with the right approach, they can walk away from the adventure holding each other&#39;s hands.
