## Literature Review

Players looking for new missions or rewards in Honkai: Star Rail might need to find an NPC named Yujin, who can be tricky to find in the larger world.





The first time you will hear about Yujin is through a daily quest called a Navigation Compass mission, which differs slightly from the main story quests or side content. Typically indicated on your map, Compass missions are puzzles that change almost daily in Honkai: Star Rail. These mini-quests are often restricted by a time limit you must follow to collect valuable resources as rewards.

 How To Find Yujin 
          

Yujin can be found in Xianzhou Luofu at the Cloudbreadth Sleeves shop, a place located in the southwest corner of the Central Starskiff Haven area. exploration in this Honkai: Star Rail region starts when you activate the Starwatcher Avenue fast travel point in the city. Try to meet Handian, the Pawnbroker, and the Strale Merchant in this zone since these NPCs are fairly close to Yujin&#39;s store.

Look for the person dressed in green to identify Yujin, who will ask you if you can help a teacher with an errand once you start talking to them. A Navigation Compass Timetable mission named &#34;That Teacher&#34; has you searching for Clothes to deliver back to Yujin. Taking the quest item back to the store will give you a ton of excellent rewards, so you should start this small quest as soon as you discover where Yujin is in Honkai: Star Rail.

Once you return to Yujin, they will give you 20 Strale, 30 Stellar Jade, and Ascension Materials in the form of the Thief&#39;s Steel Grappling Hook and a Thief&#39;s Myriad-Faced Mask. However, the most important reward is the premium Stellar Jade currency in Honkai: Star Rail, a rare resource. You can spend Stellar Jade on Star Rail Passes in the game&#39;s main Store or Warp menu.
