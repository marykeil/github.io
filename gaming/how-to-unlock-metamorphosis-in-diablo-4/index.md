## Literature Review

One of the Vampiric Powers you can unlock in Season 2 of Diablo 4 is called Metamorphosis, an ability that transforms your character in battle.





Metamorphosis is a Level 3 Vampiric Power in Diablo 4 that causes your character to turn into bats when you use the Evade skill at any time. This universal escaping mechanic is usually very quick, but this trait causes it to last for an astonishing 4 seconds as you move around as a cloud of bats. You also become Unstoppable during this state and can damage enemies that you come in contact with.






Any enemy that takes damage from your bat form in Metamorphosis is also afflicted with Vampiric Curse, a condition that stores up charges of souls when you defeat enemies before discharging into extra damage when you use class skills.

 How To Get Metamorphosis Vapiric Power In Diablo 4 
          

You get the Metamorphosis Power in Diablo 4 by completing the &#34;A Serpent Cornered&#34; quest in the Season of Blood story. This mission has your character travel to the Fractured Peaks, the Darkened Waynortheast in Yelesna. An area named the City of the Ancients will be marked on your map, where you&#39;ll meet up with the NPC Erys to track down and defeat the boss, Lord Zir, deep in the ruined location.




Even when you receive Metamorphosis as a reward for finishing the quest, you must have the right Armor Pacts to use the power properly. Certain gear pieces that drop in Diablo 4&#39;s Season 2 have Pacts associated with them, divided between Ferocity, Divinity, and Eternity categories. You need two of each Pact category on your character&#39;s Armor to use Metamorphosis during your adventures in Sanctuary.

Once you have met the right Activation Cost with a certain character, it does not matter what class you&#39;re playing to use this Vampiric Power. Unlike the previous Season&#39;s additional skills, these traits are available for anyone to use as long as you meet the requirements in Diablo 4.

The ability provided by unlocking Metamorphosis in Diablo 4 will help those trying to take on the harder enemies seen in the Season of Blood.
