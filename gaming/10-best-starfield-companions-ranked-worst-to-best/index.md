## Literature Review

The universe in Starfield has over 20 companion options, but selecting which to traverse the cosmos with may be a rather hard decision.




Starfield is an enormous game with over 1000 planets, 100 star systems, and, most importantly, a plethora of character options and customizations. Whether it&#39;s crafting bespoke weapons, tuning up the ideal ship, or hiring companions and crew members, Starfield allows players to tailor their experience. Perhaps one of the most significant customization options is the ability to pick and choose which companions will join the crew, and which will accompany the player character, during their exciting adventure.
With over 20 companions to choose from in Starfield, the game offers a great deal of choice when it comes to picking who will accompany the crew on their intergalactic journey. Notably, there are three types of companions in Starfield: Constellation companions, Secondary companions, and Hired companions, all of which have differing levels of backstory, requirements, and, most importantly, practical application. Companions and crew members are a huge part of the Starfield experience, with each imbuing a unique experience through their own interesting viewpoints, insights, likes, dislikes, and opinions.
            
 
 Starfield Companions: Can You Recruit The Hunter As A Crew Member? 
There are over 20 potential companions who can join the player in Starfield, but can one of the game&#39;s coolest-looking characters be recruited?












 








 10  Dani Garcia Is A Good Crewmate, But Lacks Personality 
Hired In Neon
        

Dani Garcia is a researcher and engineer with a soft spot for robots. Located in Neon, Dani is a decent companion but not a great option when compared with others. She is fairly useful, with a two-star rating in Robotics, a one-star rating in Chemistry, and a one-star rating in Energy Weapon Systems. However, while inoffensive, Dani lacks an interesting backstory or personality. Ultimately, Dani is better than most other Hired companions, but essentially forgettable. She has a place on the player character&#39;s ship, but isn&#39;t the best when it comes to off-world adventuring.





 9  Amelia Earhart Provides A Unique Historical Perspective 
Requires Completion Of &#34;Operation Starseed&#34; On Charybdis III
        

Born in 1897, Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, a feat she accomplished in 1937. Today, she is best remembered for her mysterious disappearance, an end she met with during another attempted marvel of aviation: the first circumnavigation of the globe by a plane. It may be surprising, therefore, that a pioneer of early air travel like Earhart would be a candidate for companionship in the year 2330.
Although she may not be the most useful companion in Starfield, Earhart is certainly a fun partner, and with skills (appropriately) allocated to piloting, she is not the worst companion choice in the game. Earhart has two stars each in Piloting and Rifle Certification. That makes her a good candidate for a ship&#39;s crew, but not ideal for on-foot travel.
            
 
 Why Starfield Needs More Quests Like Operation Starseed 
Operation Starseed is one of Starfield’s best quests, and it’s not even close. Here’s why this one is built different, and what others are lacking.








 8  Lin Is An Underrated Companion Choice 
Requires Completion Of &#34;Back To Vectera&#34; On Vectera
        

Along with Heller, Lin is the first character met during the story. She&#39;s responsible for training the player character as an employee of Argos Extractors, a confident leader and a Colony War vet. She is also a pretty underrated recruitable companion. Available to recruit following the completion of the &#34;Back to Vectera&#34; mission, Lin is a tough, no-nonsense companion and competent engineer. She has one star in Demolition and three in Outpost Engineering, making her very useful when assigned to an outpost. She may be a great option early in the game, but is fairly one-dimensional compared to other potential Starfield companions.





 7  Gideon Aker Is Expensive, But Worth It 
Hired In New Atlantis
        

As a crewmate, Gideon Aker&#39;s most useful application comes from his ballistics and missile weapon systems expertise: he has two stars in each. He can be found at The Viewport bar in New Atlantis, and although he is rather expensive at a hiring fee of 16,500 Credits, he is certainly worth the investment - especially if the character can pass the persuasion check and lower his fee. However, like most hirable companions, he lacks a distinct personality.





 6  Barrett Balances Skill And Charisma 
Automatically Recruited During &#34;Back To Vectera&#34;
        

Barrett is the first member of Constellation met during a playthrough in Starfield, automatically joining the crew during the &#34;Back to Vectera&#34; mission. He has a deeply fleshed-out personality and backstory, and excellent skills: four stars in Starship Engineering, three in Particle Beam Weapon Systems, two in Robotics, and one in Gastronomy.
Barret is a solid option for any placement, and can even hold his own when adventuring. He&#39;s a scientist and explorer, with an adventurous and fairly stubborn personality. For the most part, he is generally endearing and supportive. Furthermore, Barrett is one of Starfield&#39;s romance options, so fans of his eccentricity can put a ring on it.





 5  Sarah Morgan Is A Paragon Of Virtue 
Automatically Recruited During &#34;Old Neighborhood&#34;


 







Sarah Morgan automatically joins the crew during the &#34;Old Neighborhood&#34; mission; the player character can&#39;t get rid of her until they complete it. She is the de facto Chair of Constellation and therefore, bombarded by responsibility. However, that&#39;s made her a capable leader, with four stars in Astrodynamics, three in Lasers, two in Leadership, and one in Botany.
Sarah is a prototypical lawful good character. Consequently, she&#39;s not a great choice for those who plan on pillaging and thieving across the universe. However, for those who play with even a modicum of morality, Sarah is an excellent candidate for a companion. Furthermore, she is one of four companion characters whom the player character can choose to marry in Starfield.





 4  Andromeda Kepler Has An Interesting Backstory 
Hired In Cydonia
        

Andromeda Kepler has one of the more interesting backstories among Starfield&#39;s non-romanceable companions. She&#39;s an aspiring author, writing a book about the relationship between science and religion in the universe of Starfield.
Kepler can be located at the Broken Spear bar in the Mars colony of Cydonia. She will join the crew on their adventure for a modest fee of 12,000 credits, which can be halved if the player is particularly persuasive. As for what she brings to the table, she has two stars in Outpost Engineering, one in Piloting, and one in Aneutronic Fusion, making her well-placed on a ship or a colony.





 3  Omari Hassan Is An Excellent Crewmate 
Hired In Akila
        

Omari Hassan is a hirable companion who can be found seeking employment at The Hitching Post in Akila. Although he demands a reasonably high hiring price of 15,000 credits, Omari&#39;s defensive skills make him a boon to any starship crew. He has three stars in Shield Systems and two in Starship Engineering.
Like most Hired companions, Omari&#39;s backstory is fairly limited, but he does make it clear that he is searching for his family out among the stars. He may not be a personality hire, but Omari&#39;s defensive abilities speak for themselves. Having him on board can improve the efficiency of shields and boost ship defense, allowing the ship to take less damage.





 2  Andreja Excels At Stealth, With A Great Backstory 
Recruited Automatically During &#34;Unknown&#34;


 







Andreja is undoubtedly one of the best companions in Starfield. Joining the crew automatically during the &#34;Unknown&#34; mission, Andreja has the highest Stealth skill of any companion at four stars - an enormous plus to keeping her around. She also boasts three stars in Particle Beams, two in Energy Weapons, and one in Stealth.
Beyond her sneakier applications, Andreja has an intriguing backstory made even more interesting due to her aloof, secretive, and mysterious personality. Although Andreja is hard to get to know, she will open up more the longer she and the player character travel together. A deeply conflicted person, torn by her morality, Andreja is one of Starfield&#39;s four marriage candidate companions.





 1  Sam Coe Is A Cowboy With A Heart Of Gold 
Recruited Automatically During &#34;Empty Nest&#34;


 







The space cowboy Sam Coe is one of Starfield&#39;s most complex characters. He joins the crew automatically during the &#34;Empty Nest&#34; mission, but his true complexity isn&#39;t revealed until the character gets to know him a little better. Although he is, at times, excessively reckless and adventurous, he is a charming rogue with a keen sense of morality and responsibility. He can pull his weight in any placement, with four stars in Piloting, three in Rifle Certification, two in Payloads, and one in Geology.
Sam has a touching backstory, particularly regarding his daughter and family, which certainly contributes to his lovable personality. He&#39;s got a deep family history as a descendant of Solomon Coe, founder of the Freestar Collective. Furthermore, Sam is one of the game&#39;s four marriage candidates, so fans of the intrepid space cowboy can take their relationship to the next level.
While not all companions are created equal, each of them brings something to the table. Some of them are best suited to particular purposes, but players are best off with a well-rounded roster of companions with a variety of different skills. Knowing who to bring along when, and who to leave on the ship is the key to success in Starfield.
