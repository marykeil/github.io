# Youre About To Find Out How Much You Actually Suck At Diablo 4


## SUMMARY 



  Diablo 4 introduces the Abattoir of Zir event, a challenging gameplay experience that addresses complaints about the game being too easy. With 25 tiers of increasing difficulty, it will be an incredibly tough challenge for players.   The Abattoir of Zir focuses on scaling enemy health rather than damage, making it difficult to progress. Even the most optimized character builds in Diablo 4 are expected to struggle.   While no character may be able to finish the event upon its release, those who can successfully take on Nightmare Dungeon Tier 100&#39;s elite enemies should have a chance.

## Literature Review

Diablo 4 is adding a new event, and this one is designed to be impossible to finish at release, meaning itâ€™ll challenge even the best players.




Diablo 4 has an upcoming Abattoir of Zir event, which is similar in concept to the Greater Rifts from its predecessor, Diablo 3. The Abattoir of Zir features 25 tiers to fight through, with each tier scaling higher in difficulty. At release, the Abattoir of Zir event difficulty scales higher than even Nightmare Dungeon Tier 100, meaning that this is going to present an incredibly tough challenge.




In its present state, complaints about Diablo 4 include that it&#39;s too easy and does not give the community the challenge they crave. However, adding the Abattoir of Zir event to the game intends to change this and address that complaint. This will also mean that it&#39;ll be a real skill check for anybody who wants to take on this challenge, as even the most optimized and best character builds in Diablo 4 are meant to struggle.

                  BlizzCon 2023 Diablo 4 Interview: Joe Piepiora And Tiffany Wat   Two of the biggest names behind Diablo 4 discuss what is coming up with the Vessel of Hatred expansion, Abattoir of Zir, Midwinter Blight, &amp; Season 3.   


 Diablo 4&#39;s Abattoir Of Zir Is Meant To Be Impossible To Finish 
         

A Diablo 4 content creator, Wudijo, had the opportunity to play test Abattoir of Zir during Blizzcon, and he then shared information about it on his YouTube channel. He spoke about various features that are in the event, and what specifically makes it so difficult. According to Wudijo, the damage from enemies doesn&#39;t scale as much, so the main factor that makes it hard to progress to the end is the amount of health enemies have as the difficulty scales. Additionally, the enemy level for this event will go beyond Level 154, which is the current maximum for Nightmare Dungeons.




                  10 Best Changes In Diablo 4 Patch 1.2 (Season Of Blood)   Diablo 4 is making lots of changes to both gameplay mechanics and exciting content with Patch 1.2 alongside its vampiric new Season of Blood.   



 The Most Optimized Builds Will Struggle In Abattoir Of Zir 
          

Right now, the classes that top the leaderboards are Hammer of the Ancients Barbarians and Ball Lightning Sorcerers, who benefit from the Gravitational Aspect in Diablo 4. According to Wudijo, nobody is meant to be able to finish Abattoir of Zir when it first releases, as far as he&#39;s aware. However, he believes that characters who can successfully take on Nightmare Dungeon Tier 100&#39;s elite enemies should be okay in this event. But that&#39;s not to say that even those characters will make it to the end right away.





 

Despite its criticisms when it was released, the Greater Rifts added to Diablo 3 much later ended up being a feature that was enjoyed by the community overall. The scaling difficulty made them worth doing repeatedly, and not every run through a Greater Rift was exactly the same. Now, a similar feature is being added to its successor that should make it hard to continue making any complaints about the difficulty being too easy in Diablo 4.



Diablo 4 is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.
