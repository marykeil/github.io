## Literature Review

Nourishing Extract is a material in Monster Hunter World that can be used to create some of the most helpful consumable items for a hunt.





The primary way of gathering Nourishing Extract is by hunting Odogaron, Dodogama, and Paolumu. Each of these monsters has a chance to drop the material as a hunt reward. Breaking parts and capturing do not increase these rates. Hunters should focus on completing quests and investigations that feature any of these three monsters. Crafting Ancient Potions, Mega Demondrugs, and Mega Armorskins is extremely beneficial for challenging hunts, such as defeating a Black Diablos in Monster Hunter World.




                  How to Find (&amp; Defeat) The Rathalos in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne   Rathalos is one of the iconic monsters from the Monster Hunter series. Here&#39;s where players can find and defeat it in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.

When looking for quests to farm Nourishing Extract, you will not find better than the event &#34;A Rush of Blood.&#34; During this Hunt, you will face two Odogaron in the arena. However, the second target will be much larger than the first. Hunters shouldn&#39;t have much trouble defeating these foes as the quest has a minimum requirement of HR 13.

A Voucher can be used to increase the amount of rewards obtained at the end. A demonstration of this event and where to access the quest is detailed by MAR 88 on YouTube.





 



Odogaron is primarily weak to the Ice and Thunder damage. Utilize weapons with these Elements to quickly clear the event.




Hunters can also forgo obtaining Nourishing Extract in Monster Hunter World and obtain Demondrugs or Armorskins instead. These are only slightly less effective than their Mega counterparts and much easier to acquire. Request that the Argosy goes out to sea and brings back only Consumable goods.

This is a nice way to passively earn items, as the Argosy finishes one trade after each quest. Unfortunately, the desired consumables are not guaranteed when the Argosy returns. Alternatively, Hunters who have progressed far enough in the Iceborne expansion can obtain Mega Demondrugs and Mega Armorskins guaranteed.




Speak to the Elder Melder and you can create the consumables without the need to craft. Each Mega Demondrug or Mega Armorskin costs 80 points. These can be earned by trading in materials or event tickets. Similarly, Ancient Potions can be earned randomly by using The Steamworks in Seliana.

Consumables can make or break a tough fight. Hunters should always be prepared before embarking on a quest. Utilize the Elder Melder and The Steamworks to obtain valuable items. Hunters looking for a challenge should try the hardest event quests in Monster Hunter World.
