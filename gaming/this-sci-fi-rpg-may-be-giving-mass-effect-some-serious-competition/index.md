# This Sci-Fi RPG May Be Giving Mass Effect Some Serious Competition


## SUMMARY 



  Exodus, developed by Archetype Entertainment, is poised to rival the beloved Mass Effect series.   The similarities between Mass Effect and Exodus are apparent, with both games featuring third-person gameplay, squad mates, futuristic tech, cosmic mysteries, and interstellar politics.   Exodus has an intriguing setting that may rival Mass Effect&#39;s, taking place in the far future where humanity has settled in the Centauri Cluster and undergone transhuman evolution via genetic modification.

## Literature Review

The long-awaited return of Mass Effect is still a long ways away, but another sci-fi RPG on the horizon might make the wait more bearable.




The continuation of the beloved Mass Effect series is highly anticipated, but another upcoming science fiction RPG, Exodus, might be coming for BioWare&#39;s throne. Developed by Archetype Entertainment, a division of Wizards of the Coast, Exodus was one of the many big announcements at The Game Awards 2023, introduced live on stage by Matthew McConaughey, who is set to voice a character in the title. The actor&#39;s involvement is enough to pique interest, but a number of other factors in both Exodus&#39; and the untitled Mass Effect&#39;s development will see the two in direct competition.




The superficial similarities between Mass Effect and Exodus are plain to see. A handful of glimpses at Exodus&#39; gameplay reveal that it&#39;s played from a third-person perspective, and hint that there will be squad mates who accompany the player character as they battle a variety of organic and synthetic enemies. Distinctly futuristic tech, cosmic mysteries, and esoteric interstellar politics abound in each, and although Archetype Entertainment is so far untested, there&#39;s plenty to be excited about from the little that&#39;s already known of Exodus. The original Mass Effect trilogy has been the gold standard of sci-fi RPGs for over a decade, but Exodus appears to be cut from the same cloth, and could provide another high-water mark.

 Exodus&#39; Development Team Includes Former BioWare Devs 
          




Many worries over the future of Mass Effect revolve around the personnel at BioWare. While a number of Mass Effect devs returned for the Legendary Edition remasters of the original trilogy, BioWare is generally considered to be far past its golden age, when it was regularly releasing acclaimed RPGs like the first two Baldur&#39;s Gate titles, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and the Dragon Age series. The failure of Anthem in 2019 in particular seems to have resulted in an exodus from the developer&#39;s studios. While talent comes and goes regularly in the industry, some notable former BioWare developers have landed at Archetype, and are seemingly the architects behind Exodus.

When Wizards of the Coast founded Archetype Entertainment in 2019 – at the time unnamed – with the goal of creating games with new IP separate from its Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic: The Gathering brands, James Ohlen was brought in as the studio&#39;s head. Ohlen is in part responsible for BioWare&#39;s early success, serving as lead designer for Baldur&#39;s Gate (and Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 and Neverwinter Nights). His illustrious design track record would continue with Star Wars: KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, before helping establish BioWare&#39;s studio in Austin, Texas, which developed the still-successful MMORPG, Star Wars: The Old Republic.




While Ohler&#39;s design pedigree is certainly promising for Exodus, perhaps the most consequential hire Archetype Entertainment has made is Drew Karpyshyn, whose first role at BioWare was serving as a senior writer for KOTOR. While a number of DnD games are notable additions to Karpyshyn&#39;s resume as well, most pertinent to his work on the upcoming Exodus is his role as lead writer for the original Mass Effect and its first sequel, Mass Effect 2. KOTOR, many of BioWare&#39;s DnD games, and Mass Effect are known for their incredible amounts of writing, and with Karpyshyn attached, Exodus seems poised to deliver deep character and world development.



 Exodus Already Has A Fascinating Setting To Rival Mass Effect&#39;s 
         

Much of Mass Effect&#39;s appeal is its well-realized, intricate, interstellar setting, which especially helps the first game and its notably clunky gameplay. The setting itself does a lot of heavy lifting for Mass Effect&#39;s roleplaying mechanics, inundating players with in-universe factions, organizations, conflicts, and politics, upon which the games&#39; many missions are built. While much still remains unknown about Exodus&#39; story and gameplay, its reveal trailer (via Archetype Entertainment&#39;s YouTube channel) and the official Exodus website already give an enticing look into its setting.





 

Whereas Mass Effect has humanity rapidly propelled into an interstellar age because of the discovery of alien technology, Exodus takes place in the far future, where humankind has abandoned a dying Earth many millennia prior to the game taking place. Ark ships carrying the vestiges of the human race reach the Centauri Cluster roughly 16,000 light years from Earth (perhaps based on the real-life Omega Centauri cluster, 17,090 light years away) around the year 18,000 CE. What follows is tens of thousands of years of transhuman evolution propelled by genetic engineering, resulting in disparate, distantly related species collectively known as Celestials.

While interstellar Celestial empires are rising and falling amid numerous wars – most notably the Formation Wars circa 28,000 CE, &#34;obliterating hundreds of habitable worlds across the Cluster,&#34; according to the Exodus site – humans are still trickling in from their long voyages, forced to colonize humble, rudimentary worlds compared to the technological grandeur of Celestial societies. In the aftermath of the Formation Wars, the most prominent of these Celestial societies, built by a species known as the Elohim, rises to power and connects all the Centauri Cluster via the Gates of Heaven – technology akin to Mass Effect&#39;s Mass Relays.




The Gates usher in unprecedented exploration and trade, and even millennia after the Elohim fade from prominence, the species&#39; fate a mystery, their empire&#39;s absolute laws against destroying habitable worlds are obeyed. Players will step into the world of Exodus over 10,000 years after the rise of the Elohim, taking up the mantle of Jun Aslan, a human-Celestial hybrid and heir to the Aslan Dynasty, a human empire born from a moon called Lidon, which was removed from its home system and placed into orbit around a gas giant by the Elohim. The most immediate threats appear to be a &#34;Celestial techno-virus known as the Rot&#34; threatening Lidon&#39;s habitability, and a half-brother who&#39;s usurped control of the Aslan Dynasty.

Much of Exodus&#39; planet-hopping gameplay will seemingly be a consequence of Jun&#39;s role as a Traveler – &#34;a hunter of secrets and alien technology&#34; in the interest of advancing their home civilization. Jun has the unique ability to interact with technology created by Celestials, and the prominence of the Elohim in the game&#39;s backstory suggests they (and their disappearance) will likely be a significant narrative hook. The Exodus website offers a number of short stories and videos to accompany this foundational storytelling as well, and Archetype Entertainment appears poised to gradually reveal more about the setting it&#39;s created.






Much like its backstory, Exodus appears to take place over many years, perhaps centuries. The player character will suffer the effects of time dilation while traveling near light speed: &#34;days for [Jun] will be decades, or even centuries back home,&#34; according to Exodus&#39; website.






 Exodus May Release Before The Next Mass Effect 
          

While the success of Exodus isn&#39;t assured, it does have the immediate benefit of being more tangible than the next Mass Effect title. BioWare is currently occupied with Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&#39;s development, and the untitled Mass Effect has only received a few teaser images and trailers – nothing substantial. Although Mass Effect is beloved, the series&#39; last outing, Mass Effect: Andromeda, is widely considered its worst entry by quite a wide margin. Reviving a long-dormant series is a tall order, and if Exodus turns out to be the competition it seems to be, it could dampen Mass Effect&#39;s hopefully triumphant return.




An announcement at The Game Awards via a trailer containing both narrative and gameplay content (albeit only snippets of the latter) suggests Exodus will arrive first, though no release window has been given. There&#39;s certainly room for two sci-fi RPG epics, and one certainly won&#39;t take away from the merits of the other, but they&#39;re bound to be compared. The already intricate world building and implied vastness of its setting seem to place Exodus in direct competition with Mass Effect, and both will certainly be worth keeping an eye on.
