## Literature Review

Beating the game in Super Mario RPG doesn’t mean the fun has to end, with seven bosses available to fight again in even more challenging forms.




The remake of Super Mario RPG is not a very long game by today&#39;s standards, but things don&#39;t actually end when many might think they do after the final battle. One of the biggest alterations between the original title from 1996 and the new 2023 remake of Super Mario RPG is the addition of new post-game content. This gives Mario and his friends an additional challenge of rematches against seven of the bosses in the game, but, of course, now they are much more powerful in preparation for their second chance at victory.
[Warning: The following article contains post-game spoilers for Super Mario RPG.]
As would be expected, in order to unlock these extra challenging rematches, players must beat the game and receive the explanation from Toad that the adventure isn&#39;t actually over, but that Mario gets a free night stay at the Marrymore Inn. During that stay, Geno will be seen gazing out the window where he receives the inspiration that they must travel to a certain area. A bit of questing will follow, which will ultimately lead the party to several of the bosses for new fights. The Frog Sage will give instructions on which enemy to go to, but most of these bosses can be faced in any order.

Super Mario RPG brings the fan-favorite classic back with welcome bells and whistles, inspiring players young and old to rediscover this Mario curio.












 








 7  Scratchy-Throat Belome 
Provides Mallow&#39;s Ultimate Weapon
        

Battling Belome for the third time is a bit more difficult, especially as Belome begins the fight with 4,600 HP, but if the party comes out victorious, he will drop the Sage Stick as a reward. The Sage Stick is Mallow&#39;s ultimate weapon in Super Mario RPG, possibly belonging to his grandpa, and provides an increase to both his magic and physical strength. Belome doesn&#39;t go down easily or quickly, and it can be a long battle, but he is weak to Lightning which can help, and gives Mallow a chance to really shine before getting his reward.





 6  Engine 023 Booster 
Provides Geno&#39;s Ultimate Weapon
        

In the post-game of Super Mario RPG, Booster is waiting at the top of Booster Tower for a second fight against Mario and his friends. This can be a fairly difficult fight, with three minions to deal with, in addition to Booster.
Booster was never an actual boss fight but only a minor antagonist in the original version of Super Mario RPG. 

Many of Booster&#39;s moves are spent trying to summon his new train, Engine 023, which is incredibly powerful if he is successful in getting it prepared. As long as players can continue to interrupt Booster to prevent the train from appearing, things are not too bad, but Engine 023 will quickly pulverize the entire party if it&#39;s summoned. Once the fight is over, Booster drops the Stella 023, which is a perfect weapon for Geno.
            
 
 10 Biggest Changes In Super Mario RPG From The Original 
The remake of the Super Mario RPG is pretty close to the original, but there are still several changes and updates that have been made to it.








 5  Extra-Fancy Bundt 
Provides The Enduring Brooch Accessory


 







Although the Bundt boss is still not a bundt cake, but more of a fancy wedding cake, the Extra-Fancy Bundt is larger and more difficult than the first time around, with strong area of effect attacks. During the battle, candles will slowly become lit on the top of the cake, and after all the candles are shining brightly, the party will be hit by an incredibly overpowered Celebration Shot attack that can easily wipe out everyone. If the party is successful in defeating the Extra-Fancy Bundt in Super Mario RPG, they get the reward of The Enduring Brooch, which is an accessory that can keep a character from dying once per battle. 





 4  Leveled-Up Punchinello 
Provides Bowser&#39;s Ultimate Weapon
        

This leveled-up version of Punchinello for the post-game rematch in Super Mario RPG has a lot of defenses to protect him. It can be a long battle, but if the characters can time their attacks right, they can make the Bob-ombs that Punchinello sends out turn around and hit him instead, although this will still take several hits before seeing much of a result. Once Punchinello admits defeat, however, the resulting prize is that he will then upgrade Bowser&#39;s Chain Chomp into a special golden version called the Wonder Chomp.





 3  Duel-Ready Johnny 
Provides The Extra-Shiny Stone Needed To Rematch Culex


 







At the Pirate Headquarters underwater, Johnny is ready for Mario to come approach him for a rematch in the post-game of Super Mario RPG. This fight is similar to the first time, where it is only Mario and Johnny with no additional party members present, setting the mood for a proper pirate duel. Unlike before, however, Mario is not permitted to use any items during the fight, including anything to provide healing. Once Mario is triumphant, Johnny will provide him with the Extra-Shiny Stone which is needed in order to achieve the final rematch with Culex.





 2  Mario-Style Jinx 
Provides The Teamwork Band Accessory
        

Defeating Jinx in the post-game is optional, but he does give The Teamwork Band as a reward, which increases the speed that the Action Gauge fills up. Jinx is found inside Monstro Town, and has very high standards that he will hold the party to. If any Action Command is failed at any time in the battle, Jinx will use his Silver Bullet attack, which will cause an immediate KO and instant death.
It is helpful to equip The Enduring Brooch which is obtained by defeating Extra-Fancy Bundt to help prevent the instant death from Jinx&#39;s Silver Bullet. 

Ultimately, Jinx wants to see a Triple Move in Super Mario RPG&#39;s post-game rematch, and as soon as a Triple Move is successfully accomplished, the battle will end. Sadly, this is easier said than done, and can take many tries or a lot of luck to pull off.
            
 
 Super Mario RPG’s Hidden Boss Explained 
Super Mario RPG actually includes a secret superboss, and a powered-up version who can only be fought after beating the game. Here’s how to find them.








 1  Culex 3D 
Super Mario RPG&#39;s Hardest Boss


 







Attempting to battle Culex 3D is the ultimate challenge in the game, as he is designed to be a fierce opponent. In this new 3D form, Culex has a staggering 9,999 HP and four Crystals. This fight has many different attacks that will hit multiple party members, and each time a Crystal is destroyed it will provide a buff to the remaining Crystals. Culex 3D is by far the most difficult boss fight in all of Super Mario RPG and once completed, Mario and his party, and the player controlling them, all deserve a round of applause.
