## Literature Review

The final boss of Alan Wake 2 tests everything you&#39;ve learned as you must beat Scratch, an evil creature of darkness whose corruption must be stopped.





From this point on, expect heavy spoilers for the ending sections of Alan Wake 2.




Scratch has possessed Alan Wake for this battle as you play as Inspector Saga, who originally came to the town of Bright Falls to solve a series of ritualistic murders. Make sure to stock up on ammo for the powerful weapons of Alan Wake 2 to prepare for this fight. You&#39;ll need practically every bullet or Crossbow bolt to fend off Scratch as the shadow being fights ferociously to obtain the Clicker, which could supposedly destroy the shadows corrupting the town.

                  &#34;Remedy&#39;s Magnum Opus&#34;: Alan Wake 2 Review   Alan Wake 2 is a mind-bending, epic thriller that takes the best of Remedyâ€™s catalogue &amp; combines it all into nothing short of a masterpiece.    


 How to Defeat Scratch in Alan Wake 2 
          

The only way to defeat Scratch in Alan Wake 2 is to shine two large lights onto a cell next to the lake in Bright Falls, then lure the creature into the structure. While this may seem simple at first, Scratch is relentless, pursuing Saga while you try to carefully move the lights into position. Each takes a considerable amount of time to move, leaving you exposed to Scratch&#39;s attacks while the being controls Alan.






Alan Wake, taken over by Scratch, wields a large pipe wrench that deals heavy damage when swung at you. Be careful and try to avoid this attack, as any hit can stagger you while it only takes a few strikes to defeat Saga completely.




Thankfully, Saga is not without her backup in the form of her partner Alex Casey, who uses a huge spotlight to stun Scratch if you shoot the entity enough times. You can find more ammo to use for this by opening the crates next to either light. Once the Dark Presence within Wake is staggered for a short period of time, take the opportunity to slowly adjust the lights toward the cell in Alan Wake 2.

Once you have two lights in the right spots, lure Scratch into the open cell by walking into it, which should trigger a cutscene that leads into the final segments of the game. While you may not beat Scratch at this point in Alan Wake 2, you do learn more about how the entity works to stop their plans in a different way as you reach the story&#39;s conclusion.
