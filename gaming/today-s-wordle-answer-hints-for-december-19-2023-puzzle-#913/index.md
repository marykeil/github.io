## Literature Review

Solving today&#39;s Wordle shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for most fans of the game but if help is needed, we&#39;ve got the daily hints and fully spoiled answer.





For those that do enjoy more of a challenge, Wordle does provide a Hard Mode which can be turned on before any game. This will lock in correct letters and clues by forcing you to use them in future guesses. Doing this will remove the ability to do starting Wordle word combos that may provide a lot of letters in only two guesses.

The December 19th Wordle answer is TABLE.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which provided quite a few clues. Two misplaced letters, &#39;A&#39; and &#39;T&#39;, and a correctly placed &#39;E&#39; is a fantastic way to start. Moving forward we tried MATHE as our second guess which locked in the &#39;A&#39; and basically provided the only possible placement for &#39;T&#39;.

This was easy to figure out with the provided clues and we easily scored a Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, TABLE. Another puzzle down and less than 20 more available for 2023.
