# One Thing Prevents A Truly Evil Playthrough In Baldur s Gate 3


## SUMMARY 



  The evil path in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is limited due to the trajectory of the story, making it impossible to fully commit to the dark path.   Joining forces with Ketheric Thorm, the leader of the Absolute&#39;s army, is not possible, as the encounter ultimately goes haywire and leads to a boss fight.   While there are other options to serve the goals of the enemy, no major outcome in the game revolves around serving the Absolute.

## Literature Review

There&#39;s no need to be the good guy in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but taking the opposite direction does tend to run into one particular limitation.




Taking an evil approach is an interesting way to play through a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaign, but one major limitation makes it impossible to fully commit to the dark path. Like in tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons, helping NPCs out and having a positive effect on the world isn&#39;t necessary to progress the story, and it&#39;s not that hard to leave a trail of destruction in the wake of the party. While theft, murder, betrayal and more are frequently easy to employ, some higher-level schemes aren&#39;t always possible thanks to the trajectory of the story.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]

The main thrust of the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 plot deals with the threat of the Absolute, a mysterious entity that&#39;s taken up the role of a dark god in the world of Faerûn. This threat is especially immediate for the core party members of the game, who are all infected with mind flayer parasites that seem to give them a special link to thralls of the Absolute. The obvious thing to do is figure out how to get rid of these parasites and save the world from the clutches of the Absolute, but the power-hungry might see an opportunity in embracing this shift and throwing their lot in with the Absolute.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 


 It&#39;s Impossible To Side With Ketheric Thorm In BG3 
         




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 seems to offer a path to joining the Absolute&#39;s side near the end of Act 2. General Ketheric Thorm, the leader of the armies of the Absolute, seeks to retrieve the Nightsong from the Shadowfell, which is described to the party as a relic that he requires. Helping his disciple Balthazar take the Nightsong should be an easy way into Ketheric&#39;s good graces, and, by extension, would theoretically provide an opportunity to ally with him and the Absolute to push the story in a much darker direction.

Unfortunately for evildoers, there&#39;s not actually any way to turn this encounter into an alliance with Ketheric. Thanks to the d20-like artifact that Shadowheart introduces to the party early in the game, even a welcome reception by Ketheric after retrieving the Nightsong will ultimately go haywire. The only way to make it out of Act 2 is to beat Ketheric in a boss fight, and the Nightsong, who turns out to be an aasimar daughter of the goddess Selûne rather than an inanimate object, is willing to fight alongside the party to ensure Ketheric&#39;s demise.






Another evil path in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is to kill the Nightsong, although this severs any hope of getting into Ketheric Thorm&#39;s good graces immediately.




This can be especially disappointing thanks to Ketheric Thorm&#39;s major stage presence, as he tends to be a gripping personality from the moment he debuts in Act 2 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. It&#39;s easy to save a lot of compelling recurring characters in good-aligned campaigns that get killed throughout the narrative if evil choices are made, so it would be nice to spend some more time with an iconic villain as a consolation prize. Considering the power-seeking nature of most evil parties and the need for a major climax, it&#39;s doubtful that such an alliance would last forever, but it could certainly go on for longer than its brief appearance.

                  One Hidden Secret Reveals Ketheric Thorm&#39;s Evil Plan In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Act 2 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 contains some shocking revelations, but its possible to find them out early thanks to a little investigation (and luck).   






 Joining Ketheric Would Cause Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Problems 
          

Having the opportunity to side with major villains is a common feature of DnD campaigns, and it can be disappointing to realize that overtures of friendship from one of the most memorable foes in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 won&#39;t ultimately amount to anything. From a game design perspective, however, it&#39;s easy to see why developer Larian Studios chose not to pursue this route. Entering Act 3 from a radically different angle would rewrite the majority of the act, and considering how complex it already is, this would be a huge drain on resources and time during the game&#39;s development.

                  The Funniest Content In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Is Hidden In An Act 3 Side Area   Some of the best Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 content is off the beaten path, and taking some diversions can lead to memorable gags and exciting encounters.   




Ketheric Thorm isn&#39;t the only major figure serving the side of the Absolute, however, as he&#39;s only one among three Chosen of the death gods to take part in the scheme. The others, Lord Enver Gortash and Orin the Red, both present offers to work together in Act 3. These options still provide interesting ways to serve the goals of the enemy without overthrowing the entire structure of the story, so choosing to side with Gortash or Orin is an appreciable evil option in the wake of the disappointing outcome with Ketheric.



 Serving The Absolute Isn&#39;t A Real Option In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

No matter what agreements are made with the Chosen, however, no major outcome of the game builds on the idea of serving the Absolute as the end goal. From a narrative perspective, this ultimately has to do with the nature of the enemy. Bowing to the Absolute would mean becoming a mindless thrall, whether literally or just in spirit, so there isn&#39;t much of a way for it to play out in a manner that would feel rewarding at the end of a long journey.




It is possible to end up as a thrall of the Absolute, but it&#39;s presented more in the manner of a Game Over than an ending proper, so most players will want to reload and continue after being subjected to such a fate. There&#39;s also a major evil ending to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that does involve embracing the power of the Absolute, just not in the service of the elder brain that&#39;s taken on that role or the Chosen that manipulate the power over it. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 doesn&#39;t stop parties short of embracing power, it simply limits the methods of getting there in a way that overlooks a few key opportunities.

                  Does Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Really Have 17,000 Endings?   It’s been said that Baldur’s Gate 3 has 17,000 different endings, but how true is that claim? An interview sheds some light on BG3’s many conclusions.   

It&#39;s hard not to feel like fighting Ketheric Thorm is a diversion from any evil path in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as there&#39;s no way around the fact that the party is saying farewell to Act 2 with a heroic act. Although it may be easy enough to turn back to misdeeds in Act 3, it&#39;s still the most notable hiccup in a villainous campaign. Ketheric Thorm could have been the perfect villainous ally in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it&#39;s just not possible to stand by his side for very long.
