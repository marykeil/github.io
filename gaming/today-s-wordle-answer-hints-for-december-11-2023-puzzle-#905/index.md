 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
December 11th #905
          

The December 11th Wordle answer is HOUSE.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE, this provided only a single &#39;E&#39; in the correct location, and a chunk of incorrect letters. Moving forward we tried SPOKE which added two misplaced letters with &#39;S&#39; and &#39;O&#39;.

Feeling a little more confident with all those clues we tried CHOSE as our third guess which was clearly a mistake since we didn&#39;t move the &#39;O&#39; from the last guess, but it did lock in &#39;S&#39; and added the misplaced &#39;H&#39;. This was an easy jump now to our Wordle win-in-four with HOUSE.
