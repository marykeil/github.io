## Literature Review

The release date for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC has finally been announced, and it is hard to imagine a more perfect time.




The release date for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC has been officially confirmed, and it is perfectly placed in the calendar. The confirmation of any new Pokémon release will inevitably bring a fresh wave of excitement, and the release of The Indigo Disk is no different. The second half of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC has plenty in store for people to enjoy, and looks like it may be shaping up to be even better than The Teal Mask.




The Indigo Disk will build heavily upon all that has come before it, including both the base Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games as well as the previous Teal Mask DLC. The ending of The Teal Mask, combined with lingering mysteries from the base games, means that there is plenty for The Indigo Disk to explore even before considering its own all-new features. As a result, the DLC has been eagerly anticipated, a sentiment that this latest announcement will only fuel to greater heights.

                  Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC - Release Date, New Pokémon, Price, &amp; Story   New information about Scarlet and Violet’s second DLC, The Indigo Disk, has been revealed, including new Pokémon, story details, and more.    


 The Indigo Disk’s December 14 Release Date Is Perfect Timing 
          

The Indigo Disk will be releasing on December 14, 2023. This means that it is perfectly timed for the holiday season, which brings a wide range of benefits for Scarlet and Violet as a whole. For example, Pokémon games make excellent presents, and so The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, either in conjunction with the base games or by itself, is likewise a prime choice for any Pokémon fan. The DLC as a whole will easily provide many hours of additional content, a considerable benefit regardless of whether the base games have already been played.




A Winter release date also means that for many people, especially younger fans, there will be plenty of free time to complete the DLC in. The holiday season typically means a break from education and work, allowing for more entertaining diversions to be pursued instead. Naturally, a new Pokémon release is a perfect fit for this, particularly with the series’ emphasis on community; with plenty of people playing around the world at the same time, there is every chance of new friendships being forged through exciting battles and trades. The December release date positions the DLC to take full advantage of this, for the benefit of all.

A DLC package is also well-suited to the holiday season due to its playtime. Depending on what objectives people set for themselves, it does not take a particularly long time to complete The Teal Mask, although side content away from the main storyline can provide a good few hours of entertainment alone. The Indigo Disk is likely to be the same in this regard, being much shorter than the main games by itself. As a result, it will be easy to fit playing the DLC around any other holiday plans that people may have, quickly receiving the full experience no matter what else people may have to do.






 Pokémon Games Typically Release In Time For The Holidays 
          

Of course, many previous releases in the Pokémon franchise have followed a similar schedule to The Indigo Disk, albeit not so closely targeted. For example, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet themselves were originally released on November 18, 2022, making them slightly early for the holiday season but not incredibly so. Instead, although this date was essentially a month ahead of the holidays, the timing was still close enough to have an effect on sales. The initial release date made it natural for many copies of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to become Christmas presents and the like, which seems to have become a tried and true strategy for Pokémon over the years.


 




Prior to Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Sword and Shield also launched in November, as did Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. The only Pokémon game of Generation 8 to not release in November was Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which instead arrived on shelves on January 28, 2022. Similarly, all Gen 7 games were released in a November, although Gen 6’s Pokémon X and Y instead dropped in October 2013 instead. Overall, the Pokémon franchise has established a pattern of November release dates, just close enough to December for many to justify waiting for the holidays to arrive before receiving a copy.



The two parts of Pokémon Sword and Shield’s DLC were originally released in June and October 2020 respectively, but a physical bundle edition was again on sale from November of that year.




From that perspective, The Indigo Disk’s release date is actually better timed than that of many prior entries in the franchise. By being timed so close to Christmas, it emphasizes the potential of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero to be a holiday gift, whether in full or simply the second half. Moreover, it also seems certain that sales of the DLC and perhaps even the base games will see a dramatic spike this Winter.






 The Indigo Disk’s Release Is Better Timed Than Most Core Pokémon Games 
         

It is also worth noting that there is a relatively short period of time between the release date announcement and the actual release date - just over a month. This means that the excitement generated by this news may not abate much before The Indigo Disk itself actually arrives, further ensuring a high, active interest is maintained in the release. It is a clever piece of marketing strategy, and will doubtlessly make the wait until the holidays even more notable this year.

The announcement of any Pokémon release date is always cause for excitement, even more so when it is for something so eagerly anticipated as this DLC. The Indigo Disk will have new Pokémon, characters, and more, all of which will make it a compelling purchase. There is no question that a December release date means it will also feature on many gift lists, and while this may place a small gap between the actual release and many people’s playing of it, it is all but negligible in the grand scheme of things. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s newest content is perfectly poised to delight when it arrives this holiday season.
