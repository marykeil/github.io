## Literature Review

During Version 4.2, you will be able to obtain a free copy of Freminet in Genshin Impact. Here’s how to unlock the free 4-star Cryo character.





If you already have Freminet, you will unlock a free Constellation for the character, further enhancing his combat abilities. With Freminet’s best build in Genshin Impact, the playable hero can be molded into something that matches the potential of certain 5-star characters. Of course, you will first have to unlock Freminet for free. Luckily the steps leading up to the acquisition of the hero are quite simple.




                  Genshin Impact - Freminet Character Ascension (&amp; Materials)   Fully Ascending and leveling Freminet is an important step in transforming him into a power DPS in Genshin Impact. Here’s all you’ll need.    


 How To Unlock Freminet For Free In Genshin Impact 
          

To obtain Freminet for free during Version 4.2, you will need to participate in the event named Thelxie’s Fantastic Adventures. This event is set in the region of Fontaine and is commissioned by the Fontaine Fishing Association. Despite the institution that is requesting aid, you will not be fishing. This event in Genshin Impact 4.2 will see you assisting Freminet in repairing and enhancing his clockwork penguin friend, Thelxie. There are three game modes associated with the event. The first mode, Motherboard Troubleshooting, sees you fidgeting with Thelxie’s motherboard circuitry. The objective is to establish connections.




The second mode in the flagship event is Record of the Search for Glory. In this game mode, you will need to search for specific items that are hidden underwater. The third and final mode in Thelxie’s Fantastic Adventure is called Purgation Counterstrike. This is a combat mode that counts with Thelxie itself as a modifier capable of assisting when defeating enemies. According to the livestream held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch, you will need to “meet the Invitation Criteria” to get Freminet for free, though the specifications of the criteria itself have not yet been explained.



This should be a fairly simple event in terms of structure, but an ongoing one that should last a few days.






 What Freminet Does In Genshin Impact 
          




Freminet is a Cryo character that uses a claymore in battle. Lyney and Lynette’s younger sibling is a main DPS character focused on dealing Physical Damage, somewhat like a 4-star version of Eula. Being able to vary from Physical Damage to Cryo Damage, Freminet is also quite capable of assisting his team to trigger Elemental Reactions in Genshin Impact.

In addition to his prowess in battle, having Freminet in your party – even if he isn&#39;t set as the current active character – reduces the entire team’s consumption of Aquatic Stamina, essentially allowing them to swim faster for longer. Although he is far from being a fantastic DPS character, the Cryo character can be a valuable asset in a team comp. On top of that, the underwater buff alone is enough to justify the effort of grinding the event in order to obtain Freminet for free during Genshin Impact 4.2.
