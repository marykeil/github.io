# Everything To Expect From Ark Survival Ascended s New Map


## SUMMARY 



  The remastered version of the map in Ark: Survival Ascended won&#39;t be too different from the original version featured in Survival Evolved, although adjustments could be made.   The new map includes various biomes, lava caverns, giant waterfalls, and a floating island, providing a diverse and challenging environment for survivors.   The hazardous biomes in The Center, along with the numerous creatures and removal of movement speed as a stat, make it more dangerous for survivors, requiring them to be cautious and adapt their strategies.

## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended is receiving another map in February that players experienced in Survival Evolved. Hereâ€™s what we know about the newest map.




Ark: Survival Ascended is getting a new map, but it might seem familiar to survivors who&#39;ve played ARK: Survival Evolved in the past. Because of the connection between these games, it&#39;s safe to assume that the remastered version of this map added to Survival Ascended won&#39;t be too different from the original version that was featured in Survival Evolved. However, it&#39;s possible that adjustments could be made to the new variation of this map, which has been seen with other features in Survival Ascended already.




The Center was originally a free DLC map added to Survival Evolved in 2016, and now it&#39;s coming to Survival Ascended. With its release date set for February, survivors won&#39;t have to wait long before heading to battle in a new environment. Looking back at The Center as it was in Survival Evolved should be enough to provide survivors with an idea of what to expect in the new version, but it&#39;s possible that details will be changed or that features could be removed or added.


 The Center In ARK: Survival Evolved 
Features Of The Original Map
         

To start with, The Center included all the biomes found on The Island ARK map, but it also had a Lava Biome added to it. Other features were lava caverns, giant waterfalls, ocean systems, ice caverns, Ancient Ruins, cave systems, and a floating island. Overall, these features came together to create a map with extremely high- and low-elevation areas. Low-elevation areas included air bubbles that allowed for building beneath the ocean and an underground area with its own ecosystem and sun where entire cities could be built. On the other hand, high-elevation areas come with the risk of falling great distances.




                  10 Hidden Features In Ark: Survival Ascended That Will Improve Your Experience   There are so many mechanics in Ark: Survival Ascended, it&#39;s natural that some players won&#39;t know all of these useful hidden features and tips.    

The original The Center map had a difficulty of 5, which means that the dinosaurs in the wild could be up to Level 150. That also meant that the loot survivors would get on the map was better quality compared to maps with a lower difficulty. Since this map also had end-game boss battles that were made to be challenging, survivors could get even more rewards from taking down those foes. Overall, there was a lot happening on The Center map between the incredibly vertical set-up, extreme biomes that range from lava to ice, and boss encounters.



 Environment Of The Center In ARK: Survival Evolved 
Hazards Survivors Can Encounter
          




The Center&#39;s biomes were full of dangers that survivors needed to navigate. The lava biome had rivers of lava and lava lakes, which could make building a base difficult or require some extra creativity while designing. Other maps would get darker to an extent when going lower into the ocean, but The Center took that feature further and increased the amount of darkness as a survivor went deeper into the depths. Plus, the variety of caves and caverns across different biome types in The Center meant that survivors needed to brave a variety of hazards while searching for Artifacts.

The Center, when added to ARK: Survival Evolved, had 107 creatures that survivors could come across while exploring the map. The number and variety of enemies that could pop up combined with the environmental dangers created a lot of fear among survivors and made it difficult to run away. With Survival Ascended removing movement speed as a stat that survivors could stack and use to outrun any enemy they encounter, The Center could end up being even more dangerous, since survivors will need to either face the creatures, or find ways to evade them.






 How Ascended Could Force The Center To Change 
The Impact Of Previous Adjustments
          

Some of the differences between Survival Evolved and Survival Ascended force adjustments to be made to the way that survivors play on The Center, even if nothing about the map itself is changed when it&#39;s implemented in Survival Ascended. Movement speed removal as a stat brings a lot of changes to how every map is played. Now, The Center is a map with many environmental changes and a rather vertical layout. Survivors will need to be more aware of their surroundings to avoid dying from either dinosaurs or the environment.

The added difficulty with how Cryopods and Cryofridges in Survival Ascended work could also impact the strategies that survivors would normally use in The Center when setting up to fight dinosaurs or other survivors. The Gigantoraptor has won the vote and will be added alongside The Center, which could help survivors since this creature will nurture the young of a tribe, teaching them to fight. But the hard part of taming Gigantoraptors is that survivors can&#39;t tame grown ones, and they instead have to enter a nest and tame a young Gigantoraptor that can then be taken back to the tribe.






 Additional Information About The Original Map 
Details That Could Be In The New Version
          

The Center had a lot of creatures, but it didn&#39;t add any new creatures to Survival Evolved. However, the Gigantoraptor is changing that with Survival Ascended by being added early due to the results of a community vote. In terms of gameplay, survivors playing on PvP servers will want to be extra careful with where they set up their tribe if Survival Ascended keeps the triple damage dealt to structures in caves, the underground area, underwater, and the Ancient Ruins. Although it&#39;s possible that the damage increase to structures that are below surface level might not be included in this variation.

There&#39;s plenty to be excited about with The Center being added to Survival Ascended based on the information available for the original version of the map that was included in Survival Evolved. However, aside from the Gigantoraptor, there&#39;s no official information about how or if the developers will change The Center for this updated version, meaning that most of the speculation about it is simply based on the features of the old map. Luckily, survivors don&#39;t need to wait too long before they hop into The Center and experience any changes - or merely nostalgia - firsthand, since it&#39;s coming in February to ARK: Survival Ascended.
