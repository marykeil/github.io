## Literature Review

Knotroot is an essential mid-game crafting resource that can be found in caves in LEGO Fortnite. However, to harvest it, players need upgraded tools.





You won’t need Knotroot straight away, but once you’ve set up your village and recruited a few LEGO Fortnite Villagers, it quickly becomes essential. Unfortunately, it isn’t immediately obvious where you can find some, and you will also need the Uncommon quality Forest Axe to harvest it. This takes some crafting work, so you will need to collect other basic resources.

 How To Find Knotroot In LEGO Fortnite 
          

Knotroot grows on the walls and ceilings of caves in LEGO Fortnite. Unfortunately, because every LEGO Fortnite world is different, you will have to take charge and explore your own world to find caves. However, there are usually a few within walking distance of your starting area, and if you’ve spent time preparing to craft some Marble Slabs in LEGO Fortnite, then you probably have some idea where your nearest cave is.

Inside most caves, you should be able to spot Knotroot. It’s a gnarled, twisted root that grows all around you. However, to harvest it, you need the Uncommon quality Forest Axe.




          

To get the Axe, you first need to upgrade your Crafting Bench, which requires Wooden Planks and Shells. Wooden Planks can be made by processing Wood through a Lumber Mill, which is fairly easy to obtain. On the other hand, Shells only drop when you kill Rollers: tough monsters with rocky shells that will charge and try to knock you down or spit rocks at you.

          

Once you’ve upgraded your Crafting Bench, you can craft the Uncommon quality Forest Axe with 3 Bones and 3 Wooden Rods. Bones drop when you defeat Skeletons, so you may have already picked some up during the night when Skeletons try to attack your Village. Wooden Rods are made by processing Wood in the Lumber Mill, making them easy to obtain.




          

With the Axe, you can chop and harvest Knotroot. It’s worth noting that Knotroot doesn’t regenerate over time, so you will eventually need to search for other caves.



 How To Use Knotroot In LEGO Fortnite 
          

Knotroot is used in many crafting recipes and upgrades, including for the Crafting Bench. As such, if you aim to craft higher-quality gear, you must collect Knotroot and other rare resources, such as LEGO Fortnite’s Sand Claws, for Crafting Bench upgrades. Besides gear and Crafting Bench upgrades, Knotroot is also used to craft weapons such as the Longsword, and it’s essential for upgrading your LEGO Fortnite Village.




For all intents and purposes, Knotroot effectively replaces basic Wood in the mid-game. All LEGO Fortnite Villages need large quantities of Knotroot, so it’s best to map out caves and have a sturdy axe ready while exploring your world.
