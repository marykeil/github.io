## Literature Review

Gems are the primary currency of Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, and can be farmed by completing specific missions and challenges within the game.





One of the obvious ways to gain a lot of Gems fast is to buy the Gem Packs and Value Cards offered by the in-game shop of DMC: Peak of Combat. Value Cards automatically give you 100 Gems per day for 30 days, giving you a constant supply for a limited time. This method can give you a steady foundation of Gems to spend, but it can be taxing to spend consistent real-world money.




                  Devil May Cry: The 10 Best Games In The Series, According To Metacritic   With Devil May Cry 6 still likely a long way off, these are the best games of the iconic hack-and-slash series so far.   


 How To Get Gems Fast in Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat 
         

The fastest way to gain Gems in DMC: Peak of Combat is to complete the Bloody Palace, pursue one-time rewards, participate in events, and buy them from the Co-Op shop. The Bloody Palace is an arena where you fight wave after wave of enemy groups to progress to harder stages. This place is the easiest location to farm Gems since your Bloody Palace run ends only if you lose or choose to stop.



Challenges within the Bloody Palace reset twice a week, and you will be rewarded with 200 Gems if you manage to beat each goal presented in this specific game mode.







Normal missions can give you another type of item called Chaos Coppers, which can be exchanged at the Co-Op shop for Gems. Turning in 1000 Chaos Coppers will net you around 100 Gems, but this method may only be done once weekly as the store resets. The best chance to farm Gems actually begins when you start DMC: Peak of Combat for the first time.

Beginners can beat Training Stages, reach Office Levels, and clear stages in the Realm Conqueror mode to earn Gems as first-time rewards. Reaching new Collector Ranks and earning Achievement Rewards will also give you Gems during your initial progression. Make sure to conserve your Gems until you have met many of these starting goals in DMC: Peak of Combat.

Unlike Devil May Cry 5&#39;s Special Edition, DMC: Peak of Combat has events planned to cycle throughout the game&#39;s lifespan as of this time of writing. Currently, the Launch Celebration event rewards players with Gems if they participate. Other limited-time offers like testing out banner-exclusive characters or binding your game accounts are other small ways to earn at least 100&#43; Gems.




Any time you farm Gems in Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, you can expand your experience and unlock new features or characters that keep things feeling stylish.
