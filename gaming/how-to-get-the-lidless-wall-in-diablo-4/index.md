## Literature Review

The Lidless Wall is a Legendary Unique shield for the Necromancer class that makes it easy to clear waves of enemies in Diablo 4&#39;s toughest dungeons.





While the Lidless Wall is a dream item for Necromancers in Diablo 4, obtaining it may be a nightmare. Not only is it not a guaranteed drop, it&#39;s an extremely rare one. To make matters worse, you specifically have to grind for it in World Tier 3: Nightmare or World Tier 4: Torment. Fortunately, a few strategies can increase your chances of acquiring the Lidless Wall.




                  Diablo 4 Season 3 Is Bringing Back One Of Diablo 3’s Best Features   Diablo 4’s next season will include even more fun additions to the game, including a play mechanic feature that was very successful in Diablo 3.   


 How To Farm The Lidless Wall 
          

Although it is not guaranteed, there is a chance the Lidless Wall will drop from the Lord Zir boss fight. You can find this boss at the Ancient&#39;s Seat dungeon in World Tier 4, and of course, you will have to summon him to begin the fight.

To spawn Lord Zir, you need to place nine Exquisite Blood at the Bloodied Altar in the Ancient&#39;s Seat dungeon. You get Exquisite Blood by defeating World Bosses and completing Activities in World Tier 4. It&#39;s no secret that this method is tedious, but Lord Zir is the only endgame boss who drops the Lidless Wall. So it&#39;s worth a shot, or ten because the Lidless Wall makes for one of the most OP builds in Diablo 4.






 How To Get The Lidless Wall As A Drop 
          

The only other way to get the Lidless Wall is as a drop from level 85&#43; enemies in World Tier 3 or 4. Even though it&#39;s a minor difference, the Lidless Wall has a better chance of dropping in World Tier 4: Torment. So, it&#39;s best to grind this difficulty if you&#39;re high enough.



You can not get the Lidless Wall as a drop in World Tier 1 or 2.




Regardless, the best chance you have to get the Lidless Wall to drop is from Nightmare Dungeons or Helltide Events. Both of these have elite mobs, which have a higher drop rate. Aside from that, participating in Legion Events, unlocking Reward Chests and Caches, and completing Whispers of the Dead requests will increase your chances of getting the Lidless Wall to drop in Diablo 4.
