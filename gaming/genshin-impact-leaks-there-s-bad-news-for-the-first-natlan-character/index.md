# Genshin Impact Leaks There s Bad News For The First Natlan Character


## SUMMARY 



  The first character from Natlan in Genshin Impact may only be a 4-star hero, disappointing players who expected a 5-star character.   However, Iansan&#39;s rumored ranking is not surprising as previous region releases have featured a mix of 4-star and 5-star characters.   Even with Iansan&#39;s leaked ranking, there may be good news for players who want to integrate her into team comps in Genshin Impact.

## Literature Review

According to leaks, there may be bad news for players looking forward to playing with Iansan, the first character from Genshin Impact’s Natlan region.




A new Genshin Impact leak about Natlan indicates there is bad news for one of the first characters in the upcoming region. Even though the next region of Teyvat is likely still some Versions and months away from being officially added to the game, some leaks regarding the next major 5.0 update and its map extensions are starting to be shared. Natlan, known as the Nation of War and home to the Pyro Archon in Teyvat, is already confirmed as the next destination for the Traveler and Paimon as they adventure in search of the Traveler’s lost sibling.




A few details about the region were revealed during the main Archon Quests in Fontaine. Natlan is known to be a land of dragons, much like Vishaps, but these creatures have evolved and some have even found a way to integrate human society to some degree. It has also been shared by Neuvillette that the Fatui Harbinger known as Capitano has made his way into Natlan and is participating in the several wars that take place there. Natlan’s release in Genshin Impact is still months away, expected to occur in August, but there are some leaks about the upcoming content.

                  Genshin Impact Leaks: Weapons Update May Significantly Change The Game   A new leak suggests that an update will offer players better options when trying to acquire 5-star weapons for their characters in Genshin Impact.   


 First Natlan Character In Genshin Impact May Be 4-Star 
          




According to leaked information obtained by the leaker known as White, which was later shared by a user on Reddit, the first character from Natlan that was ever shown off will be a 4-star hero. The small girl with dark skin, who was first showcased in 2020’s Travail trailer on Genshin Impact’s YouTube channel, is reported to have a 4-star ranking rather than a 5-star one. This may be upsetting news for players who anticipated the character, called Iansan, to be a 5-star character. As a possible 4-star hero, there is a chance that her powers will be less remarkable.



Currently, Iansan is the only playable character from Natlan to have had her design officially shown off by HoYoverse. Other Natlan characters have only been mentioned by name so far.






 Iansan’s Leaked 4-Star Rank In Genshin Impact Natlan Leaks Isn’t Surprising 
          




Even though the leaks about Iansan’s 4-star ranking may be upsetting to a few players, it should not come across as a big surprise. In the Travail trailer, HoYoverse highlighted a few characters from each region as a means to show their roadmap for the live service during the 10 years following its original release. While Mondstadt highlighted the 5-star Pyro unit Diluc as its hero of choice, Liyue had the 4-star Geo unit Ningguang chosen as its representative. Later on, Inazuma has Ayaka Kamisato, while Sumeru showcases Cyno – both of which are powerful 5-star characters in Genshin Impact.


 

HoYoverse then put Fontaine in the spotlight. The representatives for the Nation of Justice are the siblings Lyney and Lynette. Lyney is a 5-star Pyro unit, while Lynette is a 4-star Anemo character. As such, it seems like the Travail trailer is holding no specific behavior on the rankings of upcoming characters in the game, as it has shown a healthy mix of 4-star and 5-star characters up until now. The leak about Natlan’s Iansan being a 4-star unit should not be a problem. Moreover, it does not eliminate the possibility of a 5-star Natlan character in Genshin Impact 5.0.




                  New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.   



 Genshin Impact 5.0 Will Still Likely Have A 5-Star Natlan Character 
         

Even though the leak posted on Reddit states that there is a chance that Iansan, the first character from Natlan, will be a 4-star unit, there is still hope for a 5-star character when the region of Pyro is finally released. So far, all major Nation releases have had at least one new regional 5-star hero featured in a character banner. In Version 2.0, for instance, Inazuma’s release was pushed forward with two limited-time character banners. Ayaka and Yoimiya were the first 5-star heroes from Inazuma, and their release was accompanied by the 4-star unit Sayu’s debut in Genshin Impact.




In 2022’s Version 3.0, the release of Sumeru was met by two characters, one of which was a 5-star unit, while the other was a 4-star hero. The 5-star character released with the region of Dendro was Tighnari, while the 4-star unit was Collei. More recently, Fontaine arrived and, with its Version 4.0 update, three characters from the Nation of Justice were released, one of which is a 5-star. In Phase 1 banners, HoYoverse introduced Lyney and his sister Lynette in Genshin Impact. In the Phase 2 banners, their younger brother, Freminet, made his debut as a playable character.

As such, it is likely that even if Iansan from Natlan debuts as a 4-star hero, as suggested by the leaks so far, there will still be a 5-star unit accompanying the release of Natlan in Version 5.0. At this point, there is no leaked information or rumors about which character will be introduced along with the region of Pyro, however. If Iansan does debut as early as Version 5.0, however, there may be some very exciting news for players on the horizon, based on previous region releases in Genshin Impact.






 Iansan May Be Given Out For Free In Genshin Impact 5.0 
          

Currently, there is no telling if Iansan will even be released along with Version 5.0, despite being the first character from Natlan ever shown. Cyno was the first hero from Sumeru, showcased in the Travail trailer, but only arrived as a playable character in Version 3.1, weeks after the release of the region of Dendro. Regardless, HoYoverse has upheld a tradition since the release of Sumeru, over two years ago: free characters.



With the release of every x.0 update, the developer has given out a new 4-star character in Genshin Impact for free, in an attempt to promote the content.




With Version 3.0, the character given out for free was Collei, who made her debut in that same update. Other than promoting the release of the patch itself, this was also a way of offering players the chance to try out Dendro as a playable element, other than the Dendro Traveler themselves. This was continued in 2023, with the release of Fontaine. The 4-star debut, Lynette, was given out for free during Version 4.0. This allowed players to try out the Arkhe system in Genshin Impact – Lynette is aligned with Ousia, while the Hydro Traveler is aligned with Pneuma.




                  Genshin Impact 4.5 Leaks Reveal New Banner Characters   Even though Version 4.5 is still a ways away from arriving, there are already leaks regarding the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact.   

Natlan’s release may include a new gameplay mechanic that is exclusive to the area and, if it does, HoYoverse will likely offer a free 4-star character to allow players to fully experience it. So far, the free characters have also been the first 4-star debuts so, if Iansan is truly a 4-star character, as was mentioned in the leak, and she does get released in Version 5.0, players may be looking at a free copy of Iansan once Natlan arrives to Genshin Impact’s ever-expanding world of Teyvat.
