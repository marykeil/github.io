## Literature Review

The fun of Goat Simulator 3 is best played with friends in multiplayer, where you can run wild as a screaming farm animal and cause chaos once again.





There is currently no crossplay between systems as of this time of writing, and online multiplayer cannot host people playing in local split-screen mode. Anyone joining together must make the decision to either play online or offline, but not both. Thankfully, it&#39;s fairly easy to pursue quests in Goat Simulator 3 as a group once you coordinate the platform and method you should host for your friends.




                  Goat Simulator 3 Should Be Your Next Big Party Game   Goat Simulator 3 will feature a 4-player multiplayer mode which is awesome because wreaking havoc on the world as a goat is better with friends.    


 How to Host Multiplayer Games in Goat Simulator 3 
          

When your profile is online in a game of Goat Simulator 3, you can click the &#34;Invite&#34; button from the Friends option in the main menu to add others to your server without any issues. You have to be friends with the players you wish to invite, or their names will not appear in the Friends menu. Up to four players can be rambunctious goats together in Goat Simulator 3 at the same time.



A maximum of four players is a limitation for both online multiplayer games and local split-screen adventures with your friends locally.







This method only works online, and those playing locally will have to have multiple controllers set up first. Potential split-screen players can hold the Square button on PlayStation or the X button on Xbox to add themselves to the game. There will be an option to sign in from the console&#39;s available accounts, but you do not have to do this to create a multiplayer experience in Goat Simulator 3.

After your friends gather in multiplayer, you have seven mini-games to compete in anywhere on the map if you unlock them. The many Easter Eggs in Goat Simulator 3 are also available for your team to discover as you spread untold chaos through your actions. Feel free to headbutt, lick, trample, and jump across the map once your friends are in the same game.

Any achievements or trophies earned while you play with your friends in Goat Simulator 3 will carry over into everybody&#39;s solo games and do not have to be pursued again.
