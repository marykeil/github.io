## Literature Review

Solving the puzzles in the Cave of Wonders in Disney Dreamlight Valley will get you one step closer to finding answers about Eternity Isle.





The Cave of Wonders puzzles are the last quests you will need to do to unlock Gaston in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Before this point, players will have collected Agave Dates and caught Scorpions to keep Gaston from getting too hungry. Following this quest line will eventually lead players right to the door of the Cave of Wonders, and Gaston is happy to let you go inside alone on this one.






To begin the &#34;Diamond in the Rough&#34; Quest, you must have both halves of the Scarab beetle in your inventory. Gaston will put them together into a flying golden beetle, and it may be hard to follow at first. Interact with it once it comes to a rest to open the Cave of Wonders.




                  How To Unlock Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley   Eternity Isle is the new, separate, area introduced through Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Rift In Time expansion, but players will need help to reach it.   


 How To Get Past The First Door In The Cave Of Wonders 
         

Walking into the Cave of Wonders, you will meet Jafar, who will give you some tips on how to solve the puzzles inside. Head over to the left, clear all the Splinters of Fate, and keep going until you find a Power Coil. There will be more Splinters of Fate, so ensure you have cooked some restorative recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Hook it up to the empty slot on the wall in front of you, and then head back to where you first entered the Cave.




When you return to the front, you can see a beam of light touching the left side of the door but not the right. Look to your right, and there will be a switch that you can pull. Interact with it, and it will bring down a mirror to reflect the second beam of light, opening the door for you to continue with the puzzle.



 How To Solve The Power Coil Puzzle In The Cave Of Wonders 
          

Head through to the next main room and then keep heading right. You will come to what looks like a circuit board, and interacting with the Power Coil in the middle will inform you that it is not charged. This puzzle wants you to complete the circuit so all the lines glow blue and lead from the charging station to the Power Coil in the middle.



Turning all the lines blue can be done in multiple ways; if you want to do it in as few turns as possible, consult the chart below. The buttons are labeled as if the player faces the Power Coil from the room&#39;s entrance, with &#34;Bottom&#34; meaning closest to the entrance and &#34;Top&#34; meaning furthest away.







  Button   Number of Turns    Bottom Left   1    Top Left   2    Top Center   1    Top Right   3    Bottom Right   2   



Once they are all lit up, you can pick the Power Coil up and take it back to the main room. You can put the Power Coil into the empty slot or keep it in your pocket for now unless you have stuffed your inventory in Disney Dreamlight Valley a little too full with the new items in this expansion. Either way, head into the left opening from the main room and clear out more Splinters of Fate.



 How To Solve The Mirror Puzzle In The Cave Of Wonders 
          




After clearing the Splinters, you will have made a path to a mirror lying on the ground and a second switch. There is another switch on the wall that doesn’t need anything cleared to reach it. Interact with both switches and pick up the mirror before returning to the main room. Before you reach it, the light beam will end on the wall to your left in a spot that looks like a mirror.

Put the mirror on the wall by interacting with it and continue back to the main room. If you didn’t before, put the Power Coil in the empty slot now and flick the switch in the main room. This will allow you to enter the next door. The path is long, but there are no more puzzles between you and the Jewel of Time.

Head back to Gaston to announce your success, and you will have a short conversation. By the time that conversation ends, you will have earned yourself back the Coconut LeFou, and Gaston will have announced that he’s here to stay. That will be the end of the Diamond in the Rough Quest after puzzling your way through the Cave of Wonders in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and you can continue your journey to find the other cool new additions from the Rift In Time Expansion.
