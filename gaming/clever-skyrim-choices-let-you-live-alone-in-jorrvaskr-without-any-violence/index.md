## Literature Review

There&#39;s a ton one can do in Skyrim, but one very smart set of choices lets them live in the lap of luxury in Skyrim&#39;s most famous town. 




Located in the iconic town of Whiterun, the Jorrvaskr mead hall stands as one of the most impressive structures in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Found in the giant overturned longboat, the location stands as the headquarters for the mercenary band known as the Companions. As the oldest building in the town, Jorrvaskr has deep roots in Tamriel&#39;s history. While most will probably use the location as a place to store excess gear, there&#39;s actually a clever way to evict almost everyone from the place with no violence at all.




What makes Skyrim so amazing is the divergent choices that affect the characters&#39; lives in the game. Over the years, people have discovered a multitude of funny Skyrim easter eggs, hidden lore, and different ways to approach virtually every scenario. One user on Reddit took a clever approach to the rest of the residents living in Jorrvaskr to figure out a way to live there alone without having to kill anyone â€” well, at least most of the time.

                  All Versions Of Skyrim Compared To One Another &amp; What&#39;s Changed   Skyrim has been released a number of times over the last decade. Here are the different versions that exist and how they compare to one another.    


 It&#39;s Possible To Be The Lord Of Jorrvaskr In Skyrim Without Killing 
         

While it requires a very specific set of steps and actions, it&#39;s possible to evacuate Jorrvaskr without resorting to dispatching all of the residents. As discovered by the user u/Scared_Divide8626 on Reddit, taking specific steps enables a person to become the sole owner and lord of the storied mead hall. To do so, one must marry Aela while making Ria, Njada, and Vilkas all stewards. Then, it&#39;s possible to convince Athis, Torvar, and Farkas to join the Blades, so they move to the Blades headquarters.




                  Skyrim: How to Get a House in Whiterun For Free   In Skyrim, the player house in Whiterun called Breezehome can be purchased for 5,000 gold. However, there&#39;s a secret way to get it for free.   

Finally, it&#39;s necessary to side with the Stormcloaks, resulting in both Vignar and Brill moving to Dragonsreach. The only character remaining in Jorrvaskr is Tilma, who really acts as a maid for Jorrvaskr more than anything else. Though a bug makes it possible for Skjor to resurrect from the dead, he is supposed to have perished during the quest, &#34;The Silver Hand.&#34;



 Living In Jorrvaskr Is Fairly Easy 
          

Even with hundreds of hours in Skyrim, it&#39;s more than possible that people miss one or more of the quests required to live alone in Jorrvaskr. The first requirement is to actually move in, which luckily occurs fairly early in the game. To do so, it&#39;s necessary to join the Companions, which is done by visiting Jorrvaskr and speaking with the leader of the group, Kodlak Whitemane. This will set out the adventurer on the quests that eventually culminate in getting into the group and getting set up in a small room with a bed and some storage space. This is just the first step in the goal to live there alone with a spouse.






 Meeting The Other Requirements 
          

Once moved in, it&#39;s now possible to put a plan into action. Luckily, the first steps of making Ria, Njada, and Vilkas stewards are fairly straightforward. To do so, it&#39;s required to complete the end of the Companions questline, then speak to the companion while in Jorrvaskr to bring up the steward dialogue option.



For Njada, completion of &#34;Glory of the Dead&#34; will be required, while Vilkas will demand the completion of &#34;Dragon Seekers.&#34;




The second necessary step to recruit Athis, Torvar, and Farkas is similarly easy but requires speaking to Delphine in Riverwood. To do this, it&#39;ll be necessary to complete the Companions quests to enable one to make the NPCs followers, then speak to Delphine to open the dialogue option while they are following. Once this option is taken on all three, they will move out of Jorrvaskr to live in Sky Haven Temple.




The final step to move everyone out of Jorrvaskr is to make the game&#39;s main choice of siding with the Stormcloaks over the Imperials in Skyrim. Making this decision for the conflict will result in Vignar Gray-Mane becoming Jarl and moving to Dragonsreach along with Brill.



 Marrying Aela Is The Final Step 
          

While Tilma the Haggard will remain living in Jorrvaskr, she ultimately ends up being a crucial part of Jorrvaskr as the long-time maid and not really a threat since she isn&#39;t an official Companion. The final step is to marry Aela, though this can also be avoided for roleplay purposes if one doesn&#39;t mind living with a roommate. To marry Aela the Huntress, it&#39;ll be required to complete the Companions questline to the end to obtain the Amulet of Mara from the Temple of Mara. Upon speaking with Aela and obtaining her approval, it&#39;s possible to talk to Maramal to complete the proceedings.

 Skyrim Is More Replayable Than Other Modern Games 
          

Bethesda&#39;s Skyrim will go down as one of the most replayable games in history. This is evident by the continued player base for the game, even though it was released over a decade ago in 2011. Though this certainly isn&#39;t the first time that people have discovered new ways to go about things in the game, it is a testament to just how much content is packed within the fantasy walls of the Bethesda creation as new discoveries are constantly being made, even in 2023.

Indeed, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the most captivating titles to release because of the level of player agency and customization possible for the Dragonborn. Though it&#39;s been out forever at this point, things like finding a way to live alone in Jorrvaskr, Whiterun&#39;s most iconic structure, is a pretty cool role-playing opportunity that most will probably miss, even with hundreds of hours played.
