## Literature Review

As Modern Warfare 3&#39;s release grows closer, there will likely be ways to earn XP the fastest, allowing you to level up weapons and unlock new gear.





As of this time of writing, many methods of earning XP are tied to the open beta of Modern Warfare 3, with several new ways likely to be revealed when the full game is released. However, many of the foundations from this system will still be applicable, even if no level progress from the beta carries over into the official launch. You can expect many events and other promotional content that affects the amount of experience you collect.




                  Will Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Be On Game Pass?   A game pass release for Modern Warfare 3 could significantly expand its audience, and Activision Blizzard has answered questions about plans.    


 How to Get XP Fast in Modern Warfare 3 
          

The best ways to get XP fast are to spend Tokens for extra experience, complete weapon challenges, and follow objectives during a match. Every gun in the game has its own set of goals tied to, like getting a number of headshots or achieving a killstreak of a certain length. Whether you&#39;re wielding a smaller pistol or a larger Assault Rifle MCW loadout in Modern Warfare 3, you&#39;ll want to pay attention to its individual missions for extra experience.



Weapon challenges typically take a longer time to complete than other sources of XP, but they do provide some of the largest pools of experience when done, sometimes offering rewards of around 10,000 XP.







                  Best MTZ-556 Loadout In Modern Warfare 3   The first Assault Rifle you can unlock in the beta for Modern Warfare 3 is the MTZ-556, an excellent gun at nearly every range with its best loadout.    

While Tokens were not available to use in the beta, you will be able to spend them as you get into your first matches of Modern Warfare 3 on release day. In the past, these have been gifted to include Double XP, Double Weapon XP, and even Double Battle Pass XP Tokens that all last for a limited time. Once you activate any of these, you should play as many matches as you can to maximize the experience you can farm.

While getting the most kills may seem like a quick solution for XP, following the objectives of a match will yield far more experience. A great example of this comes from the Ground War mode, which gives you XP bonuses for capturing areas. The fastest ways to earn XP in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 are tied to success on the battlefield, encouraging you to cooperate with your team to get the best results.
