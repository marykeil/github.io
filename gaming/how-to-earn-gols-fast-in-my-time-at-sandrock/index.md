## Literature Review

Your main source of money in My Time At Sandrock are Gols, a currency you can earn fast by obtaining specific upgrades and keeping up with missions.





The easiest way to collect Gol comes from completing each Mission tied to the main story, especially the ones early in the game. With the Knives Out update to My Time At Sandrock, there is far more story content you can finish for a large amount of Gol as a reward. Side Missions are also worth pursuing for the same reason, so make sure to keep an eye out for a question mark icon on your mini-map that shows the location of optional quests.

 How to Get Gol Fast in My Time At Sandrock 
          

There are three ways to best get Gol fast in My Time At Sandrock, from selling crafted materials based on their Market Price, having certain character upgrades, and following Daily Commissions. Items sell for a much higher price when raw resources have been built into simple tools. If you create a simple item like a Grinding Saw or Thin Thread using minimal materials, you can sell them for a lot of Gol if they are in demand.



The Market Price Multiplier affects how much a vendor will pay you in Gol for a specific item. The types of materials this applies to change every day, but can range from a 70% minimum of the original price to a 130% boost over the normal cost.







You are able to travel to the Commission Board to receive daily tasks in the Commerce Guild building for some easy Gol. These are basic tasks that you can take on, with your character having the ability to take on more than one later as you continue to progress in the game. Not only can you farm a bunch of money from these objectives, but you can also advance romance options in My Time At Sandrock by taking jobs from relationship NPCs.

According to TheGameGuides.com, there are a few improvements from the Knowledge skill Tree that let you receive Gol at a faster rate when doing the other tasks mentioned. Quick Delivery Knowledge lets you take 5% more rewards from a Commission, while Quality Bonus Knowledge gives you 10% increased earnings from those same goals when you produce goods of a high quality in My Time At Sandrock.

Finally, the Chart-Topper Knowledge greatly increases your collected Gol when you place in the top 3 rankings of the Commerce Guild. This may be the hardest way to earn Gol fast in My Time At Sandrock, but this will become attainable as you become familiar with how the market works in the town.
