## Literature Review

The Game Awards is just around the corner, which means it&#39;s also the season of major reveals, and there are a few that players want to hear from.




The Game Awards 2023 is nearly here, which means it’s also the season of new game reveals. The show is famous for featuring some of the most significant announcements of the year, rivaling the status that E3 once held. The Game Awards has garnered tens of millions of viewers in recent years, making it one of the best times for studios to show off their titles to players. It only makes sense that this year will continue that trend, and it stands to be one of the most exciting years yet, with tons of high-profile games on deck for release in 2024.
For transparency, Screen Rant is part of the TGA 2023 judging panel. 

Geoff Keighley consistently capitalizes on his numerous connections in the industry to put on a show that players look forward to every year, one that celebrates games that have come out and those that are forthcoming. Some of the biggest games in recent years have been featured as world premieres during past The Game Awards ceremonies. Titles such as Alan Wake 2 and Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon debuted between awards, and notable trailers have been premiered for games like Mass Effect 5 and Elden Ring, the GOTY winner for 2022. Given the number of previously rumored and teased games, The Game Awards 2023 is shaping up to host massive reveals.
            
 
 The Game Awards 2023 Livestream Date, Times, &amp; What To Expect 
The Game Awards 2023 is the biggest awards ceremony celebrating the best games of the year. Here are all the details viewers need to know.












 








 10  Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer Is Anticipated For December 
Rockstar Games


 







  Grand Theft Auto 6  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , PC , Xbox Series X     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games     Genre(s)    Adventure , Open-World    


It would be an understatement to say that Grand Theft Auto 6 is the most anticipated game ever. Ten years after the release of GTA 5, Rockstar has officially confirmed that GTA 6 is finally coming, with a trailer that is set to be shared in early December. The Game Awards is the biggest industry event taking place in that time frame, so it’s a safe bet to assume that GTA 6 will debut during this year’s show. However, Rockstar certainly doesn’t need to rely on external events to successfully release new info about the game.





 9  Death Stranding 2 Is A Working Title 
Kojima Productions
        

  Death Stranding 2  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment     Genre(s)    Adventure    


Death Stranding 2 was announced during last year’s TGA ceremony, but not much else has been heard about the title since. The game seems to be still early in development, as the trailer clarified Death Stranding 2 is only a working title. Still, Geoff Keighley’s friendship with Hideo Kojima is well-documented, which means that news from Kojima Productions is never out of the question when it comes to The Game Awards.





 8  God Of War DLC Was Rumored 
Santa Monica Studio


 







  God of War Ragnarok  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment     Genre(s)    Adventure , Action    


Rumors of a DLC for God of War Ragnarok have been circulating for quite some time, with speculation that an official announcement could come in 2023. The year is nearly over, and Santa Monica Studio has been radio silent. However, The Game Awards is an excellent final chance to reveal a DLC for the game if it truly is in being developed, which would undoubtedly delight fans craving more from the franchise.







 7  Ghost Of Tsushima 2 Is Rumored To Be In Development 
Sucker Punch Productions
        

While there has yet to be an official confirmation for Ghost of Tsushima 2, a sequel is almost certainly being developed at Sucker Punch Studios. The first game was a massive success, so it only makes sense that another is in the works, but it would likely be very early in development if this is the case. It would also make sense for a game of this caliber to be saved as a showstopper for the next PlayStation showcase, but The Game Awards also stands out as a perfect time for an official reveal trailer.





 6  Marvel’s Wolverine Will Be Set In Insomniac&#39;s Spider-Man Universe 
Insomniac Games
        

Excitement for Marvel’s Wolverine has been high since its announcement in 2021, and it has only grown since Insomniac clarified it will be set in its Spider-Man universe. Wolverine release date rumors suggest the game could launch in 2024. If this is true, then The Game Awards 2023 would be an excellent time for an official reveal or another trailer showing signs of life from the development. However, Insomniac is still hot off the heels of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, so it seems more likely to want more space between its games.





 5  Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree Expansion Was Announced In February 
FromSoftware


 







  Elden Ring  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Released    February 25, 2022     Publisher(s)    Bandai Namco Entertainment     Genre(s)    Action , RPG    


It’s no secret that Geoff Keighley has a fantastic relationship with FromSoftware, having showcased a few of the studio’s titles at past TGA ceremonies. Add this to the fact that Elden Ring won GOTY last year, and the result is a perfect opportunity for a trailer for Shadow of the Erdtree. The expansion has been highly anticipated even before it was officially announced to be in development earlier this year, but not many details have been heard since. This year’s ceremony could likely be when a trailer is finally revealed, and maybe even a release date.





 4  The Outer Worlds 2 Was Announced In 2021 
Obsidian Entertainment
        

The Outer Worlds 2 was announced in 2021 with a hilarious meta-style trailer, pointing out that pretty much the only thing that’s been settled with the game’s development is its title. This game is likely quite far away, assuming that Microsoft will want some separation between its two big space RPG franchises. Moreover, Obsidian is undoubtedly hard at work with several games in development and the next title being Avowed, which will hopefully be released sometime in 2024. Still, getting an update on The Outer Worlds 2 would be great.





 3  Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2&#39;s Trailer Debuted In 2019 
Ninja Theory
        

Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 has been in development for quite a long time, having received its initial reveal trailer in 2019. Thankfully, the studio behind the game, Ninja Theory, announced during Xbox’s 2023 showcase that Hellblade 2 will launch in 2024. So, it’s reasonable to assume that it is nearly finished and may be going through a rigorous play-testing phase, just as Starfield did. It will undoubtedly be a top priority for Xbox, so it will likely receive a huge marketing push, and it would be wise to kick that off with a release date announcement at The Game Awards 2023.





 2  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin Is A Darker Take On TMNT 
Black Forest Games
        

Realistically, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin may be quite far from release. The game was announced earlier this year with no official release window but came with some exciting details to give players plenty to look forward to. The story will be based on the graphic novel of the same name, sporting a darker, mature tone. It will also feature action gameplay similar to the recent God of War titles. Superhero action games generally always do well, but with titles like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 achieving massive success, it would be awesome if more information on TMNT: The Last Ronin was released to capitalize on that buzz.





 1  Silent Hill 2 Remake Is In The Works 
Bloober Team
        

  Silent Hill 2 Remake  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5     Publisher(s)    Konami     Genre(s)    Survival Horror    


There has been little to no news about the Silent Hill 2 Remake since it was officially announced last year, which has reasonably caused concern among the fans. Many speculate the project is in dire straits, but Bloober Team and Konami are, in all likelihood, taking the time to ensure the game lives up to the massive expectations. That said, it has been over a year since the announcement, which already showcased the game in a reportedly near-complete state. A new trailer and release date is bound to be announced at any minute, and The Game Awards 2023 is the perfect time to do so.
The Game Awards has grown impressively each successive year, becoming one of, if not the most significant events for the industry. It has become synonymous with jaw-dropping reveals and exciting updates. With the number of projects that have been in the works for a while, it stands to reason that 2024 could be an even better year for games than 2023, and there isn’t a better place to celebrate that optimism than The Game Awards.
