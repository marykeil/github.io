Sourcing electricity from non-polluting power plants such as Wind Turbines, Solar Power Plants, Hydroelectric Power Plants, and Geothermal Power Plants will reduce Ground Pollution. However, they tend to produce less power compared to fossil fuels. Other than that, it’s recommended that you keep your garbage services up and running and use Incineration Plants and Recycling Centers to process garbage.






An Industrial Waste Processing Site will reduce overall Ground Pollution by 15%; however, it can be expensive to buy and build.
