## Literature Review

GTA 6 contains an impressive level of detail in its rendering of real-world locations. Here are nine Florida landmarks that have appeared in trailers.




Grand Theft Auto 6 incorporates many real Miami landmarks. The game&#39;s first trailer revealed that GTA 6&#39;s setting is Vice City, a highly realistic recreation of the Miami area. There&#39;s been a lot of speculation about just how big its map will be, much of which is pretty unfounded. However, from what little is already known, GTA 6&#39;s take on Vice City and the surrounding state of Leonida looks pretty ambitious.
GTA games have always been known for their accurate mapping of American cities. That doesn&#39;t just apply to their overarching geography, but also to the real-world locations they include. For those who have never visited the cities that inspire them, there&#39;s a delightful aspect of virtual tourism to GTA. For those who know them well, it&#39;s just fun to look around and point out things they recognize. Whether they&#39;ve never been or they know the Miami area like the back of their hand, there are a lot of faithful recreations for players to marvel at in GTA 6. Here are nine that appeared in the first trailer.
            
 
 10 Real-Life Viral Moments Captured In The GTA 6 Trailer 
The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was packed with a ton of interesting scenes, some of which are based on viral real-life moments with a deeper story. 












 








 1  GTA 6 Includes Honda Bridge 
A Broken Railway Bridge Connecting The Florida Keys
        

GTA 6 includes a faithful recreation of Honda Bridge, a now-defunct route connecting Bahia Honda Key with Spanish Harbor Key. Honda Bridge was originally constructed for the Overseas Railway, but was eventually adapted to be suitable for car traffic in 1938. However, the completion of the Bahia Honda Bridge in 1972 made the original Honda Bridge redundant, and it was officially closed that year. Keen-eyed players may have noticed the missing section of the bridge. This isn&#39;t the result of a collapse, but an intentional change made to accommodate boat traffic, as well as to keep curious urban explorers off the dangerously unkempt bridge.







 2  GTA 6 May Extend To Some Of The Florida Keys 
There Are 800 Islands Off The Coast Of Florida - Which Will GTA 6 Include?
        

In the same shot that establishes the Honda Bridge, GTA 6&#39;s trailer provides a look at a couple of smaller islands off the coast of Leonida state. These are probably based on the Florida Keys, but which ones exactly is an entirely different question.
There are 800 Keys in Florida, and the Honda Bridge connects two of them: Bahia Honda Key and Spanish Harbor Key. However, these are a little further out from mainland Florida, and the city of Miami, so their inclusion may not be totally realistic. The Keys shown in the trailer could easily be Key Biscayne or Virginia Key. The geography seems to fit - GTA 6 would just have to move the Honda Bridge up to match.





 3  GTA 6 Will Include A Stadium Based On Kaseya Center 
Home Of The Miami Heat
        

In the backdrop of a single shot showing Lucia riding on the passenger side of a convertible, a lit-up stadium can be seen in the distance. This is likely the Kaseya Center, the largest indoor stadium in the state of Florida. Located on Biscayne Bay, in the heart of Downtown Miami, it&#39;s best known as the home of the Miami Heat, but also houses major concerts, wrestling pay-per-views, MMA events, circuses, theater shows, et cetera. It&#39;s unknown whether players will actually be able to enter GTA 6&#39;s recreation of the Kaseya Center, but it&#39;ll certainly make an impressive addition to Vice City&#39;s skyline.
            
 
 10 Hidden Details You Probably Missed In GTA 6&#39;s First Trailer 
There was a ton that was packed in the minute-and-a-half Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer â€” so much so that there might be a few details you missed. 








 4  GTA 6 Will Let Players Get Stuck In MacArthur Causeway Traffic 
Miami&#39;s Main Artery In GTA 6
        

But what&#39;s the highway Lucia is driving on when she passes GTA 6&#39;s answer to the Kaseya Center? Geographically, it can only be the MacArthur Causeway. The Causeway is best known for bridging the gap between Downtown Miami and Miami Beach - it&#39;s how everyone travels from the city&#39;s administrative and cultural center to its most idyllic beaches. It&#39;s been one of Miami&#39;s largest and most crowded roadways since its completion in 1926, especially since its expansion in 1997. Just don&#39;t try to use it to escape from the police during rush hour traffic.





 5  GTA 6&#39;s First Trailer Showcases Areas Based On The Everglades 
One Of The World&#39;s Most Diverse Ecosystems In GTA 6
        

It&#39;s long been a subject of speculation, but with the first trailer, the rumor was confirmed: GTA 6 will include areas based on the Everglades National Park. This is a large wildlife reserve located west of Miami. It&#39;s one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, and is home to animals as majestic as flamingos and as deadly as alligators. A fanboat is also seen navigating the flooded grasslands in the trailer, which could provide an interesting, alternate vehicle type to drive in GTA 6.





 6  GTA 6 Includes Wynwood-Inspired Street Art 
Based On Miami&#39;s Art District
        

Located north of Downtown Miami is Wynwood, a trendy district known for its art galleries and upscale boutiques. However, what makes it an especially popular tourist destination is its abundance of street art: many of Wynwood&#39;s buildings are covered in colorful graffiti, turning the entire neighborhood into a photo-op hot spot. Murals inspired by Wynwood&#39;s street art are seen briefly in the GTA 6 trailer, as displayed in the screenshot above.
            
 
 Everyone&#39;s Saying The Same Thing About GTA 6&#39;s Trailer 1 
GTA 6&#39;s first trailer showcased its Florida-inspired location and the eccentric citizens that inhabit it, with many comparing them to a popular meme.








 7  GTA 6 Will Let Players Lounge On North Miami Beach 
The Heart Of Miami&#39;s Tourism Industry


 







Of course, Vice City wouldn&#39;t be complete without its beaches. Miami Beach forms the basis for the crowded, resort-lined shores that appear in the beginning of GTA 6&#39;s trailer. This is the beating heart of Miami&#39;s tourist industry - a nine-mile stretch of white sands, lapped by turquoise waters and staked by brightly-colored umbrellas. This appears to be the northern part of Miami Beach, and is likely based directly on some of its more crowded seaside areas: perhaps Surfside Beach or Hallandale Beach in particular. These tend to run together, though, so it&#39;s safer to say it&#39;s just based on the entire island of Miami Beach.





 8  GTA 6 Will Let Players Cruise South Beach&#39;s Ocean Drive 
        

Miami Beach also has a nightlife district, South Beach, which is centered on the neon lights and Art Deco hotels of Ocean Drive. In the GTA 6 trailer, South Beach is portrayed as a treasure trove of rare, expensive cars just waiting to be hijacked. It includes buildings inspired by the real-life Colony and Breakwater Hotels. In the distance, the sign for the Oceanview Hotel, the setting of the original GTA: Vice City, is also visible.





 9  Panorama Tower Completes Vice City&#39;s Skyline 
Miami&#39;s Tallest Building Makes A Cameo In GTA 6
        

Miami&#39;s tallest building, the mixed-use Panorama Tower, can be seen in the backdrop for much of the GTA 6 trailer. It&#39;s unknown whether it&#39;ll be open to the public or factor into the plot, but the drama around its real-life construction would make for some interesting in-game tension. Panorama Tower was almost left unfinished due to the Great Recession, but the project was later revived and completed in 2018. It certainly towers ominously over the rest of Vice City, and could make for a good villain&#39;s lair or the site of a climactic confrontation.
Those are all the Miami locations seen in GTA 6 so far, but there&#39;ll almost certainly be more in the full game. The first trailer has already proven that there&#39;s an impressive level of detail in its rendering in Vice City, both in real locations and new inventions. More real-world neighborhoods, buildings, and landmarks will be revealed closer to Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s 2025 release.
