## Literature Review

December 8th’s Wordle answer can be solved in less than six attempts if players use the game’s hard mode or refer to the provided hints.





Wordle’s hard mode is not as hard as the name suggests, but it can still be time-consuming. This mode does not let you reuse confirmed letters in other spots, which might work in your favor when trying to solve difficult Wordles. Having said that, there might be a point where you might need some clues, especially if you are running out of attempts fast.
