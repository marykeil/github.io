## Literature Review

Inkay is a weird Pokemon to evolve in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, turning into a Malamar if you use an old trick from previous games.





Inkay are ubiquitous pocket monsters to find in the Coastal Biome quadrant of Blueberry Academy in the expanded content. This area can be fine-tuned to include rare starter Pokémon in Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk, but you don&#39;t need to do this to find an Inkay. You also do not need items bought for Blueberry Points (BP) to evolve an Inkay you catch from the wild.






Inkays have a 35.2% catch rate in the wild, making them a fairly easy creature for you to obtain if you have an Ultra Ball or another Pokéball designed to work well on Dark-/Psychic-type Pokémon.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 2 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   The iconic Gold, Silver, &amp; Crystal starter Pokémon Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile return for you to find and catch in the Indigo Disk DLC.

The only way to evolve Inkay into Malamar in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC is to turn your console upside-down as the Pokémon reaches Level 30. This may seem like a strange solution, but it is actually the same way players would flip their 3DS to trigger Inkay&#39;s evolution in previous games. Ensure you use JoyCons and no controller to make this process far easier.




If you have your Nintendo Switch in its dock, take it out and attach your JoyCons so that your console can register the sudden turn. Rotate your device the moment you see your Inkay hit Level 30, and wait for the cutscene that occurs whenever a Pokémon evolves in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. This is done best through an item like a Rare Candy instead of through an intense battle that may demand your entire focus.

Mistakes during this step can be easily corrected, as you can try again whenever Inkay levels up. The Dark-/Psychic-type Malamar evolved from Inkay can be a powerful member of your roster to challenge the toughest trainers seen in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.
