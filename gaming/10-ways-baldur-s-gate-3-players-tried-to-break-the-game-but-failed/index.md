## Literature Review

For every awful idea a Baldur’s Gate 3 player has, the game has an answer. Here are 10 ways players tried to break it, and how the game responds.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a backup plan for just about every asinine thing a player might try to do. It&#39;s a game full of contingencies, with an equal and opposite reaction for every possible action. There are so many ways for a campaign to recover in case an important dice roll goes poorly, a vital NPC gets killed, or indispensable quest items go missing.
But Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players are creative. Against all odds, they keep finding new and improved ways to break the game - and in such a reactive RPG with so many different choices, the attempts keep coming. However, it seems every time, the developers have an answer. These are ten different ways that players tried to get one over on Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, only to find that the game was one step ahead.
            
 
 10 Hidden Baldur&#39;s Gate Mechanics Most Players Will Never Discover 
Baldur’s Gate 3 explains a lot in its tutorials, but you have to experiment to find some of its hidden mechanics. We’ve done the work for you.












 








 10  Quill Grootslang 
A Dark Urge failsafe


 







On a Dark Urge playthrough, Tav is first confronted with their murderous impulse when the tiefling bard Alfira, down on her luck, appears at camp and asks if she can spend the night. In the morning, they wake up to a bloody scene: Alfira has been killed during the night. There are ways to save Alfira in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but what if she dies, by accident or intent, before this scene can play out? As it turns out, BG3 has a backup for Alfira, a secret dragonborn character named Quill Grootslang. Of course, she meets the same fate as Alfira, so she won&#39;t stick around for long either way.





 9  Losing A Netherstone 
A surefire way to get a bad ending in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3
        

Many possible endings in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 require the collection of three Netherstones, but as it turns out, there&#39;s a failsafe for that, too. It&#39;s not the best result, but if the party happens to drop, sell, or simply misplace one of the Netherstones, they&#39;ll be treated to a special ending. In it, the Emperor chastises Tav for their foolishness, and all the parasite-infected characters immediately undergo ceremorphosis. It&#39;s one of the worst endings in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but its inclusion does prove that Larian covered its bases.





 8  Boundary Breaks 
Looking beyond the borders of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3
        

Boundary breaks can often reveal objects that developers didn&#39;t intend for players to see. One Baldur&#39;s boundary break reveals a surreally salacious secret just out of the player&#39;s view. On the character customization screen, several default characters are loaded in outside the fixed camera&#39;s boundary. The idea is for each of them to be rotated in as the player selects a particular character creation choice in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, reducing the loading time required to render each one individually. The twist is, they&#39;re all completely naked until the player selects them. If players can achieve it, the visual is hilarious: an army of naked, buff men waiting in the wings.





 7  Not Recruiting Shadowheart 
One Origin character will follow Tav to the end of the world


 







While recruiting most Origin characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is totally optional, Shadowheart carries an important artifact that players must receive in order to progress the main quest. So what happens if Tav repeatedly refuses to let her join the party? Shadowheart will keep following them, popping up at the most inopportune moments, like in the middle of the Goblin Camp. She&#39;ll pout like a sad puppy, asking repeatedly to join and insisting that Tav needs her, until they finally acquiesce.





 6  Resurrecting Companions 
They&#39;re not too happy with Tav
        

The ability to resurrect playable characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is, in many ways, the ultimate failsafe. As long as they&#39;ve got the cash, players can theoretically kill and revive their companions as often as they like. Just don&#39;t expect them to be happy about it. In their initial dialogue after reviving them, they&#39;ll yell at Tav for their misplaced violence. In some cases, this dialogue varies situationally, like when Astarion dies in the solar lance trap at Rosymorn Monastery. In this case, players are treated to an amusing scene in which an enraged Astarion laboriously tries to explain that vampires are weak to sunlight.





 5  Karlach Loses Her Head 
&#39;Tis but a scratch
        

If players are following the game&#39;s guidelines, they&#39;re either supposed to recruit Karlach, or deliver her head to Anders as proof of her death. But as it turns out, Karlach can still be resurrected after Tav takes her head. Thankfully, she doesn&#39;t even seem to notice it&#39;s missing - she can think, speak, and move as usual, and goes about the rest of the game just a head shorter. This can also be done without killing Karlach, by pickpocketing the head from her inventory during the first encounter.





 4  What If Tav Kills Zevlor? 
Some BG3 failsafes go surprisingly deep


 







At the end of Act One, as long as they killed all the goblin leaders, Tav will be approached by the grateful tiefling leader Zevlor, who invites them to a good old-fashioned party. However, Zevlor can be killed before this point, and if he is, someone will need to take his place. If Zevlor dies before the party, a new tiefling named Asharak will appear, announce he&#39;s taking over for Zevlor, and invite the party to celebrate as usual.





 3  What If Tav Kills Zevlor And Asharak? 
A backup for a backup
        

But what if Tav kills Zevlor and Asharak before the party? As it turns out, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a backup plan for that, too. It introduces yet another tiefling character, Cerys, who&#39;s apparently third in the line of succession. Unless Zevlor and Asharak both die, Cerys isn&#39;t programmed to appear until Act Two, so it&#39;s impossible to kill her before the party scene without using mods or exploits. But as a matter of fact, Tav can kill all the tieflings in the encampment and still see the party scene; Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a backup character for every single one.





 2  Killing The Whole Party 
Possible, if not advisable
        

Solo playthroughs, or so-called Lone Wolf runs of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, are totally possible. This can be done either by refusing to recruit any other characters, leaving them at camp, or outright killing them to remove temptation. Players can beat Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 with only Tav in the party, as long as they take Shadowheart&#39;s artifact at some point. However, these runs can be exceptionally boring. Without companion quests, combat mechanics, or romances, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can feel like a chore.





 1  Animal Ending 
A rare epilogue brings out the BG3 party&#39;s wild side
        

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 provides many opportunities for the party to take the shapes of wild animals, but if one of them is triggered at the right time, its effects can last into the epilogue. Sorcerers with the Wild Magic feature can trigger a surge with random effects, and one of them can turn the entire party into a group of cats and dogs. If this effect is triggered near the end of the final battle, all the game&#39;s epilogues will play out with the characters still in animal form. It&#39;s a rare ending with a miniscule chance of occurring, but its existence proves that Larian left nothing up to chance.
Those are some of the most interesting ways in which players have already tried to break the game, but there are almost certainly more. Secret Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 scenes are constantly being found, even with the conditions to trigger them still unknown. As more and more oversights and missing features are patched out, players will surely find new and uniquely entertaining ways to break Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and the game will find new ways to respond.
