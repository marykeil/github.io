## Literature Review

To experience everything new Minecraft 1.20 has to offer, you can use custom seeds to generate worlds with stunning views and lots of resources.





Strings of numbers designate individual seeds, allowing you to create worlds based on amazing places found by others. A world seed determines where you spawn, what biomes are present, and even the location of some structures. Whether you are looking for the best seed for Villages in Minecraft or somewhere with rare structures like Mansions or Ancient Cities, you&#39;ll want to use a certain seed.

 10  The Meadow (Java Edition) 
Seed: -1855749200417028125
        

Massive grassland biomes can be suited for beginners to Minecraft, with The Meadow seed here having various resources close to your spawn to support this idea. A Pillager Outpost to the south and a Village directly east of where you start may give you the tools to jump-start your adventure. While it may be difficult to raid the Outpost in Survival Mode, the supplies you could get outweigh the risk. 
Seeds and world generation can differ between Minecraft’s Java and Bedrock Editions. In some cases, seeds may work in both editions, but players may also find substantial differences. 

If you decide to journey south, you will also find many exciting places underground, including a giant cave carved into the mountains. An extensive system of labyrinthine tunnels descends through the stone until you reach an Abandoned Mineshaft, a rare structure in Minecraft. In addition, you could also uncover an Ancient City filled with secrets and loot for you to explore. 





 9  The Jungle (Java Edition) 
Seed: -5798978995584557352
        

When you start in this seed, you are immediately next to four different biomes: a birch forest, dense jungle, savannah hills, and a rare mangrove swamp nearby. The small cluster of distinct regions makes this world great for immediately collecting many unique resources. For example, Mangrove Propagules in Minecraft are an uncommon material only produced in the mangrove swamp biome.
Other resources, such as cocoa pods and melons from the jungle, combined with rare mobs only tamed in these areas, like pandas and ocelots in Minecraft. You spawn in a place high up in a mountain, which is perfect for a starting base for the view and some protection against hostile mobs. Venturing into the ocean below will lead you to a shipwreck and ocean monument for more items to collect. 





 8  The Cherry Blossom Hills (Java Edition) 
Seed: 892109490596939519


 







The best Cherry Blossom seeds in Minecraft decorate the land with luscious pink biomes that give a level of beauty that this world embodies. Below a snowy mountain, you&#39;ll find this unique forest type and a cave system containing an Abandoned Mineshaft and an Ancient City. Feel free to use the Cherry Blossom trees as a starting spot for your base as you prepare to delve underground to discover these rare structures. 





 7  The Island Mansion (Java Edition) 
Seed: 6960347577965979123
        

Found by user u/ElegantComplaint7795 on Reddit, this seed has you start on top of a Woodland Mansion that takes up most of the island it rests on. Three shipwrecks in the surrounding waters will give you some materials needed to invade this Mansion and fight the mobs. While it may be hard to defeat every enemy in the structure, the absurd amount of space in the building makes it an awesome base in Minecraft. 
Evokers are rare hostile mobs that have a chance to spawn inside a Woodland Mansion. If you defeat this creature, it may drop a Totem of Undying, which saves you from death just once. 






 6  The Valley Village (Java Edition) 
Seed: 1063292310985219505
        

Discovered by user u/stofix_ on Reddit, the world created with this seed places you at the edge of an enormous ring of mountains that protect a hidden valley. A Cherry Blossom grove rests below, with a Village nestled within the woods to create a picturesque civilization resting in the pink leaves. Several caves with abandoned mineshafts in this area even have diamonds, a notorious and powerful resource in Minecraft. 





 5  The Desert And The Badlands (Bedrock Edition) 
Seed: 7129728634131048802


 







This seed puts you in a place where a Badlands and Desert biome converge, making an arid world suited for those looking for a sand-sprawling adventure. Three Desert Temples at coordinates (42, 69, 285), (42, 64, 702), and (-308, 64, 670) give you immediate places to explore for valuable resources in Minecraft. New archeology systems in the 1.20 update make these locations even more interesting.
If you continue to the savannahs beyond the desert, you&#39;ll also find a Village that you can use as a place to store the items you harvest from each Temple. You can trade many of the materials you find from the structures you explore with different villagers in this Minecraft seed. 





 4  The Mushroom Islands (Bedrock Edition) 
Seed: 4054696202985189949
        

Even though many other seeds mentioned will put you close to a Village, very few spawn you inside of one, making this world special. The Taiga biome you begin in sits next to a large ocean leading out to Mushroom Field islands, an extremely rare biome where Mycelium replaces grass and dirt blocks. Giant mushrooms grow like trees in these secluded landscapes, providing abundant ingredients for food in Minecraft.
One of the reasons a Mushroom Field is a vital biome to discover is how it interacts with hostile mobs in Minecraft. No enemy creatures can spawn on a Mushroom Field biome, with only passive Mooshrooms, or Mushroom Cows, appearing instead. The milk and food cultivated by these animals combine with a sense of safety from enemy mobs to make an ideal setting for a base. 





 3  The Cherry Blossom Grove (Bedrock Edition) 
Seed: 2804787458819293032


 







Another great Cherry Blossom seed with Minecraft&#39;s 1.20 update, this world has the largest forest seen yet for crafting materials. Spanning a length of hundreds of blocks, the wood and space here give an abundant level of freedom to pick and choose where to build your base. A big sinkhole in this area has an extensive cave system you can explore for more resources, including an Ancient City at the bottom. 
Cherry Blossom biomes host new Bee mobs, whose Nests can be contained to create one of the best farms for important materials in Minecraft.  






 2  The Valley Village (Bedrock Edition) 
Seed: 757067671151835873
        

Reddit user u/Fragrant_Result_186 discovered this seed is similar to the Valley Village with its familiar Cherry Blossom and snowy mountain setting. However, this world has an interesting twist since it features five Blacksmith buildings in the Village. These locations have functional utility blocks for smelting ore and improving various weapons and armor you craft throughout your journey in Minecraft.
A nearby Pillager Outpost stands no chance against you once you arm yourself with the many tools found at each Blacksmith house. This seed is fantastic for those looking for an Adventure Mode map, since it really feels like you are embarking on quests from a central hub in Minecraft. Dense forests around the tall mountains also invite you to travel more to track down other structures and landmarks in the world. 





 1  The Mansion And The Caves (Bedrock Edition) 
Seed: 199
        

Discovered by Reddit user u/JVFA5GCGWF, this world generates one of the rarest cave biome combinations seen in any 1.20 seed in the update so far. A Lush Cave rests almost on top of an Abandoned Mineshaft in a sinkhole at coordinates (-5929, 65, -5113) far from your spawn. The effort to reach this spot is more than worth it, giving you access to dozens of rare materials. 
There’s also a Woodland Mansion close by at (-6083, 65, -5007) that players can explore. 

The random generation of the best 1.20 Minecraft seeds can create one in a million landscapes like the ones mentioned here, so take advantage of these fantastic worlds and see what they offer.
