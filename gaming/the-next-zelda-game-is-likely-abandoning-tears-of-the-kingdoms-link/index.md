# The Next Zelda Game Is Likely Abandoning Tears Of The Kingdoms Link


## SUMMARY 



  Tears of the Kingdom may be the last game with this version of Link, signaling a possible retirement for the character.   A new Hyrule in future Zelda games means new characters and a fresh story, saying farewell to the current version of Link.   The absence of planned DLC for Tears of the Kingdom suggests that the developers consider the game complete and ready to move on to a new chapter.

## Literature Review

It seems that the next Zelda game will most likely feature a new incarnation of Link, leaving behind Tears of the Kingdom’s depiction of the hero.




It is likely that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be the last Zelda game to feature its particular version of Link. TOTK is a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, and because of this, it features and further develops the same incarnation of the famous hero. However, looking towards the future of the franchise, it may soon be time for TOTK’s Link to retire.




There have been many different versions of Link over the years, although his appearance rarely varies. In fact, BOTW and TOTK have made their Link instantly recognizable by wearing a blue tunic as opposed to the more traditional green. But at the same time, other aspects of his design remain familiar, such as his blonde hair and blue earrings. Similarly, Link never talks to anybody in cutscenes, although dialogue options in both BOTW and TOTK do imply that he does speak to NPCs at times. Between the two games, people have become very familiar with this particular Link’s personality. Nevertheless, the next Zelda game may introduce a completely unfamiliar Link.

                  The Next Zelda Game Needs To Bring Back The Series’ Best Tradition   A classic Legend of Zelda tradition has been absent in recent games, and as a result it would be perfect for it to be revived in the next title.   


 The Next Zelda Game May Have A New Hyrule 
          




In a recent interview with Game Informer, The Legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma revealed that he considers TOTK’s Hyrule to be the “apotheosis” of the current era of the franchise, the very pinnacle of what it can be. As such, he sees the creation of a direct sequel to Tears of the Kingdom as very unlikely. If the franchise does indeed move on to another incarnation of Hyrule, this will allow for a new story to be told without relying on the background and continuity created by the previous two titles. But at the same time, this also means saying farewell to the current version of Link.



 A New Hyrule Will Replace Many Popular Zelda Characters 
         

A new Hyrule logically requires a new version of the Zelda series’ iconic hero to save it. On the whole, it is a bittersweet fact; although this means new directions can be explored, the current Link, who arguably has the most well-developed backstory and character of all of The Legend of Zelda’s protagonists to date, will ultimately be left behind. Of course, this is also true for other characters like Zelda; the princess has suffered immensely in both BOTW and TOTK, but has also become a far stronger and more interesting person as a result. However, for better or worse, the next Princess Zelda will have none of this development.




Additionally, given the time that can occur between Zelda games, it is entirely possible that most or all characters from TOTK will no longer be a part of Hyrule in the next entry (assuming that the franchise doesn’t shift to another timeline entirely). While the Sheikah and Zora have been shown to have notably extensive lifespans, most of Hyrule’s other races do not live nearly as long. This means that the next Hyrule could truly be a clean slate, with the possible exception of inclusions like an elderly Sidon or the Great Deku Tree.


 

Although Aonuma lack of truly definitive wording does leave a small possibility for TOTK’s Link to return in a subsequent title, it does not seem very likely. The fact that no DLC has been planned for TOTK emphasizes the fact that the developers feel that the game is complete as it is, with no need for follow-up content. As such, it is probable that the next Zelda game after The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will depict a Hyrule far removed from the events of the Upheaval, with a new Link and his allies facing whatever evil may arise to threaten his home.
