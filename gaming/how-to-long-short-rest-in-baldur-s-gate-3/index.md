## Literature Review

Rest is an essential part of adventuring in RPGs. In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players can use Long and Short rests to replenish health and resources.





There is a time element to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and some time will pass in-game when a player chooses to take a rest. In addition, when the player chooses a short rest, only a portion of their character and companions&#39; health, spell slots, and resources will return. This can preserve some potions and other consumables for more dire situations. When players make camp and take a long rest, HP, abilities, and spells will fully be restored. Players can rest any time they are not in an active combat situation.

Short Rest
Short rests in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are especially useful when the party needs to replenish health and resources after a fight but may not be ready to return to camp with their companions and spend time on a Long rest. To Short rest in the game, players will need to click the closed-eyes icon to the right of the minimap.

This will cause 15 minutes to pass in the game and will restore about half of their HP and certain spells and abilities. There are a few spells and abilities that can only be restored with a Long rest, however, so players will need to double-check and be certain the ones they want to use can be replenished with a Short rest.






The party is limited in their Short rests before they will be required to stop for a Long rest. Once their Short rests have been used, the option will not be clickable until after the next Long rest.




Long Rest
Long rests in the game will return the player&#39;s party to camp and fully restore health and resources. To do this, outside of a combat situation, the player can click on the campfire icon that says &#34;Go to Camp and End the Day,&#34; also located to the right of the minimap.

Once at camp, the player will need to click on a bedroll or the campfire to complete the rest. This will take about eight hours of in-game time and will move the player to the next day. While at camp, players can speak to their companions and get to know them a little bit better. This is also the way to work toward beginning a romance with any of the party members, and players can experience some deeper, character-driven moments while at camp after a day of adventuring.
