## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2&#39;s extended trailer reveals that there will be two exciting additions to the all-star cast of reality TV legends coming soon.




The Traitors US season 2&#39;s extended trailer revealed two surprise new cast members of epic proportions, though their capacity on the series hasn&#39;t been revealed. After the exciting premiere episodes of The Traitors US season 2 dropped, fans have been clamoring for more of the star-studded reality TV all-star cast. Bringing together reality TV stars from all different franchises, the series is giving viewers an inside look into a game of drama and deception when played by the best in the business. With stars spanning from The Challenge&#39;s Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio to Big Brother&#39;s Janelle Pierzina to RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race&#39;s Peppermint, the caliber of players is at an all-time high.




In its extended trailer, The Traitors US season 2&#39;s cast is expanded by two exciting surprise reality TV legends. Peacock&#39;s newest trailer reveals that Below Deck &amp; The Traitors US season 1 star Kate Chastain will return to the castle along with Big Brother legend Dr. Will Kirby. According to Twitter&#39;s Sharon Tharp, &#34;Kate Chastain is returning to the game to play, Dr. Will is being called a &#34;special guest.&#34;&#34;


 

Kate is the first person revealed in the trailer, with host Alan Cumming explaining, &#34;there&#39;s a new guest in my castle,&#34; as Kate drops her bags in the foyer. Met with shock from the rest of the cast, Kate asks at a round table, &#34;tell me everything! Who do we hate?&#34; Moments later, Dr. Will is shown sitting on a porch ominously with dogs at his feet. &#34;Is that Dr. Will,&#34; someone asks in a voice-over as Will smirks, presumably at the cast.





 What To Expect From The Traitors US Season 2 
          

While their roles on the series have yet to be revealed, Kate and Dr. Will&#39;s appearances are shocking pieces of the puzzle that weren&#39;t expected to be part of the game. Kate, who appeared on The Traitors US season 1 as a faithful known for her cut-and-dry attitude, is coming into the game as a player, but could be presented as though she&#39;s there to consult with the cast about the way they&#39;re navigating the competition. Her presence at the round table is supplemented by an interview segment where she shares, &#34;I know you all missed me,&#34; to the camera. Kate joining the cast so late could create some friction.


 




While Dr. Will&#39;s role isn&#39;t explained in full, his role being that of a special guest makes it clear he won&#39;t be coming directly into the game. Very little information is shown regarding Dr. Will, but he&#39;s seen in a mysterious shot without any context and someone, presumably The Traitors US stars Tamra Judge or Trishelle Cannatella, asking if that&#39;s him in the distance. It&#39;s unclear if the series will be adding to the cast outright, or if there will be circumstances surrounding the additional cast members. Regardless of the why, the addition of two major reality TV stars to the game is a jaw-dropping twist.

With The Traitors US season 2 still in its earliest phases, there have already been several shocking moments that have been integral to the game. From the initial traitor selection to the recruitment of the third traitor, the cast of the series has been taking everything in stride. The addition of seasoned The Traitors US contestant Kate may be a shock to the system for the cast, who have been able to continue with ease throughout their time on the show. While Kate and Dr. Will&#39;s appearances on The Traitors US season 2 are still shrouded in mystery, it&#39;ll be fascinating to see their presence in the game.
