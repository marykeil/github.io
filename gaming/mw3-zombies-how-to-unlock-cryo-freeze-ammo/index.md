## Literature Review

Cryo Freeze is an Ammo Mod in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies that can freeze the undead in place, but you may have to get lucky to unlock this bullet type.





Usually, you can get Cryo Freeze ammo from Aether Caches or by consuming the Perk-a-Cola flavor called Elemental Pop. You will likely find many different caches as you earn XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies and pursue exfil missions. However, these sources of the Ammo Mod are limited, with only the collection of the item&#39;s Schematics giving you a permanent way to craft Cryo Freeze whenever you want.






Elemental Pop can be found in Perk-a-Cola dispensing machines and makes all of your ammo have random Mod effects when consumed, so your bullets may get additional properties other than Cryo Freeze.




                  &#34;Warfare That Feels Dated&#34; - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Review   Despite fantastic visuals, the campaign for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 fails to push the series forward with gameplay that feels dated.   


 How To Craft Cryo Freeze Ammo In Modern Warfare 3 Zombies 
          

The only way to craft the unique Ammo Mod is to collect the Cryo Freeze Schematics from random Chests or Caches found in places like Infested Strongholds. Unfortunately, the blueprints are dropped by RNG, so no specific locations have the recipe for Cryo Freeze. This process could take some time in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies or a very long series of trial and error.




The best chance to unveil the Cryo Freeze Schematics comes from Aether Nests and Infested Strongholds. These areas are the most dangerous in Urzikstan, hosting multiple waves of zombies in Modern Warfare 3 that could overwhelm you or your squad. Thankfully, all you really need to do is keep dropping onto the map and pray that you&#39;re eventually given the blueprints as a reward.



While Caches and Chests have a chance to drop the Cryo Freeze Schematics, Rift Rewards gifted after story missions and contracts are another good way to find the Ammo Mod plans.




Once you have the Schematics, you can craft as much Cryo Freeze ammo as you wish. This will help you complete the Freezer Burn challenge, which gives you great rewards if you slow 50 zombies and 10 Hellhounds with the Ammo Mod. Those looking to earn lots of Essence in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies should consider unlocking Cryo Freeze to help meet this simple goal.
