# Baldur s Gate 3 s Tav Is Actually The Most Powerful Spellcaster In Faer没n


## SUMMARY 



  The protagonist in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can out-magic even the most advanced spellcasters due to the player&#39;s ability to save scum.   Save scumming in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 mimics the effects of chronomancy, a school of magic not seen in Dungeons &amp; Dragons since its second edition.   The prevalence of save scumming in BG3 suggests that players enjoy the idea of turning back the clock, making a case for the reintroduction of chronomancy in official DnD material.

## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can often feel overwhelming, but one particular trick gives the protagonist a claim to more magical power than any competitor.




There&#39;s no question that a custom Tav in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can grow to become a powerful character, but attaining the title of the mightiest spellcaster in Faer没n might still seem like something of a stretch. The setting of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is rich with magic, as handily exhibited by characters like Elminster, who has far more experience and general esteem than any Tav could dream of. Despite appearances, however, there&#39;s one very good reason that the game&#39;s protagonist can out-magic even the most advanced spellcasters that the Forgotten Realms have seen.




Interestingly, this claim can even apply to martial classes, as the key concept isn&#39;t built around any standard spell feature accessible in the hotbar. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is careful not to go too far with general abilities, capping character progression at level 12 instead of the level 20 that applies in tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons. High-level spells become significantly more difficult to balance and write around, as god-like powers present a terrifying wealth of possibilities in combat. Despite this general rule, there&#39;s one way to use a spell with more impact than anything that Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 officially supports.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Save Scumming Is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Chronomancy 
          




Both DnD and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 have officially left chronomancy in the past, but save scumming in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 mimics the effects of powerful chronomancy with surprising accuracy. This particular spellcasting class was best detailed in the second edition supplement Chronomancer, focusing on time-manipulating possibilities related to a dimension called Temporal Prime. Although Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse recently expanded the extradimensional possibilites of DnD 5e, the powers of the chronomancer still haven&#39;t returned to the game outside of homebrew content and a somewhat similar chronurgist subclass for wizards in Explorer&#39;s Guide To Wildemont.

The chronomancer spells that most directly pertain to save scumming are paradox and minor paradox, sixth- and ninth-level options that would allow the caster to alter specific events that have already occurred. A 5e homebrew implementation of the class available on the D&amp;D Wiki uses Undo Timeline as a similar ability that can rewind events outright, but it restricts the power to level 20 characters, giving a good idea of how unbalanced it can be at lower levels in 5e. In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the same effect can essentially be achieved by reloading a save after something goes wrong, a choice that incurs no consequences within the game.




                  Tony DiTerlizzi on Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse, Yoshitaka Amano, Star Wars &amp; More   Screen Rant discusses D&amp;D&#39;s Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and the setting&#39;s beginnings with veteran illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi.   



 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Chronomancy Breaks The Fourth Wall 
          

Save scumming obviously isn&#39;t an explicitly intended ability of Tav characters, and interest in its usage tends to divide the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 community. There&#39;s certainly value in accepting the consequences of poor decisions and bad luck, and rolling with the punches can add to an overall sense of immersion. On the other hand, the inflexibility of a game without a DM can make it hard to find clever solutions to mitigate mistakes, and a sequence of disappointing rolls can end up wiping out entire groups of NPCs in more than one instance.




In a way, stepping outside the game&#39;s normal format to perform an alteration isn&#39;t that far off from the idea of chronomancy, which similarly moves beyond a standard dimensional structure to break the linearity of time. Breaking the fourth wall is also something of a standard feature in tabletop DnD, where players are prone to making out of character jokes or freezing time to discuss complex plans that occasionally rely on meta-knowledge. A single-player Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaign doesn&#39;t tend to reflect this to the same degree, but having that standard set does make it a little easier to justify an out-of-bounds approach to resolving struggles.



Conserving a few points of Inspiration for critical moments is a great way to avoid save scumming, as most minor mistakes can still be resolved through alternate methods.




For anyone who dislikes reloading saves enough to want a true ironman run, it looks like Larian Studios is set to add a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Honour Mode that will restrict save slots and make Game Overs permanent. Any Honour Mode Tav inherently gives up their claim to chronomantic powers, although finishing a campaign without triggering a Game Over is certainly a testament to a different kind of strength. This respects the brutality of a DnD total party kill and arguably even kicks it up a notch, as there&#39;s no chance of a DM letting the party roll up new characters to drop back in without losing all progress.






 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Shows Why Chronomancy Should Return 
         

The prevalence of save scumming in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 makes it obvious that turning back the clock is a priority for many, even if they have to resort to vaguely illicit methods to do so. Although tossing aside the importance of consequences wouldn&#39;t be good for either Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 or DnD to officially implement, it does point to the fun that can be found in chronomancy. The class has spent a long time collecting dust as recent editions of DnD have passed it by, and finding a valuable way to bring it back beyond the more limited implementation of the chronurgy subclass could be well worth the effort.

DnD will undergo major shakeups in 2024 with the introduction of One D&amp;D, and this could provide the perfect opportunities for chronomancers to be reintroduced in full. It&#39;s also something that could be explored in DLC for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 or a successor to the game, although the ease of save scumming means time-based abilities beyond paradox might be the bigger draw for the class. In any scenario, time is a playground that isn&#39;t currently being fully explored in Faer没n and beyond, and there&#39;s no better way to capitalize on its potential than with chronomancy.




Whether chronomancers ultimately show up again in official material or remain relegated to homebrew content, breaking the rules of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 does inadvertently give its best abilities new life. In a world without chronomancy, the power of a Tav to employ it through unusual means gives them all the more of an edge. Elminster might not be happy to hear it, but spellcasting mastery in Faer没n has a fresh new face, and it&#39;s one that&#39;s all too keen to break the rules of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
