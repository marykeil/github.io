## Literature Review

Hanging out in a bar in Cyberpunk 2077, getting a drink and listening to the conversations, or chatting with the bartender can be an immersive treat.




For many players, Cyberpunk 2077 is best when there is a focus on roleplaying to fully let the immersion of becoming V take over and get lost in the world of Night City and its surrounding areas. The intricate details in the game, as well as the beautiful, yet dark, graphics help to make this possibility a reality. Just walking down the street and listening in on NPC conversations or having a seat at a bar and ordering a drink can all help not only make the game come more alive but also allow players a chance to escape from the real world for a bit and enjoy a different environment in the dystopian future.
This is part of why the various bars that are placed throughout the areas of the game offer a bit of a respite for not only the virtual NPCs, but also for the player. There are many different styles of clubs and bars that provide drastically different vibes, letting each person pick their favorite place to let V relax, listen to some music, and enjoy a drink. Of course, many of the quests in Cyberpunk 2077 also revolve around certain bars and nightclubs, but that doesn&#39;t mean that V can&#39;t have one they call their own to retreat to when they need a bit of a break.
            
 
 10 Best Hidden Secret Events In Cyberpunk 2077 
Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty DLC are full of secret side missions and lore that is hidden away for players to stumble across while playing.












 








 10  Hometown Deli 
Located Near Reconciliation Park


 







For a high-end, rather snobby place to enjoy a bottle of fine wine, the Hometown Deli bar is one of the more ritzy establishments that V can frequent. It has a fancy, but cold feeling in its decor and at night is generally occupied by corpos coming from the Plaza. Aside from the feeling of superiority that the bartender gives when attempting to order a drink, the environment is a calmer place to hang out and can make one feel as though they are of the upper class in the otherwise downtrodden and disheartening world of Night City.





 9  Heavy Hearts Club 
Located In Dogtown
        

For those who have the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077, there are a couple of new places around Dogtown to enjoy. One of these is the Heavy Hearts Club which is the main location for the &#34;Heaviest of Hearts&#34; gig, but is also a beautiful club to simply enjoy. This Egyptian-themed nightclub is a place for the more elite of the Dogtown populous, and is easily recognized from the building being shaped like a glowing pyramid, matching the green lights of the interior.





 8  Lizzie&#39;s Bar 
Located In Kabuki, Watson
        

Cyberpunk 2077 does not shy away from the more sexually explicit parts of this cybernetic dystopian future, as Lizzie&#39;s Bar is clear proof of. This bar is a place where the citizens of Night City can come to receive braindances and see stripteases. It is a very adults-only establishment and features a lot of pink neon and loud music to set the mood. Lizzie&#39;s Bar is also the home of The Mox gang, as the gang was started after a horrific murder took place in Lizzie&#39;s Bar in 2067.





 7  Red Dirt 
Located In Santa Domingo, Arroyo
        

Red Dirt is quite a ways away from most of the main excitement of the city, being tucked near the warehouses of Santa Domingo. What makes this place most notable is that Red Dirt is the location of Johnny Silverhand&#39;s band&#39;s first show. Samurai&#39;s performance there created so much attention that they had to ban people from entering the bar without any clothes on. What makes Red Dirt feel the most special and unique, however, is that it feels like a place that could exist in today&#39;s world. It isn&#39;t overly filled with tech or flashy dance floors, yet it still fits right in with the world of 2077.
            
 
 Why Johnny&#39;s Samurai Reunion Is Cyberpunk&#39;s Best Mission 
The best mission in Cyberpunk 2077 is actually a completely missable quest chain that involves Johnny Silverhand and his rock band, Samurai.








 6  Dark Matter 
Located In Japantown
        

Dark Matter is one of the most expensive and elite clubs in all of Night City. This rooftop club is where celebrities will put on shows and fan meet-ups, and is a highly prestigious place. V cannot even reach Dark Matter until after completing the storyline for Kerry Eurodyne, which opens up the bar for the gig. This club is also the only location where the services of special $3,000 joytoys are purchased.

 5  El Coyote Cojo 
Located In Heywood, The Glen
        

El Coyote Cojo is not a big and fancy elite club, but rather it feels like a bar where everyone knows each other. Owned by Mama Welles, the mother of Jackie Welles, it is a place with quite a bit of significance in the game. Its vibe is more of a relaxed one, with arcade machines and a pool table. There are booths for eating and, of course, friendly staff.





 4  Empathy 
Located North Of Memorial Plaza


 







Like Lizzie&#39;s Bar, Empathy is a braindance club that is located in the City Center of Night City. While it is definitely another adult&#39;s only establishment with stripteases and braindances happening all around, it somehow still manages to be a place that feels classier than Lizzie&#39;s Bar. Appearances can be deceiving, however, as it is a much more explicit place, despite the calming name.





 3  Riot 
Located In Little China


 







Riot is one of the most popular nightclubs in Night City for the music scene. It offers a fantastic stage with a top-of-the-line sound system, a beautiful light show, and a large dance floor that V can even enjoy interacting with. Stars like Lizzy Wizzy, Rubicones, and more have all performed there, and despite being an exclusive club with bouncers, V can simply slide in when the door is open. Unfortunately, many players have been experiencing a glitch in the game recently that prevents entry even when there is a quest that should let V in.

An unfortunate bug has prevented many from getting into a place called The Riot Club in Cyberpunk 2077, blocking you from pursuing certain missions.








 2  Totentanz 
Located In The Northside Industrial District Of Watson
        

From the outside, and until the final moment when V walks into the room where the action is, Totentanz appears to be a completely rundown abandoned building that leaves players wondering if they are in the correct spot. Once the elevator doors open on the top floor, everything changes. The heavy music and red and orange strobing lights feel immediately as though it is a place to dance and let loose. There are even slightly calmer areas up above the dance floor to just relax. The bartender is funny and sarcastic, and the whole place is a surprisingly fun club to enjoy a drink and a dance.





 1  Afterlife 
Located In Little China
        

Afterlife was given its name because, although it has had to move a couple of times over the years, it has always been built on, or in, the remains of morgues. It is legendary for being a solo bar, and is owned by the biggest fixer in Night City, Rogue. Many of the legendary Edgerunners have drinks named after them at the Afterlife. So, if V truly wants to relax in a bar with a great vibe, heading to the Afterlife and ordering a Johnny Silverhand is the best way to experience the social scene of Cyberpunk 2077.
