## Literature Review

A Confessor build in Elden Ring uses holy magic and melee combat to survive devastating attacks, deal lightning damage, and even support allies.





You start with a Broadsword weapon and Finger Seal, an item that lets you cast Incantations very early in your journey. The sword you get is perfect for a balanced character and can be a tool you use through many different adventures. The spells in Elden Ring called Assassin&#39;s Approach and Urgent Heal come with the Confessor and let you start a fight quickly and recover fast, respectively.

 Best Confessor Build Stats 
          

The best stat for a Confessor build is Faith, which starts at a high value when picking the class at the start of Elden Ring. Your other important stats are Strength and Dexterity, which scale with different weapon types found throughout the Lands Between. Vigor should be the next score to think about since it ties directly to how much health your character has at any given moment. 



The Mind and Endurance stats should only be invested in if your build needs to meet a minimum requirement for a powerful item. Faith can also be treated this way, but it will weaken your holy magic as time passes.







You want to level up Strength and Dexterity to the point where you can wield most weapons in one or two hands. Getting at least one of these stats to at least Level 40 should be a priority for a Confessor build, but this is determined by what weapon you use. For example, if you want to use Elden Ring&#39;s best Strength scaling weapons, spending a lot of Runes won&#39;t be necessary to increase your Dexterity.

  Sample Level 30 Confessor Build    Stat   Points    Vigor   20    Mind   13    Endurance   10    Strength   22    Dexterity   12    Intelligence   9    Faith   14    Arcane   9   






  Sample Level 60 Confessor Build    Stat   Points    Vigor   24    Mind   15    Endurance   15    Strength   35    Dexterity   12    Intelligence   9    Faith   20    Arcane   9   



  Sample Level 90 Confessor Build    Stat   Points    Vigor   30    Mind   16    Endurance   20    Strength   40    Dexterity   20    Intelligence   9    Faith   24    Arcane   9   








 Best Weapon and Seal Options for Confessor Builds 
          

Having an equal mix of Strength and Dexterity stats means you can wield a wider variety of weapons than most class builds in Elden Ring. Swords, daggers, and even bows are all viable primary weapons for the Confessor, with shields being another option to make you even more versatile. A Sacred Seal could also replace a standard shield to give you some protection without adding extra Weight.

  Best Sacred Seals for Confessor Builds    Seal Name   Boost    God Slayer&#39;s Seal   Godslaying Incantations    Dragon Communion Seal   Dragon Incantations   






Divine Incantation spells should be a big focus once you get the right Sacred Seal and other tools complimenting the Confessor&#39;s abilities. While you will be adept with magic using this bill, you need to focus on combat more than arcane skills unless you decide to invest some Runes in the Mind stat. Buffs applied by Ashes of War can strengthen your weapons and give them new and powerful traits. 



Don&#39;t forget that you can summon Spirits with your Confessor build to make up for certain weaknesses, especially if you focus on magic more than melee weapons.






 Best Incantations for Confessor Builds 
          

  Incantation   Effect   Location    Black Flame   Throw a black ball of fire at a targeted enemy.   Godskin Prayerbook    Lord’s Heal   Apply massive healing to your character and nearby allies.   Two Fingers’ Prayerbook    Lord’s Aid   Removes Poison, Sleep, and Blood Loss for self and allies.   Two Fingers’ Prayerbook    Lightning Spear   Throw a bolt of lightning to deal lots of damage.   Dragon Cult Prayerbook    Electrify Armament   Enchant your right-hand weapon with lightning damage.   Dragon Cult Prayerbook    Ancient Dragon’s Lightning Spear   Sends down a red lightning spear from above to deal damage.   Ancient Dragon Prayerbook   






If you decide to make holy magic your primary source of damage, remember that spells take time to cast unless you have certain items. This means fast enemies and bosses can be difficult to hit, expending resources for little result in Elden Ring. Be careful to study an enemy&#39;s moves and use magic as they recover from attacks to hit them almost every time with devastating Faith spells. 



 Best Ashes of War for Confessor Builds 
          

  Ash of War   Scaling &amp; Changes   Recommended Skills    Standard Ashes of War   N/A     Mighty Shot   Barrage   Sky Shot   Parry   Storm Wall       Keen Ashes of War   Increases DEX, Decreases STR and base damage     Repeating Thrust   Quick Step   Sword Dance   Double Slash       Heavy Ashes of War   Increases STR, Decreases all others     Kick   War Cry   Endure   Stamp Sweep   Cragblade   Wild Strikes       Lightning Ashes of War   Increases DEX and Lightning Damages, Decreases STR and base damage     Lightning Slam   Lightning Ram       Holy Ashes of War   Increases FTH and Holy Damage, Decreases Physical damage     Golden Vow   Sacred Blade   Golden Slam   Vow of the Indomitable   Prayerful Strike       Quality Ashes of War   Balances STR and DEX     Storm Stomp   Square Off   Determination   Charge Forth      






Most Ashes of War should be used to support the weapon you&#39;ve decided to wield alongside a certain build path. For example, those wielding a Strength weapon for their Confessor build should consider applying Heavy Ashes of War before others. Feel free to collect many Ashes from various NPCs around the Lands Between to have the right substance for any situation in Elden Ring. 



 Best Spirit Ashes for Confessor Builds 
          

  Spirit Ash   Amount of Followers   Description    Archer Ashes   3   A warrior wielding basic bows.    Skeletal Militiaman Ashes   2   Spear-wielding skeletons that attempt to respawn if killed.    Fanged Imp Ashes   2   A creature that throws pots filled with magic.    Wandering Noble Ashes   5   Zombie nobles that are armed with various gear.    Godrick Soldier Ashes   2   A shield vanguard and someone wielding a crossbow.    Greatshield Soldier Ashes   5   A soldier using heavy shields and ghostflames.    Ancestral Follower Ashes   1   An ancient warrior that fires a heavy war bow.    Banished Knight Oleg   1   A knight fighting with dual long swords.    Kiaden Sellsword   1   A powerful fighter with a curved cleaver.    Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet   1   Someone who heals you and deals Holy damage to enemies.

Omenkiller Rollo   1   A warrior dual-wielding heavy weapons.   






Once again, the right Spirit depends on how your character has progressed throughout your adventure. Omenkiller Rollo would be an excellent ally for those who dedicate their build to Faith and Mind stats for additional spellcasting in Elden Ring. On the other hand, Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet would be an excellent summon for anyone who prefers to play like a tank and risk-taking more damage from melee encounters.

The best Confessor build in Elden Ring depends entirely on your preferences, but only if you take advantage of the flexibility that makes the class strong to begin with.
