## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 shows relationships of all types, but not all of them are good. These are 10 of the most toxic relationships ranked bad to worst.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 shows a variety of relationships, and allows for Tav or the Origin characters to develop a romance with another character or two. Some of those relationships have elements that are entertaining to witness, such as Ascended Astarion, making them options that are chosen despite the unhealthiness of it. But toxic relationships in BG3 come in all forms, from romantic to family and even business partners.

 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.













 








 10  Ascended Astarion &amp; Tav 
Astarion&#39;s Ascension Changes The Relationship&#39;s Power Dynamic


 







The talented Neil Newbon gave Astarion life in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and this earned him a place as a fan-favorite character. Both non-Ascended and Ascended Astarion&#39;s romances begin the same way, but Ascended Astarion&#39;s attitude changes as a result of how Vampirism works in the Forgotten Realms. Any emotional attachments are twisted when somebody becomes a full Vampire, and love specifically turns into obsession. This obsession he has with Tav becomes clear. While he calls Tav his treasure and intends to keep them by his side, the dynamic they develop could be considered toxic. Or at the very least, unhealthy.





 9  Minthara &amp; Tav 
Romancing One Of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Villains
        

With Minthara being a villain and a Lolth-Sworn Drow, it&#39;s not surprising that a relationship with her isn&#39;t the healthiest. And if a relationship starts with one partner trying to kill the other after their first intimate night, that&#39;s a big red flag. However, recruiting Minthara and seeing how she changes when she isn&#39;t under the influence might be worth handling her cruel views as a follower of Lolth.





 8  Shar &amp; Selûne 
Twin Sister Goddesses &amp; Rivals


 







The relationship between Shar and Selûne is at the core of Shadowheart&#39;s story, which shows how unhealthy their relationship is that they involve their followers, willing to accept the death or torment that could come with using them. Shar is particularly toxic in this relationship, using her followers against Selûne and then throwing them away, as shown with her commanding Viconia to kill her former congregation. Selûne, on the other hand, is more forgiving; although it seems she doesn&#39;t directly interfere in mortal affairs, she accepted Shadowheart&#39;s return after her time as a Sharran depending on the choices made during her quests.





 7  Wyll &amp; Mizora 
Mizora Has All The Leverage In Their Relationship
        

Wyll and Mizora have a more transactional relationship, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s healthy. After renewing his pact to save his father, Wyll mentions that Mizora has held his feet to the fire twice, meaning that he felt forced into selling his soul due to necessity rather than desire. Considering there are multiple instances where Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 shows that dealing with devils is a bad idea, it makes sense that Wyll&#39;s relationship with Mizora isn&#39;t healthy. Although Mizora as a character tends to be either loved or hated, that means that her sass and attitude make her appearances at least entertaining.





 6  Gale &amp; Mystra 
Mystra Urges Gale To Sacrifice Himself
        

Gale fell in love with the goddess who&#39;s quite literally the embodiment of magic, Mystra. Then, he tries to ascend to godhood to impress her, and the result has Mystra more or less condemn him to death. All around, it&#39;s not a great relationship dynamic and could be seen as toxic, especially the part where Mystra wants Gale to use the bomb inside him to destroy the Absolute, and himself with it. If there was love between them once, it&#39;s clear that was no longer the case long before BG3 started.





 5  Orin &amp; The Dark Urge 
The Dark Urge Must Fight Their Family
        

With the Dark Urge as the main character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, there&#39;s a rivalry between them and Orin due to their familial relationships. Naturally, with Bhaal at the center of this family, the relationships are toxic and focused on killing the competition to become Bhaal&#39;s Chosen. This relationship culminates with a duel to the death, and that&#39;s not usually part of a healthy family bond.





 4  Ketheric &amp; Isobel 
Isobel Is Ketheric Thorm&#39;s Daughter
        

By the end of Act 2, it&#39;s revealed that Isobel&#39;s full name is Isobel Thorm, daughter of Ketheric Thorm. However, their relationship isn&#39;t healthy because Ketheric isn&#39;t the same man that Isobel knew as her father, not when he&#39;s a follower of the Absolute. Meanwhile, Ketheric refused to let his daughter rest in peace and gave himself up to follow the Absolute in exchange for Isobel to be resurrected. Add in the fact that Ketheric is tormenting and using his daughter&#39;s lover, Dame Aylin, to sustain his immortality and the situation is overall very toxic.





 3  Shadowheart &amp; Shar 
Shar Meddled With Shadowheart&#39;s Entire Life
        

Shadowheart&#39;s devotion to Shar is unwavering for at least two acts, and possibly into the third depending on the choices made in the Shadowfell. However, saving the Nightsong leads to a few realizations about how important Shadowheart is to Shar, and the reality is that she was just a tool used in an attempt to prove that darkness was stronger than the moonlight. Shar&#39;s practices and desire to prove that darkness would win led to Shadowheart&#39;s parents being held captive and tortured, Shadowheart&#39;s memories being erased, and her life put on an entirely different path than it would have been without the interference of Sharrans.





 2  Lae&#39;zel &amp; Vlaakith 
Lae&#39;zel Becomes Disillusioned With The Githyanki Lich Queen
        

Lae&#39;zel carries a blind devotion for Vlaakith. At least until she learns that Vlaakith wants to get rid of Orpheus, who&#39;s a threat to her position, and Lae&#39;zel learns how much of a traitor Vlaakith is to the Githyanki for the sake of power. This toxic relationship could be extended to any Githyanki who disagrees with or turns against Vlaakith. She stole power, and she&#39;s determined to keep a position that doesn&#39;t belong to her.





 1  Orin &amp; Gortash 
BG3&#39;s Most Toxic Relationship


 







Orin and Gortash have a relationship akin to business partners, working together as the Chosen of Bhaal and Bane, respectively. However, they have the worst toxic relationship in BG3 considering the one thing that&#39;s keeping them from killing each other is the desire of their gods. Gortash openly admits to the Dark Urge that he prefers them to Orin, finding her too erratic and uncontrolled. There&#39;s no love lost between them, and they both try to convince the party to kill the other and bring their Netherstone to continue using the Elder Brain and furthering their plans.
Relationships come in many forms, and while plenty of them can be summed up by the term &#34;it&#39;s complicated&#34; in BG3, there are quite a few that are both complicated and toxic, or at least unhealthy. And yet, in a virtual world, those relationships might have a draw that leads to the choices required to see or participate in them being taken. Whether the dynamic is love, or there&#39;s love in hating it, the presence of these relationships shows another way that complexity and diversity is used in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
