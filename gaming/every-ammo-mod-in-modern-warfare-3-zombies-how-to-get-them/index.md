## Literature Review

There are many different Ammo Mods you can find and craft in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies to shoot bullets with the best effects for killing the undead.





The only way to craft Ammo Mods is to find the exact Schematics of a certain type, but these blueprints are only earned as a random gift from Rift Rewards. You may also find the plans for a particular Mod in chests or caches found scattered throughout the Urzikstan map. Try to infiltrate Infested Strongholds and other dangerous areas for the best chance to uncover at least one kind of Schematic in Modern Warfare 3.
Another way to apply Ammo Mod effects is to drink the Elemental Pop flavor of Perk-a-Cola in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. Keep in mind that this only has a small chance to activate a random Ammo Mod ability. 

            
 
 MW3 Zombies: How to Unlock The Quick Revive Recipe 
One of the strongest Perk-a-Cola recipes you can unlock in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is the Quick Revive, which lets you recover an ally much faster.












 








 5  Brain Rot 
Friend and Foe
        

The Brain Rot Ammo Mod turns zombies into allies when struck by your bullets, making them turn on other enemies and giving you small windows of opportunity. This Mod is by far the trickiest to use, since you don&#39;t want to kill any target afflicted with this condition in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. While those under this effect may not survive for long, it can be a great way to cause a distraction that allows you to retreat.
Another part of Brain Rot is how zombies explode when the status completes, creating a small Area of Effect (AoE) burst that damages nearby foes. This could be a potent strategy when dealing with Mercenary Convoys in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, who have large groups of competent human enemies. Turning the tide of animated dead against Urzikstan scavengers may help you finish different missions on the map.





 4  Cryo Freeze 
Cold as the Dead


 







Elemental damage is a consistent trait tied to Ammo Mods, but Cryo Freeze in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies may be the best implementation of this effect. This Mod doesn&#39;t just apply Freeze damage to your shots, it also has a chance to slow zombies that you target. Enough bullets will even freeze an enemy completely, which happens to be a required objective in missions against Hellhound monsters you&#39;ll encounter.
Just like Brain Rot gives you an advantage in Modern Warfare 3, Cryo Freeze will help you manage the ridiculous number of zombies you or your squad might face. Weapons like SMGs, Assault Rifles, and Pistols are the best to use with this Mod since they spray more bullets than other weapons. You want to apply Cryo Freeze effects to as many zombies as possible, since it&#39;s always better to have undead frozen than attacking.





 3  Shatter Blast 
Explosive Personality
        

Probably the most straightforward Ammo Mod in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is Shatter Blast, which simply makes enemies explode when they get hit. The blast triggered randomly by this effect causes a much larger damage radius than anything seen by the Brain Rot mod. Zombies near an exploding target are typically knocked down, giving you or your squad the perfect chance to quickly pick off injured undead.
Shatter Blast is also a great Ammo Mod for taking out the armor that exists on extremely dangerous zombie types, letting you apply more damage to these undead when you remove their defenses. 

While there are many easy applications of Shatter Blast, keep in mind that allies can also be damaged by the explosions set off by the Ammo Mod. It&#39;s best to fire your weapon into larger crowds of zombies to trigger the effect, using precise shots rather than a hail of bullets. A Sniper Rifle may be able to use the blasts from the Mod to take out a whole army of zombies before they can even approach you in Modern Warfare 3.





 2  Napalm Burst 
Third Degree Burns


 







The Napalm Burst Ammo Mod sets enemies on fire every so often as you shoot different targets, causing them to lose health rapidly over time. Unfortunately, this fire does not spread to other targets, making this effect one of the weaker conditions compared to other Mods. The burning does last for a while in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies and will typically take out a majority of basic enemies without you ever needing to fire another shot.
Much like Cryo Freeze, Napalm Burst changes your bullets to an elemental damage type, with this particular Mod giving shots unsurprising Fire damage. 

If you end up with this Schematic before any other Ammo Mod, don&#39;t worry. You still have a chance to increase the Tier of this item to make it far more powerful. Those looking to conserve ammo will want to upgrade Napalm Burst to cause the burning effect to tear through more zombie health. This lets you take out enemies much faster across Urzikstan as you try to explore areas with higher threat levels in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies.





 1  Dead Wire 
Electric Thriller
        

By far the most versatile Ammo Mod in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is Dead Wire, which immediately gives you bullets with Electric-based elemental damage. Whenever the effect of this Mod activates, basic zombies are stunned for a brief amount of time as small arcs of lightning latch onto other nearby enemies. Similar to Cryo Freeze, Dead Wire also happens to slow down any undead afflicted by its effect.
The only factor about Dead Wire that may be lackluster is the damage applied to various foes. However, the utility of this Mod makes it useful on almost any weapon in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, without any of the risks that apply to other ammo types. When a zombie impacted by this electricity dies, it also releases a surge of energy that instantly causes a lot of damage to enemies standing nearby.
Once you get every Ammo Mod type in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, you or your squad will be able to implement new strategies during missions that take advantage of each bullet type&#39;s unique effect(s).
