# Why Baldur s Gate 3 Origin Character Levels Make No Sense


## SUMMARY 



  The Origin characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 should be higher levels based on their backstories and abilities before the game&#39;s events.   The in-game explanation for their low starting levels is that the mind flayer parasites or other factors caused their power downgrade.   Gale and Wyll&#39;s levels can be roughly determined, but it takes more guesswork to figure out the other Origins&#39; levels prior to the game.

## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Origin characters level up alongside the player, but them start at level one doesn&#39;t make sense considering their backstories.




Over the course of the party&#39;s adventures in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 the characters go from fresh-faced at level one to powerful adventurers at level 12. However, given the backstories of some of the companion and Origin characters that doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. From wizards powerful enough to catch Mystra&#39;s eye to 200-year-old vampires, some of the BG3 Origin characters should be a much higher level when first met.

The companion and Origin characters of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are there to provide support and context for the world as the threat of the Absolute is faced. Starting at level one, they will become more powerful as the party completes quests, explores new areas, and gains more experience points. But what level should the Origin characters of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 actually be?

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Origin Characters Should Be Higher Levels 
         

For fairly obvious gameplay reasons, all the Origin characters start at level one so that their skills can be customized for each playthrough. This is even explained away with an in-game reason for this, with characters mentioning that before their tadpole, they were more powerful. However, in terms of lore, they should all be much higher levels given their lives before the events of the game, and some should be higher levels than they reach by the end of Baldur’s Gate 3.






 Why The Origin Characters Start Out At Level One In BG3 
          

While the Origin characters start off Baldur’s Gate 3 at level one alongside the player character, they no doubt were much higher levels before. Reddit user baelrog began a discussion of what levels the characters should be canonically, with many others joining in with their opinions. The thread assesses each character in terms of their backstory and information gathered through speaking with them, and compares that to known Dungeons &amp; Dragons spells and lore to come up with some very logical and plausible answers.

The in-game reason for the Origin characters starting out at level one is addressed directly by Wyll. During a chat at camp, Wyll can be asked about how he came to be known as the Blade of Frontiers and some of his adventures. The warlock will directly state that he used to be much more powerful, claiming he could summon hell beasts and festering clouds to defeat his enemies.





 

Wyll seems to believe that it is the mind flayer parasites that he and the other Origin characters now carry which are the source of his downgrade. Meanwhile, Gale has another, more personal theory, and believes it is the orb in his chest that had taken much of his magical power. However, these in-game reasons are obvious attempts to explain away why powerful and sometimes well-known characters are now squishy level ones again.

If the Origin characters are looked at as real people who had lives before Baldur’s Gate 3, then it becomes clear that there is a discrepancy between their backstories and the abilities they have within the game. Karlach was Zariel’s top soldier, Shadowheart was sent on an important mission by her cloister, and Wyll had gathered enough of a reputation on the Sword Coast to be known as the Blade of Frontiers. These were clearly skilled, or at least competent, individuals who had abilities far greater than those seen when they are first met.






 Gale &amp; Wyll&#39;s Levels Prior To BG3 
          

So what levels should the Baldur’s Gate 3 Origin characters be, or more precisely, what level would they have been before the illithid tadpoles? To work this out, careful attention has to be paid to conversations with the characters as well as clues found throughout the game. Sometimes the clues take the form of particular DnD spells or abilities mentioned, and other times it requires a little more guess work based on NPCs encountered.

The most obvious two are Gale and Wyll, who both mention or make use of spells far higher than they have access to in BG3. Gale, for example, uses the sixth-level wizard spell contingency should he be killed, with a mirror image version of him appearing and talking the party through his resurrection. Wizards get access to sixth-level spells at level 11; however, Gale was probably a much higher level than that.




Gale indicates that his falling out with Mystra occurred when she wouldn&#39;t allow him access to greater spells, suggesting he had reached the maximum spell level of nine already. This would mean Gale was at least level 17 when he came into contact with the Netherese orb. This is further supported by a high-ranking wizard like Elminster considering Gale a peer and friend.

Meanwhile, Wyll mentions summoning hell beasts and festering clouds, which help pinpoint his warlock level. Wyll is probably talking about the spell stinking cloud, which is available to Fiend warlocks and is a third-level spell. Warlocks gain access to third-level spells at level five, but Wyll also mentions summoning beasts. There are a few spells to which Wyll could be referring, ranging from level three to six, putting Wyll prior to BG3 around levels five to 12.



 Other Origin Character&#39;s Prior Levels Are More Difficult To Determine 
          




The other BG3 Origin characters are a little harder to pin down; however, it is reasonable to assume that Karlach would be a similar level to Wyll. Wyll was sent after Karlach with the assumption made that he would be able to defeat her. Therefore, Karlach being at least close in level to Wyll is logical. Meanwhile, Lae’zel is still fairly young and eager to prove herself. While she has taken part in raids and battles, she has not yet earned a title, so placing her around levels five to seven would be a reasonable estimate.

Astarion has been a vampire for 200 years, using his skills to lure victims home for Cazador. It’s hard to believe after 200 years he would still be level one, and looking at the other vampire spawn provides the best clues for Astarion’s prior level. The other vampire spawn encountered, such as Dalyria, are level 11 when met in Act 3 of BG3. Their abilities differ from Astarion&#39;s, and he mentions that he was among the first of Cazador&#39;s vampire spawn. Therefore, it would be sensible to infer that Astarion was at minimum level 11, although he may have been higher at level 12 or 13.




Finally, Shadowheart, who was a member of the Sharran Cloister of Sombre Embrace in Baldur&#39;s Gate. Looking at the other Sharran that can be encountered there in Act Three, they range from level four novices and sentries to level seven Justiciar Crusaders and Fidelians. As Shadowheart mentions in BG3, her goal was to become a Dark Justiciar, so it can safely be assumed that she was under level seven.

However, as Shadowheart was sent on an important mission, she must have been seen as competent. She was sent to retrieve the Astral Prism alongside other higher ranking Sharran to prove herself to the Mother Superior. Taking in all the evidence, placing Shadowheart’s level prior to the events of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 at around level five or six would be rational.
