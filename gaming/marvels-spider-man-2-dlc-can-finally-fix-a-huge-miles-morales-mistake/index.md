# Marvels Spider-Man 2 DLC Can Finally Fix A Huge Miles Morales Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales missed an opportunity to expand its relatively short story with DLC.   Spider-Man 2 continues to relegate Miles, a consequence of Peter being so close to Harry, Venom&#39;s host.   With Peter stepping back from superhero duties at the end of Spider-Man 2, however, Miles is perfectly poised to get the attention he deserves in potential DLC.

## Literature Review

Insomniac&#39;s latest game, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, absolutely needs to redeem a notable absence from its predecessor, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.




The release of DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 could finally resolve a huge missed opportunity from Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The second game released in Insomniac&#39;s Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series, Miles Morales, was an outstanding title; however, the base game was short and it lacked any DLC. This was compounded in the most recent game, by the fact that Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, for the most part, comes across as a Peter Parker-orientated game, with Miles being relegated to the unenviable position of being the game&#39;s secondary protagonist - especially during the main story sections concerning Harry Osborn and the game&#39;s primary antagonist, the sentient alien Symbiote known as Venom.

While the first game in the series, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, received an expansive multi-chapter DLC, The City That Never Sleeps, the absence of any DLC for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales left a lot to be desired. With Peter seemingly stepping back from his Spider-Man duties at the end of the story of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, it could be a great opportunity to follow in the footsteps of its earliest predecessor and include a multi-chapter DLC, this time specifically focused on Miles Morales. It would certainly go some way towards making up for Miles&#39; own game&#39;s diminutive duration and lack of any DLC.

                  &#34;Something Never Experienced Before&#34;: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Review   Spider-Man 2 brings Peter Parker and Miles Morales together for what is one of the best PS5 exclusives yet – a triumph of gameplay and storytelling.

As the conclusion of the game sets up a sequel, it could be argued that the perfect DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 would actually be a significant departure from the story arcs of the base game. Although any future DLC for Spider-Man 2 is unlikely to completely shirk the web-swinging gameplay that&#39;s made the series so successful, it would be fantastic if Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 DLC were to noticeably differentiate itself from the base game&#39;s story. While the subject of the game&#39;s DLC could be any of a number of characters, including MJ, the best, most deserving, and most likely candidate is the story&#39;s second Spider-Man, Miles Morales.

                  The Perfect Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 DLC Is A Completely Different Game   There are many possibilities when it comes to a DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but the best one would completely change the game and story.    

Though Miles was the subject of his own game, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, this short, but enjoyable experience failed to satiate many fans&#39; cravings for Miles&#39; unique brand of Spider-Man action - a desire that was still not sated during Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. While Peter is the original, best-known, and most widely adored figure to don the mask, and therefore his prominence in the game makes sense, Miles has seemingly been positioned as the heir apparent to the role of New York City&#39;s primary resident super-hero. Consequently, his comparatively brief screen time and relative significance in the game&#39;s story could seriously hurt his legitimacy in the eyes of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man players.






 Miles Deserves A More Prominent Role In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC 
         

While Miles Morales is a prominent figure in some of the most emotional moments in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, this deeply relatable character is only occasionally a key part of a narratively significant event - most notably, his battle against Mister Negative, his battle against Symbiote-controlled Peter Parker, and as a member of the trio that take on Venom in the game&#39;s final boss fight. Outside these pretty rare notable sections, as well as a few less memorable ones, Miles is mostly relegated to carrying out insignificant, albeit entertaining, tasks for the distressed citizen of New York City, as well as the occasional stealth mission and family dinner.

Though he has notable sections in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, particularly during Peter&#39;s time under the influence of the Symbiote, Miles has seemingly been relegated to a position of less significance in this latest Insomniac Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man game. Peter has a more noticeable and emotive character arc, he is more personally involved with the host of the primary antagonist, and he gets the lion&#39;s share of the game&#39;s screen time. Despite this, the manifestation of Miles, as well as his story, in the game means that there is a nearly endless supply of possible directions Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s potential DLC could take if it were to mostly focus on Miles Morales.






 There Are Countless Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 DLC Possibilities 
          

There are a number of ways Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC could go; however, if Miles is the main protagonist, a few obvious choices begin to emerge. One particularly interesting option would concern the game&#39;s very final post-credit scene in which Miles, Hailey, and his mother, Rio, welcome Rio&#39;s new boyfriend, and his daughter, into their home. The daughter, Cindy Moon, is better known by fans of the franchise as Silk. In the comics, Silk has a similar skill set to Peter and Miles after also being bitten by a radioactive spider, and could theoretically be a core component in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2&#39;s DLC - perhaps teaming up with Miles to master her new skillset, or even as an adversary.

Additional possibilities hinted at in-game include the threats posed by a few of the Spider-Man franchise&#39;s most devilish and dangerous supervillains, most notably - Chameleon, Carnage, or even Norman Osborn as the infamous Green Goblin. While these are only a number of potential directions the game&#39;s DLC could take, Miles is an incredibly versatile character who would be well-suited to any number of options. The absence of any DLC for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales was quite disappointing; however, Insomniac has the perfect opportunity to redeem this with a Miles Morales-centered multi-chapter DLC for their latest game, Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2.
