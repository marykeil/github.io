## Literature Review

While many modern titles emphasize hardware-pushing visuals, some still some PC games for players who don&#39;t have a dedicated graphics card.




Getting into PC gaming can sometimes seem like a costly endeavor, but plenty of great games are playable without needing dedicated graphics cards or high-end equipment. Graphics cards or GPUs seem to be getting more costly as the years go on, with some top-tier cards on the market fetching upwards of $1,500 or more. That&#39;s a huge sum just to be able to play video games at the highest resolution and frame rate, and it&#39;s understandably a deal-breaker for many. However, getting into PC gaming doesn&#39;t have to break the bank.
Integrated graphics, rather than dedicated GPUs, utilize the computer&#39;s CPU or processor. While this technology has been frowned upon by hardcore PC gamers, in reality, many PC games don&#39;t necessarily need a dedicated graphics card to run. In fact, budget-friendly requirements can even be a blessing in disguise, as while they may not be known for the best graphics, many less graphically intense games include deep and interesting stories, compelling character development, or interesting gameplay mechanics.
            
 
 10 Console Exclusive Games That Deserve A PC Port 
Out of all the games that need a PC port, which titles need it the most? Redditors have weighed in with a number of games as suggestions.












 








 15  Terraria (2011) 
Developer: Re-Logic


 







  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   2GHZ    Memory   2.5GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   200MB    Video   128MB Video Memory    
Terraria is a game available via Steam that only requires 200MB of hard drive space. Praised for its complex gameplay, Terraria can be played single-player or online with friends and is akin to 2D Minecraft with its own unique mechanics and aesthetics. In the game, players mine deep into the ground to discover new treasures and resources to build interesting equipment, weapons, and structures. Best of all, the game can run on various low-end systems, including mobile devices, because of its simple pixel graphics.
            
 
 Terraria Sells Over 35 Million Copies Across All Platforms 
Terarria developer Re-Logic announces the game has sold more than 35 million copies across all platforms, also becoming Steam&#39;s highest-rated game.








 14  DOOM (1993) 
Developer: id Software
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Intel Core 2 Duo E8200    Memory   4GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   1GB    Video   Nvidia GT 630/AMD HD 7750    
DOOM is one of the most well-optimized games of all time, even if it&#39;s not really the first FPS game; as such, id Software&#39;s seminal 1993 first-person shooter DOOM was made with a large install base in mind. Far ahead of the popularization of discrete graphics cards, DOOM could run on even relatively basic systems back in the day, and its file size under 2 MB meant that memory space wasn&#39;t as much of an issue as it was with other DOS titles.
An enhanced version with slightly higher requirements was released in 2019 and is now playable on the Epic Games Launcher and Steam. 

Today, any computer that can run Windows can run DOOM. In fact, the Steam store page lists Windows XP/Vista compatibility as the bare minimum requirement. Considering that DOOM is even playable inside another DOOM copy, Valve&#39;s DRM services are likely more taxing on a PC than id&#39;s hit game.





 13  Darkest Dungeon (2016) 
Developer: Red Hook Studios
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   2.5 GHz Dual core    Memory   2GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   2GB    Video   Open GL 3.2&#43; Compliant    
Darkest Dungeon initially debuted in 2015 into Early Access as a fairly barebones horror roguelike affair, but it eventually blossomed into a complex title. Darkest Dungeon requires party management and strategy as a tale of desperation and depravity sees the players wager long odds in a grizzly war against a Lovecraftian horror. Though the game isn&#39;t for everyone, it was certainly made to run on just about every PC. With the only real stipulation being OpenGL compliance, this title can run on pretty much anything.

 12  Stardew Valley (2016) 
Developer: Concerned Ape


 







  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   2.5 GHZ    Memory   2GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   500MB    Video   256MB Video Memory    
Stardew Valley accomplishes what other farming simulation games can&#39;t in a 2.5D pixel world. Praised for its fun and relaxing gameplay, the cozy farming simulator runs light on the system resources while including a huge amount of content within the title. In Stardew Valley, characters can grow crops, raise farm animals, or craft different equipment while managing relationships with people in the Valley. With both single-player, split-screen, and online co-op, Stardew Valley can be enjoyed alone or with a group of friends.

 11  Minecraft (2011) 
Developer: Mojang Studios
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Intel Core i3-4150 or Intel Celeron N4100    Memory   2GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   2GB    Video   Integrated: Intel HD Graphics 4400    
Renowned for its almost impossibly vast, randomly generated worlds, Minecraft seems like it would be fairly taxing on most PCs despite its simplistic aesthetic. While that might be true for those who enjoy installing mods that heavily alter the game&#39;s visuals, Minecraft&#39;s Java edition can run on practically anything.

In Minecraft 1.20, players can use seeds to generate worlds with rich veins of Diamond Ore, giving them access to rare Diamonds for crafting gear.



The Minecraft alpha first became publicly available in 2009, and while installing the best Minecraft mods in 2023 might prove too demanding for lower-end systems, its base requirements are still reflective of its age. Performance can certainly be improved with the now relatively inexpensive eighth-gen gaming consoles, but just about anyone with a working laptop can still give Minecraft a go.





 10  Undertale (2015) 
Developer: tobyfox
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   2GHz    Memory   2GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   200MB    Video   128MB    
Those looking for less violence in their games should turn to Undertale, the quaint but memorable pixel-art RPG where, many of the times, it&#39;s best to have a meaningful conversation over a deadly battle. Wholly unique in its approach to storytelling, Undertale is an often overlooked game with very low system requirements but a witty and compelling story that will have people coming back to complete the campaign.





 9  Dead Cells (2018) 
Developer: Motion Twin


 








  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Intel i5&#43;    Memory   2GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   500MB    Video   Nvidia 450 GTS/Radeon HD5750    
Those looking for a high-intensity side-scrolling action game need look no further than Dead Cells, the 2D metroidvania-inspired action platformer. With satisfying, responsive controls and gameplay mechanics, a veritable treasure trove of weapons and powerups, and violent and bloody combat, Dead Cells harkens back to iconic side-scrollers of the past, like Castlevania. In fact, the recent Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania DLC is a testament to its inspiration and is just one of the many DLCs that add variety and replayability to the title.





 8  Hades (2020) 
Developer: Supergiant Games
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Dual Core 2.5 GHz    Memory   4GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   1GB    Video   1GB VRAM/DirectX 10&#43; support    
As one of the best games of 2020, Hades stands out above many other roguelike titles with tight, fast-paced action and engaging characters. Fortunately for those looking to play PC games without a graphics card, it also has very low system requirements. Even the recommended requirements only ask for 2GB VRAM and Direct X10&#43; support.
On a system without a graphics card and without a lot of system RAM to spare, Hades might see some slowdown when the screen fills up with lots of enemies and effects. In general, though, the game should be smooth sailing on most computers. Plus, with Hades 2 on the way, there&#39;s no better time to hop into the roguelike inspired by Greek mythology.





 7  Portal (2007) 
Developer: Valve
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   1.7 GHz Processor    Memory   512MB RAM    Hard Disk Space   1GB    Video   DirectX 8.1 level Graphics Card    
These days, it&#39;s rather easy for underpowered computers to handle Valve&#39;s Source 2 engine, and that&#39;s good news for Portal fans. Not only is it easy on the hardware, but it&#39;s one of the coolest and most inventive FPS puzzle games ever made.
Portal&#39;s gameplay is simple, consisting of a gun that can create two types of dimensional portals that allow players to navigate a series of puzzle-themed rooms. Players should avoid the official Portal ray-tracing upgrade if they&#39;re looking for games that don&#39;t need a graphics card to run, but it&#39;s otherwise a game that tests the gray matter without testing the machine it&#39;s running on.





 6  Among Us (2018) 
Developer: Innersloth
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   INTEL i3-4330    Memory   1GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   250MB    Video   INTEL HD Graphics 4600    
Among Us is one multiplayer PvPvE game that doesn&#39;t require an incredibly expensive GPU. The well-known title has remarkably low system requirements, with Intel HD Graphics 4600 being required to play, making the fact that 4-15 players can play together more impressive. In Among Us, people must complete tasks on a spaceship with one or more of the players disguised as a killer. This creates a claustrophobic and paranoid game that can surprisingly result in many laughs.





 5  Vampire Survivors (2022) 
Developer: Poncle


 







  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   x64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support    Memory   1GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   600MB    Video   DX11, DX12 capable    
Vampire Surivors is an indie game created by a sole developer, poncle. An action roguelike, the high-paced retro action of the game is reminiscent of the 2.5D action games on the NES or SEGA, but with modern gameplay controls and skill trees. In Vampire Survivors, players must struggle to survive against hordes of undead creatures and disturbing beasts imagined by the game&#39;s creator. Like other roguelikes, survival ensures a randomized set of upgrades, where the goal is to synergize the most powerful combinations.





 4  Valorant (2020) 
Developer: Riot Games
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Intel Core 2 Duo E8400    Memory   4GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   30GB    Video   Intel HD 4000/Radeon R5 200    
Valorant is comparatively new to the FPS arena, having been released in June 2020. Yet, Riot Game&#39;s title can still run on an Intel HD 4000 or AMD R5 200 architecture, all without the need for a dedicated GPU to handle the visual workload. This particular game is dependent more on the CPU rather than any graphics hardware, which is a benefit for those without an expensive graphics card.
This gives players a lot of wiggle room to adjust graphics preferences and hit their desired sweet spots when it comes to clarity versus frame rate. The game itself looks brilliant and sharp on any settings, which is a testament to how integrated graphics can power a deceptively simple FPS title.

 3  Hollow Knight (2017) 
Developer: Team Cherry


 







  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Intel Core 2 Duo E5200    Memory   4GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   9GB    Video   GeForce 9800GTX&#43; (1GB)    
Hollow Knight is a game with low system requirements that still manages to have beautiful and, at times, haunting visuals. A classic 2D sidescroller, the single-player game mixes the difficulty of a souls-like game in a 2D realm with a wonderfully rendered cell-shaded aesthetic. With snappy, responsive controls and plenty of unique gameplay mechanics, the inventive tale takes people on a dark and twisted adventure crafted by Team Cherry.





 2  BattleBit Remastered (2023) 
Developers: SgtOkiDoki, Vilaskis, TheLiquidHorse
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   Intel Core i5-2310    Memory   6 GB RAM    Hard Disk Space   2GB    Video   Geforce GTS 450    
Those who want to play a solid first-person shooter but feel hampered by inferior hardware should definitely check out BattleBit Remastered. With up to 254-player lobbies, a host of driveable vehicles, and destructible environments, the FPS indie title does more than a lot of AAA shooters manage to pull off with massive budgets. Best of all, it&#39;s made to run on older and lower-end hardware.





 1  Team Fortress 2 (2007) 
Developer: Valve
        

  Minimum Hardware Requirements    Processor   1.7 GHz Processor or better    Memory   512MB RAM    Hard Disk Space   15GB    Video   DirectX 9 Compatible    
Originally released in 2007, Team Fortress 2 has to be one of the most celebrated multiplayer games of all time. A seminal hero shooter that helped to inspire later titles like Overwatch and Valorant, Team Fortress 2 is a challenging FPS that asks players to become acutely familiar with the intricacies of its various classes.
While success sometimes hinges on teamwork and communication, PC performance will almost never be a factor. Team Fortress 2 has maintained high player counts over the years, showcasing its easily approachable fun. Able to run without a dedicated GPU, players can enjoy Team Fortress 2 on PC without an expensive graphics card.
