## Literature Review

It can be a drag to explore the Wild West on the wrong steed, but thankfully, getting the fastest horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 solves this problem.





The fastest breed of horse doesn&#39;t appear until you have finished Chapter 6 of the main story, making it a creature you won&#39;t see until very late into the game&#39;s content. This makes acquiring this mare one of the best things to do after beating RDR2, along with other rare mounts. Adding this steed to your stable will take a good amount of money, so make sure to stock up on some cash beforehand.

 How To Find the Fastest Horse in RDR2 
The fastest horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 is the Rose Gray Bay Arabian, which can be purchased from the Blackwater Stable for $1,250. This steed costs more than any other stallion in the game and is the only one in the class of &#34;Superior.&#34; The Arabian destroys the competition with base stats of 7 Stamina, 6 Speed, and 6 Acceleration, scores that far surpass the other mares Arthur can buy.



Some other breeds, including the Missouri Fox Trotter and Brindle Thoroughbred, may have faster base Speed than the Arabian. Still, the lack of a good Acceleration score makes them slightly weaker horses by comparison.

While the Arabian is not one of the horses you can get for free, the mare makes up for your investment with incredible potential. According to YouTube creator Astrosive, this horse only gets better when you bond with it and use the right equipment. The boosts to already ridiculous stats for the Arabian can be exciting, even if you have to wait until the Epilogue to reach this stallion.




Those who take the time to farm money to buy the fastest horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 will find a steed that thunders across the map with astonishing speed, making fast travel an afterthought as you pass through gorgeous scenery.
