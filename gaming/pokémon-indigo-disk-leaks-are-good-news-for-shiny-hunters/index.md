## Literature Review

A new set of leaks regarding Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC may be good news for players who consider themselves Shiny hunters.




There are new leaks about the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that indicate good news for players who consider themselves Shiny hunters. These collectors often go through the trouble of spending hundreds of hours in-game to collect the rare Shiny versions of Pokémon, which are represented by an alternate color palette – even if some Shiny Pokémon, like Gengar, only present some very subtle differences in coloration. Shiny hunting in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has improved in comparison to the rest of the series due to the presence of mass outbreaks and how they work, which makes encountering Shinies a whole lot easier.




Although Shiny hunting has been facilitated in Gen 9 games, there are still some Pokémon that are impossible to catch natively in their alternative-colored forms. These creatures are considered to be Shiny locked, and it is common for this lock to be placed upon Legendaries and Mythicals. When Gen 8’s Sword and Shield first came out, it was impossible to obtain Shiny Zacian and Shiny Zamazenta, for instance – their Shiny versions were later distributed, lifting the Shiny lock, even if they cannot be obtained like that through the campaign. Now, new Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC leaks indicate that more Shiny locks will be removed.

                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC: Everything Leaks Say About Dokutaro (Peach Mythical)   There have been multiple leaks and rumors about a new Mythical Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC called Dokutaro, which allegedly resembles a peach.   


 Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC May Lift Some Shiny Legendary Locks 
          




Recently, there have been a few Indigo Disk leaks about Legendary Pokémon that highlighted 25 returning creatures being added to the Gen 9 games. While the news of the datamined Legendary returns, first mentioned by Makio &amp; JRoses on X, can be very appealing in its own merit, its seems like some Shiny locks will be lifted. According to Centro Leaks on X, which reposted Makio &amp; JRoses’ post, none of the 25 returning Legendaries will be Shiny locked, which means three of the creatures will be making their Shiny debut in the franchise, even if their Shiny versions were coded into Pokémon HOME they were previously featured in.



 3 Shiny Legendaries From Sword &amp; Shield May Debut In Pokémon’s Indigo Disk DLC 
          

Out of all the 25 listed Legendaries that are allegedly making their return in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, three of them are bound to lose their Shiny lock, if the information posted by Centro Leaks is accurate. Gen 8’s Kubfu, Glastrier, and Spectrier are currently Shiny locked but are expected to make their Shiny debuts in the upcoming expansion for the Gen 9 games. Kubfu was first introduced in Gen 8, through the Isle of Armor DLC for Pokémon Sword and Shield, while Glastrier and Spectrier were added to the duo of games via the Crown Tundra expansion.






If Kubfu is capable of evolving in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, then there is a chance that Urshifu’s Shiny forms will also be made available in Gen 9 games. For reference, Urshifu has two distinct forms: Single Strike Style and Rapid Strike Style.




The Shiny versions of the three aforementioned Pokémon exist officially, as they are coded into Pokémon HOME. As seen on Bulbapedia, Kubfu’s Shiny version does not have much of a difference in its coloration, with the exception being the color of the Fighting-type creature’s snout. The Shiny version of the first of the King’s Steeds, Glastrier, is also very subtly different from its regular form, with the darker color of the ice being the most apparent change, as shown by its sprite on Bulbapedia. As registered by Bulbapedia, the Shiny version of Spectrier is the most different, with a wine-colored hue taking over the violet.

However, these Shiny Legendaries cannot currently be obtained through any legal methods in Sword and Shield or Scarlet and Violet. The only way of getting them right now is by hacking the games, which is not allowed. If the leaks about the Indigo Disk DLC’s inclusion of 25 returning Legendaries are true, and if they are, in fact, not Shiny locked, this will be fantastic news for Shiny hunters. Of course, how these Legendaries will be obtainable is still a mystery, which means it could be difficult to encounter their Shiny forms. Nevertheless, simply having Shiny Kubfu, Shiny Glastrier, and Shiny Spectrier made available through official means is welcome.






As is the case with any leaks regarding Pokémon, the information regarding the return of 25 Legendaries in the Indigo Disk DLC and the fact that they are not Shiny locked should be taken with a grain of salt. The information may be incorrect or subject to change ahead of the content’s release.






 Paldea Legendaries Are Still Shiny Locked In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
         

Even with the allegedly leaked debut of the Shiny versions of Kubfu, Glastrier, Spectrier, and perhaps Urshifu in the Indigo Disk DLC, there are still a few Pokémon that are Shiny locked in Scarlet and Violet, including the Legendaries from the region of Paldea. Koraidon and Miraidon, the respective mascots for each version of the Gen 9 games, are impossible to obtain in their Shiny forms through legal methods, as well as the four members of the Treasures of Ruin scattered across the island. The Loyal Three and Ogerpon from the Teal Mask DLC are also Shiny locked for now.




Outside of Gen 9, there are also a few other Legendary and Mythical Pokémon that are temporarily Shiny locked, with no expectations as to when they will be made available in-game or handed out via a distribution event. This list of creatures includes Pokémon like Arceus, Calyrex, Enamorus, Marshadow, Zarude, and others. It is possible that they will appear at some point as event Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC, but so far that cannot be confirmed. Regardless, there is still a long path before every Pokémon in the series has its Shiny version made officially obtainable by Nintendo.

Nevertheless, the news that three or maybe even four Legendaries are having their Shiny locks lifted is great for regular players and Shiny hunters alike. Shiny versions of Legendaries that are only obtainable through core games tend to serve currency for rare trades in Pokémon HOME, as well as ostentatious exhibitions. Hopefully, the Indigo Disk DLC leaks about the 25 returning Legendary Pokémon and their lack of a Shiny lock are true, so that players can be introduced to a few new Shiny creatures in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
