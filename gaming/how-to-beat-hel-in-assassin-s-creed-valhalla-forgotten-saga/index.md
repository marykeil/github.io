## Literature Review

The new Forgotten Saga expansion to Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla introduces the powerful Queen of Niflheim, Hel, as a boss you can learn to beat.





You start the Forgotten Saga in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla differently from the base game since the expansion is actually a roguelite instead of the standard gameplay you might expect. Every time Odin dies, he starts back at his camp with randomized armor and weapons. Runs retain Niflheim skill tree abilities and certain favors, but you still need a strong build to reach Hel eventually.

 How To Defeat Hel in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla Forgotten Saga 
          

The key strategies for defeating Hel are to unlock fire-related abilities, exploit the boss&#39; weakness, and take advantage of dodging to build up Odin&#39;s Adrenaline. The toughest bosses in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla still have clear vulnerabilities that you can learn through trial and error. Make sure you have a few basic skills equipped for Odin or runes that boost your fire elemental damage.

There are two phases to the boss fight with Hel, with the first seeing her and Fenrir attacking Odin relentlessly. Hel attacks at close range most of the time with heavy attacks that can deal much damage if you get hit. With Fenrir attacking up close as well, the best plan here is to dodge often to build special attacks throughout the first phase that you target Hel more often than Fenrir. 






One of the best abilities for this boss fight is Brush with Death, a skill that slows down time whenever Odin successfully dodges an attack, which you likely will try to do often.




Fenrir cannot be killed in the first phase since Hel will resurrect him if the large wolf&#39;s health ever reaches a critical point. Use medium-range weapons and arrows to ignore Fenrir and constantly pressure Hel instead until the Queen eventually falls to the ground. The second phase begins with Fenrir&#39;s defeat as Hel shows signs of damage, and the arena starts glowing red in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla.

Hel focuses on using special attacks during the second phase as much as possible, which makes it difficult to approach the boss from far away. You need to chase Hel down or use fire arrows to deal extra damage from far away at this point in the fight. Keep the pressure up, and you will eventually knock the Queen of Niflheim off her throne once again to win the battle.




Those who beat Hel in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla should try to take her on again in additional runs to unlock every achievement and view hidden secrets that still remain in the Forgotten Saga DLC.
