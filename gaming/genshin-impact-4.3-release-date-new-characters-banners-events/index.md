## Literature Review

HoYoverse has confirmed the release of Genshin Impact 4.3, and shared a series of information on the pieces of content arriving with the patch.




Most of the upcoming gameplay additions in Genshin Impact 4.3 have been revealed by developer HoYoverse in the respective version livestream. Before each update, which tends to occur every six weeks, a livestream is held to present everything new that is coming in the next patch. Some of the main highlights tend to be new playable characters, story quests, limited-time events, and banner reruns. Lately, the game has also been focusing on a lot of system optimizations that improve players’ experience. A few leaks, such as those about the process of claiming rewards getting easier in Genshin Impact, even turned out to be true and were confirmed during the livestream.




Aside from several of the quality-of-life announcements, the special program also confirmed Navia’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.3, as well as Chevreuse’s. Both as new characters debuting in the upcoming patch. They do not come alone, however, as there will be a few anticipated banner reruns occurring during the next update. Version 4.3 will not lean in too heavily into story quests, but will instead focus on a series of special events, many of which will grant an abundant amount of rewards, that range from a new and F2P (free-to-play) weapon to leveling materials and, of course, Primogems.

                  Genshin Impact Natlan Release Date Predictions (Based On Past Updates)   Although HoYoverse has not revealed the release date for Natlan in Genshin Impact, it is possible to predict exactly when it will arrive.   


 Genshin Impact 4.3 - Release Date 
          




Although it was not highlighted too extensively during the livestream, which was held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch, HoYoverse has confirmed that Version 4.3 arrives on December 20. This means that the current patch is going to continue following the six-week schedule for Genshin Impact updates and that there have not been any delays for the upcoming content. At this point, it is very unlikely that the patch will get postponed in any way, as content delays in the game tend to happen even before an official release date is revealed. The last time content has been delayed was with Version 2.8.



Recently, Genshin Impact 4.2’s livestream was postponed, but that did not affect the arrival of the content itself in due time.






 Genshin Impact 4.3 - Character Banners (&amp; New Characters) 
         




As was previously mentioned, Navia and Chevreuse are the two new playable characters confirmed to arrive with Genshin Impact 4.3. Navia is a 5-star Geo character that uses a claymore in battle. Her role is a mix between a DPS and a sub-DPS unit. Navia’s specialty is triggering Crystallize reactions with her Elemental Skill, in which she pulls out her umbrella which also works as a rifle, and shoots at an enemy. This also imbues her regular strikes with Geo and increases her power. By triggering Crystallize reactions, Navia can generate and then pick up Crystal Shrapnel charges, which allow her to fire special rounds from her weapon.

Navia’s Elemental Burst sees her command a barrage of AoE Geo DMG. This can also trigger Crystallize, which in turn feeds her with more power. Chevreuse, on the other hand, is a 4-star Pyro unit that equips a polearm. She will mainly be a support character in Genshin Impact 4.3, healing active team members after firing her musket with her Elemental Skill, while also decreasing enemies’ Pyro and Electro RES when in a team comp with only Pyro and Electro units. Navia will be featured in Phase 1 banners, along with Ayaka Kamisato. The Phase 1 weapons banner will also debut Verdict, Navia’s signature 5-star claymore, which resembles an axe.






Phase 1 weapons banner will also feature the 5-star sword Mistsplitter Reforged, Ayaka’s signature weapon.




Phase 2 banners in Genshin Impact 4.3 will be composed of reruns of Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya. Chevreuse will make her debut in the Phase 2 banners, having an increased drop rate during the period. As a 4-star hero, she will be incorporated into the standard loot pool in the gacha system. The fact that Chevreuse is paired up with an Electro and a Pyro unit, respectively, makes perfect sense for her gameplay kit, which works around Overloaded Reactions. The weapons banner in Phase 2 will feature the 5-star polearm Grasscutter’s Light and the 5-star bow Thundering Pulse, Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya’s signature weapons, respectively.

Aside from the new playable characters and the rerunning heroes that will be featured, a new character will also debut in the upcoming patch, even if not in their playable form. The long-leaked Chiori, from the region of Inazuma, will be making her first in-game appearance. She will be accompanying certain Inazuman characters on their expedition to Fontaine as part of the flagship event for Genshin Impact 4.3. It is uncertain when she will become playable, but Chiori’s in-game debut is good news, as it indicates that the development of her character model is finally or at least nearly complete.






 Genshin Impact 4.3 - Story Updates &amp; World Updates 
          

Story content will not be too heavily present in Version 4.3, as the main set of Archon Quests in Fontaine has come to a conclusion in Version 4.2. Although the main focus will be on events during this update, there will be a new story quest related to Navia. The mission will revolve around aiding the new playable 5-star character as she tries to help rebuild the village of Poisson. The Genshin Impact 4.3 livestream highlighted that while constructions are easily done, players will also need to mend the fissures left by those that were lost to the Primordial Seawater in the events prior.

The upcoming patch will not extend the region of Fontaine with any new areas. However, the next patch will add two new sets of Artifacts for players to farm. Song of Days Past and Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods are the two sets that will be added, though the location of the Domain in which they will be obtainable is still unknown.






 Genshin Impact 4.3 - Events, Rewards, &amp; System Updates 
          

There will be a lot of events in Version 4.3. The flagship event will revolve around the Fontinalia Festival, the most important celebration in the Nation of Justice – it is comparable to Liyue’s Lantern Rite or Mondstadt’s Windblume Festival. During the period, players will aid a host of characters from Inazuma, who travel to Fontaine to film a movie. It is during this event that Chiori should appear. While Primogems and other resources will be part of the rewards, the main highlight is the Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword, a F2P 4-star claymore in Genshin Impact. Its Ascension material, Super-Duper Invincible Shingin Sparkly Magic Crystal, will also be obtainable.

There will be several game modes in the Roses and Muskets event, such as the leaked sniper mode in Genshin Impact 4.3, as well as a battle mode with special modifiers, another in which players need to push mecha balls into goals, and a photography mode. Aside from this, there will be another installment of the beetle battle event held by Arataki Itto, an event that grants a new Mini Seelie pet that can go underwater, a combat challenge, Liben’s Box O’ Marvels, and new additions to the Genius Invokation TCG mode in Genshin Impact.




There will also be noteworthy system optimizations in the upcoming patch. One is an overhaul to the Artifacts system, which will now present recommendations for characters, add an auto-lock feature so that players can protect their best drops according to their own specifications, improve sorting, and a bigger cap for enhancement materials when leveling Artifacts. Enhancement screens will also be optimized for characters, with a new auto-add function, and minor improvements to weapon enhancements in Genshin Impact as well.

With the system optimizations, Domains teleport players back to the key when rechallenging them instead of throwing them all the way back in the room. Additionally, the quest flow will be improved, so that players can skip a few steps and automatically trigger Archon Quests in the Chasm. HoYoverse also announced a feature that allows players to claim all expedition rewards with a single click, and redispatch characters with another. The Serenitea Pot will also gain a Fontanian-style layout. Among new content and minor tweaks, there is a lot to look out for in Genshin Impact 4.3.
