## Literature Review

Stellar Tera Shards are a rare but important item in The Indigo Disk DLC, but you won&#39;t be able to farm them effectively until late in the game.





Terastallization is a major mechanic in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, as it changes the type of the affected Pokémon. It is the main mechanic behind the ever-popular Tera Raid Battles and adds a new strategic edge to Pokémon battles as a whole. By adjusting your Pokémon&#39;s Tera-type to Stellar, you&#39;ll have an incredible advantage in these Tera Raid Battles.





 Best Farming Practices For Stellar Tera Shards 
          

Typically, you can farm Tera Shards by fighting Terastallized Pokémon of the corresponding Tera-type. For example, if you want Water Tera Shards, you can get some by fighting a Pokémon with a Water Tera-type. Tera Raids are also good ways to find Terastallized Pokémon. However, wild Stellar-type Terastallized Pokémon are not available at the start of The Indigo Disk. There are also no Stellar-type Tera Raid Dens for easy farming, unlike the other 18 types.

While wild Stellar-type Pokémon aren&#39;t available early on in the storyline for The Indigo Disk, you can eventually spawn these encounters throughout the four biomes around Blueberry Academy. In order to do this, you must complete the full story of The Indigo Disk, credits and all. This involves beating the Elite Four of Blueberry Academy, each situated within one of the four biomes. From there, you&#39;ll face the Blueberry League Club champion and return to Area Zero for Terapagos.




                  How To Beat The BB League Elite Four (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC)   The Elite Four trainers of the Blueberry League (BB) are hard opponents to beat in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, unless you&#39;re prepared.   

Once all that is done, you can find wild Stellar Tera-type Pokémon wandering through the biomes. You can catch these Pokémon to instantly have a Stellar Tera-type Pokémon on your team, but if you defeat these Pokémon, you can collect Stellar Tera Shards. This is the only way to effectively farm Stellar Tera Shards in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.



If your main goal is to have a Stellar-type Pokémon, it is easier to catch a wild Terastallized Pokémon than collect enough shards to change the type of one of your stronger Pokémon. However, you will then have to build that new Pokémon to fill your team.






 How To Use Stellar Tera Shards 
          




If you want to change your Pokémon&#39;s Tera-type to Stellar, you&#39;ll need to collect 50 Stellar Tera Shards from wild Stellar-type Terastallized Pokémon around Blueberry Academy. Once you have enough shards, head back to Paldea and make your way to Medali Town, home to the Normal Gym and the Treasure Eatery.

When you visit the Treasure Eatery, the chef will offer to make a dish that can change your Pokémon&#39;s Tera-type to that of the dish. Give him the 50 Stellar Tera Shards and he&#39;ll make a dish for your Pokémon.

                  Which Way You Should Fight The Elite Four In Pokémon Indigo Disk (&amp; Why)   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC has its own set of Elite Four challenges. Players can battle them in any order, but which one is best?   

By feeding this dish to your chosen Pokémon, when they Terastallize, they will be of the Stellar Tera-type and dominate against other Terastallized Pokémon. With that, you are a master of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s new Tera-type.
