## Literature Review

A new set of allegedly leaked details about The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are hinting at the most broken creature in the series.




A few new leaks about the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet seem to be hinting at one of the most broken Pokémon in the series. The Indigo Disk is the second expansion of The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero DLC pack and will conclude the story initiated by the Teal Mask, which took place in Kitakami. Instead of sending players on a field trip to a faraway land, however, Trainers will partake in an exchange program with Blueberry Academy, the sister school to Paldea’s Naranja and Uva Academies, respectively. This location is set in the middle of the ocean and is officially part of the Unova region.




This is one of the reasons that the rumors about Pokémon Gen 5 remakes are being in the spotlight right now. Even though very little about the upcoming DLC was officially shown by Nintendo – perhaps in an attempt to keep surprises at bay – a lot of information about the content has been uncovered. There have been numerous Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC leaks, including new forms for Koraidon and Miraidon, a brand new Mythical creature that may be connected to the campaign, and even the removal of some Shiny locks on Legendary creatures. Now, there are rumors about a Pokémon that may be a lot more powerful than anticipated.

                  Pokémon Leaks: Every Legendary Pokémon Coming To Indigo Disk DLC   According to an alleged new leak, the list of returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet has been datamined.   


 Terapagos May Be Indigo Disk’s Most Broken Pokémon 
          




According to the popular Pokémon leaker known as Riddler Khu on X, the Legendary mascot for the Indigo Disk DLC, called Terapagos, will have a “defensive” Ability. The exact nature of what this means is currently unknown. However, Khu did reply to a user who mentioned the possibility of it ignoring Mold Breaker, saying that Terapagos is “immune to Weezing’s gas.” This means that the Ability Neutralizing Gas, which suppresses the effects of other Abilities in the game, does not affect the Legendary. While it is uncertain what Terapagos’ Ability does exactly, there are rumors based on the leak that hint at the franchise’s most broken Pokémon.



Neutralizing Gas does not work on a series of other Pokémon Abilities, including Multitype, Zen Mode, Stance Change, Power Construct, Schooling, RKS System, Shields Down, Battle Bond, Comatose, Disguise, Gulp Missile, Ice Face, As One, and Neutralizing Gas itself, as registered by Bulbapedia.






 Rumors Suggest Terapagos Will Neutralize Super Effective Moves In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
         




Because of Terapagos’ possible connection to all the Types in the series, including a new Type leaked in Pokémon Indigo Disk, there are players speculating that the Legendary will naturally negate any kind of Super Effective hit against it. In a post made by FluffyPets on Reddit, which discussed Riddler Khu’s original post on X, user Ninjaskfan imagines Terapagos being incapable of receiving Super Effective damage while also boasting higher defensive stats in the game. In response, user OddSifr complements the idea, mentioning that all of Terapagos’ natural Resistances could also be maintained. They also refer to the theory that the 19th Type will turn all damage into neutral.

The discussion debunks the rumors that Terapagos would have an alignment to all 18 standard Types simultaneously – which would mean it would still take Super Effective damage from Rock-type moves – but instead boast this new Type that resists Super Effective hits from all sources. As mentioned by user Trap_Pixie, it will be up to the players to find out its weakness in Pokémon Indigo Disk. Of course, this is not necessarily true for Terapagos all the time. The Legendary already has two confirmed forms and there are leaks indicating there will be a third and final form, a transformation that will also be done by Koraidon and Miraidon.




If the ability to suppress Super Effective hits against itself is, in fact, true, there is a chance that this will be related to a special form rather than being constantly present. In another post made by Riddler Khu on X, they cite that Terapagos’ Ability is “dope” while sharing artwork depicting Terapagos as Pokémon as large as the planet. This could be an indication that Terapagos’ broken defensive capabilities occur when it is transformed into its third mode. While negating Super Effective moves is one of the strongest theories about the leaks regarding Terapagos, there is yet another source of speculation that seems aligned with Khu’s mentions of defense.

                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC: Everything Leaks Say About Dokutaro (Peach Mythical)   There have been multiple leaks and rumors about a new Mythical Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC called Dokutaro, which allegedly resembles a peach.   



 Other Theories Mention A Defensive Form Of Protean For Terapagos In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
          




Another theory pointed out by user Hobbitfeet22 on the Reddit post is that Terapagos may be able to change Types when it is attacked in order to resist that specific attack’s Type. In a reply, Thefirefreezesme mentions that it could work as a reverse form of Protean. The Ability, which started off as Kecleon’s Signature Ability but is now available with Froakie and Sprigatito’s Evolutionary lines in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, allows the Pokémon to change their Type based on the first move they use in a battle. With a “reverse Protean,” the creature could change Types to become resistant to that which is attacking it.

Considering Terapagos’ affinity to all Types, that could be enough to make changing Types for defensive purposes during battles work. This may be a less broken Ability than simply neutralizing all incoming Super Effective hits, but it would also be a powerful mechanic for Terapagos to wield in the Indigo Disk DLC. There is also speculation among players on Reddit that Terapagos’ defensive Ability would instead see the creature resist Tera-boosted attacks, which could also be true considering the creature’s alleged connection to the Terastal phenomenon. However, it seems somewhat counter-intuitive and unlikely, as it would go against the very principle of a core mechanic in Gen 9.




For now, the information regarding exactly how Terapagos works is unknown and broken down to speculation based on Khu’s mentions of it having a “defensive” Ability. If the most popular rumors about it being resistant to all Super Effective moves are true, it may indeed end up becoming one of the most broken Pokémon in the entire series. Given that Ogerpon’s boss battle in The Teal Mask was challenging and went through four distinct forms before being over, it is possible that the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will take it up a notch and present a major battle with Terapagos and its three forms.
