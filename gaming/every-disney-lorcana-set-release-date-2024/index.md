## Literature Review

Here&#39;s every new set and other items coming to the Disney Lorcana TCG over the next 12 months and when players can expect them to be available.




Disney Lorcana is already positioned to have a busy year in 2024, with many planned releases for its upcoming sets that will further the story and introduce new cards to the TCG, as well as a specially designed introductory set. Ravensburger recently announced a roadmap of when people can expect to see additional sets debut for the game, with a new one arriving roughly every three months. This is continuing an ongoing theme of quarterly releases after the initial The First Chapter in August 2023 and Rise of the Floodborn launching a few months later in November.




Since its initial launch in 2023, Disney&#39;s trading card game (TCG) has struggled to keep up with demand due to supply issues. This problem appears to be resolved, and now the cards are remaining well stocked at most major retailers as well as local game stores. With the availability at better levels, eager players are excited to see what comes next for the Illumineers, and Ravensburger&#39;s newly revealed 2024 Disney Lorcana roadmap is here to answer that question.

                  Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands - Release Date, Pricing, &amp; New Cards   Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands is the third set for the TCG, arriving early next year with new location cards and fan-favorite characters.   


 Disney Lorcana Will Release Four Sets Per Year 
The First Two Sets Were Launched In 2023
         

Disney&#39;s TCG has stated since the very beginning that it will be launching new expansions to the game four times per year for the foreseeable future, which is similar to how Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon TCG have been doing their content updates. The first two sets, Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter and Rise of the Floodborn, were released in 2023 and have served to introduce the story of Lorcana to the world.




The first two expansions laid the foundation for the story of what happened when the Great Illuminary saw disaster strike and lost the lore of the Inklands. They served to look at why players, known as Illumineers, were adventuring for lore and explained how more than one of the same characters could be in play at the same time through the concept of glimmers. In the upcoming Into the Inklands, the game mechanics will expand just as the story does, with the introduction of Location cards to Disney Lorcana.

                  What Are Floodborn, Dreamborn, &amp; Storyborn Cards In Disney Lorcana?   Disney Lorcana’s second set is Rise of the Floodborn, so here is a breakdown of the differences between Floodborn, Dreamborn, and Storyborn.   



 Disney Lorcana&#39;s 2024 Roadmap Of Releases 
New Sets Arriving Every Few Months
          

Disney Lorcana sets each release on two separate dates, giving a priority release to local hobby shops and friendly local game stores (FLGS) as well as the Disney Parks stores. Then, a couple of weeks after that initial launch, they become available online and everywhere else that the game is sold, including major retailers such as Target and Walmart.




Here are the dates provided for upcoming releases of expansion sets for Disney Lorcana throughout 2024:

 Set Name  Local Game Stores And Disney Parks Release Date  Mass Retailers and shopDisney Release Date   Into The Inklands  February 23, 2024  March 8, 2024   TBA  May 17, 2024  May 31, 2024   TBA  August 9, 2024  August 23, 2024   TBA  November 15, 2024  November 29, 2024   





Although there are no announced names yet for the May, August, and November sets, being able to have locked-down dates for those expansions can help with budgeting and planning.




These anticipated sets will include a continuation of the expanding story of Lorcana and, of course, many new card reveals. New game mechanics may be added, such as the new Location cards coming to February&#39;s Into the Inklands set and possibly other surprises along the way. In addition to the above expansions, a special game set called Disney Lorcana TCG Gateway is also set to be released in August.






 Disney Lorcana TCG Gateway Coming In August 
A Special Introductory Game For New Players
          

Disney Lorcana TCG Gateway will be a stand-alone game product that serves to teach people the basics of a TCG experience and how the cards in Lorcana work together through a gradual process. It will be released on August 9, 2024, and provides everything that two people will need to play the game, including a special game board and character standees not seen in traditional Lorcana. Each player will start the game with a pre-selected 30-card deck, and over the course of the learn-to-play experience, they will slowly add another 30 to create a standard 60-card deck.

By the end of the game, players will have a better understanding of many of the typical rules of TCGs, particularly Disney Lorcana, and each will have constructed a deck of 60 cards that can be used to play Lorcana with others in a more traditional way.

 Disney Lorcana: Into The Inklands Releases In February 
The Third Disney Lorcana Set Kicks Off 2024
          

Disney Lorcana: Into the Inklands will be released in February 2024, and besides simply bringing in beautiful new cards to the game, it also adds a game mechanic from Location cards. These Locations will allow glimmers to be assigned to them to get extra buffs and lore, and they can be challenged and attacked by opponents just as a character card could be. Cards in this set include characters from 101 Dalmatians, DuckTales, Treasure Planet, and more.

Despite its shaky start due to initial unavailability, Disney Lorcana is picking up steam now that people can get the cards, and the roadmap for 2024 will continue to keep the game fresh as the story evolves. The upcoming Disney Lorcana TCG Gateway will also help to teach many who may be new to the concept of TCGs how to play, especially given how many people may be drawn to the game simply from the familiar Disney characters. Disney Lorcana is set to have a good year in 2024, and it is exciting to see what the future will hold.
