## Literature Review

Making unique characters for D&amp;D can be a challenge since it&#39;s easy to fall back on clichés. Some creative thinking can help break the mold.




Making an interesting Dungeons &amp; Dragons character is all part of the fun of playing, but devising a good concept can sometimes be one of the most challenging aspects. Ideally, a character should feel like a natural part of the world, but creating a stock fantasy trope isn&#39;t the most interesting path. It’s far too easy to fall into the trap of using the same clichés when rolling a new character, resulting in a party that feels more like a template than an interesting group of adventurers. Any character can be roleplayed in an interesting way, but having a unique spin up front makes this task a lot easier.




Everyone has seen or read about the lone wolf ranger character or the lovable and Robin Hood-like rogue. A flirtatious bard or an old, cranky wizard are so commonplace that they are practically parodies at this point. While these ideas are not necessarily bad, they have been done so many times that it is hard to find a new interpretation of them. Whether trying to fit a character into a specific race and class or starting from scratch at the idea phase, there&#39;s no shortage of exciting approaches to DnD characters to solve the conundrum of novel character creation.

 Play D&amp;D As A Pirate With A Twist 
          

A wide-eyed former pirate who didn’t know any better could be a fun character idea in Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Raised as a pirate from being very young, this character has only ever known a life of travel and raiding. Perhaps they were taken during one of the raids and adopted by the pirates, or maybe they are the child of a high-ranking pirate or even the Pirate King or Queen. It could be amusing to play with the idea of what Dungeons &amp; Dragons pirate characters are usually like and turn that on its head by having the character be quite innocent, especially if the rest of the party isn&#39;t.




Bringing a naive pirate character to life can be done by showing a fascination in the little things, being friendly to NPCs, and not fully understanding that stealing is wrong while still taking everything not nailed down. Over time spent with the rest of the party, they could eventually become a better and more selfless person. This character idea would work well for almost any race, as pirates are not restricted to one particular species. As for classes, rogues, fighters, barbarians, and bards would be the most obvious choices. However, players could also use other classes to put a further spin on the pirate cliché.



 Servant Turned Sorcerer D&amp;D Character Idea 
          

A darker character idea could be that of a servant who discovers that they have magical abilities. Like the pirate, the DnD character&#39;s backstory can be adapted to have been either born into servitude or found themselves as servants later in life. The emergence of their magic immediately made this character a target, as a lot of people in power suddenly wanted access to them. This character could have been used as a tool to do the bidding of others before managing to finally escape.




It would be nice to take a shy or detached character and have them open up more as their faith in the party grows. Their personality would be paranoid, and they would be slow to trust people. However, once another player or NPC has earned that trust, this character would do anything for them. This concept would work with most races, but for obvious reasons, would have to choose a powerful DnD spellcaster class or subclass. A sorcerer would be an obvious choice, but druid or bard could work equally well. Wizard could be used for an extra twist that that character gained their magic by &#34;borrowing&#34; their master&#39;s books.



 Twisting Dark Ideas Into Something Else For D&amp;D Characters 
          

Taking a darker idea and turning it into something fun can be a great way to create a unique character. For example, a necromancer, assassin, or bandit can be turned into a cheerful and friendly party member for an interesting spin on familiar tropes. This character could have an incredibly well-adjusted background for a DnD character, with a healthy and alive family and no mortal enemies. Tragic backstories are almost comically commonplace among DnD parties, so this could be a refreshing alternative to the usual sob story.




The fun comes from the roleplay where a person with a traditionally dark or evil profession or subclass just so happens to be really happy and positive all the time. The character could still be evil-aligned while remaining the hero; it would just be their personality at odds with what they do. A further twist could be to add a curse or spell which has made them super cheerful — or even some aspect of memory loss that has made them retain their skills and not their personality — allowing for a personal quest to end the curse and return to their usual sinister self.



 Playing A Deceptive Character Who Isn&#39;t Clever In D&amp;D 
          

Some of the most interesting DnD character ideas can come from building characters that don&#39;t seem very optimal to play, although it&#39;s important to avoid constantly sabotaging the party when doing so. One interesting angle is making an evil character more interested in subterfuge than the murderhobo lifestyle, but failing to give them much in the way of intelligence. Schemers in DnD are typically good at what they do, so having a character who&#39;s always interested in guiding the party down dark paths but incompetent when it comes to doing so is a nice change of pace.






When playing a character that has the potential to undermine the party&#39;s efficacy, it&#39;s important to draw a line at seriously endangering the lives of other party members without express consent.




Most parties are generally likely to effectively counter the worst damage that a character might do, as their inefficacy would make them easy to outweigh in argument or outwit in action. Anyone who actually wants to determine the strategy for the party would be better off not handicapping themselves in that way. Those purely focused on roleplay, however, could get a lot out of the idea, and the chaos that it can cause on the occasion that something works out might pay bigger dividends than taking the more basic murderhobo route.



 Playing As A Secret Goblin Is A Quirky D&amp;D Character Idea 
         




Characters who have a secret they have to keep from the rest of the party are challenging but rewarding to play. A goblin posing as another race, perhaps a gnome, halfling, or even a very short dwarf, is one interesting way to bring this idea to life. However, no one can know they are a goblin, as goblins are traditionally seen as evil in DnD, and this character could face hostility if discovered. Roleplaying this character with traditional goblin traits like quite skittish or quick to anger could be fun, but the opposite would also be interesting, further distancing the character from the canonical origin of goblins in DnD.

This fun DnD character&#39;s backstory could be a goblin who left his tribe, with players able to choose from a few different reasons for leaving. Perhaps they left because they felt a calling to a noble cause; the character could have discovered they had magic and were shunned by the other goblins; or perhaps they were captured by adventurers and made part of the party before leaving to make their own way in the world. As they learn to trust the party, the character could choose to reveal their true identity or simply wait until the other party members find them out.






 Using Uncertain Origins For D&amp;D Characters 
          

Similar to the secretive goblin, another interesting avenue is roleplaying a character who truly believes they are a different race than what they really are. This character could be a dwarf who thinks they are an elf or a human who believes they are a goliath. Perhaps they are a genasi who looks human and only uncovers their true heritage later, or a kobold who simply thinks they are a tiny dragonborn. Perhaps this character was raised by people of another race, or they are under the influence of a spell. Whatever the reason, they honestly believe that, despite all evidence to the contrary, they are a different playable DnD race.

This could be played for laughs initially before switching into an almost existential crisis for the character as they grapple with who they really are. Coming to terms with identity is a great roleplaying focus for any DnD character, so there&#39;s plenty of mileage to get out of this particular concept. It&#39;s also an interesting way to explore cultural and racial elements of the DnD world and break them down in meaningful ways to show just how complex individual identity can be.






 One Shot Characters Are An Excuse To Go Wild 
          

Some character ideas work better for one-shots than full campaigns, allowing players to be a little sillier than would make sense for an extended period. A fun character idea for a one-shot would be to make an NPC-type character instead of an adventurer with a complete personality. This character would use generic dialogue to engage with the other players and the world, offering up helpful game tips similar to loading screen text or even glitching out. This would obviously depend on the tone of the one shot being run and would have to be cleared with the DM beforehand, but having an NPC join the party would be hilarious.

Coming up with new and creative character ideas comes more easily to some than others. Taking inspiration from sources like film and television is a perfectly valid technique, as with a few tweaks, even the most modern characters can be adapted into fantasy settings. At the end of the day, there&#39;s no wrong way to build a DnD character as long as the character is played with the enjoyment of the entire party in mind. Dungeons &amp; Dragons character ideas can sometimes be hard to come by, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of ways to do something unique without having to spend hours thinking of ideas.
