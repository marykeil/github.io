## Literature Review

According to new leaks about the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, a unique and unused type combination will finally make its debut.




New leaks regarding the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet seem to indicate that the content will feature a groundbreaking new type combination, never before seen in the series. Although the franchise has been around for over 27 years, there are still a few combinations of types that have not been added to the games. Rock- and Ghost-type Pokémon, for instance, have not yet been developed, nor have Ice- and Poison-type creatures. Currently, nine type combinations are registered as unused in the Pokémon series altogether, but that number could be changing for the better very soon.




There are several Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC leaks being shared ahead of the expansion’s release later in December. The Indigo Disk is the second part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack, and a direct sequel to the events that took place in Kitakami with The Teal Mask. Unlike the first expansion, however, players will be sent over to Blueberry Academy, which is confirmed to be located in the region of Unova – one of the official details that further drives speculation around the reports of Gen 5 Pokémon game remakes. Among the leaks, there are reports that an unused type combination is finally being made official.

                  Pokémon Leaks: Every Legendary Pokémon Coming To Indigo Disk DLC   According to an alleged new leak, the list of returning Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet has been datamined.   


 New Dipplin Evolution In Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC May Hold A Unique Type Combination 
          




In addition to the leaks of a new type in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, there is also some speculation about the first ever Dragon- and Bug-type Pokémon in the series. In an enigmatic post made by the popular Pokémon leaker known as Riddler Khu on X, they use a meme image that depicts Japanese artist Pikotaro in his PPAP (Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen) music video holding a Hydreigon and a Volcarona in each hand. In the picture, he then merges the two Pokémon to form an apple. This may be a reference to Dipplin’s secret evolution in Pokémon Indigo Disk and its typing, which may be new to the franchise.



Dipplin’s evolution has not been confirmed officially, but there is in-game evidence that hints toward it, in addition to leaks that mention it.






 What The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Leaks May Actually Mean 
         




The post made by Riddler Khu lived up to their riddle-fueled reputation and was shrouded in mystery. Most of the comments in the post seem to indicate that the general understanding gathered from the image is that Dipplin’s new evolution will be a dual Dragon- and Bug-type Pokémon – a result of Hydreigon’s own Dragon-type, which Dipplin already has, as well as Volcarona’s Bug-type, which would be something new since Dipplin would have to discard its Grass-type. However, the post may not be referencing a new and groundbreaking type combination in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and instead be mentioning its design.

While unverified, there are several rumors about Dipplin’s new evolution having multiple heads instead of a single one. Because of these alleged leaks, there is some expectation that Dipplin’s evolution will be designed similarly to a hydra, a mythological three-headed serpent-like creature. This could be the real reason why Riddler Khu chose Hydreigon. Instead of making a reference that it would keep its Dragon-type, Dipplin’s evolution could have multiple heads. Following this train of thought, however, Volcarona’s presence in the post about the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC leak would also be referring to the creature’s design instead of its typing.




If a part of Volcarona’s design is used to feed the looks of Dipplin’s evolution, then Riddler Khu’s post may be suggesting that the new leaked Pokémon will either have large wings or a massive body. Regardless, the triple heads of Hydreigon and the winged form of Volcarona could compose how Dipplin’s evolution is designed. It seems like the apple will be retained, which could mean the Pokémon’s heads spawn from inside the fruit, with wings to help it fly. Until leaks get more concrete or the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC is released, the truth about Dipplin’s secret evolution will remain a secret.



If the rumored evolution is true, this will be the first third form in Applin’s evolutionary line – Flapple, Appleton, and Dipplin do not currently evolve into anything else.






 What A Dragon- &amp; Bug-Type Pokémon Would Be Weak Against 
          




If Riddler Khu’s post was in fact not a reference to the design of Dipplin’s evolution, but its speculated Dragon- and Bug-type build, this will be a new combination in the series. Although it has not occurred before, it is not particularly special – the combination has five weaknesses and is resistant to five types, much like many other type combinations in the game. Provided the rumored new 19th type does not interfere with the current typing mechanics, a Dragon- and Bug-type Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet would take 2x Super Effective hits from Flying-, Rock-, Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type moves.

In direct opposition, this dual Dragon- and Bug-type version of Dipplin’s evolution would take halved damage from Fighting-, Ground-, Water-, and Electric-type moves, and a quarter of the damage from Grass-type moves. This typing would take regular damage from all the eight remaining types in the series so far: Normal-, Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Steel-, Fire-, Psychic-, and Dark-types. It is unknown if Dipplin’s evolution will be of such a typing, but if it is, then this is the general type effectiveness that it will have during Pokémon battles.




                  Indigo Disk DLC Leaks May Suggest Most Broken Pokémon Ever   A new set of allegedly leaked details about The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are hinting at the most broken creature in the series.   

This alleged new typing would also give Dipplin’s evolution a few advantages in combat. One of the most notable ones would be superiority over Grass-type creatures. Not only would it boast a huge resistance to Grass-type moves, but it would also be able to land Super Effective moves against most Pokémon of that type, since Grass-type is weak against Bug-type attacks. Depending on the Grass-type Pokémon’s build, Bug-type would not be Super Effective, but this would be the general rule of thumb. This is particularly good since battles are said to be core to the experience in Pokémon Indigo Disk.



This was reported by a few previews of the expansion, such as the one written by Joe Merrick on Serebii.







Although most leaks seem accurate, they should always be taken with a grain of salt. The same can be said about rumors. These bits of information, speculative or not, could be incorrect or subject to change ahead of launch. Regardless, it seems like there is a lot of content inbound with the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and the rumored typing of Dipplin’s leaked evolution may as well be groundbreaking in the franchise.
