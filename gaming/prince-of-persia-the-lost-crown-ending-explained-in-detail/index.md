## Literature Review

The newest Prince of Persia tells a new story for the franchise, including an ending that leaves the door open for more sequels to follow after.




Starring a new cast of characters, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown tells an all-new story, with an ending that leaves the game open to further sequels. The first major entry in the Prince of Persia franchise since the 2010 release of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, The Lost Crown takes the form of an action-heavy metroidvania with a narrative centered around protagonist Sargon&#39;s quest to rescue the kidnapped Prince Ghassan from the old city of Mount Qaf, which is where the game mainly takes place. While the story is mostly straightforwardly told, there are a few significant twists.




Similarly to some of the previous entries in the Prince of Persia series, The Lost Crown&#39;s story has little relation to the stories of other games in the franchise, instead opting for a narrative that&#39;s largely self-contained, with a new cast of original characters. For the most part, the game centers around the Immortals - a group of seven powerful warriors, including the central protagonist, Sargon, who are tasked with rescuing the kidnapped Prince Ghassan from the cursed city of Mount Qaf. Complicating their quest, Mount Qaf is a dangerous location full of monsters and other threats.

                  Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Review: &#34;An Underwhelming Story Redeemed By Riveting Combat&#34;   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great new addition to the Metroidvania subgenre that offers players unique combat and a good time.   


 The Plot Of Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown 
         




After a short introduction in the city of Persepolis, which involves the Immortals fending off an invasion and defeating The Lost Crown&#39;s first boss, General Uvishka, the story of The Lost Crown kicks off with the kidnapping of the prince, Ghassan, by Anahita, formerly a trusted ally of the crown and the Immortals. Sargon and the Immortals pursue Anahita to Mount Qaf, under the assumption that she&#39;s planning to use the prince to gain the power of a bird-like deity known as the Simurgh. Once they arrive, however, they discover that time flows strangely at Mount Qaf, which causes some complications.



The strange flow of time around Mount Qaf causes several problems - the men sent ahead of the Immortals have been dead for years despite having only been sent the night before, and spans of time that Sargon experiences as hours are days for some others.




After fighting through Mount Qaf, Sargon manages to confront Anahita, leading to The Lost Crown&#39;s first major plot twist - as Sargon prepares to face Anahita, the leader of the Immortals, Vahram, shows up as well, suddenly killing Prince Ghassan to usurp the crown and become the king of Persia. After Anahita and Sargon are defeated by Vahram, Sargon discovers that Vahram has lied to the other Immortals, telling them that Sargon is a traitor and the one who killed Ghassan. While two Immortals, Neith and Artaban, still believe in Sargon, the others are turned against him.




At the same time, a mysterious old man, Alkara, leads Sargon to deal with the snake god Azhdaha, who guides Sargon towards finding four Celestial Guardians to give him the chance to go back in time and save Prince Ghassan. While finding the Guardians, Sargon is forced to confront and kill two of the other Immortals, Menolias and Orod, while also befriending a younger version of Vahram and gaining more power through the discarded feathers of the Simurgh.

Finding the four Guardians grants Sargon the chance to go back in time to the moment where Vahram killed Ghassan and stop it from happening, driving Vahram away with his new powers, although Anahita gives up her life to save Sargon from an attack. At the end of the fight, it&#39;s revealed that Vahram is the son of the former king, Darius, and that they both were betrayed and killed by the queen, Thomyris, in a bid for the throne - although Vahram survived the attack. Vahram escapes, forcing Sargon to chase after him, leading to the game&#39;s final confrontation.

 How The Lost Crown&#39;s Story Ends 
          

After fighting through more of Mount Qaf, including a battle against a partially resurrected King Darius, Sargon confronts Vahram for a final time at a temple where the Simurgh&#39;s heart resides. Vahram offers Sargon to give up the powers he has attained at Mount Qaf and join him, but Sargon refuses, and Vahram absorbs the heart of the Simurgh and destroys the world, aiming to recreate it to suit his own ideals. In the void that remains after, Sargon receives encouragement from the Simurgh, and goes to face Vahram again, aiming to save him from his own twisted desires.




After a lengthy fight with Vahram, who has become a winged, god-like being, Sargon eventually prevails, defeating Vahram and managing to convince him to let go of the Simurgh&#39;s powers. Vahram, seeing the error of his ways, ends up sacrificing himself, using his sword to cut the platform that he and Sargon are standing on and using his remaining power to restore the world and the power of the Simurgh, although his body dissolves in the process. After the final battle, the ending of the game takes place back in Persepolis where it started.

Sargon and Ghassan arrive in the throne room and stand before Queen Thomyris, where Ghassan lays down his crown, forfeiting his title out of disgust for his mother&#39;s actions. Thomyris praises Sargon for rescuing the prince and restoring the power of the Simurgh, but dismisses the deaths of the other Immortals as a small sacrifice. Sargon, likewise disgusted with the queen&#39;s actions, reveals to the crowd in the throne room the truth of King Darius&#39;s murder, leaving the queen to deal with the aftermath.




                  How To Get Every Time Power In Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has six time powers that alter how Sargon can travel across the battlefield and the city of Mount Qaf on his quest.   

Outside, Sargon has a moment of retrospection at a small pool, where a bird lands next to him. In the reflection of the water, Sargon sees Alkara, implied to have been the Simurgh all along, once again encouraging him to set off and follow his own path. After a moment, the bird flies off, and the next scene shows Sargon leaving Persepolis on horseback. Before he leaves, the two remaining Immortals, Artaban and Neith, see him off with the younger version of Vahram in tow, promising to take care of the young prince.

The Lost Crown ends with Sargon departing Persepolis for an unknown destination. While this ending stands on its own as a potential end to Sargon&#39;s journey, with no particular hinting at or baiting for a sequel, it notably leaves the door open for the story to continue. Whether the game receives sequels is still up in the air, but if it proves successful, the game that follows Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown could easily be a continuation of Sargon&#39;s journey.
