## Literature Review

After Below Deck Mediterranean&#39;s Jessika Asai sees Luka Brunton flirting with Natalya Scudder, she decides to have fun by kissing someone else.




The relationship drama never seems to end on Below Deck Mediterranean, and this time, Jessika Asai decided to put herself first by kissing castmate Max Salvador after having a season-long romance with Luka Brunton. During Below Deck Med season 8, Jessika, a member of the interior crew, developed a &#34;boatmance&#34; with fellow castmate Luka, Bosun of the deck crew. However, the two did not seem to be on the same page over what would happen to their relationship once the season ended. Jessika was hoping their relationship would develop into something long-lasting, while Luka had no plans of making it serious.




At the end of the most recent episode of Below Deck Med season 8, the show offered a glimpse into what will take place during the season finale. According to Us Weekly, former crewmate Natalya Scudder is seen returning to join the crew on their last night out and resuming her flirtatious relationship with Luka. The clip also shows Jessika watching the situation unfold in front of her, and she goes on to say, “Why do you want me to stay in your hotel room for the next two nights?&#34; When she becomes aware of Luka sending flirty texts, she adds, “He’s playing games. If they can, why can’t I?”

Jessika, after hearing Luka say, &#34;I got backups. Hundred percent,&#34; decides that she will have some fun of her own. Jessika goes on to kiss Max in front of the person Luka had had a flirtationship with earlier in the season, Lily Davison. Jessika then proceeds to tell Lily, “He’s a good kisser. I’m just saying.&#34; It is no wonder that the drama and stress are plentiful on Below Deck Med, with tensions in the crew cabins growing with every charter.





 

It is no secret that Luka has had his hands full dealing with multiple relationships at once, including his &#34;boatmance&#34; with Jessika. At the beginning of Below Deck Med season 8, Luka had initially hit it off with an interior crew member, Natalya, who ended up leaving the boat after only a few episodes. After Natalya left, Luka took his flirty relationship with Jessika to the next level, though he thought it was clear that he did not want anything serious. “I never said to Jess that I wanted a relationship. So there’s no strings,” Luka said in an episode that aired in January.

During the time he spent developing a fling with Jessika, Luka was also still texting Natalya while she was away. On top of texting Natalya while having a fling with Jessika, Captain Sandy Yawn also called out the fact that he was caught texting another Below Deck star, Katie Flood. However, Luka said that he knew Katie because she had dated one of his friends previously, but she was just a good friend. “I’ve known Katie for, like, four years. She used to date one of my friends, and I know that she’s worked with Sandy in the past,” Luka stated in a December 2023 episode of Below Deck Med.

Now Luka is raising questions among the Below Deck Med cast about his many relationships and where he stands with each woman. At the end of the day, Luka did not end up being in a long-term relationship with either Jessika, Natalya, or anyone else in the Below Deck franchise. In a recent update, Luka stated that he has rekindled a relationship with a former girlfriend, whom he had been with beforehand. Luka hit it off with a number of different women, but he ultimately left single. Even though Below Deck Med season 8 might be winding down, the drama between the crewmates is still going strong.




Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
