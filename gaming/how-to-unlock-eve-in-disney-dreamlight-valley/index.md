## Literature Review

The futuristic friend EVE from Disney&#39;s WALL-E has made its way to Disney Dreamlight Valley and is easy to unlock for players eager to play with her.





The new expansion pack will lead you to find EVE after you have unlocked Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Throughout the storyline, you will discover new skills, areas, and friends and watch the heartfelt reunion of the cute robotic couple, WALL-E and EVE. However, before embarking on this journey, purchase the A Rift in Time pack and update the game. The main character who guides the player through this expansion is Jafar, who plays a significant role in the player&#39;s friendship with EVE.




                  10 Coolest New Additions In Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s A Rift In Time Expansion   Disney Dreamlight Valleyâ€™s new expansion pass A Rift In Time brings a whole new land that doubles the size of the game with animals, story, and more.   


 &#34;The Metal Flying Nuisance&#34; 
          

Jafar will help you find EVE instead of being against them as a Disney villain in Disney Dreamlight Valley. He needs help, so he will upgrade your pickaxe, allowing players to break copper rocks, which is a new cool addition. You will then be tasked with getting the Royal Hourglass from a quest called &#34;The Metal Flying Nuisance,&#34; which leads to interacting with EVE. He will then give directions to search her house, where you will have to find a memory in the trash left around. 

This will lead to recovering a robot costume in Ancient&#39;s Landing, where the player will use the copper-breaking pickaxe. If you have difficulty finding this, reference the Hidden Area in Ancient&#39;s Landing from GosuNoob&#39;s video below. Break the rocks, open the chests, and return to EVE with your new costume. She will then start to trust the player more.





 



 The Best Fish Forever Meal

  Robot Fish   Sea Snail   Cumin   Celery  



All of the above ingredients an be found at The Docks and Goofy&#39;s Stall.




Consider collecting more ingredients that can be used in the best recipes to sell for Star Coins. EVE will now consider you to be a friend, and her friendship level can be increased. You will have successfully unlocked EVE&#39;s friendship quests, which can eventually let you invite EVE as a villager in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
