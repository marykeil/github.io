# Disney Dreamlight Valley Finally Has Multiplayer, But There Are Some Issues


## SUMMARY 



  Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s multiplayer feature, Valley Visits, is still in its early stages and lacks significant gameplay options.   Players must unlock Vanellope and obtain a Valley Visit Station to invite friends to their Valley.   Crossplay is supported for most platforms, except for PlayStation. Multiplayer activities are limited, but players can buy items, change outfits, pick flowers, take photos, drop and pick up items, and collect Pixel Shards.

## Literature Review

Multiplayer has been a feature that many have looked forward to having in Disney Dreamlight Valley, but in its current state, it isn’t very useful.




Disney Dreamlight Valley has added a new multiplayer feature alongside its official launch, but in its current state, there isn&#39;t much that players can do when multiplayer is active. Still, there is a lot to be said for the joy of being able to show off a decorated valley and home and enjoy playing the cozy game alongside friends and family. The new Valley Visits mechanic is still being worked on, so while many things about its current state are disappointing, they will hopefully be improved upon and corrected in upcoming updates.




Multiplayer in Disney Dreamlight Valley is called Valley Visits and was introduced as part of the free content update to the base game that occurred at the game&#39;s full release. It does not require the purchase of the expansion DLC, but players will have to have gotten far enough in the story of the game to unlock Vanellope. Once unlocked, up to four people can connect over an online connection to enjoy spending time together in one Valley at the same time. Once there, they can explore and show off their outfits or just run around together.

 Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Multiplayer Begins With A Valley Visit Station 
All Players Must Have Vanellope Past Level 2
          




Before players can even think about inviting their friends to their game, or of traveling to visit a friend, they must have a KL-1200 Valley Visit Station placed somewhere outside in their Valley. This colorful teleportation machine is obtained from Vanellope after her Level 2 quest has been completed and will then be found inside the player&#39;s furniture inventory. This Valley Visit Station is part of a free update to the base game and does not require purchase of the paid expansion.



 Disney Dreamlight Valley&#39;s Crossplay Support Doesn&#39;t Work On All Platforms 
PlayStation Is Not Supported
          

Players on PC, Apple Arcade, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox (including Game Pass) will be able to enjoy cross-platform multiplayer experiences. Unfortunately, crossplay is not supported for the PS4 or PS5 versions of Disney Dreamlight Valley. PlayStation users can still visit other PlayStation players, as long as they have an active PlayStation Plus subscription.






Subscriptions such as Nintendo Switch Online or Xbox Game Pass Core may be required to access online play through the platform used.






 What Players Can Do During Valley Visits In Dreamlight Valley 
Multiplayer Is Very Limited, For Now
         

There is no way to open a Valley for strangers to visit, but only invited players who have been given a secret six-digit code gain access. Once all the players have joined, the host can enjoy showing off their decorating style and giving everyone a tour of their home and personalized Valley, which could be particularly fun for those who have spent a lot of time creatively landscaping their world. Here is the list of everything that currently can be done during a Valley Visit in Disney Dreamlight Valley:

 Can Be Done In Multiplayer   Buy Items Present In Scrooge&#39;s Store   Change Outfits   Pick Flowers   Take Photos   Drop Items From Inventory And Pick Up Dropped Items   Find And Collect Pixel Shards   






Like Timmy and Tommy&#39;s store in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Scrooge&#39;s store will offer a different selection of items in each player&#39;s game each day. So visiting other Valleys can provide an opportunity to purchase items that may not have shown up in a home store. Unfortunately, other than actively buying items, players cannot interact with Mr. McDuck to place any special orders or chat with him.



Scrooge will only sell one of each item in his store each day, so if one player buys an item, nobody else will be able to purchase it.




Pixel Shards are an all-new resource to the game which are only obtained during Valley Visit experiences. During a Valley Visit, Pixel Shards will spawn around the Valley, but they will disappear once the connection is closed. These Shards are used for crafting special buffs to be used in cooking or crafting and seem to be designed to be a fun enticement for people to try out multiplayer.




Sadly, the list of what can be done during multiplayer Valley Visits is not very long and does not feature many of the best activities that Disney Dreamlight Valley is known for. According to the FAQ page for the game, much more will be added in the future to make the system more fun and engaging.


&#34;This is just the beginning, though. We plan to continue building upon the multiplayer feature in future updates, introducing new ways to interact with your friends!&#34; - Disney Dreamlight Valley FAQ


There is no current timeline as to when these future updates will be added, but the game is already scheduled to have many more free content updates coming in late winter, spring, and summer.

 What Players Cannot Do During Valley Visits 
Whether Visiting Or Hosting
          

Any time a Valley Visit is active, the game will be restricted in many ways for everyone in that Valley, including the host. Many of the most common activities that make up the typical gameplay of Disney Dreamlight Valley are not available, including talking with villagers or using any tool. Here is the full list of what cannot be done while multiplayer is turned on:

 Cannot Be Done In Multiplayer   Use Any Tools   Trade Clothing Or Furniture   Talk With Villagers   Cook Meals   Harvest Crops, Fruits, Or Any Resource   Complete Quests   Fast Travel   Place Or Remove Decorations   






Being able to have friends and family come and visit a Valley and see the way people have decorated or just enjoy taking selfies with each other&#39;s avatars can still be a lot of fun. However, this list of what activities cannot be done during multiplayer is even more restrictive than was seen in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where at least the use of tools and talking to villagers was allowed. Having multiplayer access is a step in the right direction, yet Disney Dreamlight Valley still has a long way to go before this feature will be very useful beyond just a short tour of homes.
