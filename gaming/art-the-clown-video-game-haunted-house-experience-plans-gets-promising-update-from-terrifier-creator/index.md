Exclusive: Terrifier creator Damien Leone teases his plans for an Art the Clown video game and haunted house experience amid franchise&#39;s success.


Summary

  Terrifier&#39;s growing popularity makes it likely for Art the Clown to have his own haunted house experience or video game.   The sequel introduced unique locations perfect for a theme park walk-through, such as the fun house and fantasy realm.   The success of horror games like Dead by Daylight opens up the possibility for Art and Sienna to join the popular title in the future.  





As the viral horror franchise continues to grow, Damien Leone teases plans for a Terrifier video game and haunted house experience. The slasher movies center on the menacing Art the Clown as he enjoys a bloody streak of murders in a fictional New York town, as well as survivors Victoria Heyes and Sienna Shaw as they grapple with the trauma of encountering the killer. Though the first movie garnered mixed reviews, its 2022 sequel was a critical and commercial hit, opening the door for 2024&#39;s Terrifier 3 and potentially further installments.




During an interview with Screen Rant for Terrifier 2&#39;s re-release, Leone was asked his thoughts on further expanding the franchise into other mediums, including the world of haunted house experiences made popular by Universal&#39;s Halloween Horror Nights. The creator not only confirmed his &#34;dream&#34; of doing so, but teased that there have &#34;already been talks&#34; of making such a thing happen, while also indicating talks of making an Art the Clown video game at some point in the future. See what Leone shared below:


Oh, I would love it, and that&#39;s a dream. I would love to have a house in Halloween Horror Nights. There&#39;s already been talks of it over the years, so hopefully that becomes a reality because, like you said, there&#39;s just so many cool environments, and now we&#39;re adding all these cool characters besides Art the Clown, these other creepy characters that you could really put in there, it could be a really cool experience. Also, I would love a video game. We were just playing the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre game, we were at the makers of the game, in their office where they created the game and everything, a couple of nights ago and that was so cool. He would lend himself so well to a video game like that, you could be trapped in the warehouse surviving from the original Terrifier or you could be in the Terrifier haunted attraction from the end of Terrifier 2, it could be so much fun. It would be cool to be Sienna, too, I think to be this hero fighting Art the Clown decked out in this armor, it&#39;d be cool for the victim and the villain, it would be a great game, and there&#39;s interest there too, so hopefully those happen in the near future.






 Why Terrifier Is Perfect For Further Expansion 
         

Given how viral of a property the Terrifier franchise has become in recent years, it seems only a matter of time for Art the Clown to get his very own haunted house experience, or appear in a video game. In particular, the 2022 horror sequel introduced a wide variety of locations that would be perfect for theme park guests to walk through in the former, namely the fun house Art stalks Sienna and her friends through in the movie&#39;s final act, as well as the bizarre fantasy realm Sienna visits in both her dreams and in waking life.

Additionally, recent years have seen the world of horror gaming grow thanks to the likes of Dead by Daylight, Evil Dead: The Game and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Behaviour Interactive&#39;s multiplayer survival game has even seen various genre icons get licensed for downloadable content, including Halloween&#39;s Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, A Nightmare on Elm Street&#39;s Freddy Krueger and Stranger Things&#39; Steve and the Demogorgon. Considering the game continues to be a popular title with players, it would be interesting to see if Leone teams with Behaviour to bring Art and Sienna to Dead by Daylight.






Dead by Daylight&#39;s success is leading to the game making its own medium expansion with a movie adaptation produced by Blumhouse Productions and James Wan&#39;s Atomic Monster.




The biggest vote of confidence for the Terrifier franchise expanding into other mediums will be how the upcoming third movie performs. The surprise success of the 2022 sequel has created much anticipation for the next installment in the franchise, and with the threequel promising a larger budget and a Christmas setting, Leone and his creative team look to be raising the bar for Sienna&#39;s next battle against the menacing slasher.
