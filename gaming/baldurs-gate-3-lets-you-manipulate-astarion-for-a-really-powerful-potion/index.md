# Baldurs Gate 3 Lets You Manipulate Astarion For A Really Powerful Potion


## SUMMARY 



  A Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 interaction offers a very powerful potion, but getting it involves taking advantage of Astarion.   A character named Araj in Moonrise Towers offers a Potion of Everlasting Vigor in exchange for Astarion drinking her blood.   Forcing Astarion to drink Araj&#39;s blood will cause him to end any romance he may have with the player character, unless they manipulate Astarion further.

## Literature Review

One choice in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 seems like a cruel approach to companionship, but it&#39;s the only way to get maximal benefits from a unique situation.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 often rewards good behavior, but getting one powerful potion requires manipulating Astarion in a way that&#39;s very far from a healthy interaction. Although Astarion isn&#39;t exactly the most morally upright of potential party members, it becomes easier to understand why he is the way he is once the darker depths of his backstory are revealed. Ideally, finding out his secrets would allow the protagonist to avoid reawakening any of his old wounds. Sometimes, however, the prospect of power is simply more alluring than the alternatives.




The moment in question arises as an opportunity in Moonrise Towers, the major Act 2 destination where General Ketheric Thorm amasses an army of followers to serve his wicked schemes. It&#39;s possible to enter Moonrise without initially triggering any form of hostility, which leads to plenty of potential unique interactions with the various NPCs gathered inside. Many of them haunt the main halls, including some vendors with desirable items, but others can be found going about their business alone in various chambers. One such character is Araj Oblodra, who has an interesting proposal involving Astarion&#39;s blood to put forward.

  


 Manipulating Astarion Can Permanently Boost Strength In BG3 
         




Although most Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 characters would likely shy away from a vampire bite, Araj requests one specifically, professing an interest in studying its effects. In exchange for the favor, Araj will provide a Potion of Everlasting Vigor, which grants a permanent &#43;2 buff to the Strength of whoever drinks it. Considering most potions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 only grant temporary effects, increasing a major stat and having it stick is a hard thing to pass up, and the desirability of the potion is boosted by the fact that there&#39;s no other way to get it in game.



Other characters can trade their blood to Araj for a variety of potions, although none of the other options are as strong as the Potion of Everlasting Vigor.




Unfortunately, Astarion isn&#39;t as keen on accepting the deal as a player might be, and convincing him to get on board without incurring serious repercussions can require an underhanded approach. Araj may find Astarion&#39;s blood (and that of all party members) appealing, but he has quite the opposite opinion of hers, and it&#39;s clear that it would sicken him to take a sip. Although he can be persuaded to partake in the act at the cost of disapproval, anyone romancing Astarion will have to deal with a second conversation that makes it clear just how much of a deal-breaker the scenario was for him.




                  Neil Newbon On Being &#34;Incredibly Blessed By Astarion&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Neil Newbon discusses playing companion Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, helping direct his fellow actors, and the game&#39;s incredible possibilities.   

The confrontation with Astarion after telling him to suck Araj&#39;s blood occurs at the next camp, when he approaches the protagonist to complain about the lingering taste of the blood. Navigating this encounter while avoiding a break-up requires a very specific sequence of responses, one of which reads &#34;Are you not attracted to me? Is that it?&#34; In the context of the situation, it&#39;s obvious that this isn&#39;t the reason for his distress, and it&#39;s a clear manipulation of his perspective that pushes the blame on the victim. Taking any course that seems more humane, however, will result in him severing his romantic relationship with the protagonist.



 Why Making Astarion Drink Araj&#39;s Blood In BG3 Is Cruel 
          




Pressuring Astarion to do something that makes him bodily uncomfortable is obviously gross behavior in general, but it takes on an extra layer of cruelty when his backstory is considered. Astarion is no stranger to having his own will and ability to properly give consent overridden, as his life as a vampire spawn placed him as an agent of Cazador&#39;s bidding. He only became a vampire spawn to begin with after ending up at death&#39;s door after a brutal attack, leaving him with no other choice but to sign his own self away in order to survive.

                  Astarion&#39;s Story Arc In BG3 Proves The Good Guy Finishes Last   Choosing not to ascend and stay a Vampire Spawn as Astarion is the morally good ending for him in Baldurâ€™s Gate 3, but it comes at a cost.   

With Astarion in his debt, Cazador forced him to lure victims to the lair for nothing more than rats to eat in return. Cazador would also torture him for the vampire lord&#39;s own amusement, making Astarion no stranger to pain at the behest of another. None of this makes Astarion&#39;s own predilection for hurting others any more appealing, but it does help to explain how he ended up mistrusting others and seeing power as the primary axis of interaction. It also makes compelling him to employ his vampirism in a situation that makes him uncomfortable especially horrifying, considering how directly such an act would link to his past trauma.






 Tricking Astarion In BG3 Might Still Be Worth It 
          

As horrific as it is to admit, the advantages of tricking Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are hard to ignore. It isn&#39;t hard to make up a little loss of disapproval, and the Potion of Everlasting Vigor is a great resource to have on hand going into the Act 2 finale and everything that Act 3 has at its disposal. Manipulating Astarion is the only way to maintain a romance with the vampire spawn after going down this path, and it doesn&#39;t have any specifically bad effects outside of the inherent sacrifice of morality necessary to make it happen.

The only real reason to avoid this path is in the name of true roleplay dedication, as a good-aligned character who treats companions kindly wouldn&#39;t be likely to exploit Astarion&#39;s weaknesses in such a Machiavellian way. Of course, anyone who isn&#39;t pursuing a relationship with Astarion can avoid the manipulation part of the encounter, although persuading him to do something he&#39;s clearly uncomfortable with will be necessary to get the potion in any scenario. Of course, Astarion himself has stood on shaky grounds with the protagonist&#39;s own consent to bloodsucking in the past, but that doesn&#39;t make vindictive behavior ethical.




Most Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 campaigns will end up incurring at least a scenario or two that leaves the player feeling somewhat dirty, and manipulating Astarion in order to get the Potion of Everlasting Vigor is one that&#39;s sure to be remembered. It&#39;s a bit heartbreaking that there&#39;s no way to keep a relationship going through a gentler approach, although making him suck Araj&#39;s blood is a bit of a bridge burned in that area regardless. Manipulating Astarion is only one of the many ways to get ahead in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it represents a truly insidious kind of evil purely in the name of one great potion.
