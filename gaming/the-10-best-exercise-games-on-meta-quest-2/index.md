 10 Essential Meta Quest 2 Games You&#39;ll Want To Download &amp; Play First 
Over 500 games are available for the Meta Quest 2, which can be a daunting thought, but here are 10 of the best ones to add to a VR game library.












 








 10  Dance Like No One Is Watching With Dance Central VR 
Immersive Dance Club Experience
        

Dance Central VR is the ideal game for those who enjoy grooving to a good beat. With 32 top hits to choose from and two different difficulty settings, anyone from an amateur to a seasoned dancer can get a good workout in Dance Central VR. Players are more than welcome to dance like nobody&#39;s watching, but Dance Central VR also features real-time online multiplayer, meaning it&#39;s possible for friends to dance it out together.





 9  Synth Riders Is A Party &amp; Fitness Routine 
Dance And Rhythm Game
        

Another one of the best exercise games for the Meta Quest 2 is Synth Riders, which can turn an empty room into a mini rave. As its name would imply, Synth Riders focuses on electronic music genres, like EDM, synthpop, house, and more, all while tasking players with dodging moving obstacles and hitting notes to the beat. With multiplayer supporting up to ten players, and with the custom songs feature letting users upload their own music, Synth Riders is just as much of a party as it is a fitness routine.





 8  Until You Fall Is A Fun, Randomized Hack &#39;n Slash 
Hack And Slash Roguelite Adventure


 







Until You Fall also features a synthwave soundtrack for lovers of electronic music, but its gameplay differs greatly from Synth Riders. In this game, players are thrown into an immersive roguelite adventure, where they&#39;ll need to defeat waves of dangerous enemies all while staying in rhythm. Luckily, players can arm themselves with various melee weapons, shields, and even magic as they fight their way through this futuristic world. Each run is randomized, so players will need to stay on their toes (both physically, and metaphorically) if they wish to survive for as long as possible in Until You Fall.
            
 
 Until You Fall Review: VR Hack-and-Slash At Its Pinnacle 
Until You Fall has a revolutionary physics system as well as strong combat and progression mechanics that combine to make a fantastic VR roguelike.








 7  Supernatural Offers Guided Workouts 
Workout And Fitness Program
        

If the life-or-death pressure of Until You Fall is a bit too intense, players can enjoy a more realistic, scripted experience while still taking in gorgeous futuristic vistas in Supernatural. This Meta Quest 2 fitness program gives players access to over 500 different routines - ranging from high-intensity cardio to more relaxed yoga. Even guided meditations can be joined for a relaxing moment of self-care. The best part about Supernatural is that each workout is guided by a coach, who can offer helpful direction, advice, and even words of motivation.
Supernatural requires a monthly or yearly membership subscription in order to use. 






 6  Blaston Offers Great Exercise 
PvP VR Shooter


 







Blaston is free-to-play, and not marketed as a fitness game, yet it manages to be one of the best exercise games on the Meta Quest 2. It&#39;s a high-intensity, first-person shooter experience, wherein players will not only need to shoot and kill enemies but also dodge incoming bullets and projectiles to stay alive. Blaston is the optimal choice for those looking not only to get their blood pumping but also for those looking for a challenge, as the game allows players to compete against others in mini-tournaments.





 5  OhShape Is An Excellent Workout VR Experience 
Rhythm Fitness Game
        

OhShape is far from a relaxing Meta Quest 2 game, even though the minimalist look that it uses and the ease and simplicity of its rules might at first make one think otherwise. In this fitness game, players need to twist and turn their bodies in all sorts of shapes as they attempt to match silhouette cut-outs on fast-approaching panels. Though that sounds easy enough, it is difficult to pull off, and can quickly become an aerobic activity. With a catchy soundtrack on each level, OhShape is an engaging experience that will have users breaking a sweat before long.

 4  FitXR Offers Realistic Workouts &amp; Routines 
Fitness Program
        

FitXR is a basic, yet effective choice for those truly looking to hone their skills in certain areas of fitness. FitXR offers realistic, down-to-earth exercise routines, led by real-life coaches, choreographers, and motivational speakers to provide players with the highest-quality experience. New classes are added regularly to each studio, including boxing, HIIT, dance, sculpting, and even combat. This game can turn the player&#39;s living room into a personalized workout class.
FitXR requires a monthly or yearly membership subscription to participate.  






 3  The Thrill Of The Fight Is Perfect For Boxing Enthusiasts 
VR Boxing
        

For those specifically wanting to throw some punches, The Thrill of the Fight is the best boxing game on the Meta Quest 2. Players will need to work their way up from the bottom, first sparring with lower-level opponents, then moving up to the more difficult, professional fighters as they track and improve their skills over time. Plus, by playing The Thrill of the Fight, there&#39;s no need to worry about actually getting injured in the ring; players are free to learn to box at their own pace, all while remaining in the comfort of their own homes.





 2  Pistol Whip Offers FPS &amp; Fitness 
Rhythm-Based VR Shooter
        

Pistol Whip combines the best of both the fitness world and first-person shooters to create an invigorating and endlessly entertaining package. This game lets players live out their action hero dreams as they conquer dozens of scenes, dodging bullets and defeating hordes of enemies with a satisfying soundtrack and even more satisfying gameplay. Although the high-octane nature of Pistol Whip oftentimes makes for an extreme workout, players are still bound to feel cool, even through all the sweat.





 1  Beat Saber Is Still The Best VR Has To Offer 
Rhythm Game


 







The best exercise game is also perhaps the most well-known VR game in existence, Beat Saber. In this game, players wield two lightsabers, with which they&#39;ll need to hit incoming blocks in beat with the current song. It&#39;s a rather simple concept on paper, but with the added task of hitting the blocks in the right direction, dodging the wrong blocks, and with Beat Saber&#39;s new block additions, things can get unexpectedly intense.
As players attempt to get the highest score possible, they won&#39;t even notice how much they&#39;re moving until the song is over, making it an effective full-body workout. Plus, with new music packs featuring popular artists constantly being added, there&#39;s always a reason to come back to the game. Beat Saber disguises workouts with its exhilarating gameplay, making it the best exercise game for the virtual reality world of Meta Quest 2.
