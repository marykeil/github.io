## Literature Review

The slate of RPGs in 2024 is already pretty full, and there&#39;s some particularly exciting titles that stand out among the options coming to the table.




2024 is looking to be a great year for RPGs, with a strong selection of titles that show promise across different stylistic and narrative angles. RPG fans had plenty to pick from in 2023, and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 showed just how big the market could be for something that emphasized the depth of choices and possibilities. Games like Final Fantasy 16 and Octopath Traveler 2 made a strong showing for Japanese RPGs, and Lies of P registered with audiences in a way that only a minority of Soulslikes have managed.
A couple of the most exciting RPGs for 2024 revisit past hits with a fresh coat of paint, but the upcoming roster has a particular emphasis on new experiences. From turn-based combat to spectacle-oriented action, there&#39;s no shortage of gameplay variety, and the settings and art styles are equally diverse. The most anticipated 2024 RPGs are only the tip of the iceberg for the overall slate of roleplaying titles releasing, but they&#39;re all exciting and ambitious projects that could represent the best of what the genre has to offer.
            
 
 10 Best RPGs Of 2023 
From Final Fantasy XVI to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, this was a great year for RPGs, but these ten games stood out as the best of the bunch in 2023.












 








 10  Granblue Fantasy: Relink 
Cygames
        

  Granblue Fantasy: Relink  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Steam     Released    February 1, 2024     Developer(s)    Cygames , PlatinumGames     Genre(s)    Action , RPG     Franchise    Granblue Fantasy     Publisher(s)    Cygames     ESRB    Not Yet Rated    


Granblue Fantasy: Relink is based on a mobile RPG franchise, but this console release takes things to a radically different scale. Gorgeous graphics and fluid combat make it an immediately attractive standout among upcoming releases, and music composed by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu should help it achieve some of the appeal of genre classics. The non-linear character unlocks sound like a slightly weird evolution of mobile game tendencies, but it&#39;s not built on a gacha system or in-game monetization, so it shouldn&#39;t be a big concern.





 9  Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden 
Don&#39;t Nod
        

Don&#39;t Nod might be most famous for its Life Is Strange adventure titles, but Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden won&#39;t be the studio&#39;s first foray into the RPG genre, hopefully building on experience from 2018&#39;s Vampyr. With a focus on story and a supernatural bent, this could be an interesting title for horror fans as well. Don&#39;t Nod has been highlighting the impact of choices in marketing material, so significant replayability should be on the table if Banishers sticks the landing.





 8  Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes 
Rabbit And Bear Studios
        

  Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    April 23, 2024     Developer(s)    Rabbit and Bear Studios     Prequel(s)    Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising     Publisher(s)    505 Games     Genre(s)    RPG     ESRB    T    


Fans of the Japanese RPG series Suikoden should feel right at home with Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, a spiritual successor directed by the creator of the classic franchise. In keeping with that tradition, the Hundred Heroes subtitle is no idle promise, with an enormous variety of potential party members to recruit across the course of the journey. The action-oriented preamble Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising acquitted itself fairly well, so hopefully the main feature will hit a home run.





 7  Black Myth: Wukong 
Game Science


 







The classic Chinese novel Journey to the West has seen its fair share of culturally relevant retellings, and Black Myth: Wukong is aiming to be the next big one. Gameplay footage for Black Myth: Wukong has shown off a bevy of incredible set pieces, so it should be cinematic if nothing else. As developer Game Science hasn&#39;t tackled a product on this scale before, the game&#39;s overall success as an RPG remains to be seen, but it certainly looks promising.





 6  Persona 3: Reload 
P-Studio
        

  Persona 3 Reload  


  Franchise    Persona     Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    February 2, 2024     Developer(s)    Atlus     Publisher(s)    Sega     Genre(s)    Action , Life Simulation , RPG     ESRB    M    


Persona 3: Reload doesn&#39;t have all that much to prove, as the original Persona 3 is already an acclaimed entry in the popular Shin Megami Tensei spin-off series. Although the remake lacks additions made in Persona 3 FES and Portable, it does bring a number of graphical improvements and quality-of-life additions to the table. Persona 3: Reload may not be as fresh as other exciting 2024 RPGs, but it could be the perfect way for fans of Persona 4 and 5 to experience their predecessor for the first time.

 5  Rise Of The Ronin 
Team Ninja
        

  Rise of the Ronin  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 5     Released    March 22, 2024     Developer(s)    Team Ninja     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment , Koei Tecmo     Genre(s)    Action-Adventure , RPG     ESRB    M    


Team Ninja is responsible for games like Nioh and Ninja Gaiden, so the studio has a very practiced hand at sculpting exciting (and challenging) action. Rise of the Ronin should be no exception, and the historical Japanese setting looks to be beautifully designed and rendered. Team Ninja hasn&#39;t attempted an open world like this before, but if it can pull off that aspect, Rise of the Ronin could be a real hit.





 4  Avowed 
Obsidian Entertainment


 







Avowed could be the perfect game for fans of titles like The Elder Scrolls, with a similar first-person RPG approach to a fantasy world. In this case, that setting is the world of Eora from developer Obsidian Entertainment&#39;s Pillars of Eternity series, which garnered its fair share of acclaim. Published by Xbox Game Studios, Avowed is an anticipated Xbox console exclusive, and its arrival on Xbox Game Pass in 2024 should quickly hook in a playerbase.





 3  Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth 
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio
        

  Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth  


  Franchise    Yakuza     Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    January 26, 2024     Developer(s)    Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , RPG , Simulation     Publisher(s)    Sega     ESRB    M    


Like a Dragon, formerly known as Yakuza in the West, is the kind of series that tends to convert players into die-hard and vocal supporters of the franchise. Infinite Wealth continues the story of Ichiban Kasuga, who teams up with original protagonist Kiryu Kazuma in an adventure that adds a Hawaiian setting to the usual Japanese haunts. From ambitious mini-games to charming side quests, there should be no shortage of engaging material in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.

 2  Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 
Capcom
        

  Dragon&#39;s Dogma II  


  Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 22, 2024     Developer(s)    Capcom     Publisher(s)    Capcom     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure , RPG     ESRB    M     Prequel(s)    Dragon&#39;s Dogma    


Dragon&#39;s Dogma is perennially championed as an under-appreciated title, with a unique and ambitious approach to combat that made it stand apart from other RPGs. If Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 can successfully build on that foundation and patch over a number of issues that the first title had, it should be set for mainstream success. There&#39;s no need to worry about playing the original game first, as Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 is set in a parallel world full of new characters and narrative elements.





 1  Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth 
Square Enix


 







  Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth  


  Franchise    Final Fantasy 7     Platform(s)    PlayStation 5     Released    February 29, 2024     Developer(s)    Square Enix Business Division 1     Genre(s)    Action RPG , Adventure     Publisher(s)    Square Enix     ESRB    T    


Much like its predecessor, FF7 Remake, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is more than just a remake, taking a new angle on a beloved story and expanding the scope in a variety of ways. The legacy surrounding Final Fantasy 7 is strong enough to potentially make Rebirth an even more anticipated title than 2023&#39;s mainline entry Final Fantasy 16, and anyone familiar with the adventures of Cloud and company should be able to understand why. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is set to take the gaming world by storm in 2024, and it&#39;s hard to imagine much more excitement for any RPG.
