## Literature Review

To get Sand Claws in LEGO Fortnite, players must hunt and kill Sand Wolves: vicious predators that only appear at night. Preparation is essential.





To find Sand Wolves, you first need to head to the Dry Valley desert biome or the nearest beach. Sand Wolves only spawn in sandy areas and only appear at night. This makes it even more difficult for players to hunt, as other hostile creatures may also attack. The best approach is to treat the desert like one of Fortnite’s most popular seasonal landing spots and be alert for any danger.




                  8 Best Landing Spots In Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1   Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 introduces a new island with a high-speed rail network, tough bosses, and excellent landing spots for players to try out.   


 How To Find &amp; Beat Sand Wolves 
          

Sand Wolves are incredibly tough even if you already have mid-game gear, but they have weaknesses that can be exploited. It’s highly recommended that you bring some help and have another player or one of your Villager recruits in Fortnite join you on the hunt. There’s safety in numbers, particularly at night, and Sand Wolves can only attack one player at a time. This provides other players a window to attack.

          




You can also attack from range. Much like the Skeletons, which might attack you while you are searching for Marble in Fortnite, Sand Wolves can only attack at close range. You can take advantage of this weakness by using ranged weapons such as the Recurve Crossbow and the dodge roll to put some distance between you and a hostile Sand Wolf.



Watch out for melee attacks even at range, as Sand Wolves move quickly and can lunge at you surprisingly fast.




Alternatively, you can face a Sand Wolf at close range with a sturdy shield in your off-hand slot. This is a little risky, as you won’t be able to hold a torch in your off-hand for better visibility at night. However, a shield can also minimize the damage you take, allowing you to deliver the final blow.



 How To Use Sand Claws 
          




Luckily, Sand Wolves drop four Sand Claws when killed, so you won’t need to hunt down too many. Sand Claws are used for various items and upgrades, including upgrading the Crafting Bench and building the Loom and Gem Cutter.

You will eventually need Sand Claws to progress further into the game. However, LEGO Fortnite’s desert biomes hold many dangers, and you should prepare for a difficult journey if you go exploring at night.
