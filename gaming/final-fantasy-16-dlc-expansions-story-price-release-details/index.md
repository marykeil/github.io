## Literature Review

Two DLC expansions for Final Fantasy 16 were announced at The Game Awards 2023. Here’s everything there is to know about FF16’s new and upcoming DLC.




At long last, Final Fantasy 16 has announced not one, but two DLC expansions: Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide. This announcement comes roughly six months after the game&#39;s initial release on June 22, 2023. Although Final Fantasy 16 was dubbed a modern masterpiece for its thrilling approach to action RPG combat and its daring approach to mature storytelling, it also had some obvious gaps, some of which seemed to hint towards answers in future DLC.




FF16&#39;s two DLCs made up one of the biggest announcements at The Game Awards 2023, where it was unveiled with a 90-second trailer showcasing combat and the slightest hint of story. Composer Masayoshi Soken also took home the award for Best Score and Music for his work on FF16. Here&#39;s everything to know so far about FF16&#39;s two DLCs.

                  Final Fantasy 16 DLC Won&#39;t Repeat FF15&#39;s Biggest DLC Mistake   In many ways, Final Fantasy 16 compensates for the mistakes made by Final Fantasy 15, and those improvements should extend to its approach to DLC.   


 FF16 DLC: Release Date 
Echoes Of The Fallen Is Out Now, The Rising Tide Is Coming Soon
          

The first of two FF16 DLCs, Echoes of the Fallen, was shadow dropped during The Game Awards, meaning that it&#39;s available now for download and play. The Rising Tide has set a tentative release date for Spring 2024; it&#39;s a pretty wide window, but at most, it&#39;s six months away from the initial announcement. Further details about its release date will likely be revealed in the coming months.

Both of FF16&#39;s DLCs are exclusive to PS5, at least for the time being. The PC version of FF16 is in development, but there&#39;s no word yet of a release date. While many speculated it would be out in late 2023, immediately after Square Enix&#39;s exclusivity deal with PlayStation expired, it&#39;s early December and no such announcement has materialized. It&#39;s also impossible to say at this point whether FF16&#39;s two DLCs will be available on PC at the time of its initial release, or whether they&#39;ll come out several months later like the PS5 versions.






 FF16 DLC: Price 
          

The first of two FF16 DLCs, Echoes of the Fallen, is now available for $9.99 USD via the PlayStation Store. Both DLCs can be purchased together in the form of FF16&#39;s Expansion Pass, which costs $24.99. The Rising Tide&#39;s price point has yet to be revealed, but since the Expansion Pass is advertised as containing both DLCs at a discount, it&#39;s more or less confirmed that it&#39;ll be more expensive than Echoes of the Fallen. The average, full story expansion-sized DLC usually goes for $29.99, so it&#39;s quite possible that The Rising Tide will land around the same price.



 FF16 DLC: Story 
         




Due to certain occurrences at the ending of Final Fantasy 16, all DLC must logically take place before its final chapters. FF16&#39;s DLC announcement seems to confirm this is the case. The trailer begins with a clip from Echoes of the Fallen, in which The Hideaway&#39;s merchant Charon presents Clive with a mysterious dark crystal. Apparently, crystals like this one are flooding the black market, hawked by a group of suspicious traders. Crystals are the source of basically all natural resources in FF16, but are in short supply - these dark crystals appear to offer the same benefits, but perhaps at a higher, hidden price.

Eventually, the investigation into these crystals leads Clive, Jill, Joshua, and Torgal to a new Fallen ruin called the Sagespire. It&#39;s here that they&#39;ll learn some uncomfortable secrets about the Magitek War as they face off against a powerful, ancient defense system. They&#39;ll fight a variety of mechanized bosses, including Sigma, Omicron, and Omega, as they climb the spire and attempt to understand the dark crystals&#39; origins.




Relatively little is known about The Rising Tide&#39;s story, but it&#39;s possible to guess based on the brief preview in the trailer and what appear to be intentional gaps left in FF16&#39;s story. In FF16, those called Dominants are able to commune with the Mothercrystals to harness the power of Eikons, terrible and omnipotent gods. In-game loremaster Harpocrates explains that there were once eight Eikons in Valisthea, despite only five appearing during the plot. One of the missing Eikons is Leviathan, a water elemental.

Each Eikon is a recurring Final Fantasy staple; Ifrit, Phoenix, Bahamut, Shiva, Titan, Garuda, Ramuh, and Odin appear in most Final Fantasy games in one capacity or another: usually as bosses and/or summonable allies. The same goes for Leviathan, and while its existence is occasionally touched upon through paintings and lore references, it never actually appears in the game. As a result, many refer to the absent Eikon as Leviathan the Lost. But it looks like someone finally found it, because Leviathan appears to be the main subject of The Rising Tide.




Leviathan will appear both as an enemy and as a summon. Clive is seen facing the serpentine Eikon as Ifrit in one of Final Fantasy 16&#39;s epic Eikon boss fights. Later on, he also appears to have semi-primed as Leviathan in a battle: a &#34;Tidal Gauge&#34; appears on screen, along with a variety of water-themed moves like Tidal Spray, Tidal Spit, and Refill. The brief preview of the second DLC shows Clive and company investigating a mysterious blue beam that has appeared in the distant sky. It&#39;ll also include a new map, Missidia, a hilly region composed of both small towns and wild areas.



 FF16 DLC: Bonuses 
Claim Cloud&#39;s Buster Sword In FF16
          

Purchasing either Echoes of the Fallen individually or the entire DLC Expansion Pass unlocks Cloud Strife&#39;s Buster Sword from FF7 in FF16. After purchasing either and completing the game through the main quest &#34;A Chance Encounter,&#34; players can claim the Buster Sword by navigating to the &#34;Redeemable Items&#34; section of the System menu. Purchasing the DLC also grants access to the &#34;Away&#34; Orchestrion Roll, which allows players to listen to one of FF16&#39;s most thrilling boss themes in The Hideaway. And of course, both DLCs raise Clive&#39;s level cap, while adding new weapons, accessories, bosses, and areas to the game.




It&#39;s clear that the FF16 story isn&#39;t over yet. With one expansion out now, another well on its way, an upcoming PC release, and whatever else is in store, Final Fantasy 16 still has a lot on the horizon.
