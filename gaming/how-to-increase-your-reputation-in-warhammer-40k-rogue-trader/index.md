## Literature Review

If you want to get your hands on more goodies from each faction&#39;s merchant in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you&#39;ll need to raise your Reputation.





At the same time, when it comes to trading, reputation isn&#39;t the only factor to consider. You also need to be focused on increasing your Profit Factor, which is another important in-game mechanic that determines what you can and cannot purchase from the faction&#39;s vendors. As a result, reputation and Profit Factor go hand in hand, and you&#39;ll need to work on increasing both if you want to gain access to new items from the traders.






You can view both your reputation and Profit Factor on the left-hand window of the &#34;Trading&#34; tab.

 Improving Your Reputation in Rogue Trader 
          

You can increase your reputation in Rogue Trader in multiple ways. Firstly, you can earn reputation by choosing the right dialogue options or by choosing to help a certain faction when the opportunity presents itself. While these do give a significant boost to your reputation, the opportunities don&#39;t come by very often.




Another way to increase your reputation is by trading cargo to factions. This is done by going to the &#34;Reputation&#34; tab in the trading window. You can only trade cargo types, such as Provisions or Ranged Weaponry, once they&#39;re above 100%. Simultaneously, the factions must be interested in the cargo for you to sell it to them. As a result, make sure to check each merchant to ensure you&#39;re getting the most reputation in exchange for your cargo, as some vendors will pay more for certain types of cargo.

Colony Projects
Colony Projects are the final, and arguably best, way to gain reputation with faction vendors. Colony Projects become available in Act 2 and provide both reputation and Profit Factor points as potential rewards. As a result, you&#39;ll want to prioritize Colony Projects as soon as you gain access to them because they are a consistent and efficient way to earn both reputation and Profit Factor points. Furthermore, the rewards from these projects only increase as you progress through the Tiers.






 All Faction Vendors and Where to Find Them 
          

You can trade with five different factions in the game, each with its own vendor. All of them can be found in Act 1 and shouldn&#39;t require too much running around to locate.

 Faction  Merchant Name  Location   Drusians  Hieronymus Doloroso  Footfall Atrium, Furibundus System.   Explorators  Opticon-22  Footfall&#39;s Void Dock Alpha-Rho.   Kasballica Mission  Vladaym Tocara The Liege  Governer&#39;s building at the end of Footfall Atrium.   Fellowship of the Void  Ryzza  Bar in the Footfall Shadow Quarters.   Imperial Navy  Chartist Captain Austerius Thorfast  Hail a ship in the Furibundus System called Drususâ€™s Blessing.   



Furthermore, rather than going to each merchant&#39;s location whenever you want to trade with them, you can simply talk to High Factotum Janris Danrok, an NPC on your voidship to quickly access traders.




When speaking to him, choose &#34;I would like to order the shipping and transportation of some goods&#34;. This will open the merchant trading tab (pictured above), which allows you to quickly access all the traders from your ship in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.
