## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way fans suspect Sumit Singh&#39;s mother Sadhna is still not happy with Jenny Slatten after looking at Sadhna&#39;s new photos.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way fans suspect Sumit Singh’s mother Sadhna Singh and Jenny Slatten’s happy reunion isn&#39;t as positive as it appears. Jenny was 30 years older than Sumit when they decided to date each other in 2012. Sumit used to play Facebook games with Jenny under a fake profile name called Michael Jones when the Palm Springs woman fell for him. Despite the catfishing, Sumit and Jenny began a long-distance relationship. Jenny went to India to meet Sumit the next year and began an intimate relationship while living in his parents’ house. Sumit’s family got him married off to another woman whom he later divorced to marry Jenny.




Sumit’s mother refused to accept Jenny as her daughter-in-law on 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? but January 2024’s 90 Day Diaries had them revealing Sadhna has turned over a new leaf.


 

Sumit posted photos of him and Jenny on a trip to Jaipur with his parents, younger brother Amit, Amit&#39;s wife, and baby. “I hope you guys watched diaries and our segment where finally my mom accepted @jan_frmsan,” Sumit wrote in his caption. However, fans commented things like, “She still don&#39;t look to [sic] thrilled but its def a gd step!” and “I don’t think so. Her face says it all. She does NOT look happy in these pics.”

 Jenny&#39;s History With Sumit&#39;s Family Explained 
          

Sumit said that he had the option to leave his family for Jenny, but they kept trying to get his family to accept them as a couple. “And finally the day came,” Sumit wrote to celebrate the happy occasion that fans never thought they were going to witness in Sumit and Jenny’s storyline. It could be a major reason why most fans in Sumit’s comments section aren’t convinced that Sadhna is now okay with Jenny, who’s older than her, being her daughter-in-law. “Finally jenny I&#39;m so happy for you! I don&#39;t think your mother-in-law&#39;s heart is completely in it. But at least she has accepted,” a fan told Jenny.

Sumit’s mother considered Jenny her friend when she stayed with them in their house for two months. She felt betrayed when they realized Sumit and Jenny were in a relationship. Jenny’s arrival in India in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 1 led to Sumit’s split with his ex-wife. Sumit then started living with Jenny in a different house. Sumit’s mother was worried about society judging their family. “I will never, ever let you marry her!” she told Sumit before threatening him that she would commit suicide if he went against his wishes. Sumit and Jenny got married in secret, which came as a bigger blow to Sadhna.




Eventually, Sumit’s father Anil accepted Jenny during the Happily Ever After? season 6 Tell All. Sadhna had yet to come around. The latest episode of 90 Day Diaries saw Sadhna and Anil telling the cameras that their way of thinking changed gradually, and they realized that they couldn’t change “everything in life” and had to accept things as they were. Sadhna is seemingly now happy as long as her son is happy. Sumit and Jenny’s 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way storyline has finally received its happy ending.
