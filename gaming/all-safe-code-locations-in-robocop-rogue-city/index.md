## Literature Review

There are four safes scattered around Detroit in Robocop Rogue City, with codes that open all of these protected containers depending on your skills.





There are five safes you might find as you explore Detroit, each guarded by many of the city&#39;s criminals. Taking down enemies is the easy part, especially if you aren&#39;t close to one of the three endings to Robocop: Rogue City. Recovering the fake money, stolen jewelry, incriminating documents, and even a nuke from a safe will advance your &#34;Police Work&#34; mission near the start of the game.




                  RoboCop: Rogue City Ending Explained (In Detail)   RoboCop: Rogue City is a phenomenal game that gives the player plenty of choice. Perhaps the most important decision they can make - how it all ends.   


 Where to Find Every Safe Code Location in Robocop: Rogue City 
          

The five safes and their codes can be found at the Arcade, Chop Store, Ghost House, and Steel Mill locations in Robocop: Rogue City. While most of these areas only have one safe to uncover, the Ghost House has two. You may have already visited a few of these places during side quests or main story missions, which could give you an idea about where a safe might be found inside.

Before you go looking for any safe, ensure you have invested skill points in Deduction or Engineering. One of these skills in Robocop: Rogue City must score six or higher to open a safe, regardless of whether you found the code. Try to dedicate your build of Robocop to either one or the other so that you can spend limited upgrades in other useful categories.






Only two Deduction points are needed to read Safe Codes, making this skill the cheaper investment if you want to conserve the biggest number of points.




  Safe Location   Where to Find Safe   Where to Find Code    Arcade   In the final area of the Arcade&#39;s hidden basement, you can find through a button you press in the main building.   On your right, as you enter the basement, on a post-it attached to a board.    Chop Store   Go to one of the main offices in the area to find the safe underneath a desk.   Head all the way to the end of the Store until you reach a set of stairs leading down. Travel into the locker room found below, and you&#39;ll see a post-it with the code inside one of the lockers.    Ghost House   Within the small room with two couches and a single toilet.   Inside the bathroom with the toilet, you&#39;ll find the code attached to one of the cabinets.    In the bedroom of the character Soot, who you encounter during an early story quest.   On the shelf to the right, past where you interrogate Soot.    Steel Mill   Go to a partially destroyed office with a single desk. The safe is right behind the chair in this tiny area.   If you travel to a room directly below the safe, you&#39;ll find the code on a post-it attached to a calendar.   



Once you find all the safes and their codes in Robocop: Rogue City, you&#39;ll be able to score top marks as an officer of Detroit, keeping the city&#39;s crime low by dismantling a part of their network.
