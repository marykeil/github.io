## Literature Review

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous features seven romance options from Pathfinder&#39;s party companions and NPCs, including Camellia, Lann, and Daeran.




Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous allows players to romance some of their party members while battling demons and leading Crusades, but the player character’s gender and story choices influence which party members and NPCs are available to romance. Like most modern RPGs that include romance subplots, Pathfinder&#39;s romance options offer another level of entertainment and replayability outside the main questline. Party members and other companions are often written so vibrantly, players can’t help but fall for them - but whether they fall for the player character is another question entirely.




Just like in real life, each romance option in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous has different tastes, preferences, and personalities. While some may appreciate a firmer, unwavering hero, others may prefer a compassionate warrior. WOTR offers seven characters for players to romance during the main campaign, including six party members and one NPC. Here&#39;s an overview on how romance works in WOTR, and a look at how to make each of the romance options swoon.

                  How to Recruit All Party Companions in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous   Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous pits holy warriors against monsters of the abyss. Players can recruit companions from either side or others as well   


 How Romance Works In Pathfinder: WOTR 
          

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous offers romances for all playstyles, encouraging players to follow their hearts when choosing the fate of Golarion. Each companion and NPC favors their own type of hero, and Pathfinder’s many impactful player choices combine with this to make the game vastly replayable. Characters are romanced (or turned off) by a series of &#34;romance flags,&#34; choices that demonstrate the player character&#39;s suitability as a romantic partner for each individual. However, it&#39;s possible to romance a character but not wind up with them in the end. For that, the player character will have to trigger deeper &#34;true love flags.&#34;






Although it&#39;s possible to romance multiple characters at the beginning of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, near the beginning of Act Five, any remaining romance options demand monogamy. At this point, the player character will have to choose a single partner to pursue a relationship with for the rest of the game.




First and foremost, certain companions prefer characters of certain genders, but even beyond that, there are a wide variety of choices that can help or hurt the chance of romance. The Pathfinder player character&#39;s choice of Mythic Path can impact which NPCs take notice of them, and their dialogue choices will determine who stays interested. The following chart shows every romance option in a player&#39;s party, along with their gender preferences:

 WOTR Romance Option  Gender Preference   Camellia  Male   Lann  Female   Wenduag  Any gender   Daeran  Any gender   Sosiel  Male   Arueshalae  Any gender   Queen Galfrey  Any gender   






A good start to romancing any character is keeping them in the party as much as possible. After all, love takes time, and the more the object of the player character&#39;s affections hangs around, the more time they&#39;ll have to impress them. From there, it&#39;s all about paying attention to their dialogue, determining what they&#39;re looking for, and stepping into that role. While none of them demand perfection, they all have likes and dislikes. Some companions also require completion of certain quests before they&#39;re open to a relationship. Each of these potential romance options in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is detailed in full below.



 Romancing Camellia in WOTR Takes Time, But Is Worth The Effort 
          

Camellia perfectly fits the Ice Queen character archetype, which may be a turn-off for players interested in fresher RPG romance stories. Though she&#39;s downright cold at first, a like-minded and persistent player character can eventually melt her heart. Camellia is one of the first companions that joins the player, making her a more common romance option in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous than characters that join later on, such as Arueshalae. Having her around longer just gives the player character more time to trigger her romance or true love flags.




As a Spirit Hunter Shaman, Camellia prefers the company of spirits to her companions, but can be convinced to spend more time with the player character and become kinder. Camellia also has the Courtier background, having spent much of her life in royal courts as an advisor to Golarion’s most powerful and influential royals. This results in a fair bit of arrogance that keeps her companions at arm’s length. However, it&#39;s easy to impress her by demonstrating a grasp of basic etiquette as a result.

Though Pathfinder’s Camellia may seem like a lost cause, dedicated heroes can find a way to understand her callousness and encourage her to love again. Camellia prefers male characters and will only continue the romance in Wrath of the Righteous if they support her questionable hobbies. During Act 3, the player character may catch Camellia engaged in a murderous ritual. They can either encourage her to continue, or convince her to stop over the remainder of the game, but it&#39;s important to tread lightly. While swaying Camellia away from murder results in an arguably better ending, repeatedly chastising her may eventually draw her ire.






 Romancing Lann in WOTR 
          

Lann embodies the tragic hero romance option in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. Each playable race has advantages and disadvantages, forcing players to adapt to their choice and evolve throughout the story. Lann is a Mongrelman, a member of a race that has a very short lifespan. His wit and charm are enough to woo any hero, but he seeks a heroic death more than romantic connections.

The brevity of Lann’s life encourages him to seek out an honorable end without enjoying what years he has left. Lann is only a romance option in WOTR for female player characters, who can convince him that there’s more to life than a hero&#39;s death. However, they don&#39;t necessarily have to. It&#39;s possible to romance Lann, then let him go out in a blaze of glory as he&#39;s always wanted. It&#39;s not the most satisfying ending, but it may be appropriate for certain player characters.




Lann’s romance is also strained, and vulnerable to sabotage. Lann&#39;s companion quest pits the party against Wenduag, another playable character and romance option. It is possible to recruit both of them, but they frequently butt heads, and are best kept far away from each other. However, if players side with Wenduag in Act Three of WOTR’s story, Lann will leave the party until Act Five. It&#39;s still possible, albeit difficult, to romance him after the fact.

Lann’s status as a Mongrelman provides insight into the injustices and struggles throughout Golarion, extending back to a time before the demons broke through the portal. In his short lifetime, he&#39;s suffered many hardships, but has come out the other side wiser and kinder. In order to keep him alive through the ending, players must reunite Lann with his mother, and help him ascend to chief of his Mongrel clan. His romance in Wrath of the Righteous is one of the most complex and tragic, with the potential for both highs and lows.






 Romancing Wenduag in WOTR Is Ideal For Evil Characters 
          

Playing evil characters in Pathfinder can be an allure to some players, allowing them to explore a lesser-known side of each story with difficult choices and chaotic consequences. For players looking to embrace their darker side, Wenduag is the optimal Pathfinder romance option. Like Lann, Wenduag is a Mongrel that began her life in underground caves. However, she lacks Lann&#39;s heroic streak, and instead pursues strength and power beyond all else.

These preferences lead to Wenduag revealing herself as mercilessly cruel. Players can romance Wenduag regardless of their character’s gender, but their choices and strategies must match her worldview. This means Good- and Neutral-aligned characters may not gain her favor as quickly as Chaotic- or Evil-aligned characters. Wenduag can join the party during the Prologue, but if players recruit Lann instead, she appears in Act Three during Lann’s quest. They can spend some time together immediately, but a longer-lasting romance may take a little more work.




Thankfully, Wenduag is pretty straightforward, so once she&#39;s in the party, it&#39;s easy enough to tell what she wants in a partner. Players will have to fulfill her requests, aiding her people in Drezen whenever she asks. This may mean alienating Lann, although navigating the situation carefully and respecting both characters&#39; wishes does make it possible to recruit both. However, this is a dangerous route: if the player character romances Wenduag without proving themselves worthy of being her true love, she may turn on them in the end.



 Romancing Daeran in WOTR Takes A Little Work 
          

Like Camellia, Daeran Arendae comes from a noble background, and suffers the same arrogance and flippancy that many members of royalty demonstrate towards the sacrifice of the Crusaders during the demonic war. However, compared to other romanceable characters in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, he is unique in that he is an atheist, not choosing to worship any of the gods within WOTR&#39;s pantheon. But despite that, he has a significant connection to the metaphysical: he&#39;s possessed by an ever-rotating coterie of undead spirits called the Other.




Though Daeran possesses a small amount of charm, it’s often overridden by his entitlement and failure to take the calamity seriously. While the nobleman enjoys lavish parties, wicked scandals, and careless whirls, dedicated players can show Daeran what truly matters. They can do this by expressing genuine care and respect for Daeran, but may still have to stroke his ego from time to time.

This nobleman is available to romance for all players, though he prefers Commanders who don’t take things seriously all the time. Certain evil Mystic Paths, like Demon, Lich, and Devil, may prevent players from achieving the best possible ending with Daeran. Freeing Daeran from the Other&#39;s control will help him embrace the possibility of less worldly pleasures. While he urges his leader to enjoy the little things in life while they still can, players can also teach Daeran that it’s okay to care about something other than himself.



 Romancing Sosiel in WOTR Is Rewarding 
          




Sosiel is the archetypal Cleric, a character who encompasses the healing spirit and compassionate mind of these lovely healers. However, the grim realities of war require him to lend his healing powers to the frontline, where he searches high and low for his missing brother Trever. Sosiel values compassion, mercy, and redemption. He gives everyone he meets the benefit of the doubt, and serves excellently as a support character in the Pathfinder party. However, when he finally finds Trever, he discovers that forgiveness doesn&#39;t always come so easily.

A dedicated servant to Shelyn, the Goddess of Love, Beauty, and Art, Sosiel began assisting in the war effort to help others preserve their humanity in the face of the demonic hordes. Though Sosiel sees beauty in everyone, he is only interested in a relationship with men. Pathfinder character builds of any alignment can pursue a connection with this Cleric and become his dark, forbidden love or charming heroic partner.

Sosiel first appears when players become the Commander of Crusaders and is immediately recruitable into the party at the Crusaders Camp. Sosiel is Pathfinder’s softest romantic partner, struggling to keep his heart pure and his faith intact as war rages on. Achieving the best ending requires convincing Sosiel to see Trever in a different light, extending his usual compassion to his estranged brother. While Sosiel’s duty as one of Pathfinder&#39;s best healers often takes priority, romancing him allows players to defend him with the same passion he shows others, resulting in heartwarming interactions and connections.






 Romancing Arueshalae in WOTR Is Easy For All Playstyles 
         

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous features many playable races and backstories to ensure no two characters are alike. Arueshalae proves the formula is working, making a brilliant addition to the player’s party in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.

Arueshalae is a succubus who defies her demonic nature, and seeks to redeem herself from her base instincts. She arrives later in the campaign during Act Two, where players can locate her in the Drezen Prison during the Siege of Drezen. Arueshalae is one of the more straightforward romances among Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&#39; companions, allowing players to flirt with her from their first conversation.

Players should avoid pursuing a physical relationship for as long as possible to help defy her succubus nature and assist in her redemption arc. Emotional connections with Arueshalae are far more critical than physical relations, especially considering succubus kisses can be deadly to their recipients. There are no restrictions to what alignment or gender Arueshalae prefers. She is open to relationships with player characters of all types, making her one of the most accepting romances in the game.




It is possible to corrupt Arueshalae instead, encouraging her to embrace her status as a succubus. However, this will result in her leaving the party, taking everything in her inventory with her. While she can be re-recruited later, letting her go down this path might restrict the player&#39;s access to a good ending with Arueshalae. As a result, it&#39;s best to steer her away from her dangerous tendencies in order to ensure the best outcome.



 Romancing Queen Galfrey in WOTR Is Necessary To Recruit Her 
          

Queen Galfrey is the only Wrath of the Righteous romance option (normally) unavailable for recruitment into a Pathfinder player’s party. As her name suggests, she is the current monarch of Mendev, and responsible for the war effort against the demonic invasion. Her many Crusades have brought about countless victories, molding her into the symbol of hope the people need to resist the demonic overlords.




However, the war&#39;s mounting casualties weigh heavily on her, leaving Galfrey alone under the pressure of leading a country and army. Players can romance her by following a Good or Non-Chaotic Mystic Path during gameplay, earning her respect and attraction. She is attracted to male and female character types alike, and can even join the party after a successful romance.

To coerce Queen Galfrey to join the party, players must venture to Threshold after a successful courtship and speak to her, thereby recruiting a powerful force into their adventuring crew. Unfortunately, players drawn to Chaotic Alignments in Pathfinder may be scorned and turned away by the warrior Queen.

Romance is as complicated in Pathfinder as it is in real life. Adjusting to each character&#39;s unique preferences, requests, and personalities may be difficult, but most players will latch onto one or two characters early on and pursue them throughout the game. Since they can&#39;t explore every romance subplot in a single playthrough, the rest will have to wait until their next run. In the end, the key to a happy love life in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is to pay attention, choose wisely, and be patient.




              Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous  In this isometric RPG, the player takes on the role of the Commander, fighting a war against a portal called the Worldwound through which demons invade.
