## Literature Review

With the huge scale of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, one of the game&#39;s best and most important NPCs can be unfortunately easy to overlook.




Similar to other large-scale RPGs, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has a number of characters and locations that it can be easy to miss some — especially when one is locked out by certain decisions, like the githyanki Orpheus. With the many possible ways that players might progress through Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, it might be easy to miss many of the game&#39;s best moments and characters, which can bleed over to other quests and even the overall ending of the entire game.

While Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers plenty in the way of player freedom, a consequence of that freedom is that certain parts of the game can inadvertently be missed or skipped over — not helped by the game being somewhat unclear about points of no return and locked-off content in some cases. Those looking to move onto Act 2, for example, will often get the impression that journeying to the mountain pass area locks off the opportunity to go through the Underdark, and serves as a point of no return for the first act. This can lead to some players missing out on large chunks of story, especially those pertaining to Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s githyanki crèche.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   





 Orpheus Is One Of BG3&#39;s Most Important Characters 
         

Surprisingly, one of the easiest characters to &#34;miss&#34; in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is also one of the more important figures in its plot — the githyanki prince Orpheus. The rightful ruler of the githyanki who was overthrown and imprisoned by the Lich Queen Vlaakith, Orpheus spends most of BG3 imprisoned within the Astral Prism, which players will only become aware of towards the end of the githyanki crèche storyline, or near the start of the third act. Boasting massive psionic powers, Orpheus is (through The Emperor) the one providing the party with protection from the influence of the Absolute throughout the story.



 Orpheus Can Be Easily Missed In BG3 
          




However, despite his general importance to the plot, and the storyline of the githyanki, players can somewhat easily miss out on the chance to free Orpheus in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, a choice which can potentially come up towards the end of the game. Getting the opportunity to make this choice, however, requires a few different quests to come together in certain ways. Going through the mountain pass and progressing Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest to the point that she either breaks away from or swears her allegiance to Vlaakith is one important step, and likewise, players need to make sure they don&#39;t miss meeting with Raphael at Sharess&#39;s Caress in the third act.

Once those conditions have been met, players should receive the quest to free Orpheus, which requires them to get the Orphic Hammer in Raphael&#39;s possession, either through making a deal with him or breaking into the House of Hope and stealing it. Then, towards the very end of the game, after the Emperor has drawn the party back into the Astral Prism following a failed confrontation with the Netherbrain, the game will present a difficult choice - whether to stick with the assistance of the Emperor, or free Orpheus with the use of the Orphic Hammer.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Should You Free Orpheus In BG3 Or Side With The Emperor?   One of the many choices faced in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 involves freeing Orpheus or siding with the Emperor in Act 3, and then living with the consequences.   

Unfortunately, the option to free Orpheus can be somewhat easy to miss out on for some players — with how large the third act is, first-time playthroughs can end up missing out on the quest to get the Orphic Hammer, especially for those who might have skipped over the mountain pass in the second act. For players who go through the effort of getting the hammer, though, choosing to free Orpheus can offer some significantly different and interesting outcomes for the final battle and the end of the game, especially when it comes to the ending of Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest.



 Freeing Orpheus Has Interesting Outcomes For Lae&#39;zel And The Githyanki 
          




Although he isn&#39;t fully introduced until the later parts of the game, Orpheus is an important character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, being hugely relevant in Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest and an entirely new edition to the backstory of the githyanki as a whole. Being the son of Gith, Orpheus is the rightful ruler of the githyanki, who fought a war against the Lich Queen Vlaakith and lost, leading to his imprisonment in the Astral Prism. Discovering his backstory throughout the first two acts of the game requires finding three githyanki discs, which add an interesting twist for those already familiar with the lore of githyanki from other DnD media.

As a late-game alternative to the Emperor, Orpheus can also come off as significantly more trustworthy — compared to the mind flayer, Orpheus is less manipulative and ambiguous in his motivations, dropping any potential hostilities with the party to oppose the Netherbrain, even going so far as to accept turning into a mind flayer to help fight it. Additionally, freeing him leads to interesting story developments for the githyanki as a whole, as it kicks off a rebellion against Vlaakith after the final battle, and a potential reconciliation between the githyanki and another faction, the githzerai.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Pros &amp; Cons Of Romancing Lae&#39;zel In BG3   Maintaining a true emotional connection with the githyanki warrior might be harder than one would think, but the payoff is totally worth it.    

Largely, though, Orpheus is notable for his influence on the storyline of Lae&#39;zel — whereas she starts off strictly adherent to Vlaakith, the influence of Orpheus&#39;s story, discovered throughout the game, as well as the events that take place in the githyanki créche, contribute interesting developments to Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest. Towards the end of the second act or beginning of the third, Lae&#39;zel can have her faith in Vlaakith shaken, leading her to eventually look towards freeing Orpheus. Following her personal quests to its end leads towards one of her most optimistic endings, where she either fights alongside Orpheus&#39;s rebellion or, in the event that he is turned into a mind flayer, even leads it herself.



If Lae&#39;zel instead swears allegiance to Vlaakith, she&#39;ll still want to free Orpheus — to assassinate him.







Despite Orpheus&#39;s status as one of the most important characters in BG3, and as one of the wholly new important lore figures added by the game, the opportunity to engage with him as more than a simple plot device can be surprisingly easy to miss. For players who might&#39;ve missed him on a first pass, following his questlines to their conclusion can lead to some of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s most interesting story moments.
