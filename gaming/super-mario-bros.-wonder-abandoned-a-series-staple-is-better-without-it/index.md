# Super Mario Bros. Wonder Abandoned A Series Staple (&amp; Is Better Without It)


## SUMMARY 



  Super Mario Bros. Wonder breaks tradition by removing the timer, allowing players to take their time in standard levels and prioritize exploration and discovery.   The removal of the timer allows for more experimentation in level design and introduces new mechanics like Wonder Flowers that add variety and challenge to the gameplay.   The absence of a timer enhances the multiplayer experience, fostering a sense of community and allowing for spontaneous interactions between players in levels.

## Literature Review

Super Mario Bros. has used a winning formula for decades, but that doesn&#39;t mean that change is never called for, and one big shift is for the best.




Super Mario Bros. Wonder builds on the classic legacy of 2D Mario platformers, but it also takes risks and shakes things up in ways that help set the game apart from all of its predecessors. Altering formulas that have proven effective for decades can be a daunting move, but the New Super Mario Bros. games were starting to lose their luster with minimal change from each installment to the next. Going back to the drawing board helped make Super Mario Bros. Wonder a more exciting game than other recent 2D entries, and one element that helped make that possible abandoned a feature that&#39;s always been integral to the series.




Like many games from the 1980s, the original Super Mario Bros. reflects many elements of arcade design philosophy, even though it was always meant to be played on the Nintendo Entertainment System at home. There was never any need to worry about quarter munching, as a purchase of the cartridge would obviously make it playable forever, but limited lives and a lack of save files encouraged mastery over what would otherwise be a reasonably short game. One aspect of the challenge actually encouraged rushing, however, as the time limit applied to each level meant that loitering around would cost a player dearly.

                  Super Mario Bros. Wonder Review: &#34;Mario&#39;s Most Magical Adventure&#34;   Super Mario Bros. Wonder releases on Nintendo Switch this month, and for players young and old it&#39;s nothing but a delightful experience.   


 Super Mario Bros. Wonder Doesn&#39;t Have A Timer 
          




One of the biggest traditions that Super Mario Bros. Wonder bucks is the timer, which persisted across generations as a staple element of the Super Mario Bros. challenge. Although the countdown was never intense enough to make things feel like a race, it stuck around as a basic incentive to forward momentum, ensuring that levels designed around consistent progress never lose that aspect. Super Mario Bros. Wonder maintains the system in certain challenge levels that are oriented around completing specific goals within a time frame, but the standard levels that simply prioritize getting to the flag at the end mostly let players take as much time as they need.



One interesting thing to spend time looking for is entrance locations to the Special World, the most challenging area to be found in Super Mario Bros. Wonder.




After all this time, this change might feel like it interferes with a well-tuned system, and it&#39;s easy to accuse Nintendo of simply removing friction points to make the experience easier for everyone. It&#39;s certainly been a long time since the Super Mario Bros. games attempted to replicate the difficulty of something like Super Mario Bros. 3 (or The Lost Levels, for the daring), and the importance of conserving lives across levels has been significantly toned down. There&#39;s ultimately a lot more to the removal of timers than just a difficulty adjustment, however, and it might actually be one of the reasons why Super Mario Bros. Wonder is great.




                  One Super Mario Bros. Wonder Character Could’ve Ruined The Game   The Flower Kingdom prince featured in Super Mario Bros. Wonder was not the first such character in Mario’s history, which made some fans concerned.   



 Removing The Timer Lets Super Mario Bros. Experiment 
         

Although getting to the end of a level obviously remains the primary goal in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it&#39;s arguably not quite as central as in prior titles. Like some of the more innovative Super Mario Maker levels, Super Mario Bros. Wonder focuses on shaking up the journey, using concepts like Wonder Flowers to throw wrenches into the works. 3D Mario titles like Super Mario 64 and Odyssey show how much fun there is to be had in letting Mario discover diverse experiences while following an overall scheme of progress, and bringing more of that philosophy into the 2D space benefits from losing the urgency of a timer.




Wonder Flowers are also a good example of how the game can keep up the pace when the situation calls for it. Some use auto-scroll as a threat, while others make use of a chase or an environmental threat to push the plumber or other Super Mario Bros. Wonder playable characters forward. Other mechanics like Bulrush stampedes achieve similar effects without the use of a Wonder Flower, building on the Mario legacy of occasionally featuring levels that are more frantic than the rest. All of these techniques feel like a more deeply integrated way to demand haste than slapping on a countdown, with the world itself demanding that Mario move.

This philosophy particularly shines when the online multiplayer features of Super Mario Bros. Wonder are enabled, which bring the phantoms of other players into levels to experience them simultaneously. Without a hard incentive to rush to the end of a level, spontaneous interactions can become significantly more varied. Whether mutually attempting random challenges or simply spamming emotes in unison, there&#39;s a sense of community that makes playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder without a friend feel less lonely than any preceding game in the franchise.






 Super Mario Bros. Wonder Improves The Series&#39; Difficulty 
          

Removing the timer ultimately doesn&#39;t do anything as simple as making the game easier than prior Super Mario Bros. titles, but instead helps even out the playing field to focus more on discrete challenges. Very young children can take advantage of the change to spend as much time as necessary getting through levels, while the weirder mechanics and challenge levels provide a more daunting challenge than anything in the New Super Mario Bros. games. It leans toward a model of organically selective difficulty that&#39;s more similar to the 3D games, and ultimately helps accessibility by lowering the barrier to entry while actually allowing greater difficulty for those who seek it.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a unique experiment for the Super Mario Bros. series, and any changes that it makes to the formula might not end up sticking around in the long run. If any should, however, the removal of the timer is one that could get a lot more mileage without wearing out its welcome. A level coming down to the wire could be an infrequent thrill in past Mario games, but the mechanic was rarely of significant relevance and provided a mild restriction to level design. Super Mario Bros. Wonder asks players to stop and smell the Wonder Flowers, and the game is ultimately better for it.
