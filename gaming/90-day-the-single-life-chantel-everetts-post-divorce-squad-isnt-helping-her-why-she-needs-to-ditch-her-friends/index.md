## Literature Review

Chantel Everett’s friends seem more interested in having fun on 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 rather than finding a suitable match for her.




Chantel Everett from 90 Day: The Single Life has done herself a huge disservice by allowing her friends to ruin her post-divorce healing journey. The 32-year-old Georgia native was once in a very happy relationship with her Dominican Republic partner, Pedro Jimeno. She loved him a lot and wanted to build a future with him. Unfortunately, things changed when Chantel got her own show, The Family Chantel, and they began airing more of her personal life on TV. She let her family interfere in her husband’s life and indirectly caused more feuds and drama.




Pedro began drifting apart from Chantel as he grew tired of the family issues after the COVID-19 pandemic. He started focusing more on his new real estate career and stopped caring for Chantel’s feelings. In 2022, Pedro finally asked Chantel for a divorce, ultimately breaking her heart. Chantel accepted this but still mourned the loss of her seven-year relationship. The couple settled their divorce and financial matters in The Family Chantel season 5. Soon after, Chantel returned to reality TV, hoping to find someone better than Pedro.

 Chantel Everett’s Friends Are Looking For Fun &amp; Attention 

 




Chantel has joined 90 Day: The Single Life to showcase her post-divorce journey. Unfortunately, she has brought her friends on the show, who seemingly lack sensibility and maturity. Recently, The Single Life showed Chantel’s ride with her three friends, and felt repulsed by how they lacked empathy for her following her divorce. The trio got celebratory divorce cups, along with cringe-worthy motivational quotes. A social media user commented on the scene (via 90dayfiance), “she isn’t gonna find a man with those friends around.” Another user wrote, “all her friends are a recipe for disaster,” adding that Chantel may end up single if she remains close with this group.



 Chantel Everett’s Friends Are Steering Her In Wrong Direction 
          

Chantel’s post-divorce squad includes her childhood friend, hairdresser, and twerk instructor. While these three individuals may be great at their jobs, they aren’t great at helping her heal. Chantel’s childhood friend has brought unnecessary things to make Chantel feel better. One of the segments showed her pulling out a quote that read, “he’s someone else’s headache now.” She is acting like Chantel’s divorce is something to celebrate instead of understanding the reality of the situation. While the hairdresser lacks sensitivity, the twerk instructor is completely out of the line for hitting on men Chantel is trying to get to know.






 Chantel Everett’s Segment With Her Friend Looks Scripted &amp; Cringey 
          

Chantel’s friends look incredibly fake and cringeworthy. Neither of them seems to grasp what Chantel is going through. Instead, they’re all there to have fun and seek attention. If Chantel wants a fair chance at finding someone worthwhile, she must ditch her supposed friends and walk this road alone. Chantel needs to heal before rushing into romance or having a casual fling. Chantel spent the majority of her adult life with Pedro. She needs time to re-evaluate her life, rediscover what she likes, and focus on herself. It would’ve been better for Chantel if she hadn’t joined 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
