# One Baldur s Gate 3 Build Lets You Become Practically Invincible


## SUMMARY 



  In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, having a high Armor Class (AC) can make the protagonist nearly invincible, as fewer attacks will land on them.   Melee weapon users should focus more on improving their AC compared to spellcasters, as armor can interfere with spellcasting.   One BG3 player managed to get their AC up to 31, making them practically invulverable to most attacks.

## Literature Review

In BG3, taking fewer hits is always better, especially with the permadeath of Honour Mode. But this build keeps Tav from taking almost any damage.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 allows Tav – the default name for a custom protagonist – and their companions to gear up and prepare for battle in a variety of different ways. Because BG3 is based on the systems in Dungeons and Dragons, it uses Armor Class as a way to decide if an attack hits the targeted character. As a result, having a higher AC means that fewer attacks will land, and careful character building can result in a near-invincible Tav.




The class that Tav uses can affect their Armor Class, along with items, feats, and the armor type they wear. Generally, melee weapon users will want to focus on improving their AC more than spellcasters, since support roles ideally won&#39;t need the protection, and armor can interfere with spellcasting anyway. Managing to achieve an incredibly high AC in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will make characters nearly untouchable, with the only vulnerabilities being critical hits (which always hit, regardless of the target&#39;s AC) and missed saving throws.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.

Reddit user Yervax (via GamesRadar) focused on building up their Armor Class, and managed to get to a point where they&#39;re nearly invincible against enemies thanks to an astounding 31 AC. Most of Yervax&#39;s AC comes from the items they have equipped, but they also make use of their Dexterity Stat to get a few extra points added. They do this by picking up the Armor of Agility in Act 3, which adds to Tav&#39;s AC based on their Dexterity Stat, giving them a maximum of &#43;5 with Dexterity being at 20. Then, they&#39;re using the shield from Hope in House of Hope, which is a straight &#43;4 to AC. In addition, Yervax has equipped the Ring of Protection, Cloak of Protection, Evasive Shoes, and Warding Bond, each of which give a &#43;1 to AC. Finally, Troubadour&#39;s Wonder from being a Bard adds a final &#43;1 to AC.



 The Effects Of A High AC In BG3 
          




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 treats characters with a high AC uniquely – with an AC of 31, Yervax&#39;s Tav won&#39;t be targeted by the enemy AI until they&#39;re the last party member alive. This helps them live longer by default, since they can&#39;t be hit, and enemies don&#39;t want to hit them if other options are available, too. However, this build would be perfect for avoiding permadeath in BG3&#39;s Honour Mode, as an invincible Tav could hold scrolls to revive other party members, and use the Help Action or throw potions at companions to bring them back into the fight.

                  Neil Newbon On Being &#34;Incredibly Blessed By Astarion&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Neil Newbon discusses playing companion Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, helping direct his fellow actors, and the game&#39;s incredible possibilities.   

While it might start as a joke or a personal challenge to see how high Tav&#39;s AC can get, there are practical benefits to having 31 AC. It&#39;s a huge bonus when trying to make it through Honour Mode, where one total party kill means the run is over. However, most of the items that Yervax used can&#39;t be obtained until late into Act 2 or during Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, so while such a high Armor Class is impressive, it&#39;s not the most practical set-up for many parties.
