## Literature Review

House Flipper 2 has the same premise as the first, but builds upon it with all new features, story, and a creative Sandbox Mode to build from scratch.




House Flipper 2 is launching on PC soon, with console releases coming next March, but with all the DLCs and content that the first House Flipper game already has, it has some heavy competition. The first title was released in 2018, which means that the technology used to support the game has increased substantially and opened up more possibilities for improving it. Even beyond simple changes in graphics and tool systems, however, the developers have taken the feedback and knowledge that they have gained over the past five years to create a sequel that truly stands apart from its predecessor.
House Flipper 2 will be released on Steam on December 14, 2023, and console editions of the game will follow on March 21, 2024. Like the original, the game allows players to clean, paint, repair, decorate, and sell run-down houses and fulfill job contracts for people wanting them to come and fix up individual rooms or areas. With the sequel, developers were able to improve the game&#39;s graphics and technical capabilities while adding more features and even an entirely new game mode to give more variety and options to how to play.
            
 
 &#34;Built Better Than The Original&#34; - House Flipper 2 Review 
The sequel to the 2018 House Flipping game is here and House Flipper 2 builds and improves on the original in many ways.












 








 10  Graphical And Mechanical Improvements 
House Flipper 2 Looks Smoother And More Polished
        

Understandably, after five years, the graphics quality has improved for House Flipper 2 from the first game. The level of detail and smoothness of the environment look much more pleasing to the eye, making for a more immersive experience overall, despite a departure from trying to be as photorealistic as possible in the first game. With House Flipper 2, the graphic design is a bit more of a softer feel that is still quite realistic but with a more cheerful and bright appearance. In a game where players focus so heavily on the objects and area around them, the graphics make a very big difference in the overall enjoyment.





 9  Assembly Minigame And Perks System Revamped 
Unlock Discounts In The Store
        

Perks are not a new feature to House Flipper 2, as they played a large role in the story for the first game as well. However, in this sequel, the perks system is revamped for better progression in the game. The more certain skills are used, the more perk points will be gained for that type of activity. Additionally, little minigames for assembling furniture or repairing broken objects will also unlock discounts at the store for those products, if completed successfully.





 8  New House Flipper Story Mode Campaign 
Tom Can Share All The Local Gossip
        

As would be expected, a new game brings a new story mode campaign full of residents needing help with their homes in a beautiful seaside location. The main character&#39;s NPC friend, Tom, is happy to share lots of knowledge and gossip about everyone in the neighborhood and information about the houses. In the story mode, the Flippers will need to start with small jobs while they build up their reputation and bank account to be able to eventually take on the bigger projects.

The profession simulator game House Flipper allows players to extensively customize houses, but the game&#39;s camera isn&#39;t quite as free of restrictions.








 7  Flip Houses In The Seaside Forest Location Of Pinnacove 
Beautiful Scenery With Woods And Ocean


 







A new story mode and the entire game of House Flipper 2 takes place in a lush and beautiful area called Pinnacove. The updated graphics qualities for the sequel are put into full effect with the verdant terrain of the forest surroundings and the sandy beaches at the water&#39;s edge of Crayfish Coast. Pinnacove is said to be a small fishing village turned tourist destination and includes three different biomes of suburban, coastal, and forest for now. Developers have announced that post-release there are plans to add three more regions to the game as well.





 6  Grid Placement And Furniture Snapping Systems Are Improved 
More Precise Placements
        

Improvements deep within the workings of the game make it so that in House Flipper 2, there will be much better mechanics for placing items and furniture exactly where the Flipper wants them to go. This will be particularly useful in the new Sandbox mode, but also a noticeable improvement in basic gameplay. The new grid system depends on the size of the item for snapping into certain places, but the grid can also be turned off so that objects can be anywhere. Even the very heights of the floors can be adjusted to however tall the Flipper would like the ceilings to go to design the room or house of their dreams.





 5  Stack Items, Fill The Fridge, And More In Flipped Or New Houses 
Better Immersion Through Decorating With Objects
        

Adding onto this new system of placing items wherever the player would like them to go, House Flipper 2 will allow for many more of the small details that can make a house a home. Stacking books on a shelf, filling the fridge with food, or even hanging toilet paper can be achieved in the sequel to create more of a realistic and pleasing feeling that becomes somewhat like the game Unpacking if that is what a player would like to focus on. Putting clothes on hangers may not seem like a necessary concept in a house flipping simulator, but it adds to the immersive quality and will make a finished flip feel more complete.
            
 
 Games That Expand On The Sims 4â€™s Features 
There are quite a few games out there for fans of just about every feature from The Sims 4. Here are a few notably similar titles to look into.








 4  Greatly Improved Tool Mechanics 
Flipper Tool Can Even Clone Items


 







The tools in House Flipper get a lot of use, whether that is cleaning supplies, paint rollers, or the Flipper Tool gun that was used to sell items. For the sequel, each tool was improved, allowing the paint roller to be larger, items to work in diagonal directions, and more. The Flipper Tool was also given new abilities to clone items with all the customizations that players already set on one object, saving time and improving the basic quality-of-life mechanic in the game.





 3  Basements And Bunkers Are Available 
New Terrain Sculpting Tool Can Dig Deep
        

In House Flipper 2, there is a new option to change the height of any point on the map. Hills can be lifted from the ground to offer a new dimension to the landscape or build entrances to underground units. A new tool called Land Holes will then be able to build a hole in the land to go underground, allowing for the construction of bunkers, tunnels, and basements.





 2  Sandbox Mode Allows Players To Create Levels To Share With Others

A brand-new Sandbox Mode has been created for House Flipper 2 that allows players to use level-creation tools to design houses that can be shared with an easy-to-use mod.io system, including creating other jobs for players to complete in these houses. For this, the Sandbox has unique tools such as a Trash Generator to make areas filthy for others to clean and many landscaping tools. Players will likely be creating many hidden secrets that others will run across within the walls of these unique levels, and the system encourages creativity.





 1  Build Houses From Scratch In Sandbox Mode 
Design A House From The Ground Up


 







House Flipper 2 developers listened to the community feedback from many who wished they could not just fix up and flip a home, but create one from the ground up. Now, in the Sandbox Mode, players will be able to take an empty lot and craft the terrain as well as build their own homes with additional features that are not found in the Flipper Mode. With all the tools at their disposal, players can enjoy House Flipper 2 in whichever way they want, whether that is cleaning and flipping pre-made homes, or building from scratch.
