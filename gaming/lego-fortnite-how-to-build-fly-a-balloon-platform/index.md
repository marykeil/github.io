## Literature Review

Balloon Platforms are perfect for traveling vast distances in LEGO Fortnite. However, they can be hard to build and require lots of resources.





While playing LEGO Fortnite, your goal is to create a thriving settlement out in the wilderness, recruiting and welcoming new Villagers, searching for rare resources and defending everything you’ve built from hostile monsters. Building and flying your own Balloon Platform gives you extra flexibility, allowing you to survey the lands from above and transport loot and items between settlements in safety.

Luckily for players, the game provides some basic items to help novice balloon flyers get started. This includes the Dynamic Platform, which serves as a good base for your hot air balloons and flying vehicles. A single Dynamic Platform costs 4 Flexwood, a mid-game resource that you can get from cutting down Cactus in LEGO Fortnite.

          

You can start off with one Dynamic Platform or attach more than one Platform to basic Foundation blocks, which only cost 1 or 2 Wood depending on their size. If you want a bigger Balloon Platform, it’s generally recommended that you use Foundation blocks. However, smaller Balloon Platforms work just fine if your main goal is just to survey distant areas.




          

To get your Balloon Platform in the air, you will need to craft and attach some Balloons. To craft Balloons, you’ll need Silk and access to the Spinning Wheel and Loom workbenches, which require rare resources such as Sand Claws to build. These workbenches allow you to craft Silk Fabric, an essential crafting component for Balloons.



You can craft Small Balloons and Large Balloons, which have different lifting power. The heavier your Balloon Platform, the more Balloons you’ll need to get off the ground.




          




With Balloons, you will be able to get your Balloon Platform in the air. However, flying requires additional components.

To get moving, you will need Thrusters and Activation Switches:

 Item  Resources Needed   Small Thruster    1 Wooden Rod   1 Blast Powder   1 Torch      Large Thruster    3 Wooden Rods   2 Blast Powder   1 Torch      Activation Switch    1 Wood   1 Blast Powder      



The basic idea is to attach Small or Large Thrusters to the sides of your Balloon Platform and use an Activation Switch to toggle them on and off.



You can also attach Wheels to the sides of your Balloon Platform. These absorb some of the impact from landing, allowing you to make softer landings.







Unfortunately, steering is much more complicated. As of writing, LEGO Fortnite doesn’t feature a steering wheel or flight stick component, so you’ll need to get creative. Following a basic flying machine design by Reddit user u/Inevitable-Hold7875 is a great first step, allowing you to build a flying machine that you can also steer.


 

The key to this build is attaching Thrusters that allow you to change direction on the move. However, this is harder than it initially appears as Activation Switches will activate all attached components unless placed in specific locations on your flying machine.

Balloon Platforms and flying machines are incredibly useful, allowing you to quickly travel vast distances over challenging terrain, and transport cargo and items. If you’re willing to spend the time crafting the right components, you’ll find they’re among the best vehicles in LEGO Fortnite.
