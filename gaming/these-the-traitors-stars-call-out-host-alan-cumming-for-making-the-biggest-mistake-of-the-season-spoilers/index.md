Summary

  Host Alan Cumming made a mistake in choosing the traitor team, according to Johnny, Larsa, and Marcus.   The initial traitors chosen were Dan Gheesling and Phaedra Parks, who later recruited Parvati Shallow.   The cast may be unhappy with the traitors&#39; gameplay, but they should respect the strategic aspect.  







The Traitors US season 2 kicked off with the exciting reveal of the identities of the traitors as selected by host Alan Cumming, but some of the cast believed the host made a major mistake. As the season got started, the first three episodes dropped and revealed the trajectory of the game as traitors were given the opportunity to add a member to their team via recruitment immediately upon being chosen. After the traitors were chosen, the rest of the cast had to adjust to their roles as faithful and begin the hunt to try and figure out who amongst them were the traitors.

In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant, Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, Larsa Pippen, and Marcus Jordan agreed that Alan made a mistake in choosing the traitor team. “Alan should’ve did a better job recruiting the traitors,” Larsa shared, “I don’t think their team was all good.” Johnny agreed, elaborating, “could [he] have at least picked one person with an iota of a personality or entertainment [value]? I think if they had at least picked one traitor that had entertainment value, they wouldn’t have been so quick to murder [me].” Marcus, who appeared with Larsa in the interview, agreed with the sentiments.

 Who Are The Traitors On The Traitors US Season 2? 
          

The Traitors US season 2 had some strong contenders to play the game as traitors with a cast full of reality TV royalty. While there were options from both the competitive reality TV side of things and the docuseries-style reality TV realm, Alan had a large crop of people to pick through for the role of traitor. Ultimately, after conducting interviews with the majority of the cast, Alan was able to narrow his choice down to two initial traitors who would then decide their third team member on their own. After much deliberation, Alan decided the initial traitors would be Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling and Married To Medicine’s Phaedra Parks.





 

After meeting for the first time in the traitors’ turret, the duo discussed their options for recruitment. As Dan had more experience with strategic players than Phaedra, she deferred to his instruction on who would be good to choose. Dan discussed a few options, including his former Big Brother co-star Janelle Pierzina and Survivor legend Sandra Diaz-Twine, but ultimately felt that they would be too closely associated with him to choose. By the night&#39;s end, the devious duo chose Survivor winner Parvati Shallow as their final team member for The Traitors US season 2.

While Alan’s picks for the initial traitors may have included two strategic players, it’s unclear from the first three episodes of the series if he actually made a mistake in his choice for the traitors. Johnny, Larsa, and Marcus may be unhappy with the way the traitors played the game or the fact that, at least Johnny and Marcus, were taken out within the first three episodes. Despite knowing that the traitors were able to get two of the three players out, The Traitors US season 2 cast should be able to respect the strategic gameplay.
