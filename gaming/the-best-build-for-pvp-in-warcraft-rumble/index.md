## Literature Review

PvP is one of the most difficult aspects of Warcraft Rumble, and you&#39;ll quickly become discouraged if you don&#39;t use the best PvP builds in the game.





Before entering the chaotic world of online PvP in Warcraft Rumble, you must first collect numerous minis, level them, and increase their rarity. That way, your minis can benefit from using their Talents in battle, which is necessary if you wish to succeed in PvP. So, regardless of how far along you&#39;re in the game, knowing how to level up fast will help you collect more minis and make them stronger, resulting in a better PvP deck overall.

 Best PvP Deck Builds In Warcraft Rumble 
          

When creating a PvP deck for Warcraft Rumble, the two most important factors are your average gold and damage. Generally, the less gold you have and the greater average damage you deal, the better. Of course, some decks work to counter this meta directly, though they are only sometimes effective.



There are several ways to build a great PvP deck around the three leaders listed below. So, it&#39;s recommended that you experiment with new synergies between minis and their Talent until you find a build that&#39;s perfect for you.




Baron Rivendare PvP Deck
 Mini  Talent   Baron Rivendare (Leader)  Chill of the Grave   Skeleton Party  5-Man   Necromancer  Breath of the Dying   Skeletons  Questing Buddies   S.A.F.E. Pilot  Gnomish Cloaking Device   Harpies  Talon Dive   Blizzard  Brittle Ice   






  Avg. Gold - 3.4   Avg. Damage - 156.5   Avg. Health - 366.7   Avg. DPS - 106  

Regarding PvP in Warcraft Rumble, Baron Rivendare is one of the strongest leaders in the game. He generally excels at maintaining map control and collecting gold mines and chests. With this build, you&#39;re essentially creating a pesky army around him with the Necromancer and Skeletons, which can either protect your leader or work to pull the enemy away from him.

Finally, the Brittle Ice Talent for Blizzard makes enemies within deal 30% more physical damage. As a result, if you use it when you have a lot of melee-based minis on the field, such as your Skeletons, the combination can completely wipe out your opponent&#39;s wave and win you the game.

Rend Blackhand PvP Deck
 Mini  Talent   Rend Blackhand (Leader)  Scale and Steel   Gryphon Rider  Mighty Throw   Quilboar  Tunnel Vision   Earth Elemental  Obsidian Shard   Harpies  Infectious Swipes   S.A.F.E. Pilot  Gnomish Cloaking Device   Drake  Mother Drake   






  Avg. Gold - 3.3   Avg. Damage - 234   Avg. Health - 590   Avg. DPS - 108  

What makes this one of the best builds for PvP in Warcraft Rumble is that it fully utilizes Rend Blackhand&#39;s leader ability, Blacken The Skies, which reduces the cost of other flying troops by one gold while Rend is in play. As a result, when this ability is active, it is an excellent time to deploy your other flying-based minis, particularly the Drake, which synergizes so well with Rend Blackhand. Even with your opponent having a lot of air offense, this build can quickly catch players off guard.​​​​​​​

Tirion Fordring PvP Deck
 Mini  Talent   Tirion Fordring (Leader)  By the Light   Blizzard  Cold Snap   Footmen  Fortification   Core Hounds  Eternal Bond   Gryphon Rider  Odyn&#39;s Fury   Frostwolf Shaman  Earthwall Totem   Murloc Tidehunters  Safety Bubble   






  Avg. Gold - 3.9   Avg. Damage - 167   Avg. Health - 521   Avg. DPS - 76  

Tirion Fordring is also a contender for one of the game&#39;s best leaders, thanks to his ability to heal other units. You also have the Frostwolf Shaman in this deck, who, while not as effective, serves as an excellent secondary healer. As a result, this build focuses on combining units with a healer to make a strong push. All you need is to win one engagement in a single lane. Once you do, prioritize that lane, and with the help of Fordring&#39;s healing ability, you can snowball your way to victory in Warcraft Rumble.
