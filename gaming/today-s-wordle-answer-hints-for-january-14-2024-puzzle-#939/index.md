## Literature Review

The new Sunday Wordle is available to solve and we&#39;ve got a few hints, and the fully spoiled answer, for those that need a little help.





There is always a chance that you could slip up though and get stuck in an endless loop of guesses until you run out of the standard six. This can be avoided best by turning on Wordle&#39;s Hard Mode, with this enacted you won&#39;t be able to just randomly throw out guesses unless they line up with previously given hints. This is a great way to lower the amount of tries it takes to solve a Wordle puzzle, but it does require a bit more brain power.

The January 14th Wordle answer is DOING.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE, this only provided a single letter &#39;I&#39; in the wrong position. Moving forward we tried to adjust the &#39;I&#39; and went with SLING. This provided the letters &#39;ING&#39; in the correct position.

This could be a death sentence as tons of five-letter words ending in &#39;ING&#39;, but we prevailed successfully despite that. Our final guess gave us a solid Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, DOING.
