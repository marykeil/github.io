## Literature Review

Properly build Hanya in Honkai: Star Rail and unlock the potential of a support unit who is perfect for hypercarry teams focused on maximum damage.





Because of her alignment with Harmony, Hanya’s main focus in battles is to provide support for the rest of her team – most of which stem from buffs. She can increase the SPD and ATK of party members, which makes them more effective in fights. However, the character is also capable of applying debuffs on opponents, which will increase the DMG they take from the rest of the team. Hanya can also help with Skill Point restoration, which makes her valuable when paired up with characters who consume a lot of Skill Points, such as Imbibitor Lunae in Honkai: Star Rail.

 Best Light Cones For Hanya 
          

Hanya does not have a signature Light Cone that is tailored to her abilities. Nevertheless, there are options to choose from when building her. The best Light Cone for Hanya so far is the 5-star But The Battle Isn&#39;t Over. This has better stats compared to other Light Cones in Honkai: Star Rail. When the user activates their Ultimate, it increases their Energy Regeneration Rate by 10% and restores one Skill Point, an effect that can happen after every two uses of their Ultimate. The Light Cone also sees that when they use their Skill, the next ally taking action (except the wearer) deals 30% more DMG for one turn.



Until the release of Ruan Mei, one of the upcoming playable characters in Honkai: Star Rail 1.6, there is only one 5-star Harmony Light Cone.







If you do not have access to But The Battle Isn’t Over, you will need to resort to 4-star Light Cones for Hanya. There are some options, and choosing among them will come down to their availability and your own preference. Past And Future is a great weapon for the Physical character. When she uses her Skill, the next ally taking action (except the wearer) deals 16% increased DMG for one. Its effect is quite straightforward, but it can effectively contribute to the team’s performance, especially if the main DPS’ SPD build allows them to act immediately after Hanya.

Another decent Light Cone for Hanya is Dance! Dance! Dance!. This weapon advances all allies’ action by 16% when the user activates their Ultimate. While it does not grant offensive buffs, specifically, having the team move faster can prevent them from being harmed by enemy units, for instance. For those that do not own Bronya, pairing this Light Cone with Hanya can significantly help team comps and make up for the lack of the 5-star character. The table below lists the best builds for Hanya in Honkai: Star Rail, including the best Light Cones, Relics, Ornaments, stats, and more:




 Best Build For Hanya In Honkai: Star Rail   Light Cone    But The Battle Isn&#39;t Over (Best 5-star)   Past and Future (4-star option)   Dance! Dance! Dance! (4-star option)   Carve the Moon, Weave the Clouds (4-star option)   Memories of the Past (4-star option)      Relic &amp; Ornament Set  Relics:  Messenger Traversing Hackerspace (4 pieces)    Ornaments:  Broken Keel (2 pieces)   Fleet of the Ageless (2 pieces)   Penacony, Land of the Dreams (2 pieces - if main DPS is Physical)      Stat Priority    SPD   Energy Restoration Rate   HP   ATK   Effect RES (30% or higher, if using Broken Keel Ornaments)      Skill Priority    Talent &amp; Skill   Ultimate   Basic Attack      



Other 4-star Light Cone alternatives for Hanya include Carve The Moon, Weave The Clouds and Memories Of The Past. What you really want to look out for when choosing a Light Cone for her are items that increase her support abilities. She is not a specialist at granting Energy Regeneration Rate, but that can help her with her Ultimate, which grants buffs, for instance. Hanya is a well-rounded support unit in Honkai: Star Rail, with wide-encompassing abilities that can substantially increase the rest of the team’s performance, so almost all support stats will work well with her.



 Best Relics, Ornaments, &amp; Stats For Hanya 
          




When choosing the best Relics for Hanya in Honkai: Star Rail, you only actually have one option so far. The Messenger Traversing Hackerspace set is the best one for a support unit like Hanya. Its two-piece bonus grants the user a 6% bump to SPD. When all four pieces of the set are equipped, SPD for all allies will be increased by 12% for one turn whenever the wearer uses their Ultimate ability on an ally. The additional SPD stat for her will allow her to act before enemies and debuff them for the DPS to take advantage of.



The extra SPD for allies provided by the Relic set will stack on top of the SPD buff she naturally grants with her Ultimate, effectively making the team jump up in the Action Value list.




With Ornaments in Honkai: Star Rail, you have a few more options to choose from. Broken Keel’s two-piece bonus increases the user’s Effect RES by 10% and, when the stat reaches 30% or higher, all allies’ CRIT DMG is boosted by 10%. An alternative is Fleet of the Ageless, which increases the user’s Max HP by 12%, thus increasing their survivability and, when their SPD reaches 120 or higher, all allies’ ATK increases by 8% – this only works if you build Hanya with sufficient SPD, otherwise the secondary effect is not activated and the set goes to waste.






If the team’s main DPS is also a Physical unit, such as Argenti in Honkai: Star Rail, you can use Penacony, Land of the Dreams. This Ornament set boosts the wearer&#39;s Energy Regeneration Rate by 5% and increases DMG for all other allies with the same DMG Type as the wearer by 10%.




The stats you want to look out for when farming Relics and Ornaments are those that pertain to a support unit like Hanya. This includes SPD, Energy Regeneration Rate, HP, and ATK. SPD is the most vital stat for her, as it will allow her to act earlier and provide more SPD buffs for the team, but being able to aid with Energy, a bit of DMG, and surviving through fights is also important. If you are using the Broken Keel Ornament set, you should try to get Effect RES up to at least 30%, too.



Hanya has 110 base SPD and gets an extra 9 SPD via her Traces, for a total of 119 base SPD.






 Best Team Comps For Hanya 
         




The best team comps for Hanya are those in which she can act as a support unit to aid the main DPS and other party members in their offensive efforts. Strategically, she is best used in hypercarry teams rather than conventional ones, as putting her along with a second stat-boosting ally can make the main DPS the only needed source of damage. An important point to consider is that Hanya helps with Skill Point restoration, especially if using the But The Battle Isn&#39;t Over Light Cone, so you can use Skill-demanding units like Imbibitor Lunae or Jing Yuan in Honkai: Star Rail without worrying too much.

The table below lists a few team comp suggestions for Hanya:

 Best Team Comps For Hanya In Honkai: Star Rail   Hypercarry Team    Imbibitor Lunae (Imaginary - Destruction)   Tingyun (Lightning - Harmony) or Bronya (Wind - Harmony)   Hanya (Physical - Harmony)   Huohuo (Wind - Abundance) or Luocha (Imaginary - Abundance)      Mono Physical Team    Argenti (Physical - Erudition)   Luka (Physical - Nihility) or Silver Wolf (Quantum - Nihility)   Hanya (Physical - Harmony)   Natasha (Physical - Abundance)      Standard Flex Team    Jing Yuan (Lightning - Erudition)   Silver Wolf (Quantum - Nihility)   Hanya (Physical - Harmony)   Luocha (Imaginary - Abundance)      



Thanks to the structure of the game and how independent units work, you can get creative when building your team. Hanya’s Skill Point restoration, the buffs she provides to teammates, and the debuffs applied to enemies are not to be forgotten, so you should build your team thinking on how to make the best use of the benefits she provides – this includes considering the DPS with the highest damage output that benefits from ATK and SPD bumps, as well as healers that can heal without Skill Points, such as Luocha in Honkai: Star Rail.






 Skill Priority For Hanya 
          

When leveling Hanya’s abilities in Honkai: Star Rail, the first priority is boosting her Talent and Skill equally. These are the main sources of her debuffing potential and how you can get back Skill Points. This is the most effective way of allowing your main DPS to shine. The second priority should be her Ultimate. This is the ability that buffs the team with SPD and ATK, so it should be carefully leveled as soon as possible. The last and least important ability in her kit is her Basic ATK, which can be mostly ignored if you do not want to spend the resources.

Although she is a 4-star unit, Hanya is an incredible support character who can fit into several different team comps. The best part about her is that she is extremely easy to build, even with the lack of more Light Cone, Relic, and Ornament options that better fit her abilities. For those who enjoy hypercarry teams in Honkai: Star Rail, Hanya is a superb addition.
