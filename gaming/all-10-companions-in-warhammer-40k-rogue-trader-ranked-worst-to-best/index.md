## Literature Review

Being the Lord Commander could be a lonely job if not for these companions in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, each with unique stories and quests.




Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader puts players into the role of the Rogue Trader for the Imperium of Man, exploring the Koronus Expanse with a freedom that most humans do not hold. Despite the prestige that this title carries, the position would be one that could lead to a very lonely life if not for the series of companions that the player character can invite to join them in their adventure. These allies may not always be the most trustworthy, but each provides a unique backstory, complete with quests and possible romance, as well as assistance for the Lord Commander in dangerous circumstances.
In combat, every companion in Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader provides different abilities that can help sway the battle. They can be strategically selected to form a six-person party, including the Rogue Trader, and be outfitted with weapons and abilities to the best advantage for different circumstances. Even beyond that, however, they each have their own personalities, cultures, histories, and dialogue that add flavor and immersion to the game, and the Lord Commander can even romance a few.
            
 
 Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review: &#34;Gets What Warhammer 40,000 Is All About&#34; 
Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader translates the world of the tabletop game into an isometric RPG excellently, even with the odd clunky moment.












 








 10  Idira Tlass 
Unsanctioned Psyker
        

Idira is an unsanctioned Psyker, which means that although she has incredible psychic attacks and powers, she is untrained in her abilities. She is not sure what things she learns from her own aptitude and ability or what might be voices coming to her from beings on the other side of the Warp. In combat, her spells increase Warp Degradation, which must be managed by the player, but she can buff her allies well in the early game. After Chapter 1 in Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader, other characters become much more useful for a party than Idira.





 9  Marazhai Aezyrraesh 
Drukhari Warrior-Assassin
        

In combat, Marazhai is useful in both DPS and melee weapons, and his ability to dodge attacks gives him a defensive advantage. Sadly, he is not an option as a companion until Chapter 3, and by then, other companions can generally take care of the DPS just as effectively. From a roleplaying standpoint, Marazhai is not one to be trusted, particularly in life-or-death situations. His love of watching others (particularly humans) suffer, and his willingness to do anything it takes to save himself can become a horrifying thought when placing him as an important ally.





 8  Ulfar 
Space Wolf


 







Like Marazhai, Ulfar is not added to the party until Chapter 3 of Rogue Trader, and his strengths can be very similar to those of some of the other characters, such as Sister Argenta. He is a hybrid of Soldier and Arch-Militant, which, when used right, can become very powerful but is also much more complex than some of the others, with needing to use several combos of attacks to increase buffs. Ulfar is a fun character to have around, however, with an interesting backstory and is one of the familiar and iconic Space Marines.
Ulfar&#39;s model is very large and takes up four tiles, which can help with crowd control and is particularly useful in tight passageways for blocking attacks. 






 7  Heinrix Van Calox 
Psyker Interrogator
        

Heinrix can be a strong tank or melee DPS, depending on which build a player wants to focus on in Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. His versatility for either option can be fun to experiment with, and his psychic spells offer unique benefits to the party. His personality can be very cold and unfriendly, only softening slightly when in a romantic relationship with the Lord Commander, but even then, it can be trying.





 6  Jae Heydari 
Cold Trader


 







Jae can be found at the very start of Act 2, but she is in an optional location that is possible to miss entirely. Her abilities make her a useful leader, and she can use many strong dual-wield weapons in the game to increase her power. She can be one of the weaker characters, but she is very flexible in filling whatever opening the party requires. Her charismatic attitude helps make her a fun companion from a role-playing perspective as well, and she is also one of the romanceable NPCs in the game.

 5  Sister Argenta 
Battle Sister Of The Adepta Sororitas
        

Sister Argenta&#39;s main goal in life is to become one of the best and most faithful warriors, and her devout faith and unstoppable strength in combat can lead to her being one of the more valuable companions in Rogue Trader. She would have been number one for most players as her character was designed in the alpha and beta versions of the game, but she has since been tweaked not to be as overpowered. However, she remains a strong fighter, particularly when using a flame-build.





 4  Abelard Werserian 
Seneschal Warrior
        

Abelard can be one of the best companions that a player can have, as long as they have the patience to wait a bit for him to shine. At first, Abelard is a very weak combatant who can take a lot of hits but not do much damage in return. Later in the game, when there are more effective two-handed weapons to equip him with and he has more defensive buffs, he can become a very strong tank that can be relied on. In the story, he is a loyal right-hand man to the Lord Commander and has a lot of insight into various inhabitants of the Koronus Expanse.





 3  Pasqal Haneumann 
Magos Explorator
        

Pasqal is a Tech-Priest who can be fun to have in a party with his ability to analyze enemies, exploit weaknesses, and more, as well as things such as hacking computers, making repairs, and unlocking anything that needs it. He is very versatile with the ability to use many different weapons, and his Death World origin can let him get an increased chance of critical strikes when any enemy is below half health.





 2  Yrliet Lanaevyss 
Aeldari Ranger
        

Essentially a space elf, this Aeldari ranger can be incredibly effective at sniper shots and any other long-range attacks. Yrliet is found in Chapter 2 and starts out with a strong arsenal of Aeldari weapons and the skills of a bounty hunter. She is one of the best companions in Rogue Trader for her shooting abilities, often taking out many enemies before a battle has even gotten underway. Her personality can become quickly argumentative in dialogue choices, and she is quite condescending to the Lord Commander despite their working relationship.

 1  Cassia Orsellio 
Heiress And Navigator


 







Cassia is the only navigator in the game and has many unique powers and talents that none of the other companions will feature. Her magical powers can offer crowd control by grouping enemies and stunning them, and she is often able to take her turn first, allowing her to set up the field for the fight. Her self-healing and area-wide buffs and debuffs make her an ideal support for the party. Throughout the game, and particularly in the late-game battles, Cassia is a crucial member of every party in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.
