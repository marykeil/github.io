## Literature Review

Reddit users are known to have strong opinions. That includes when it comes to identifying the best video games for couples to play together.




Sure, romantic dinners at fancy restaurants and long walks on the beach are great ways to get to know someone, but engaging in virtual challenges of multiplayer video games like Diablo 4 or Stardew Valley can really show one&#39;s true face, and, eventually, put every relationship to the test. Besides, it&#39;s a witty option for love birds who can&#39;t spend much time together, such as in the case of a long-distance relationship. For long-term couples who are avid hobbyists, video games can be a perfect recipe to spice things up as well as for practicing communication and teamwork.




Gathering virtual experience points with a significant other often means leveling up in the real-world love life, too. There is an almost endless supply of games that can be fun to try out together, so here are the best of the best over a range of genres that couples can choose from to help narrow the choice. Of course, always decide together what sounds fun, and don&#39;t be afraid to try something new.


 Left 4 Dead 2 (2009)

This cooperative horror FPS can be a great date night idea for couples fantasizing about slaying zombies together, whether it includes smashing them with a frying pan or slicing their rotting flesh with a katana. That&#39;s exactly the kind of virtual experience that Left 4 Dead 2 offers: it&#39;s extremely amusing but also full of terrifying moments, which require good teamwork and boldness. Besides, surviving hordes of terrifying zombies can be even more fun with two more players, which means the opportunity to have a double date with another couple.






If that still doesn&#39;t sound romantic enough, there&#39;s a tunnel of love in the Dark Carnival campaign with beautiful swan boats – to fly straight into the never-ending zombie wave.

It has a story that is filled with cheeky humor and puns to keep with the lighthearted feeling, while providing fun and silly challenges to overcome together.

Escaping reality through action role-playing video games is always a good choice, especially when the experience is shared with &#34;the one.&#34; This is the case with Diablo 4&#39;s story campaign, which is ideal for couples who want to triumph over the very lords of Hell together. As a dungeon crawler, it can be played as a casual adventure that includes slaughtering monsters and getting incredible amounts of loot. Even after the base story campaign is over, there is regular seasonal content continually rotating to add even more quests and dungeons to keep things going.

                  Diablo 4 Review: Classic Dark Hack &#39;n &#39;Slash Done Right   Diablo 4 is a great addition to the series with a dark and gritty tone that is expertly balanced by the satisfaction of mowing down hordes of enemies.

                  Sackboy: A Big Adventure Review - Sackboy&#39;s Greatest Adventure Yet   Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a game full of quirky character, charm, and precise platforming perfect for the next generation on PlayStation 5.

 Resident Evil 5 (2009)
