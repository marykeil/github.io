## Literature Review

Christmas Eve Wordle is available to solve and today&#39;s answer shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for most. Here are the daily hints, and spoiled answer.





With a new word each day, it can be difficult to keep up with every Wordle answer, but it&#39;s good knowledge to have since the game doesn&#39;t seem to repeat words. At least, it hasn&#39;t done so since its inception. Remembering what words came before is a great way to figure out what the new daily answer could be.

The December 24th Wordle answer is GRACE.

For our starting word today we used IRATE, which was the best Wordle word to start with because it locked in a lot of letters right off the bat. We had the &#39;R&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, and &#39;E&#39; to work with and two incorrect letters. Moving forward we tried CRAVE as our second guess, this showed us that a &#39;C&#39; was involved but we placed it in the wrong position.

Since there was only one possible spot for the &#39;C&#39; to go we went with BRACE as our third guess. This wasn&#39;t correct but set forth an easy task to sort out which letter was the correct first one. In the end, we scored a Wordle win-in-four with the correct answer, GRACE. Another puzzle solved and another mark for our win-streak.
