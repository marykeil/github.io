## Literature Review

Magic offers a lot of opportunities in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but sometimes it&#39;s the unintended side effects that prove to be the most memorable.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 features a wide variety of magical abilities to use throughout an adventure, and this consequently means that not every supernatural effect or interaction works exactly as expected. Figuring out powerful combinations or unique exploits for spells and features is part of the fun for many, even if developer Larian Studios has taken care to patch a number of major issues to achieve a more proper ideal of balance. Some magical side effects offer no mechanical advantages at all, however, making their mark through the game&#39;s amusingly incorrect handling more than anything else.




Although Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 doesn&#39;t contain every character option that&#39;s available in tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it does have the full roster of classes from The Player&#39;s Handbook. This lineup offers several distinct approaches to magic, from the cleric&#39;s divine inspiration to the innate magic that a sorcerer can wield. Wizards might seem like the ultimate magical choice in some regards, with access to a huge spell roster full of diverse possibilities, but one feature that can provide entertainment across the course of a campaign comes from a different source.

                  &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.   


 Wild Shape &amp; Cutscenes Don&#39;t Mix In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          




Wild Shape is a particularly fun class feature of druids in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, allowing the user to take on the form of various animals for distinct advantages in combat and exploration. Using Wild Shape in DnD utilizes options determined by challenge rating and whether the character has seen the beast before, while Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 obviously has to stick to a specific list to make the feature manageable. Even so, the implementation isn&#39;t entirely smooth sailing, particularly when considering the frequently comical interaction between Wild Shape forms and cutscenes involving a character taking them on.



Owlbear is a particularly useful Wild Shape form, as the Crushing Flight class action can be especially powerful when used to its maximum potential.




The ability to play a custom character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 already makes cutscenes something of a challenge, as having animations, camera placement, and character interactions work for gnomes and elves alike can be complicated. One obvious example of this issue comes from the numerous fixes that have been deployed for romantic scenes, as a tall companion has to interact differently to kiss a short custom character, for example. Wild Shape complicates things much further, with vastly differing body types and the general lack of an ability to speak in Wild Shape form making some cutscenes clearly not work as intended.




The problem is far from universal, as Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 obviously tries to dodge awkward Wild Shape cutscenes as much as possible. Some major story ones will force a druid out of Wild Shape beforehand, while minor conversations often simply leave the character out of the equation. The solution is far from airtight, however, and anyone playing a druid and frequently using this major class feature is likely to encounter a number of moments that clearly aren&#39;t playing out in quite the way that Larian would have likely intended.



 Issues Caused By Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Wild Shape Ability 
          

Although awkward Wild Shape cutscenes can damage immersion to some degree, they can also add an extra level of comedy to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. One example (with major Act 3 spoilers) comes courtesy of Reddit user GloopTamer, who posted an interaction that plays after a significant boss fight where the game left the druid in the form of a dilophosaurus. Rather than making broken attempts at human character animations, Wild Shape forms tend to respond expressionlessly to anything that confronts them, which is especially amusing in major dramatic moments that would typically elicit notable reactions.





 

Some consequences of the issue can be more annoying than anything else, however, like an owlbear taking up the whole screen or clipping into the camera. More severely, the game&#39;s tendency to skip some character conversations if the protagonist is in Wild Shape can make druids end up missing key points in the arcs of various companions, making switching out of Wild Shape before combat ends a necessary trick to minimize the damage to the narrative. Although certain issues involving Wild Shape in cutscenes have been fixed over the course of patches, it&#39;s one Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 feature that&#39;s still far from consistent in its implementation.

                  The Funniest Content In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Is Hidden In An Act 3 Side Area   Some of the best Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 content is off the beaten path, and taking some diversions can lead to memorable gags and exciting encounters.   






 Wild Shape Is A Great Druid Feature In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
         

Not every use of Wild Shape in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 cutscenes is without reason, as the companion Halsin has some central scenes involving his transformations into a bear form. One of the game&#39;s most controversial features is an infamous scene in a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 romance with Halsin that became a major talking point before the release of the game, which makes use of Wild Shape in a way that few are likely to forget. The same possibilities don&#39;t extend to a druid protagonist&#39;s abilities, with Halsin&#39;s scene being the lone standout in that particular regard.

                  Pros And Cons Of Romancing Halsin In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   With his heroic charm and rugged good looks, Halsin is a worthy romance partner. However, love hurts in Baldur’s Gate 3. Here’s what to watch out for.   




Cutscene interactions with Wild Shape show the general difficulty of translating the DnD experience to a video game, as similar situations can easily be navigated by a dungeon master at the game table without breaking immersion. Even so, it&#39;s commendable that Larian Studios attempts to recreate the experience on the scale of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and it&#39;s easy to forgive some quirks among the vast complexities of the campaign. Certain problematic concepts like dispel magic were left out of the game entirely to make development manageable, so druids are lucky to maintain a core feature that&#39;s fundamentally challenging to properly implement.

Although cleaning up Wild Shape interactions doesn&#39;t seem to have been a major priority in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 patches so far, it&#39;s likely that Larian will fix more bugged instances as time goes on. Consequently, anyone who does want to experience a druid campaign in a particularly silly way should probably prioritize a playthrough, while those who prefer a bug-free experience might do better picking a different class or being careful about when they employ the ability. Wild Shape is one of the most entertaining class features in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but it&#39;s definitely not always in a way that was intended.
