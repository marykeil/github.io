## Literature Review

In the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC you need to beat Trials for each of the elite four, including Drayton through winning battles.





The activities required to complete these trials differ greatly from making a sandwich, passing a quiz, completing a flying time trial, and battling using certain Pokémon. Elite Four member Drayton has appeared in several Pokémon titles and is the hardest of the four to defeat in battle. He also has the most challenging trial by far, which requires a level of preparation and skill to complete.

 How To Beat The Drayton Elite Trial 
Selecting the right line-up for battle
          

To complete Drayton&#39;s trial in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC you need to head to the Polar Plaza in the top left edge of the Terarium. As opposed to some of the other trials, it doesn&#39;t cost any Blueberry Points to complete Drayton&#39;s one. Drayton&#39;s trial is called Terarium-Only Battles which involves facing and beating three other trainers before you can take on the Dragon specialist.



You can only use Pokemon that have been caught within the Terarium.







Each of the three are double battles so you want combinations of Pokémon that can take each pair out. The difficulty comes with only being able to use Pokémon caught from the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC so your squad of high-level Pokémon that you have trained up in the base game won&#39;t be eligible. However, you can use a full squad of 6 Pokémon, so you have backups in case any of them faint in battle.

You can take on the three Trainers in any order, but none should pose problems for you, as long as you use Pokémon that are super-effective against the opponent&#39;s teams. First up is Craig the Student, who uses Bastiodon and Rampardos. While both Pokémon have multiple weaknesses, they are both weak against Ground- or Fighting-type attacks.

Second up is Winter the Student, who will go with Alolan Sandshrew and Dewgong, who are both weak against Fighting-type attacks. Finally,, you will need to defeat Ray the Student, who goes into battle with Magnezone and Zebstrika. Both of these are weak to Ground-type attacks, so plenty of options exist. All of the opponents you will face use level 68 Pokémon, so using higher levels will make the battles easier for you. However, they can be defeated using lower-level Pokémon, as long as they have good type match-ups.




While Drayton&#39;s Elite trial is the toughest due to its requirements, if you catch and use Terarium Pokémon in the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC it can be completed quickly.
