## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&#39;s Daniele Gates is sharing a tragic secret about her family, which has her going back to the U.S. after her split.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Daniele Gates is living with her grandma these days for a heartbreaking reason. Daniele, a 42-year-old woman from New York, was a single mom to an adult son when she was vacationing in the Caribbean and met Yohan Geronimo, 32. Daniele and Yohan’s vacation romance took a serious turn after they decided to get married within five months of meeting. The pair first appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise season 2, and then Daniele moved to the Dominican Republic in The Other Way season 4. Yohan’s dreams were shattered because he wanted to live in America.




Daniele is now back in the U.S. and living with her grandma in her house. Daniele decided to do an impromptu Q&amp;A session with her fans when someone asked her why she was living at her grandma’s.

          

“I have been traveling back and forth to take care of her and my father since last February,” Daniele wrote. She revealed that she’d hired a nurse and a housekeeper to help her out, but her grandmother fired them “in one of her dementia rages.” Daniele said her father had to go into a nursing home next, and she was the only one left “who was willing to help” her grandma.

 Daniele Gates&#39; 90 Day Fiancé Journey Explained 
          

Daniele said that she would be bringing in a live-in caretaker in March. “And then we will see,” she explained. Daniele seems to have moved to the U.S. for good now since her split with Yohan. She quit her teaching job when she came to La Romana and decided to conduct her yoga and wellness classes online and organize retreats. Yohan was helping her with her work when he stopped working as a trainer at a local hotel and started a meat shop. The shop had to shut down, leaving Yohan jobless. He depended on Daniele for money.


 




It had been Yohan’s plan all along to get Daniele to fund his life. He expected her to splurge on him and take him to the U.S., where he would work and send money back to his family. Daniele suspected that Yohan had ulterior intentions and never filed for his spousal visa. What she didn’t know was that Yohan had been cheating on her with multiple women before they got married. Yohan moved out of Daniele’s apartment after refusing to pay for his share of their household expenses. A woman whom Yohan was having an affair with contacted Daniele and told her about Yohan’s other life.

Daniele dug into Yohan’s affairs and found out he was getting paid by the women he was interacting with. Yohan was sending them naughty photos and even meeting them in the same apartment where he lived with Daniele. Daniele decided she was going to divorce Yohan, but in November 2023, she revealed they were still together and celebrating three years of being married. Daniele is refusing to comment on her current relationship status and keeping it a mystery for those interested in knowing what happened to her after 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5.
