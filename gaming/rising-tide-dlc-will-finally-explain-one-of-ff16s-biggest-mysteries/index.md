## Literature Review

Yoshi-P has confirmed that FF16’s second DLC, Rising Tide, will tackle a gap left intentionally in the main game’s plot. Here’s what to expect.




Final Fantasy 16&#39;s second DLC, Rising Tide, will explain one of the biggest mysteries in the base game&#39;s plot. The first DLC, Echoes of the Fallen, is already out. It tells a side story mostly unrelated to the main one, in which Clive, Joshua, and Jill hunt down the source of synthetic dark crystals that have suddenly appeared on the black market. Its plot is nice, and certainly ties into the main game well, but the main focus of Echoes of the Fallen is the new bosses it adds to FF16.

By contrast, Rising Tide looks to be a more story-focused expansion, and if its higher price is any indication, it&#39;ll be longer than Echoes of the Fallen, too. Its main goal will be to fill in one of the biggest gaps left in the main plot - not a plot hole, per se, but an intentional omission. Multiple hints are dropped throughout the base game to suggest the DLC&#39;s subject, and brief glimpses in its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 seemed to confirm them. Now, a new interview with the developers has made it certain. Here&#39;s everything to know.

                  Final Fantasy 16 DLC Expansions: Story, Price &amp; Release Details   Two DLC expansions for Final Fantasy 16 were announced at The Game Awards 2023. Here’s everything there is to know about FF16’s new and upcoming DLC.   


 FF16: The Rising Tide Will Explain How Leviathan Was Lost 
          




In a post on X (formerly Twitter), user @aitaikimochi translated parts of a Famitsu interview with some of FF16’s developers, explaining that Rising Tide will reveal how and why the lost Eikon Leviathan disappeared. Leviathan&#39;s existence was already implied by the name of the DLC, Clive&#39;s use of water-elemental moves in the trailer, and the brief appearance of a serpentine beast. However, for the first time ever, DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka, co-director Hiroshi Takai, and producer Naoki &#34;Yoshi-P&#34; Yoshida now confirm that Rising Tide will finally solve the Leviathan mystery.


 

Leviathan is a recurring summon in the Final Fantasy series, like all the other Eikons in FF16. However, it&#39;s only ever mentioned offhand. Per FF16 lore, there were once more Eikons than there are at the beginning of the game. Leviathan is one of those, and its appearance has been teased for some time now. It shows up most prominently in a mural painted by members of the Circle of Malius cult; Joshua positively identifies depictions of all the major Eikons, including &#34;Leviathan the Lost.&#34;






Another mysterious Eikon in FF16 is Typhon, who only appears briefly in a boss battle. Like Leviathan, Typhon is a recurring summon throughout the Final Fantasy series, but there&#39;s no information to imply DLC will address its origins.




Some of the readings available at the Thousand Tomes in FF16 also seem to hint at additional Eikons. Although there were once eight Mothercrystals in Valisthea, by the time the game begins, only five remain. There were definitely other Eikons associated with these, Leviathan potentially being one of them, but they don&#39;t appear in-game. Thankfully, Rising Tide will address at least one or two of these mysteries.



 FF16: Rising Tide Will Also Explain Leviathan&#39;s Connection To The Circle Of Malius 
          

FF16 also strongly implies that Leviathan is somehow connected to the Circle of Malius, an ancient cult from which many Valisthean traditions unwittingly stem. The Famitsu interview confirms that DLC will address these connections as well, revealing more about FF16&#39;s complicated chronology and millennia of world history. The Circle of Malius is an ancient Fallen religion in FF16. Its adherents worship Ultima as a messianic figure, destined to usher in an age of peace. The Circle of Malius was mostly disbanded 1,500 years prior to the start of FF16, when much of its clergy, writings, and holy sites were destroyed in the War of the Magi.




However, much of Malian theology has been passed down through history, albeit indirectly. Some in Valisthea, like the historian Moss the Chronicler, have made attempts to study the Circle of Malius. And the major modern religions in FF16 certainly take cues from its doctrine. The Crystalline Orthodoxy worships the Mothercrystals, which were created by Ultima, and the Akashic cult Jill was forced into believes in salvation through Ultima&#39;s aether.

Others consider themselves direct adherents to the Circle of Malius - most notably Barnabas, the Waloeder king. Barnabas is actually the latest in a long line of Malius followers. His mother was persecuted for her religious beliefs, which led to Barnabas&#39; eventual flight to Valisthea. Unlike most worshipers, however, Barnabas takes direct orders from Ultima itself, attempting to manipulate Clive into fulfilling his potential as Mythos.

As suggested by the mural Clive and Joshua find in FF16&#39;s base game, the Circle of Malius also worshiped Eikons as gods. It only makes sense, as they&#39;re the creations and tools of Ultima. Since the Circle of Malius existed before Leviathan was lost, its members were familiar with the Eikon of Water, and counted it among their gods. Could their artifacts lead Clive to find Leviathan the Lost in Rising Tide? What other clues exist to point the way?






 Many Hints Suggest How Leviathan Was Lost 
          

Presumably, Leviathan was once on par with all of Valisthea&#39;s other major Eikons, like Phoenix, Titan, Shiva, and Odin. But each of these has a society, a Mothercrystal, and a line of Dominants revolving around them, so where are Leviathan&#39;s? It&#39;s not likely that Leviathan&#39;s Dominant bloodline, the Motes of Water, died out completely. Clive is able to wield Leviathan&#39;s might in Rising Tide, and throughout the rest of FF16, he&#39;s seen to be able to claim Eikons&#39; power from their living hosts. Therefore, that&#39;ll probably happen again in Rising Tide, which means there must be a Dominant of Leviathan somewhere out there.

It wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch for the Motes of Water to have gone into hiding. Perhaps they want no part of the war that plagues the rest of Valisthea, and, fearing enslavement, have kept their powers to themselves. The first trailer for FF16&#39;s two DLCs has teased new characters - one of these could easily be Leviathan&#39;s Dominant.




Dzemekys Falls may also provide a clue as to Leviathan&#39;s whereabouts. In the middle of the desert outside Dhalmekia, there&#39;s an enormous, circular crater located in the middle of a lake, with water flowing down on all sides. As lore has it, this site, called Dzemekys Falls, is the former home of a Mothercrystal. The historic event that sparked the War of the Magi, the Sins of Dzemekys, occurred here some millennia ago.

Humanity, wanting to claim the power of gods for themselves, cracked open the Mothercrystal here in an attempt to absorb its aether. The gods retaliated, destroying the crystal and the surrounding area in such a violent onslaught that it left a giant, watery crater in the very earth. It would make perfect sense for Leviathan&#39;s Mothercrystal to have been located here, and for its Dominants to have gone into hiding after their home was destroyed. The Fallen ruins nearby may have been home to Leviathan&#39;s Dominants, or to Circle of Malius adherents who worshiped it.




Leviathan is still a mystery for now, but it won&#39;t remain that way for long. With the new announcements surrounding the DLC, there&#39;s a definite breadcrumb trail to follow - but final answers are still a ways away. The truth of Leviathan&#39;s loss will only be revealed when the Rising Tide DLC for Final Fantasy 16 is released in Spring 2024.
