## Literature Review

As time passes in Valheim, your need for teleporters can grow fast, but with everything else you need to build you may want to make a travel hub room.





The best way to make a Portal &#34;hub&#34; comes from making at least two Portals near each other as you expand your base. You will need plenty of materials to construct each Portal, and you may want to build a fast travel area in a space that can be protected from enemies. Thankfully, Portals are not affected by rain or other environmental hazards in the different biomes you visit in Valheim.






Remember to change the name of each Portal you build so that you do not confuse them with each other as you add more fast travel spots to your hub.




                  10 Things to Know Before Playing Valheim   Surviving in Valheim&#39;s wilderness can be challenging for new players, but by following these tips, players can set themselves up for future glory.   


 Tips For Building a Fast Travel Hub 


 
The best method for building a fast travel hub involves making all your Portals in a single building and creating the Portals near the area where you store items. Putting Portals close to where you keep Obsidian or Flint in Valheim lets you easily pick up what you need before traveling elsewhere. The ideal location for a travel hub offers an easy way to grab your stuff quickly.

One of the most common burdens in Valheim is when you become encumbered with basic resources like Wood or Stone. Having a fast travel hub near your storage allows you to easily dump these materials back at your base before returning to where you were before. Remember that you need a large area with room to host many Portals that can exist close to your storage.




Minimalist or compact designs work best for a fast travel hub, but ambitious architects might want to consider making a portable Portal. For larger exploration trips, you can bring the supplies necessary to make a normal Portal and keep your hublight in Valheim with only a few Portals. This saves time from building a larger Portal nexus if you haven&#39;t gotten the chance to expand your base just yet. 



Keep in mind that the Portal at your home base should have a name that&#39;s easy for people to remember, especially if you decide to use a portable Portal during your adventure.




Once you&#39;ve decided where to build your hub, equip a Hoe to level the ground for a much easier time making the structures you might need. Create walls, floors, or other supports to extend your home base to connect with this Portal nexus. The best base builds in Valheim always include a cart for extra storage as you play around with elevation and other construction techniques. 






 How To Create a Fast Travel Hub 

 

Every fast travel hub a player creates in Valheim will look different from one that another person creates, but one consistent key to this project is to cart all the materials needed to your building site. You can even make a teleporter directly from the site to your primary storage to get the needed items faster. However, doing this will cause you to deal with multiple loading screens during your project.

A step-by-step tutorial by YouTube creator GReimer Gaming showcases how Portals work best when put near the interior of the hub you are building. Feel free to adjust the hub as your need for extra Portals grows over time in Valheim. Knocking down walls or adding floors vertically are easy ways to stretch your Portal nexus out, but be careful not to destroy sections that could expose your main base.




                  Valheim: Every Ore &amp; Where To Find Them   Valheim contains many ores for players to find and mine as they travel through its various biomes, and gathering these makes for better tool crafting.   

You can also replace Portals you no longer need as you develop your fast travel hub. The materials you receive from breaking down old Portals could be used to construct new ones in the same area. However, remember the names of Portals and where they go when you destroy and rebuild since it can be confusing to remember where each Portal leads if you take it down too fast.

Communication is key when you are playing Valheim with other players who are going to be using a fast travel hub as much as you. The names of Portals are important to convey where they travel to, so make sure to build ones that convey their purpose within your base. As long as the layout makes sense, the result can look like whatever you desire. 



 How to Decorate a Fast Travel Hub 
          




Decoration can both make your fast travel hub look fantastic and visually communicate facts about where each Portal leads better than a name could. For example, a Portal with the trophy of a defeated boss right next to it might tell someone that the teleportation goes to the area where that boss was fought in Valheim. Your options are nearly endless regarding what clues you want to leave at different Portals.

Most objects beyond basic wood structures will require Fine Wood to make, so ensure a steady supply before you place many decorations. One of the most common decorations is a large archway above a Portal in your hub. Stone Pillars or curved wooden structures are great ways to make each fast travel spot feel like it leads somewhere important in Valheim.

Torches, Item Stands, and Sconces are also significant visual indicators to help distinguish Portals from one another. Weapons like Axes, tools such as Fishing Rods and Pickaxes, and many more objects could signify a teleporter&#39;s purpose better than any name as well. Signs can also communicate a Portal&#39;s exact name in Valheim before you check on it with your character.




Those who learn to build a fast travel hub in Valheim will have the perfect way to explore Valhalla to its fullest without the usual monotony of traveling in a large world.
