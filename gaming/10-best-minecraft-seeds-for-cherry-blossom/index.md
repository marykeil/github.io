## Literature Review

The Cherry Blossom biome is fairly hard to find in Minecraft, but players can generate worlds that guarantee this environment using the best seeds.





You can use a seed that has a specific number sequence to ensure a Cherry Blossom biome appears on your map when generating a world. The best seeds for Minecraft&#39;s 1.20 update can be accessed by going to the &#34;More Options&#34; section when creating a new sandbox in Minecraft. From here, inputting the right seed could make a world with specific biomes, structures, or resources you might want.

 10  Small Cherry Forest 
Seed: -6384763643152943458


An icy mountain range protects a crater you spawn in for this Minecraft seed, filled with Cherry Blossom trees in a secluded valley. This small forest offers you a taste of the new biome but also gives you plenty of resources to work with at the start. Several caves along the snow-capped peaks are great places to explore for more materials.
This seed gives you the perfect impression of the potential of a Cherry Grove forest, which could be a fantastic region to begin making a home. Those who establish an initial base in this area should have plenty of items to help them venture beyond the mountains into the wider Minecraft world. 
Seeds used to generate worlds sometimes differ between the Bedrock and Java editions of the game, which may have slight variations that affect the player&#39;s experience.

 9  Cherry Blossom Island 
Seed: 6490327980339166064
        

This seed puts you on a Survival Island when you spawn, which limits your resources in a smaller area. This type of map appeals to anyone who wants their adventure to be more challenging. The best island seeds in Minecraft typically have many secrets in such a small land formation and often include rare structures for you to discover.
The Cherry Blossom in this world is found at the top of the island and serves as an excellent staging ground for a journey with a tougher path ahead as you face greater hardships. Building a base on top of the island lets you see hostile mobs before they approach and set up your defenses in Minecraft ahead of time. 





 8  Frozen Lake of Cherries 
Seed: -6384763642895912697
        

This unique seed creates an environment almost perfectly divided in half between the new Cherry Blossom biome and the recently added Ice Spikes region. The sharp contrast between the warm pink and cold blue landscapes rests on cliffs surrounding a partially frozen lake below. Many caves can be spotted along the walls of the circular cliff walls for you to delve into for underground materials in Minecraft.
These polar opposite biomes combine to form a truly gorgeous world that offers two perspectives you can explore in equal measure.





 7  Cherry Blossom Mountain Crater 
Seed: -6384763642759109712


Like the Small Cherry Forest, this seed puts you within another crater rich with resources to gather for a strong starting base in Minecraft. However, according to YouTube creator Minecraft &amp; Chill, the larger size of the Cherry Grove here could attract Bees or one of the new mobs introduced in the 1.20 update. Honey and Honeycombs produced by Bees are excellent materials for many crafting recipes. 





 6  Icy Blossom Gorge 
Seed: -6384763643079588144
        

Cherry Blossoms seem to work well in the best snowy 1.20 seeds, and this world further supports that theory. This seed puts you in a Cherry Blossom forest next to a massive ravine biome that you can spelunk into for a wide variety of the game&#39;s best resources. Coal, Iron, and even a few Diamonds can be found at the bottom of this gorge for those brave enough to travel below the trees.
The caves near the ravine&#39;s base also contain rare structures, like Ancient Cities and Strongholds. Finding a Stronghold puts you closer to reaching The End and defeating the powerful Ender Dragon. Having this structure so close to a base built in the Cherry Blossom region is extremely convenient for anyone trying to take on Minecraft&#39;s final boss as soon as possible. 





 5  Lake &amp; Village Blossom Valley 
Seed: -6384763642861273108


 







Villages are always welcome in a Minecraft world; this seed and a beautiful Cherry Blossom nearby provide that. A large lake next to a small civilization forms a few rivers that scatter into the grassland meadows near a vast collection of Cherry trees. The treasures and crops you find within the Village will help you build a home quickly inside Cherry Grove without almost any challenge.

 4  Meadow of Love 
Seed: 4730575252807339304
        

This seed creates a one-of-a-kind landscape in Minecraft that shows a massive heart-shaped valley surrounded by cherry blossom trees. Perhaps the most awe-inspiring instance of the new biome yet, this natural formation can be found at coordinates (-625, 110, -173). When you visit this spot, you can make a base within the heart or among the trees cradling the valley. 





 3  Cherry Cliffs 
Seed: -7546871049307550237
        

Another large lake hosts a larger Cherry Blossom biome in this seed, but this body of water has a few more secrets to uncover. When you spawn in this world, you&#39;ll be able to see three different streams of lava emerging from the cliff walls in a breathtaking display of molten danger. The icy mountains, cave systems, and pink forests are begging to be explored as you journey around the cliff&#39;s perimeter.





 2  Chain of Cherry Blossoms 
Seed: 3368699220760197849
        

The largest Cherry Grove seen in the 1.20 update is from this seed, which stretches a pink forest around hundreds of blocks on top of a series of hills. Climbing up to a higher elevation in this seed will surround your character in a world of pink trees as far as the eye can see. While a Village here and other forests also dot the landscape, they pale compared to the sheer volume of Cherry Blossoms you can find. 





 1  Village at the Heart of Cherries 
Seed: 4167799982467607063
        

This seed spawns you into a thriving community built around a Cherry Blossom, which forms a near-perfect unity between man and nature. Stunning pink trees envelop home after home toward the horizon, with both giving you everything you need to start an adventure. The Villagers in this space are more than happy to trade with travelers visiting the region or those who decide to stay in this pristine town.
The best seeds for Cherry Blossoms in Minecraft emphasize beauty but ensure you have the resources you need to survive in the open-world sandbox.
