## Literature Review

During Winterfest, Fortnite players can find and defeat Krampus, a holiday-themed boss. However, enemy players can also disrupt your boss fight.





To find Krampus, you will need to land directly south of Hazy Hillside, one of the best landing spots in Fortnite this season. Unlike other NPC bosses in the game, Krampus is rather popular. As such, if you aim to complete your Winterfest quests, it’s highly recommended that you beeline straight for his location and land early. This gives you an advantage over other players, ensuring you’re ultimately the one to take him down.




                  All NPC Locations In Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1   Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1&#39;s eight NPC Characters will trade useful items and perks to players in return for Gold Bars. Here&#39;s how to find them all.   


 How To Find Krampus&#39; Location In Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 
          

Krampus can be found inside a cabin at the location marked above, south of Hazy Hillside. He will stay inside, so it’s generally safe for you to land outside the cabin to pick up some guns and gear. Prioritize taking out any other players who land here if possible. As a boss in Fortnite, Krampus isn’t particularly challenging, but the presence of other enemy players can make completing your quests harder than it needs to be.

If you are completing a Winterfest Ship It! Express Snapshot quest that requires you to use a Sneaky Snowmando Disguise to sneak up on Krampus; purchase one from Leelah. She’s one of the NPCs and can be found patrolling the Stormy Station landmark in the hills east of Hazy Hillside. Leelah will sell you the right item for 100 Gold Bars.




You might also have another quest objective asking you to deploy a beacon on Krampus’s present stash. This can be found outside the cabin. It’s marked, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble interacting with it to deploy the beacon in Fortnite.

Krampus isn’t too hard to fight despite his intimidating appearance. Unlike other bosses this season, Krampus relies solely on his pickaxe to attack. As such, he’s entirely limited to melee combat, allowing you to take him down at range. Any weapon tends to work well, but the Ballistic Shield is particularly excellent as it protects you from attacks from the front.



Fortnite’s Snowball Launcher has also been unvaulted, so you can easily use one to flatten Krampus and his cabin.







          

Once defeated, Krampus drops a blue Rare Chest that you can pop open. The chest is guaranteed to drop some high-quality loot, but its contents are randomized, so there’s no way to determine what drops before you open it.

Keep in mind that each of the Ship It! Express Snapshot quests grant 15,000XP when completed. As such, finding and defeating Krampus is a great way to quickly gain some XP for your Fortnite Battle Pass this season.
