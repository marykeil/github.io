## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s Wolverine might not be too long in coming, which would seem like a pipe dream if not for some key evidence that supports the idea.




The release of Marvel&#39;s Wolverine may not actually be all that far away, and there&#39;s a good reason why its arrival in the near future could be genuinely feasible. Developer Insomniac Games has just released Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, and the major nature of this venture could very well make it seem like Marvel&#39;s Wolverine might not have had major development resources allocated to it until now. Marvel&#39;s Wolverine also represents a bigger ground-up venture in some regards than the last couple of Spider-Man games, as it doesn&#39;t have a preceding game from Insomniac to use as a foundation.




So far, Insomniac has remained generally tight-lipped on Marvel&#39;s Wolverine, with the game&#39;s only teaser trailer featuring a short cinematic rather than any actual gameplay footage. What it does show is Logan&#39;s claws emerging from his bloodied knuckles, reinforcing the idea that the game is much more likely to feature violent brawling than the comparatively clean beat-em-up approach of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man. It&#39;s also likely to be somewhat smaller in scale considering Wolverine&#39;s comparative lack of mobility, which should ideally give it the opportunity to feature strong bespoke level design.

                  Why Wolverine Isn&#39;t In Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Setting Up The Next Insomniac Game   Prior toÂ Spider-Man 2&#39;s launch, many had speculated that the title would set up Insomniac&#39;s Wolverine game, however, this was not the case.   


 Marvel&#39;s Wolverine Is Rumored To Release Soon 
          




Launching Marvel&#39;s Wolverine the year after Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 might seem like an unbelievably aggressive turnaround, but rumors have circulated around a planned 2024 launch window for the game. Most recently, the inclusion of a 2024 date in the ArtStation profile of a concept artist for the game has served as further corroboration for this idea, as reported by PlayStation LifeStyle. This isn&#39;t hard proof, and it&#39;s also possible that even a planned window could easily end up seeing delays, but it does seem to indicate that Marvel&#39;s Wolverine won&#39;t be too long coming in any scenario.

                  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 Having Wolverine Could Recreate Venom&#39;s Best Boss   If Insomniac introduced its take on Wolverine in a Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 cameo, it could lead to a recreation of one of Venom&#39;s best boss battles.

The main reason that this idea actually seems feasible is Insomniac&#39;s general efficiency, as recent years have seen them put out high-quality titles at a speed that would be foreign to most studios. The 2018, 2020, and 2023 releases for Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, a remaster of the game, and its two followups are already impressive enough, but they seem much more notable considering the release of several games in the interim spots. The AR and VR games Seedling, Stormland, and Strangelets might not be comparatively sized ventures, but they certainly count for something, and 2020&#39;s Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart definitely qualifies as a major release for the studio.

                  Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart Review - An Essential PS5 Adventure   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is truly phenomenal, with magnificent graphics and gameplay, and a near-perfect understanding of what the PS5 can offer.   

Running multiple projects alongside each other is clearly something that Insomniac Games has plenty of experience with, so Marvel&#39;s Wolverine might well be further along in development than anyone realizes. Of course, a release target is only a target, and polishing the game while avoiding employee crunch ultimately matters more than hitting a window that hasn&#39;t even been officially confirmed yet. Whether it manages a 2024 release or not, it does definitely seem possible that Insomniac could have Marvel&#39;s Wolverine ready in the near future.
