Kratos’ story in God of War Ragnarok now starts a new adventure in the Valhalla DLC, venturing through his past in a roguelite fashion. Kratos has a lot of different weapons, upgrades, and customization choices to make to get through the DLC in one piece, but some are more powerful than others. For long-time franchise fans, the Blade of Olympus presents a notable and powerful option for getting past your foes.

 How To Find The Blade of Olympus in God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla 
          

Getting the Blade of Olympus will require working through the early story missions in the Valhalla DLC. Luckily, it will be fairly early, as it is the end reward for completing the second objective in the DLC mode, Homecoming. In it, you will encounter Helios - or a part of him - once more, and you must escort him to a cage to destroy him. After a cut scene, you will be instructed to press both sticks, activating the Blade of Olympus for the first time.




After receiving it, you will leave Valhalla shortly after, and if you want to use it again, you have to stop on the Shores before heading back in. The Shores are also where you can make permanent upgrades in God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla. There is a spot near the stairs leading into Valhalla designated the Spartan Rage selector where you can change what happens when Kratos’ rage meter fills. Scroll through it and select the Legacy option for the Blade of Olympus.

Once equipped, when Kratos’ rage meter is full, you can again click in both sticks to attack with the Blade of Olympus, one of the most powerful weapons in God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla. Players can keep refilling their rage meter by parrying; this weapon will also recover some health when enemies are killed. You can press the sticks again if all enemies are defeated before the rage meter runs out to save the Blade of Olympus for another day in God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla.
