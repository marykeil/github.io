## Literature Review

The Eggs-Pedition Access timed research event for Pokémon GO gifts players ways to explore new Pokémon through its hatching and gifting perks.





To unlock Pokémon GO&#39;s Eggs-Pedition access, go to the shop and purchase it for around $5.00 USD. There is also an option to gift an event ticket to a family member or friend. Shortly after, the month-long egg-hatching service will begin. A timed research will appear on the news and research screens, mainly focused on hatching eggs and giving gifts. When players start to spin Pokéstops, they will receive their first rewards.




                  Pokémon GO Shiny Odds (&amp; Why Raids Are Best) Explained   Shiny odds in Pokémon GO work very differently compared to the rates in the mainline series. There are a few factors that make them so different.   


 Eggs-Pedition Bonuses 
          

The extra perks that the Eggs-Pedition specific bonuses give to participating Pokémon GO players are:

  1 Single-Use Incubator for the first Pokéstop spin of the day   3x XP for the first catch of the day   3x XP for the first Pokéstop spin of the day   A maximum of 50 gifts can be opened per day   A maximum of 150 gifts can be sent per day   A maximum of 40 gifts can be stored in the Item Bag  

This means that for however many days you have left for the timed research event, players can hatch up to 31 eggs! To gain all the benefits the gift system has for a player, adding many friends through Discord, social media, or the new Pokémon GO Companion App within the game is also recommended.






There are public invitations to Discord servers such as Pokémon and The Pokémon Center. These communities have many players looking for new friends to give gifts to and do raids together.
