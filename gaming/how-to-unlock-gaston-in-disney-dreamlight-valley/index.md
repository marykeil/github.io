## Literature Review

The Pumpkin King Returns update to Disney Dreamlight Valley has included many new characters to unlock, including Gaston from Beauty and the Beast.





Before you can recruit Gaston, you must purchase the expansion A Rift in Time for Disney Dreamlight Valley. There are a variety of quests to pursue throughout a new region, with plenty of things to discover as you run into familiar faces. Make sure to check your map and uncover locations seen in the expansion so you know where to go for missions involving Gaston later in the game.

 How To Recruit Gaston In Disney Dreamlight Valley 
          

After meeting Rapunzel, you need to find food for Gaston in the Glittering Dunes, open a path to the Wastes, and finally unlock the Cave of Wonders to recruit Gaston. Getting through the main story quests will eventually lead you to the Dunes in Disney Dreamlight Valley. You can find Gaston to your left, in an area right next to a cascading pile of sand in this desert region.

Gaston asks you to get him food, which you can find around the biome introduced in the recent update. You must collect Agave Dates and catch Scorpions in Disney Dreamlight Valley to satisfy Gaston&#39;s appetite. Once Gaston has eaten, he&#39;ll ask for help looking for clues around his campsite to clear a path into the Wastes.




Go to the Coconut Husks by the barrels near Gaston&#39;s BBQ to find one clue, with another in a chest behind his tent called Homemade Glude. The final Paint Palette clue rests on a box far from the camp tent. Doing all this will allow you to fish for the LeFou item in the quicksand near Gaston and find the Desert Scarab Piece in the Plains region using the Royal Hourglass.



The Wastes area costs 4,000 Mist to unlock, in addition to the items you must find for Gaston. For other tasks in the quest with Jafar and Gaston, you&#39;ll need 3 Dream Shards and 1,000 more Mist.




These tasks lead you to &#34;The Wild Tangle&#39;s Swarm&#34; quest with Gaston and Jafar after Gaston has had a few hours of downtime to &#34;re-center&#34; himself. Speak to Rapunzel to make two Carnivorous Floral Arrangements to collect the Jungle Scarab Piece item from captured bugs. This will let you clean the item, then follow Jafar and Gaston north to reveal a way into the Cave of Wonders.




Simply solve every puzzle in the Cave of Wonders, then speak to Gaston again to unlock him permanently in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
