## Literature Review

Starter Pokémon have arrived with the Indigo Disk DLC, including the Treeko, Torchic, and Mudkip from the Gen 3 Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald games.





The new and returning Pokémon to Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s DLC include a variety of fan favorites, like the Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald starters. You have to finish the main story of the game and the first part of the DLC to access The Indigo Disk. Progressing far enough into the new expansion allows you to join the League Club to earn Battle Points (BP) or currency gained after completing various quests.




                  One New Legendary Pokémon In Indigo Disk DLC Was Hiding All Along   It seems like one of the new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk has been hiding in the base games, Scarlet and Violet, for over a year.   


 How To Find &amp; Catch Treeko 
          

The Grass-type Treeko will appear on your map to find and catch once you spend 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; in the Canyon Biome. One of the quests found on computer terminals within the Terarium lets you put BP into different projects managed by organizations within the League Club. The one mentioned here fine-tunes the type of Pokémon in certain areas of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.

As you explore and defeat powerful trainers in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s The Indigo Disk DLC, you can capture this starter to train in a new Generation. Explore the Canyon Biome as much as possible to come across at least one Treeko in the wild eventually. Engaging them in battle and reducing their health to the red gives you the best chance to add the starter to your roster.






 How To Find &amp; Catch Torchic 
          

The lovable Fire-type Torchic can be found and caught after you use 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; in the Polar Biome. This frigid land may seem unlikely to hold a bird made of flames, but you won&#39;t find this starter anywhere else in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Other beginning companions will appear in the region from other Gens once you finish the quest to boost the variety of species.



 How To Find &amp; Catch Mudkip 
          

The final starter from Gen 3, the Water-type Mudkip, is found when you &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Coastal Biome by investing 3,000 BP. It may be challenging to catch these Pokémon since they often hide in large bodies of water. Make sure to travel along the shores of this region to spot a Mudkip before it can go back into the murky depths of a pond, lake, or even the ocean in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.




Every Gen 3 starter that appears in The Indigo Disk DLC of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is fairly easy to track down, but only if you have the 12,000 BP necessary to unlock them in quadrants of the new map.

              Pokemon Scarlet and Violet  4.5 / 10   Pokémon returns in its next installment series: Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Set in a fictional town near Mediterranean Spain, gamers will explore Paldea, catching new and classic Pokémon. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is the first ever open-world game in the series and features new Pokémon that can transform into vehicles. Pokémon staples like gym battles are still present, but co-op exploration and Terastallize battles are also introduced.
