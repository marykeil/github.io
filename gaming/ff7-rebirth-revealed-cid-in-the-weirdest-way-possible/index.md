## Literature Review

Cid Highwind, a classic character from the original Final Fantasy 7, is returning in FF7 Rebirth. Here is how is new design looks, and why it&#39;s great.




The revelation of Cid Highwind in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth occurred in the weirdest way possible. Cid is a classic character from the original Final Fantasy 7 who is making a revamped reappearance in the upcoming sequel to Final Fantasy 7 Remake. In the original title, Cid Highwind is an ex-Shinra engineer who lives in Rocket Town and defies his previous employers. His most notable contribution is lending the Tiny Bronco plane to the party so that they can traverse Midgar. He is unlockable as a playable character.




This leads to believe he may end up becoming a playable character in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth as well, even if unconfirmed for now. Cid Highwind is a very important character in the story, especially in the middle portion of the campaign, which will be portrayed by the second title in the remake series. He has now been revealed as a character in the upcoming title, though the way Cid was shown was a bit underwhelming considering his relevance to the flow of the story arc.

 Cid Appeared For A Few Seconds In A Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Trailer At TGA 2023 
          

The official revelation of Cid Highwind in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth occurred during the trailer for the title shown at The Game Awards 2023, as posted by the official TGA account on X. However, the video was mixed in with a live musical performance and, in such a manner, Cid appears for only a few seconds as he pilots the Tiny Bronco airplane. This is a massively underwhelming debut of such an important character in the story. Luckily, Cid gets a few extra seconds in the complete version of the trailer, posted on the official Final Fantasy channel on YouTube.






In the trailer, Cid talks to Aerith, saying he wants to help her on her mission.






 Cid’s Updated Design In Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Reflects His Real Age 
          

Aside from the clear reference to the character and his well-known airplane, there is something noteworthy about Cid’s revamped design: he looks his age. Cid Highwind is, officially, 32 years old. However, in the original game, Cid’s artwork and overall character design made him look like a much older man. His rugged aspect aged him a lot, so much so that he does not look like a 32-year-old man. In Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, that seems to be taken into consideration, as he looks quite jovial.


 




In the trailer, Cid can be seen wearing his airplane pilot clothes and goggles on his forehead. Despite the fact that he still looks rugged, which seems intentional and possibly related to his unhealthy chain-smoking persona, he does not look too old, which was the main issue with his original design. Cid’s updated design is one of the many that will be seen with the release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, including Vince Valentine, Bugenhagen, and even Dyne.
