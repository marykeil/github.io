## Literature Review

Break the game and conquer all the party’s enemies with the all-powerful Aeterna Sword in Claude’s hands in Star Ocean: The Second Story R.





While Star Ocean: The Second Story R is a remake, the game&#39;s original version also had this sword, but it was called the Eternal Sphere. This sword can be equipped for Claude or Dias, but it is more suited to Claude. There are three main steps for getting the Aeterna Sword, and you will need Claude to have a decent level.




                  “A Charming Remake” - Star Ocean: The Second Story R Review   The Second Story R introduces many new mechanics and systems for a faithful reinterpretation of a highly revered PS1 classic.    


 How To Get The Aeterna Sword in Star Ocean: The Second Story R 
          

The first step in getting the Aeterna Sword will be to complete the Lacuer Tournament when you reach it during the story. To get the sword, you must get as far in the tournament as possible. Of note, Claude cannot win this tournament but can come second, which is the goal. Without coming second, Claude cannot get the sword, so make sure your combat skills in Star Ocean: The Second Story R are solid.



Save before every step in this process, in case you do not accomplish the goal and do not have to start an entirely new playthrough to succeed.







The second step is to go to the blacksmith’s house, assuming you have completed the tournament. Speak to Gamgee directly after doing so, as you will not get the chance again, and he will give you the Deadly Edge. The Deadly Edge is the unmodified version of the sword, and while it is good, there is one last thing to do to turn it into the Aeterna Sword.

The last step is to use Mithril to modify the Deadly Edge. To get Mithril, start leveling up some of the party members you do not plan on using as much throughout the game. There are many playable characters in the Star Ocean series, and you should have one or two you wouldn&#39;t mind leveling up for the Mithril. You will want to level up their ESP, rewarding you with a random item every time. Do this until you have two Mithril in your inventory, resetting a save each time if necessary.

Once you have the Mithril, use Claude to customize the Deadly Edge with Mithril, but you will need to have Claude’s Customization at Level 9 to make this a success. Again, save your progress to reset it if it is unsuccessful the first time. You are looking for the first customization to be the Blade of Minos. Once it is successful, save and then customize it a second time with Mithril to turn into the Aeterna Sword in Star Ocean: The Second Story R.
