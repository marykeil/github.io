## Literature Review

RDR2â€™s ending is devastating no matter what, but doing something nice just for Arthur can help soften the blow. Here are a few ways to say goodbye.




The final moments of Red Dead Redemption 2 can be pretty intense, so it&#39;s nice to take some time for Arthur before heading into the final mission. Players really get to know everything about RDR2&#39;s characters throughout - their secrets, their pasts, their hopes, and eventually, their ends. As a result, it hurts to say goodbye, even if they already know what&#39;s going to happen.
[Warning: This article contains spoilers for the ending of RDR2.]
It should come as no surprise, since he&#39;s basically given a death sentence early on, but Arthur eventually succumbs to tuberculosis or gets into a gang fight, and dies at the end of RDR2. It&#39;s abundantly clear when the end of the game is approaching, so players have plenty of time to wrap up anything they haven&#39;t completed and spend a few final moments with Arthur before he makes his last stand. Here are a few good ways to make sure Arthur leaves the world a better place than he found it.

 10  Ride Across The Map 
Say Goodbye To Arthur&#39;s Horse


 







Arthur spends a lot of time with his fastest horse in RDR2, and since they don&#39;t make it out of the final chapter either, it&#39;s a good idea to do a little interspecies bonding before finishing the game. One nice way to do that is to plot a route across the entire map, taking it slowly and enjoying the scenery along the way. At the end, Arthur can find a quiet spot to camp, feed, and brush his horse, allowing the two to enjoy a moment together before everything falls apart.





 9  Find A Scenic Spot 
Take A Moment To Breathe
        

In a Reddit thread where commenters shared their favorite ways to say goodbye to Arthur, original poster SneakySpartan01 explained their preference for sitting at Horseshoe Overlook, taking in the scenery before Arthur&#39;s last ride. Of course, Horseshoe Overlook has special significance for Arthur - it&#39;s the first comfortable place the van der Linde gang makes camp during the course of RDR2. But really, any scenic spot will work, giving both Arthur and the player an opportunity to meditate on everything that&#39;s come before, and everything that&#39;s likely to come after.







 8  Say Howdy To Everyone In Town 
Valentine, Saint Denis, Or Blackwater


 







RDR2 allows Arthur to carry on brief conversations with random NPCs. This can create a nice, friendly atmosphere, and over time, all those Honor points do add up. To spread a measure of kindness throughout the world before Arthur takes his final bow, it might be nice to pick a favorite town and say hello to everyone who passes by. There won&#39;t be much by way of rewards, but it&#39;ll be a nice sendoff for a more good-aligned version of Arthur.





 7  Shave &amp; A Haircut 
Give Arthur A New Look
        

If Arthur has to die, he might as well look good doing it. Before his final mission, Arthur should book a night in a hotel, wash off some of that road dust, and get a haircut somewhere in town. It couldn&#39;t hurt to change his clothes, either; something all-black would certainly suit the occasion. Either way, all this will ensure that Arthur looks his best in his last few scenes, leaving the player with the best possible memories of their time with him.





 6  Go Fishing Or Hunting 
Take A Break With Arthur
        

It might also be nice to spend some of Arthur&#39;s final days indulging in his favorite pastimes, like hunting or fishing. He&#39;s done so much work to fund the camp, so it&#39;s only fair that he should take a bit of time off. Plus, hunting and fishing, even in RDR2, can have a meditative quality, fitting for Arthur to think about how far he&#39;s come. Players may even set some new records, complete their bestiaries, or bag a buck worth a pretty penny.





 5  Cook A Last Meal 
And Pour A Last Drink
        

RDR2 has a pretty simple crafting and cooking system, but eating food is regardless a necessary part of survival. Drinking is less necessary, but it can be a bit of fun - Arthur&#39;s slurred dialogue is hilarious, especially during RDR2&#39;s wild party scenes. For his last hurrah, Arthur should cook the best meal he can with the ingredients he has available, and have a few glasses of that fancy, aged pirate rum he&#39;s been saving the entire game. He&#39;s not going to have much use for it afterward.





 4  Wrap Up Any Unfinished Business 
Collectibles, Side Missions, Achievements


 







While some content is still available after Arthur dies and John Marston takes over protagonist duties, other things are locked out. Even still, it wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing to finish up any remaining side content before Arthur&#39;s last ride. Whether it&#39;s hunting rare animals, collecting dinosaur bones, or wrapping up Strangers side quests, completing all the side content means putting the most satisfying possible button on Arthur&#39;s story.





 3  Donate The Rest Of Arthur&#39;s Money To Camp 
It&#39;s Not Doing Arthur Much Good
        

RDR2&#39;s mobile camp has an ever-present donation box, which players can use to buy supplies or upgrade camp structures throughout the game. Since Arthur can&#39;t take his money with him after his last ride, and it doesn&#39;t transfer to John, he might as well donate whatever&#39;s left of it to camp. Even though the gang is falling apart, its members are on the outs, and a few of them are dead, those who remain could certainly use it.





 2  Visit The Other Gang Members&#39; Graves 
Gain The &#34;Pay Respects&#34; Achievement
        

Redditor bdpyo suggests that Arthur visit the graves of his late fellow gang members before he meets his own end. There are nine scattered around RDR2&#39;s map, and visiting each provokes some unique dialogue. Taking the time to visit all nine graves rewards the player with the &#34;Pay Respects&#34; achievement, besides being a nice little tribute to Arthur&#39;s fallen friends. If they want to mix some happy memories in there, too, bdpyo suggests visiting the old campsites as well.





 1  Leave Money For John 
Stash Some Cash At The Aberdeen Pig Farm
        

It requires an amount of foresight that Arthur shouldn&#39;t have, but with the player&#39;s knowledge of the Red Dead franchise, they can leave some spare cash for John. Redditor lelermens visited the Aberdeen Pig Farm, which John buys at the beginning of Red Dead Redemption, to give John a head start. In the first game, money is the whole reason John embarks on the quest that ends in his own death, so this could be considered Arthur&#39;s last attempt at saving him. Of course, the events of RDR1 are a foregone conclusion, but leaving a bit of cash for John could give Arthur some peace of mind.
In the end, there&#39;s no way to prevent Arthur from dying, even though RDR2 has two different endings. It&#39;s worth taking a little extra time to say goodbye to Arthur, but how the player does that is up to them. Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s final chapters are devastating no matter what, but doing a little something just for Arthur near the end can soften the blow.
