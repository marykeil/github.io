## Literature Review

Stats in GTA Online can be individually increased to create a customized character with various abilities that let you make your mark in Los Santos.





Your character has seven stats that you can level up in GTA Online: Driving, Flying, Lung Capacity, Shooting, Stamina, Stealth, and Strength. Simply playing the game will improve some of these scores naturally, but not all of them. If you want to buy the fastest vehicles, take advantage of the best weapons, or outlast your enemies, you&#39;ll need to find out the right activities to increase each stat.

The best way to level up your stats in GTA Online is to repeat the same tasks tied to improving each individual score over and over. Even if the changes seem small at first, there&#39;s no doubt that every boost to a stat will eventually cause it to reach the next stage of progression. The tasks tied to increasing every stat in the game are:
