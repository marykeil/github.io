December 5th’s Wordle answer might require players to rely on hints to solve it and keep their daily streak going.





While Wordle’s hard mode might seem challenging at first, it’s just a twist on the rules you find in the regular mode. In this mode, you cannot reuse confirmed letters in other spots, forcing you to use words that feature letters in the same spot. This can obviously be time-consuming but will let you develop strategies that you can use for future Wordle puzzles.
