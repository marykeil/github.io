## Literature Review

2024 could continue a winning streak for the PlayStation 5, and some of the most exciting games for the platform are coming early in the year.




The PlayStation 5 library continues to grow stronger with each passing year, and 2024 should be no exception to the rule. Although quite a number of games that are currently announced for the platform – especially exclusives – don&#39;t yet have set release dates, there&#39;s still a solid selection of titles slated for the coming year. From open-world action extravaganzas to unique RPG experiences, a lot of ground is covered in the slate of exciting PS5 games for 2024.
2023 was a strong year for the PS5, especially when looking at sequels or new entries in long-running series. Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy 16 were two huge exclusives for the platform, both launching to critical acclaim. Although PC users got to take the first crack at Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, it landed on the PS5 several months before it made its way to the Xbox Series X/S. Games like Resident Evil 4, Street Fighter 6, and Alan Wake 2 weren&#39;t platform exclusives, but they still helped to fill out a lineup that kept the calendar full throughout the year.
            
 
 10 Best PlayStation Games Of 2023 
PlayStation owners were given an array of amazing new games to play in 2023, with high-quality titles from big names as well as some surprises.












 








 10  Skull And Bones - February 16 
Naval Combat Action


 







Anticipation for Skull and Bones has been somewhat tempered by frequent delays and an apparent lack of some features that Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag included, but the long development cycle also means that having an actual release date in 2024 comes as a huge sigh of relief. If the troubled development doesn&#39;t show in the final product, this could be a great experience for anyone looking to sail the seas for treasure and glory. Skull and Bones is unlikely to be the ultimate pirate game overall, but it could be the ultimate naval battle experience.





 9  Helldivers 2 - February 8 
Third-Person Squad Shooter
        

Helldivers 2 is a big overhaul from its predecessor, moving from the twin-stick shooter format to a third-person view. It maintains a focus on cooperative play, however, making this an especially exciting 2024 title for anyone looking to play with friends. Helldivers 2 looks like a solid mix of robust systems, from interesting loadout customization to large maps that require intense strategizing to conquer efficiently.





 8  Black Myth: Wukong - August 19 
Action RPG
        

Trailers for Black Myth: Wukong have garnered quite a bit of excitement for this take on Journey to the West, showcasing incredible setpieces and action scenes that look like they&#39;ll make for consistent highlights across the experience. Developer Game Science hasn&#39;t released anything on this enormous scale before, which could be a cause for concern, but everything in terms of gameplay is looking good so far. Anticipation has been mixed with criticism, however, thanks to some past comments from developers that showcased questionable views on sex and other subjects.





 7  Star Wars Outlaws - 2024 
Action-Adventure


 







Star Wars Outlaws looks like it will be the first major Star Wars game to launch after the expiration of EA&#39;s license exclusivity, with Ubisoft&#39;s Massive Entertainment at the helm. If it&#39;s anything like the studio&#39;s recent Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, it could be a truly impressive look at a galaxy far, far away that&#39;s tempered a bit by tired game design elements. The appeal of a single-player open-world Star Wars adventure generally speaks for itself, and it&#39;s no surprise that this is a particularly anticipated PS5 game for 2024.

 6  Rise Of The Ronin - March 22 
Action RPG
        

Rise of the Ronin is a new samurai adventure from Team Ninja, known for the intense action challenges of games like Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. It&#39;s currently set to release as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, making it a real standout among the system&#39;s catalog for 2024. Exciting action animation, a variety of weapons and gear, and an interesting historical setting all combine to form a package that seems like a winner.





 5  Metaphor: ReFantazio - Fall 2024 
Turn-Based RPG
        

Fans of Shin Megami Tensei and Persona have good reason to look forward to Metaphor: ReFantazio, which comes courtesy of the creators of Persona 3–5. Although it&#39;s not directly connected to prior Atlus franchises, it&#39;s a turn-based RPG that shares some mechanics and doubles down on the striking artstyle and presentation that the games are known for. Considering how much of the JRPG scene is dominated by long-running series, it&#39;s nice to see something that&#39;s a fresh start in some ways.





 4  Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 - March 22 
Action RPG
        

The original Dragon&#39;s Dogma is the sort of game that comes up often in discussion of underrated titles – popular and beloved, but less widely played than the standard mega-hits. Having a release date for Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 is consequently very welcome, and it looks like it will build on the strong combat possibilities of the formula and fulfill ideas that couldn&#39;t be fully realized the first time around. Anticipation is certainly high among fans of the first game, and it stands a chance of being a real breakout hit.

A recent hands-on preview for Dragon&#39;s Dogma 2 gave a better look at how the game has expanded its mechanics and environment since the first title.








 3  Tekken 8 - January 26 
Fighting
        

2023 was a big year for fighting games, with new entries in both the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat series that met with more positive receptions than their immediate predecessors. Tekken 8 could continue that streak, with a whopping 32 characters and a promised focus on aggressive gameplay. It also seems like it could bring the Mishima saga to a conclusion with a bang, and the events of the story seem like they&#39;ll be climactic regardless.





 2  Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth - January 26 
Turn-Based RPG
        

The Yakuza/Like A Dragon series has an excellent reputation for delivering exciting and unique experiences, and Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth doesn&#39;t look like it will be an exception. The franchise always accessorizes interesting main stories with an extraordinary variety of side content, and this entry truly outdoes itself with an Animal Crossing-style affair included as one of many Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth mini-games. It&#39;s set to be the longest game in the series, so this could provide PS5 entertainment for a big chunk of 2024.





 1  Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - February 29 
Action RPG


 







The adventures of Cloud Strife and company took the world by storm in 1997, and Final Fantasy 7 Remake showed that the story is just as compelling today, even when seen through a different lens. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is riding off all the hype that Remake received and generated alike, setting it up to be the next smash hit in the storied RPG franchise. With at least a three-month window of PlayStation exclusivity, it&#39;s hard for any game to match the anticipation for this PS5 title in 2024.
