## Literature Review

According to some Version 4.4 leaks, a new Adepti is being introduced in Genshin Impact. Here’s her name and how she looks in the game.




The name and design of a new Adepti character in Genshin Impact 4.4 have been revealed through a series of new leaks regarding the upcoming patch. As a live-service title, HoYoverse’s popular action RPG constantly receives updates that bring new content into the game, be that in the form of playable characters, story quests, map extensions, or even limited-time events. The game, however, has been plagued by leaks before every new patch, which tend to detail every aspect of the next content – one of which is an important new NPC.




The new Adepti in Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks had already been mentioned as something of a deity in Liyue, but now there are further confirmations about her name and even how she looks. According to a post made by user noteggs_on Reddit, this character’s name is Fu Jin. As seen in the featured images, Fu Jin has a standard NPC adult woman body type. She wears a light green and yellow dress that fades into energy at her feet. Fu Jin has green eyes and a yellow marking on her forehead. Her hair is black, and she has feathers adorned into her hairstyle.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Xianyun (Cloud Retainer) Kit Leaks - Vision, Skills, &amp; Burst   Despite the large quantity of conflicting information, it seems like Xianyun’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact has leaked ahead of Version 4.4.

Fu Jin is referred to as the “World Quest NPC” in Version 4.4, which means she may be an important character in the upcoming patch. Previous leaks had stated that she was somewhat related to the new areas in Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks, and these new regions will be part of the Nation of Liyue.



Previous leaks had mentioned she was called Fujin, so the exact writing of her name in English remains to be seen once Version 4.4 is announced.




As a deity in Liyue, it is likely she is an Adepti, though it has not been confirmed if that will be a title of hers or if she is considered a minor deity, for instance. Though the location of the image of Fu Jin may be random, it seems like the Adepti embraces a “lady of the lake” demeanor. Not only does she have some elements of spectral presence to her, but she ultimately seems like a good fit to be present near the lake where her design was leaked.




At the moment, it is uncertain how she will guide the Traveler through one of these new areas in Liyue. However, there may be some connection between that and her own presence in the region. If the leaks are accurate, there will be a lot of content in Genshin Impact 4.4, from new areas, events, story quests, and playable heroes, to a completely new Adepti character.
