## Literature Review

Elden Ring&#39;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC still doesn&#39;t have an official release date, but one might have leaked through a brand collaboration.




Elden Ring&#39;s upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is a major source of hype for FromSoftware fans, and a new leak reveals that it might actually be releasing soon. FromSoft announced Shadow of the Erdtree in February 2023, but the studio has been essentially quiet on the subject since, with no footage or release date for the DLC ever showing up through any official channel. The newest information, however, indicates that a return to the Lands Between could happen in February 2024, one year after the expansion was originally announced.




Although it&#39;s difficult to say what exactly will be included in Elden Ring&#39;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it is possible to make some informed guesses at what it will look like. On a basic level, it seems set to be a full-fledged story-based expansion, following a previous free DLC that focused on PvP instead by opening up colosseums for competitive play. Based on the image that FromSoft originally shared when announcing the game, there&#39;s likely a focus on Malenia&#39;s twin brother Miquella, although where Shadow of the Erdtree falls in the timeline is still a mystery.

                  Elden Ring DLC: Why The Colosseums Were Built (&amp; Then Abandoned)   The three PvP Colosseums in Elden Ring, like those ancient Rome, were venues of sacred violence abandoned as the values of the Golden Order changed.   


 A Leaked Collab Cites A February 2024 Date For Elden Ring DLC 
          




The possible evidence for a February 2024 Shadow of the Erdtree release date comes from a now-deleted leaked collaboration between Elden Ring and Thrustmaster, as shown in a tweet from Wario64. Thrustmaster is a manufacturer of flight sticks, steering wheels, and more, but the company also includes standard video game controllers in its repertoire. The collaboration promises a line of Elden Ring tie-in controllers, with the first set to release in February 2024 to &#34;sync with new &#39;Shadow of the Erdtree&#39; expansion release,&#34; making a note of the anniversary timing that would mark two years since the initial release of Elden Ring.



 Leaks Point To Elden Ring DLC Or More In 2025 
          

The other interesting point from the Thrustmaster collaboration is a note on further planned controllers, which states plans for synchronization with a &#34;2025 Elden Ring major keybeat or new game expansion.&#34; This information is vaguer, and &#34;keybeat&#34; may be a new marketing addition to the English language, but it does point to the possibility of significant Elden Ring content in 2025 as well. It&#39;s possible that Thrustmaster doesn&#39;t know any specific information and is simply hoping for something to aid a marketing push, but FromSoft could have told the company that there were plans for 2025 without confirming whether Shadow of the Erdtree is the final DLC.




Seeing the highly-anticipated Elden Ring DLC soon doesn&#39;t seem out of the question based on past timing of FromSoft DLC releases. It&#39;s been a while since the company has released major expansions for games in the SoulsBorne style, but DLC for Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 came out within a couple of months of its initial announcement. There&#39;s no way to know for sure unless FromSoft officially reveals things, but the Thrustmaster collaboration does offer some hope that Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree could be just around the corner.
