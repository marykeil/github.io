## Literature Review

Buying upgrades to Sargon&#39;s items and weapons in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown helps you deal with some of the first big challenges in the Citadel.





Many of the upgrades you can apply to Sargon come from The Mage vendor in The Haven area of the Lower City or from the goddess Kaheva in her Forge. Most enhancements require Time Crystals, the main currency of Prince of Persia: TLC, but some require additional materials. Make sure to explore hidden areas in different zones on your map to earn plenty of Crystals from your travels.
One of the best ways to constantly receive upgrades in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is by unlocking fast travel. There is a waypoint located right next to The Haven that allows you to return for specific improvements quickly.











 








 7  Menolias&#39; Quiver &#43;1 
Cost: 100 Time Crystals
        

  Upgrade   Description    Menolias&#39; Quiver &#43;1   Increase the maximum number of arrows carried by 5. The quiver&#39;s capacity increases from 10 to 15 arrows.    
Menolias&#39; Bow is the second weapon Sargon unlocks after learning how to beat Erlick in the Hyrcanian Forest. Once you leave the woods, you&#39;ll start facing more flying enemies and have to solve more puzzles with arrows from the Bow. However, you don&#39;t have many projectiles to work with at first unless you buy an upgrade.
The Menolias&#39; Quiver &#43;1 improvement may not alter any stats of the Bow, but it does give you more of a resource that&#39;s initially quite limited. For only 100 Time Crystals, you can take care of more enemies in the air or use arrows more frequently in combos against Sargon&#39;s foes. Some puzzles require precise use of arrows that you could run out of before you solve them.
The Sacred Archives area demands that you hit a special bell with an arrow to create new platforms for a limited time. These platforming sections can be hard to get through if you run out of arrows.







 6  Bow of Menolias &#43;1 
Cost: 250 Time Crystals &#43; 1 Azure Damascus Ingot


 







  Upgrade   Description    Bow of Menolias &#43;1   Slight increase in Bow and Chakram damage.    
You can also improve your position with the Bow of Menolias &#43;1 upgrade, which simply increases your overall damage with Sargon&#39;s ranged weapon. Both the Chakram and Bow arrows do lackluster damage at first against any enemy that isn&#39;t normally killed in one shot. Those who boost their Bow&#39;s damage are more encouraged to use either ranged tool in combat throughout Prince of Persia: TLC.
One of the obstacles holding you back from getting this upgrade right away is the Azure Damascus Ingot you need to spend to get it. This incredibly rare material is only found in a few select locations in Prince of Persia: TLC. Thankfully, you should be able to find one in the Lower City right below The Haven and another just before entering the upper area of the Hyrcanian Forest.





 5  Dragon King &#43;1 
Cost: 125 Time Crystals
        

  Upgrade   Description    Dragon King &#43;1   One-time protection from a killing blow by restoring a Small amount of health. Regenerates at Wak-Wak Trees.    
Dragon King is one of the best Amulets to equip first in your adventure. The Dragon King &#43;1 upgrade gives you even more of a second chance in tough fights. Normally, this item allows Sargon to survive one hit that would kill him in most situations. The improvement to this Amulet affects how much health is restored once it activates.
This first upgrade is incredibly cheap compared to other enhancements bought from Kaheva&#39;s Forge, especially considering the price of other Amulet buffs. 125 Time Crystals can easily be farmed from the elite enemy and undead archers that appear in the room to the immediate right of The Haven. Walk back to the Wak-Wak Tree in the safe zone to respawn these foes over and over again for Sargon to defeat.





 4  Potion Efficiency &#43;1 
Cost: 250 Time Crystals
        

  Upgrade   Description    Potion Efficiency &#43;1   Slightly increase the amount of healing Sargon receives when you consume one of your Potions.    
Potion Efficiency &#43;1 is one of the two upgrades offered initially by The Mage vendor, and it improves the amount of Sargon&#39;s health restored when you use any of your Potions. Despite the clear advantages of this effect, you may not have many chances to use it early in Prince of Persia: TLC. This comes from the surprisingly slow rate that you can increase your total number of health bars.
Soma Petals are the only ways you can raise your max health, but these come from intense exploration or defeating major bosses like Jahandar the Manticore. As a result, even the normal amount of healing from a Potion should fully heal you most of the time, regardless of an upgrade. However, this improvement becomes stronger as you progress further through the game&#39;s main quests.





 3  Qays &amp; Layla &#43;1 
Cost: 325 Time Crystals &#43; 1 Azure Damascus Ingot


  Upgrade   Description    Qays &amp; Layla &#43;1   Slight increase in sword damage.    
Sargon&#39;s twin swords, Qays &amp; Layla, are your primary tools for every attack you make against the enemies you fight throughout the Citadel. The Qays &amp; Layla &#43;1 upgrade does what you might expect by boosting all forms of damage dealt by each sword. Air combos, attack strings, and all other forms of melee combat immediately become stronger when you purchase this improvement in Prince of Persia: TLC.
Once again, you need to find an Azure Damascus Ingot in addition to some Time Crystals to apply this upgrade from Kaheva&#39;s Forge. A video by YouTube creator Ben-Gun showcases where to find all 20 Ingots scattered on Mount Qaf in Prince of Persia: TLC. Keep in mind that you&#39;ll need to have every one of Sargon&#39;s time powers to reach the spots where some of these items are located.





 2  Blessing &#43;1 
Cost: 450 Time Crystals


 







  Upgrade   Description    Blessing &#43;1   Moderately increase max health. The additional health boost can only be regenerated at Wak-Wak Trees.    
The Blessing Amulet will give you one temporary extra health bar whenever you rest at a Wak-Wak Tree, but the Blessing &#43;1 upgrade adds another to Sargon&#39;s total. Enhancements to this Amulet are perhaps the most valuable out of all the jewelry in Prince of Persia: TLC due to this effect. Since Blessing only costs one slot on Sargon&#39;s Necklace, you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about replacing it at any point.
Keep in mind that Potions do not restore the temporary health bars provided by the Blessing Amulet, even if you have the Potion Efficiency upgrade. Only by resting at Wak-Wak Trees can you recover your extra health bars.







 1  Additional Healing Potion 
Cost: 500 Time Crystals
        

  Upgrade   Description    Additional Healing Potion   Increase the number of Potions you carry.    
The best upgrade to get first in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is an Additional Healing Potion, which gives you another healing item to use before resting at a Wak-Wak Tree. Having more chances to heal can help you against bosses and elite enemies or even just let you explore for a longer time. While it may be a more expensive investment at 500 Time Crystals, you should be able to collect the money you need from basic foes.
