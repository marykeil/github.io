# The Next Zelda Game Can Bring Back An Overlooked Link Detail


## SUMMARY 



  The Legend of Zelda&#39;s next game is highly anticipated, but details about its gameplay and appearance are still unknown, as the game hasn&#39;t even been confirmed to be in development.   Link, the iconic hero of the series, has had very little character change throughout its history, except for a change in outfit and, oddly, his dominant hand.   Link&#39;s original left-handedness in the early 3D era of the series was a unique detail, and it would be a nice homage if it were to make a comeback in the next installment.

## Literature Review

Nothing is known about the future of The Legend of Zelda, but the next game can make a minor change to Link which would honor his legacy.




The Legend of Zelda, one of Nintendo&#39;s most iconic, flagship series, is almost assuredly going to continue after its most recent outing, 2023&#39;s incredibly successful Tears of the Kingdom. With no news (or even confirmation of) the next entry, it&#39;s impossible to know what it&#39;ll look like, whether it iterates on the more recent open-world formula, embraces the series&#39; more traditional trappings once again, or breaks new ground entirely. One thing almost guaranteed, though, is that the next Zelda game will feature the series&#39; ever-present hero, Link, and even an innocuous change to the protagonist could pay homage to his past.




Since The Legend of Zelda began in 1986, Link has been the main character, and he&#39;s surprisingly undergone very little change since. He&#39;s a Hylian – complete with pointed ears – practically never talks in-game, and has traditionally worn a green tunic and long, pointed cap. In fact, Link&#39;s biggest character change in his entire history, discounting changes in art style like the radical shift to cel shading in The Wind Waker, is perhaps a new outfit, donning a bright blue tunic in his default appearance for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. While a reversion to his traditional outfit is certainly in the cards, there&#39;s an even more subtle detail that could make a comeback for the next Zelda: Link&#39;s handedness.

                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   





 Link Used To Be Left-Handed 
          

Early artwork for Link had him holding his sword in both his right and left hands, and the in-game sprites from the 2D era were inconclusive. When The Legend of Zelda made the jump to 3D with Ocarina of Time, however, Link became a definitive southpaw, holding his sword in his left hand, and his shield in his right. It was Twilight Princess that made Link right-handed, but only for the Wii version, due to a majority of the world&#39;s population being right-handed, thus holding the sword-controlling Wii Remote in their dominant hand. The GameCube version retained Link&#39;s left-handedness, and this version survives in the more modern Twilight Princess HD on the Wii U.

The Wii version of Twilight Princess was certainly the oddity in the situation – instead of creating new models and animations for Link to be right-handed, the developers just mirrored the entire game. Skyward Sword adopted this right-handed Link, as its motion controls provided the same rationale, and Skyward Sword HD kept said motion controls as an option on the Nintendo Switch. Although they both are sans motion controls (except for gyro aiming), Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom followed suit, rounding out a right-handed 3D era following the Twilight Princess transitionary period.






The 2019 remake of Link&#39;s Awakening has Link wielding his sword in his left hand.






 Left-Handed Link Should Return In The Next Zelda Game 
          

Link&#39;s handedness is ultimately inconsequential; gameplay has effectively no consequences pertaining to which hand Link wields a sword with. It is, however, a charming detail in the Zelda series&#39; history. Games overwhelmingly cater to right-handed players – practically every first-person shooter has the player character shoot like someone who&#39;s right-hand dominant. Link being left-handed in classic Zelda games was simply a unique detail, and a nice bit of representation for the world&#39;s southpaws.




Other items in the same games (Link firing the Hookshot with his right hand in Ocarina of Time, for instance) suggest he could be ambidextrous as well. Not every Zelda game has the same Link, but new incarnations of a hero destined to fight Ganon, so they don&#39;t have to have the same dominant hand either. Although ultimately superfluous, Link originally being left-handed is a fascinating detail, and a trademark of his character from The Legend of Zelda&#39;s early 3D era. Link doesn&#39;t have to be left-handed in the next installment, but it&#39;d be a nice homage to his legacy.
