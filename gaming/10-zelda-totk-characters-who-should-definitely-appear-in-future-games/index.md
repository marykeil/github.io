## Literature Review

Zelda characters often recur, and TOTK introduces a lot of fun new personalities. Here are some characters who should come back for the next game.




The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has some great characters with the potential to reappear. The Zelda series has always reused its characters, assigning them slightly different appearances, roles, and personalities across the eras. It might be better to think of them as archetypes instead of characters in the traditional sense: a variety of masks that different individuals can wear at different times, each to suit the needs of a particular branch within the Zelda series&#39; split timelines.
But TOTK (and BOTW by extension) doesn&#39;t simply recycle characters from other Zelda games - it also introduces a lot of new ones. And since TOTK makes many contributions to the Zelda series, it wouldn&#39;t be too much of a surprise to see some of its most original, fan-favorite characters recur in future Zelda games, either in the same or a similar capacity. Here are ten characters from TOTK who should make appearances in future Zelda games.
            
 
 Link Fighting Ganondorf In Zelda: TOTK Isnâ€™t Even A Fair Fight 
As difficult an opponent as Ganondorf is in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, he is arguably not given a fair fight in the game.












 








 10  Hestu 
Korok Seed Collector
        

Hestu is so much fun in BOTW and TOTK that he&#39;d make an excellent recurring character. Koroks appear in some capacity in most Zelda games, so there&#39;d almost always be a place for him by their side, wherever that may be. Even if finding Koroks and collecting Korok seeds don&#39;t come back in future titles, Hestu could play some other role - perhaps as a Korok leader, or a guardian of their forest. Plus, it&#39;d be interesting to see what new dance moves he could pull off.





 9  Pikango 
Point-Of-Interest Painter
        

Pikango appears in the unlikeliest of places across TOTK&#39;s map, always painting landscapes that direct Link to find various points of interest. He makes a wonderful guide, and could certainly serve a similar purpose in a future Zelda game. If the franchise&#39;s future is in open-world, BOTW-inspired gameplay, Link is going to need a lot of help getting around. Pikango&#39;s portaits could point him towards a variety of different activities, or send him out on a photo-taking quest to provide a visual reference.





 8  Robbie 
The Industrious Inventor
        

Zelda games are all about the gadgets, and there&#39;s often a mad scientist archetype who provides Link with the tools he needs. In the future, that might as well be Robbie, the Sheikah Slate-studying, Depths-diving researcher who debuts in BOTW and reappears in TOTK. In an upcoming Zelda game set in a different age of the series continuity, there will certainly be further gadgets for Robbie to tinker with, and new phenomena for him to investigate.





 7  King Rauru 
Co-Founder Of Hyrule
        

Although characters named Rauru have appeared in previous Zelda games, TOTK&#39;s King Rauru is the first to be described as the founder of Hyrule. It&#39;s a fascinating role, and one with infinite potential for exploration in the series&#39; future. Unfortunately, Rauru&#39;s role is limited in TOTK. He appears only as a guide during the tutorial, and then in the sparse flashbacks that appear in Zelda&#39;s Dragon Tear Memories across the map. In the future, it&#39;d be nice to see his role expanded, perhaps as part of a TOTK prequel that depicts an alternate retelling of Hyrule&#39;s early days.





 6  Riju 
Gerudo Chief


 







Riju&#39;s coming-of-age story in BOTW is followed up with a triumphant return in TOTK. She undergoes a nice little character arc in between the two games, turning from an insecure young leader to a champion of her people. She makes a great ally in battle, and, with her newfound status as the Sage of Lightning, is more powerful than ever before. It&#39;d be great to see another Riju cameo in a future Zelda game, perhaps as the brave and triumphant leader of the Gerudo, or the timeless Sage of Lightning.





 5  Tauro 
Ring Ruin Researcher
        

Tauro only appears briefly in TOTK, but owing to his excellent character design, he&#39;s become a memorable character and fan favorite. Tauro is a researcher stationed in Kakariko Village, one of many responsible for trying to decode the Ring Ruins&#39; inscriptions while keeping curious Hylians from climbing on them. Again, Tauro doesn&#39;t have much to do in TOTK, but it&#39;d be nice to see him take on a larger role in the next Zelda game. If other scientists like Robbie and Purah come back, he could work more closely with them, or find some other ancient artifact to examine.





 4  Hudson &amp; Rhondson 
Hyrule&#39;s Favorite Power Couple
        

One of the most charming side activities in BOTW and TOTK is the Hudson Construction quest line. Players must gather materials to build a small town, bringing a measure of comfort and stability to a fractured Hyrule. In TOTK, Hudson asks Link to help him find a wife, which he does in the Gerudo tailor Rhondson. They make a lovely couple, and one that&#39;s ripe for recurrence. Construction is often a factor in Zelda; new areas are often built over the course of a game, and only unlocked when they&#39;re completely finished. And with TOTK&#39;s commitment to outfit customization, there may be some new clothes for Rhondson to stitch.





 3  Sidon 
The Once And Future Zora King


 







The comely Prince Sidon immediately made waves with his introduction in BOTW, so it was no surprise to see him return in TOTK as the king of the Zora. With his friendly attitude, can-do demeanor, and boundless confidence, he makes a worthy ally, and a great candidate for recurring character. Like the Koroks, the Zora appear in most Zelda games as one of the peoples Link is tasked with helping, and Sidon always has a place among them. Whether he returns again as king, prince, or merely a devoted warrior, his reappearance in another Zelda game would be most welcome.





 2  Purah 
Ancient Tech Expert
        

Like Robbie, Purah is a scientific genius, and one of Hyrule&#39;s resident experts on ancient technology, often finding ways to turn mysterious obstacles into handy tools. In a similar way, she could appear in future Zelda games, providing important lore information to contextualize the mysterious ruins and artifacts Link encounters. Plus, with her penchant for experimenting on herself with anti-aging machines, there&#39;s plenty of comedic potential in other kinds of trials gone awry.





 1  Queen Sonia 
Hyrule&#39;s First Hero


 







Queen Sonia definitely has a place in whatever&#39;s next for the Zelda series. Like Rauru, she only appears briefly in TOTK - except she gets even less screen time, appearing solely in flashbacks. As the first queen of Hyrule, she&#39;s represented as a great unifier, and makes a heroic sacrifice in order to save Zelda&#39;s life. Sonia is a fascinating character, and there&#39;s a ton of potential to explore her background in a sequel. That goes double if it&#39;s a prequel set around the founding of Hyrule, tying in her husband Rauru as well.
No matter what direction the next game takes, there&#39;s plenty of potential for exploring these characters further in a Zelda sequel. Whether their roles are expanded, diminished, or simply repeated, it&#39;d be a pleasure to see any of these fan favorites once again. However, with little news on the horizon, it&#39;ll be a while before anyone knows which characters will return for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#39;s follow-up.
