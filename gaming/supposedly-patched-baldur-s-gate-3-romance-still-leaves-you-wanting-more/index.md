## Literature Review

The massive and extensively detailed Baldur’s Gate 3, where countless choices can be made, just patched a romance. But it’s still not perfect.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has undergone several changes to its romances and how the romance - and by extension, approval - system works. First, it was too easy to start romances, to the point that every companion wanted to be with Tav, and some had a hard time accepting that they didn&#39;t win Tav&#39;s heart. However, even after the fixes that have been implemented up to this point, not every romance in BG3 is in proper working order.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 made changes and updates across the board since its launch, and while that&#39;s led to a much smoother gameplay experience, it still isn&#39;t perfect in some aspects. However, the issues that pop up in certain romances aren&#39;t consistent, and that makes them more difficult to navigate without an official patch. In the meantime, some Tavs have gotten creative in the ways they romance - and even recruit - Minthara in a good playthrough.


 Recruiting Minthara In A Good Playthrough 
The Grove Doesn&#39;t Burn
         

At first, Minthara could only be recruited by siding with the Goblin Leaders and attacking the Emerald Grove. The only exception to this was through the use of specific workarounds to recruit Minthara in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. However, the workaround required a lot of extra steps, leading to later glitches since Minthara and Halsin weren&#39;t meant to be in camp at the same time during that version of the game. This was later patched in Patch #5, and Halsin and Minthara can coexist in camp as long as the Emerald Grove survives.




To recruit Minthara in a good playthrough, Tav, and their companions need to use non-lethal damage to knock her out in the Shattered Sanctum. Then, if everything goes smoothly, Minthara reappears at the Moonrise Towers, being scolded by Ketheric for her failure to destroy the Grove. From here, it&#39;s possible to recruit Minthara, making it so that every companion is available in a single playthrough.



 Issues Recruiting Minthara 
Bugs And Glitches Make Her Unavailable
          

Unfortunately, recruiting Minthara while doing a good playthrough doesn&#39;t always work as intended. There are multiple reports of Minthara not showing up at Moonrise Towers after she&#39;s knocked out at the Shattered Sanctum. However, the reasons as to why this is happening are left to speculation because there isn&#39;t enough consistency to pinpoint a singular cause. Instead, it seems rather random as to when this bug pops up and why. At least there are some ideas floating around regarding possible causes and tentative solutions. This means that not every solution will work in every playthrough.




                  Is Minthara Worth Recruiting In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3?   Recruiting Minthara in Baldur’s Gate 3 forces you to make morally evil decisions. Is she worth the sacrifices required to bring her into the party?   

Suspected actions that have led to this bug include taking long rests in the Shattered Sanctum, not talking to Minthara before knocking her out, completing quests related to the Goblin Camp out of order, and letting any of the Goblins in the Camp or Shattered Sanctum use the Wardrums and alert the rest of their allies. The Wardrum issue, however, might be the easiest to fix since they can be destroyed with one hit, making it impossible to call for reinforcements and alert the other Goblins and leaders. But again, this is all speculation based on various experiences and observations from multiple experiences.



 Ways To Reduce The Chances Of A Glitch 
There Is No Definitive Solution
          




With the ultimate goal of recruiting Minthara without resorting to turning evil, joining the Goblin Leaders, and raiding the Emerald Grove to massacre the Druids and Tieflings, some methods seem to reduce the risk that any bugs or glitches will pop up. First, don&#39;t allow any Wardrums to be hit to alert the Camp. This can turn temporary hostility into permanent hostility, and that can affect Tav&#39;s ability to speak with Minthara, which is another action that makes it more likely she could be recruited in the next act.

                  One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Romance Option Deserves Way More Love   Larian Studios revealed some statistics about Baldur’s Gate 3, and one romance option definitely deserves more love and attention from players.   

However, the precautions that can be taken for recruiting Minthara in a good playthrough don&#39;t end there. Completing the Goblin Camp quests in order without stopping to jump around to other quests could reduce the chances of the bug. It also helps to avoid taking a Long Rest after knocking out Minthara. This can lead to her body disappearing, and that might mean that she doesn&#39;t show up properly at Moonrise Towers or that she shows up as an NPC that can&#39;t be interacted with, which also means that she can&#39;t be recruited.




Ideally, these precautions will lead to Minthara being properly recruited in a good playthrough and, therefore, be romanceable. It&#39;s always useful to have multiple save files that can be used in case a glitch appears, allowing the party to go back and repeat a section in the hopes that it doesn&#39;t glitch out a second time. Checking Minthara&#39;s state before moving on is a good way to make she&#39;s recruitable later.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3: How To Romance Minthara   Minthara is a ruthless Drow leader who you can surprisingly romance in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, as long as your character fights within a deadly goblin raid.   

If she&#39;s knocked out temporarily, then it&#39;ll say so as her status, and that means she should appear properly in Act 2. If it says that she&#39;s knocked out, then she lost her temporary hostility and became permanently hostile. This allows for one way to check if everything went well in attempting to recruit her.



 Minthara Requires Another Patch 
Minthara&#39;s Romance Isn&#39;t Perfect
          




Minthara wasn&#39;t meant to be recruited in a good playthrough, and remnants of her original version that remain will need an official patch to truly be fixed. However, the ability to recruit her without destroying the Grove or using extensive workarounds is a good start compared to the limitations surrounding her that were present at BG3&#39;s release. Still, there are too many bugs and glitches that can prevent her from being recruited and romanced to say that the patch that added the option to recruit Minthara in a good playthrough is working as intended. As such, another patch will be needed to officially address these lingering problems.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Pros &amp; Cons Of Romancing Minthara In BG3   Every decision in Baldur’s Gate 3 comes with its own pros and cons, so how worthwhile is romancing Minthara given the requirements and consequences?   

Since Minthara is a character that is simply evil without a redemption arc, she draws a measure of intrigue, which can lead to the desire to have her as a romantic partner or just a companion. Additionally, she has a lot of banter with other companions that can be unintentionally humorous, given her serious demeanor and loyalty to her cruel goddess, Lolth. In the end, this patched romance isn&#39;t perfect, but future fixes could smooth out the bugs and make Minthara&#39;s recruitment a smooth process in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
