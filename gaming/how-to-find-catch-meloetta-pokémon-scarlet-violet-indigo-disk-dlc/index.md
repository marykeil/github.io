## Literature Review

Meloetta is one of the many legendary pocket monsters that have become available in the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC.





According to Pokédex entries for Meloetta, the singing of this Mythical Pokémon can control the feelings of those who hear it, pacifying aggressive foes. In battle, Meloetta can use its signature move, Relic Song, to switch between the Normal-/Psychic-type Aria Forme and the Normal-/Fighting-type Pirouette Forme. The first form is when the Pokémon is singing, while the second is for dancing.

Trainers who wish to encounter Meloetta will need to start the Indigo Disk in Scarlet &amp; Violet and progress far enough to travel to the Coastal Outdoor Classroom. Head east a short distance until you encounter a whirlwind of leaves. Stand directly in the center and follow the directions below to encounter Meloetta.

  Rotate your control stick in a circle until your character begins to stand on one leg and spin.   You must hold this pose for about 10 to 20 seconds before stopping.   Next, pull out the camera and press down on the d-pad 5 times to change to the Sepia filter.   Listen for a few seconds, and the music should change.   Rotate the camera around, and Meloetta should be standing nearby.
