## Literature Review

The Sniffler is a new passive mob that was added in Minecraft 1.20. This friendly creature does not spawn naturally and must be hatched from an egg.





While players are exploring to enchant their armor in Minecraft, they can find unique items in the overworld. One such discovery in version 1.20 is a Sniffler egg. These brand-new items can only be found by using the new brush tool. The Trails and Tales update focuses on archeology and discovery. For this reason, you will not find these creatures roaming the world. To find a Sniffler egg, you must learn to use the brush tool and identify the correct block.




                  10 Best Seeds For Minecraft 1.20   To experience everything new Minecraft 1.20 has to offer, you can use custom seeds to generate worlds with stunning views and lots of resources.   


 How To Find A Sniffler Egg 
         

You must have the Trails and Tales update installed before making a brush in Minecraft. You can craft the tool using one feather, a copper ingot, and a stick. To use the brush, select it from your inventory and then right-click on any block to use it. However, this will have no notable effect on anything but suspicious sand. You can locate this block by searching in a Warm Ocean Ruin. Suspicious sand will have a different texture than regular sand and possibly contain a Sniffler egg. You will need to get lucky and use the brush on the block, but there is only a 6.7% chance of obtaining the Sniggler egg.






 How To Hatch (&amp; Breed) A Sniffler 
          

In order to hatch a Sniffler egg, place it down and wait 20 real-life minutes for the mob to hatch. If placed on a Moss block, this process takes only 10 minutes. Additionally, once you have two adult Snifflers, you can feed them Torchflower seeds to make them breed, similar to Axolotols in Minecraft. This brand-new plant was also introduced in version 1.20. Snifflers will occasionally sniff the ground and dig up Torchflowers. Refine into seeds to repopulate the world with these ancient mobs in Minecraft.
