## Literature Review

Before you can catch Latios in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC, you need to unlock its encounter and find its spawning location.




                  How to Find (&amp; Catch) Latias In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC   Latias is obtainable in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disk DLC after the player has finished the main storyline of the Blueberry Academy.   




Beloved Pokémon from the series, such as Metagross, Minior, and several of the previous starters made their way into the Generation 9 games. Among them were also several Legendary Pokémon, most of which can only be caught if you complete a specific set of tasks and get lucky enough to obtain their related item. The Legendaries in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: Indigo Disk, such as Latios, have fixed spawning spots, but you will first have to unlock their encounter. Luckily, it is not too hard to get this done.


 How To Unlock Latios Encounter In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk (Latios Treat) 
          

To unlock the encounter with Latios, you will need to obtain a Key Item called Latios Treat. This item can be obtained from the NPC called Snacksworth, who shows up at the entrance of Blueberry Academy once you have completed the Indigo Disk’s main campaign. If you have Pokémon Scarlet, you will need to complete 10 Solo Blueberry Quests (BBQs) and return to Snacksworth for a chance to get Latios Treat. In Pokémon Violet, you will have to connect to other players in the Union Circle multiplayer feature, complete 1 Group Blueberry Quest, and interact with Snacksworth.






The order in which Snacksworth hands out Treats for Legendary Pokémon is random, so you may have to execute this step several times before getting the desired Latios Treat, regardless of your version of the game.






 Latios’ Location In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC 
          

Once you have acquired the Latios Treat from the Snacksworth in the Indigo Disk’s Blueberry Academy, you can head out and search for the Legendary creature. The location in which Latios spawns in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is fixed for both versions of the game. Latios can be found at the southeastern end of the lake in Area Two in the North Province, in Paldea. For reference, there is a single tree grown in the middle of a small island in the lake.



Do not forget to save your game before you interact with Latios. This will allow you to hard reset your game in case you knock out the Legendary Pokémon or run out of Poké Balls, for instance.







Latios is a dual Dragon- and Psychic-type Pokémon. If you intend on exploiting its weaknesses, it is crucial to know Latios is weak against Bug-, Ghost-, Ice-, Dragon-, Fairy-, and Dark-type moves. However, be wary of knocking it out with a single attack. Alternatively, if you want to take it slow and steady, you can reduce its HP with moves it is resistant against. Latios takes halved damage from Fighting-, Fire-, Water-, Grass-, Electric, and Psychic-type attacks in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

The goal is to weaken Latios enough to increase your odds of catching it. Applying a non-damaging status effect, like Sleep or Paralyze, can improve your chances of capture. You can also use one of your Master Balls to ensure capture without the effort of a battle or try your luck with a Quick Ball at the start of the encounter. Regardless of your tactic, it should be fairly easy to catch Latios in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after finding its location.
