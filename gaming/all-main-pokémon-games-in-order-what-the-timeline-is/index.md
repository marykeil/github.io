# All Main Pokémon Games In Order (&amp; What The Timeline Is)


## SUMMARY 



  The Pokémon timeline is based on the year each game was released, not the region it takes place in, which can be confusing.   Console distinctions are no longer reliable for determining where games fall in the timeline since there are overlaps and remakes on different platforms.   Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a core title in Generation 8, not a spin-off, and DLCs are now connected to the base game&#39;s story.

## Literature Review

The main Pokémon games have a timeline based on the release dates, which has caused confusion for players when it comes to where remakes should fall.




Currently, there are nine Generations in the Pokémon series, spanning from the Japanese releases of Red, Green, and Blue in 1996 to Scarlet and Violet in 2022. These generations create a timeline that is seemingly broken down into sections based on when each new Pokémon region was released. However, the timeline is actually based more on which year each game was released, regardless of the region the game takes place in, and this can be confusing from an initial standpoint. A way to help break down where each game falls on the timeline, including each of the Pokémon remakes, is to look at the year the game came out.




Using consoles used to be a good way to know where in the timeline games fell, but this method hasn&#39;t been so reliable since the Nintendo DS, which started hosting multiple Generations. Generations have since had an overlap on the 3DS, as well as on the Nintendo Switch, making it much harder to distinguish timelines based on the platform the games can be played on. Many older Pokémon games have become dated and no longer available on modern platforms, forcing players to find outdated systems and vintage cartridges to play them. Because of this, many of the older games are being remade for current consoles.

                  One Change Could Make Pokémon Gen 10&#39;s Open-World Games Even Better   Although they may be years away, there is already a change in Gen 10 Pokémon games that could make their open-world maps a lot better for players.   


 Pokémon&#39;s Generation Timeline Isn&#39;t Based On In Game Data 
          




Below is the currently registered timeline for the core Pokémon games according to the fandom wiki Bulbapedia. The timeline is arranged to show the Generation, the consoles the games were released on, and the year the titles hit the market. This will help players visualize where all the core series games fall in the Pokémon timeline. This doesn&#39;t include spin-off titles like Pokémon Ranger or New Pokémon Snap, which aren&#39;t part of the game&#39;s main series.

 Complete Pokémon Generation Timeline (So Far)   Generations  Years  Consoles  Games   Gen 1  1996 - 1999  Game Boy    Pokémon Red, Blue, &amp; Yellow   Pokémon Green (Japan only)      Gen 2  1999 - 2001  Game Boy Color    Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver   Pokémon Crystal      Gen 3  2002 - 2006  Game Boy Advance    Pokémon Ruby &amp; Sapphire (Gen 1 Remakes)   Pokémon Emerald   Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen      Gen 4  2006 - 2010  Nintendo DS    Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl (Gen 2 Remakes)   Pokémon Platinum   Pokémon HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver      Gen 5  2010 - 2013  Nintendo DS    Pokémon Black &amp; White   Pokémon Black 2 &amp; White 2      Gen 6  2013 -2016  Nintendo 3DS    Pokémon X &amp; Y (Gen 3 Remakes)   Pokémon Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire      Gen 7  2016 - 2019  Nintendo 3DS / Nintendo Switch    Pokémon Sun &amp; Moon (Gen 1 Remakes)   Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon   Pokémon Let&#39;s Go, Pikachu &amp; Let&#39;s Go, Eevee!      Gen 8  2019 - 2022  Nintendo Switch    Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield (DLC) Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield: The Crown Tundra (DLC) Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl (Gen 4 Remakes) Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield: Isle of Armor      Gen 9  2022 - Present  Nintendo Switch    Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (DLC) Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk (DLC)   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask      








Though it may be perceived as such, Pokémon Legends: Arceus is not a spin-off game, but a core title in the series. It is the final title in Gen 8. As of Gen 8, games are also receiving DLCs, which are worth mentioning due to how they can be connected to the base game&#39;s stories.




                  Pokémon Gen 10 Games Should Steal This From Indigo Disk DLC (&amp; It&#39;s Not The Synchro Machine)   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet does something new with its trainers. Here’s what it is, and why it should reappear in Gen 10 games and beyond.   



 The Future Of Pokémon 
          

With Gen 9 having been kicked off by the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it is now expected that the current Generation will also include at least one more release. There are a lot of rumors and hints about Pokémon Gen 5 remakes, though these titles have yet to be confirmed by Nintendo.




It is also possible that the company will try to follow up on the critical and commercial success of Pokémon Legends: Arceus and release another core game in the new format. This may just initiate a new standard for Generations of Pokémon games moving forward.
