## Literature Review

Earning every gold star in Mario Kart 8 can prove to be time-consuming and difficult, but there&#39;s a secret trick to help speed things along.





For every cup, a star must be won at 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, and Mirror mode. Winning a trophy does not always guarantee a star either, as stars are based on a point system, and trophies are based on placement. Players must earn over 54 points in the cup to obtain at least one star.






To earn three stars for a Grand Prix Cup in Mario Kart 8, players must place 1st on all four tracks. Even placing 1st in three and 2nd in one will only reward two stars for that cup since only a perfect 60 points earn the third star.

 Earn Every Gold Star In Mario Kart 8 
         

When first starting Mario Kart 8, many players may take the obvious approach by racing the first Grand Prix Cup at 50cc, winning, and then proceeding from there. Though this method isn&#39;t necessarily wrong, it will require a lot of unnecessary time that need not be wasted. However, it is worth knowing that once a higher-level Grand Prix Cup is earned, the gold trophy is automatically filled in for every level below that.




So, if a player has no trophy earned in a specific Grand Prix Cup, they can complete the cup at 150cc, earning three gold stars, and the 50cc and 100cc levels will be auto-filled with three Gold Stars and a Gold Trophy. This means that players can go through and earn three stars in every 150cc Grand Prix Cup without having to do any of the 50cc or 100cc race levels at all but still receive credit. Be sure to equip yourself with a fast setup in Mario Kart 8, as 150cc can be challenging to win.



If 150cc proves too tricky, completing 100cc is still a good time saver as it works the same way and will fill in the level below it.




Unfortunately, this does not apply to Mirror Mode or 200cc, so every cup will also need to be completed at those levels since they will not unlock the levels below them. However, this still means that each cup only needs to be completed three times instead of five. Once everything has been completed with three stars, players will unlock special rewards, including Gold items in Mario Kart 8, as well as an alternate title screen.
