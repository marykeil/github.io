## Literature Review

Developer Simon Viklund discusses 10 Chambers&#39; upcoming sci-fi heist game Den of Wolves, which was announced this week at The Game Awards.




The 2023 Game Awards ceremony was full of exciting announcements, including the reveal of Den of Wolves, an upcoming sci-fi heist game from 10 Chambers. The Swedish developer was co-founded by Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund - two of the minds behind the first two entries in the Payday franchise - and is best known for their punishingly hard horror shooter GTFO. With GTFO&#39;s content updates coming to a close, Viklund and Andersson are returning to their heisting roots.




Set in the year 2097, Den of Wolves takes players to the remote island of Midway City, originally founded as an unregulated zone for corporations to explore new technology. The title aims to go beyond the typical heists of money and valuables to larger-stakes affairs, with a sci-fi slant and thought-provoking narrative inspired by real-world company scandals and media like Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner. As with the Payday franchise, the co-op aspect of Den of Wolves is a key part of gameplay, and players will need to strategize for bigger jobs by gaining intel and tools before embarking.

                  GTFO Review: A Brutal Shooter That Strikes Pay Dirt   After years in Early Access, GTFO succeeds in providing a brutally difficult FPS co-op experience for like-minded friends and courageous solo acts.   

Screen Rant interviewed 10 Chambers co-founder and Den of Wolves narrative director Simon Viklund to discuss real-world and sci-fi inspirations, lessons learned from GTFO, and what will surprise heist fans most about the game.





 


 Simon Viklund On Den Of Wolves 
         

Screen Rant: Something I thought was really interesting that you mentioned was drawing inspiration from real world stories of corporate crime and court cases and stuff like that. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Are there any specifically that come to mind for you when it comes to Den of Wolves?


Simon Viklund: Yeah. Well, I watched this documentary not that long ago in Sweden about where we got the stainless steel countertops, and it&#39;s very in fashion in Sweden with stainless steel sort of fridges and faucets and freezers. And they started investigating, where does it all come from? And there was a factory in the north of Sweden. But this is really what I summarized in the - I didn&#39;t go into detail until about the documentary, but I mentioned that there was a factory. I took it as an example, a factory in South America that leaks chemicals into the river. That was what they were doing, because somehow steel, something in the process they required this factory and that factory was leaking this chemical into the river.
So it&#39;s stuff like that that is like, &#34;Oh, this is such a dark, dirty world we&#39;re living in,&#34; and I&#39;d like to just inject some kernel of truth. And as I said in the presentation, it becomes a commentary I guess on it because you can&#39;t do that without it being some sort of a commentary. But it&#39;s not necessarily like a statement just because it&#39;s a commentary, I don&#39;t think at least. Everything&#39;s political, obviously. But again, we are not allowing the players to take down these corporations and it&#39;s not a game where you take a stand against that.
But I&#39;d like the idea of people being able to Google details about what happens in Den of Wolves and finding out that this is built based on something that happened in the real world. And we can use the Coca-Cola versus Pepsi thing; it doesn&#39;t have to be as dark. We can use that as well, but we can go for these sort of darker stories too. And I&#39;d like to think that somehow that adds a sense of depth or realism and sort of a profound aspect of the storytelling that wouldn&#39;t be there if it&#39;s all just made up.





Yeah, like you said, just having a kernel of truth in there in general, making it much more interesting. And I love true crime and documentaries and that sort of thing, so it does add -


Simon Viklund: It&#39;s very in fashion with true crime.


Adds an extra layer of intrigue.


Simon Viklund: Yeah, exactly.


In terms of lessons that you took from GTFO - obviously it&#39;s a different style of game, at least to a point.


Simon Viklund: At least in terms of difficulty, but yeah.


What are the biggest takeaways you had from your time working on GTFO that you&#39;re applying to this one?


Simon Viklund: It&#39;s so many that it&#39;s hard to pick the big ones, but it&#39;s our confidence in a lot of aspects of game development. Again, we&#39;ve been working over 20 years with game development. When we founded 10 Chambers, the less than 10 founders combined had more than 100 years of experience making games. But still, you need confidence and to sort of remind yourself that whatever we&#39;ve done in the past was not a fluke. So it was very useful for us to find out and get confidence in the fact that we can build a brand, we can experiment and make something that is outside of the convention or make something that isn&#39;t a sequel or an existing IP. Again, like we did with Payday: The Heist, what then became the Payday franchise was being developed.
The early access thing, since that was our first early access experience, that was really important. And that&#39;s something that we&#39;ll use as the approach for Den of Wolves as well. There&#39;s a lot of little things throughout the entire development. Learning to kill darlings when you&#39;re a small team, hoping of course that we don&#39;t have to do that as much when we have more resources that we do now. And maybe we can even pick some of those things up that we wanted to put into GTFO that would work in the context of Den of Wolves and actually implement those in that game.
A lore library is one of those things. It&#39;s very hard to keep track of the lore in GTFO and we want to present it in a more digestible way in Den of Wolves. It&#39;s one of those things that makes taking in the storytelling easier on the player.





          

And something I thought was really interesting also is that you are crafting this world of in-game brands that will have recognizable aesthetics, and you can pick up on these individual backstories of corporations. You said there were over 400?


Simon Viklund: Yeah, so far. There&#39;s going to be more.


That&#39;s crazy.


Simon Viklund: Yeah, it&#39;s insane.


Do you have any favorite ones or ones that you think that are sort of the most intriguing?


Simon Viklund: We look at blue chip companies of the real world and take what they do. And maybe you just have to look at the Wikipedia page of some companies like, &#34;Oh, we can take some of their dirty whatever they&#39;ve been caught doing.&#34;


Yes, the controversy section.


Simon Viklund: And we look at that and draw inspiration from that. We have what we call the - oh, what&#39;s the word? I&#39;m the narrative director and I forgot the name we have for the 12 founding companies that created and sort of bankrolled Midway City. [Laughs] Intercom, the Intercom Confederation.
Those 12 companies obviously are going to be very important to the backstory. And even though the storylines in the game are going to be separate stories of your involvement with certain rivalries between different corporations, they&#39;re going to be independent storylines. And the way we sort of weave something outside of that is independent of whatever you do in the storylines; it&#39;s going to be by people finding out about the backstory of Midway City and about those Intercom Federation companies and the secrets of them. And then maybe in the future we&#39;ll sort of start weaving them into the storytelling a little bit more, but there&#39;s going to be a lot of conspiracies and things.
So those companies in specific I&#39;d mentioned. But yeah, there&#39;s no point in mentioning the names of any companies because your readers wouldn&#39;t know what that means anyway. But our detailed library of companies becomes a library also for storytelling, which is really cool.





You talked a lot about the different sort of influences you&#39;ve taken from everything from Blade Runner to De Niro in Heat. I&#39;m curious the elements of those influences you named that you&#39;re taking the most from.


Simon Viklund: Yeah, that&#39;s a good question because it&#39;s obviously not everything, it&#39;s often like this concept or this aspect of it for inception. It&#39;s certainly not that everything looks the same, because we&#39;re creating a city that looks very different from contemporary cities, but we are taking inspiration from that movie and from Strange Days that you can sort of let things look contemporary when you want them to. And not everything has to be like, &#34;Oh, this is a futuristic lamp post, it needs to hover or whatever.&#34; [Laughs] You don&#39;t have to go that far for every single thing and allow it to be closer to contemporary where it can be and just go for sci-fi where it serves a purpose.
And as I mentioned in the presentation, the purpose could be that it just looks cool, but for the most part it&#39;s to serve the gameplay; that&#39;s the most important thing. So it feels really good to not have an IP where it&#39;s like - we worked on a Terminator game 15 years ago and that was a dream come true. Terminator is such a cool movie, at least the first two. [Laughs] And it felt like a dream come true to be able to work on that IP. But then you realize, &#34;Okay, we need to turn this into gameplay. We need to take what&#39;s in the movie world and turn that into fun gameplay.&#34;
Now that we&#39;re creating our own IP, we have the ability to just say, &#34;What&#39;s fun gameplay?&#34; Let&#39;s put the things into it with types of enemies and whatever weapons there might be, technology that exists in the world that is conducive to a fun gameplay experience, and then create a world where the backstory and the lore and the world building supports that and explains why those things exist in the world. So we&#39;re going from inside out rather than from an outside IP and trying to put that into a game, and that&#39;s really a strength to have that creative freedom.





For players who are familiar with heist games in the style of Payday and that sort of thing where it is sort of focused on the physical commodities that you were talking about, what do you think about Den of Wolves will surprise heist fans the most?


Simon Viklund: The mind f***ery, the sci-fi concepts I think. That allows us to - it&#39;s not just for the storytelling, but for the gameplay as well, and keeping that interesting and allowing it to go beyond the sort of brick and mortar location of Midway City, which is where all of the game really takes place. But these sort of Matrix-y ideas allow us to throw the players into different locations and different scenarios, keeping it fresh for the player, but also interesting for us as developers to not just have to design Midway City, but we can make these sort of snack size experiences where it&#39;s like you&#39;re visiting someplace else.
But we can&#39;t go into detail of how that all works. But the mood video we looked at explains a little bit of it, how it&#39;s like neural networks and biological storage rather than digital storage. And that sort of neuro-engineering thing has created something that allows us to go in like Philip K. Dick directions, where it&#39;s messing with memories and human consciousness and stuff like that. And you&#39;ll be stealing money and diamonds I guess, too. But this allows us to go in different directions where we want to and open it up and make interesting heists conceptually.
