## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended will slowly start to incorporate all the content from Evolved, but Studio Wildcard plans on taking things even further. 




A ton of new information about Ark: Survival Ascended was revealed in the Ark Extra Life 2023 livestream, an annual event that celebrates the game and provides Studio Wildcard with an opportunity to present what they have been working on to the community. This year was no letdown, as while little info was revealed about Ark 2, plenty of details on what is to come for the Ark: Survival Ascended were announced.
Ark: Survival Ascended is planned to include all the DLC and expansions of its predecessor and eventually the title will be the most robust version of Ark people will have the opportunity to play. With the introduction of the Winter Wonderland event running from December 21 - January 7, 2023, more content is already being added to Ark: Survival Ascended, with even more to come over the next two years. What&#39;s even more promising is the fact that ASA doesn&#39;t only plan on replicating Evolved but will actually build on it with future content.
            
 
 Ark: Survival Ascended DLC Roadmap - All Planned Expansions &amp; Updates 
Ark: Survival Ascended is a remastered Survival Evolved in Unreal Engine 5, and is expected to gradually include all of the original’s DLC expansions.












 








 10  Old Maps &amp; Expansion Content Will Return 
Updates Until 2025
        

Perhaps the biggest news in the Ark Extra Life 2023 event was the ASA content roadmap that the developers officially revealed. This roadmap included many of the Ark: Survival Ascended&#39;s Expansion Content and DLC, including Scorched Earth, which is planned for a March 2024 release, and Ragnarok, which is planned to be introduced in September 2024. The roadmap continues, with the last planned update being Fjordur, which should be released in October 2025.
            
 
 10 Removed Features From Ark: Survival Ascended That Completely Change The Game 
Although it’s a remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, Survival Ascended has changed up some features that might make it feel like a different game.








 9  Paid Optional DLC Adventure Packs 
Additional Content Outside Of Just Cosmetics


 







In addition to re-adding the content that was released over the near-decade in which Ark: Survival Evolved was available to play, Studio Wildcard will also be introducing additional paid Adventure Packs, and they aren&#39;t just cosmetic additions. New content will include things like customizable and buildable trains, shovels to uncover treasure, new skins, cosmetics, wagons, and more. The first paid DLC will be the Frontier Adventure Pack, which will be released with Scorched Earth in March 2024.





 8  Additional New Skins 
Paid Skins As Part Of DLC
        

Ark: Survival Ascended will include new paid skins in the Frontier Adventure Pack, which features characters in Old West-style attire, complete with a cowboy/girl hat and boots. These skins will become available upon the launch of Scorched Earth along with the other optional in-game gear. A Krampus skin is also available as part of the Ark Winter Wonderland event, lending itself to the idea there will be future seasonal event skins that people can pick up for their characters.
            
 
 10 Biggest Differences Between Ark: Survival Ascended &amp; Survival Evolved 
Ark: Survival Ascended is a graphical revamp of Survival Evolved using UE5, but questions of what else has changed are worth exploring. 








 7  Event-Specific Creatures, Items, And Skins 
Brand-New Content Added Every Season
        

While special events are nothing new to seasoned Ark players, the studio is doing its best job to add more content to current and future seasonal events. This year, during the Ark Winter Wonderland event, there were a variety of new creatures and items for those participating. New creatures included Santa&#39;s Big Helper Yeti, Abominable Snowman, Pegomastax Grouch, and a Wild Rideable Reindeer. This year also included three new skins and two new emotes, lending itself to the fact that future events will be even better.
The first Turkey Trial event for ASA was released after Thanksgiving but occurred during Ark: Survival Ascended&#39;s turbulent launch period. 






 6  Additional Mods 
More In-Game Mods Are Greenlit


 







As a big emphasis was placed on the launch of ASA, the game will receive even more cross-platform mods in the near future. These will come in the form of new creatures and even different game modes as the developers update the ASA modding suite. Ark: Survival Ascended has over 120 mods already greenlit, with more to come. This will enhance the possibilities for people, especially those that enjoy playing alone or with a small group of friends. 
            
 
 Does Ark: Survival Ascended Support Cross-Platform Play? 
Ark: Survival Ascended touted complete crossplay between PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but it has also disabled it several times in the past. 








 5  Improved Server Quality 
Poor Server Quality Is A Concentration


 







When discussing the current state of Ark: Survival Ascended servers, the co-founder of Studio Wildcard, Jeremy Stieglitz, was more than blunt about the quality of the servers. According to Stieglitz on a Ark Extra Life 2023 livestream, &#34;The servers are [expletive], they run like [expletive], and their stability is [expletive].&#34; He&#39;d explain that improving the stability and performance was one of the developers&#39; primary objectives moving forward in the future.





 4  New Creatures &amp; Taming Methods 
The Fasolasuchus Is A New Dinosaur
        

The launch of Scorched Earth in March 2024 will also bring with it new creatures that the studio plans to include in Ark: Survival Ascended. One of these has already been announced as the Fasolasuchus. These dinos walk on all fours, thrive in the arid environments of the desert areas, and can burrow underground to make a unique desert mount. The Fasolasuchus will also require a different kind of tame other than a passive tame or beating it up, which will entail tiring it out before taming it.
The Fasolasuchus will also have Thorns damage, a ranged tail attack, and other abilities — potentially adding it to the ranks of the current dino meta. 






 3  New Caves And Lore 
Expansion On The Canon
        

Those who have always wanted a stronger narrative from their Ark experience may be happy to hear that the developers plan to add more content that will reveal the background on The Island. This will be hidden in secrets in the additional caves that Studio Wildcard plans on adding to ASA. This will add much-needed diversity to Ascended, especially for those who have already explored every nook and cranny in Evolved.





 2  Survival Of The Fittest (SOTF) Updates 
Everyone&#39;s Favorite Deathmatch
        

Survival Of The Fittest is being re-introduced to ASA on December 21, 2023, and is being incorporated into Ark: Survival Ascended. This game mode will continue to be updated and improved throughout 2024 and potentially beyond as the developers are committed to creating a thriving SOTF community. Rather than just a mere reboot, it looks like SOTF might be the center of renewed attention in ASA.
Cryopods will also be re-added to the game with the release of Survival of the Fittest rather than with Ark: Extinction, which has a planned release date for the fall of 2024. 






 1  Completely New Canonical Expansions 
Brand-New Content
        

Ark: Survival Ascended won&#39;t stop where Ark: Survival Evolved left off; in fact — it plans to extend even beyond what was made available in Evolved. This means that ASA will indeed build upon the canon and narrative of the Ark franchise on its own, as the new full expansion content will be exclusive to Ascended. Though little details on what is upcoming in terms of these expansions have been officially revealed, Studio Wildcard has said it would release more information in 2024.
With the planned release of Fjordur coming at the end of 2025, it should be expected that the brand-new expansion content for ASA is still a far way off from being released.
