## Literature Review

GTA 6&#39;s first trailer showcased its Florida-inspired location and the eccentric citizens that inhabit it, with many comparing them to a popular meme.




The first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 has finally been revealed as part of Rockstar Games&#39; 25th Anniversary celebrations. The trailer introduced players to a revamped, modernized version of Vice City and the wider Florida-inspired area of Leonida, along with the game&#39;s main protagonists, Lucia and Jason.




The Grand Theft Auto 6 reveal trailer is simply a teaser in terms of its story and while it doesn&#39;t give too much away, it implies that Lucia and Jason are returning to a life of crime to get through a &#34;situation&#34; they&#39;re in. However, it did heavily focus on showcasing its location and the various citizens that inhabit it, showing off the NPC variety and physics of Rockstar&#39;s new in-house RAGE engine, and many have taken to social media with the same thoughts about some of these denizens&#39; eccentric antics.

 GTA 6 Fans Are Hyped For The &#34;Florida Man&#34; Parallels 
&#34;Leonida Man&#34; Is Bound To Be A Thing In GTA 6
         




The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer featured several in-game social media videos as a way of showing the people of Leonida. While this started somewhat tame, it soon descended into complete anarchy. Some of these clips showed people mostly partying, but there were more dangerous antics such as twerking atop or hanging out of the side of moving vehicles. This footage also ended with an older &#34;neighborhood watch&#34; member in Hamlet approaching someone with two claw hammers.

Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer also showcased plenty of its wildlife, from birds to fish. The footage that most captured fans&#39; imaginations, however, involved two sequences with an alligator and an NPC. In these clips, it appears that the NPC wrestles the alligator out of a swimming pool, and unleashes it in a store to rob it. X users, Overlord Dan, Loochy, and JawsClaws all commented that such footage mirrors the &#34;Florida Man&#34; type news stories. These stories all contain someone from Florida engaging in ludicrous or irrational actions, and the joke became that &#34;Florida Man&#34; was actually one being due to this being how the news outlets would refer to the various individuals.






The &#34;Florida Man&#34; stories have become a popular running joke on the internet since appearing as a meme in 2013.





 


 


 

Such characters are a perfect fit for the world of Grand Theft Auto, which already thrives off its inclusion of bizarre and eccentric NPCs in the games&#39; open-world maps. With Rockstar also heavily satirizing areas of America throughout the long-running series, the idea that the Florida-inspired Leonida would have its own &#34;Leonida Man&#34; in Grand Theft Auto 6 doesn&#39;t seem outside the realm of possibility.
