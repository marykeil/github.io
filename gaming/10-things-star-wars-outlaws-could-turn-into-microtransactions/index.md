## Literature Review

Star Wars Outlaws has the potential to be a lot of fun, but getting too intrusive with attempts to turn it into a cash cow could ruin it for everyone.




Star Wars Outlaws promises a new single-player adventure in a galaxy far, far away, but that doesn&#39;t offer too much reassurance that it will be free of distracting monetization systems. Single-player games from publisher Ubisoft have consistently included microtransactions for some years, from minor cosmetic alterations to boosts that can affect the rate of gameplay progression. Hopefully, Star Wars Outlaws will stick to the least objectionable options, but it might be best to prepare for the worst and be surprised if things turn out better.
Star Wars games are no stranger to microtransactions, with the debacle around the launch of EA&#39;s Star Wars Battlefront 2 showing just how bad intrusive monetization can get. Awareness of the public backlash to that particular implementation should help prevent Ubisoft from pushing things too painfully far, but even without a multiplayer pay-to-win aspects, there&#39;s still plenty of room for nickel-and-diming. Some options seem fairly obvious given their track record in the company&#39;s recent titles, while others are certainly possible but more speculative in nature.

 10  Speeder Bike Customization 
Star: Wars Outlaws Transportation Tweaks


 







Speeder bike customization is a confirmed feature in Star Wars Outlaws, which makes it the perfect target for microtransactions. Although there should be plenty of ways to add a personal touch without paying, including some premium options could offer style in exchange for coin. Paid speeder bikes might feature higher-end designs as opposed to the usual scrap metal look of underground Star Wars tech, and the changes might not stick to purely cosmetic.





 9  Unique Blasters Could Be Lootboxes 
Paid Upgrades To Firepower
        

Blasters look like the weapon of choice in Star Wars Outlaws, as lightsabers aren&#39;t likely to be on the table for a protagonist with no real connection to the Jedi or Sith. Ideally, any blasters in the game could be lootable or purchasable for in-game currency, but this may very well not be the case. Charging for more effective or stylish firepower could give paying customers a leg up in combat, either through minor changes to perks or major changes to basic function and design.

 8  XP Boosts May Disrupt The Game&#39;s Balance

Getting XP is usually a balanced reward for completing story or side content in a single-player game, but monetization can provide a way to fast-track this process. The inclusion of XP boosts isn&#39;t likely to affect non-paying players in any real way so long as it doesn&#39;t have an impact on the design of general XP distribution. If the game is stingy with XP in order to incentivize purchases of boosts, however, this particular microtransaction can prove to be especially obnoxious.





 7  Different Droid Designs As Premium Content 
Unique Looks For Droid Companion ND-5
        

Star Wars is hardly Star Wars without some kind of droid companion, and that role in Star Wars Outlaws is filled by the battle droid ND-5. Like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&#39;s BD-1, ND-5 seems like a perfect target for some customization options. These might come in the form of simple recolors or more overarching design overhauls, although they&#39;re likely to keep the basic shape of his chunky droid commando body intact.





 6  Is Map Intel Worth Paying For? 
Location Information For Upgrades And Items


 







Another way to expedite progress in a less direct manner than XP boosts is with purchasable map intel, which can point out the location of specific collectibles or upgrades to save on searching. Although so-called Ubisoft Towers have traditionally caught some flak for being a repetitive method of revealing a map&#39;s secrets, they&#39;re certainly preferable to plunking down real-world money for the same results. With a number of planets to explore, Star Wars Outlaws could pack plenty of cryptic secrets into surprising areas, giving intel microtransactions a certain appeal.

 5  Paying Real Money For Imperial Credits 
Purchasable In-Game Star Wars Outlaws Currency
        

Credits can be hard to come by for those less fortunate under the Empire&#39;s rule, but offering a way to transform real cash to legal Star Wars tender could ease in-game financial woes. Purchasing credits might allow players to skip grinds for expensive upgrades without having to put restrictions on just how the money was put to use. The possibility of separate premium currencies for use in-game is also always on the table, although separate paid currencies are likely to stick to usage in menus rather than exchanges with NPC vendors.





 4  Crossover Cosmetics From Ubisoft&#39;s Other Games 
Outfits &amp; Accessories From Games Like Assassin&#39;s Creed
        

Ubisoft is no stranger to paying homage to other games under their umbrella through outfits and items, with one recent example being the Prince of Persia weapons and animals included in Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage&#39;s deluxe pack. Although license protection might make crossover content slightly trickier in Star Wars Outlaws, that doesn&#39;t necessary mean it&#39;s off the table completely. That being said, Kay Vess wearing Ezio&#39;s Assassin robes doesn&#39;t seem likely to happen anytime soon.





 3  Color Sprays For Ships &amp; More 
Blanket Star Wars Outlaws Recolor Options
        

There are plenty of ways to examine individual customization options in possible Star Wars Outlaws microtransactions, but one umbrella approach would be the inclusion of color sprays. Purchasing specific colors could allow the re-theming of anything from clothing to weapons, offering a certain appealing flexibility in exchange for a certain lack of bespoke implementation. Some neons might feel out of place in an Original Trilogy setting, but there are plenty of carefully considered options that could fit in.





 2  New Character Outfits For A Price 
Looks From Iconic Star Wars Characters


 







One approach to outfit options that would be less likely to run into a legal wall than Ubisoft crossover skins lies in looking to other Star Wars media. In the same way that an Assassin can don the robes of another series protagonist, Kay Vess could slip into iconic outfits like Princess Leia&#39;s white dress or Han Solo&#39;s ragged ensemble. Although locking these behind a paywall wouldn&#39;t be particularly appealing, fans of individual characters might be willing to fork over the cash.





 1  Ship Customization At A Cost 
Exterior Alterations To Spacecraft
        

Space flight is one major feature of Star Wars Outlaws, but the nature of Star Wars canon means it&#39;s unlikely to offer the major exterior customization of something like Starfield. Microtransactions, however, could supply a limited amount of designs or cosmetic alterations, whether in the form of something minor like decals or overall changes to structure. Third-person space views mean that a ship&#39;s aesthetic elements might be on screen quite a lot, so Star Wars Outlaws could certainly get plenty of mileage out of these microtransactions.
