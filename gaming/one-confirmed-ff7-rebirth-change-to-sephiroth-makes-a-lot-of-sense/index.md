# One Confirmed FF7 Rebirth Change To Sephiroth Makes A Lot Of Sense


## SUMMARY

Sephiroth will be playable in FF7 Rebirth, so his decrease in power makes him more balanced in gameplay.   Limiting Sephiroth&#39;s power as a playable character prevents the story and gameplay from being disrupted.

## Literature Review

Sephiroth might not be the same in FF7 Rebirth, but that could be good. Hereâ€™s everything to know about the planned changes, and why they make sense.




Sephiroth looks a little different in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but that may be a good thing. As a reimagining of the original game, the FF7 Remake trilogy makes a number of changes to its story, setting, and characters. Many of these are minor, like the gentle rearrangement of certain story events to make the plot flow better in a linear format. Others, however, are much more significant, adding a ton of depth to otherwise two-dimensional characters, and quite possibly changing other FF7 Rebirth characters&#39; fates entirely.




But sometimes, it&#39;s the smallest changes that can make the biggest difference. FF7 Rebirth incorporates a lot of new mechanics, some of which simply couldn&#39;t exist in the original version. The story tweaks required to make these mechanics sensible and functional may be minor, but they still have a noticeable impact. One tiny story change, recently confirmed by FF7 Rebirth&#39;s developers, may not be the most popular. But it allows for a new, interesting spin on one of its most morally fraught characters.

                  10 Biggest Questions FF7: Rebirth Will Have To Answer   FF7 Rebirth has a lot of pressing questions to answer, and a lot of timeline issues to resolve. Here are some plot points it needs to address.   


 Sephiroth Is Weaker In FF7 Rebirth 
          

In an interview with Game Informer, FF7 Rebirth producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that Sephiroth is significantly less powerful in the upcoming remake than he was in the original game. FF7 Rebirth will include a flashback scene that also appeared in the original game, in which Cloud, Tifa, and Sephiroth ascend Mt. Nibel to check on a Mako Reactor. Sephiroth&#39;s power puts the young Cloud to shame; it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s much stronger than his junior already, even before his attempted ascension to godhood. But while Sephiroth will still be stronger than Cloud in Rebirth&#39;s take on this flashback, he won&#39;t be quite as powerful as in the original game.






 A Less Powerful Sephiroth Makes More Sense As A Playable Character

But of course, it&#39;s this very decrease in power that makes Sephiroth viable as a playable character in FF7 Rebirth. Gameplay previews for FF7 Rebirth have confirmed that Sephiroth will be playable, although that&#39;ll likely only extend to this one flashback scene. An ultra-powerful, godlike Sephiroth would just be too easy to play - battles would last a couple of seconds at most. The turn-based combat of the original FF7 at least gives Cloud and the opposing monsters a chance to strike before Sephiroth wraps things up. With an all-powerful Sephiroth in a real-time combat version of the game, the Mt. Nibel chapter would quickly become a boring, cutscene-laden slog.

And that&#39;s not even to mention the story implications that players could inflict with Sephiroth&#39;s full power. He may not even be fully awakened by this point, but players could still probably wreak some havoc with his limited connection to Jenova. Summoning Meteor and destroying the entire planet is something that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth players aren&#39;t quite ready for at that point in the story, and so Sephiroth had to be nerfed slightly to make sense as a playable character.
