## Literature Review

2023 was good for the Nintendo Switch with many great games released for the versatile console, including Mario &amp; Zelda alongside newcomers.




The Nintendo Switch is a console that has already held on longer than the industry average for console lifespans, yet in 2023, there have been numerous titles released for the versatile system that have continued to prove its worth. From the Nintendo mascots of Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda to lesser-known titles like Dave the Diver, Switch owners had a lot to choose from this year. Many of these were also nominated and won various recognitions at The Game Awards 2023.
Nintendo generally stands out in the video game community as being more family-friendly in the majority of its games. Its many exclusive titles also help to distinguish it from the rest, and many of these Nintendo series&#39; saw success from new entries during 2023. Although not every game in this list is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, many of them are, and the others are perfectly suited to the versatility that the Switch gives between handheld and television gaming.
How we choose entries for our Best-Of Lists. 
For this List, Screen Rant has considered the critic scores of gaming aggregator Metacritic, our own reviews, and the awards each game has won. Writer Carrie Lambertsen has also applied her years of experience to critically evaluate these picks. Audience expectation and what really makes a “Best of the genre” have also been a critical factor in the creation of this article.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is easily the best Nintendo game to have come out of 2023, with its innovative gameplay mechanics encouraging player creativity alongside a deep and engaging storyline. A sequel to the Nintendo Switch&#39;s launch title, Breath of the Wild, it seems fitting that TOTK would be released on the Switch at the end of its lifespan.
