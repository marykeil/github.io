## Literature Review

The Dawning quest returns during the holiday season for Destiny 2 Guardians to complete and earn limited-time event rewards through a special Boon.





&#34;The Dawning&#34; quest starts when you visit Eva Levante in The Tower, which you can see has greatly changed with the event&#39;s reappearance. Talking to Eva begins the mission in Destiny 2, where this kind NPC asks you to spread some holiday cheer to fellow Guardians. The objectives tied to this goal will teach you a variety of systems tied to the seasonal content that some may remember from past years.






You can find Eva Levante at the center of the Courtyard area of The Tower in between where Postmaster Kadi and Master Rahool are located.




                  Destiny 2: How To Complete Altars Of Summoning   The Season of the Witch for Destiny 2 introduces Altars of Summoning, challenging events that ask you to complete certain rituals for rare rewards.

Your character has to bake Gjallardoodles for Commander Zavala, claim the first Event Challenge, and purchase an upgrade from Eva to finish &#34;The Dawning&#34; quest in Destiny 2. The first part involves using Eva&#39;s Holiday Oven, or a place where you can cook ingredients from all over the solar system. Items you find exploring worlds during the event can be baked together to create different foods.




When you initially check all the available recipes for &#34;The Dawning&#34; event, you&#39;ll see that Gjallardoodles are the only thing you can make. You are already given the needed materials to make this snack, so simply create the food and deliver it to Commander Zavala toward the edge of the Courtyard section of The Tower. At this point, open up your Quest tab for the next part of the mission in Destiny 2.

                  All Starcat Locations in Destiny 2   Guardians looking to earn the Wishbearer Title will need to complete the Familiar Felines Triumph. This is done by collecting all 14 Starcats.   

Eva will show you the Event Card, which displays Event Challenges for the limited-time season that can earn you or your fireteam rewards. These tasks offer cosmetic items, but only if you finish certain Triumphs tied to the event. Go ahead and claim the &#34;Dawn of the Dawning&#34; card to get an Event Ticket that can be used to purchase the cosmetics for your Guardian to complete this part of the quest.




The final step here is to talk to Eva again, and tell her how much joy you&#39;ve been spreading so far. She will give you Dawning Spirit, or the main currency of the event that is usually gained by finishing Event Challenges or Bounties given by Eva. You must use the Spirit to buy the &#34;Merrymaker&#34; Dawning Upgrade, which lets you collect Boons of Friendship once a day in Destiny 2.



Boons of Friendship are special consumables that reward Fireteams with additional Dawning rewards after you complete different playlist activities.




Dawning Spirit may also be used to buy Dawning Focusing, but that item will come into play later as you continue to play in the event. Simply talk to Eva again after you get the upgrade to complete &#34;The Dawning&#34; quest in Destiny 2, and unlock a brand-new mission named &#34;Cookie Delivery Helper.&#34;
