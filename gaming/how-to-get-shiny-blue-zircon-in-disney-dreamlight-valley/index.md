## Literature Review

Shiny Blue Zircon and regular Blue Zircon are rare gems in Disney Dreamlight Valley that are exclusive to one region of Eternity Isle.





Unfortunately, Shiny Blue Zircon has no applications in the game yet, other than being sold at Goofy&#39;s Stall for an impressive 2,000 Star Coins. That being said, it could very well be an important resource in future updates and why you&#39;ll want to hold onto it. Blue Zircon, on the other hand, you&#39;ll need in order to craft beautiful blue furniture for your home. Whatever your reason, if you haven&#39;t already added these rare gems to your collection, it&#39;s time to do so.




                  Disney Dreamlight Valley 2024 Roadmap: New Expansions &amp; Updates   Just because Disney Dreamlight Valley is officially out doesn’t mean the devs are slowing down. Its 2024 roadmap is full of new content.   


 Where to Find Shiny Blue Zircon &amp; Blue Zircon 
          

Shiny Blue Zircon and regular Blue Zircon can only be found by mining mineral deposits in The Lagoon subsection of the Wild Tangle biome. The Wild Tangle biome itself is unlocked following the completion of the &#34;The Sands in the Hourglass&#34; quest, which also unlocks the Glitter Dunes region. Aside from that, once you&#39;ve unlocked the Wild Tangle region, you&#39;ll already have access to the first subsection, the Grasslands.

                  How To Solve The Cave of Wonders Puzzle In Disney Dreamlight Valley   Solving the puzzles in the Cave of Wonders in Disney Dreamlight Valley will get you one step closer to finding answers about Eternity Isle.   




From The Grasslands, you&#39;ll need to pay 4,000 Mist to remove the barrier to access The Grove region. Following that, you&#39;ll need to pay a whopping 10,000 Mist to remove the barrier and gain access to The Lagoon. Nonetheless, once you&#39;ve unlocked The Lagoon, start mining mineral deposits and you&#39;ll start collecting Blue Zircon. And, if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll also get a couple of Shiny Blue Zircon to drop.



The mineral deposits, once depleted, will respawn after five minutes.




Aside from Blue Zircon and its shiny variant, you can also come across minerals such as Amber, Zinc, Coal, and more from The Lagoon. Even better, you can get a Piranha from The Lagoon region, among other resources. So, while it may be expensive to unlock, The Lagoon region is well worth the investment in Disney Dreamlight Valley.
