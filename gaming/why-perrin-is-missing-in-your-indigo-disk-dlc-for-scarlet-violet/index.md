# Why Perrin Is Missing In Your Indigo Disk DLC For Scarlet &amp; Violet


## SUMMARY 



  Some players who have started The Indigo Disk may notice that an important NPC, Perrin, is missing.   Perrin will not appear in The Indigo Disk unless her quest in The Teal Mask has been completed.   Leaving Perrin&#39;s first quest incomplete makes it impossible to catch certain, rare Pokémon in The Indigo Disk.

## Literature Review

Although Perrin is an important character in The Indigo Disk, some players may not be able to find her, cutting off access to certain rare Pokémon.




Progressing through The Ingido Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is relatively straightforward, but some players may be missing one important character - Perrin, who&#39;s first appearance was in The Teal Mask. A photographer whose side quests grant access to rare and powerful Pokémon, Perrin is an important part of both DLCs for any player looking to fill out their Pokédex and make powerful new additions to their team. For some players, however, Perrin may not be appearing in The Indigo Disk for reasons that are relatively unclear.




Adding to Scarlet and Violet&#39;s powerful roster of Paradox Pokémon, The Indigo Disk introduces new version exclusives - Gouging Fire and Raging Bolt for Scarlet, and Iron Boulder and Iron Crown for Violet - rounding out the Paradox versions of the Legendary Beast trio and the Swords of Justice (sans a Paradox version of Keldeo). To actually catch these Paradox Pokémon in-game, however, players have to progress through Perrin&#39;s quest, which involves filling out the Blueberry Pokédex to at least 200 entries. And while completing the quest itself isn&#39;t hard, players who weren&#39;t thorough in completing The Teal Mask will find Perrin missing from The Indigo Disk.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 Perrin&#39;s Teal Mask Quest Has To Be Completed Before Indigo Disk 
         




Perrin won&#39;t appear in The Indigo Disk until players have completed her previous quest in The Teal Mask, which similarly involves filling out the Kitakami Pokédex to 150 entries. Once players have fulfilled the first condition, Perrin will challenge them to a battle and, upon the player&#39;s victory, ask for their help in photographing the rare Bloodmoon Ursaluna in the Timeless Woods. After a short sequence where the player must photograph some different Pokémon, the Bloodmoon Ursaluna will be found, leading to a battle where players can catch it. After another short dialogue with Perrin, she&#39;ll gift the player with a Hisuian Growlithe and a Choice Scarf, completing her Teal Mask quest and allowing her to appear in The Indigo Disk.



 The Indigo Disk Doesn&#39;t Explain Why Perrin May Be Missing 
          




For players who haven&#39;t thoroughly completed The Teal Masks&#39;s Pokédex, it can be hard to find out why Perrin isn&#39;t present in The Indigo Disk - especially since the game doesn&#39;t indicate that Perrin&#39;s quest is necessary for obtaining the new Paradox Pokémon. Luckily, the steps for completing Perrin&#39;s quests in The Indigo Disk are even more straightforward, as upon reaching 200 entries in the Pokédex, Perrin will simply show pictures of the new Paradox Pokémon and tell players to go and catch them in Area Zero - although she will reward a unique Sport Ball for those who bring the caught Pokémon back for her to take a picture of.

For any player looking to thoroughly complete both The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, Perrin&#39;s quests are vital for getting the chance to capture rare Pokémon that can&#39;t be found otherwise. However, for players who might have rushed through the first DLC, Perrin&#39;s quest in the second won&#39;t become available without going back to complete the hunt for Bloodmoon Ursaluna. Once that quest is complete, her second quest in The Indigo Disk will grant access to some of the most novel Pokémon added to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
