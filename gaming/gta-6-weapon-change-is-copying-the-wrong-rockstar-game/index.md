## Literature Review

GTA 6 has endured an endless barrage of leaks; however, a recent rumor is not only plausible but could be a great addition to the upcoming game.




The latest in a seemingly endless string of leaks concerning GTA 6 seems to suggest that the anticipated and long-awaited sequel to GTA 5 will have some major weapon changes that source inspiration from previous Rockstar Games projects - specifically Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Though developer Rockstar Games has remained tight-lipped on the vast majority of leaks, refusing to comment on anything other than to confirm the game is in development, these latest rumors, leaked in late 2023, appear to indicate that the GTA franchise&#39;s long-implemented weapons system and gunplay are in for a monumental overhaul. While some are unquestionably for the better, others are potentially troubling.




The latest series of leaks are twofold. Firstly, the suggestion that GTA 6 will copy the gunplay of Max Payne 3, and secondly, that GTA 6 will massively change the franchise&#39;s infinite inventory weapons system, adopting a more realistic weapon-carrying capacity as seen in Red Dead Redemption 2. While these leaks are currently only rumors and have been met with a mixed reception from GTA fans, a well-reputed Twitter user, specializing in all things Rockstar games, has reported their authenticity, noting that the inventory/weapon hosting in GTA 6 will be similar to how it is in Alan Wake 2.

                  GTA 6 Needs To Refocus The Series On Actual Grand Theft Auto   GTA 6 should do right by the series&#39; namesake and have carjacking be more than a simple, mostly useless mechanic, making cars more important.   


 The Latest GTA 6 Leak 
GTA 6 Gunplay May Be Influenced By Max Payne 3
          




One of the most startling revelations from the latest series of GTA 6 leaks concerns the game&#39;s gunplay. Rumored to be adopting many of the relevant gun gameplay mechanics from Max Payne 3, GTA 6 may feature a notable divergence in combat from previous games in the popular GTA series. Though this development may come as a shock to franchise veterans, the GTA series is not unfamiliar with large change; moreover, if the leak is correct, the transference of Max Payne 3&#39;s gunplay into GTA 6 could be an exciting and entertaining new take on the prosaic first-person shooter elements of the previous GTA games.

                  Forget The Hype, GTA 6 Leaks Don&#39;t Even Matter Anymore   GTA 6 leaks are the most prominent in history, but for a series as lauded as Grand Theft Auto, the leaks aren&#39;t likely to have a negative impact.   

Though leaks are seldom, if ever, confirmed by GTA 6 developer and publisher Rockstar Games and, therefore, should be taken with a pinch of salt, the prospect of an overhaul of the status quo GTA gunplay is one of the most significant rumors yet to be leaked. Though GTA 6 leaks pop up on a seemingly daily basis, this one, in particular, seems to be getting many fans of the franchise very excited - primarily as, unlike many of the other leaks, not only is this leak not outlandish, but, if true, it could be a great move from Rockstar Games for the companies highly hyped and eagerly anticipated upcoming game.






 Max Payne 3&#39;s Gunplay Might Suit GTA 6 
Rag Doll, Slo-Mo, And Other Max Payne Gunplay Idiosyncrasies In GTA 6
         

Though not universally beloved, Max Payne 3&#39;s gunplay is incredibly satisfying and visually spectacular. Although it is hard to imagine it in previous GTA games, GTA 6 could be designed to suit this idiosyncratic form of combat - having the ability to engage in a firefight with Rag Doll mechanics, Slo-Motion, and many of Max Payne 3&#39;s other gunplay mechanics sparingly could be a perfect fit for the upcoming game. Furthermore, while the shooting in GTA 5 and, to a lesser extent, Red Dead Redemption 2, felt occasionally slow and very clunky, the gunplay in Max Payne 3 has a charming, almost arcade-esque, feel - a potentially great fit for GTA 6.

                  10 Top Improvements GTA 6 Should Have Over GTA 5   Set to be released over a decade after its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto 6 needs to be a vast improvement if it is going to live up to the hype   




These recent leaks are potentially very exciting for fans of the GTA franchise. By repurposing Max Payne 3&#39;s gunplay, Rockstar Games could remove one of the most persistent complaints that surround many previous GTA titles - the substanceless and occasionally boring shooting. While GTA gunplay can be somewhat lousy, Max Payne 3&#39;s shootouts are nearly always intense, impactful, and impressive. With the shadow of the critically and commercially lauded GTA 5 to escape from, GTA 6 needs to innovate on the GTA formula. These are enormous shoes to fill; however, if this leak is accurate, this may be one way GTA 6 can improve upon its critically revered and best-selling predecessor.



 Rockstar May Also Take Inspiration From Another Game 
Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s Arsenal Limitations Could Restrict Carrying Limit In GTA 6
          

Beyond the rumors of GTA 6&#39;s similarity with Max Payne 3, it has been confirmed on Twitter by noted source of Rockstar-related news, Rockstar Universe, that GTA 6 will supposedly copy Red Dead Redemption 2 in one key way - a limitation on carryable inventory and weapon hosting. In Red Dead Redemption 2, this restriction made players carefully select their weapons and forced them to use saddlebags if they planned on bringing more. In all GTA games up to the present, the player was in the fortunate position of having an endless supply of weapons at all times; however, this incredibly unrealistic gameplay mechanic may be a thing of the past.





 

Though Rockstar Universe&#39;s tweet was met with consternation from certain fans who want the restrictions of reality to stay away from GTA, others are excited by the prospect of a GTA game with a heightened level of challenge and realism. In the comments of their tweet, Rockstar Universe explains that weapon hosting will be upgradeable through the use of duffel bags and the player&#39;s vehicle&#39;s trunk. Though it is unclear how this will affect single-player or multiplayer modes, the addition of inventory management concerns could make GTA 6 a deeply realistic experience, along the lines of Red Dead Redemption 2 - a game that was critically lauded for its intense realism.
