## Literature Review

An entirely new Adepti may make their debut in Genshin Impact 4.4, which goes in line with a series of other important leaks regarding the patch.




A new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak is hinting at a new Adepti character being introduced to players. Version 4.4 is expected to arrive in late January 2024, but there have already been several leaks about the update. One such example is Cloud Retainer’s release date in Genshin Impact, which is expected to coincide with an important event that is allegedly scheduled for the upcoming patch. These leaks have even started to reveal some details about how Cloud Retainer’s kit will work, without going into detail but giving enough information to speculate on how she operates.




There have also been mentions of a new pair of areas in a beloved region and even a set of new skins for players to obtain – one of which is expected to be free, while the other two are premium products in the store. Although leaks should always be taken with a grain of salt, the latest Genshin Impact leaks have been quite consistent and reliable. Navia’s leaked gameplay kit, for instance, was proven to be accurate following her official reveal by HoYoverse. Now, leaks have mentioned a new Adepti, a deity from the region of Liyue.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: New Skins May Be The Most Beautiful So Far   According to leaks, Genshin Impact will introduce two new skins in Version 4.4 - and they have the potential to be the most beautiful ones so far.

According to a bit of information shared by the leaker known as Foul, later posted on Reddit, players will encounter a new NPC. The leak indicates that the character will be female and will be called Fujin. Foul’s leak also mentions that Fujin is a “minor deity” of the area known as Chenyu Vale. As a deity, it is likely that Fujin is an Adepti, considering that deities in Liyue embrace that mantle. The leak also says that Fujin resides inside a Teapot Realm.

So far, Chenyu Vale has only been discussed in the game, but players were unable to visit it. It seems, however, like this will change, as there will be new areas in Genshin Impact’s Liyue region, according to a few Version 4.4 leaks. One of these areas is, allegedly, Chenyu Vale. This makes sense since Chenyu Vale is expected to be northwest of Qingce Village and the leaks point to the two new areas being located precisely there.




Liyue is expected to be the main focus during Version 4.4 according to the abundance of related leaks. Not only is Liyue getting two new areas, but a new Adepti related to these areas may be introduced. Cloud Retainer is also expected to arrive with Version 4.4, along with skins for three Liyue characters. On top of that, it is also expected that the annual Lantern Rite Festival will be held in Genshin Impact 4.4, which may as well be the reason why Liyue is getting so much attention in the upcoming patch.
