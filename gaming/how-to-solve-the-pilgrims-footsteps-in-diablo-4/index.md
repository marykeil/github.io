## Literature Review

One of the new quests found in Diablo 4 Season 2 is called The Pilgrim&#39;s Footsteps, which asks you to solve a small puzzle for a chest full of loot.





Your character will have this quest come up when you pick up an Old Book item that says &#34;Walk the road of faith to a lone desert chapel. Stand at Acarat&#39;s feet, follow his example, and be rewarded.&#34; This marks a spot on your map of Sanctuary, leading you to a small temple in Kehjistan. The location is to the north, close to the Amber Sands area on the roof of the Tomb of the Saints dungeon in Diablo 4.




                  10 Diablo 4 Dungeons With The Best Rewards   Dungeon crawlers like Diablo 4 are fun for mowing down mobs in dungeons and getting some great loot. Here are some places to try for the best gear.   


 The Pilgrim&#39;s Footsteps Puzzle Solution in Diablo 4 
          

The solution to &#34;The Pilgrim&#39;s Footsteps&#34; quest puzzle is to use the &#34;Follow&#34; emote next to the statue of Acarat. This is similar to the Secret of the Spring riddle in Diablo 4, where your character had to perform a specific emote to reveal a hidden chest. The monument in the area marked by this quest follows the same pattern, asking you to equip the right expression onto your communication wheel.



Make sure you are close enough to the statue before using the &#34;Follow&#34; emote if you already have it equipped. If you don&#39;t see anything happen the first time you make this expression, simply get right next to the statue.







Press &#34;E&#34; to bring up your emotes, or Up on your D-Pad if you are using a controller, then select the option that allows you to Customize your wheel of options. Swap out any of your selected emotes with &#34;Follow&#34; before using that expression in front of the statue. You should see a Boon for the Faithful chest appear in front of the sarcophagus to the right of the statue, giving you plenty of rewards.
