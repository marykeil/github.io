## Literature Review

In Lego Fortnite, players can build the Village of their dreams, but they will need some extra resources to make it a sprawling settlement.





One of the things players will have to do is recruit villagers in LEGO Fortnite, which will entail upgrading your village to be able to house more and more of them. This will come with several requirements and demands, but once the village is fully upgraded, you will have a large settlement with many options for where to go. This is also the main way you will be unlocking recipes and getting help from the Villagers you have recruited, so if you do not want to do everything yourself, this is the way to do it.

 Best Upgrades For a Village In LEGO Fortnite 
          

To begin upgrading a village, you first have to have one. When completing the tutorial, you will have to build a campfire and a simple shack, which will unlock the ability to build the Village Square once the tutorial is complete. Doing so will require 10 Wood and 10 Granite to begin your LEGO Fortnite Village life.

You can then go to the Village Square to interact, customize, and make changes to your Village, including upgrades and villagers. You want to increase your Village Rating to upgrade your Village. This will include building more and different things, as diversity will count more toward your Village Rating. This can be tracked by the progress bar in the top right of the HUD in LEGO Fortnite.




Interact with the Village Square again once the progress bar is full, and you can see the next upgrade available. You can see the requirements necessary and the rewards of the upgraded Village. The requirements will usually be building materials, such as marble in LEGO Fortnite, that can be found by exploration. It will not list what build recipes will be unlocked, but some will be given to you when the Village is upgraded.



This chart is based on information from the beginning of the game in the Grasslands Biome, and the requirements and rewards may be different in other biomes and may change as the game continues to be updated.
