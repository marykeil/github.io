## Literature Review

Discover the best Commander decks to ensure a win in Magic: The Gathering, whether it be through combo, durdle, or more creative options!




When it comes to buying and building the best Commander decks in Magic: The Gathering sure to guarantee a win, turning to the most played and powerful strategies tends to be the best approach. Introduced on June 17, 2011, the mega-popular Commander format, also known as Elder Dragon Highland (EDH), adopts a gameplay mechanic developed by Adam Staley in the 1990s and Sheldon Menery in the 2000s. The format consists of players using 100-card decks, with each card (minus basic lands) appearing only once. Players opt for a legendary creature or Planeswalker to command their army, and enter the battlefield using the Command Zone.
In 2011, five Precon Commander decks were introduced, with each deck built around an MtG Commander and a specific mechanical theme. While these are great entry points into Commander, however, they are often built sub-optimally and require a lot of tweaks to fix. Another option is to simply eschew the Commander Precons and jump right into the most played Commander strategies in the format - we&#39;re using the always great EDHREC.com as our primary source for this data - while also planning out a budget on top of this.

Screen Rant unveils our TWO exclusive Commander Masters preview cards and discusses them &amp; the set with Gavin Verhey.












 








 10  Shorikai, Genesis Engine 
        

Shorikai, Genesis Engine is the most popular Commander for the vehicles strategy, which sees decks play the powerful artifacts (and creatures, when crewed) alongside enablers like cheap creatures to crew them and synergistic removal and disruption. Shorikai is a U/W deck which means players have access to many options to fill out their curve alongside vehicles; counter magic like Dovin&#39;s Veto and Counterspell are appealing, while white cards like Refurbish can help reanimate target artifacts to control the battlefield. Important cards to consider for Shorikai are Imposter Mech, Mobilizer Mech, and Parhelion II.





 9  Edgar Markov 
        

Edgar Markov is the king of the Vampires typal Commander deck. It&#39;s easy to see why - he has the powerful Eminence ability, which triggers even when he&#39;s in the Command Zone to pressure board states. There are options with Edgar Markov - Vampires swarming the battlefield can be the main goal or a sub-theme, with the latter playing second fiddle to life gain combos that can end the game on the spot. Important cards for Edgar Markov are Edgar, Charmed Groom; Vito, Thorn of Dusk Rose; and Drana, Liberator of Markir.

 8  Kenrith, the Returned King 
        

Ah, Kenrith. A card that once terrorized Standard as part of an extremely efficient ramp strategy has now come to Commander for an equally impressive reign of terror. Kenrith is most popular as a Pod-style commander - which means strategies that sacrifice smaller creatures to bring more powerful ones onto the battlefield for free, or for a discount. Kenrith also has a 5-color mana identity which means players can add pretty much whatever they want to their strategy. Crucial cards for any Kenrith deck are Birds of Paradise, Smothering Tithe, and Rhystic Study to help ramp out and cycle through its more niche cards and counters.





 7  Wilhelt, the Rotcleaver 
        

Shockingly, the zombie warrior Wilhelt is, in fact, a Zombie typal Commander card, and a good one at that. Wilhelt produces an endless stream of zombies and also card draw with his secondary ability, which means he&#39;s entirely self-sustaining as a Commander. Just like their best B-movie horror counterparts, MTG zombies are at their best in a group, slowly ammassing a lethal horde. Gisa and Geralf; Hordewing Skaab; and Midnight Reaper are just some of the must-includes for this fun and competitive thematic strategy.

 6  Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm 
        

Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm is one of two dragon Commanders who will grace this list of the most popular, competitive Commander strategies. Miirym is a fairly cheap dragon in the Temur colors that has an incredibly powerful ability, creating tokens of other dragons that enter the battlefield under your control while Miirym is there. This can create some huge board swings given the general impact of MTG&#39;s best dragon cards, and the deck must include some of them: Earthquake Dragon, Old Gnawbone, and Terror of the Peaks are just a few that should definitely be considered.





 5  Yuriko, The Tiger&#39;s Shadow 
        

Yuriko, the Tiger&#39;s Shadow embraces one of MTG&#39;s most exciting mechanics: ninjutsu. The old-school Kamigawa ability allows players to return an unblocked attacking creature to hand and replace it with a ninja card that&#39;s already tapped and attacking, usually with an ability that triggers immediately after dealing damage. Yuriko triggers a draw effect that also damages each opponent every time any ninja deals damage to a player, and also has Commander Ninjutsu, which allows players to put her into play from the command zone directly into the battlefield attacking. Yuriko decks want very cheap, evasive threats to turn into more expensive game-ending ones, so a combination of cards like Faerie Seer and Slitherblade goes nicely with Fallen Shinobi and Sakashima&#39;s Student.

 4  Isshin, Two Heavens As One 
        

Isshin, Two Heavens As One is a powerful Mardu samurai Commander who features prominently in two different themes: samurai typal or equipment. Both strategies take advantage of his incredibly strong static ability, which states that, while he&#39;s in play, any permanent that triggers from a creature attacking triggers twice instead. While there are differences in his two most popular strategies, they do tend to share a similar blend of the best equipment and creatures for Isshin&#39;s static: cards like Sword of the Animist; Etali, Primal Storm; and Hero of Bladehold are just a few to consider.





 3  Lathril, Blade of the Elves 
        

Lathril, Blade of the Elves is a fairly new Commander that totally reinvigorated elf typal strategies. Lathril has a bit of evasion with the menace keyword, and when Lathril deals combat damage to a player, it creates that many 1/1 elf tokens. This helps fuel the major payoff for running Lathril: players can tap 10 untapped elf creatures they control to make every opponent lose 10 life and have the Lathril player gain 10 life. For that reason, it&#39;s important to build a Lathril deck with a lot of small elves and synergies to help protect or pump them: cards like Elvish Mystic, Llanowar Elves, and Elvish Warmaster are all great examples of the combination of ramp and little creatures that make this deck function so well.

 2  The Ur-Dragon 
        

The Ur-Dragon is a 5-color Commander with the Eminence keyword, which reduces the cost of all dragon spells by 1. It allows players to put every color of dragon in their deck to maximize power levels, and cost reduction is always powerful in the context of Magic: The Gathering. On top of that, The Ur-Dragon has an incredible ability when its in play: whenever one or more dragons attack, the Ur-Dragon&#39;s controller draws that many cards and then can put a permanent card into play from their hand. This can be any permanent, so it doesn&#39;t have to be drawn of the effect, and can cheat into play another gigantic dragon. Some major players in this deck could be: Decadent Dragon, Dragonlord Dromoka, and Dragon&#39;s Hoard.





 1  Atraxa, Praetors&#39; Voice 
        

Despite the card&#39;s disturbing art, Atraxa is arguably the most powerful Commander in Magic: The Gathering. Atraxa, Praetor&#39;s Voice is armed with Flying, Vigilance, Deathtouch, Lifelink, and the ability to Proliferate at the end of turn. That alone would nearly allow the Commander to defeat the game single-handedly, but the four-color deck (red is absent) is better defined by its Proliferate mechanic, which bolsters its potency through counters. Cards like Flux Channeler, Cankerbloom, and Deepglow Skate all help Proliferate even more, and then it&#39;s just a matter of choosing a win condition: overwhelming the board with Planeswalker ultimates, dealing infect damage to shorten the amount of damage needed down from 40 to 10, or more.
