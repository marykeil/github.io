## Literature Review

To acquire Toastie in Vampire Survivors, players will need to slay one of two specific mob types found within the third and fourth stages of the game.





To unlock Exdash, go to the title screen and type &#34;x-x1viiq.&#34; Make sure you type this code accurately, and you will hear a chime once it has been registered. Now that Exdash has been unlocked, you will need to defeat the Stalker or Drowner minibosses. This is the same method for unlocking Smith IV in Vampire Survivors and can be completed in the Dairy Plant, Gallo Tower, or the Bone Zone. It is recommended to slay the Stalker within the Dairy Plant, as the location offers the most manageable method of beating the miniboss.

 How To Get Toastie In Vampire Survivors 
          

You can access the Dairy Plant by reaching Level 40 in Vampire Survivor&#39;s Inlaid Library. At the beginning, the Stalker has a 1% chance to spawn, but at the 8-minute and 12-minute marks, the Stalker has a 30% chance of spawning on the map. 



If the Stalker has not spawned after 12 minutes, players are advised to quit Dairy Plant and start over.




Once the Stalker spawns, you can attack the miniboss with Pentagram, Gorgeous Moon, or Rosary, provided you have evolved your weapons in Vampire Survivors. This will cause it to disappear and drop a chest. You can also use the minecarts to kill the Stalker more efficiently and reliably. Once the Stalker has been defeated, Toastie will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen for several moments while yelling &#34;Panini.&#34; Press the Down (â†“) and &#34;Enter&#34; keys as quickly as possible. A chime will sound when done correctly, indicating that Toastie has been successfully unlocked in Vampire Survivors.
