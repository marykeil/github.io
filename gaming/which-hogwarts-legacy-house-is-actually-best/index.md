# Which Hogwarts Legacy House Is Actually Best


## SUMMARY 



  Joining Hufflepuff in Hogwarts Legacy offers an exciting and unforgettable experience, with exclusive access to the notorious prison Azkaban.   Ravenclaw is the worst House in the game, lacking interactive companions and limited interactions with Amit Thakkar.   While a player&#39;s House choice doesn&#39;t drastically impact the main storyline, choosing Hufflepuff allows for the best gameplay experience and the opportunity to explore Azkaban.

## Literature Review

Although each House offers a unique experience, one Hogwarts Legacy House stands out as the best from a gameplay standpoint (and one as the worst).




Hogwarts Legacy is no stranger to the age-old House debate from the main Harry Potter series - but a couple of in-game factors actually cement one particular House as the best of the four (and one House as the worst). Joining the best House will grant players an exciting, unforgettable experience, regardless of whether they&#39;re longstanding Harry Potter fans, or completely new to the franchise. On the other hand, joining the worst House can leave one feeling underwhelmed and regretful of their choice, especially if they make this mistake on their first playthrough of Hogwarts Legacy.




Per canon tradition, though, there is a way for students to be sorted into a House based on their personalities. Taking the Wizarding World franchise&#39;s official online quiz can let players be sorted into a Hogwarts Legacy House before they even log into the game. In Hogwarts Legacy itself, there is also a short series of questions that the sorting hat will ask to determine where the main character should be placed. But for those who aspire to be a part of the game&#39;s most worthwhile House (and to avoid the most lackluster option), there&#39;s a clear path to follow.

 Hufflepuff Is The Best House In Hogwarts Legacy 
          




The best House in Hogwarts Legacy is Hufflepuff. Students belonging to this group – whether through choice in Hogwarts Legacy or sorted into Hufflepuff by the Wizarding World quiz – are said to be undyingly loyal, hardworking, and fair. Not only that, but in-game, Hufflepuff players are the only ones able to access Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy thanks to their House-exclusive side quest. This notorious prison is home to some of the wizarding world&#39;s most dangerous criminals and creatures, and it has some serious significance in Harry Potter lore. Missing out on this iconic location in Hogwarts Legacy can be a bummer for Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin students, especially since their House-exclusive quests take place within castle grounds.

 Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Worst House Is Ravenclaw 
          

Even if a player isn&#39;t interested in visiting Azkaban with Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s best House, Hufflepuff, there&#39;s still one House that they should avoid choosing lest they wish to miss out on a crucial gameplay feature. Ravenclaw, the House of wisdom and creativity, has the least interactive companion. Gryffindors can be accompanied by the brave and thoughtful Animagus, Natsai Onai; Slytherins can get the help of the sneaky and charismatic Sebastian Sallow; and Hufflepuffs can enjoy the company of the kind and knowledgeable Poppy Sweeting. Meanwhile, Ravenclaws have only Amit Thakkar.

Amit Thakkar is a prominent character in Ravenclaw, but unlike the other Hogwarts Legacy companions, interactions with him are quite few and far between. His available story is tied to main quests that do not unlock any unique or special achievements that are specific to Ravenclaw, although his quests &#34;Astronomy Class&#34; and &#34;It&#39;s All Gobbledegook&#34; will unlock Astronomy Tables in the Highlands for rewards.






Each of the four companions can be interacted with, regardless of the player character&#39;s House, and the player will therefore have access to all the storylines and rewards associated with each.




At the end of the day, a player&#39;s House is a deeply personal choice, and those who wish to identify in-game as they would in real life should feel free to do so. Apart from differences in the common rooms, exclusive quests, and companions, Houses don&#39;t have a drastic impact on the main storyline. That being said, from a gameplay standpoint, Ravenclaw can leave players feeling lonely and disappointed due to not having much interaction with its class companion. When looking for the best House in Hogwarts Legacy, Hufflepuff rises above the pack thanks to its exclusive ability to explore Azkaban.
