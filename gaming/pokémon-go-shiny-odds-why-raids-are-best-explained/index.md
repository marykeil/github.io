## Literature Review

Shiny odds in Pokémon GO work very differently compared to the rates in the mainline series. There are a few factors that make them so different.





The mainline series of video games features numerous aspects that can be manipulated by players to improve the odds of finding a Shiny Pokémon. These have been fine-tuned over the history of the franchise based on player feedback as it makes sense for each game. On the other hand, the odds of finding a Shiny in Pokémon GO can’t be affected by the trainer. Shiny rates in Pokémon GO can fluctuate, with special events such as Pokémon GO’s Community Days having increased spawn rates for Shiny Pokémon appearances, and some raids and quests resulting in better chances.




                  Pokémon GO&#39;s Trading Problem Makes Shiny Hunting Even Worse   Pokémon GO’s social and long-distance features have been improved over the years, but trading is still a problem – especially for shiny hunters.   


 Pokémon GO&#39;s Shiny Odds Explained 
         

Pokémon GO relies on a random number generator (RNG) system for determining if Pokémon found in the wild or encountered at the end of a raid will be Shiny, and each is determined uniquely for each player, meaning the same Squirtle seen by two people may be Shiny for one and not for the other. Although the Pokémon GO community network, The Silph Road, shut down its website operations in 2023, an archive of Shiny odds calculated by The Silph Road still makes for the most exhaustive resource on this aspect of the game. These are the most recent findings, and while they are only estimates, enough data was involved in the calculations for an overall accurate result.




 Shiny Rates  Encounter Method   1 in 500 or 0.2%  Base rate for finding a Shiny Pokémon.   1 in 256 or 0.39%  Rate for a Shadow Pokémon caught from Team GO Rocket Grunts to be Shiny. Odds for some smaller events in Pokémon GO to produce Shiny Pokémon.   1 in 128 or 0.78%  Shiny rate for rare types of Pokémon. Pokémon captured from Mega Raids. Meltan, during the rare occurrences when a Shiny form is available. Rate for some moderate-sized events in Pokémon GO to produce Shiny Pokemon.   1 in 64 or 1.56%  Odds for Shiny versions of Pokémon that are rarely, if ever, found in the wild. Shadow Pokémon caught from Team GO Rocket leaders. Ticketed Pokémon GO events. Event-boosted Shiny rate for some Eggs.   1 in 25 or 4%  Community Day featured Pokémon. Ticketed, local events such as the Pokémon GO Tour​​​​​​.   1 in 20 or 5%  Certain Limited Time Research events. Legendary Pokémon, Mythical Pokémon, and Ultra Beasts from 5-star Raids   1 in 10 or 10%  Raid Day events. Certain Limited Time Research events. Hatch Day events.   



Community Day events, Timed Research events, and any ticketed event will give higher odds of finding a Shiny Pokémon of whichever creature is being highlighted at that time. Some events with optional tickets available for purchase may offer an increase in odds of finding Shinies, but it is important to always read the explanation of what is included in the ticket. Tickets for things such as the Pokémon GO Fest will state whether they include boosted Shiny rates during the event.




                  One Pokémon GO Update Would Make Catching New Pokémon So Much Better   Pokémon GO gives players a fun incentive to get outside and go for a walk, but catching new Pokémon in the game could be a better experience.   

Although the odds for Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon GO are high, trainers will have to actively seek them out. Pokémon on the overworld always appear in their regular coloration, so the only way to find out if they’re shiny is to enter a battle with them.



Clicking on a Pokémon in the wild will make that creature turn to face the trainer&#39;s avatar. If the trainer then backs out of the catch screen to continue checking others in the area without catching it, each of the Pokémon who have been clicked on will continue to face the trainer, thereby signaling who has already been checked.




This is also the case with Pokémon GO raid Pokémon, which always appear with their regular colors during the raid battle itself and will only appear shiny during the bonus challenge. Unsurprisingly, the same is true of Shadow Pokémon, which appear with normal colors when used by a Team Rocket member.






 Certain Raids In Pokémon GO Are Great Shiny Catching Opportunities

In general, when a trainer wants to increase their Shiny Pokémon collection in Pokémon GO, looking at some of the more difficult raids or participating in a Raid Day event is a great place to start. Raid events can provide a 1 in 10 chance of seeing a Shiny, while a regular, everyday Five-Star Raid can have a 1 in 20 chance. Mega Raids, which are often less difficult than Five-Stars, will also see the odds change to 1 in 128. Additionally, if the raid involves a Pokémon that is rare to spawn in the wild, such as a baby Pokémon, it will see a Shiny rate of 1 in 64. 



 Why Pokémon GO&#39;s Shiny Chances Are Better Than Most 
          




Mainline Pokémon video games have much lower chances of finding a Shiny unless incorporating specific tactics to increase the chances. The original games started with a 1 in 8192 chance, approximately 0.01%, which required the use of things like objects such as Shiny Charm keys or things such as mass outbreaks in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and chain fishing in Gen 6. Despite the various increases and unique methods of obtaining Shiny Pokémon, these elusive creatures have remained rare throughout the history of the Pokémon games.

On the other hand, Pokémon GO revolves around capturing many Pokémon for the sake of powering them up, so a higher Shiny rate can help continue a positive gameplay loop. Even in the circumstances where a trainer already has a particular Pokémon registered in their Pokédex and maxed out their CP, they will still want to check wild ones as they pass by just in case they encounter a Shiny. Shiny odds in Pokémon GO, therefore, benefit from being much higher than even Pokémon Legends: Arceus with all its methods of adding to the Shiny find rate. This pure rate increase balances out the general lack of control offered over finding or hatching Pokémon in the game. 




                  Pokémon GO: Every Pokémon You Can&#39;t Trade (&amp; Why)   Pokémon GO allows players to trade Pokémon, which effectively transfers them to others. Pokémon GO does not allow players to trade back, though.   

New Shiny Pokémon come to Pokémon GO all the time, and any list of available Shinies quickly becomes incorrect or out-of-date. Although this can be disorienting at times, it also helps to keep the Shiny hunt in Pokémon GO fresh and surprising. Often, when Shiny Pokémon are introduced to the game, they will get their own Community Day, Raid hours, or special Research events to celebrate their inclusion into Pokémon GO, so it is always a good idea to keep an eye out for what event is coming up next.
