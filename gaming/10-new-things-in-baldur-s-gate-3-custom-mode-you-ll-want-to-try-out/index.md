## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s new Custom Mode allows players even greater control over many of the game&#39;s settings, but which ones should people try first?




The latest patch for Baldur’s Gate 3 added many new things, including bug fixes and an epilogue party hosted by Withers. Alongside the combat tweaks and inventory overhauls are two new gameplay modes: Honour and Custom. While Honour Mode is designed to give players a significant challenge with a single save file, Custom Mode allows for an experience which will be completely unique to each playthrough.
Patch 5 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3was a big one, adding a long list of changes and additions to the already epic game. One such change is the new Custom Mode, which will allow players to change many of the game&#39;s settings to create a playthough that is perfect for them. There are tons of options in the new setting, tweaking everything from how many camp supplies are needed for a long rest right through to vendor prices and passive rolls. With so many options, it might be a little overwhelming, but some of the changes now available are more interesting than others.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Always Prompt Reactions 
Reactions Won’t Trigger Automatically
        

Reactions are great in both BG3 and DnD, allowing characters to use special abilities in response to an attack or other triggering event. However, one of the more annoying aspects of them in BG3 is that the prompt to use them has to be turned on manually, this prompt will pause the game briefly allowing the decision to use the reaction to be made. If this is not enabled, then characters will automatically use their reactions, which can sometimes mean burning needed spell slots. Always Prompt Reactions does exactly what it says and sets all reactions for all characters to ask before they are used, preventing any headaches later down the line.





 9  Multiclassing 
Decide Whether Or Not To Multiclass On Any Difficulty
        

Multiclassing is a lot of fun, and it is possible to create some really fun-to-play builds in BG3. In Custom Mode there is an option to toggle whether multiclassing is enabled or disabled and this is useful for a couple of reasons. First, it provides the option for those who wish to play on lower difficulty but who want to multiclass as multiclassing is not available in Explorer Mode. The other reason is that it is possible to create some very powerful characters through multiclassing, and those looking for an extra challenge may want to disable this with options that mimic Tactician Mode for a real test of their skill.





 8  Proficiency Bonus 
Full Control Over The Proficiency Bonus
        

The proficiency bonus a character receives in BG3 determines what bonus they get when making skill checks and attack rolls throughout the game. By default, this is set at zero for Balanced and Tactician and will increase as the characters level up, whereas Explorer Mode gives a plus two to the proficiency bonus on top of what is gained by leveling. Custom Mode allows the proficiency bonus to be altered to a maximum of plus four or even minus one to make the game more difficult.





 7  Enemy Aggression 
Determines How Dangerous Enemies Are


 







Enemy Aggression can also be altered in Custom Mode with three options available: Explorer, Balanced, or Tactician. These three options will set enemies&#39; behavior to mimic the three main difficultly modes for BG3. This is most noticeable with Tactician Mode, where enemies will behave more tactically, such as specifically targeting spellcasters or weakened allies. Altering this setting will allow for great control over the challenge the party face in any playthrough.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It) 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.








 6  Character Power 
Determines How Strong Player Characters &amp; Allies Are
        

Character Power is the other side of the coin to Enemy Aggression and dictates how much health the party has, how much health enemies have, and any bonuses to skill and attack rolls. Just as with Enemy Aggression, the options are based on the three primary modes for BG3. In Explorer Mode, the party receives a buff to their hit points, while enemy health is decreased by 30%, while in Tactician enemies gain health, with some bosses gaining between 20-30% more than they would have in Balanced Mode. This option can be used alongside Enemy Aggression to make things easier for the party or create a true challenge.





 5  Enemy Critical Hits 
Allow Or Deny Enemies The Chance To Land Crits
        

It&#39;s a great feeling when a party member scores a critical hit against an enemy in BG3, but the same can&#39;t be said when enemies do the same. The Enemy Critical Hits option will either allow enemies to be able to land critical hits against the party or not. This is a useful option when facing particularly tough bosses or when trying out new builds or party compositions. By default, enemies are able to score critical hits against the party, but turning this off will make some combat encounters in the game much easier.





 4  Short Rest Full Heal 
Regain All Hit Points On A Short Rest


 







Resting in BG3 is very important. Not only does it replenish health and resources like spell slots and class features, but it also moves the story along with cut scenes. The party are able to short rest twice per long rest, and by default will regain an amount of health equal to half their maximum hit points, as well as certain class features. However, with Custom Mode, there is an option to regain full health during a short rest, which later in the game, with increasingly tougher fights, can really come in handy. The option does not alter spell slot or ability regeneration and is a nice option for those playing with squishier classes like spellcasters.





 3  No Death Saving Throws 
Stabilize Any Companions That Drop To Zero Hit Points
       A downed character lays on the floor in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.  

For those looking for a safer playthrough for their companions, there is an option in Custom Mode to turn off death saving throws. No Death Saving Throws does exactly what it says and stops downed companions from making d20 rolls to see if they die or stabilize. This does not mean that companions will simply die if they are reduced to zero hit points; instead, they will be knocked out and stabilize, ready to be healed and for the adventure to continue.
            
 
 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Finally Makes One Beloved Character Canon (But It&#39;s Easy To Miss) 
A tiny NPC from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons one-shot with the Baldur’s Gate 3 cast has now joined the game’s canon in the most unexpected but wonderful way.








 2  Hide NPC Health 
Hides The Health Bars Of NPCs
        

For a more authentic DnD experience in BG3, Custom Mode offers the option now to Hide NPC Health. This would make battles more interesting and more akin to combat in DnD, where the exact hit points of the enemies are unknown to the party. Not knowing precisely how much health a boss has and therefore whether to use a spell or a cantrip makes resource management and tactics more important and combat much more interesting.





 1  Hide Difficulty Class During Rolls 
Keep The DC Of A Check A Mystery


 







Finally, the Hide Difficulty Class During Rolls option also provides a more authentic DnD experience, as it is rare for a player to know the DC of a skill check before the DM has them roll. Hiding this will mean that knowing when to apply buffs such as guidance becomes more relevant when attempting to persuade or lockpick. This is a neat option that adds a level of challenge to a playthrough of Baldur’s Gate 3 without impacting the difficulty of the game too much.
