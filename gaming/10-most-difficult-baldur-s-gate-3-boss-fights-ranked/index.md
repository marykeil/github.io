## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is packed with tough enemies to challenge the party, but some boss fights require more preparation and tactics to take them down.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 isn&#39;t a game that&#39;s afraid to challenge its players, and nowhere is that more obvious than the game&#39;s boss fights. Each one must be approached like a puzzle to be solved with different strategies needed each time. While all the bosses in BG3 are designed to be difficult, some are notoriously tougher than others.
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
From the early stages right through to the very end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, there are opponents for the party to face that might have them scratching their head or tearing their hair out in frustration. Obviously, with so many classes to choose from when creating a custom character and putting together a party, some will find these fights more difficult than others, as class abilities and synergies play a large part in BG3. While some of these boss fights can be avoided through dialogue, all will require a little more strategy should the party come to blows with them.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Grym 
Act 1, Grymforge


 







Down in the depths of Grymforge is the forge&#39;s guardian, Grym, a huge construct capable of packing quite the punch and who is immune to all damage types. If that wasn&#39;t enough, the party will need to be surrounded by lava for as much of the fight as possible to superheat Grym and make the party able to damage it. Grym&#39;s fight requires a fair bit of strategy and clever use of the environment, as it will need to be lured to the center of the area so that the forge&#39;s hammer can be used to hit Grym.
There is a Steam achievement called A Grym Fate for beating Grym in BG3 without using the forge hammer, which requires a little more effort and thought, with the party needing to deal out massive amounts of bludgeoning damage. 






 9  Auntie Ethel 
Act 1, Riverside Teahouse
        

Auntie Ethel provides not one, but two tough boss fights in the game, but by far the hardest of those comes in Act 1 when the party is still low level. Navigating through her lair, bypassing traps and guards, the party will find Ethel deep underground. Ethel is a tough fight to go into unprepared as she will split into several illusory doubles, make herself look like the innocent girl, Mayrina, and make use of the spell hold person. All of this can add up to a pretty miserable time at low levels but it feels even better when she finally falls.





 8  Gerringothe Thorm 
Act 2, The Toll House
        

In Act 2, the party will come across several members of the Thorm family and each will provide their own unique challenge. One of these comes in the form of Gerringothe Thorm, a portly woman made entirely of gold, who will demand that the party give her more gold to be allowed to pass. It is possible to avoid a fight with Gerringothe in BG3 completely by choosing the right dialogue options, and this is highly recommended as not only will it give the achievement Penny Pincher, but her fight is ridiculously hard.
Gerringothe deals more damage to characters the more gold they have on them and is backed up by several Visages to hinder the party. Despite her appearance, Gerringothe moves very quickly and has very high health, which makes wearing her down a slog. Taking out the Grim Visages will reduce her hit points by 100 each time, and collecting the scattered gold around the area to stop her from making use of some of her special abilities is the best tactic should a fight be unavoidable.





 7  Malus Thorm 
Act 2, The House Of Healing


 







Another member of the Thorm family who will prove a tough fight for the unprepared is Malus Thorm, the surgeon found in the House of Healing. Backed up by the undead Sisters, Malus can quickly deal out a ton of damage while the Sisters overwhelm the party, so ranged attacks work best here while keeping the party moving. However, just like Gerringothe, the fight with Malus can be avoided altogether by choosing the right dialogue options and having him and the Sisters kill themselves.





 6  Yurgir 
Act 2, Gauntlet Of Shar
        

Yet another boss fight that can be avoided with the right dialogue, Yurgir is an orthon the party is sent to kill as a favor to Raphael. If a fight ensues, then the party will immediately be at a disadvantage, as Yurgir and his merregons and displacer beast will have them surrounded from a high vantage point. With numbers on their side and the high ground, this fight can quickly go wrong unless the party are able to get on the same level as Yurgir and his minions.
If Yurgir is killed in Act 2, he will return in the House of Hope during the fight with Raphael. Here it is possible to persuade him to aid the party, although the DC is very high. 






 5  Ketheric Thorm 
Act 2, Moonrise Towers


 







As one of the Chosen of the Dead Three, Ketheric Thorm is the first of BG3&#39;s primary villains the party will face. The fight is broken up into three parts, the first two with Ketheric himself, then after his defeat as the Apostle of Myrkul. Ketheric is backed up by undead and mind flayers, and that&#39;s before even getting to the Apostle of Myrkul section of the fight. The whole thing is a massive slog, made even worse if the Nightsong was killed, so long resting after the first fight is recommended.
The second fight with Ketheric can be avoided with the right dialogue choices; however, the battles on top of Moonrise Towers and the Apostle of Myrkul are unavoidable. 






 4  Sarevok 
Act 3, Baldur’s Gate Sewers
        

The antagonist of Baldur&#39;s Gate returns in BG3&#39;s Act 3 as the party face off against Sarevok Anchev on their quest to find Orin. Sarevok alone would be a tough fight, but he is backed up by three echos: Illasera, Sendai, and Amelyssan, all of whom appeared in previous Baldur&#39;s Gate games. As each of the echos is killed by the party, they empower Sarevok, who is permanently under the effects of haste, has a whopping 262 hit points and an AC of 20. The fight itself is all about managing the party&#39;s buffs and health to counteract everything Sarevok and the Murder Tribunal can throw at them.





 3  Cazador 
Act 3, Cazador’s Palace
        

At the end of Astarion&#39;s personal quest, the party will face the master vampire, Cazador. Cazador&#39;s fight is a timed one, and he must be beaten in four to five turns, or he will complete his dark ritual and Astarion will die. This adds a sense of panic to an already tough battle, as waves of undead will aid Cazador as he zips around the battlefield. The trick to this fight is using radiant damage and the daylight spell, which will give the party some advantage. Overall, to beat Cazador, the party will have to understand what is powering him and what vulnerabilities he has.
Players would often use the trick of shoving Cazador off the high platform the fight takes place on to defeat him, but this has since been patched, and he will appear in mist form to continue the fight. 






 2  Ansur 
Act 3, The Wyrmway
        

Ansur is a boss many might miss on their first playthrough of BG3, as the undead dragon is tucked away underneath the city. There are no quests directly associated with locating him or the Wyrmway, so exploration is really the only way to stumble across him. That said, some parties may regret doing that, as Ansur is a very formidable enemy. The fight with Ansur is a long one, made longer by his ability Gather Power, which lets him become resistant to all forms of damage and then unleash Stormheart Nova, a powerful AOE attack that can easily wipe the party.





 1  Raphael 
Act 3, The House Of Hope


 







Finally, the toughest boss fight in BG3 is undoubtedly when the party face Raphael. After breaking into his House of Hope, the party will eventually face off against the scheming devil in a fun but difficult battle. Raphael has lots of minions on his side, along with his own tricks and an impressive 666 hit points and AC of 27, but by focusing on the Soul Pillars and using radiant damage, the party will be able to take down Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s most daunting boss.
