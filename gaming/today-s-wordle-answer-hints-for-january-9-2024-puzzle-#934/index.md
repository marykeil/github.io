Every day brings a new Wordle word to solve. Here are the daily hints and fully spoiled answer to the January 9th Wordle.





Our particular game today took us all the way to our sixth Wordle guess and we barely squeaked out a win. Sometimes it takes more than a good Wordle strategy to win the daily game, it takes a little luck.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer 
January 9th #934
          




The January 8th Wordle answer is LINER.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which provided quite a few misplaced letters to start out with. Mixing those up we tried FIRES as our second attempt, this locked in the two vowels and gave us another incorrect placement for the &#39;R&#39;.

Moving forward we tried RILED which basically locked in the &#39;R&#39; as it was incorrect here but there is only one other possible spot for it, and it added a newly misplaced &#39;L&#39;. This is where things began to get scary. Our fourth attempt was LIVER locking in all the letters except the center one, and there are quite a few letters that could fill that spot. Attempt number five was another fail with LIGER.

As our last guess loomed we went through the list of what it could be but got really lucky by scoring our Wordle win-in-six with the correct answer, LINER.
