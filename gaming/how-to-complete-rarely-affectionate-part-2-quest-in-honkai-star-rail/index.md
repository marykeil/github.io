The Rarely Affectionate (Part 2) side quest in Honkai: Star Rail sees players try to complete some repairs for Pascal, the companion robot of Clara.





After the Sinners Misled and Credence Falsified main story quests, the Rarely Affectionate series of missions will open up for you to pursue. You must be Trailblaze Level 34 to receive the first messages from the character Clara in Honkai: Star Rail that marks the Robot Settlement as the starting point for this quest. Clara will ask for help regarding Pascal in the Belobog area, which you can discover by using your map of the Settlement.






There have been reported issues of the second part of the Rarely Affectionate quest not showing up for some players. If you encounter this problem, returning to the Parlor Car has been discovered as a way to fix this bug.

Returning to Clara initiates the quest in Honkai: Star Rail, where players travel east to collect parts for Pascal to solve the issues that arose in Part 1 of the mission. Taking the elevator before traveling puts players in the correct position, where they can travel to find a Direwolf Automatonenemy. Unfortunately, the machine turns aggressive and must be defeated in battle before players return to Savrogwith robot parts, which they install onto Pascal.

Unfortunately, fixing Pascal like this causes them to flee to Rivet Town, where an Automaton Grizzly enemy attacks them. You have to defeat the Grizzly to save Pascal, but doing this causes the robot to run away again, this time toward a hidden location called The Tempering Workshop in Honkai: Star Rail. Even though Clara installed part of the Grizzly into Pascal, there are still some repairs that need to be done.






You can track down the location of The Tempering Workshop by traveling to Rivet Town in Jarilo-VI. This place does not have a marker on the map but exists west of the Town&#39;s central area.




Finding Pascal reveals the connection between the robot and Clara and why she is trying so hard to fix the machine. From here, you are given two choices regarding Pascal&#39;s fate, both provided through suggestions given by Clara and Savrog. Savrog suggests erasing Pascal&#39;s emotional intelligence and removing all its corrupted data, while Clara begs you to &#34;lock&#34; Pascal&#39;s core to prevent it from harming anyone.



 Rewards For Completing The Rarely Affectionate (Part 2) Quest 
          

No matter what you choose to do with Pascal, Clara will join the Astral Express crew as your primary reward. However, there are two different achievements tied to both outcomes that also give a unique dialogue with Clara and Savrog. Picking the cold logic of Savrog gives you the &#34;For A Breath I Tarry&#34; achievement, while siding with Clara&#39;s pleas will earn you the &#34;The Lifecycle of Software Objects&#34; achievement in Honkai: Star Rail.




Clara is a powerful Destruction character in Honkai: Star Rail who will undoubtedly be a great team member against the tougher enemies you&#39;ll face as you continue taking on quests tied to the main story.
