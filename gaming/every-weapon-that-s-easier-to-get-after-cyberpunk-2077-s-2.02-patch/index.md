## Literature Review

Some unique weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 can be permanently missed during a playthrough - but patch 2.02 makes some of them easier to get.




As Cyberpunk 2077 continues to receive patches after the release of its Phantom Liberty DLC and major 2.0 update, some bugs regarding quests and world interactions have been fixed, and a few rare weapons have been made easier or more forgiving to acquire in-game. As many of Cyberpunk&#39;s rare and unique Iconic weapons can be permanently missed in over the course of a playthrough, making them easier to find is a big benefit for those who want to use or test out a wide variety of playstyles.
With the release of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s DLC, an option was also provided to skip ahead to Phantom Liberty, bypassing the majority of the main game&#39;s first and second acts to start directly at the point where the DLC content becomes available. To make up for the Iconic weapons that would be missed doing this, and to generally give a second chance to pick up Iconic weapons that might&#39;ve been otherwise permanently missed in the base game, Phantom Liberty also provides a new black market store, where some Iconic weapons can be purchased if a player didn&#39;t pick them up or missed them in missions - notably, however, this does not include weapons that become inaccessible as the result of player choices.
            
 
 Every New Weapon In Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC 
The new Phantom Liberty expansion to Cyberpunk 2077 is bringing an immense amount of new content, including exciting new weapons to play with.













 








 4  Sasquatch&#39;s Hammer 
Iconic Weapon Of The Animals&#39; Leader
        

Sasquatch&#39;s Hammer, the only Iconic blunt hammer in the game, is normally obtained from the quest &#34;I Walk the Line&#34; where, after sneaking or fighting through the Grand Imperial Mall (GIM) on the behalf of Placide and the Voodoo Boys, the boss of the Animals, Sasquatch, is standing in the way. Depending on whether the mission was done stealthily, V can either sneak past her or fight her, but either way, her weapon, Sasquatch&#39;s Hammer, is lying out in the open and can be stolen, or taken after defeating her in a boss fight.
            
 
 Cyberpunk 2077: How to Beat Sasquatch (Tips, Tricks, &amp; Strategies) 
Cyberpunk 2077 has a boss named Sasquatch, and she is a big melee brute who can be taken down with some agility and well-placed headshots.




As the Sasquatch fight can be hectic, and since she usually throws the hammer somewhere in the room if she&#39;s allowed to pick it up, many players might fail to pick it up before proceeding through the rest of the quest and leaving the GIM, which, prior to patch 2.02, would render the weapon inaccessible for the rest of a playthrough without reloading a save or using mods. As of the patch, however, Sasquatch&#39;s Hammer can be purchased from the black market in Dogtown if it was missed during the quest, allowing players to get their hands on the slow, but incredibly hard-hitting weapon.





 3  Plan B 
Dexter DeShawn&#39;s Iconic Pistol
        

Dexter DeShawn&#39;s Iconic pistol, Plan B, is normally accessed by looting it from his body, which in a standard playthrough could be found by revisiting the same dump where he was killed by Takemura in the game&#39;s intro. However, with the added option to skip to Phantom Liberty, players who chose to go directly to the DLC would be locked out of getting the weapon in that playthrough, as Dex&#39;s body wouldn&#39;t spawn in the dump. As of patch 2.02, however, Dex&#39;s body and Plan B will now correctly spawn in the dump even on playthroughs that skip to the DLC.





 2  La Chingona Dorada 
Jackie Welles&#39; Iconic Pistols
        

Similarly, Jackie&#39;s twin Iconic pistols, La Chingona Dorada, were rendered inaccessible in playthroughs that chose to skip to Phantom Liberty. Normally, if players chose to send Jackie&#39;s body to his family during &#34;The Heist,&#34; the pistols would be lying on his altar in El Coyote Cojo, and could be freely picked up and added to a player&#39;s arsenal. For those who bypassed the opening parts of the main game, however, the pistols would not be accessible. With patch 2.02, La Chingona Dorada can be picked up regardless of playthrough type.





 1  Bald Eagle 
Kurt Hansen&#39;s Iconic Revolver


 







Finally, Kurt Hansen&#39;s Iconic revolver, Bald Eagle, can be picked up off his body in a late main quest for Phantom Liberty, &#34;Firestarter.&#34; When V is given the choice to side with Reed or Songbird, Hansen is either killed in a cutscene by Alex, if Songbird&#39;s side was chosen, or becomes a boss fight for the player to take on if they sided with Reed. Notably, Hansen has three Iconic weapons - the Wild Dog LMG, the Fang knife, and the Bald Eagle. However, while players who chose to side with Songbird could acquire the first two, the Bald Eagle would be inaccessible.
            
 
 10 Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty Choices That Matter Most 
Not every choice in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty matters, but many of them do have major consequences. Hereâ€™s what to watch out for.




While Hansen&#39;s body is still harder to find and get to when siding with Songbird over Reed, as of patch 2.02, all three of Hansen&#39;s Iconic weapons can be looted from his body regardless of the decision, giving full access to Hansen&#39;s unique arsenal. This is especially important as the Bald Eagle has specific synergy with the Fang knife - throwing the knife into an enemy&#39;s leg and then shooting that leg with the Bald Eagle would instantly dismember them, and return the Fang to the player&#39;s hand, allowing it to be used again immediately.
Iconic weapons sometimes have a dual purpose in Cyberpunk 2077; aside from being uniquely powerful, they may also fit into V&#39;s displayable stash in their apartment. Certain weapons in the game being missable made it much harder to 100% the game, as a slight lapse in diligence could potentially make just a single item inaccessible. Patch 2.02 has helped tremendously in this regard, and the black market which the Iconic weapons are bought through simultaneously serves to build up the world building of Dogtown, the notoriously seedy setting of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.
