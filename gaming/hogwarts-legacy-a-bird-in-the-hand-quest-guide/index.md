## Literature Review

In A Bird In The Hand, Hogwarts Legacy players must help Poppy Sweeting solve puzzles to find and protect a nest of Golden Snidgets from poachers.





To start A Bird In The Hand, you need to have used all unlocked spells in Hogwarts Legacy to help Poppy free a Dragon during the Fire and Vice main story quest. This opens Poppy’s relationship questline, where you can help Poppy confront the poachers and build a steady friendship with her. During A Bird In The Hand, you will receive a message from Poppy, asking them to meet her and Dorran south of Brocburrow to investigate a mysterious sanctuary where they suspect some Golden Snidgets are hidden.




                  Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s Relationship Quests All Share The Same Problem   Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s companions could have been even better than they presently are, had this fundamental issue not stunted their in-game significance.   


 How To Help Poppy Sweeting And Complete A Bird In The Hand 
        Make sure the pedestal with the moonstone blocks the light from the pillars, so a shadow is cast.   

Head to the location marked on the map to meet up with Dorran and Poppy. After a short cutscene, you will need to enter a ruin that requires you to solve a puzzle. Similar to Hogwarts Legacy’s Bell Tower puzzle, it isn&#39;t too hard to crack. To solve it, place the moonstone on the pedestal, making the two symbols glow. These symbols also appear on the ground near the two pillars with lights. 



 How To Solve The Pillar Puzzle 
          




Use the Accio spell to move the pillars around so that their shadows project on the two symbols. Make sure the shadows projects on the symbols that match the glowing symbols on the ruin&#39;s door. This will open the door to the ruins and lead to another puzzle.

          

         

Once you reach a dead end inside the ruins, you will come across an Elemental Cube Puzzle, similar to the ones found in Hogwarts Legacy’s Treasure Vaults. The first cube is behind the tree to the left. 



You can use Wingardium Leviosa to move it onto the platform with the fire symbol, then use Incendio or Confringo to light it.







         

The second cube is up on the landing to the right. To get it, you should use Wingardium Leviosa to move the block on the left to the right, then use it to climb up onto the second level to grab the cube. This cube should be placed on the other platform, and you should cast Glacius to open the door.

          

Once you enter, you will be ambushed by poachers who you need to fight off. Make sure to use the best spell combos and Ancient Magic to get rid of them quickly. Once you have defeated every enemy in the area, you can unlock the door to the Snidget Sanctuary. Use Glacius to open the door which will trigger a cutscene. After the following cutscene, you will have helped Poppy ensure the Golden Snidgets are safe, completing Hogwarts Legacy’s A Bird In The Hand side quest.
