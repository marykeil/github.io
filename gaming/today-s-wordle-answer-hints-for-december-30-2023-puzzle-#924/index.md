## Literature Review

December 30th’s Wordle answer contains a repeating letter, which could cause players to lose their daily streak if they get reckless.





Using Wordle’s hard mode might be quite handy as it is perfect for finding repeating letters in Wordle answers. Since the game does not have hints for repeating letters, you might end up using random words to find their correct positions. Therefore, this mode is most suitable as it won’t let you reuse confirmed letters in other spots, making it easier to discover the correct positions of the repeating letter.
