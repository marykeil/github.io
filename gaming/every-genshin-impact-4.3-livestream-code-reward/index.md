## Literature Review

The Genshin Impact 4.3 livestream codes are now available for redemption. Claim the prizes, including free Primogems, before the codes expire.




The Genshin Impact 4.3 livestream codes are now live for redemption following the special program related to the upcoming patch. Every six weeks, HoYoverse’s popular action RPG receives updates that add new content to play through and, before every patch, the developer holds a special livestream to showcase the announcements and future additions. This regularly includes new playable characters, as well as story missions and limited-time events.




During these special livestreams, the developer also shares special promo codes, which can be redeemed for several in-game prizes, including extra Primogems in Genshin Impact. Though they are very limited and need to be redeemed before they expire, they are a consistent source of Primogems. This is a way of thanking players for their continued support of the game, as well as compensation for their time invested in watching the livestream.

                  Genshin Impact Natlan Release Date Predictions (Based On Past Updates)   Although HoYoverse has not revealed the release date for Natlan in Genshin Impact, it is possible to predict exactly when it will arrive.   


 Genshin Impact 4.3 Codes &amp; Rewards 
          

The promo codes were shared by the developer during the Version 4.3 livestream held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch. In total, three different livestream codes were given out during the event – this is in line with the regular number of codes distributed with every livestream. The codes give out free Primogems, in addition to Hero’s Wit, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Mora. The codes expire very quickly and should be redeemed before that happens. The table below lists all the code 4.3 livestream codes and their respective rewards:




 Genshin Impact 4.3 Code  Rewards   RS99D5LVTM6V    100x Primogems, 10x Mystic Enhancement Ore      UBRQC4MCT4PZ    100x Primogems, 5x Hero&#39;s Wit      8BQ9CMMVS5PM    100x Primogems, 50,000x Mora      





The 4.3 livestream codes are valid until December 8, at 11 p.m. PST.






 How To Redeem Genshin Impact 4.3 Codes &amp; Claim Rewards 
          

To redeem codes in Genshin Impact, players have two options. The first of them is through the game itself. By logging in and opening the Settings tab in the main menu, players can navigate to the Account page and, there, fill out the Redemption Code slate, and press the redeem button. If successful, the rewards for that respective prize will be sent to their in-game mailbox. The process needs to be repeated with all three 4.3 livestream codes.




Another option is to log in to the official Genshin Impact website and, after filling out the Server and Character Name, use the Redemption Code feature to redeem the livestream codes. Like the previous method, the rewards for each code will be sent to the player&#39;s in-game mailbox, where they need to be claimed. The codes do not provide an abundant source of in-game materials or even Primogems for that matter. Nevertheless, every ounce of help in Genshin Impact is meaningful, especially when trying to beat the odds against the banner system.
