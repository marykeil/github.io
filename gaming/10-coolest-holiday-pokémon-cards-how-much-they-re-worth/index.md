## Literature Review

Surprisingly, there haven’t been many holiday-themed Pokémon cards, but here are several of the best ones that have appeared over the years.




There are many beautiful illustrations and special promo cards for the Pokémon Trading Card Game, but surprisingly, very few of them feature any specific holiday theme. Even cards included in the annual Pokémon TCG advent calendars traditionally feature reprints of other cards with a special holiday snowflake on them. This is disappointing as the artwork for Pokémon cards, specifically for Secret Rares, can be beautifully crafted and lend itself well to having more thematic attributes.
Thankfully, there are a few Pokémon TCG cards that have a bit of festive merriment in them. Whether it is a snow or ice-themed Pokémon that fits with the snowy winter feeling of the holidays, such as Beartic, or a surprising choice for a holiday spotlight, such as Flaaffy, some beautiful cards evoke more of a festive feeling. Even Pokémon&#39;s mascot, Pikachu, has a promo card in the holiday sets, although it is disappointingly not very decorated. Here are ten of the best Pokémon TCG cards to assist in decking the halls this holiday.
            
 
 Everything In Pokémon TCG&#39;s Holiday Calendar 2023 
The 2023 Advent Calendar for the Pokémon Trading Card Game is out now, with V cards and more being offered up this holiday season.












 








 10  Beartic (049/189) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Darkness Ablaze
        

Beartic has appeared in several of the Pokémon holiday advent calendar promotional products over the past couple of years. This snowy bear is an evolution of Cubchoo and its holiday card shows the unique snowflake festive stamp on it. The card itself is a reprint from card 049/189 of the Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield - Darkness Ablaze set and at the time of writing it has a market price value on TCGPlayer of $0.92 USD.
Like other Pokémon trading cards, prices on TCGPlayer will fluctuate over time. 






 9  Eiscue V (055/192) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Rebel Clash


 







While Eiscue somehow manages to be simultaneously creepy while also adorable, its ice and snow effect lends itself well to the seasonal feeling. Eiscue V is another that appears in the Pokémon TCG holiday calendars with the festive snowflake stamp emblazoned on it but is a reprint of an older card. Originally, Eiscue V was card 055/192 from the Sword &amp; Shield: Rebel Clash set. Its holiday promotion reprint is currently showing a market value on TCGPlayer of $1.10 USD.





 8  Glastrier (051/196) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Lost Origin
        

The beautiful winter scene of snow-covered evergreen trees in the distance with the pink glow of sunrise gives this wild horse Pokémon card a sense of a peaceful holiday morning. This Glastrier card was card 051/196 from Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield - Lost Origin before being reprinted with the snowflake stamp for the Holiday Calendar promos. Right now, TCGPlayer is listing the holiday Glastrier card at a market price of $1.26 USD.





 7  Pikachu (SWSH153) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Black Star and Holiday Calendar Promo


 







For collectors who may have missed out on Pikachu&#39;s Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield&#39;s Black Star Promo card, it has been reprinted with the snowflake stamp for several of the Holiday Calendars. This card doesn&#39;t really have anything special to make it feel festive for the season besides that snowflake and shows more of a summery scene with the Electric-type Pikachu holding a flower. Being a rarer promo card, however, makes it a desirable pull, with a current market price on TCGPlayer of $15.96 USD.





 6  Abomasnow (010/198) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Chilling Reign
        

The living Frost Tree Pokémon, Abomasnow, is indicative of winter storms with one shake of its body being enough to start a blizzard. It has appeared in several of the Holiday Calendars over the past couple of years and is a reprint from Sword &amp; Shield: Chilling Reign card number 010/198. At the time of writing, TCGPlayer has the festive snowflake stamped edition of this card listed at a market price of $0.91 USD.





 5  Glaceon VMAX (041/203) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Evolving Skies
        

The glacial evolution of fan-favorite Eevee is a beautiful card for the Pokémon TCG Holiday Calendar promos. This card for Glaceon VMAX is not only stamped with the holiday snowflake but its swirls of colorful lights that are illustrated on this full-art card could easily be interpreted as Christmas lights in motion. Glaceon VMAX card 041/203 is a reprint of the Sword &amp; Shield: Evolving Skies set, and this holiday promo version is showing on TCGPlayer with a current market value of $3.10 USD.
            
 
 10 Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift Secret Rares Worth The Most Money 
Pokémon Trading Card Game’s newest set Paradox Rift has over 80 beautiful Secret Rare cards included in it, which are already proving valuable.








 4  Ice Rider Calyrex VMAX (046/198) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Chilling Reign
        

Similar to the Glaceon shown above, Ice Rider Calyrex is another VMAX card with beautiful swirls of light around the icy full-art card. It was originally card number 046/198 in the Sword &amp; Shield: Chilling Reign set that was reprinted for the Pokémon TCG Holiday Calendar with the festive stamp marking it. On TCGPlayer, the holiday edition promo is listed with a market value of $1.34 USD.

Pokémon GO’s Winter Holiday Event Part 1 runs December 15 to 23, 2022, with holiday Pikachu, new avatar items, exclusive Timed Research, and more.








 3  Jumpluff (9/64) 
Originally From Neo Revelation Set
        

Back in 2001, the Pokémon TCG: Neo Revelation set was released and included this Jumpluff card as number 9/64. It is not a promo card for any holiday set, but the artwork for the card has a very festive feel to it. Two cheerful Jumpluff are enjoying the falling snow next to a traditional snowman with a red scarf and green mittens. Currently, this Holo Rare card is showing a market value on TCGPlayer of $46.00 USD.





 2  Flaaffy (077/165) 
Originally From Expedition Set
        

This Flaaffy card from the Pokémon TCG: Expedition set is unique in several ways. The Expedition Base Set was the first e-reader set and removed flavor text and changed the basic layout of the card. The cards had a special e-reader code that could be scanned by a GameBoy Advance peripheral scanner. Besides these noticeable differences, this Flaaffy card is also one of the only Pokémon TCG cards to ever include a Christmas tree in its artwork, with one prominently showing behind Flaaffy in its illustration. On TCGPlayer this unique foil card has a market value of $9.03 USD.

 1  Delibird (032/198) Holiday Calendar Promo 
Originally From Sword &amp; Shield: Chilling Reign


 







No other character in the Pokémon universe is quite as festive as Delibird. This generous gift-giving bird has a very Santa-like appearance to it and always carrying its sack to quickly deliver presents or food to other Pokémon or humans. As such, this card has been included in the Pokémon Trading Card Game Holiday Calendar over the years with the festive snowflake stamp included on it. At the time of writing, it is listed with a market value on TCGPlayer of $0.99 USD.
