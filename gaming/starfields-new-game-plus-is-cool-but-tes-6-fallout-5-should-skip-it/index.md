# Starfields New Game Plus Is Cool, But TES 6 &amp; Fallout 5 Should Skip It


## SUMMARY 



  Starfield&#39;s new game plus mechanic is intriguing and fits well with its world, but it lacks depth and falls short of creating a compelling gameplay experience.   While the addition of new game plus in Starfield showcases Bethesda&#39;s desire to evolve, it may not be necessary for future games like The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5, given the established lore of these franchises.   A new game plus feature in Bethesda games, although interesting, goes against the unique qualities and enjoyment of exploration and role-playing across multiple playthroughs that players traditionally experience in these games.

## Literature Review

Starfield features a cool NG&#43; mode, a first for Bethesda&#39;s titles. However, there&#39;s a good reason why it should stay out of future games like TES 6.




The new game plus mechanic in Starfield is intriguing, but future Bethesda games like The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 would be better off without it. Bethesda’s latest title has been the subject of much debate since its launch, and critique has only grown as the players have spent more time with it. NG&#43; is one of the most prominent points of contention for several reasons. It is a bit concerning for the studio&#39;s future titles, especially if Bethesda decides to double down on the mechanic. Of course, future iterations would likely be better than what it is in Starfield, but it can be argued that Bethesda games don’t even need new game plus to begin with.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Starfield.]

Starfield introduced a few exciting features new to Bethesda games, like expansive custom shipbuilding, but new game plus is perhaps the most game-changing. However, it is really only game-changing for Bethesda’s titles, since NG&#43; has been a prevalent feature in modern roleplaying games for quite some time. Starfield has highlighted how dated the studio’s formula has become, but the addition of new game plus could point to Bethesda’s desire to evolve. However, it may not be entirely necessary to craft a great experience. To be clear, Bethesda did something really intriguing with Starfield’s new game plus, but it comes up short in some glaring ways.

 Starfield’s NG&#43; Fits Perfectly In Its World But Lacks Depth 
         




Starfield’s new game plus makes perfect sense in its world, but it’s ultimately pretty shallow. Bethesda’s inclination to tie the game mechanic to a narrative concept in the game world is brilliant. When players finally reach the game’s end and discover the Unity, they are offered a choice to stay in the current universe or see what awaits in another. Upon entering a new universe, the player character becomes Starborn, taking all their knowledge from the previous universe into the next. This opens up new dialogue choices and ways to progress through the quests.

It’s a unique take on the multiverse trend that so many games, films, and television series are jumping into lately, but it does so in an intriguing way that helps define Starfield’s lore. There is exciting potential in the idea that the player character knows exactly what the player knows and can use that knowledge to affect the world around them. It’s a clever display of meta commentary on replaying a game when already knowing everything about its characters and story. In a way, it brings the player much closer to being the actual player character.




However, Starfield doesn’t go far enough with this concept to make it a compelling part of the gameplay. There are only minor differences in Starfield’s multiple universes, which only occur at the beginning of a NG&#43; playthrough. There is a huge missed opportunity to have drastically different plot threads, characters, and more, only found in new game plus. It’s somewhat understandable why this isn’t the case, as making something like this fully fleshed out would likely have made for significantly longer development time. There’s a possibility Bethesda could enhance the feature in its next games, but it’s tricky to see how such a concept could work in the studio’s other franchises.

 Imagining New Game Plus In The Elder Scrolls Or Fallout Is Tough 
         




Starfield’s NG&#43; works well in its game world, but that concept is challenging to apply to The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. These franchises have long-established lore that makes the addition of a multiverse infeasible. Admittedly, a multiverse isn’t necessary for new game plus, but Bethesda has always been a narrative-driven studio, so there would have to be some compelling story reason for this mechanic to find its way into future games. Given the recent claims that Bethesda’s formula is outdated, it stands to reason the team would keep this modern gameplay feature moving forward and devote time to crafting ways it could work from a narrative level.

There are ways a new game plus could make narrative sense in each franchise, but the options are somewhat limited. For The Elder Scrolls, magical phenomena could be the catalyst for sending the player back in time to the beginning of the game with all their knowledge. It’s trickier to imagine an explanation for Fallout, but its world has plenty of quirky elements, like aliens, that could provide a narrative means for NG&#43; to exist. These ideas are superficial at best but make the most sense, given the existing lore in each franchise.






Bethesda has confirmed that The Elder Scrolls 6 is the next game it will release.




Of course, it’s possible to have NG&#43; in these games work how it does in most other RPGs, where players carry their skills, inventory, etc., with the game making no narrative connection, but that wouldn’t be Bethesda’s style. The more important point is that new game plus, even in Starfield, kind of flies in the face of how players have historically enjoyed playing Bethesda games, which calls into question its necessity.



 New Game Plus Isn’t Necessary In Bethesda Games 
          

Bethesda games have historically lacked a new game plus feature, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It contributed to a unique quality that most other titles don’t have. Exploration and role-playing have long been Bethesda games&#39; most beloved and well-designed aspects. Wandering through intriguing worlds is a highlight, but playing as a character with particular strengths and restrictions is what makes playthroughs memorable. Tackling the game with a speech-focused build is inherently different than playing as a combat-focused character. The experience is so rewarding and engaging that players are eager to try it all over again from scratch, often with entirely different character builds, to see the game from new perspectives.




Starfield’s NG&#43; is a critical part of the experience, but it puts a damper on playing the game with a completely different build because players could learn all the skills with one character after going through Unity a few times. It creates an odd issue where players debate whether they should rush to Starfield’s new game plus, reaching the final iteration before settling down and enjoying the game as they would previous titles.

It’s questionable to believe that new game plus would have made Fallout 3 or Skyrim better games. Actually, it’s easier to see how the mechanic would’ve weakened these titles. Bethesda included NG&#43; in Starfield to amplify a narrative concept the studio wanted to explore, which is great. However, it led to an experience that felt less impactful and engaging than the studio’s previous games, one that many fans thought they must grind through to enjoy the game as they wanted.

While Starfield’s new game plus feature offers a refreshing take on a commonplace RPG mechanic, its lack of depth prevents it from creating a lasting impact. This feature would undoubtedly improve in future titles, as Bethesda has an impressive knack for refining elements from its past games. However, NG&#43; clearly doesn’t guarantee that the studio’s games will feel modern or better for having it. Should Starfield ever get a sequel, it could be the perfect time to introduce the next take on new game plus. Even a DLC could add more depth to what currently exists in the game, but The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 would probably do well to steer clear of this feature.
