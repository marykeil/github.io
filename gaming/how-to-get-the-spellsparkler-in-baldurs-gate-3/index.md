The Spellsparkler comes with the Electric Blood ability. With the Spellsparkler equipped, you get two Lightning Charges after using a spell or cantrip. The Spellsparkler also has the Topple action, which can knock targets Prone for easier assault and resets after a short rest. The Spellsparkler is a reward for rescuing Counsellor Florrick from a massive fire.




  


 How To Rescue The Counsellor In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

To get the Spellsparkler, you will need to go to Waukeen&#39;s Rest in The Risen Road. This area is encountered early on during Act 1 as there are quite a few quests around, such as &#34;Hunt the Devil,&#34; where you will meet and befriend Karlach in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. By listening to Karlach, you can invite her to your party. Counsellor Florrick is involved in a quest called &#34;Rescue the Grand Duke,&#34; which starts when players arrive at Waukeen&#39;s Rest in the northeastern part of The Risen Road.

When you arrive at Waukeen&#39;s Rest, a group of Flaming Fists will be trying to break down the door to rescue people from the burning building. Your first option for getting inside is to help them break down the door with a Strength Check. You can also have Wyll break down the door. Should you fail, you can perform a basic attack against the door. The roof is another entry point if you climb the rocks to the left and jump down.




Once you are in the burning building, you can find Counsellor Florric on the second floor. You must break down the door the Flamin Fists are facing. Counsellor Florrick will promise to talk to you more outside, where you can get the Spellsparkler.



Breaking down any other doors will hurt your party and the trapped man still inside Waukeen&#39;s Rest.






 Counsellor Florrick&#39;s Rewards 
          

When you speak with Counsellor Florrick outside the fire, she will offer one of three rare weapons as a reward. These weapons are the Spellsparkler, the Joltshooter, and the Sparky Points. All three have the Electric Blood ability, but a few different actions and traits.

The Joltshooter is a longbow with two-handed and range traits that deals 1d8 Piercing damage. Its action is Braced (Ranged), which spends 6 meters of movement for advantage on ranged attacks that turn. Proficiency unlocks Hamstring Shot, which targets an enemy and halves their Movement Speed.




The other option is the Sparky Points, a Trident with Versatile and Thrown traits that can deal 1d6 Piercing damage one-handed and 1d8 Piercing damage two-handed. Upon gaining Proficiency, the Sparky Points gets three actions; Rush Attack, which targets the first enemy in front of you to deal damage and potentially throw them Off Balance; Piercing Strike, which stabs an enemy to potentially apply Gaping Wounds; and Crippling Strike, which can potentially Maim the enemy if they aren&#39;t flying while rendering them immobile.

The Joltshooter and the Sparky Points are good for builds with a focus on weapon damage, as their Electric Blood abilities trigger upon dealing damage with them. The Spellsparkler, however, triggers with cantrips and spells, making it a desirable weapon for magical characters, such as a wizard in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
