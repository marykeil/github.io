## Literature Review

E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo), one of the most well-known and traditional gaming events, has been canceled permanently after nearly 30 years.




The popular gaming expo known as E3 has been officially retired after occurring almost annually for nearly 30 years. E3, an abbreviation for Electronic Entertainment Expo, has been happening since 1995, offering a space for developers and publishers to showcase their upcoming games and hardware to members of the industry, from shareholders to journalists, for instance.




Through an exclusive article, The Washington Post’s Gene Park broke the news that E3 had been canceled permanently by its organizer, ESA (Entertainment Software Association). The information was subsequently confirmed by a post made on the official E3 account on X.


 

The post made by ESA on E3’s account on X (formerly Twitter) mentions that “after more than two decades of E3, each one bigger than the last, the time has come to say goodbye.” The company thanks its attendees for “the memories.” The definitive cancelation comes after a few turbulent years in which ESA had to cancel E3 due to organizational problems, including the COVID-19 pandemic.


 E3’s Definitive Cancelation Was Not A Surprise 
          




E3’s definitive cancelation comes after a few turbulent years in which the ESA canceled events due to COVID-19 in 2020 and then again in 2022. ESA held a digital version of E3 in 2021, but even then, it seemed like the event was in trouble - with lukewarm reactions and underwhelming reveals. There were rumors that the traditional in-person event would happen again in 2022, but the pandemic still affected the organization and E3 was canceled a second time.

Earlier this year, E3 was canceled a third time, in light of companies pulling out of the event and holding their own showcases. The expo was also competing fiercely with Summer Game Fest. E3 was already largely considered “dead” by the industry, but there were still hopes that it would come back in full force in 2024. Nevertheless, ESA has confirmed the permanent retirement of the traditional expo, which unfortunately did not come across as much of a surprise.

E3 was an important part of the gaming industry’s history. The period in which the event was annually held was also contemplated by various showcases from major players, such as Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and many others. It was during E3 that many important games and consoles were announced, and where many developers and other personalities made their names. The death of E3 does not mean that the industry will come to a halt, but that times and interests have shifted, and that new games and names will arise through other means, including other events.
