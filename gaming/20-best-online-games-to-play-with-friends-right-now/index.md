## Literature Review

If you’ve been seeking that perfect title to play with your friends, you’ll need to investigate these solid multiplayer titles. 




While gaming has been known to be a solo experience for some, for others, it&#39;s a great way to connect with friends via complex narrative-driven titles like Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 or visceral FPS games like Counter-Strike. In fact, for those who live far from each other, gaming is a convenient way to reconnect and spend time with friends they wouldn&#39;t otherwise see in person. With the popularization of VoIP programs like Discord, talking to friends while playing games has never been easier.
However, because of all the great titles out there, it&#39;s sometimes hard to narrow down the choices and finally settle on a game. After all, everyone has their own gaming preferences, and some friends won&#39;t find certain games fun. Luckily, with all the options available through a myriad of gaming consoles and cross-platform play enabled on many titles, figuring out which game to play with friends has never been easier.

 18  Lethal Company (2023) 
Platforms: PC


 







  Critic   Score    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    IGN   7/10    
While by no means a polished game to any extent, Lethal Company is a new indie title developed by a small team called Zeekerss, who has worked on a few other indie titles over the past few years with very positive reviews on Steam. Lethal Company is the latest in Among Us type games, where teammates collect scrap and other items while wearing a hazmat suit and exploring abandoned bunkers for cash while cooperating with a pre-made or random team. The only catch is that hideous aliens and environmental disasters hide around every corner.
The game just released into Early Access on October 23, 2023, and there are still a lot of bugs to work out, but people online have already been making hilarious compilation videos of some of the funnier hazards in the game. Much like Phasmophobia, each time a mission is successful, it&#39;s possible to use acquired credits to get better gear to make recovery gear. With little to no direction and proximity voice chat, the scenarios in the game are unique and, at times, incredibly funny.





 17  The Jackbox Party Pack 10 (2023) 
        

  Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3.5/5    Metacritic   74    
The Jackbox Party Pack has been a mainstay in many households worldwide for years, with the fun trivia and mini-game style of play that has been popular since the franchise was established with You Don&#39;t Know Jack in the late 1990s. The Jackbox Party Pack 10 returns to the series with all-new mini-games, including &#34;Tee K.O. 2,&#34; &#34;FixyText,&#34; and time-travel trivia in the form of &#34;Timejinx.&#34;
 : The Best Jackbox Party Pack Games In 2023
Released on October 19, 2023, it continues the tradition of fun party games in an online format for up to nine players. Because many of the games are best suited with a large group and can accommodate eight to nine players, this is one game to check out if you&#39;ve got a large friend group.





 16  Grand Theft Auto Online (2013) 
Platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, PC


 







  Grand Theft Auto Online  


  Platform(s)    PC , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One     Released    October 1, 2013     Developer(s)    Rockstar Games , Rockstar North     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games    


  Critic   Score    Steam   Very Positive    Metacritic   80    
Though GTA: Online may not have reached the critical acclaim of Grand Theft Auto 5 or the other single-player experiences in the franchise, it would feel wrong not to consider the title one of the best online games to play with friends. Highly popular to this day, Grand Theft Online was originally released shortly after GTA 5, over a decade ago in 2013, and has since seen a plethora of regular updates to improve the experience. Packaged with the single-player experience, it&#39;s created a new avenue for fun in the world for those who have completed the campaign.

In GTA Online, players can create their own characters in the open world of San Andreas and Los Santos while interacting with the world&#39;s NPCs and other human-controlled characters. While a large and robust modding community and modded servers, people have taken the title to the next level by implementing special rules that dictate how people play. This has resulted in deeply immersive role-play servers and has generated a voracious fan base for the franchise and the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6.





 15  Don&#39;t Starve Together (2016) 
        

  Critic   Score    Metacritic   83    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    
Don&#39;t Starve Together is a standalone expansion for the survival game Don&#39;t Starve. With a Lovecraftian 2D aesthetic, people must team up to survive the dark wilderness and its dangers. Supporting up to six players at a time, users must locate resources, build production buildings, and fortify their shelters to evade the dreary beasts and scary entities that roam the land. With a spooky but cartoony aesthetic, Don&#39;t Starve Together tackles serious themes of survival with a very cool art style.
Though initially the mechanics for the game seem simple, it leads way to a deep and rather challenging game that&#39;s a great introduction to the survival genre of video games. Great for all ages, Don&#39;t Starve Together is a blast to play with friends or family online.





 14  Mortal Kombat 1 (2023) 
Platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC
        

  Mortal Kombat 1  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    September 19, 2023     Developer(s)    NetherRealm Studios     Genre(s)    Fighting , Horror    


  Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3.5/5    Steam   Mostly Positive    Metacritic   83    
For those seeking a solid fighting game experience and who would rather beat down their friends than play alongside them, Mortal Kombat 1 is the perfect game to pick up. MK1 is the highly-anticipated followup to 2019&#39;s Mortal Kombat 11, which saw Liu Kang ascend to a Fire God. Mortal Kombat 1, in many ways, is a reboot of the franchise, though it mostly follows the continuity established in the modern Mortal Kombat games. In the game&#39;s narrative, time is rebooted, giving way to a re-introduction of classic MK characters from previous games. Mortal Kombat 1 can be played offline in local mode or in private online lobbies.

Ultimately, while not as praised as Mortal Kombat 11, Mortal Kombat 1 still has time to solidify itself as one of the better MK games. The introduction of the Kameo mechanic, which is reminiscent of other assist-style fighting games, adds a new element to the gameplay, while the graphics and controls are the most updated iteration in the series so far.





 13  Deep Rock Galactic (2020)

  Critic   Score    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    Metacritic   85

Originally released on Xbox and PC in 2020, DRG has since evolved via the developers Ghost Ship Games, with close attention to the title over the years. Teams of dwarves team up to take on different missions cooperatively while overcoming hordes of alien bugs protecting the treasure.
Highly-addictive, the game requires precise teamwork as each person can take on different roles within the team to help accomplish the end goal of mining natural resources and extracting from the mission location. With constant updates and seasonal events, DRG is a game to check out for anyone who likes cooperative horde games.

The newest iteration of the title enables friends from across the globe to connect via Nintendo Switch Online and create custom lobbies to duke it out over the game&#39;s mini-games or main game format.

  Critic   Score    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    IGN   9/10    
Turning to survival, Valheim is an early-access multiplayer exploration and survival game based on Norse mythology and folklore. With up to 10-person parties, Valheim can accommodate a ton of players on a single-hosted server and is fairly reasonable regarding PC requirements. People can team up to discover the varying biomes in the game while taking out treacherous trolls and other dangerous creatures in the land.
            
 
 Valheim Hearth &amp; Home Update Review: Subtle, Yet Effective 
The highly anticipated Hearth &amp; Home Valheim update has arrived, adding new building options, rebalancing resources, and reinvigorating the game.



What makes this indie so amazing is just how deep the world is, and the gratifying sense of progression achieved from taming certain animals and getting better gear. Much like other survival titles, in Valheim, it&#39;s possible to craft different armor and weapons, build giant wooden and stone homes, and even sail on the game&#39;s vast ocean with a group of friends, making this certainly one of the best multiplayer online games to play right now.





 10  Total War: Warhammer 3 (2022) 
Platforms: PC


 







  Critic   Score    Metacritic   85    PC Gamer   90    
The grand epic Total War: Warhammer 3 is a culmination of years of development, starting with the first title in the franchise, which was released in 2016. Arguably, Creative Assembly&#39;s greatest franchise ever created, the Total War: Warhammer series of games utilizes the technology and base from the historical Total War titles that put the development company on the map.
Total War: Warhammer 3 refines the gameplay and UI while introducing all-new unique faction missions, quests, and mechanics. Though some of the game&#39;s features may feel dense, fast-paced RTS combat with massive armies helps break up more tedious grand strategy tasks like balancing the economy and dealing with diplomacy. With up to eight players in the grand campaign on the largest map that Creative Assembly has ever created -- combining the map from all three games -- it&#39;s one of the most engaging grand strategy games that one can play with friends.

  Counter-Strike 2  


  Platform(s)    Steam     Developer(s)    Valve     Publisher(s)    Valve     Genre(s)    Tactical , First-Person Shooter    


  Critic   Score    Steam   Very Positive    Metacritic   82    
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was originally developed in 2012 and is a follow-up to one of the longest-running FPS games in history. Counter-Strike 2 is the latest enhancement to the iconic first-person shooter. Valve has constantly updated, tweaked, and balanced the game throughout its lifespan to the point of near-perfection. Counter-Strike 2 is a culmination of these efforts with new additions and enhancements, including new volumetric smoke, updated maps, and improved tick rates.
 : Counter-Strike 2 Is Real &amp; Its New Features Are Game-Changing
Counter-Strike has been a staple in FPS games and is considered one of the greatest franchises ever created for the genre for its tight controls and highly-strategic gameplay. Creating a team to win competitive matches in CS2 is quite the challenge, but it&#39;s also one of the most fun games to play cooperatively with a group of friends once the underlying gameplay mechanics are learned.

That being said, it still stands as one of the most fun games to explore with friends to this day.

  Critic   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   86    
Diablo 4 is an ARPG developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The latest in the iconic Diablo franchise of games, the title follows a group of adventurers as they unravel the dark mystery behind the game&#39;s lead antagonist, Lilith. Diablo 4 can be played entirely solo, outside of team activities like PvP or World Boss encounters; however — playing with friends certainly makes the experience more fun. In addition, the different classes of Barbarian, Rogue, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Druid ensure that the entire group can find a character that suits their personality or playstyle.





 6  Tetris Effect: Connected (2020) 
Platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, Meta Quest
        

  Critic   Score    Metacritic   88    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive

 4  League of Legends (2009) 
Platforms: PC
        

  Critic   Score    Metacritic   78    IGN   9.2    
While it could be argued that playing League of Legends with friends has a greater chance of hurting a friendship than helping it, few titles can compete with LoL&#39;s popularity or deep gameplay theory and mechanics. While other games like DOTA may have started the MOBA trend, the 2009 game developed by Riot Games has had the staying power that many other games have been unable to achieve.
In League of Legends, friends can team up into teams of five and take control of 165 champions ranging from casters to tanks to damage dealers called a hard carry. Much like other MOBAs, LoL is a lot like a chess match, where the constant push and pull of the enemy and the ever-looming threat of the destruction of the team&#39;s Nexus hangs overhead. If one is looking for a strategic game that requires reflexes, intelligence, and teamwork, then there&#39;s arguably no better game than League of Legends.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder took the classic 2D side-scrolling action that made the Mario franchise iconic and incorporated cooperative elements to make the game fun for a group of people. There are several improvements made upon prior side-scrollers from Nintendo, including the ability to play a wide cast of characters in Super Mario Bros.

Wonder also has easier characters immune to damage, so younger generations can also enjoy the franchise.
Great for a wide range of different ages, Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduces the iconic side-scrolling Mario franchise to a whole new generation of players and updates the game with new mechanics, better graphics, and new, interesting features and game modes.

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the latest game in a trilogy of epic narrative-driven games in the Baldur&#39;s Gate franchise.
