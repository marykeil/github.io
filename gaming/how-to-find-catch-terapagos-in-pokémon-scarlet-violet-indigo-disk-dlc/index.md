## Literature Review

Even though the Terapagos is a guaranteed catch in the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, you&#39;ll have to put up a worthy fight to obtain it.





Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC.




The good news is that catching a Terapagos is not a game of luck or chance; everyone is guaranteed to encounter and catch the Legendary Pokémon as it is tied to the main story. Therefore, it&#39;s just a matter of hitting some milestones in the story before you get your chance to catch a Terapagos, much like how you find and catch Iron Boulder in Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk.

                  Every Scarlet &amp; Violet Version Exclusive In Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC doubles the number of version exclusives compared to The Teal Mask, and it&#39;s helpful to know the full list.   


 How To Unlock Terapagos in Indigo Disk DLC 
          

You can&#39;t start your encounter with the Terapagos until you have first defeated all four BB Elite Four Trials. Following that, you need to fight and beat BB League Champion Kieran as part of the story. After this battle, Ms. Briar will invite you, Carmine, and Kieran to explore a new part of Area Zero. This is where you will encounter the Terapagos for the first time in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC.




Once you take the elevator down from the Lab, explore the area until you see some crystals blocking a doorway and some glowing Pokémon (Stellar Tera Type form) nearby defending it. Just past this point, Keiran will pull out a crystal that will transform into a Terapagos. Kieran will then pull out a Master Ball, catch the Terapagos, and challenge you to a fight.

After you come out on top in this fight, a cutscene will play in which the Terapagos escapes its Master Ball, Terastilizes, and challenges you, Carmine, and Kieran to a Raid Battle. After defeating the Terapagos in this second-phase battle, you can catch it without restraint in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk.

Terapagos Stats &amp; Abilities
When you first capture the Terapagos, it will be level 85 and will have the following stats and abilities:

  Stat   Score    HP   90    Attack   65    Defense   85    Sp. Attack   65    Sp. Defense   85    Speed   60   






  Tera Shift: When the Pokémon enters a battle, it absorbs the energy around itself and transforms into its Terastal Form.   Tera Shell: The Pokémon’s shell contains the powers of each type. All damage-dealing moves hitting the Pokémon when its HP is full will be ineffective.   Teraform Zero: When Terapagos changes into its Stellar Form, it uses its hidden powers to eliminate all effects of weather and terrain, reducing them to zero.  



 How To Beat &amp; Catch Terapagos 
          

Terapagos is a Normal-type Pokémon and is weak to Fighting-type. However, it&#39;s crucial you don&#39;t use a Fighting-type in your first battle against the Terapagos and Kieran. If you do, the Terapagos will take the form of a Fighting-type in the second phase, making its already stronger version even more challenging to defeat. As a result, you should save and use your best Fighting-type Pokemon for the second phase to increase your chances of success.




In any case, back-to-back battles against the Terapagos will be challenging. However, it&#39;s well worth the fight as winning both will net you one of the best Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.
