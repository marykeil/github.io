## Literature Review

After a long development cycle and many delays, Skull and Bones has finally received a final release date, along with a beta and pre-order options.




Skull and Bones has been a very long time coming, but there&#39;s finally a concrete end in sight. Starting development in 2013, Skull and Bones was intended to build on the systems built for Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag and capitalize off of that title&#39;s enormous popularity to drive interest in another pirate title. Although it would seem like this could have been a slam-dunk proposition, the development has been anything but that, with repeated delays and reports of frequent internal changes of direction leading to a long period of limbo that cast its eventual release into doubt.




Things started to possibly come together in 2022, when a November 8 release date and a shift to current-generation consoles were announced. That didn&#39;t take long to become March 9 of the following year, however, which then slid into a 2023-2024 time frame. The finish line is finally closing in, however, with a recent closed beta, extensive gameplay reveals, and the announcement of a new release date and pre-orders indicating a lack of much room for further delays to come into play.

 When Skull And Bones Releases 
          

The Game Awards 2023 showcased a Skull and Bones trailer that revealed the official release date for the game, now available on the official Ubisoft YouTube channel. The long-suffering game is now slated for February 16, 2024, coming in cleanly within the most recently promised window for its launch. The Skull and Bones release plan follows the recent trend of providing early access to anyone who opts for a deluxe package, with buyers of the planned Premium Edition getting access three days early on February 13, 2024. This extra jump is also available for anyone with Ubisoft&#43;, the gaming subscription service available from the publisher.





 

The big difference between this release date and prior planned launches for Skull &amp; Bones is the availability of pre-orders, which prove a level of commitment and belief in getting the game out the door in time that wasn&#39;t present in the past. Pre-orders are open for copies on Windows (through either Ubisoft Connect or Epic Games), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. It&#39;s also planned to launch on the Amazon Luna cloud gaming platform, with a canceled release on the now-defunct Google Stadia showing just how long its been in development.



 Skull And Bones Gameplay Details 
         




The big focus of Skull and Bones is naval combat, a standout feature in Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag that now gets to truly dominate the spotlight. Various upgrade systems make it possible to tweak and refine the abilities of a ship in combat, from guns and armor to the furniture that decorates it. Not every moment of the game occurs on the sea, but ports seem to mostly act as hubs for taking contracts and purchasing upgrades. Boarding ships and hand-to-hand combat likewise doesn&#39;t seem to be a part of the experience.

Skull and Bones leaves the most common piratical setting of the Caribbean behind for a foray into the Indian Ocean during the second golden age of piracy. It&#39;s possible to explore this open-world environment either alone or in co-op play, making it possible to take on enemies with a coalition of player-controlled ships. After rising through the ranks, players can transition from running tasks for other pirates to operating their own scheme. This also opens up a little more on-land play with smuggling operations that include crafting valuable cargo out of resources to carry on the open waters in risky runs.






 Beta Access For Skull And Bones 
          

Anyone unsure about Skull and Bones can attempt to play it early in the newest closed beta for the game, which will run from December 14 to December 18 in US time zones according to a page on the official Ubisoft website. This window is preceded by preloads opening on December 12, and the PC required space of 65GB implies that the file size that needs to be downloaded should be close to that number. Although the beta will be available across the full course of the window, a time cap of six hours is applied for each user, so binging it heavily across several days won&#39;t be possible.

As a  d Beta, the experience is invitation only, so signing up doesn&#39;t guarantee an opportunity to play. Each invitee can add two of their friends, however, so assembling a pirate band shouldn&#39;t be hard as long as everyone involved has a Ubisoft Connect account. Maxing the game at a 4K resolution requires a beefy PC, with a recommended GPU of an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, but low settings at 1080p work on a more manageable GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 5500 XT.




                  How Ubisoft Connect Is Different Than Uplay (&amp; What Games Use It)   The new service will connect players across all platforms, including cloud gaming services, and will work with future releases &amp; select older games.   

The closed beta focuses on the hub area of Sainte Anne in the Red Isles, where John Scurlock rules as a Kingpin who can offer captains missions to take on. It doesn&#39;t sound like the beta will be too heavily geographically restricted, however, as it will be possible to set sail beyond the boundaries of the Red Isles to explore the Coast of Africa and the Open Seas. The  d Beta isn&#39;t under an NDA, so no restrictions are placed on streaming or taking screenshots of the Skull and Bones gamplay experience. The beta offers a few rewards for players who complete specific goals.

 Skull And Bones Edition Differences 
          

Skull and Bones has a simpler release strategy than some recent Ubisoft titles, opting for two editions in total. The standard edition simply comes with the game and has a price tag of $59.99 on PC and $69.99 on consoles. The Premium edition adds two extra missions, a battle pass token, artbook, bonus pack with an extra outfit and cosmetics, and the aforementioned three day early access for $89.99 on PC and $99.99 on consoles. Players will be able to judge for themselves whether these editions are worthwhile when Skull and Bones finally releases.
