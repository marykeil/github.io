## Literature Review

A remarkable event unfolded during the Archon Quests added with Genshin Impact 4.2, but it also raised important questions about Teyvat.




There was a major lore bomb dropped in Genshin Impact 4.2 that revealed important details about the world of Teyvat but still instigated further curiosity by leaving some other questions unanswered. Version 4.2 is the most recent addition to the live-service game by HoYoverse, and concludes the main story arc in the region of Fontaine in Genshin Impact, after the Nation of Justice’s debut earlier this year. Although the main focus is on the region reigned by the element of Hydro, there are other developments in the story.

Aside from the individual struggles that each Nation in Teyvat faces, the game also follows the drama of the Traveler’s search for their long-lost sibling, as well as a better understanding of the events that shaped the world as it is. This includes the downfall of Khaenri&#39;ah during the Cataclysm, the Archons, and the Heavenly Principles. The existence of the Descenders in Genshin Impact is also an important element in play in the overall story, and new information about them has just been revealed with Version 4.2.

                  Is Skirk Playable In Genshin Impact 4.2? Newest Character Explained   Skirk finally made her debut in Genshin Impact 4.2. Here is everything known about the new character so far, including her connection to the Abyss.   


 Genshin Impact 4.2 Reveals Important Information About Gnoses 
          




After beating the All-Devouring Whale in the Archon Quest “The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur” in Chapter IV: Act V, Neuvillette and the Traveler encounter Skirk in Genshin Impact. Once the Traveler leaves and Neuvillette extends the conversation with her, Skirk tells him that Gnoses are “remains of the Third Descender.” The Primordial One, also known as the Usurper, came to Teyvat and destroyed the seven sovereign dragons and, with the help of the Second Who Came, then crafted the Gnoses as a symbol for the gods to exert control over the world. These major bits of information, however, instigated more questions than answers about the mysteries of Teyvat.



 The Third Descender Comes Into Play In Genshin Impact 4.2 
          

One of the most important inquiries brought up by Genshin Impact&#39;s lore bomb regarding the Gnoses is about the identity of the Third Descender. Because the Traveler is referred to as the Fourth Descender, this is the person who came to Teyvat before the main character – and if Gnoses are their remains, they are dead. The other important question is about how and why the Third Descender died. So far, there are no concrete answers, and it is likely that only small pieces of information will be revealed over time. However, it does seem like those in possession of Gnoses may also be carrying an item forged in death.




There are several indicators that the Heavenly Principles may be evil – especially after seeing how they punished the original Hydro Archon – but if they are also the Primordial One, then this would be more solid evidence that they are the oppressive ruler of Teyvat that eliminated the dragons and used their elemental Authority to forge the Archons’ seats. Seeing that they may have a connection to the creation of the Gnoses, it also raises suspicions that the Third Descender may have been killed. Nevertheless, players will have to wait for more Archon Quests in Genshin Impact to uncover additional details.
