## Literature Review

The Best Team Combinations in Pokémon GO contain Pokémon that are super-effective against a wide variety of opponents improving your chances.





Some Pokémon are great options to start a battle with, while others specialize in being able to switch in for bad match-ups or to close out battles once an opponent&#39;s shields have been used. Pokémon GO does run other special events with different requirements, but the three main categories for teams are Great League (1500 max CP), Ultra League (2,500 max CP), or Master League (Any CP). During different times of the season, these will be available for you to compete in as part of the GO Battle League. You will also be able to use any combination of teams you want when facing Team GO Rocket and Leader Giovanni.









 








 10  Togekiss, Origin Forme Giratina, &amp; Dialga (Master League) 
A Core All-Around Team
        

While the best individual Pokémon don&#39;t always work well together, the key to earning more victories is having a good all-round team built for several situations and different possible opponents. For Master League, which allows you to use Pokémon of any CP, Togekiss, Giratina, and Dialga are a great all-round team that will always have a chance on the battlefield.
Most of the Pokémon you will meet in Master League are Legendary or Mythical, Togekiss is fantastic to combat them. The Fairy- and Flying- type is super effective against the many Dragon opponents who you will likely meet and it is also great support alongside your power attackers. Dragon- and Steel-type Dialga is a Pokémon that can deal huge damage quickly, especially if equipped with Dragon Breath, which is vital in PvP matches.
Finally, the Dragon- and Ghost-type Giratina Origin Forme has been one of the most dominating Pokémon since entering Pokémon GO and works well alongside the other two.





 9  Dragonite, Mewtwo, &amp; Ho-Oh (Master League) 
Old Favorites Shine in the Top League


 







Master League lends itself to a wide variety of teams in Pokémon GO. However, three old favorites form to make one of the most powerful teams available. Unsurprisingly, the Generation One Legendary Psychic-type Mewtwo is one of the strongest attackers in the game, even if it can&#39;t take many hits when in a bad match-up. Shadow Mewtwo has been available in takeover events for players to capture.
In the Master League, Dragon- and Flying-type Dragonite is one of the few non-Legendary Pokémon that is effective in PvP, and while lots of players will use Dragon-type counters, it has fast attacks available that can do damage quickly. Rounding out the team is the Fire- and Flying-type Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, the strongest Fire-type available in Pokémon GO. It is a well-balanced team of three great attackers, with the types of moves to take on the majority of opponents and being too strong for AI teams.





 8  Charizard, Giratina, &amp; Walrein (Ultra League) 
The Strongest Pokémon
        

Ho-Oh is only effective once its level has been increased, so a great Fire-type for the Ultra League is fan favorite Charizard. The Gen 1 Fire- and Flying- type is a great option in Ultra League and can be stacked with several different type moves.
Legendary Giratina is seen as the strongest Pokémon by most in the Ultra League, and so the majority of strong combinations include it. However, balance is vital in picking the best team combinations, and by using Ice- and Water-type Walrein, you have counters for lots of Pokémon that can take on the first two members of the line-up. It can also be given Ice- type attacks which can prove very useful against specific opponents such as Ground types or Grass types.





 7  Gligar, Dubwool, &amp; Carbink (Great League) 
The Perfect Type Match-Ups
        

While lots of the best team combinations in Pokémon GO have been part of the Meta gameplay for several Seasons, one of the best new line-ups is Gligar, Dubwool, and Carbink. Carbink is one of the newer additions in the game and is one of the hardest Pokémon to defeat, being able to take a huge amount of attacks, while being able to chip away at its opponents.
It also has a unique Rock- and Fairy- type which performs very well in certain match-ups, as well as sitting well alongside Flying- and Ground-type Gligar and Normal-type Dubwool. Dubwool&#39;s strength in PvP matches is its ability to learn Fighting- move Double Kick, which is super-effective against a number of the regular Great League Pokémon.
Normal-types perform better in Pokémon GO than they do in the traditional games in the series due to not having many direct weaknesses. 






 6  Swampert, Gligar, &amp; Registeel (Great League) 
A Balanced Line-Up


 







Sometimes the highest-rated and strongest Pokémon already work well together to perform and that is the case with this team. According to PvPoke Registeel, Swampert, and Gligar are all some of the best options for Great League and can be used in several possible combinations, including together. Swampert is widely regarded as one of the Meta Pokémon across several Leagues, especially in the Great League. It has a unique dual typing of Water- and Ground- giving it very few weaknesses, including among those that are commonly used in PvP battles.
Steel-type Registeel is bulky, can frustrate opponents, and has very few weaknesses, becoming a great option as a defender in battles. Gligar is the perfect third choice to join these two, with a Ground- and Flying-type that is only weak to a couple of types of attacks, meaning no single Pokémon will be strong against this team.





 5  Altered Forme Giratina, Trevenant, &amp; Swampert (Ultra League) 
Ghost-Types Ruling in Battle
        

The two strongest types in Pokémon GO are Dragon and Ghost, which means the Legendary Giratina in its Altered Forme, as a Dragon- and Ghost-type- type ticks a lot of boxes. Ghost- and Grass-type Trevenant also have a unique type and perform well against many of the main options that trainers use in Ultra League. However, it needs to be near max level to reach 2,500, meaning XL candies will be required.
While Swampert is strong in Great League it is still very effective in the Ultra League with very few opponents where it is at a big disadvantage. While certain types can defeat this combination of Pokémon in Ultra League, its two Ghost-types backed up by Swampert give it a significant advantage over a number of the other Meta teams.
If you find yourself playing a lot against regular opponents, this team can be a great choice. 






 4  Groudon, Kyurem, &amp; Hero Zacian (Master League) 
Tough to Beat Powerhouses
        

With so many options in Master League, using a different team gives yourself a chance of victory and this team of Legendaries offers a lot of power. Gen 3 Legendary Ground-type Groudon offers an alternative to many of the popular lead Pokémon that are used in Master League, as well as only being weak against, Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks.
At the other end of the battle Gen 8 Zacian (Hero) is a Fairy-type that is only weak to Poison- or Steel-type attacks, of which there aren&#39;t many that are used regularly in Ultra League. Its attacks are effective against the majority of opponents, meaning it is great to end matches.
Another Legendary, Kyurem matches up as well with the other two as an option that can be switched to if you are struggling. It is a Dragon- and Ice-type, so can make use of some of the best fast attacks.
            
 
 All Ditto Disguises In Pokémon GO (December 2023) 
Ditto has a very unqiue catching method in Pokémon GO and can appear as eight different Pokémon spanning across the first six Generations.








 3  Dialga, Melmetal, &amp; Mewtwo (Master League) 
Dominating Legendaries
        

As mentioned in an early combination, you can&#39;t go wrong in selecting the powerful Mewtwo, due to its strength in attack and defense, along with the effectiveness of its Psychic-type attacks. The best combination, to pair the Psychic- type with is Dragon- and Steel- type Dialga and Steel- type Melmetal. Across all of the different Leagues Steel- types are a great choice.
Melmetal is the strongest of the Steel- types with a huge CP, that can max out at over 4,000 which allows it to stand a lot of attacks. Dialga once again can use its powerful Dragon-type attacks that are needed to succeed in Master League matches.





 2  Registeel, Cresselia, &amp; Swampert (Ultra League) 
Ultra League&#39;s Top Team
        

When entering Ultra League matches the current strongest team to go with is Registeel, Cresselia, and Swampert. The Steel-type Registeel is great as an opening or closing Pokémon, due to its fantastic defense, as well as being strong enough to take others down.
Swampert is another choice good enough to excel in both the Great and Ultra League, due to its typing and the nature of its attacks. Adding Psychic-Type Cresselia to the mix provides a balanced team of strong attackers that have all long been classed as being Meta in the Ultra League.





 1  Azumarill, Galarian Stunfisk, &amp; Walrein (Great League) 
All-Around Package for Great League


 







The Great League is often the one that most Trainers like to play, with a CP cap of 1500, giving opportunities to different teams and this one has been a powerful meta option since the GBL started. While certain Pokémon can combat this line-up, between them, they are super-effective against the majority of opponents you can face. Azumarill has continued to be a strong Pokémon in Great League with only a few weaknesses among the other most common types you will come up against.
Galarian Stunfish&#39;s unique typing means it has very few weaknesses and has powerful fast and charge moves at its disposal. In Great League, there aren&#39;t many strong Grass- or Electric- types meaning Water-types feature heavily, and having a second bulky option in Water- and Ice-type Walrein can support the team. It provides further cover for Stunfisk and its Ice-type attacks are super effective against Dragon-, Grass-, Ground-, and Flying-types in Pokémon GO.
