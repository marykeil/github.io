## Literature Review

As Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 progresses the party will gain access to more powerful spells, so knowing which ones to choose is key with limited spell slots.





Spells in BG3 stop at level six, unlike Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which goes as high as ninth level. By the time the party reaches the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the spellcasters will have access to and be using fifth and sixth-level spells which can offer some very powerful effects. From healing and buffs to damage dealing and extra backup, these spells are worth adding to any party&#39;s spellbook.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Cone Of Cold (Level Five Evocation) 
Sorcerers, Wizards, Fiend Warlocks, Circle Of The Land Druids
        

Cone of cold is a fifth-level spell which is great for AOE damage and interacts nicely with environmental conditions like wet to deal extra damage. With this spell, casters can blast out a nine-meter/30-foot cone of freezing magic which deals 8d8 of cold damage. All targets within the cone must make Constitution saves, and take half damage on a success, while any water on the ground is frozen into ice.
Icy surfaces are considered difficult terrain and any creature moving across them has a chance to slip and fall prone. 






 9  Dominate Person (Level Five Enchantment) 
Bards, Sorcerers, Wizards, Archfey Warlocks, Great Old One Warlocks, Trickery Clerics, Knowledge Clerics
        

Dominate person is a powerful spell that allows the caster to take control of another humanoid. This spell targets one humanoid who is not already allied with the party, and they must succeed on a Wisdom Saving throw or be forced to fight alongside the caster. Dominate person is a great spell when surrounded by enemies to get a little extra help, although players cannot control them directly.
Each time the dominated target takes damage they will reroll their Wisdom save so this can be most effective on enemy spellcasters or healers who aren&#39;t directly taking damage. 






 8  Mass Cure Wounds (Level Five Evocation) 
Bards, Clerics, Druids
        

When going up against monsters and illithids it&#39;s important to have some healing spells prepared to keep the party on their feet. Mass cure wounds is a great spell that targets all allies within 18 meters/60-feet of the caster for 3d8 plus the caster&#39;s spellcasting modifier hit points.
It cannot be overstated how good it is to be able to give the entire party a quick injection of health with a single spell and can make all the difference in difficult boss fights in BG3. 






 7  Sunbeam (Level Six Evocation) 
Druids, Sorcerers, Wizards


Sunbeam is a fantastic damage spell that can be cast, and then recast on subsequent turns without using a spell slot, so long as the caster maintains concentration. Dealing out a whopping 6d8 radiant damage in a line, sunbeam can also blind all targets who fail their Constitution saving throw. It is also possible to get this level six spell as early as Act 1, by picking up the legendary mace The Blood of Lathander.





 6  Chain Lightning (Level Six Evocation) 
Sorcerers, Wizards


For a powerful spell that can hit multiple enemies with a hit spell slot, then look no further than chain lightning. With this spell casters can target one enemy within range who will have to make a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d8 lightning damage. After this three more bolts will leap out striking other enemies close to the original target which all must then make their own saves or take the full damage.
Sorcerers can use Sorcery Points to use Metamagic: Twinned Spell with chain lightning as it counts as a single target spell. This can quickly take out large groups of enemies and deal extra damage to all in the surrounding area if they have the wet condition. 






 5  Heal (Level Six Evocation) 
Clerics, Druids
        

Heal is the highest-level healing spell in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and can grant a single target a substantial amount of hit points. With heal, the caster can target a creature within range to give them 70 hit points with no need to roll as well as remove any blindness or diseases. This is a powerful healing spell but is limited by only targeting one creature, but can easily heal squishier party members to full health in tough fights.
There is an interesting interaction between the Dark Urge and heal, where memories can be restored. The memories will differ depending on whether Orin has been dealt with. 






 4  Otto&#39;s Irresistible Dance (Level Six Enchantment) 
Bards, Wizards
        

Otto&#39;s irresistible dance is a really weird BG3 spell that forces targets to dance uncontrollably, leaving them unable to take actions or move. There is no initial saving throw, although targets can make Wisdom saves on their turns to try and shake off the effects. Otherwise, Otto&#39;s irresistible dance lasts for 10 turns and grants advantage on attack rolls against the dancer.





 3  Planar Ally (Level Six Conjuration) 
Clerics


Although BG3 lets the player take companions out with them on their adventures, there are times when four people just aren&#39;t enough to deal with the threat. Having spells that summon creatures to aid the party can come in handy all through BG3 and at higher levels Planar Ally is a fantastic spell to have.
The spell summons an otherworldly being to join the party until the next long rest with three choices: djinni, deva, and cambion. Each has their own abilities and a decent number of hit points to make them valuable new members of the team.





 2  Disintegrate (Level Six Transmutation) 
Sorcerers, Wizards
        

For sheer power, look no further than disintegrate, a powerful higher-level spell with two awesome effects. With this spell, the caster targets a single creature, who must make a Dexterity saving throw or take an insane 10d6&#43;40 force damage. As if that wasn&#39;t enough to obliterate most enemies, disintegrate lives up to its name by leaving those reduced to zero hit points nothing but a pile of ash, making it great against groups of enemies with the ability to resurrect.





 1  Heroes&#39; Feast (Level Six Conjuration) 
Clerics, Druids
        

Heroes&#39; Feast is a brilliantly powerful buff in Baldurâ€™s Gate 3, and one that will be needed when facing off against Act 3&#39;s bosses. The spell conjures a contained with camp supplies and water with can be added to the party&#39;s horde of food but also increases all affected target&#39;s hit point maximum by 12. On top of that, heroes&#39; feast also gives immunity to diseases, poisons, frightened condition, and all Wisdom saving throws will have advantage.
Heroes&#39; feast lasts until the next long rest, but with it being a sixth-level spell, it is tempting to save that spell slot for more powerful damage spells. However, as the radius of Heroes&#39; Feast is so large it is possible for Shadowheart, Halsin, Jaheira or a hireling to cast this, hit all companions, and then be left at camp. Heroes&#39; feast also affects summoned party members such as familiars, ranger companions, and Planar Ally.
