## Literature Review

Players might pick up a title for any number of reasons, but these video games have such compelling stories that truly stand the test of time.




Story-driven games are still as popular as ever, offering players a chance to lose themselves in a fictional world that&#39;s less passive than watching a movie or TV show. Where multiplayer games can bring people together, single player narrative-centric games give users a chance to step into the shoes of someone else to experience something entirely new across any genre they can think of, whether it be horror, drama, or even romance.
When it comes to narrative-driven games there are plenty to choose from in both the AAA and indie game spheres, but some stand apart from the others. Here are 10 best story-driven games of all time, selected because of their immersion, characters, and of course, their stories.

 10  Until Dawn (2014) 
Platforms: PlayStation 4


 







  Until Dawn  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4     Released    August 25, 2015     Developer(s)    Supermassive Games     Publisher(s)    Sony     Genre(s)    Survival Horror , Action-Adventure    


Supermassive Games skyrocketed to infamy with its 2014 release of Until Dawn. With a star-studded cast including Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, this narrative-driven horror game lets players decide who lives and who dies based on their story choices. Filled with twists and turns, grisly deaths, and a memorable script heavily inspired by some of the best horror movie tropes out there, Until Dawn is a must-play story game for horror fans.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   79    PlayStation Store   4.6/5    





 9  The Walking Dead Season 1 (2012) 
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Mobile
        

Often regarded as the best The Walking Dead game, Telltale&#39;s first foray into the franchise is a masterclass in narrative design. Similar to Until Dawn, players must make decisions that will often decide the fate of the characters on-screen. The zombie apocalypse is the perfect setting for a choice-based game, but what&#39;s perhaps unexpected is just how much this game can tug on the heartstrings - this is certainly one of the most emotional stories seen in any video game.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   89    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    





 8  The House In Fata Morgana (2012) 
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PC, Mobile
        

The House in Fata Morgana (and its later edition, Dreams of the Revenants), is about as story-driven as a video game can be: as a visual novel, its gameplay mostly involves reading through the stories presented across different doorways in time. Players will meet an unusual and memorable cast of characters as they begin to unravel the mysterious past of the titular house throughout various periods in time. Gruesome, heartbreaking, and entirely unforgettable, the underrated House in Fata Morgana is the pinnacle of its genre.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   96    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    





 7  Portal 2 (2011) 
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Mobile
        

  Portal 2  


  Platform(s)    Windows , macOS , Linux , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , Nintendo Switch     Released    April 18, 2011     Developer(s)    Valve     Publisher(s)    Valve     Genre(s)    Puzzle , Platformer    


Portal 2 could have been a run-of-the-mill sequel with some interesting gameplay elements, but the imagination of the developers at Valve extended far past the mechanics underneath the hood of the experience. Portal 2 is instead far more intriguing because of its story. The partnership the player forms with their robotic partner takes such a surprising turn, but it&#39;s not just the final villainous shift that takes audiences by surprise. Valve Corporation has created an unparalleled sci-fi world and unforgettable puzzle game that&#39;s boosted tremendously by the adventures set within it.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   95    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    





 6  Disco Elysium (2019) 
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S, Nintendo Switch


 







  Disco Elysium  


  Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , macOS     Released    October 15, 2019     Developer(s)    ZA/UM     Publisher(s)    ZA/UM     Genre(s)    Adventure    


Disco Elysium is one of the best games of the last 20 years, serving as a narrative adventure that challenges what to expect from a video game. Its sharp and witty dialogue makes it a wonderfully intricate and immersive experience with hundreds of hours of replayability. Players take on the role of a detective with amnesia who must solve a murder, and despite its silly-on-paper premise, players can expect a deeply emotional story with a healthy dose of humor and a beautifully bleak world to explore.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   91    Steam (The Final Cut)   Very Positive    Screen Rant   4.5/5    





 5  Bioshock (2007) 
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch
        

Bioshock is the first game to spring to mind for many when discussing narrative stories - and for good reason. Players explore the underwater world of Rapture as plane crash survivor Jack, but this once-eutopia has fallen to ruin and chaos with danger lurking around every corner. As players follow the instructions of the mysterious Andrew Ryan, what unfolds is one of the most unforgettable narrative twists ever seen in a game and well worth experiencing for oneself.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   96    Steam   Very Positive    





 4  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 (2023) 
Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5


 







  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3  


  Platform(s)    macOS , Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5     Released    August 31, 2023     Developer(s)    Larian Studios     Publisher(s)    Larian Studios     Genre(s)    RPG    


Winner of The Game Awards Game of the Year 2023 - as well as Screen Rant&#39;s Game of the Year - Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a phenomenal leap in narrative design and storytelling. The game boasts thousands of different endings depending on the player&#39;s choices throughout and - being a game set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons - there&#39;s a wealth of lore and story to unpack even after putting the game down. There&#39;s no end to what can happen in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, making it one of the biggest and widest story-driven games out there.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   96    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    Screen Rant   4.5/5    





 3  God of War (2018) 
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4
        

  God of War  


  Platform(s)    PlayStation 4     Released    April 20, 2018     Developer(s)    Santa Monica Studio     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment    


Rebooting the God of War franchise was certainly an ambitious feat. However, the decision to move the story into the realms of Norse mythology and focus on the bond between Kratos and his son paid off. The game is one of the most popular story-driven first-party PlayStation releases and is considered a must-play for PlayStation - and PC - users. Making Kratos far more relatable by creating a story of fatherhood contrasts well with the monsters and deities that he faces, with the story itself serving as an emotional rollercoaster of mythical proportions.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   94    Steam   Overwhelmingly Positive    Screen Rant   5/5    





 2  Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) 
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One
        

  Red Dead Redemption 2  


  Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , Microsoft Windows , Stadia     Released    October 26, 2018     Developer(s)    Rockstar Studios     Publisher(s)    Rockstar Games     Genre(s)    Action , Open-World , Western , Adventure    


Open-world titles can sometimes struggle to truly tell a story that grips the audience, with the focus of these games generally being on exploration and combat over the narrative. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a big exception, building on the franchise with a deeply emotional story that has cemented protagonist Arthur Morgan as one of the most notable video game characters of all time.
With a gritty but heroic lead and the opportunity to truly do anything, it&#39;s a shock that the narrative at the core continues to be both starkly relevant and the most exciting aspect of the game. It&#39;s gripping from the start, and Rockstar Games ensures it absolutely makes the most of the genre as rival forces continue to cause great concern to the player in an interwoven set of plots.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   97    Steam   Very Positive    





 1  The Last Of Us Part 1 (2022) 
Platforms: PlayStation 5, PC


 







  The Last of Us: Part 1  


  Franchise    The Last of Us     Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 5 , Steam     Released    September 2, 2022     Developer(s)    Naughty Dog     Publisher(s)    Sony Interactive Entertainment     Genre(s)    Action-Adventure , Survival , Narrative    


2022 saw the remastered release of one of Sony&#39;s biggest games of all time: The Last of Us. While many were unhappy to see a 2013 PlayStation 3 game that already had a PS4 remaster get yet another version for PS5, TLOU remains one of the most gripping and harrowing video game stories of all time. The Last of Us for PS4 is rated higher than the PS5 version with a Metacritic score of 95, but from a storytelling perspective, either version is a must-play depending on one&#39;s available hardware.
Set in a post-apocalyptic world,The Last of Us follows the story of smuggler Joel Miller, tasked with smuggling teenager Ellie across the wasteland of the US after it&#39;s discovered she may be immune to the cordyceps virus that&#39;s destroyed the planet. A story of love, loss, and morality, The Last of Us Part 1 is the definitive way to experience the now-classic Naughty Dog adventure.
  Website   Review Score    Metacritic   88    Steam   Mixed    Screen Rant   4.5/5
