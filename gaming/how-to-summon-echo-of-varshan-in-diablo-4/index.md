## Literature Review

One of the endgame bosses in Season 2 of Diablo 4, the Echo of Varshan, must be summoned by collecting or crafting body parts from the undead monster.





Varshan&#39;s boss encounter is tied to the Tree of Whispers, a place in northern Hawezar where you can complete Whisper of the Dead activities for different rewards. If you are playing within World Tier 4 in Diablo 4, you should be able to see the Malignant Burrow dungeon on your map close to the Tree. Proceed with caution if your character is at a lower level, since this location is recommended for anyone who is Level 75 or higher.

 How to Unlock the Echo of Varshan Boss in Diablo 4 
          

To unlock and summon the Echo of Varshan, you have to collect Parts of Varshan&#39;s Body, including the Trembling Hand, Blackened Femur, and Gurgling Head items. These are obtained from Grotesque Debtors, enemies that you face during the Whispers of the Dead events provided by the Tree of Whispers. Combining a Malignant Heart with the Parts in the Burrow dungeon activates the ritual in Diablo 4, making Varshan appear.



The Malignant Hearts in Season 2 of Diablo 4 are not the same as the items from Season 1, which could be placed into slots to add skill modifiers to your character.




You have to use the required items multiple times if you want to summon Varshan more than once. Thankfully, you are able to craft Parts of Varshan&#39;s Body if you do not want to grind Whispers of the Dead in Diablo 4. Visit an Alchemist vendor in Sanctuary to learn the crafting recipes for each Part, with each costing at least one Malignant Heart and several Rare Materials like Veiled Crystals to make.




Make sure you are fully prepared to fight Varshan by being a part of a team as you delve into the Malignant Burrow to perform the summoning ritual. Wiping to the boss will force you to gather all the Parts again, which can become a tedious process if you lose again and again. The best way to summon the Echo of Varshan in Diablo IV is with a number of allies at your side, where you have a better chance of victory.
