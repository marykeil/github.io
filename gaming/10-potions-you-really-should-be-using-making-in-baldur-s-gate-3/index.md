## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has tons of great potions to find, purchase, and craft, but players should keep these 10 in their inventory at all times.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has tons of amazing equipment for the party to hunt down to make sure they are at their very best when taking on mind flayers. However, that&#39;s not the only tool at their disposal, as among the other brilliant features of the game is the alchemy system, which allows all manner of potions to be crafted. From boosts in battle to an alternative to spells, there are some potions and elixirs in BG3 that every party should keep an eye out for.
For its full release, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 included many features that weren&#39;t available during early access, with alchemy being one of the most notable. The alchemy system allows the combining of different ingredients found throughout the world or purchased from vendors to create powerful potions for the party. Thesepotions can buff, heal, grant extra abilities, or even restore class abilities, making them extremely useful resources to use right through to the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Potion Of Feather Fall 
Ingredients: Sublimate Of Autumn Crocus &amp; Any Essence


 







Feather fall is a fantastically useful spell that allows the party to leap from high places without the fear of taking fall damage, lasting for 10 turns. This can really open up the battlefield and help with exploration in several key areas in BG3. However, not every party wants to have a spellcaster constantly present or may get caught without the spell prepared at a crucial moment. The Potion of Feather Fall does exactly the same as the spell and can either be drunk individually to affect one character or thrown on the ground for an AOE.





 9  Elixir Of Arcane Cultivation 
Ingredients: Vitriol Of Weavemoss &amp; Any Sublimate (Standard Version)


 







The Elixir of Arcane Cultivation is a must-have for any spellcasters in the party, particularly those who do not recover spell slots via short rests or class features, or those with lower numbers of spell slots such as warlocks. This elixir allows the drinker to gain an extra first level spell slot, allowing them to cast just that little bit more. There are four variations of Arcane Cultivation elixirs: standard, greater, superior, and supreme, which provide a first-level, second-level, third-level, or fourth-level spell slot, respectively.
Unlike potions, the effects of elixirs, unless stated otherwise, will last until a long rest or until another elixir is drunk. 






 8  Elixir Of Viciousness 
Ingredients: Vitriol Of Shadowroot Sac &amp; Any Ashes
        

The Elixir of Viciousness is a fantastically handy potion to have in a fight with particularly difficult enemies or bosses in BG3. When drunk, this elixir reduces the number needed for a critical hit by one and, best of all, it stacks with other effects that also reduce this number. Using this with gear such as the Shade-Slayer Cloak or the Knife of the Undermountain King, along with a Champion fighter&#39;s Improved Critical Hit ability, can have a character dealing out an incredible number of critical hits.





 7  Elixir Of See Invisibility 
Ingredients: Suspension Of Nothic Eye &amp; Any Vitriol
        

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has its fair share of enemies that can turn invisible, which can make fighting them especially tough. While there are spells and class features that allow invisible creatures to be seen, they are limited to one character, which can limit who can target them in a fight. The Elixir of See Invisibility is a handy option to keep on hand as it can be drunk by everyone in the party and will last until a long rest, letting the entire team target those sneakier bad guys.
Illusion and Divination wizards gain the ability to see invisible creatures as a class feature, and a character with Volo&#39;s Ersatz Eye will also gain the ability as a passive feature. 






 6  Potion Of Speed 
Ingredients: Ashes Of Hyena Ear &amp; Any Salt
        

The Potion of Speed is a fantastic alternative to using the haste spell for the simple reason that haste requires concentration, while the potion obviously does not. After drinking a Potion of Speed, the affected character will gain plus two to their AC and advantage on all Dexterity saving throws, an additional action each turn, and their movement speed will be doubled. These effects will last for three turns, after which the character will become lethargic and won&#39;t be able to move or take an action for one turn, so it is best to use Potions of Speed close to the end of a battle to give an extra boost.





 5  Elixir Of The Colossus 
Ingredients: Salts Of Chasm Creeper &amp; Any Suspension


 







The Elixir of the Colossus is a really fun potion to give to melee fighters in BG3, as it will make all their weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage and give them advantage on all Strength checks and saving throws. The really fun part, however, is that this elixir increases that character’s size and stacks with the enlarge spell to effectively make that BG3 character a giant. Besides looking hilarious, this will also increase the carry capacity of the enlarged character 25% for each boost, letting the party gather all the loot they want.





 4  Elixir Of Bloodlust 
Ingredients: Ashes Of Worg Fang &amp; Any Salt
        

Another elixir perfect for melee fighters is the Elixir of Bloodlust, which gives a brilliant buff. This elixir gives the drinker five temporary hit points and an extra action per turn if they kill an enemy. While this isn&#39;t incredibly useful later in BG3, in Act 1 and 2, the extra hit points can really come in handy, especially for less tanky DPS characters like Astarion, who is more likely to get kills with Sneak Attack.

 3  Potion Of Animal Speaking 
Ingredients: Essence Of Acorn Truffle &amp; Any Salt
        

It&#39;s no secret that one of the most essential spells to have prepared in BG3 is speak with animals. The ability to chat to every critter the party meets helps with quests, as well as being very cute. However, one of the drawbacks of using the spell is that it only affects the spellcaster, meaning they are the one who must speak with the animals. Using the potion bypasses this, as any character can drink the potion and gain the ability to chat happily with any animals until the next long rest.





 2  Remedial Potion 
Ingrediets: Salts of Xorn Scales &amp; Any Suspension
        

The Remedial Potion is an often overlooked, uncommon potion that can cure multiple status conditions in BG3. There are plenty of enemies throughout the game that can blind, paralyze, poison, or silence characters in battle, making some fights harder than they need to be. Keeping a few Remedial Potions on hand at all times can easily deal with that, as it can cure all the previously mentioned conditions.
Remedial Potions can be drunk by a single character to cure themselves, but if multiple companions are affected by a condition, throwing a potion will cure them all if they are close together. 






 1  Potion Of Healing 
Ingredients: Salts Of Rogue&#39;s Morsel &amp; Any Suspension (Standard Version)
        

It might sound obvious, but keeping stocked up with and using Healing Potions can mean the difference between life and death in Baldur’s Gate 3. Healing Potions come in four varieties and are found throughout the game, but are also craftable. As the party levels up and gains more hit points, they should use the next level of Healing Potions. Healing Potions are fantastically useful in BG3 as they can be drunk as a bonus action, can be thrown to heal multiple companions at once and are a great back up in case the healer goes down or runs out of spell slots.
