# Baldurs Gate 3 Players Are Still Missing Out On A Key Area


## SUMMARY 



  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers choices that impact the narrative, but some players are missing out on a crucial area that affects a key companion&#39;s personal quest.   Both the Underdark and the Mountain Pass can be visited in the game, but many players are unaware of this and are choosing one over the other based on gameplay difficulty instead of narrative reasons.   The Mountain Pass is crucial for Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest, as it is the home of the githyanki crèche where she believes she can find a cure for the mind flayer parasite.

## Literature Review

At the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s first act, the party is told to choose between the Mountain Pass or the Underdark, but they can actually visit both.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a game built on choices, some simple and some more complicated, but all impacting the narrative to at least some degree. However, one such choice early on is tripping some players up, and the result is a crucial area being completely missed. Given that this area is important to a key companion&#39;s personal quest, missing out on it can have repercussions further down the line in BG3.

Initially releasing in August 2023, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has been a runaway success thanks to the freedom it offers when solving problems and the respect the game shows for player agency. Pulling in eight nominations for The Game Awards 2023, BG3 demonstrates how to properly use a game&#39;s time in early access to polish the end result based on feedback. However, it could be that BG3&#39;s early access is partially to blame for this current problem.

                  Baldur’s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It)   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.   


 Both The Underdark &amp; The Mountain Pass Can Be Visited 
          




Towards the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s first act, the party are offered a choice of how to proceed, travel through the Underdark or through the Mountain Pass to reach the Shadow-Cursed Lands. However, what many are still unaware of is that both areas can be visited, rather than choosing one over the other. This has led to a large chunk of Lae&#39;zel&#39;s personal quest being skipped by some, or context for Shadowheart&#39;s journey for others.



 Why Many BG3 Players End Up Skipping The Mountain Pass 
         

After siding with either the tiefling refugees and the druids or the goblins and the forces of the Absolute, the adventuring party is faced with a choice. Speaking with either Minthara or Halsin, they will learn there are two routes to their next destination of Moonrise Towers: the Mountain Pass or the Underdark. The implication with the discussion is that one must be chosen over the other; however, many may be shocked to learn even after several BG3 playthroughs that both areas can be visited.




The reason behind this confusion is perhaps for three reasons, the first and most obviously being that the game dialogue insinuates that one has to be chosen over the other. Here it is suggested that the Mountain Pass is extremely dangerous and the Underdark is the safer route to the Shadow-Cursed Lands. This implies to the player that the choice is based on gameplay difficulty rather than narrative reasons, prompting many to choose one or the other based on how capable they feel their characters are.

The second and third reasons link to in-game prompts and early access. During early access, only Baldur’s Gate 3’s Act One was accessible, with countless parties exploring the areas around the Druid Grove, the Blighted Village, and the Goblin Camp until they knew them like the back of their hand. While the main bulk of the map could be explored, a pop-up would appear explaining that the group could go no further in certain places and that these would be added in the final release.




One such place was on the road to the Mountain Pass, leading many to dive into the Underdark assuming that, just like the Underdark, the Mountain Pass led directly into Act Two. A pop-up still appears when first accessing the Mountain Pass even after release, warning the party to make sure they have no unfinished business in the Act One area. Again, this makes many assume that entering this new area will lock off parts of BG3&#39;s story for them, but this isn&#39;t the case.



It is advised that the quest line with the goblins and druids be resolved before venturing into the Mountain Pass for the first time. Failing to do so will result in the druids completing the Rite of Thorns and locking off the Grove or kicking the tieflings out prematurely otherwise.




The Mountain Pass area is filled with githyanki and is the location for the crèche Lae&#39;zel is so desperate to find. The pop-up serves as a warning that this new location should not be entered by a low level party; however, it can be visited then exited, allowing the party to travel to Moonrise Towers via the Underdark. The Mountain Pass may still seem superfluous, though, since the Underdark is filled with quests and plot-relevant encounters.






 The Mountain Pass Is Crucial For Lae’zel’s Personal Quest 
         

The answer to why the Mountain Pass should be visited can be summed up in one word, or rather name: Lae’zel. The Mountain Pass is the home to the Rosymorn Monastery, a former temple to Lathander which has been taken over by a githyanki crèche. It is here Lae&#39;zel believes she will find a cure for the mind flayer parasite, and it is here that her personal questline begins.

Visiting the crèche will result in a confrontation with certain members of this githyanki group, culminating in a conversation with Vlaakith herself. This BG3 questline gives much needed context to the strange artifact the party is carrying, as well as changing Lae&#39;zel&#39;s views towards Vlaakith. The information gathered in the Mountain Pass is vital to fully understanding the significance of whom the Emperor has with them in the Astral Prism, as well as Raphael&#39;s offer later in Act Three.




                  Devora Wilde Wants Players To &#34;Give Lae&#39;zel A Chance&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Devora Wilde discusses playing githyanki companion Lae&#39;zel, the complexity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s narrative and githyanki culture clashes.    

The quests in this area all focus on Lae’zel and the githyanki and are a must for anyone invested in the proud warrior as a character. There is a lot of approval to be earned from Lae’zel in this area alone, along with insight into the githyanki as a people. This is on top of some fantastic gear which can be found as well as purchased during the course of the short githyanki crèche quest line here.

From the Mountain Pass, the party can continue on into the Shadow-Cursed Lands or return to the BG3 Act One area to journey through the Underdark. The Mountain Pass zone even has a pathway leading directly back to the Goblin Camp to make it easy for the party to move on to the Underdark after completing this area. While this area can be visited at any time during Act One, it is better to leave it until the end as the enemies here are quite tough.




For an area which has such significance to Lae’zel and an immense amount of lore to be discovered, it seems strange that developers Larian Studios would place such an oddly worded warning on the area. The result has been many playthroughs losing out on massive amounts of Lae’zel approval, and in some cases, losing her as a companion due to this. Perhaps this will be addressed in a later patch for Baldur’s Gate 3, but for now, all that can be done is to hope that exploration and experimentation will have more players discovering this vital area.
