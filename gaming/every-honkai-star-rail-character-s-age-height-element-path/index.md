## Literature Review

Honkai: Star Rail features plenty of characters. While element and path are important for combat, heights and ages can be fun details to know.




Honkai: Star Rail features dozens of characters that are currently playable, each with a unique personality and strengths, and there are more characters officially set to be added moving forward, continuously expanding the list. Unlike Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail doesn&#39;t give exact information about its characters like height and birthday, but it&#39;s possible to estimate height and age, at least. As such, this listing is formed of guesses for height and age, but the elements and paths will be accurate to information given in-game.
Filling the role of the Trailblazer in Honkai: Star Rail, players join the Astral Express on a fantasy space adventure from HoYoverse. Many companions that players encounter can be earned and added to their list of playable characters and teammates. Since enemy weaknesses vary, it&#39;s a good idea to have a variety of characters with different elements in order to be prepared to fight any enemy combinations that appear.

 41  Argenti 
Path: Erudition


 







Argenti is a character that follows the Path of the Beauty but, considering that does not exist in the gameplay mechanics, he embraces the Path of the Erudition. Argenti is a Physical DPS character in Honkai: Star Rail.
Argenti is fairly tall and should be at least around 6&#39;1&#34;, though he may be slightly taller. He is a human, so his physical appearance sets him at around 30 and 35 years old.





 40  Arlan 
Path: Destruction
        

Arlan is a Lightning element Honkai: Star Rail character on the Destruction path. His age is likely in the late teens to early twenties. Thanks to some data compilation made based on official ads, posted by PromiseMeStars on Reddit, it is possible to determine that Arlan stands at roughly 5&#39;1&#34; tall.
While he can become an Astral Express visitor, he&#39;s otherwise found at Herta&#39;s Space Station.Arlan is the chief of security at the Space Station, which makes him a valuable asset to Herta and Asta. He has a pet dog called Peppy, which can be found roaming around the Space Station and can occasionally help in quests.





 39  Asta 
Path: Harmony
        

Another Honkai: Star Rail character found on Herta&#39;s Space Station, Asta is a Fire character on the Harmony path. Like Arlan, she&#39;s also in her early twenties, but probably no older than 23. As for height, she stands at an estimated 5&#39;5&#34; tall.
Asta is shown to be a caring character, and she has a lot of responsibilities on the Herta Space Station. However, she still keeps track of her colleagues and shows concern for Arlan during Companion Missions. This leads to the player being able to spend time with Arlan&#39;s dog, Peppy, in one of the best side quests in Honkai: Star Rail.





 38  Bailu 
Path: Abundance
        

Bailu is one of the few Honkai: Star Rail characters on the Path of the Abundance, making her a healer. When it comes to damage, her element is Lightning. Although her height of 3&#39;9&#34; and her usual demeanor make her seem younger, Bailu is in her late teens to early twenties, but likely not older than 21.
This is because Bailu is a Vidyadhara, a long-life species that tends to age more slowly when compared to regular humans. She is expected to live on to her hundreds, much like the other draconic denizens of the Xianzhou Luofu.





 37  Blade 
Path: Destruction
        

A former member of the High-Cloud Quintet in Honkai: Star Rail, Blade was previously known as Yingxing. He was a short-life species, but after a forbidden ritual made by Dan Feng, he was cursed with immortality due to his Mara affliction.

Blade is one of the best characters in Honkai: Star Rail, but players will need to farm. Here are all the materials required for Bladeâ€™s ascension.

 36  Bronya 
Path: Harmony
        

Commander of the Silvermane Guard, Bronya is a Wind element character on the Path of the Harmony. She&#39;s likely between the ages of 23 and 25, and she stands at roughly 5&#39;6&#34; tall. The Delicate Snow Globe in Honkai: Star Rail reveals more about her past for curious players.
Bronya is one of the most important characters in Belobog. She is the key to ending the segregation that takes place on the last remaining city of Jarilo-VI and is great friends with Seele.





 35  Clara 
Path: Destruction
        

Among the younger Honkai: Star Rail characters, Clara is around 10 to 12 years old. For height, she stands at around 4&#39;7&#34; tall. Clara uses the Physical element and is on the Destruction path.
Clara is always accompanied by Svarog, a humanoid robot that leads all other robots in Belobog. His programming is to protect human life and, thus, protect Clara, the symbol of human purity.





 34  Dan Heng 
Path: Hunt
        

Dan Heng is one of the first Honkai: Star Rail characters to join the player&#39;s team. He uses the Wind element and is on the Hunt path. He&#39;s also in his mid-twenties at around 23 to 25 years old, and he stands 5&#39;7&#34; tall.
Dan Heng is the reincarnated form of Dan Feng, a Vidyadhara who used to be the High Elder of the Xianzhou Luofu. He, however, committed a heinous crime and was submitted to the rebirth process, being reborn into two split people: Dan Heng and Bailu.





 33  Dan Heng - Imbibitor Lunae 
Path: Destruction


 







Dan Heng - Imbibitor Lunae is the awakened form of Dan Heng. In this special state in Honkai: Star Rail, Imbibitor Lunae draws on the power of the High Elder of the Xianzhou Luofu and uses draconic energy in battle, taking on the Path of the Destruction and embracing Imaginary as his element in battle.
Imbibitor Lunae keeps the same body as Dan Heng, but his newly exposed Vidyadhara horns should give him some extra height, boosting him to around 5&#39;9&#34; or 6&#39;0&#34;.





 32  Dr. Ratio 
Path: Hunt
        

Dr. Ratio in Honkai: Star Rail is a character that follows the Path of the Hunt, which makes them a DPS unit. He uses Imaginary DMG in battle. He is a fairly enigmatic figure, so little is actually known about him so far.
However, based on his appearance, he should be around 35 years old. Dr. Ratio is a tall character and should match Blade&#39;s height, at around 6&#39;2&#34;.





 31  Fu Xuan 
Path: Preservation


 







The Master Diviner of the Xianzhou Luofu is an important figure aboard the flagship and is responsible for determining the path of the vessel among the stars. Fu Xuan follows the Path of the Preservation and uses Quantum in combat.
With her hair bows, he is estimated to be around 4&#39;9&#34;. Fu Xuan is a Xianzhou Native, which makes her a long-life species. Though her physical appearance makes her seem like she is in her early twenties, she may be much older. Looking to substitute Jing Yuan as the general of the Luofu, she may as well be in her hundreds.





 30  Gepard 
Path: Preservation
        

Another Honkai: Star Rail character from Jarilo-VI, Gepard is on the Preservation path and uses the Ice element. He&#39;s likely between the ages of 25 and 27. One of the taller characters, he&#39;s roughly 6&#39;3&#34;.
Gepard is the brother of Serval and Lynx and is part of the Landau family. Though he often operates against the will of the Trailblazer, he is their ally as he also wants the best for Belobog.





 29  Guinaifen 
Path: Nihility
        

Guinaifen is not a native to the Xianzhou Luofu but has settled down on the flagship. This character follows the Path of the Nihility and uses Fire in combat.
She is a good friend of Sushang and is a streamer. Guinaifen is fairly young, probably in her early twenties, at around 21 or 22. She is around the same height as her best friend, standing at 5&#39;6&#34;.





 28  Hanya 
Path: Harmony


 







Hanya is a support unit in Honkai: Star Rail, as she follows the Path of the Harmony. She uses Physical DMG when battling. One of the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission, Hanya stands at around 5&#39;6&#34;.
Her exact age is unknown, but she looks to be in her late twenties or early thirties. Nevertheless, Hanya is a Xianzhou Native, which could mean she is a lot older than she appears to be.





 27  Herta 
Path: Erudition
        

Herta&#39;s age is likely the most difficult to estimate in Honkai: Star Rail because she only appears in the form of a puppet that resembles her younger self. However, she has been around for a long time, as she was one of the minds responsible for the construction of the Herta Space Station itself.
Her puppet is roughly 5&#39;2&#34; tall, but it&#39;s impossible to know if the real Herta is taller than that. As a puppet, she uses the Ice element and is on the Erudition path.





 26  Himeko 
Path: Erudition
        

A member of the Astral Express in Honkai: Star Rail, Himeko is a Fire element character on the Erudition path. She&#39;s in her early to mid-thirties, probably between 32 and 35. She stands at 5&#39;7&#34; tall.
Along with Welt, Himeko is one of the leaders of the Astral Express, while also serving as a mentor of sorts for the younger members, like March 7th, Dan Heng, and even the Trailblazer themselves.





 25  Hook 
Path: Destruction
        

Part of Honkai: Star Rail&#39;s Adventurous Moles, Hook is on the Destruction path and uses the Fire element. She&#39;s around Clara&#39;s age, likely between 10 and 12 years old. However, she&#39;s a bit shorter and likely isn&#39;t taller than 3&#39;9&#34;.
Hook gets a bit taller when considering her hat, however. Like all other Moles, she lives in the Underworld portion of Belobog.





 24  Huohuo 
Path: Abundance


 







Huohuo is a young Foxian girl who has been cursed by a heliobus called Tail. This is fitting since they were sealed inside Huohuo&#39;s tail. Despite looking very young, at around 10 years old, Huohuo may be a bit older. She is of a long-life species, which means she can be a few dozen years old.
Huohuo is very short and stands at around 5&#39;1&#34;. She follows the Path of the Abundance, which makes her a healer. Huohuo is, however, also capable of providing bonuses to the team. She uses Wind as her element in battle.





 23  Jingliu 
Path: Destruction


 







One of the former members of the High-Cloud Quintet, Jingliu was also once Jing Yuan&#39;s master in Honkai: Star Rail. This character is at least a few hundred years old, as she is not only part of an ancient group but also a Xianzhou Native.
            
 
 Honkai: Star Rail - Jingliu Character Builds (Light Cones, Relics, Team Comps) 
To adequately use Jingliu as a main DPS in Honkai: Star Rail, you need to build her correctly and pair her up with the best team comps.



She has been afflicted by Mara, which not only makes her somewhat immortal but also affects her sanity. Jingliu uses Ice in combat and follows the Path of the Destruction. She is approximately 5&#39;7&#34;, as she is roughly around Himeko&#39;s height.





 22  Jing Yuan 
Path: Erudition
        

Jing Yuan is one of the strongest DPS characters in Honkai: Star Rail for widespread damage rather than individual targeting. He&#39;s on the Erudition path and uses the Lightning element. For height, he stands at 6&#39;3&#34;.
As a long-life species, Jing Yuan looks like he is between the ages of 38 and 40. However, he has been operating as the general of the Xianzhou Luofu for hundreds of years. It is unknown exactly how old Jing Yuan is, but he has been around for centuries if not millennia.
