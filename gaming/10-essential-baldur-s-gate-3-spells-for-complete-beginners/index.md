## Literature Review

There are some amazing low level spells that those new to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 should keep an eye out for when picking their classes and spells.





The spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are lifted directly from DnD, with many of the effects remaining the same. There is a fantastic array of low-level spells and cantrips in BG3 that offer great utility and damage to help get the party through Act 1. With combat and skill checks to navigate while learning the game, these cantrips and level-one spells should make the early days of playing BG3 a little easier.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Thunderwave (Level One Evocation) 
Bards, Druids, Sorcerers, Wizards, Tempest Clerics, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights


 







Thunderwave is an underrated spell in BG3 which can help when spellcasters are surrounded by enemies. The spell creates a wave that deals 2d8 thunder damage and forces all targets in a five-meter cube to make a Constitution saving throw to be pushed away from the caster, while targets that succeed in the save take half damage and are not pushed. Thunderwave is a really fun spell to fling enemies away when surrounded, make them fall to their doom off of high areas, or force enemy spellcasters to make concentration checks.
Be careful with Thunderwave as it does not discriminate between enemy or ally targets, so positioning it correctly is important. 






 9  Shield (Level One Abjuration) 
Sorcerers, Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights
        

Shield is a brilliant spell that triggers as reaction when the spellcaster comes under attack. When a character is targeted by a melee, ranged, or spell attack shield will increase their AC by five and absorb the damage. The shield will then remain in place until the start of that character&#39;s next turn and will even block magic missile that does not need an attack roll.
Shield is great at low levels and can make the difference between life and death for squishier party members. 






 8  Bone Chill (Necromancy Cantrip) 
Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards, Spore Druids, Eldritch Knights, Arcane Tricksters, Lore Bards
        

Bone chill is a great cantrip as it has three effects that are useful right through to the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Firstly, Bone Chill deals 1d8 necrotic damage that will scale up as the character increases in level to 3d8 at level 10. The next effect is unique to undead targets, as they will have disadvantage on attack rolls while affected by bone chill.
Then finally, the best feature of this humble cantrip is that targets affected cannot remain any hit points until the start of the casters next turn, which can really come in handy in fights with enemy healers.





 7  Sanctuary (Level One Abjuration) 
Clerics, Oath of Devotion Paladins, Lore Bards
        

Sanctuary is a spell that has really come into its own in BG3 after being overlooked in DnD for so long. With sanctuary, the caster can keep themselves or an ally safe from enemy attacks by preventing them from being targeted. Sanctuary lasts for 10 turns and is concentration, but is perfect for keeping party members on low health safe while they heal or reposition.
Although characters affected by Sanctuary can&#39;t be directly targeted they can still take AOE damage. 






 6  Grease (Level One Conjuration) 
Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights


 







Grease is a weird BG3 spell, as at first glance it doesn’t appear to be that useful; however, it is one of the most versatile low level spells in the game. Grease can be used to create a puddle of grease on the ground which will act as difficult terrain for those who pass through it, making them move at half speed with the possibility for them to fall prone.
But, even better, grease can also be ignited with a fireball, candle, or other source of fire to create a fiery patch that will deal damage to those forced to pass through it.





 5  Create Or Destroy Water (Level One Transmutation) 
Clerics, Druids, Conjuration Wizards, Storm Sorcerers
        

Create or destroy water is a spell that does exactly as it describes: creating (or destroying) a pool of water. This a great for putting out fires or washing away acidic pools that might damage the party. The spell also interacts nicely with cold and lightning spells as the water adds the wet condition to creatures meaning they will take extra damage from those damage types. At the same time, the destroy element of the spell can be used to prevent enemies from pulling the same trick on the party.





 4  Eldritch Blast (Evocation Cantrip) 
Warlocks, Lore Bards
        

Eldritch Blast is easily one of the best cantrips in BG3 for its offensive capabilities that increase as the character levels up and can be augmented with Eldritch Invocations if playing as a warlock. Dealing 1d10 force damage, Eldritch Blast is more capable of taking down enemies throughout Act 1 and more damage can be dealt when paired with hex.
As a cantrip, Eldritch Blast will always be available to the spellcaster without the need to worry about spell slots. 






 3  Speak With Animals (Level One Divination) 
Bards, Druids, Nature Clerics, Rangers, Oath of Ancients Paladins, Wildheart Barbarians


 







For a spell that will open up new interactions and even questlines then it&#39;s hard to go wrong with Speak With Animals. This brilliant spell allows the caster to chat with any critter they come across in BG3, leading to moments that range from hilarious to heartfelt. Speak with animals can be cast using a spell slot in combat or as a ritual otherwise, allowing one party member to converse with Faerûn&#39;s animals until their next long rest.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3: Missing Letters Locations (Act 3 Quest) 
&#34;Find the Missing Letters&#34; is an Act 3 quest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. It&#39;s a simple quest, but actually finding the lost messages can prove difficult.








 2  Magic Missile (Level One Evocation) 
Sorcerers, Wizards, Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights, Lore Bards
        

Magic Missile is a brilliant early-game spell that becomes more and more useful throughout BG3. The spell sends out magical darts that each deal 1d4&#43;1 damage, with three darts at level one and that number increases when magic missile is cast at higher levels.
What makes magic missile so useful though is that it is a guaranteed hit, as there is no attack roll, making it perfect for burning through enemy shields or taking down a target quickly.





 1  Guidance (Divination Cantrip) 
Clerics, Druids, Pact of the Tome Warlocks


 







Finally, for a spell that will continue to be incredibly useful at every stage of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 then look no further than guidance. This simple utility cantrip is used out of combat when rolling skill checks such as lockpicking, persuasion, or arcana.
Guidance can be selected from the dice screen and will add 1d4 to the ability check, which might not sound a lot but can often make all the difference. As a cantrip there are no limits to how many times guidance can be used, making it easily one of the best must-have spells to choose when starting out.
