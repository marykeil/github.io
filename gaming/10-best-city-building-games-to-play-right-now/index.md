## Literature Review

The amount of strategy and creativity that comes in city-building video games gives players a truly engaging experience, as well as fun!




The city-building PC video game genre offers a depth of experience that includes a lot of forethought and strategy, as well as creativity. It is sometimes mixed with the general survival theme, as players take on the role of a great leader and are responsible for the welfare of their citizens. The imaginative processes that some can incorporate into laying out their cities can make for beautiful displays of creativity and give a very satisfying boost.
Over the years, many different takes on the city-building theme have been created. Whether leaning more into the survival aspects or making them more relaxing by focusing on a casual puzzle feel, players can pick and choose what type of experience they wish to have. Of course, the traditional Sim City type of experience is still one to be revered, and has been carried forward to today&#39;s technologies with Cities: Skylines and Cities: Skylines 2. Whichever format someone is looking for, here are a few of the best city-builders available today.
