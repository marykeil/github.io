## Literature Review

There have been multiple leaks and rumors about a new Mythical Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC called Dokutaro, which allegedly resembles a peach.




The alleged release of Dokutaro in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet seems imminent, as the second part of the expansion pack named The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero is due to arrive in mid-December. The second DLC will continue the narrative that was started with The Teal Mask DLC earlier this year. Instead of going on another field trip to Kitakami, however, players will be sent on an exchange program with Blueberry Academy in Unova, a sister school of Naranja and Uva Academies in Paldea, respectively. There, they will study and dedicate their efforts toward competitive battling.




In fact, Blueberry Academy has its own Elite Four League, composed of the four top Trainers enrolled in the institution. There are clues in Pokémon’s Indigo Disk DLC that point to the next game in the franchise, including the identity of the BB Elite Four members. While these Trainers may be put under the spotlight, there will be another narrative component developing, which involves Kieran in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The NPC who was originally introduced with Teal Mask will make a reappearance that may not only be important but also connected to a completely new Mythical Pokémon that has been mentioned abundantly in leaks.

 Who Is Dokutaro In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
          

Present in various Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC leaks, Dokutaro is said to be a peach-shaped Mythical Pokémon that will make its debut in the upcoming expansion. YouTuber HDvee mentions the creature on multiple occasions, and there are reasons to believe that Dokutaro is actually the leader of the Loyal Three Legendary trio introduced with the Teal Mask expansion. While Dokutaro’s peach-like visage may differ from those of the animal-based Loyal Three, there are strong pieces of evidence that connect them to one another, and having it as their leader makes perfect sense if taking into consideration the source of inspiration behind all these creatures’ designs.






If the Mythical Pokémon leak is, in fact true, there is still a chance that Dokutaro may not be the monster’s name, or at least not its English name – Dokutaro could be a play on the 毒 Doku (poison) and Momotaro, a Japanese folk tale that seems to have some connection to the Pokémon’s reported existence.






 Dokutaro’s Connection To Pokémon Teal Mask 
         

The first connection that Pokémon Indigo Disk’s Dokutaro has to the Teal Mask expansion is that it is, allegedly, the leader of the Loyal Three. Not only is it rumored that Dokutaro is the head of the Legendary trio, but is also responsible for resurrecting them during the events of the DLC. As was seen in-game, the three creatures were actually dead and buried in a shrine overlooking Mossui Town. However, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti are resurrected shortly after Kieran loses a battle and frustratingly punches the shrine. Although it seems like Kieran awakened them, there may be more hidden details behind this.




It is largely rumored that Dokutaro is the one who mysteriously resurrected the Loyal Three. It is also said that Dokutaro is a Poison-type Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC and this, allegedly, is also the reason why the Legendary trio members share Poison- as their first Type. The fact that leaks indicate that Dokutaro resembles a peach is also very important. The designs of the Loyal Three are based around the three different animals that befriend the young boy in the Japanese folk tale known as Momotaro. This tale is also called “Peach Boy”, and it follows the story of a boy who was born from a giant peach.



Dokutaro may have been the one responsible for the Toxic Chain granted to each of the Loyal Three members.




Having the peach-like Dokutaro at the center of this group makes perfect sense, as the peach-born Momotaro is the protagonist and the animals are deuteragonists. However, the whole story in the Teal Mask subverts the tale’s idea of the oni, namely Ogerpon in the game, being the villain. As such, having the Loyal Three and Dokutaro as something close to antagonistic figures while making Ogerpon an ally also makes sense for the game.




The leaker known as Riddler Khu on X was also featured in HDvee’s video, as they made a suggestive post on the platform that, despite Kieran’s construction in the Teal Mask DLC, he may not be the actual rival or antagonistic force in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. HDvee speculates that Kieran may be under Dokutaro’s control. This theory would explain why Kieran’s behavior changed so much after he found out about the main character befriending Ogerpon – and how his punch on the Loyal Three shrine may have awakened the Legendaries.



 Why Dokutaro May Only Appear In Pokémon Indigo Disk 
          

The main question that arises from Dokutaro’s leaks in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is why it is only appearing in the second expansion rather than in The Teal Mask, where it would be directly connected to the Loyal Three. That explanation may lie within the theory that Kieran is under the control of Dokutaro. As such, it is possible that, during their adventures through Blueberry Academy, they may discover that their former friend and newfound rival is behaving poorly because of the Mythical Pokémon’s toxic influence. This would be the main way of connecting the events of the Teal Mask to the Indigo Disk DLC.




According to the same leaks shared by HDvee, it is possible that Dokutaro will have a secondary form called a Battle State. This Battle State will be a new feature introduced with the release of the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC and will also be given to Koraidon, Miraidon, and Terapagos. While it is uncertain exactly what the Battle State entails, it is possible that Dokutaro’s release has been pushed into The Indigo Disk for narrative purposes involving Kieran and this allegedly new gameplay mechanic.

Of course, leaks and speculation should always be met with a grain of salt. Nintendo is being quite secretive when it comes to the contents of The Indigo Disk, especially in comparison to The Teal Mask, so there may be many ground-breaking secrets hidden in its campaign. Regardless, it should not take too long before players find out the truth, as the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrives for Nintendo Switch on December 14.
