# This Highly-Requested GTA 6 Feature May Not Be Possible To Pull Off (Yet)


## SUMMARY 



  Grand Theft Auto 6 will probably not have an advanced weather system, which may disappoint players who were expecting immersive weather effects.   The decision to abandon advanced weather plans might be due to technical limitations, as creating realistic extreme weather conditions would require significant processing power.   While it doesn&#39;t look like GTA 6 will have groundbreaking weather, it is likely to build upon the weather improvements seen in GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, including the use of ray-tracing technology for enhanced lighting effects.

## Literature Review

Grand Theft Auto 6 should overhaul the franchise in many ways, but one area is unlikely to make the most exciting changes that it could.




Grand Theft Auto 6 is sure to bring a variety of new features to the series, but one major addition might not be able to make the cut just yet. With over a decade passing since the original release of Grand Theft Auto 5, expectations for the new title are sky-high, and the intervening years have seen plenty of hardware development to support more advanced options than ever before. There&#39;s always room for more advancement, however, and it seems like some things fans wanted for GTA 6 may not come around until the inevitable Grand Theft Auto 7.




Rockstar is no stranger to getting the best out of consoles, and the company&#39;s last generation of releases showcased its interest in squeezing out as many impressive elements as possible. Although Grand Theft Auto skipped the generation in terms of new releases, the PS4 and Xbox One ports of GTA 5 made a host of graphical improvements that made them look quite a bit better than their PS3 and Xbox 360 counterparts. Red Dead Redemption 2 highlighted Rockstar&#39;s full technical prowess, with gorgeous vistas and intricate details that still impress today.

 Advanced Weather Might Not Be Possible In GTA 6 
          

A next-level weather system could be a big boost to immersion in GTA 6, but it&#39;s looking unlikely that the newest title in Rockstar&#39;s crime saga will make some desired advancements in this regard. As reported by ComicBook, &#34;extreme weather&#34; that was planned for the game has been taken off the table, meaning the expected setting of Vice City will stick to more routine environmental conditions. This shouldn&#39;t particularly get in the way of the experience, as extreme weather isn&#39;t a standard feature in the vast majority of games, but it could be disappointing to anyone who would prefer to see big shake-ups throughout the course of gameplay.






At the time of this writing, the reportedly cut weather mechanics have not officially been confirmed by Rockstar Games.




The presumably leaked information doesn&#39;t clarify what prompted the abandonment of more advanced weather plans, mentioning &#34;tech limitations&#34; as a potential reason but leaving the question open-ended. Although it might seem like current hardware would be capable of swinging intense inclement weather, the idea that it simply couldn&#39;t be managed on a technical level is a perfectly reasonable explanation. Trying to build a system that could throw billions of gallons of water around in a hurricane or swirl up a tornado is a daunting task, and the huge processing power that it would require would be complicated by attempts to make it interact with structures in a meaningful way.

 Other Games Have Managed Extreme Weather Before 
How Just Cause 4 Pulled Off Its Extreme Weather
          

It&#39;s not entirely impossible to make extreme weather conditions work within a game engine, it&#39;s just a challenge that can be particularly complicated to solve. One similar game to Grand Theft Auto that put a big focus on inclement weather was Just Cause 4, which took the franchise&#39;s typical propensity for mayhem and threw some major storms into the mix. Lightning storms, tornadoes, blizzards, and sandstorms can all make flying around in a wingsuit more challenging, and the striking nature of these forces was a major point of marketing for the title.

Jacques Kerner, a senior software engineer at Just Cause 4 developer Avalanche Studios, went into depth on simulating weather conditions and aerodynamics in a blog post on Game Developer. Ultimately, the team had to juggle wind patterns and aerodynamic drag models for every dynamic object while maintaining a reasonable development scope and optimization standard, a complex task that required significant simplification of the concepts to make things work. In GTA 6, pulling this off would be even more difficult, as the games&#39; settings feature a much more consistent level of high density than the less urban focus of the Just Cause series.

 GTA 6&#39;s Weather Will Still Be Better Than GTA 5&#39;s 
         

GTA 6 might not be taking the steps forward with weather that would make it truly stand out, but that doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be any progress in the category. Grand Theft Auto has typically worked on a fairly basic cycle system of increasingly impressive weather scenarios, with GTA 5 eventually delivering some beautiful effects for fog and rain. RDR2 featured more impressive weather systems than any Grand Theft Auto title has, with a variety of different areas featuring unique weather phenomena appropriate to their environment.

There&#39;s no reason to expect that Rockstar wouldn&#39;t implement some of the improvements made in Red Dead Redemption 2 and possibly expand on them, even if Vice City isn&#39;t particularly likely to see the dust storms that can be found in some desert regions of RDR2. The abandonment of a sophisticated inclement weather system also doesn&#39;t mean that there can&#39;t be any new storms or even story moments focusing on showstopper catastrophes, just that the level of reactivity in Just Cause 4 is presumably off the table. It may stick to a basic cycle like prior games, however, which could be underwhelming even with added possibilities.

 What Grand Theft Auto 6 Weather Might Look Like 
          

Grand Theft Auto 5 didn&#39;t stop its graphical improvements with the last-generation bump, which also provides something of a sneak peek at where GTA 6 is likely to take things in the visual department. Although some of the changes on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S are comparatively minor, the addition of ray-tracing made a big difference in lighting realism. It would be surprising if GTA 6 doesn&#39;t make the most of ray-tracing technology, which could allow the game to render more accurate beams of sunlight and reflective puddles of rainwater.

It&#39;s hard not to be at least a little disappointed by the scrapped weather plans for GTA 6, as bringing in a wider variety of effects would have helped to make it feel real and believable. All the same, there&#39;s no reason to currently suspect that the game will be notably lacking in that regard, and it&#39;s possible that successfully pulling off major instances of inclement weather would have taken too much of a development focus away from other aspects. It seems like Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch without a game-changing weather system when it eventually arrives, but it&#39;s ultimately not all that much of a surprise.
