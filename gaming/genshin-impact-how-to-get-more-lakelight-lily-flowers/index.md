## Literature Review

Optimize your acquisition of Lakelight Lily in Genshin Impact by following this farming route and a few other tips that may increase your gains.





These Local Specialty items only spawn in very specific areas of Fontaine (so far), so you will need to head to a specific island rather than run or swim across the region randomly in search of them. It is possible that more of these will be added as the game progresses through regular updates and the region of Fontaine expands. These Lakelight Lily flowers are directly related to Version 4.2’s addition in Genshin Impact, which means they are not found near the Court of Fontaine, Poisson, or Beryl. Instead, you must dedicate your farming efforts to the northeast region.




                  Genshin Impact: Furina Character Builds (Weapons, Artifacts, Team Comps)   Building Furina can be tough, especially because she can play three different roles in a party. Here are her best builds and teams in Genshin Impact.    


 Best Lakelight Lily Farming Route In Genshin Impact (Spawn Points) 
          

The only locations that feature Lakelight Lily are northeast of the Fountain of Lucine and the Opera Epiclese. While it is spread across several areas of the Erinnyes Forest map, introduced with the release of Genshin Impact 4.2 the two main spawning points for Lakelight Lily are at the Weeping Willow of the Lake and Loch Urania.

If you need a consistent amount to gather quickly, these are the best locations to visit. As seen in the official interactive map on HoYoLAB, the two main clusters form around these inland water bodies. You can check the image below for a more accurate understanding of the spawn points:




          

There are other smaller clusters of Lakelight Lily in the area. The Local Speciality normally forms around water bodies. As such, any small lakes or riversides in the area are prone to having at least a few Lakelight Lily flowers nearby. The exceptions are the northeasternmost lake, as well as the closest water body to the northeast of the Fountain of Lucine in Genshin Impact.

Curiously, these two small lakes do not feature any Lakelight Lilies to farm. As registered by Game8, there are a total of 77 Lakelight Lily flowers that can be found – seven of which are only unlocked after completing the Wild Fairy of Erinnyes questline.



The respawn time for Lakelight Lily is 48 hours in real time. Fast-forwarding the time in-game by 48 hours will not make the clusters available for farming.









 Tips To Get More Lakelight Lily In Genshin Impact 
          

There are, essentially, two ways of grabbing more Lakelight Lily beyond the 77 clusters that are available for farming in the Erinnyes Forest portion of the Fontaine map. The first one allows players to grab an additional 15 Lakelight Lily. In order to grab the extra count of Local Specialties used in Furina’s Ascension, you will first need to complete the Wild Fairy of Erinnyes quest in Genshin Impact. Once this is completed, you will unlock a vendor by the name of Pahsiv. They are a Melusine and can be found in the Loch Urania area of Erinnyes Forest. There, you can exchange 2 Tidalga for 1 Lakelight Lily.



For reference, Tidalga is a material that you can obtain underwater in Genshin Impact. It resembles a blue jellyfish, with a small pink-colored nub between its tentacles.







Up to a total of 15 Lakelight Lily can be obtained through this method, which means you will need to have at least 30 Tidalga to buy the entire stock from Pahsiv. Her inventory, unfortunately, does not refresh, meaning 15 is the limit of Lakelight Lily you can purchase from her at any given moment. The second alternative method of increasing your gains when farming Lakelight Lily is to visit other players’ worlds in Genshin Impact. If they have not collected the items there, then you may be able to find them in the same locations they would normally be on your own map.

Of course, there is a matter of cordiality involved when farming resources from other players&#39; worlds. In case you have a friend who has unlocked Fontaine and is not planning on Ascending or even obtaining Furina, for instance, you should schedule a farming period in their world. Gathering these resources will not make a difference to their gameplay experience, so it is the most recommended way of grabbing these. Alternatively, you may join a co-op session in Genshin Impact and, in the game’s chat function, ask if you are allowed to farm Lakelight Lily or if they plan on doing so. If granted permission, you can essentially double your profits.






In case you are struggling to locate all 77 spawn points of Lakelight Lily, you can equip Lyney. The premium 5-star character has a Talent that makes Local Specialties in Fontaine appear on the mini-map, which makes it much easier to farm.






 How To Use Lakelight Lily In Genshin Impact 
         

Lakelight Lily’s primary usage is for the Ascension of certain characters from Fontaine. So far, only Furina utilizes the Local Specialty, but there is a chance that upcoming heroes will utilize it as well. It is common for a Local Speciality to be part of one or two characters’ Ascensions. The need for an abundance of Lakelight Lily flowers stems from the sheer amount required during the Ascension process. To get Furina to level 90 in Genshin Impact – or at least through her level 80 Ascension threshold – you will need a total of 168 Lakelight Lily.




Because of the limited 48-hour respawn time, obtaining all these items in a single run or day can be impossible. Getting Furina may take a few days, mainly if you are not visiting other players’ worlds. If you have the chance of farming more through co-op, then you can guarantee you will get all the necessary items to fully Ascend her in a single day. Lakelight Lily is easy to farm in Genshin Impact, though you may need to go off your regular route if you want to quickly increase your farming potential.
