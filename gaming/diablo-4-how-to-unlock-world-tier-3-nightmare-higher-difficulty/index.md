## Literature Review

To play Diablo 4 on a higher difficulty, players must unlock World Tier 3: Nightmare to scale up the enemies, dungeons, and rewards within the game.





Before you can think about World Tier 3, you first have to beat Diablo 4&#39;s main story with at least one character on the difficulties offered when you first start the game. You have two options between World Tier 1 (Adventurer) and World Tier 2 (Veteran), which determine the obstacles you&#39;ll face. It is worth noting that both of these realms draw from the same loot pool, with Tier 2 only having slightly tougher enemies.




                  Every Major Change In Diablo 4 Season 2 from D4 Season 1   Season 2 of Diablo 4 brings more than just the Season of Blood, there are also numerous quality-of-life improvements happening for the entire game.   


 How To Unlock World Tier 3: Nightmare In Diablo 4 
          

You unlock World Tier 3: Nightmare in Diablo 4 by completing a Capstone dungeon your character can access at the Cathedral of Light in Kyovashad. Once you finish the final events of the game&#39;s story, a new Primary Quest shows up on your map, showing where the Capstone dungeon is. This mission is designed for veterans, with characters between levels 50-70 having the best chance to succeed. 



You can only access World Tier 3: Nightmare&#39;s Capstone Dungeon on World Tier 2 difficulty. It cannot be found if your character is exploring World Tier 1. 







Every Capstone dungeon in Diablo 4 reflects the recommended level, with the one for World Tier 3 hosting a ton of bosses and Elite enemies that are at least level 50. If you are traveling with a group, make sure to collect as many Legendary items and gear as possible to prepare for the dungeon. Equipping powerful Legendary Aspects based on your character&#39;s class may help you overcome this challenge. 



 What Changes In World Tier 3: Nightmare? 
          

You can interact with the Inarius statue in Kyovashad to change your World Tier at will. Shifting between Tiers will change enemies to levels 50-70, modifying their loot and the amount of XP you gain by killing them. Monsters in World Tier 3 give 100% more experience and 15% more Gold, allowing new characters you create to level up faster and have more money for different tasks around Sanctuary. 






The enemies you face in World Tier 3 have a unique buff that allows them to pierce through 20% of a character&#39;s resistances, making even basic foes far deadlier than before.




One of the biggest changes to World Tier 3 is the ability to obtain Unique and Sacred gear items that are a step above Legendary in Diablo 4. Champion enemies that now appear in this difficulty drop these items, allowing your character to reach a new level of obscene strength. Exclusive World Events called Helltides also begin to show up in this Tier, giving you more opportunities to get these crazy gear drops. 

You also have the ability to collect Nightmare Sigils in this Tier, which can transform basic dungeons into Nightmare Dungeons on your map. These upgraded dungeons are another place to earn rarer loot and increased XP for your character. Choosing to unlock World Tier 3: Nightmare in Diablo IV is a perfect chance to progress in the game until you decide to face the even greater challenges of World Tier 4.
