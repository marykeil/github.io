## Literature Review

To make sure your PC runs Modern Warfare 3 best, there are certain graphics and performance settings that shape the action into the best it can look.





The Graphics setting menu has three different sections tied to your PC&#39;s Display, Quality, and View options. These all are connected to different functions that will impact your overall performance based on the graphics card and other hardware used in your system. For example, selecting the &#34;Custom&#34; prompt for Quality Presets may affect how you see your MTZ-556 Rifle loadout in Modern Warfare 3 as the FPS values adjust to showcase the gun firing.






Many graphic settings are not only determined by your individual PC hardware, but also by personal preference. Feel free to make adjustments and experiment with what you think might be best for your system.
