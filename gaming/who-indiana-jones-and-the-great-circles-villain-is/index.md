## Literature Review

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle pits the archaeologist against a dastardly new villain, although the foe sticks to classic franchise elements.




The upcoming video game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle tosses the intrepid archaeologist into a deadly adventure once more, and that journey looks like it will face him up against foes who are as dastardly as ever. Starting with rival archaeologist RenÃ© Belloq and the army of Nazis on his side in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones villains tend to be memorable parts of stories that are full of set pieces and surprises galore. Indiana always triumphs, of course, but his enemies are often done in by their hubris as much as they are by his wits.




The new Indiana Jones game is being developed by MachineGames, known primarily for making the modern Wolfenstein games that tell an alternate history of Nazi rule. As such, it&#39;s no surprise that they&#39;re returning to the Indiana Jones basics of a Nazi threat, and it&#39;s likely that the game will incorporate some memorable deaths to send off its villains. Unlike the 1969 setting of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Great Circle is sticking to the original 1930s setting, sitting comfortably within the initial rise of the Third Reich before the outbreak of World War 2.


 Emmerich Voss Is The New Indiana Jones Villain 
          

The primary antagonist of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a German man named Emmerich Voss, who is clearly allied with the Nazi forces despite his own lack of a uniform. The Indiana Jones gameplay reveal trailer, available on the Xbox YouTube account, opens with Voss lying down on the desert floor to face a cornered Indiana, who balls up a fist before headbutting Voss in the face instead. Voss delivers a villainous speech, informing &#34;Dr. Jones&#34; that he was playing him all along and delivering the ominous message that the archaeologist will be left &#34;dead and forgotten in the sands of Africa.&#34;






 The Great Circle Has A Psychological Villain In Voss 
          

The Xbox Developer_Direct (similarly via the Xbox YouTube channel) also featured a more extended discussion of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with some of the development team, which does touch a little more on Emmerich Voss as the villain. Creative Director Axel Torvenius describes Voss as an &#34;intensely psychological man&#34; fixated on manipulating the human mind, giving him the intellectual edge that makes a great Indiana Jones villain more than just a thug. Whether his downfall in Bethesda&#39;s Indiana Jones game will come from underestimating Indiana, mystical forces, or a combination of both remains to be seen, but it will certainly come.


 




Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is shaping up to be an authentic Indiana Jones experience, and Emmerich Voss is definitely one of the most important parts of making that happen. Voss is being brought to life by voice actor Marios Gavrilis, who has plenty of experience in German dubs for video games, films, and television series. More details surrounding his motivations and personality will likely come to light before Indiana Jones and the Great Circle releases, but after several years with nothing to go on but a 30-second teaser, it&#39;s nice to simply know who the villain is.
