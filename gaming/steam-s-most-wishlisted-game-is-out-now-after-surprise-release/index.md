                  10 Things The Finals Does Better Than Other FPS Games   The Finals is a brand-new F2P first-person shooter holding its open beta and has a ton of things that other FPS games seem to seriously lack.   


 The Finals Is Now Free To Play 
Downloadable On Steam
         

Announced at The Game Awards 2023, The Finals is a live-service arena shooter where teams of three band together to take on other players in a virtual arena. Hyper-realized environments within a future dystopia setting and unique visuals and characters make The Finals an interesting and fresh take on the arena shooter and live-service model.




One of the best aspects of the game is that The Finals is free to play for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with full crossplay and cross-progression support. This, along with the title&#39;s small game size and remarkably low system requirements, make The Finals a game that many will be able to pick up without risk.



The Finals Beta was less than 25GB in total file size.

                  10 Best Gadgets To Get First in The Finals   While you may not think much of them at first, the best gadgets in The Finals have the potential to change the course of a game in your team&#39;s favor.    






 The Finals Added A New Las Vegas Map 
An Indoor Experience
          

The New Las Vegas map added to The Finals introduces the tight, claustrophobic corridors of Sin City to the game that wasn&#39;t available in either the closed or open beta periods. Unlike other maps like Seoul and Monaco, Las Vegas features mostly interior environments, with sprawling gambling spotted among tight staircases and hallways. This adds a new element to gameplay, as contestants are forced to fight inside the tight halls of the game.

                  The Finals: The Best Build For Beginners (Light, Medium, or Heavy)   If you&#39;re unsure about which Contestants to play in The Finals or how to play them, then rely on the best builds for each class to get you started.   



 Can The Finals Compete With Apex Legends And Fortnite? 
Only Time Will Tell
          




There&#39;s been a multitude of arena-based FPS titles with varying amounts of longevity that have been released over the past few years. Other than the Call of Duty franchise, only Fortnite, PUBG, and Apex Legends have arguably maintained a solid player base, something critical for a live-service game. As the title is a multiplayer PvP-based arena shooter, the success of the game will largely depend on the community and whether there&#39;s the drive for teams to come back and perfect their strategies.

While The Finals is a new and fresh take on the team-based arena shooter in many ways, others may view it as derivative of other titles like the aforementioned Fortnite and Apex Legends. Only time will tell whether the gaming community will fully embrace the fast-paced FPS, but initial impressions are good.
