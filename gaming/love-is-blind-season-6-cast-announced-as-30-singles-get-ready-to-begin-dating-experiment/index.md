Love Is Blind season 6 will introduce 30 brand-new singles who are going to be looking for love in the well-known experiment. Find out what to expect.




Love Is Blind season 6 is introducing a group of 30 new singles into the well-known experiment, giving them the chance to meet the love of their life in what could be the most unique experience of their life. Despite being called out on some legal issues, Love Is Blind is returning to Netflix for another season of the fascinating series that asks participants to get to know each other on an emotional level before incorporating physicality into the mix. With a group of 30 new singles entering the pod phase, Love Is Blind season 6 has the chance to bring together successful new couples.




Introducing a brand-new cast of singles, Love Is Blind shared a video that showed the singles answering some telling questions about what they&#39;re looking for in a relationship. &#34;I want someone who wants to connect on a more intimate level,&#34; new Love Is Blind contestant Chelsea shared, while fellow participant Johnny shared, &#34;There&#39;s no distractions, there&#39;s no other things to worry about,&#34; as one of the things he feels will be transformative about dating in the pods.


 

The singles also discussed their dealbreakers, with contestant Mackenzie explaining, &#34;It would be a dealbreaker if they didn&#39;t want to have children,&#34; while Laura shared, &#34;I know where I&#39;m going, I who I am, and I&#39;m not willing to compromise that for anybodyâ€“especially somebody I&#39;m dating.&#34; The new Love Is Blind season 6 cast shared about their personal lives and their hopes for the experiment, introducing themselves fully.





 What To Expect From Love Is Blind Season 6 
          

As the Love Is Blind season 6 cast is familiar with the experiment, it&#39;s possible that their results could be somewhat skewed, even with them looking for love in a controlled environment. The cast will work to make connections in the pods over a few weeks before couples who choose to get engaged will meet in person, hopeful their attraction can sustain itself. Most Love Is Blind contestants are looking for something bigger than the relationships they&#39;ve had in the past. &#34;I&#39;ve always wanted a family,&#34; Ariel, a mortgage broker, shared in the cast reveal video, &#34;and I think now is a kind of good time to start that process.&#34; 

Aside from the contestants already mentioned, the Love Is Blind season 6 cast includes Alejandra, Amber, Amber Desiree &#34;AD,&#34; Amy, Amy C., Ashley, Austin, Ben, Brittany, Clay, Danielle, Danette, Deion, Drake, Jamal, Jeramay, Jessica, Jimmy, Kenneth, Matthew, Nolan, Sarah Ann, Sunni, Trevor, and Vince. They range in age from 25 to 37. Their occupations include being a real estate broker, nurse practitioner, flight attendant, principal, makeup artist, and lawyer.




With Love Is Blind facing some major legal allegations in the last several months, especially after last season, which was deemed lower quality, the series will be one to watch for Netflix viewers. Though the allegations made against the Netflix show haven&#39;t been shown on screen, the issues that past contestants have explained they&#39;ve dealt with on the series are serious and scary, making it clear that there&#39;s room for change on the dating series. For Love Is Blind season 6, all eyes will be on the contestants as they move through the experiment, with some hoping they&#39;ll be able to spot any nefarious behavior from afar.

Though there have been some incredibly successful relationships to come from Love Is Blind, others have had some difficulty sustaining their connection throughout the series and afterward. With a lower success rate than some other reality TV dating shows, Love Is Blind has shown that their experiment can work but doesn&#39;t always offer the results that cast members are looking for. Whether or not the Love Is Blind season 6 cast members find love during their time in the experiment, the season will be an exciting one for the streaming platform.




Love Is Blind season 6 premieres February 14 on Netflix.
