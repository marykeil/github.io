# WoW The War Within Highlights A Serious MMO Problem


## SUMMARY 



  World of Warcraft: The War Within is the MMORPG&#39;s 10th expansion, but it&#39;s stumbled into a brand-new pitfall.   Early access to The War Within is locked behind the expansion&#39;s Epid Edition, which bears a higher price tag.   This early access period will only splinter the player base, which is especially problematic for an MMO.

## Literature Review

Upcoming expansion The War Within is doing something that World of Warcraft hasn&#39;t done before, and it represents a concerning industry trend.




World of Warcraft: The War Within is the next expansion to the eternally popular MMORPG, but one problem with its approach is obvious even well ahead of its release. With a total of nine expansions under its belt, World of Warcraft is no stranger to making major additions. Some, like the iconic Wrath of the Lich King, have met with widespread positive reception, while others have received more mixed opinions. No matter how good the content in The War Within may be, however, it&#39;s hard to come to terms with a particular decision involving its launch.




The War Within is certainly going to be a major part of World of Warcraft&#39;s future, acting as the first installment of a planned trio of expansions. Referred to as The Worldsoul Saga, this trilogy is connected by an overarching narrative, which promises to wrap up many aspects of the game&#39;s story so far and set up the future for the game. World of Warcraft expansions tend to be regular, coming out every couple of years, so even if the pace of releases doesn&#39;t end up increasing, the overall picture should be able to complete itself at a reasonable rate.

 WoW: The War Within Early Access Costs Too Much 
         

The big problem with World of Warcraft: The War Within lies in its release strategy, as the Epic Edition offers early access to the experience at a premium price. While the expansion itself can be bought for $49.99, getting the full roster of extra goodies and early access costs $89.99, nearly double the cost. The pricing model isn&#39;t new, but this particular perk is, and it introduces an inherent disparity that can only be seen as concerning for the health of the game and general satisfaction of the community.






Pre-orders of The War Within come with the current expansion, Dragonflight, which is one positive note that represents a change from past approaches.




Time is a valuable resource in MMORPGs, especially one with a fanbase as dedicated as World of Warcraft. Paying to get a head start on The War Within makes it possible for those with the extra cash to level up and grab top placements quickly, leaving anyone who doesn&#39;t want to accept the exorbitant price tag in the dust. This could easily split up guilds trying to complete raids when the expansion drops, as getting everyone on board is likely to prove difficult. An early access window of three days might not seem that bad on a single-player game, but it&#39;s extraordinarily significant in this kind of context.

 WoW Isn&#39;t The Only Game Charging For Early Access 
          

The whole idea of paying to start a game a few days early is a relatively new one in terms of wide-scale market application, but it hasn&#39;t taken long for many publishers to get on board. Franchises like Call of Duty pushed a lot of momentum behind the idea of early access as a pre-order bonus, although even in the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, this perk applies to standard pre-orders as well as the Vault Edition. Although this is itself a generally unpleasant implementation, doling out an arbitrary penalty to those uncertain about committing to a pre-order, it does at least have the advantage of economic equality.

Starfield provides one recent example of a major game locking the jump start behind an upgrade, with five extra days ahead of launch granted to anyone willing to buy the $99.99 Digital Premium Edition or the $299.99 Constellation Edition. Mortal Kombat 1 followed the same timing model but increased the basic threshold even higher with a $109.99 Premium Edition (and a comparatively cheaper $249.99 Kollector&#39;s Edition). Taking the model set by these titles and extending it to systems like MMOs poses significant concerns for not only World of Warcraft but the general industry, adding one more pay-to-win component to games that have plenty of monetization models already.




                  Looks Like The $300 Starfield Constellation Edition May Have Been A Waste After All   Starfield&#39;s $300 Constellation Edition came with a fully functional LPV6 Chronomark Smartwatch; however, there are major issues after little use.   



 The War Within Early Access Restrictions Aren&#39;t Enough 
          

The only real mitigating factor to the obvious harm that World of Warcraft: The War Within&#39;s early access model could do comes in the form of locking off &#34;certain endgame features&#34; during the period, as indicated in a disclaimer on the expansion&#39;s official Battle.net product page. Mythic dungeons and weekly quests are called out in particular, which should stop at least some epic gear from being distributed during this period. Although this concession is certainly helpful, it&#39;s ultimately a flimsy counter to the overall problem.




At the end of the day, a head start is a head start, and there are plenty of other avenues for strong gear than the ones mentioned here. This also does nothing to address the fundamental problem of splitting up guilds, as anyone who doesn&#39;t purchase the Epic Edition will still be heavily desynchronized from guildmates who do. Early access players can speed through other content during the three-day period and jump into the restricted endgame material after it&#39;s available while others are still catching up, so this only slightly delays the inevitable of the Epic Edition ticket to advance completion.

 WoW: The War Within Community Feedback Is Healthy 
          




The one good thing to come from the announcement of World of Warcraft: The War Within&#39;s release model is the immediate outcry that it provoked from players, with many members of the community decrying its division of the player base. Making it clear that this system is unacceptable can prove that Blizzard can&#39;t get away with unfair pricing models, especially if guilds stick to the regular release date and ignore the incentive to pay. If the model proves to hurt The War Within&#39;s launch and the game&#39;s relationship with its community, it could be avoided in future expansions, but that could take an overall boycott to be successful.

Although World of Warcraft has had plenty of ups and downs over the year, few of its foibles have been as fundamentally exploitative as charging for early access to a major expansion. Sticking to an access window model based on pre-orders like Final Fantasy 14 and similar MMOs would be much fairer to the community, even if it didn&#39;t offer as much incentive for Epic Edition purchases. World of Warcraft: The War Within could be a great expansion, but all of that might be clouded by one attempt to generate extra income at launch.
