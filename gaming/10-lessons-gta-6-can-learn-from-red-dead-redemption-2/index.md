## Literature Review

GTA 6 doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it should borrow heavily from and improve on the Rockstar games before it. Here’s what it can take from RDR 2.




Grand Theft Auto 6 has a lot to learn from Red Dead Redemption 2. The GTA and RDR series have always filled different niches, but the two are undeniably similar and can influence each other in a variety of ways. The most recent games in each series, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 respectively, are hailed as visual, narrative, and gameplay masterpieces. They&#39;ve set many trends in the open world and third-person shooter genres - trends that each one&#39;s next title should seek to follow.
But at the same time, neither game is absolutely perfect. Both have their flaws, and while many of GTA 5&#39;s can be explained away by the fact that it&#39;s an older game from two console generations ago, some of RDR 2&#39;s have only become more glaring in the five years since its launch. Whether from RDR 2&#39;s successes or failures, here are ten lessons that GTA 6 should learn.
            
 
 GTA 6 Can Improve These Overlooked Grand Theft Auto Mechanics 
Grand Theft Auto 6 can take a lot of inspiration from past games, and that includes reworking some of their less-famous features into a new form.












 








 9  No Crunch 
Crunch Time Hurts Developers And Players Both
        

Crunch refers to a harmful workplace culture in which developers are made to work overly long hours in order to reach strict deadlines. It has touched almost every corner of the video game industry, and according to a former Rockstar dev, the original Red Dead Redemption was developed under severe crunch. It&#39;s not only bad for developers, who must sacrifice their own health and personal relationships during periods of crunch, but also for the games they make. Rushing GTA 6 out could result in a buggy, blatantly flawed game, but ensuring that it&#39;s completely finished before it ships, even if it takes a few extra months, creates a quality product.





 8  Hyperrealistic World Design 
RDR 2&#39;s World Was Beautiful, And GTA 6&#39;s Should Be, Too


 







Sometimes, RDR 2&#39;s visuals look so realistic that it&#39;s difficult to tell RDR 2 screenshots from photos. At times, RDR 2 can be stunning. Looking back at horse tracks in the desert sand, gazing out at distant hills, watching the wind ruffle the grass across a vast plain - these images are moving and enduring, a large part of what makes RDR 2 so engaging. GTA 5 looks great, especially for its time, but a decade later, standards have changed. Wherever GTA 6 is set, its landscape should be rendered with the same stunning beauty and meticulous attention to detail.





 7  Better Random Encounters &amp; Side Jobs 
RDR 2 Sets A Standard That GTA 6 Should Follow
        

As good as its main story is, RDR 2&#39;s side content is even better. Whether it&#39;s casing general stores before the posse robs them, hunting legendary animals, or finding the Klan and burning them alive, almost every side mission in RDR 2 is unique, enjoyable, and impactful. GTA 5 has a similar feature - the Strangers and Freaks missions spread throughout Los Santos - but they pale in comparison. GTA&#39;s side missions don&#39;t tend to take themselves quite as seriously. They&#39;re usually pretty brief and spontaneous, and even when they&#39;re not, the characters in them are one-note jokes. A balance of both is fine, but leaning all one way gets repetitive.





 6  Realistic NPCs 
RDR 2&#39;s Greatest Strength Is Its Characters


 







Another thing that gives RDR 2 a lasting impact is its cast of characters. Every major character in the game, especially the ones in Dutch&#39;s camp, is interesting, well-rounded, and realistic. It&#39;s that level of detail that makes players care about the characters they encounter, and makes it hit that much harder when they get hurt or die. As blustery as Dutch himself is, it&#39;s easy to get drawn into his ruse because the player wants to see the camp succeed. After all, they&#39;ve put so much time and money into it. If GTA 6 involves a close-knit gang, its characters should be as well-developed as RDR 2&#39;s.
            
 
 8 Most Wild Rumors About GTA 6 That Are Probably Fake 
There&#39;s a lot of talk and conjecture around the highly-anticipated release of Grand Theft Auto 6, but some of the speculation is totally ridiculous. 








 5  Better Movement 
RDR2&#39;s Traversal Was Too Clunky
        

But for everything it got right, RDR 2 got one major aspect of gameplay wrong: its movement systems were incredibly awkward. Whether it was crashing into a door frame because there wasn&#39;t enough time to correct course, or flying across the map because Arthur&#39;s horse stepped on a pebble, getting around in RDR 2 wasn&#39;t easy. If GTA 6 uses the same version of Rockstar&#39;s game engine as RDR 2, hopefully its movement mechanics will be greatly improved upon.





 4  Morality 
GTA 6 Should Have An Honor System
        

RDR 2&#39;s morality system is a fascinating feature, keeping track of all the player&#39;s choices to place them on a sliding scale between good and bad. Of course, the average Red Dead game has more chances to do good than the average GTA, and the latter&#39;s sillier, more gleefully violent tone might clash with a system that chides players for their crimes. However, it&#39;d be interesting to have the opportunity for a Robin Hood-esque, antihero protagonist in GTA 6. And watching NPCs realistically respond to player actions is always fun.





 3  Car Storage And Cleaning 
Inspired By RDR 2&#39;s Horse


 







RDR 2&#39;s horses and GTA 5&#39;s cars share many functions: they&#39;re how players get around, get away from the police, and get faster over time. They differ in a few crucial ways: RDR 2 allows players to store spare items in their horses&#39; saddlebags, retrieving curatives and crafting ingredients as needed. GTA 6&#39;s cars could have a similar function, with their trunks serving as mobile storage for spare items and ammo. Horses also need to be brushed and fed regularly, and while it&#39;s hard to say the same for cars, a system of car maintenance involving gas refills and regular cleanings could add an interesting dimension to gameplay.





 2  Mini-Games 
RDR 2&#39;s Casino-Style Gambling Should Be In GTA
        

While it&#39;d be hard to transfer some of GTA 5&#39;s more decidedly modern mini-games into the world of Red Dead Redemption - golf, tennis, and car racing come to mind - there are certainly mini-games in RDR 2 that have their place in GTA 6. Red Dead&#39;s card games, like blackjack and poker, just make sense in the context of GTA&#39;s risk and reward scenarios. GTA 6 could even include a wider variety of casino-style diversions, like roulette, slots, and craps, to round out an in-game gambling palace.





 1  Better Online Support 
GTA Online Needs To Learn From Red Dead Online&#39;s Failure
        

Red Dead Online&#39;s untimely death was a major disappointment, especially for players who sunk so much time into it. It&#39;s unlikely that GTA 6&#39;s online mode, whatever that might look like, will meet the exact same fate. Its current version is too successful for an early shutdown - but then again, Red Dead Online was also performing pretty well near its end. One way or another, it&#39;d be a mistake to shut down GTA 6&#39;s multiplayer mode too early. Without an enduring online mode, GTA 6 wouldn&#39;t have the same staying power, and if it ever got a sequel, it wouldn&#39;t generate near as much hype.
For the time being, there&#39;s no way to tell what lessons RDR 2 might have taught GTA 6. Rockstar does seem to be aware that its games don&#39;t exist in a vacuum, and frequently makes incremental improvements from one release to the next. But until more is revealed about Grand Theft Auto 6, it&#39;s impossible to compare it to Red Dead Redemption 2.
