## Literature Review

You can pay parrots in Stardew Valley a unique currency called Golden Walnuts for rewards, but every one of these items are in hard-to-find locations.





You only need 116 out of the 130 Golden Walnuts found in Stardew Valley to unlock every reward offered by the parrots in the game. Those who aren&#39;t sure how many Walnuts they&#39;ve already collected can visit the parrot in Leo&#39;s house, which gives hints depending on how many Walnuts are left in an area. These changing clues should give you a good idea about how many items are yet to be found.






If you manage to find every single Golden Walnut, use the remaining 14 to buy 28 Qi Gems after you unlock Mr. Qi&#39;s special reward room in Stardew Valley.
