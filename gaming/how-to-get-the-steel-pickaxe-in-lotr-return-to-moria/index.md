## Literature Review

Reaching new areas will prove impossible without a Steel Pickaxe in Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, so crafting one quickly is important.





Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is a new survival crafting game that allows them to take control of a sturdy Dwarf to craft and build new items. These Dwarves are hardy and will need to stay on their toes to face the darkness of Moria and return to the surface. Once they have reignited the furnace, it will be time to figure out how to make a Steel Pickaxe to continue their journey.




                  LotR: Return to Moria - How to Repair Weapons, Armor, &amp; Tools   In Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, the Dwarves will find their equipment needs repair at which point they can put their craftsmen skills to use.    


 Forging a Steel Pickaxe in LotR: Return to Moria 
          

To begin with, players will need to have reached the Elven Quarters and repaired the Great Forge of Narvi. This is the same time that players can also increase their inventory in Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. The Great Forge will unlock many new things the players can build or craft, but a Steel Pickaxe should be a priority for anyone hoping to dig deeper.



The Elven Quarters are the second major area of the game, so if you haven&#39;t reached them yet keep breaking the Dirt barriers and you will find them fairly quickly. It is also possible to rush to this area of the game, although you might find yourself short on the proper equipment to make it worth it.







The recipe for the Steel Pickaxe is as follows:

 Ingredient  Quantity   Steel Ingots  x3   Elven Wood  x4   Hide  x1   



Elven Wood will become available as well once the Elven Quarters are reached, so any tree in this area should give you Elven Wood when itâ€™s cut down. Likewise, Hide is available from nearly any animal you hunt, so you likely will already have one piece of Hide to use. The tricky part of this recipe is finding the Steel Ingots, as they have to be made rather than found.

To craft a Steel Ingot, players will have to use the forge to combine Iron with Coal, one of the most in-demand resources in Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. Players will need 3 of each ingredient to make a single Steel Ingot, so they will need a total of 9 Iron and 9 Coal to make enough for the Steel Pickaxe. Once they have all the ingredients, throw them in the Forge to make the Steel Pickaxe and wait for it to finish cooking.




Once completed, players will be able to find their way through any Compacted Dirt barriers, and it will be possible to keep exploring. Use that newly available inventory space to keep all the new materials, and remember that any equipment can be repaired in Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, so you never have to craft a new Steel Pickaxe again.
