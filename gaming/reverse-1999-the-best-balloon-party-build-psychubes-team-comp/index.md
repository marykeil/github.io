## Literature Review

Balloon Party is a unique healer compared to the rest of Reverse: 1999&#39;s roster, as she heals based on an ally&#39;s Lost HP rather than her own ATK.





Balloon Party also has two key buffs she shares with herself and the team. Her first, Party Balloon, damages anyone who attacks the person with the status. The second, Balloon of Innocence, reduces DMG Taken by 25% while healing the wearer. This makes her one of the best healers in the game, punishing enemies for their attacks and keeping allies alive.




                  Reverse 1999: The Best Medicine Pocket Build (Psychubes &amp; Team Comp)   Medicine Pocket is the best healer in Reverse: 1999, but the right healing Psychubes and powerful team comps can make them even better.   


 The Best Psychubes For Balloon Party 
          



Balloon Party has limited Psychube options as of Reverse: 1999&#39;s global launch. As such, you will need to be picky about what you need most from her Psychube. How often must you cast Balloon Party&#39;s healing Incantation, Coughing Weirdo? Do you want strong stats or a useful Amplification? Balloon Party&#39;s best Psychube will depend on your priorities.




That Inquisitive Dear is the go-to Psychube for healers like Balloon Party, but sadly, Balloon Party cannot utilize Psychube&#39;s Amplification. That Inquisitive Dear heals the ally with the lowest HP when the carrier casts a debuff. This Psychube was tailored for Sotheby and her Poison status. Balloon Party has no debuff Incantations that could trigger this Amplification. However, it still works for her thanks to its 18% bonus to Healing Done at Level 60.




                  Reverse 1999: The Best Dikke Build (Psychubes &amp; Team Comp)   Dikke acts as both a F2P healer and sub-DPS in Reverse 1999. If you want to use her, build her like a DPS and have her teammates cover utilities.   

Her Second Life is the opposite of That Inquisitive Dear: a useful Amplification but less-than-applicable stats. Since Balloon Party does not heal based on ATK, this Psychube&#39;s ATK bonus is wasted on her. However, Her Second Life improves the healing efficiency of Balloon Party&#39;s Ultimate, Good Kids, Bad Adults. All of Balloon Party&#39;s allies will heal by up to 64% of their ATK after she casts Good Kids, Bad Adults. Since any healing bonus is a good bonus, this Psychube can prove useful.

Laughter and Laughter is weaker than Balloon Party&#39;s 6-Star Psychube options in Reverse: 1999, but at least she benefits from its stats and Amplification. Laughter and Laughter provides a DMG Taken Reduction of up to 10% and encourages players to wait before casting Coughing Weirdo. At the beginning of each round, Balloon Party gets one stack of Healing Done &#43;3%. She can hold up to eight stacks when the Amplification is fully leveled, improving Coughing Weirdo&#39;s effectiveness.




Decode is similar to Laughter and Laughter, as it is another 5-Star Psychube with useful stats and Amplification that remains weaker than That Inquisitive Dear or Her Second Life. Decode provides up to 15% more Healing Done and reduces DMG Taken from Ultimates by up to 20%. This is a rather narrow Amplification, but it proves useful against enemies with ultra-powerful Ultimates.



 The Best Team Comps For Balloon Party 
         

Balloon Party is a great healer for many team comps, but her healing works best with characters who consistently lose a lot of HP. This could mean the character has an ability that injures them, or they lack any defensive passives. Balloon Party works well with characters who need Positive Statuses to achieve special effects but struggle to apply those statuses themselves.

Eternity in Reverse: 1999 desperately needs a strong healer, and Balloon Party&#39;s Lost HP-based healing works exceptionally well for her. As Eternity casts her Incantations, she will lose 10% of her HP. She makes up for this lost HP with DMG Healing and debuff immunities, but she still needs a healer to keep her alive, especially when she lacks Insight upgrades. Since Balloon Party scales on her target&#39;s Lost HP, Eternity will get a stronger HP boost the closer she is to death.




Druvis III could benefit from Balloon Party&#39;s balloons if she has Insight One unlocked. When Druvis III has a Positive Status at Insight One, she gets a 20% bonus from DMG Dealt. Balloon Party can easily apply the needed Positive Status, but her Reality DMG can conflict with Druvis III&#39;s Petrify status. If you pair these characters together, be careful who Balloon Party attacks.

Charlie is another character who needs Positive Statuses to get some of her bonuses, but these bonuses conflict less with Balloon Party than Druvis III. When Charlie casts Thunder To Thee! with a Positive Status or boosted stats, she deals more Mental DMG. If Charlie has any Insight unlocked, she can supply this bonus herself. However, if you don&#39;t have her Insight, Balloon Party can support her thunderous attacks.

Moving onto supports, Balloon Party is the best healer to work with Bkornblume from Reverse: 1999. Bkornblume requires a team of Reality-DMG characters to benefit from her debuff Incantation, Prying Ear. This Incantation makes enemies more susceptible to Reality DMG. This improves Balloon Party&#39;s attacks while synergizing with Party Balloon and Balloon of Innocence.






A team comp with Balloon Party and Bkornblume would weaken enemies and strengthen allies against them.




Voyager&#39;s kit synergizes perfectly with Balloon Party, as her buffs resemble Party Balloon and Balloon of Innocence. Interstellar Symphony is Voyager&#39;s equivalent to Party Balloon, as it deals DMG against attacking enemies based on Voyager&#39;s ATK. Meanwhile, Sturdiness provides a DMG Taken Reduction of 25% for one round, just like Balloon of Innocence. Voyager can cast her buffs when Balloon Party cannot, and vice versa, for some excellent teamwork.

Balloon Party requires a bit of work to keep her balloons on the field consistently. However, even Medicine Pocket struggles to match her strength against enemies with powerful attacks. Balloon Party&#39;s skills erase a strong enemy&#39;s efforts and make future attacks seem pathetic. As such, she is an excellent choice for a healer in Reverse: 1999.
