## Literature Review

Hogwarts Legacy takes place long before Harry Potter is born, but it features plenty of characters whose descendants appear in the books and movies.




Hogwarts Legacy is set in the 1800s, long before any of the events in the Harry Potter series take place. Despite that, Hogwarts&#39; magical campus is full of familiar names, but the familial relationships may not be obvious, especially for those who haven&#39;t read the books. Going through and seeing which characters from Hogwarts Legacy are related to characters from the novels can make the next playthrough a bit more interesting.
For some characters, the connection between Harry Potter book characters is obvious. This is the case with people like Phineas Black or the Weasleys who are mentioned. However, how they&#39;re related to book characters can be harder to pinpoint exactly, considering the time frame between Hogwarts Legacy and Harry&#39;s own wizarding adventure. But speculation is possible, and in some cases, there&#39;s enough information to make a good guess.
            
 
 Every Hogwarts Legacy Ending Explained (In Detail) 
Although players are free to make choices throughout the game, one decision in particular determines which Hogwarts Legacy ending they receive.












 








 11  Professor Matilda Weasley 
Ron Weasley&#39;s Relative
        

Matilda Weasley acts as the Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts during the time that Hogwarts Legacy takes place. Naturally, it&#39;s no mystery that Matilda is related to Ron Weasley and the rest of the Weasley family, but pinpointing the exact relationship is a bit harder in her case. While it&#39;s possible that she&#39;s married and could have children that make her a direct ancestor, it seems more likely that she&#39;s part of the Weasley extended family, being a distant aunt or cousin of Ron.





 10  Garreth Weasley 
Ron Weasley&#39;s Relative
        

Like Matilda, Garreth is obviously related to Ron and his family. Garreth is a student during Hogwarts Legacy, but there&#39;s evidence pointing to the fact that he&#39;s a direct ancestor of Ron. This means that he could be a great-great-great grandfather to Ron, but that isn&#39;t necessarily the case. Since the Weasleys tend to have multiple children, he could be a distant uncle, with one of his siblings taking the spot of a direct ancestor.





 9  Leander Prewitt 
Ron Weasley&#39;s Relative
        

Leander is a student who duels Sebastian during the first day of classes but isn&#39;t able to defeat him. Even though he doesn&#39;t have the Weasley name, Leander is related to Ron Weasley through his mother, Molly. Before she married into the Weasley family, Molly&#39;s surname was Prewitt. It&#39;s difficult to tell how he&#39;s related to Molly exactly, but it&#39;s safe to say that he&#39;s a direct ancestor or a distant relative with the name Prewitt.





 8  Professor Phineas Nigellus Black 
Sirius Black&#39;s Relative


 







Phineas Nigellus Black is the headmaster of Hogwarts during Hogwarts Legacy, but he&#39;s not suited for the job, and much of his work falls to Matilda Weasley instead. Given his last name, it&#39;s no surprise that he&#39;s related to Sirius Black. Phineas Nigellus is a direct ancestor of Sirius, who&#39;s the last heir of the family by the time the books take place, meaning that he&#39;s his great-great-grandfather.

Headmaster Black&#39;s unfavorable reputation is made obvious, but secret details in Hogwarts Legacy offer an additional view of his life and personality.








 7  Gerbold Ollivander 
Garrick Ollivander&#39;s Relative


 







During Hogwarts Legacy, Gerbold Ollivander runs Ollivander&#39;s in Hogsmeade, taking care of all wand-related needs for the students of Hogwarts. Garrick is Gerbold&#39;s grandson, and he&#39;s part of Harry&#39;s first experiences as a wizard, and seen during his first visit to Diagon Alley. Garrick, as an Ollivander, is responsible for finding the perfect wand for Harry as he prepares for his time at Hogwarts.





 6  Victor Rookwood 
Augustus Rookwood&#39;s Relative
        

Victor Rookwood is one of the main antagonists of Hogwarts Legacy, working with Ranrok to use the power of Ancient Magic. And it turns out that villainy runs in the family, as seen through Augustus&#39; role in Harry Potter as a Death Eater following Voldemort. Although their family relation is clear, it&#39;s not clear if Augustus is a direct descendant or if Victor had siblings who would be direct ancestors.

Charles and Victor Rookwood play two very different roles in the wizarding world, but their connection is integral to Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s story.








 5  Helen Thistlewood 
Cedric Diggory&#39;s Relative
        

Helen Thistlewood is a retired Auror who only appears in Hogwarts Legacy as part of the Hufflepuff House Quest. It turns out that Helen is related to Eldritch Diggory as his great-niece. As a result, Helen is a distant relative of Cedric Diggory, who falls victim to Voldemort&#39;s schemes in Goblet of Fire.
            
 
 There&#39;s Only One Way To Get Into Azkaban In Hogwarts Legacy 
It&#39;s possible to go to Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy, but some preliminary steps are required in order to visit this iconic Harry Potter location.








 4  Hector Jenkins 
Karl Jenkins&#39; Relative
        

Interviews with the developers reveal that Hector was supposed to be Hector Weasley, but in the end, he became Hector Jenkins, a student who participates in the Crossed Wands Duelling Club. Hector&#39;s descendants don&#39;t appear in the main set of books, however, and it&#39;s not clear if he has a direct relation to Karl, or a distant one. Rather than be part of Harry&#39;s adventure, Karl is a classmate of Albus Potter at Hogwarts.





 3  Constance Dagworth 
Hermione Granger&#39;s Possible Relative
        

Hermione is one of the core characters in Harry Potter, and a defining feature for her is being the best witch in her year while having Muggle parents. However, it seems that she could have magic in her blood through distant relatives, such as Constance Dagworth, a member of the Crossed Wands Duelling Club. In the series, Hermione is asked if she&#39;s related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, but she&#39;s not sure. If that&#39;s the case, then she&#39;d be distantly related to Constance.

 2  Poppy Sweeting 
Havelock Sweeting&#39;s Relative


 







Poppy is a Hufflepuff who&#39;s part of the main questline in Hogwarts Legacy, having made friends with Highwing and helping the new fifth-year become acquainted with Highwing before they rescue a dragon together. Instead of having descendants in Harry Potter, Poppy is the descendant, with her ancestor mentioned in the series. Her ancestor, Havelock Sweeting, is seen on a chocolate frog card in the game adaptations of the books.
            
 
 Which Hogwarts Legacy House Is Actually Best 
Although each House offers a unique experience, one Hogwarts Legacy House stands out as the best from a gameplay standpoint (and one as the worst).








 1  Ominis Gaunt 
Voldemort&#39;s Relative
        

Ominis Gaunt isn&#39;t like the rest of his family, who use dark magic for fun, and he&#39;s been personally subjected to the Cruciatus Curse. However, he despises the use of dark magic, unlike his family, who see it as their right to use as descendants of Salazar Slytherin. While Ominis isn&#39;t a direct ancestor of Voldemort, he&#39;s likely his great-uncle, with his sibling being speculated as the great-grandfather of Voldemort.
It can be tough to keep track of all the characters who exist in the world of Harry Potter, especially with how much extra material has been added to the franchise outside the books and main movies. But it&#39;s usually possible to build tentative family trees for a lot of main characters - and some side characters - through names alone. And no matter how accurate the end results of those family trees are, it&#39;s fun to witness the past and guess at who may be related to whom when playing Hogwarts Legacy.
