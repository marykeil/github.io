## Literature Review

With Rust making its way into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#39;s map pool, it&#39;s more important than ever to be equipped with one of the best SMGs.





Aside from SMGs, a few assault rifles, battle rifles, and snipers are making a name for themselves as the best weapons in Modern Warfare 3. Nonetheless, when it comes to multiplayer maps like Shoot House and game modes like Zombies, these SMGs are the answer to your problems.

 8  Fennec 45 
Fast Fire Rate at its Forefront
        

Because of its insanely fast fire rate, the Fennec 45 is an SMG-class staple. However, that fire rate comes with a lot of recoil, which can lead to poor accuracy. Furthermore, the bullet spread makes it almost impossible to hit enemies at a distance. As a result, the Fennec 45 is best used in close-quarters maps, where you are face-to-face with the enemy, such as Rust.
Aside from that, the Fennec 45 is one of the most enjoyable SMGs due to its high rate of fire. Furthermore, there are some builds for this gun that, with the right attachments, can turn it into a laser beam and give it some much-needed range.





 7  Lachmann Shroud 
A Great Pick For Beginners


 







The Lachmann Shroud is a fan-favorite SMG returning from MW2. Although it fires at a slower rate than most of the other SMGs on this list, it makes up for it with great range, damage, and a recoil that&#39;s easy to control. However, the most notable feature of this SMG is its built-in suppressor, which prevents you from appearing on the mini-map when you shoot. That is a huge reason why it&#39;s one of the best weapons for beginners in Modern Warfare 3.





 6  Lachmann Sub 
The Lachmann Shroud&#39;s Younger Brother
        

The Lachmann Sub is the younger brother of the Lachman Shroud. This version sacrifices damage and range for a faster rate of fire and improved mobility. And, while it can be outfitted with a suppressor, it does not readily come with one. Regardless, the Lachmann Sub is a much faster-paced version of the Lachmann Shroud that caters to a more active and rapid play style.





 5  WSP Swarm 
It Doesn&#39;t Get Smaller Than This
        

If you didn&#39;t think it could get more compact than the Lachmann Sub, consider the WSP Swarm. This is one of the best SMGs for movement in Modern Warfare 3, allowing you to quickly buzz around the map. It&#39;s no secret that it could benefit from some attachments, as its high mobility and rate of fire will only win in the right engagements. Nonetheless, while most other SMGs outperform it, the WSP Swarm is a sleeper pick on many maps and in many game modes due to the mobility it provides.





 4  AMR9 
New and Popular Kid On The Block
        

The AMR9 is a new SMG in Modern Warfare 3 that can be unlocked at level 4, and it&#39;s quickly established itself as one of the best in the game. In comparison to the Fennec 45, the AMR9 does more damage and is arguably just as, if not more, effective at close range. Moreover, despite its close-range focus, the AMR9 is a highly versatile SMG that can be configured in various ways. As a result, you can adapt this gun to compete at medium range, which many players do.





 3  Striker 9 
A More Compact Version of The Best SMG
        

You unlock the Striker 9 at level 25 Armory Challenges. And, to put it frankly, it&#39;s not as good as the normal Striker, which you unlock as early as level four. That being said, just because Striker 9 doesn&#39;t live up to its older brother&#39;s standards doesn&#39;t mean it should be overlooked. The Striker 9 remains one of the best SMGs in the game, with a high damage output for its play style. However, as with the Lachman Shroud/Sub and WSP-9/Swarm, the more compact model is designed to sacrifice some of that damage and range for a higher rate of fire.





 2  Rival-9 
Fan-Favourite


 







The Rival-9 is another new weapon in Modern Warfare 3 that&#39;s quickly making a name for itself. In fact, many players consider the Rival-9 the game&#39;s best SMG owing to the weapon&#39;s high fire rate and low recoil, which will almost certainly be nerfed at some point.
On the other hand, some players dislike the Rival-9 due to its limited range and the fact that it is unavailable until Level 25. It&#39;s a pretty similar situation with the Striker-9. And it wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the best SMG in the game is available as early as level four and can outperform both the Rival-9 and Striker-9 at range.
Because many of the SMGs on this list, such as the WSP Swarm, Rival-9, and Striker-9, are available at higher levels, you should be aware of the fastest ways to earn XP. 






 1  Striker 
It Doesn&#39;t Get Better Than This


 







The Striker, formerly known as the UMP-45 back in the original game, is undoubtedly the best SMG in the Modern Warfare 3 remake. This should be no surprise, given that the Striker is the ideal cross between an SMG and an assault rifle. As a result, it can be built to excel in either style and will most likely do so with flying colors.
The Striker has the highest damage out of any SMG. On top of that, it boasts an even keel across every stat, not lacking in one particular category - unlike the other SMGs in this list that sacrifice one stat in favor of another. So, look no further than the Striker as the main SMG to run in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.
