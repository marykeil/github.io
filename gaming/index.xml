      <description>SUMMARYCyberpunk 2077 contains hidden graffiti that references the downfall of V&amp;rsquo;s friend.

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is limited to only 11 playable races, far fewer than are in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5e. A mod addresses this, adding over 50 new playable races to BG3. The mod adds many races from 5e, but also from other games and popular homebrew settings.&#xA;Literature ReviewBeing able to choose from dozens of different races and lineages is part of what makes D&amp;amp;D so fun, and this mod gives Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate over 50 new ones.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPatch 5 for Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 introduces a new epilogue, which offers more closure for Lae&amp;rsquo;zel. Lae&amp;rsquo;zel&amp;rsquo;s hidden epilogue is tied to the githyanki egg quest, and is easily missed because of certain choices provided to the player through dialog. Lae&amp;rsquo;zel&amp;rsquo;s journey in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is difficult but transformative, and she deserves the happy ending provided by this epilogue after facing uncomfortable truths throughout the game.&#xA;Literature ReviewPatch 5 added a secret epilogue for Lae’zel among its many changes, and it makes a major choice at the end of Act 1 worth skipping completely.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYRomancing Lae&amp;rsquo;zel in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 requires dedication and patience, but it leads to one of the most rewarding character arcs in the game. Lae&amp;rsquo;zel prefers directness and violence, appreciating decisions that demonstrate intimidation or dominance, making her a unique romance option. Pursuing a relationship with Lae&amp;rsquo;zel means being unable to romance other Origin characters, like Shadowheart.&#xA;Literature ReviewMaintaining a true emotional connection with the githyanki warrior might be harder than one would think, but the payoff is totally worth it.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe race of characters in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 affects many different situation and interactions. Despite this, BG3 rarely gets in-depth with the Forgotten Realms&amp;rsquo; lore, which is instead expounded upon in a number of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons sourcebooks. The long histories of the drow and githyanki races, for instance, are alluded to in BG3, but it&amp;rsquo;s never fully explained why most other races hate or fear them.&#xA;Literature ReviewBaldur’s Gate 3 features a fraction of races seen in the Forgotten Realms, but it doesn’t fully explain the dynamics and nuances between them.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is full of memorable companions, but Scratch is one of the best, despite not being a companion in the traditional sense. While Scratch may not have a rich story or engaging banter like other party members, he is low maintenance and worth having around for his genuinely helpful abilities. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget about summoning Scratch amid the chaos of managing a party, but he should not be overlooked as he can provide valuable support and add an enjoyable element to the game.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 features intimidating bosses, including the creepy Spectator, which resembles the iconic Beholder from D&amp;amp;D. The Spectator in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 has powerful eye rays that can disable opponents, although it is weaker than a Beholder. Beholders, along with other iconic creatures like orcs and wyverns, did not make it into Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, but the game still offers a variety of challenging enemies.&#xA;Literature ReviewBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 doesn&amp;rsquo;t tend to hold back from grisly foes, but one of D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s most fearsome enemies didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to make the cut in its full form.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can be enjoyed without prior D&amp;amp;D knowledge, but some context may be missing for those unfamiliar with the Forgotten Realms. The game provides information about enemies like the illithid, but there is a lot more to know about their society and the world of the Forgotten Realms. The Netherbrain, the game&amp;rsquo;s antagonist, is unique among illithid elder brains, created out of circumstances directly related to BG3, not D&amp;amp;D at large.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe protagonist in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can out-magic even the most advanced spellcasters due to the player&amp;rsquo;s ability to save scum. Save scumming in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 mimics the effects of chronomancy, a school of magic not seen in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons since its second edition. The prevalence of save scumming in BG3 suggests that players enjoy the idea of turning back the clock, making a case for the reintroduction of chronomancy in official DnD material.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 replicates the thrill of DnD skill checks with visible dice rolls, sacrificing efficiency and immersion for the sake of replicating the tabletop game. The limited dice color options in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 are disappointing considering the popularity of unique designs with DnD players. While more dice options may come in the future, players can currently turn to mods for custom designs, showing the community&amp;rsquo;s love for dice.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYA Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 interaction offers a very powerful potion, but getting it involves taking advantage of Astarion. A character named Araj in Moonrise Towers offers a Potion of Everlasting Vigor in exchange for Astarion drinking her blood. Forcing Astarion to drink Araj&amp;rsquo;s blood will cause him to end any romance he may have with the player character, unless they manipulate Astarion further.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne choice in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 seems like a cruel approach to companionship, but it&amp;rsquo;s the only way to get maximal benefits from a unique situation.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 offers choices that impact the narrative, but some players are missing out on a crucial area that affects a key companion&amp;rsquo;s personal quest. Both the Underdark and the Mountain Pass can be visited in the game, but many players are unaware of this and are choosing one over the other based on gameplay difficulty instead of narrative reasons. The Mountain Pass is crucial for Lae&amp;rsquo;zel&amp;rsquo;s personal quest, as it is the home of the githyanki crèche where she believes she can find a cure for the mind flayer parasite.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAraj Oblodra in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 offers unique potions in exchange for a vial of True Soul blood. The potions offered by Araj are dependent on the player character&amp;rsquo;s race, are stackable, and can be useful in certain situations. Astarion has a separate deal with Araj where she offers a powerful potion in exchange for him biting her, but forcefully making him do so can have negative consequences.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe mysterious drow alchemist Araj Oblodra has an interesting offer for the party when they meet her in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, but is it worth it?</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGale&amp;rsquo;s stories about his magical abilities don&amp;rsquo;t add up, suggesting that he might be a rare sorcerer instead of a wizard. There are inconsistencies between how wizards typically gain their magic in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and Gale&amp;rsquo;s claims about his magic. There is evidence that Gale was unusually powerful even before the events of Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, possibly rivaling Elminster, and Mystra showed interest in him due to his extraordinary abilities.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Heavy is the most devastating class in The Finals. But, it is slow and easy to hit. This means you want to secure areas to be ready for the enemy.&#xA;Due to the lack of mobility, Heavy characters rely more on team composition. You will want to create opportunities for Light builds in The Finals to ambush and flank. You will also want to stick close to Medium-class players who offer support and protection.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Light class is the fastest option in The Finals.

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Medium fits well on any team in The Finals. It is versatile and leans towards support, but can still contribute good damage with a good build.&#xA;The Medium class is the glue that will hold the rest of the team together. You often want to be close to at least one of your allies. If you instead feel like roaming the map solo, a stealthy Light class build would be a better fit.</description>

These tools never use ammo, have to be reloaded, or need to be repaired in any way.

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 touches on violent and tragic associations of DnD races, but some fantasy races, like gnolls, are left unexplored in terms of their creepy lore. The story of Yeenoghu, the god of gnolls, could have added more intrigue and peril to Act 1 of Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, as it aligns thematically with the game&amp;rsquo;s exploration of loyalty and agency. The gnoll encounter in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 represents a significant difficulty spike and could benefit from more build-up and exploration through a quest line to enhance the player experience.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe first act of Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 revolves in part around the Emerald Grove, where a group of druids is poised to massacre tiefling refugees. One route through the conflict will result in maximum bloodshed, essentially leaving the grove unoccupied. This route is arguably more evil than simply siding with Minthara and letting the goblins destroy the grove.&#xA;Literature ReviewIt&amp;rsquo;s easy for the Emerald Grove situation in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 to end in violence, but one specific method has the most horrific results.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 has impressed players with its wide variety of character choices, deep customization, and intricate mechanics. Larian&amp;rsquo;s CEO Swen Vincke has promised to &amp;ldquo;push boundaries&amp;rdquo; with the next big game, but it is too early to know what it will be or if it will live up to expectations. The next game could be another Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate, another Divinity, or something else entirely.&#xA;Literature ReviewLarian has promised big things after Baldur’s Gate 3, but is it too early to make that kind of guarantee?</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewBecoming a Fashion Designer is one of the most desirable occupations in Bitlife, but as with all other careers, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to work hard to get it.&#xA;Fortunately, unlike becoming an Astronaut in BitLife, you do not need to purchase any extra packs to pursue this career. Furthermore, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go as far as getting a STEM degree, either. Therefore, becoming a Graphic Designer is a bit easier than some other game careers.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewGetting a STEM degree in BitLife is not as easy as players are required to attend a University and study majors like Engineering or Mathematics.&#xA;Getting a STEM degree in BitLife works very similar to real life. You will be required to be an expert in subjects like Chemistry, Physics amongst others. To get a degree in one of the fields of study, you will need to apply to a University, and once you are accepted, you will have a choice to select a subject.</description>

This is because you must amass a large sum of money throughout your life by wagering, and let&amp;rsquo;s just say the house isn&amp;rsquo;t always on your side.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe WorldSoul Saga, a series of expansions in World of Warcraft, will have a faster content rollout than previous expansions, with more parallel work and multiple teams working on different expansions simultaneously. The WorldSoul Saga will offer a cohesive narrative across the expansions but will also have independent and exciting standalone stories in each expansion&amp;rsquo;s zones, quests, and world-building. The Early Access period for The War Within expansion will not provide access to max-level content, such as Mythic raiding or dungeons, to ensure a leisurely start to the campaign and prevent players from feeling pressured to join Early Access.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBreath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom celebrate the franchise&amp;rsquo;s history, but ignore the important Golden Goddesses and their role in creating Hyrule and the Triforce.

The absence of the Golden Goddesses could be temporary, and future Zelda games may explore their mythology and bring them back into prominence.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild provides an answer to why Link is a silent protagonist. Aside from certain interjections, Link has never been fully voiced throughout the entirety of the Zelda series. BOTW explains why its Link is so quiet, but it also highlights a fallacy in perceiving Link as a true silent protagonist.&#xA;Literature ReviewBOTW gives a narrative justification for why Link is always silent, but it also feeds into a misconception about The Legend of Zelda’s protagonist.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe true ending of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild can be unlocked by finding all of Link&amp;rsquo;s forgotten memories before defeating Calamity Ganon. The difference between the two endings is minimal, with the true ending simply providing an extra cutscene and wrapping up the story more neatly. The true ending leads seamlessly into the sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, as it connects to a memory where Link returns the Master Sword to its pedestal in Korok Forest.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBully 2 should move away from the concept of &amp;ldquo;Grand Theft Auto in school&amp;rdquo; and instead mimic the fresh and unique setting of Red Dead Redemption games. A one-room schoolhouse in an old west setting could allow Bully 2 to focus on a core group of characters, building relationships and exploring the impact of the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s actions on NPCs. Bully 2 would offer a new take on the American west, allowing Rockstar to explore subversions and satirical criticisms within the tropes of the genre, while maintaining authenticity and avoiding glorification.</description>

The developers have been patching the game to fix such exploits, so players interested in trying this trick should do so soon.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewStarter Pals in Palworld are easily found in the opening area of the game, but players might want to think about which one to choose.&#xA;While Palworld may look like a Pokémon rip-off, there are several key differences. One of the main ones is that players will be able to acquire the other “starters” in Palworld from the beginning. This is partially because there are no real starters, just lower-leveled Pals that players can capture without needing a whole squad to lower the health first.</description>

The hazardous biomes in The Center, along with the numerous creatures and removal of movement speed as a stat, make it more dangerous for survivors, requiring them to be cautious and adapt their strategies.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYF-Zero 99 is heavily inspired by the original F-Zero from the Super Nintendo, but it&amp;rsquo;s online mulitplayer gameplay is completely novel. An update has added a Classic mode to F-Zero 99, which plays more similarly to the series&amp;rsquo; original. F-Zero 99 has been seen as a way to gauge interest in a new, full F-Zero game, and Classic mode only fuels this theory.&#xA;Literature ReviewA new mode has come to F-Zero 99, and it takes the multiplayer racing game closer to the series&amp;rsquo; roots, giving longtime fans hope for a new game.</description>

Series creator Shigesato Itoi has stated that he is no longer interested in bringing Mother 3 to the US, and that Nintendo may have previously turned down offers from fans to help create a translation. The chance for an official English release of Mother 3 seems to have passed, as Nintendo has missed its window of opportunity and the game remains niche in the US market.</description>

Previous leaks regarding future versions of the game have been accurate, including leaks about Fontaine in Version 4.0. Limited-time maps are common in Genshin Impact before the release of new nations, so the leak about a Fontaine-themed map in Version 4.8 is plausible.&#xA;Literature ReviewNew leaks for Genshin Impact’s Version 3.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile Electro-Charged is not the most popular Elemental Reaction in Genshin Impact, it is quite powerful. Here are the best team comps to trigger it.&#xA;This can be a dangerous reaction to play with, as you are at the risk of getting shocked yourself if you are not careful, but it does pay off when opponents start disappearing from the battlefield. Luckily, there are multiple characters to choose from and various team comps that you can build in order to properly spread Electro-Charged on enemies.</description>

While some Cryo characters like Kaeya and Chongyun are strong choices, others like Aloy and Mika are best ignored for optimized play. Cryo characters come in a large variety when it comes to roles, being able to deal damage, heal, and provide support for the team.&#xA;Literature ReviewGenshin Impact includes multiple characters split between six different elements.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewGather all the Energy Concentrating Components in Genshin Impact, and unlock a special treasure in Fontaine. Here are their exact locations.&#xA;The “Road to the Singularity” World Quest is not particularly long or difficult, but the aforementioned items are part of a side objective that is not too clearly stated by the game. Because of this, locating the seven Energy Concentrating Components scattered across the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region and the Liffey Region can be troublesome.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewCharlotte has three distinct builds in Genshin Impact. Here are the best weapons, Artifacts, stats, and team comps for the Cryo catalyst character.&#xA;Charlotte uses a catalyst in battle and wields a Cryo Vision. Following the release of Wriothesley in Genshin Impact, she is the second character to have such a combination. This specific trait allows all of her Normal and Charged Attacks to be infused with Cryo, meaning she does not need to activate her Skill, Burst, or a special skill to land elemental attacks on enemies.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewYou will need to farm a lot of materials to fully Ascend Chevreuse and her Talents in Genshin Impact. Here’s everything you need to gather.&#xA;In terms of gameplay, Chevreuse is a unique character. Most of the bonuses she provides her team as a support unit are only activated when she is paired up with Pyro and Electro units. As a Pyro character herself, she is best utilized when inserted into Overloaded-based teams.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewBuilding Chevreuse appropriately is the best way of optimizing her as a support and healer unit in her team comps. There is a catch, however.&#xA;She can be added to any regular team comp but works particularly well with parties that rely on Overloaded Elemental Reactions. This is because she grants a Pyro and Electro DMG buff to all party members when she fires an Overcharged Ball with her Elemental Skill – this special ammunition can be obtained from triggering Overloaded with the team comp.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewBuilding Furina can be tough, especially because she can play three different roles in a party. Here are her best builds and teams in Genshin Impact.&#xA;The official reveal of the character confirms all the previous Furina kit leaks in Genshin Impact, showing that she is, in fact, an off-field damage dealer and a healer. As such, Furina essentially has two distinct builds that you can choose from – three if you disregard her as a complete healer and lean into her ATK-buffing build.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewOptimize your acquisition of Lakelight Lily in Genshin Impact by following this farming route and a few other tips that may increase your gains.&#xA;These Local Specialty items only spawn in very specific areas of Fontaine (so far), so you will need to head to a specific island rather than run or swim across the region randomly in search of them.

Here’s how to get it, refine it, and the best characters to equip it with.&#xA;The Ultimate Overlord’s Mega Magic Sword offers some decent stats for a 4-star weapon.

However, Iansan&amp;rsquo;s rumored ranking is not surprising as previous region releases have featured a mix of 4-star and 5-star characters. Even with Iansan&amp;rsquo;s leaked ranking, there may be good news for players who want to integrate her into team comps in Genshin Impact.&#xA;Literature ReviewAccording to leaks, there may be bad news for players looking forward to playing with Iansan, the first character from Genshin Impact’s Natlan region.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThe 25th Anniversary Update to Half-Life includes the ability to play with your friends in multiplayer, but this can be a little tricky to set up.&#xA;Anyone who wants to return to Black Mesa or dive into it for the first time should pick up the game while it is discounted on Steam. This supreme sale during the Anniversary Update will not last forever, but it is the best way to obtain this classic FPS as of this time of writing.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSide quests in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can be easily missed without quest markers or speaking to NPCs, resulting in small moments being overlooked, such as finding a home for a stray cat. Exploring the Underdark in Act 1 can lead to encounters with Derryth and Baelen, apothecaries who need help retrieving Noblestalk. The party&amp;rsquo;s choices can affect the outcome of this section, including whether Baelen dies. If Baelen dies, Derryth can be found alone in Act 3 at Bonecloak&amp;rsquo;s Apothecary, which can lead to a hidden quest and one of the game&amp;rsquo;s few heartwarming endings.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYProject Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, may take place in a real-world location like Chicago in the year 2080, as hinted by a transit poster found in Cyberpunk 2077. The Cyberpunk universe has referenced other real-world locations before, so exploring new American locations in the sequel is a possibility. Chicago already has a detailed backstory in the Cyberpunk universe, including a deadly bio-plague and subsequent reconstruction, making it a potentially interesting setting for Project Orion.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYRDR2 includes a nameless grave marker memorializing Chinese workers who died building the Transcontinental Railroad in the late 19th century. Many Chinese railroad workers were buried in unmarked graves, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely that some were referred to by numbers instead of names. This detail in RDR2 is based on historical fact. RDR2 also references New Orleans&amp;rsquo; original Chinatown, which was forced to move in 1937. The game&amp;rsquo;s recreation provides a respectful nod to this tragic piece of American history.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHogwarts Legacy is set in the 1800s, introducing new characters and exploring the magical world before the events of the Harry Potter series. Some characters in the game, like Matilda Weasley and Garreth Weasley, are directly related to characters from the books, but their exact relationships are harder to determine due to the time frame. Other characters, such as Professor Phineas Nigellus Black, are also related to well-known book characters, providing interesting connections and speculation for players.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYProfessor Matilda Weasley is likely Ron Weasley&amp;rsquo;s great-great-great-great aunt, based on their shared ancestry and the four-generation gap between them. It is unlikely that Professor Weasley has any direct children, as she longed for a more stable lifestyle and is still unmarried during the events of Hogwarts Legacy. While there is a moment in the game where players can choose whether to lie to Professor Weasley, there are no consequences for dodging the truth.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewItems and loot from each deployment in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies are sometimes too abundant to carry, unless you make space for more in your loadout.&#xA;One reason why expanding your inventory is so important comes from the different Schematics in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies, which allow you to craft various weapons and gear.

Instead, rounds fired by Dragon’s Breath stick to whatever they hit and periodically eject incendiary fuel that inflicts Scorch. The longer the Rocket Launcher goes without firing, the more fuel the following shot spreads – additionally, igniting nearby targets helps partially replenish the fuel used by Dragon’s Breath.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewEvery weapon in Hades has four different aspects players can unlock, but the fourth aspect of each has specific requirements Zagreus must complete.&#xA;It is worth pointing out that unlocking all 24 weapons can be difficult, and you may not use different strategies/tactics to unlock every aspect. You will need to meet specific requirements to unlock each aspect, and some of them are quite challenging to acquire. Once you have unlocked every weapon in Hades using Chthonic Keys and have collected at least one Titan Blood, the aspects become available to be unlocked on the next run.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Last Faith has three different endings. You are normally only presented with the bad one. However, collecting items allows access to others.&#xA;Achieving different endings depends on key items in your current inventory. This does require some backtracking and collecting, a typical objective of many other Bloodborne-style pixel games. This is still faster and more concise than playing the entire game twice or thrice.&#xA;: How To Unlock Every Blueprint in The Last Faith</description>

Even if a mage like Leon or Celine seems out of place in the active roster, they can be incredible as an Assault to call in.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYXbox may be planning to bring its major first-party titles to competing platforms like PlayStation 5 and the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor. This new approach deviates from the traditional strategy of console exclusivity and instead focuses on increasing sales of games overall. Xbox&amp;rsquo;s potential shift towards multi-platform releases could go beyond promises made by Microsoft in its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which promised to keep only Call of Duty multi-platform for at least another decade.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will build on the previous game&amp;rsquo;s combat, but should skip one particular aspect. Late-game battles in Like a Dragon can become frustrating due to the insta-kill abilities of some enemies, constantly forcing the party to resurrect fallen members and draining their resources. While there are ways to mitigate insta-kill attacks, such as revival items and abilities, they come with setbacks and limitations, making it difficult to effectively avoid these attacks in the game.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLight No Fire&amp;rsquo;s focus on one planet instead of a vast universe like No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky may result in a more appealing and meaningful sense of progression. The fantasy elements in Light No Fire make it potentially more engaging than No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky&amp;rsquo;s science fiction setting, allowing for more unusual and memorable experiences. While the scale of Light No Fire&amp;rsquo;s world is ambitious, maintaining a balance between quantity and quality may be a challenge for Hello Games.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe new Daidoji Agent fighting style and group battles in Like A Dragon Gaiden are well-received by players. The use of live-action video footage of real models for the cabaret segments in the game is divisive and may make some players uncomfortable. The immersive cabaret segments, while awkward, are ultimately harmless and not out of character for the game&amp;rsquo;s protagonist, Kiryu.&#xA;Literature ReviewLike A Dragon Gaiden includes the “immersive cabaret,” a divisive addition where real actresses portray hostesses who engage in flirtation for money.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLike A Dragon breaks away from typical JRPG norms by featuring mature adult protagonists instead of youthful heroes. The game&amp;rsquo;s main character, Kazuma Kiryu, is in his 50s, which is uncommon in JRPGs that often focus on younger characters. Like A Dragon stands out among other JRPGs for its focus on adults and its realistic portrayal of crime, violence, and mature themes.&#xA;Literature ReviewMost JRPGs center on teenagers or heroes in their early 20s, but Like A Dragon stands out for featuring grownups, defying the typical JRPG ageism.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGanondorf is at a weakened state in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, making him less formidable than he appears. Ganondorf&amp;rsquo;s defeat at the hands of Rauru left him severely weakened, and he seemingly hasn&amp;rsquo;t fully recovered by the end of the game. Link also has the advantages of wielding a Master Sword potentially more powerful than it&amp;rsquo;s ever been, and frequently fighting Ganondorf alongside allies.&#xA;Literature ReviewAs difficult an opponent as Ganondorf is in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, he is arguably not given a fair fight in the game.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 introduces several villains, but one villain, Chameleon, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear story arc going forward. Chameleon is revealed to be Kraven&amp;rsquo;s half-brother at the end of the &amp;ldquo;Unidentified Targets&amp;rdquo; side activities, but he is never seen or mentioned again in the story. With the focus on other villains in future Spider-Man content, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear what Chameleon&amp;rsquo;s role will be, but there is potential for an appearance in side missions or some involvement in Norman Osborn&amp;rsquo;s schemes.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Symbiote in Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 causes physical, mental, and emotional damage to the main characters, but their relatable reactions make their depictions more enjoyable. Those unfortunate enough to play host to a Symbiote have some of the most volatile aspects of their personality brought to the forefront, airing often relatable grievances. Even those who simply come in contact with the Symbiote&amp;rsquo;s hosts are frequently strained, forced to hold to their convictions despite verbal and emotional abuse.</description>

The game is likely to feature violent brawling and strong bespoke level design, showcasing a different approach than the previous Spider-Man games.&#xA;Literature ReviewMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Wolverine might not be too long in coming, which would seem like a pipe dream if not for some key evidence that supports the idea.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMary Jane Watson&amp;rsquo;s character in Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 has been set up for a future game or DLC, as she has been trained by Silver Sable and equipped with an enhanced stun gun. The Chameleon, an antagonist in the game, is still free in New York, setting him up to return in a future installment. Mary Jane&amp;rsquo;s role as an investigative journalist and her departure from the Daily Bugle make her a likely candidate to track down the Chameleon, potentially leading to an espionage-thriller storyline in a DLC or sequel.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYInsomniac Games&amp;rsquo; Spider-Man 2 takes inspiration from various media to craft its own spin on the Venom saga. In the game, the symbiotes do not have the same weaknesses as in other media. While they are still vulnerable to high-frequency sounds, they are immune to fire, which is a departure from traditional symbiote weaknesses. Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 - maybe unintentionally - introduces an additional weakness for the symbiotes: water. In gameplay, Spider-Man can throw symbiotes into lakes or rivers, instantly destroying the symbiote and freeing its host.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales missed an opportunity to expand its relatively short story with DLC. Spider-Man 2 continues to relegate Miles, a consequence of Peter being so close to Harry, Venom&amp;rsquo;s host. With Peter stepping back from superhero duties at the end of Spider-Man 2, however, Miles is perfectly poised to get the attention he deserves in potential DLC.&#xA;Literature ReviewInsomniac&amp;rsquo;s latest game, Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2, absolutely needs to redeem a notable absence from its predecessor, Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Flame&amp;rdquo; arc introduces the classic Marvel villain Carnage in his non-symbiote form, setting up a potential DLC storyline. The game&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;T-for-Teen&amp;rdquo; rating may limit the amount of violence that can be shown, which could pose a challenge when portraying the more violent and dangerous Carnage. A Venom spin-off game by Insomniac Games could provide the opportunity to have an M-rated Carnage as one of the primary villains, allowing for a more brutal and threatening portrayal.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPeter Parker relies heavily on Miles&amp;rsquo; help in Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2, to the point where Miles saves him multiple times and even helps him defeat the main villain. The future of the series suggests that Peter may be killed off, as past iterations of the comics have seen the death of Peter Parker and the rise of new Spider-Men. The ending of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 sets up a potential shift in focus, with Miles and another potential spider-person taking on the responsibility of being New York&amp;rsquo;s protectors, leaving Peter to step back temporarily.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 has improved in many ways, but the number of gadgets available has been reduced, which may disappoint fans of the previous games. The gadgets in Spider-Man 2 are better suited for combat scenarios, which may not appeal to players who prefer stealth gameplay. While abilities can be swapped around and customized, the same cannot be done with gadgets, which feels like a missed opportunity for players to tailor their gameplay experience.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewA Perk-A-Cola recipe called Death Perception can be hard to get in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies unless you obtain some rare blueprints found randomly.&#xA;Drinking a can of Death Perception allows you to spot chests, item drops, and enemies easily, even through solid walls across Urzikstan. This effect is subtle compared to other power-ups from a Perk-A-Cola in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies. Usually, you can find machines that disperse various cola flavors, but these can be hard to discover since they spawn randomly on your map.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be an iterative console, maintaining the design of the current system but adding some frills. The Switch 2 needs to address the issue of graphics capability, as the current Switch struggles to handle multi-platform releases. A successor that modestly iterates on the original would be best for this concept. The balance between home use and portability should be maintained in the Switch 2, and the price should not be raised dramatically.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYRockstar Games should have its own showcase to keep players updated on upcoming titles, similar to other major companies like PlayStation and Nintendo. A full showcase for GTA 6 would give Rockstar the opportunity to show off new features and demonstrate how it has pushed the open-world gameplay even further. A Rockstar showcase could also include updates on Red Dead Redemption 2&amp;rsquo;s current-gen upgrade and reveal updates for GTA Online or even a new GTA Online 2.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYFrontiers of Pandora introduces a refreshing gathering mechanic that goes beyond mindlessly clicking a button, adding a mini-game that requires players to consider angles and use sensory feedback. The game makes Pandora feel alive by connecting the player&amp;rsquo;s actions to the world through gathering, reflecting the film&amp;rsquo;s focus on a dynamic CGI environment. Gathering in Frontiers of Pandora matters, as the resources collected have specific uses and can be traded with the Na&amp;rsquo;vi for items, favors, and recipes.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYReturning Scratch to his owners in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is the wrong moral choice due to the abusive conditions he would be subjected to. Learning more about Scratch&amp;rsquo;s life makes it clear that protecting him from his abusive owner is the right thing to do. Keeping Scratch as a companion has gameplay benefits, such as finding hidden treasure and assisting in combat.&#xA;Literature ReviewBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 has lots of tough moral choices for the player to face throughout the game but in one case doing the wrong things is the best option.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYIn Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, having a high Armor Class (AC) can make the protagonist nearly invincible, as fewer attacks will land on them. Melee weapon users should focus more on improving their AC compared to spellcasters, as armor can interfere with spellcasting. One BG3 player managed to get their AC up to 31, making them practically invulverable to most attacks.&#xA;Literature ReviewIn BG3, taking fewer hits is always better, especially with the permadeath of Honour Mode.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChoices in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 have consequences, from sacrificing innocent lives to neglecting companions. The Origin characters in the game have dark pasts and come with baggage, like Astarion&amp;rsquo;s story of manipulation and servitude by a cruel vampire. Astarion&amp;rsquo;s fate in the game is tragic, as he can become a zombie or be used in a ritual by his former vampire master, highlighting the cruel and vindictive nature of Cazador.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOver 1.2 million players have been transformed into a cheese wheel in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3. The cheese wheel transformation does not have a significant impact on the game&amp;rsquo;s story or the ending, but it can be easily accomplished. The transformation into a wheel of cheese obscures access to one of the best weapons in the game.&#xA;Literature ReviewAmong the many secrets hidden in the world of Baldur’s Gate 3, there is a special interaction that transforms players into a sentient wheel of cheese.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYIllithid powers are an effective way to enhance a character&amp;rsquo;s abilities in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, resembling a video game skill tree. Engaging with illithid powers is a narrative choice, and avoiding them can preserve a character&amp;rsquo;s humanity but result in missed benefits. There is one exceptional illithid power that instantly kills enemies, and its effectiveness grows with more evolved illithid powers.&#xA;Literature ReviewThere are a lot of good Illithid Powers in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, but the way that one in particular scales makes it a uniquely attractive option.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMinsc and Jaheira&amp;rsquo;s experiences in prior games aren&amp;rsquo;t accounted for in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3. Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 strictly caps all playable characters&amp;rsquo; levels, meaning Minsc and Jaheira can never be as powerful as they used to be. Minsc and Jaheira&amp;rsquo;s levels may have been reset for balance and customizability, but their prior adventures are acknowledged through lore, Easter eggs, and in-game secrets.&#xA;Literature ReviewMinsc and Jaheira aren’t as powerful as they should be in Baldur’s Gate 3.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPatch 4 of Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 hints at the possibility of recruiting Minthara without committing a massacre, offering a more optimal path for players. The addition of a new scene between Minthara and Halsin provides an alternative recruitment option, avoiding the need for widespread deaths among interesting characters. While it&amp;rsquo;s uncertain if this new scene will be included in the game, its potential implementation would improve the narrative flow and address player frustration, filling a gap and rewarding those who choose mercy over violence.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPatch 5 in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 makes it easier to recruit Minthara, regardless of player alignment, making it easier to romance her as well. The easier recruitment of Minthara, however, takes away the unique draw of an evil playthrough in the game and undermines the commitment required for her story. While the change is a response to player demand, it makes Minthara feel less unique as a companion.&#xA;Literature ReviewAs of the fifth major patch for Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, one of the game&amp;rsquo;s romances has been made easier to access - and also less of a commitment.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe vastly different personalities of Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 companions create tensions but also opportunities for romance and growth. Shadowheart and Lae&amp;rsquo;zel have the most openly hostile relationship in the game, but their allegiances and personal growth can help reconcile their differences. One approach can even see the two fall into a deep romance.&#xA;Literature ReviewBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 has some particularly hostile relationships, but the right trick can quickly turn things in the opposite direction altogether.</description>

Using Autobuild with explosive barrels is an effective strategy to take down Gloom Hands quickly and without risking Link&amp;rsquo;s safety. While the strategy requires resources and preparation, the simplicity of using explosions can be highly effective against intimidating enemies in TOTK.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s Gloom Hands are threatening to face, but some clever thinking and planning can easily defeat them.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSephiroth is weaker in FF7 Rebirth compared to the original game, which adds a new dynamic to his character. Sephiroth will be playable in FF7 Rebirth, so his decrease in power makes him more balanced in gameplay. Limiting Sephiroth&amp;rsquo;s power as a playable character prevents the story and gameplay from being disrupted.&#xA;Literature ReviewSephiroth might not be the same in FF7 Rebirth, but that could be good. Here’s everything to know about the planned changes, and why they make sense.</description>

Lucia may have a young child in GTA 6 - a first for the franchise - who may only appear in cutscenes.

Engrams are created using the program Soulkiller, which can store the consciousness and memories of dying individuals. The engrams in Cyberpunk 2077 are suggested to be interpretations of data, not accurate representations of the actual person, although with developments in technology this could change.&#xA;Literature ReviewCyberpunk 2077&amp;rsquo;s story explores the idea of digital immortality through engrams, but how much of an engram is the original person, or is it just data?</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPlayers can customize their companions&amp;rsquo; camp outfits in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3. The game doesn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly mention that players can change these outfits, so it&amp;rsquo;s an easily missed mechanic. Having characters fight in camp outfits may not make logical sense, but it&amp;rsquo;s an option for those who want a different visual aesthetic.&#xA;Literature ReviewThere are many mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are not evidently explained.

      <description>SUMMARYThe trailer for GTA 6 reveals a hidden detail on the money, with &amp;ldquo;The United States of Paranoia&amp;rdquo; printed on the bills. This highlights the franchise&amp;rsquo;s cynicism toward American culture. GTA 6 continues the tradition of fictionalizing real locations, with Vice City and Leonida standing in for Miami and other parts of Florida, respectively.&#xA;Literature ReviewGrand Theft Auto is a long-running series with a lot of complications, but one detail in the GTA 6 trailer is the perfect encapsulation of it all.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 has a strong representation of fantasy races from Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, but one missing race that could add depth and flavor to the game is orcs. The absence of one race in the game presents an opportunity for future DLC to introduce this fantasy race and add more variety to the gameplay experience. While goblins are the main antagonists in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, the inclusion of this race could still provide an interesting and unique element to the game, as they have different roles and characteristics.</description>

There is a mysterious Manmade Mutant in the game, made up of various animals&amp;rsquo; parts, and evidence to suggest its creator intended to resurrect it.

      <description>SUMMARYChanges to Cryopods in ARK: Survival Ascended have been made for balance, preventing them from being overpowered like in Survival Evolved. These changes require survivors to come up with new strategies when fighting beasts or other tribes, as old tactics involving Cryopods and movement speed are no longer effective. While the changes to Cryopods and movement speed may be unpopular with some players, they are necessary for balancing the game and keeping it interesting in the long run.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYValve is notorious for never making a third game in any of its beloved series, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped the games&amp;rsquo; communities from picking up the slack. Portal 2 is set to receive Portal: Revolution, a prequel mod with a new story, puzzles, and mechanics. The mod promises a runtime of 5–8 hours, almost matching the average time it takes to beat Portal 2.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe number 3 might never appear in the title of any Valve game, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the adventure has concluded for every story.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYA mysterious and intriguing character could be the perfect final boss in a Zelda game with darker tones and an eerie style. The ability to copy Link&amp;rsquo;s skills and improved AI technology would make for a challenging and dynamic boss fight. Centering the game&amp;rsquo;s story around Link and making Dark Link the main antagonist would allow Zelda to play a more direct and significant role in supporting the hero.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSoul Coins in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can provide Karlach an extra 1d4 fire damage in combat. Using a Soul Coin consumes a bonus action, but the effects last until the next long rest, making them a valuable resource. While using Soul Coins may raise moral concerns, there are no apparent repercussions in the game, and they&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily valuable enough to be must-sell items.&#xA;Literature ReviewIt&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss or forget about some interesting advantages in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, and even minor buffs can make a big difference in the long run.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYCompanions in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can be killed or driven away through player choices in each act, providing multiple routes for losing their support. Act 1 alone has many choices that can result in the death or abandonment of several companions, limiting the party&amp;rsquo;s options for support. Act 2 and Act 3 also provide opportunities to permanently remove companions through decisions made during quests and encounters, resulting in a potential lonely journey for the player character.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYCatching new Pokémon in Pokémon GO can be exciting but recent additions appear to be more difficult to catch, which can be disappointing and take the fun out of the game. The mechanics of catch rates in Pokémon GO are complicated, with factors like Pokémon size, throwing technique, and additional modifiers affecting the capture rate. While some Pokémon should be challenging to catch, others that are low in combat power (CP) should not require excessive resources and multiple tries.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYUtilizing the Item Printer upgrade in the Indigo Disk DLC allows players to obtain an unlimited supply of Master Balls, increasing their chances of capturing powerful Legendary Pokémon. Regular play of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and its DLC can provide players with three Master Balls, but investing in the Item Printer is necessary to capture all the game&amp;rsquo;s Legendary Pokémon more easily. The Poké Ball Lotto feature in the Item Printer has a chance of producing rare Poké Balls, including the highly sought-after Master Ball.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOne of the characters in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC may have committed a crime by taking sacred water from Kitakami&amp;rsquo;s Crystal Pool without permission. The protagonist of the game does not react to the questionable morality of the Terarium Core invention, which may have been built using stolen water from the Crystal Pool. Briar, the character who potentially stole the water, faces no consequences for her actions, and it remains unclear if she will need to collect more water in the future.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPatch 1.0.2 in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria increases the drop rate of a critical resource, addressing the frustration of acquiring it. The scarcity of this crucial material hindered progression in the game, but now they can also be obtained by defeating trolls and Nameless Beasts, providing motivation for combat. The patch not only improves the availability of key resources but also includes other changes like reducing fast travel penalties and fixing bugs, showing the developers&amp;rsquo; commitment to refining the game.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThere is a need for an additional DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that could make its story even better. The Indigo Disk DLC concludes the story started in The Teal Mask, takes players on adventures away from Paldea, and explores the Terastal Phenomenon. The DLC introduces tougher Pokémon battles for advanced players and features new and returning Pokémon.&#xA;Literature ReviewEven with the release of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk expansions, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet players deserve at least one more DLC.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGrand Theft Auto 6&amp;rsquo;s trailer indicates the integration of social media platforms similar to TikTok could be a major feature within the game&amp;rsquo;s storyline and mechanics. The use of social media apps in GTA 6 could potentially unlock new missions and opportunities for players, shifting the &amp;ldquo;Strangers and Freaks&amp;rdquo; missions to social media interactions. Social media could play a larger role in GTA 6 by satirizing true crime media and allowing players to shape their characters&amp;rsquo; reputation through online videos, potentially influencing the behavior of NPCs in the game.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom introduces fascinating new lore about the Rito. Penn, a character in Tears of the Kingdom, possesses the ability to communicate with birds, suggesting that all Rito may have this extraordinary skill. This has serious implications for the intelligence of all wildlife in Hyrule, corroborated by Wolf Link having similar abilities in Twilight Princess.&#xA;Literature ReviewPenn displays an interesting ability in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which carries dramatic implications for the rest of the Rito.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYA frustrating mechanic in Starfield limits wealth accumulation and progression in the game. Resting for a couple of days can refresh vendor credits, but it&amp;rsquo;s not an ideal solution. A mod called Richer Merchants can fix the issue by giving vendors more credits and goods, streamlining the accumulation of wealth.&#xA;Literature ReviewGaining money in Starfield isn&amp;rsquo;t all that hard, but one mechanic makes earning credits tedious &amp;amp; annoying and could be altered pretty easily.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYModern Warfare 3 has had a rough release due to a lackluster campaign, bugs, and issues, especially with the PC version, resulting in refund requests. The use of the Call of Duty HQ launcher poses a problem for Steam&amp;rsquo;s refund system, as it includes playtime from MW2 and Warzone, making it harder to qualify for a refund. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to get a refund for MW3 by contacting Steam Support directly, a better solution would be for Call of Duty to change how it launches its games.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYFlorian&amp;rsquo;s design in Super Mario Bros. Wonder reflects his role as the prince of the Flower Kingdom, and some fans were concerned about a potential connection to the obscure Mario anime film, The Great Mission To Rescue Princess Peach. The 1986 anime film introduced the character Kibidango, who is revealed to be the true form of Prince Haru of the Flower Kingdom. Nintendo has kept its film adaptations separate from its games, and it is unlikely that Florian&amp;rsquo;s design in Super Mario Bros.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe evil path in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is limited due to the trajectory of the story, making it impossible to fully commit to the dark path. Joining forces with Ketheric Thorm, the leader of the Absolute&amp;rsquo;s army, is not possible, as the encounter ultimately goes haywire and leads to a boss fight. While there are other options to serve the goals of the enemy, no major outcome in the game revolves around serving the Absolute.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDespite its successful launch, players are beginning to notice small inconsistencies and issues in Starfield that negatively impact the game&amp;rsquo;s immersion. The New Atlantis Transit system in Starfield&amp;rsquo;s largest city is especially peculiar, failing to be convincing under scrutiny. These issues with Starfield may simply be carrying over from earlier Bethesda games, suggesting the studio&amp;rsquo;s formula is growing dated.&#xA;Literature ReviewNow that Starfield has gotten some distance from its launch date, players are finding tiny peculiarities with the game that can sour the experience.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPlaying as a Dark Urge character in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can limit branching possibilities in the game, including missing out on fantastic gear. One such item that can become unobtainable is the Potent Robe, which is a valuable item for casters. Certain Dark Urge actions are unavoidable, but very specific actions can be taken to ensure the Potent Robe isn&amp;rsquo;t barred from being acquired.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Dark Urge can easily derail a Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 campaign with even the best of intentions, and one moment makes this more obvious than any other.</description>

One character in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can provide major assistance to players, like changing the class of a character for a nominal fee of 100 gold. Respeccing party members in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can completely change the dynamics of the game, allowing players to build a party around personalities and customize it to work as an effective unit.</description>

The armor&amp;rsquo;s design suggests a connection to the extinct Zonai race, but certain features like a tail and green skin resemble the Gerudo, particularly Ganondorf and Twinrova. It is speculated that the Ancient Hero may be related to Koume and Kotake, potentially as a failed attempt at resurrecting Ganondorf, or as an instrument of revenge against Hyrule by Twinrova using Zonai DNA.</description>

The githyanki prince Orpheus is a crucial character in the game&amp;rsquo;s plot and can be easily missed if certain conditions aren&amp;rsquo;t met.

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThere are several bosses in Persona 5 Tactica, the second of which is Yoshiki. Uniquely, this boss hangs back and makes the party come to him.&#xA;Whereas Marie took on the party headfirst, Yoshiki will hang back initially in each phase and let other enemies engage the party first. Conserving SP is going to be imperative early on, as players will have to utilize the same three party members for the duration of all three phases of this fight.</description>

His kit revolves around last-hitting enemies to generate Moxie for his powerful Ultimate.&#xA;The main goal with A Knight&amp;rsquo;s play style is to get enough moxie and weaken the enemies enough to where After AD 778 can kill them and give the team Rousing Morale, which boosts their next Attack DMG by 50%. If his other Incantations, Justice and Glory, are fully leveled up, A Knight can get his Ultimate ready after using both Incantations once, wiping out the field in a single round.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewBkornblume is an excellent DPS support in Reverse 1999. She focuses on opening enemies up to extra Reality DMG and requires niche team comps.&#xA;Part of Bkornblume&amp;rsquo;s appeal is her simple play style. She weakens the field and leaves it open to those with Reality-based attacks to pick them off. This restricts her to Reality-centric teams, but since some of the best DPS and survival-oriented characters also deal with Reality DMG, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a major downside.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewCenturion may be the best DPS character in all of Reverse 1999. Her kit plays with her Moxie and decimates enemies with her Reality-based attacks.&#xA;Most of the time, Centurion only targets one or two enemies at a time. Outdoor Superstar is a two-person attack that bestows extra Moxie in the higher levels. Victorious General, meanwhile, is a single-enemy attack that gets a DMG bonus based on Centurion&amp;rsquo;s available Moxie.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewCharlie is a performer in Reverse: 1999 who makes a show of her oddly balanced HP to boost her DMG with excellent buffs for every occasion.&#xA;Charlie is a 5-star character with a Star Afflatus, making her Portrays easier to collect. Her Incantations have two different bonuses. If she casts Tempest To Thee! with less than 50% HP, she deals up to 150% more Mental DMG. When she casts Thunder To Thee!</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewDikke acts as both a F2P healer and sub-DPS in Reverse 1999. If you want to use her, build her like a DPS and have her teammates cover utilities.&#xA;Dikke is a 5-Star Beast character who deals Mental DMG. Since her healing is based on her ATK, she needs to build similar to any other DPS unit. That means pairing her with a Psychube that provides a good ATK bonus and improves the effectiveness of her attacks.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewDruvis III is a main DPS from Reverse: 1999 who applies Petrify to enemies, rendering them unable to act as she deals Mental DMG against them.&#xA;Druvis III&amp;rsquo;s best build involves a full-Plant Afflatus, a full Mental-DMG team, and a Psychube that boosts her DMG. Her strict team requirements can make her hard to support, but if you want a team that prevents enemies from acting throughout combat, Druvis III is your girl.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewEternity is a main DPS in Reverse 1999 who loses HP whenever she casts an Incantation. However, she is a shockingly sturdy and reliable DPS.&#xA;At Insight One, Eternity is immune to Blood, Poison, and Corrode statuses. At the start of a round, she gets a stack of Blood of Longevity, boosting her DMG Dealt and DMG Heal. This immunity, along with her debuff Incantation and steady DMG potential, makes her an excellent match for teams with steady healers, weak enemy bonuses, and debuff perks.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewLilya has some of the best critical stats in Reverse: 1999, but she can be a tough-to-build main DPS thanks to her strict Psychube and team choices.&#xA;Lilya cannot convert her excess Crit Rate into Crit DMG, so players must be careful how much they invest in Crit Rate. However, if she can have teammates that reduce the enemy&amp;rsquo;s critical resistance, Lilya can swoop in and knock their lights out.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewMedicine Pocket is the best healer in Reverse: 1999, but the right healing Psychubes and powerful team comps can make them even better.&#xA;Medicine Pocket is a non-binary character who uses they/them pronouns. This is a rare treat for gacha game fans, as Chinese game studios (the main producers of gacha games) typically avoid canonical LGBTQ+ characters in their gacha lineups.&#xA;If you want to increase Medicine Pocket&amp;rsquo;s healing potential, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a sturdy healing Psychube to boost their ATK while supplying extra healing.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewMelania is one the best DPS characters in Reverse: 1999 and can deal immense damage to a single target. Teammates should support her strength.&#xA;Melania specializes in burst damage and can ramp up with each subsequent use of her Ultimate, Ridiculous Eyewitness Testimony.

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewRegulus is a high-ranking and unique main DPS in Reverse: 1999, as she gets a powerful critical bonus when she remains inactive for a full round.&#xA;Regulus is a Star Arcanist who deals Mental DMG. Her build revolves around Restless Heart and its ability to deal consistent critical hits. Because she needs to spend every other round inactive, she needs a team with strong secondary DPS characters.

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewSonetto may be F2P, but she is one of the best support characters in Reverse 1999 with excellent DPS and buff capabilities, fitting many team comps.&#xA;While F2P characters are typically weak, Sonetto is one of the best characters in Reverse 1999 as of global launch. While she may struggle in boss battles, her Incantations make her a top-tier support character. She can prevent strong enemies from attacking while boosting her team&amp;rsquo;s damage, leading to a powerful Ultimate against all enemies.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewTennant is the best shielder in Reverse: 1999, coming in strong with sub-DPS skills unique to survival characters. She focuses on Reality DMG teams.&#xA;Tennant can be quite AP-greedy as she gains enough Moxie for her Ultimate and then takes advantage of its special status, Diamond Bullet, for two more actions. When she spends a stack of Diamond Bullet to attack an enemy, that enemy gets a Reality DEF debuff, opening them to more Reality attacks.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewVoyager is a beautiful violinist in Reverse 1999 whose build centers around controlling the battlefield with debuffs and constant activity.&#xA;Voyager&amp;rsquo;s Insight One is highly useful, as after three actions, she gets Chorus Ensemble. With this status, if an enemy takes action after Voyager acts, she gives all enemies a round of Silence, which prevents them from buffing, debuffing, countering, or healing. If she gets to Insight Three, she also inflicts Seal during Chorus Ensemble, so enemies can&amp;rsquo;t use their Ultimates.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewX is a solid dispeller and crowd controller character in Reverse 1999. His best builds play on his debuffs and encourage teams that weaken enemies.&#xA;X is a 5-Star Intellect character who works well in boss battles and rarely experiences a negative Afflatus effect due to the rarity of the Intellect Afflatus.&#xA;X takes some time to build, as the debuffs in his Incantations don&amp;rsquo;t apply until you start leveling them up.</description>

NG+ offers a ton of new content, making it a more enjoyable experience with additional challenges when players haven&amp;rsquo;t already completed everything. For multiple playthroughs, players should prioritize the campaign on the first run, focus on side content on the second and third runs, and experiment with the galaxy sandbox in subsequent NG+ runs.</description>

Most planets in Starfield don&amp;rsquo;t have lush green landscapes or diverse biomes, as the game focuses on a sense of realism in establishing its setting.

      <description>SUMMARYStarfield&amp;rsquo;s lack of a Game of the Year nomination at The Game Awards for 2023 indicates that Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s open-world formula may not be evolving enough to keep up with the competition. Despite its immense scale and highly anticipated release, Starfield has failed to make a significant impact on the industry and has been overshadowed by other games in categories outside of &amp;ldquo;Best RPG.&amp;rdquo; Starfield&amp;rsquo;s gameplay, while ambitious, has not improved enough from previous Bethesda games, making it potentially tedious to play and lacking in refined and compelling gameplay loops compared to other open-world games.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYStarfield&amp;rsquo;s vast interplanetary scale comes with compromises like repetitive, procedurally generated planets and generic design elements. Starfield&amp;rsquo;s faction system should be improved by taking inspiration from titles like Fallout: New Vegas, which explored the rifts between factions in a deeper and more consequential way. Shattered Space, the upcoming DLC for Starfield, has the potential to address the game&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings by introducing divisions among factions, more companion diversity, and branching paths for different endings.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYStarfield&amp;rsquo;s new game plus mechanic is intriguing and fits well with its world, but it lacks depth and falls short of creating a compelling gameplay experience. While the addition of new game plus in Starfield showcases Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s desire to evolve, it may not be necessary for future games like The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5, given the established lore of these franchises. A new game plus feature in Bethesda games, although interesting, goes against the unique qualities and enjoyment of exploration and role-playing across multiple playthroughs that players traditionally experience in these games.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria focuses more on rebuilding existing structures rather than starting from scratch, limiting the full potential of base building. The game could improve by emphasizing starting bases from scratch, as early sections have limited open areas for building and can give the impression that broken structures are the only suitable places for bases. Despite its flaws, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has the potential to become a great survival crafting game with updates and support from the modding community.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewParties in Star Ocean The Second Story R have strengths and weaknesses.

Many are gained by leveling up. But, others are obtained via side quests or through the complex crafting system. If you are utilizing the latter, then you might also need plenty of extra FOL currency for raw materials.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewFarming XP in Modern Warfare 3 Zombies is different from past titles, with the massive map providing new ways to best defeat waves of undead hordes.&#xA;One of the easiest ways to earn experience fast comes from expending a Double XP Token, a reward for playing matches in Modern Warfare 3&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer. The boost this Token provides only lasts for a limited time, so use it wisely. It&amp;rsquo;s always better to farm XP with a squad than alone since your rewards are usually increased if you play with more people.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Finals&amp;rsquo; Battle Pass is time-consuming and requires players to invest exorbitant amounts of time to complete it. Battle passes in online games can make the experience feel like an obligation rather than a joy, limiting players&amp;rsquo; exploration of other games and hindering the growth of alternative options. Other games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Halo Infinite have implemented more player-friendly battle pass systems, offering quality-of-life benefits and better rewards, setting a standard for what battle passes should be.</description>

The Lost Levels are the perfect addition for a rerelease, and would be great bonus content for other remasters as well.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered has a variety of new content compared to the original release, but one new addition in particular is fascinating.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Last of Us Part 2 is a brutally violent game that explores the consequences of revenge and cyclical violence. Ellie is unable to find closure regarding Joel&amp;rsquo;s death, and mistakenly believes revenge is the only means to accomplish it. Ellie&amp;rsquo;s actions at the end of TLOU 2 are difficult to understand, but they stem from the series&amp;rsquo; ideas on found families and the capacity for forgiving the unforgivable.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Zelda series has met with a lot of success recently, but there&amp;rsquo;s little news about what&amp;rsquo;s next. 2024 could be the first year in recent memory without a Zelda release, breaking a trend of almost yearly releases that has characterized the franchise in recent years. Rumors suggest that Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remasters could be released for the Switch in 2024. The focus on a live-action movie adaptation may also be delaying the next Zelda game&amp;rsquo;s development.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe aliens encountered in Majora&amp;rsquo;s Mask, known as Them, are based on a real-life encounter with the Flatwoods Monster in West Virginia. The design decision to include aliens in Majora&amp;rsquo;s Mask was inspired by a UFO boom in Japan at the time of development. The Them encounter at Romani Ranch is one of the most memorable moments in Majora&amp;rsquo;s Mask, and the monsters are among the most mysterious enemies in The Legend of Zelda.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been rated by the ESRB. Although there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a definitive release date announced yet, Nintendo games typically get rated by the ESRB only months before they launch. As a remake of a classic Mario RPG, Paper Mario: TTYD may be one of the Switch&amp;rsquo;s last major releases before Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s new console is released.&#xA;Literature ReviewAlthough the exact release date of the Paper Mario: TTYD remake has yet to be announced, one piece of evidence suggests it&amp;rsquo;s releasing early in 2024.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Legend of Zelda&amp;rsquo;s next game is highly anticipated, but details about its gameplay and appearance are still unknown, as the game hasn&amp;rsquo;t even been confirmed to be in development. Link, the iconic hero of the series, has had very little character change throughout its history, except for a change in outfit and, oddly, his dominant hand. Link&amp;rsquo;s original left-handedness in the early 3D era of the series was a unique detail, and it would be a nice homage if it were to make a comeback in the next installment.</description>

A new Hyrule in future Zelda games means new characters and a fresh story, saying farewell to the current version of Link. The absence of planned DLC for Tears of the Kingdom suggests that the developers consider the game complete and ready to move on to a new chapter.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe next Legend of Zelda game should bring back the traditional mechanic of playing a musical instrument, which has been absent in recent titles. Music is a key aspect of the Zelda franchise, with Link often having powerful instruments that allow him to perform magical songs. Implementing motion controls for playing an instrument in the next Zelda game on the Switch could offer new and exciting possibilities for gameplay.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewRemoving a Villager in LEGO Fortnite is fairly easy, but players should first consider other options to unlock more settlement space for new friends.&#xA;Before you send any of your Villagers away, you may want to upgrade your LEGO Fortnite Village instead. You unlock slots for more Villagers as you upgrade, and a fully upgraded Village can house five Villagers. As such, it may be worth checking whether any of your settlements have room before deciding to remove someone.</description>

The DLC could transform the expansion into a third-person stealth shooter, similar to The Last of Us. This expansion could set the stage for future DLCs involving other characters like Daredevil.&#xA;Literature ReviewThere are many possibilities when it comes to a DLC for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but the best one would completely change the game and story.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLeaks claim that Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed Codename Red will feature a protagonist based on the real historical figure of Yasuke. Yasuke&amp;rsquo;s backstory in the game may take some creative license, potentially making it inaccurate. His role in Japan&amp;rsquo;s Sengoku period is well-documented. Yasuke fought alongside Oda Nobunaga and rose to the rank of samurai, but his true story ends with Nobunaga&amp;rsquo;s death and his own disappearance from history.&#xA;Literature ReviewRumor has it the protagonist of Assassin’s Creed Red will be based on the historical figure of Yasuke, a Black samurai in Oda Nobunaga’s army.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Trust: A Game Of Greed falls short compared to reality TV favorites like The Traitors and Big Brother. The gameplay in The Trust lacks strategic depth and contestants can simply choose to share the prize money. The character development in The Trust is lacking, making it difficult to invest in any of the contestants and their stories feel contrived.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Trust: A Game Of Greed is a cross between The Traitors and Big Brother, but it can&amp;rsquo;t match the best reality TV shows.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Legend of Zelda&amp;rsquo;s timeline is notoriously convoluted, and Tears of the Kingdom seems to contradict many aspects of it. Certain characters and events in Tears of the Kingdom make it impossible to reconcile it with the existing franchise timeline. It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely there will ever be an update to the official Zelda timeline, simply because TOTK has made it too confusing.&#xA;Literature ReviewIt seems impossible to place The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the franchise’s official timeline, vastly complicating any future updates.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDave the Diver, developed by Nexon, is an excellent expamle of why The Game Awards needs to redefine &amp;ldquo;indie games.&amp;rdquo; The definition of &amp;ldquo;Indie Games&amp;rdquo; has become fuzzier, with many people mistakenly assuming that unique gameplay and affordable prices automatically classify a game as indie. However, real indie games are made by small teams or individuals without the support of a big studio like Nexon. Dave the Diver&amp;rsquo;s nomination for Best Indie Game is unfair to other nominees in the category and overlooks true indie games.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOrigin characters offer a range of personalities, making them appealing to different players, but custom characters are a safer option. It&amp;rsquo;s better to replay Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 with an Origin character after experiencing them as a party member, to fully explore their interactions and roleplay them effectively. Because of this, choosing a favorite Origin character in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 might not be the best choice, as playing as them sacrifices their dialogue and personality.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYTaming a Gigantopithecus in Ark: Survival Ascended is a potentially huge advantage due to its versatility and strength. The Gigantopithecus can toss humans and carry heavy loads, making it an efficient resource mover. Its humanoid shape allows it to use ziplines, equip any helmet, gather resources, and navigate challenging terrains.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Gigantopithecus has some strong general utility in Ark: Survival Ascended, but one specific advantage gives it a special edge over any alternative</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe recently released epilogue, Mochi Mayhem, extends the adventure and introduces a Mythical Pokémon, but it can only be accessed through a presumably limited-time Mystery Gift. Tying the DLC epilogue to a time-sensitive delivery method is a mistake, as it limits the availability of significant story content and feels exploitative. It&amp;rsquo;s currently unclear if the epilogue Mystery Gift will be permanently available, if some other method of accessing it will be introduced, or if it will eventually become lost media.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe possibility that the Zonai may not have founded the original Hyrule presents intriguing implications for the entire Legend of Zelda series. The existence of an additional incarnation of Hyrule would explain some peculiar details in Tears of the Kingdom, such as changes in Hyrule&amp;rsquo;s religion and the connection between the Ancient Sages and Divine Beasts. The concept of a cycle of destruction and rebuilding fits well with the story of Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s rebuilding efforts align with the idea of Hyrule being continually re-established after such events.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGrand Theft Auto 6 will probably not have an advanced weather system, which may disappoint players who were expecting immersive weather effects. The decision to abandon advanced weather plans might be due to technical limitations, as creating realistic extreme weather conditions would require significant processing power. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like GTA 6 will have groundbreaking weather, it is likely to build upon the weather improvements seen in GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, including the use of ray-tracing technology for enhanced lighting effects.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewSolving today&amp;rsquo;s Wordle shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult for most fans of the game but if help is needed, we&amp;rsquo;ve got the daily hints and fully spoiled answer.&#xA;For those that do enjoy more of a challenge, Wordle does provide a Hard Mode which can be turned on before any game. This will lock in correct letters and clues by forcing you to use them in future guesses. Doing this will remove the ability to do starting Wordle word combos that may provide a lot of letters in only two guesses.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewDecember 2nd’s Wordle answer has a repeating letter and a very complex spelling that will throw off many players.&#xA;To solve answers with repeating letters, it is recommended to use Wordle’s hard mode to prevent the usage of random guesses. While this mode cannot tell if there are any repeating letters, its mechanics will prevent you from reusing confirmed letters in different spots. However, you can still find it challenging to solve the puzzle if you aren’t careful, but perhaps using some hints might help.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewDecember 20th’s Wordle answer contains a repeating letter, which might cause many players to lose their streaks if they don’t use hints.&#xA;To circumvent this, you can use Wordle’s hard mode, which is the best way to solve answers with repeating letters. Since this mode locks the correct positions of letters, you will be forced to use those letters in the same spots in your consequent guesses. This will remove the risk of using random guesses, which usually causes most players to lose their daily streak.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewDecember 21st’s Wordle answer could cause some player to lose their daily streak if they like to take chances with random attempts.&#xA;You can also use Wordle’s hard mode so that you don’t get carried away by using random words. As this mode won’t let you reuse confirmed letters in other spots, the chances of losing your daily streak are significantly reduced.

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewDecember 22nd’s Wordle answer can be solved in about four attempts if players use words with multiple vowels in their first few attempts.&#xA;If you always use random words in your first few attempts, it might be time to switch to Wordle’s hard mode. Using random words often leads to players using their daily streaks, and this mode comes in handy to prevent such situations. The harder mode locks in the correct position of confirmed letters, meaning you will be forced to use those letters in the same spot.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewSolving November 9th’s Wordle answer shouldn’t be too much trouble if players use contextual hints that give a fair idea of the solution.&#xA;Many players tend to get carried away when using random words in the hopes of discovering the correct position of a few letters. This strategy might work in the first few attempts but isn’t helpful in the long run. However, if you use Wordle’s hard mode, you have a better chance of solving the puzzle without sacrificing your daily streak.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYTOTK&amp;rsquo;s greatest aspect is its worldbuilding, introducing the Zonai and expanding the lore of the Zelda series, which will have a lasting impact on future titles. The game&amp;rsquo;s extensive world and Link&amp;rsquo;s abilities make for an entertaining experience, with the potential for new tools and weapons inspired by Zonai technology in future games. The expanding world of Zelda allows for innovative changes in art styles, game mechanics, and world designs, making it possible for the next game to be radically different from TOTK but still incorporate its worldbuilding.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe funniest character from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could potentially become the perfect villain in the next Zelda title. The Yiga Clan&amp;rsquo;s Master Kohga, known for his comedic antics, could pose a major threat to Hyrule and potentially resurrect Ganon. The return of Ganon or Ganondorf is inevitable in the Zelda series, and a game centered around preventing his resurrection with the help of Kohga and the Yiga Clan would be an excellent plot to pursue.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYRomance is a key part of Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always involve the player. Haarlep, who serves as a body double for Raphael, wears lingerie with a lecherous inscription written on it. Haarlep&amp;rsquo;s presence in Raphael&amp;rsquo;s boudoir suggests they are Raphael&amp;rsquo;s lover, taking on different forms based on his preferences and intensifying his narcissism.&#xA;Literature ReviewRomance is part and parcel of the Baldur’s Gate 3 experience, but one character takes it way too far.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Finals, developed by veteran Battlefield developers at Embark Studios, offers familiar gameplay mechanics that resemble the classic Battlefield experience, but with a unique twist. The game emphasizes squad-based tactics and coordination, making it a potential substitute for Battlefield 2042, which has been criticized for its reliance on Specialist characters and lack of squad organization. The Finals stands out with its impressive server-side destruction feature, which adds an innovative and ever-present dimension to matches and firefights, and has been a long-standing request from Battlefield fans.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewUnpacking constructs a beautiful narrative by using the main character&amp;rsquo;s belongings to reflect life changes as players unpack them year after year.&#xA;Unpacking&amp;rsquo;s story spans 21 years and consists of eight levels, starting with the main character’s childhood bedroom and progressing through each new home she moves into throughout her life. Players of this chill indie title are given a lot of flexibility as to how they want to arrange her home, and much of the narrative is told through subtle restrictions as to where specific sentimental items can be placed, which creates an impactful gameplay narrative with very limited text.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 has a wide variety of magical abilities, but not every one always works as expected, adding amusement to the game. The Wild Shape feature of druids in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 can lead to comical and awkward interactions in cutscenes, affecting immersion and gameplay. Despite the issues, Wild Shape is still a great feature in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, providing unique gameplay experiences.&#xA;Literature ReviewMagic offers a lot of opportunities in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3, but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the unintended side effects that prove to be the most memorable.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThe cult leader Chaos Marine Aurora is one of the first and more difficult bosses you face in Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader toward the end of Chapter 1.&#xA;Chaos Marine Aurora has 320 Hit Points, 60% Armor, and 83% dodge with 12 Movement Points, which gives her excellent defenses and great mobility. Aurora&amp;rsquo;s characteristics are all very high as well when you check her stats.

      <description>SUMMARYOne playable character in Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man 2 is a major disappointment, lacking in fun and agency.

      <description>SUMMARYStarfield&amp;rsquo;s release has been plagued with bugs and oversights, which are compounded by the game&amp;rsquo;s slow update schedule and lack of major patches. Bethesda RPGs, including Starfield, have a reputation for being buggy upon release, but the minimal post-launch support for Starfield is notable compared to past games like Skyrim and Fallout 4. The game is lacking in quality-of-life features and may not have DLC releases in as timely a manner due to its larger scope and seemingly slower update schedule.</description>

However, enemy players can also disrupt your boss fight.&#xA;To find Krampus, you will need to land directly south of Hazy Hillside, one of the best landing spots in Fortnite this season. Unlike other NPC bosses in the game, Krampus is rather popular. As such, if you aim to complete your Winterfest quests, it’s highly recommended that you beeline straight for his location and land early.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChoosing a specific lifepath in Cyberpunk 2077 doesn&amp;rsquo;t dramatically impact gameplay or major aspects of the game, but it adds unique flavor to the character with different prologues, dialogue options, and side missions. The Nomad lifepath, with its high-octane and disorienting intro sequence, is the most approachable option for newcomers as it offers combat experience and helps players grasp the game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. The Street Kid lifepath is perhaps the most immersive, creating a smooth transition between V&amp;rsquo;s backstory and the gameplay that sees them become one of Night City&amp;rsquo;s most prominent edgerunners.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Origin characters in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 should be higher levels based on their backstories and abilities before the game&amp;rsquo;s events. The in-game explanation for their low starting levels is that the mind flayer parasites or other factors caused their power downgrade. Gale and Wyll&amp;rsquo;s levels can be roughly determined, but it takes more guesswork to figure out the other Origins&amp;rsquo; levels prior to the game.&#xA;Literature ReviewBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&amp;rsquo;s Origin characters level up alongside the player, but them start at level one doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense considering their backstories.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBaldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is based on Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5e but has a maximum level of 12, not the tabletop RPG&amp;rsquo;s maximum level of 20. Expansion of the level cap is unlikely. Higher-level spells and stronger villains in late-game DnD make it challenging to continue Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 past level 12 in a video game format. Increasing the level cap would lengthen the game and require extensive planning and development, making it difficult to create an expansion for Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 in the future.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSilent Hill: Ascension falls short in its attempt to revive the series, lacking the depth and mystique of the classic Silent Hill titles. The interactive element of Ascension, where viewers can vote on the story&amp;rsquo;s path, is marred by a voting system that favors those willing to spend money. While Ascension was a disappointment, there is still hope for the series with the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, which can learn from Ascension&amp;rsquo;s mistakes and deliver a true revival.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGoat Simulator 3 is a sequel to the original Goat Simulator, but what happened to Goat Simulator 2? More and more people are playing the 2022 release thanks to its recent addition to Xbox Game Pass - which means even more players are confused about its title.

      <description>SUMMARYFollowing the conclusion of the 2023 season, two-thirds of Overwatch League teams elected to depart from the league, prompting Activision Blizzard to transition away from the current model. Activision Blizzard will pay nearly $120 million to the 20 contracted teams as they move towards founding a new framework for competitive Overwatch play. The closure of the Overwatch League was not surprising given Activision Blizzard&amp;rsquo;s overestimated ambitions, financial burdens, and the impact of a gender discrimination scandal that led to sponsors cutting ties and a decline in fan interest.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe level cap in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 is set at Level 12, which can be disappointing if reached early and XP becomes meaningless. The Level 30 mod allows players to go beyond the level cap, adding unique paths, feats, spell slots, and passive abilities. Leveling up to 30 is achieved by opening up more slots across classes and requires tweaks to progression, with increased XP gains and combat experience.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAnimating spores is one of the most powerful spells in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3. The spell can be cast at any time, in and out of battle, without using a spell slot, but it only works on certain targets accessible during a specific quest in Act Two. While there are alternative spells with similar effects, neither are as effective as Animating Spores, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to make the most of it while the opportunity arises.</description>

As a Charisma-focused class, Bards synergize best with other Charisma-focused classes such as the Paladin, Sorcerer, and Warlock.

      <description>SUMMARYDiablo 4 introduces the Abattoir of Zir event, a challenging gameplay experience that addresses complaints about the game being too easy. With 25 tiers of increasing difficulty, it will be an incredibly tough challenge for players. The Abattoir of Zir focuses on scaling enemy health rather than damage, making it difficult to progress. Even the most optimized character builds in Diablo 4 are expected to struggle. While no character may be able to finish the event upon its release, those who can successfully take on Nightmare Dungeon Tier 100&amp;rsquo;s elite enemies should have a chance.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&#xA;Literature ReviewThere are hundreds of Fuse materials available in Tears of the Kingdom. Some are better for beginners while others are used best with endgame items.&#xA;Keep in mind that not every Fuse item should be paired with weapons in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Ingredient materials such as Chuchu Jelly are wasted on melee tools, but are best used as attachments for Link&amp;rsquo;s many arrows. The two most important aspects of a Fuse material are how easy it is to find in the massive open-world, and the potential strength it can bring when infused into other items.</description>

This horse has an incredible design and is never used anywhere else in the game, and could&amp;rsquo;ve been part of a fun boss fight or part of a quest.&#xA;Literature ReviewDisappointingly, the coolest horse that can be seen in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also thoroughly wasted by the game.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom seemingly includes a plot hole pertaining to the series&amp;rsquo; established canon regarding its central, recurring conflict. Despite drawing heavily on the wider Zelda franchise, TOTK only features one version of Link; a hero does not emerge to help Rauru, Zelda, and the Sages seal Ganondorf in the past. There are a few different possible explanations for such a plot hole, but the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide enough context to definitively explain the situation.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe final boss battle in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is impressive, but it does not live up to expectations set by the game.

Fans speculate that this many have been Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s original intention, but were limited by the Switch&amp;rsquo;s hardware.&#xA;Literature ReviewTears of the Kingdom seems to promise an outstanding final battle; while the final boss is undoubtedly astounding, it’s not quite what was set up.</description>
