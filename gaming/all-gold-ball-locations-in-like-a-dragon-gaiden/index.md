 Where To Find All 7 Gold Balls 
          

Some Gold Balls are simply stumbled upon throughout Sotenbori and Castle, while others must be won or paid for. Nonetheless, if you plan on acquiring all seven, you will need to know how to earn money fast in Like A Dragon Gaiden.



 Gold Ball #1 Location 
          

The first Gold Ball in Like A Dragon Gaiden is relatively easy to obtain. Unfortunately, however, it will most likely drain your bank account. The first Gold Ball can be purchased from Akame&#39;s Shop for 777 Akame Points.




If you don&#39;t already have Akame&#39;s Shop unlocked, you will need to spend 15,000 to do so. Following that, you will need to invest twice, costing ¥80,000 and ¥150,000, respectively. After you&#39;ve upgraded the shop twice, the Gold Ball will be available for purchase in her inventory.



 Gold Ball #2 Location 
          

The second Gold Ball is the easiest to acquire. You can simply buy it for ¥77,777 at the Ebisu Pawn Shop on E. Shofukucho street.



 Gold Ball #3 Location 
          

To obtain the Shofukucho store sign Gold Ball, you must first accept the Stroll n&#39; Patrol quest &#34;Solve the Mysterious Note&#34; from the young man sitting on a bench on the Northside of the Sotenbori Footpath.






You can only find this NPC in the morning and after you have completed Chapter 4.




After speaking to the man, he will note that you&#39;re looking for four turtle pillars, which will lead you to the Gold Ball. These turtle pillars are located near W Shofukucho Street. The Gold Ball sits on top of a store sign directly across from them.



 Gold Ball #4 Location 
          

The fourth Gold Ball in Like A Dragon Gaiden is a swift and awkward snatch-and-grab. If you walk down to the W Sotenbori Footpath, you will notice a yellow boat that frequently passes by on the river. A man in a speedo will be at the boat&#39;s bow, with the Gold Ball in a controversial location. Use your Spider Gadget to snatch the Gold Ball from the man as the boat goes by.






The boat only comes and goes during the day, not at night. Furthermore, the Speedo Man with the Gold Ball won&#39;t always spawn on the boat.






 Gold Ball #5 Location 
          

You can find the Kiss Shot Billiards &amp; Bar in the lower-left corner of the map. Head inside and talk to the employee to learn you can earn billiard points in the bar&#39;s prize shop. One of the goods is a Gold Ball, which costs 777 billiard points. So, all you have to do is play pool games until you&#39;ve earned enough money to buy the Gold Ball.



 Gold Ball #6 Location 
          




The second to last Gold Ball is another crotch-n-grab. This time, make your way to the Castle, enter the Casino, and hug the left side. Dancers can be seen moving about on a conveyor belt from the guard rail, and one in the back has a tiny Gold Ball dangling from their crotch. When you&#39;re close enough and see the prompt on your screen, grab the ball with your Spider Gadget.



 Gold Ball #7 Location 
          

The final Gold Ball in Like A Dragon Gaiden is another crotch one, but this time from the underside of a giant bronze statue. You can find this big bronze statue of a man just below the fighter&#39;s lounge area in the Castle. It&#39;s pretty easy to spot, and once you do, look at where the jewels would be, and you will find the Gold Ball.



If you&#39;re having trouble locating a particular Gold Ball, refer to deveillion7 on YouTube to help show you its exact location.

 
 









 &#34;Gotta Catch ‘em Balls!&#34; Quest Reward 
          

After you have successfully obtained all seven Gold Balls, inform Akame. She will instruct you to meet with her client, Shen-san, who is waiting for you in a back alley on East Sotenbori Street. Once you locate Shen and give him the seven Gold Balls, he&#39;ll let you choose from one of four wishes. These wishes come in the form of dialogue options. However, some answers do result in monetary rewards.

 Wish Choices  Reward   &#34;I Wish for a Peaceful Life&#34;  Shen does not give a reward for this option, instead directing you back to the other choices.   &#34;I Wish for Eternal Life&#34;  You receive 100 Nourishment of the Sea King health items.   &#34;I Wish for Endless Riches&#34;  Shen gives you 1,000,000 Yen.   &#34;I Wish for Sexy Panties&#34;  You receive the Shen-san Panties item, which sells for 1,500,000 Yen at the nearby Pawn Shop.   






Finding all seven Gold Balls is a chore, but it&#39;s entirely worth it for the rewards you get as part of your wish. Because these could very well be the best rewards in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
