## Literature Review

One of the least-developed characters in Baldur’s Gate 3 just got a lot more interesting with the revelation of a secret dialogue option.




A newly noticed hidden dialogue in Baldur’s Gate 3 helps players delve deeper into one of the main character’s daddy issues. The award-winning RPG by Larian Studios was critically acclaimed due to its depth, both in terms of gameplay mechanics but also its branching narrative and sense of freedom when making choices. Many of these important decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 are directly connected to the companions that venture alongside the player’s custom character, should they have created their hero or villain instead of using an origin character. Creating a custom character is the best way of getting to know these companions, should the player’s decisions not drive them away.




Depending on the evil deeds caused by the player, some characters that are more morally aligned to righteousness may actually leave the player, shutting them away from their storyline. One such hero is Karlach, who disapproves of attacking the Emerald Grove. Similarly, if players are too good, they may miss some other questlines, like the opportunity to recruit Minthara in Baldur’s Gate 3, for instance. If players can recruit a certain companion in the game and ensure that they do not leave before the end of Act 2, they may end up unlocking a secret dialogue, which reveals more information about them and their widely evident daddy issues.

                  For One Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Race, Romance Is Very, Very Different   Baldur’s Gate 3 doesn’t include every race in the Forgotten Realms, but one that made it into the game has wildly different views of romance.   


 Wyll Talks About His Mother In Baldur’s Gate 3 
         




During Act 2, players can actually hear Wyll talk about his mother. This is very rare since there are no other mentions of her throughout the entire game. The main names mentioned by Wyll are Mizora, his demonic master, and Duke Ulder Ravengard, his father who is in need of urgent rescue from the Absolutists’ grasp. As noted by user TheImageworks on Reddit, it is possible to talk to Wyll during the quest to find Arabella’s missing parents in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. As seen in the post’s second edit, it is not necessary to romance Wyll in Baldur’s Gate 3 in order to unlock this secret piece of dialogue.



The time frame for this dialogue is quite limited. It is necessary to talk to Wyll after finding the young tielfing Arabella in Act 2 and before locating her parents.






 What Wyll Reveals About His Mom In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          




When talking to Wyll, players can ask him why he has not spoken about his mother, despite talking constantly about his father. As demonstrated in the video posted by Zanysatsuma on YouTube, Wyll’s answer is quite a simple one: “There’s nothing to tell. She died when I was born.” As such, Wyll never actually met his mother. He mentions that he never felt the lack of a mother in his life due to his close bond with his father, Duke Ravengard in Baldur’s Gate 3. During this special conversation, Wyll hints that he misses his mother, despite not meeting her.

He talks about how he never missed her growing up with a close connection to his father, but that “now” things may have changed. Wyll confesses that he imagines how life “would’ve been like if she’d lived.” He sees himself pondering if he would have ever left the city expelled by his father or if he would have been forced into his unholy pact with the cambion Mizora. Despite his imagination, Wyll explains that there is no use in lingering on possibilities that will never come to fruition and that he prefers to dedicate his attention to the present and future rather than that which occurred in the past.






This ends the special dialogue with Wyll in which he talks about his mother. As of now, there are no other mentions of Wyll’s mother in Baldur’s Gate 3.




                  A Hidden Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Weapon Includes A Clever Mechanic More Games Should Use   Baldur’s Gate 3 revives an age-old weapon mechanic that more games should borrow from. Here’s how, and why most players will never even notice it.   



 Wyll’s Revelation In Baldur’s Gate 3 Helps Flesh Him Out As A Character 
          

The revelation that Wyll’s mother died in childbirth and that he never actually got to meet her is subtle and minor, however, it helps flesh him out as a companion character. It does not establish a direct connection to Wyll’s other relationships in the game, but it does offer some insight as to why his relationship with his father is so complicated and exactly why he is always trying to prove himself in the eyes of Duke Ravengard, in the most obvious form of daddy issues in Baldur’s Gate 3. The lack of his second parental figure seems to have bound Wyll to his father in an unhealthy way.




Upon losing that approval, he may have felt lost and without direction. This revelation may also explain why Wyll would take on such a risky contract with Mizora. The cambion is in no way a mother figure to the Blade of Frontiers but she does offer him a means of reconciliation and approval in the eyes of his father. With the infernal power granted to him by the pact of The Fiend established with Mizora, Wyll can be a strong warlock, worthy of the acknowledgment as one of the protectors of the Sword Coast in Baldur’s Gate 3 and, therefore, love from his estranged father.

Though more details about Wyll and his father’s relationship could be provided throughout the story to give more weight to his whole journey as a character, what is shown off in the campaign is more than enough to put his daddy issues in the spotlight. With the hidden dialogue in Act 2 in which Wyll talks about his mother, a lot more about how he perceives the world around him and his connection to Duke Ravengard is evidenced, even if through a fairly simple revelation set in a few sentences. Wyll is one of the least developed companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, but this gives him an extra layer.




                  Hidden Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Side Quest Makes An Earlier Lose-Lose Decision A Lot Better   Act 1 gives you a side quest that feels like a loss no matter what, but you can fix this in Act 3 with the help of a feline friend in need of a home.   

This is but another example that some of the smaller details in the game tend to also hide some of the best secrets, be they for fleshing out companions as characters with a wide emotional range and compelling backstory or simply the lore of the world or map areas. As is the case with many other dialogue options in Larian’s RPG, players can completely miss out on interesting revelations if they do not pay attention or ask the correct questions when they have the opportunity. Even removing the Shadow Curse can easily be skipped, for instance, so Wyll’s secret revelation does not come as a surprise in Baldur’s Gate 3.
