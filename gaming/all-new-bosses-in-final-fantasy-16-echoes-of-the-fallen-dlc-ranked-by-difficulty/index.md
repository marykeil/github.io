## SUMMARY 


 The Echoes of the Fallen DLC for FF16 introduces new bosses that offer varying levels of difficulty, providing a challenge without being the hardest fights in the game. 
 The DLC should be played in the late game, with players leveling up Clive close to the game&#39;s level cap before attempting the bosses.

## Literature Review

Echoes of the Fallen adds a series of new challenging bosses to Final Fantasy 16. Here they all are, ranked from least to most difficult.




Final Fantasy 16&#39;s first DLC, Echoes of the Fallen, adds several new bosses of varying difficulty. The DLC is meant to be played in the late game, just before beginning the final quest. Players should probably level up Clive almost to the base game&#39;s level cap of 50 before attempting to take it on. As a result, these bosses fit pretty well in the wider context of the game. They&#39;re not the most difficult fights in FF16, but they are challenging.
As always, FF16&#39;s new bosses can be fought on one of the default difficulty modes, on Final Fantasy Mode after having beaten the game, or on Ultimaniac Mode after having beaten it in Final Fantasy Mode. They&#39;re all themed after Fallen technology, and are based around the concept of an artificial Mothercrystal secreted away in the Sagespire. Most of them function as the Sagespire&#39;s defense systems. There are four new bosses in FF16: Echoes of the Fallen. The DLC takes roughly three hours to complete, with about a third of that being spent on boss fights. Here are all the new bosses, ranked from least to most difficult.
            
 
 Final Fantasy 16 DLC Expansions: Story, Price &amp; Release Details 
Two DLC expansions for Final Fantasy 16 were announced at The Game Awards 2023. Here’s everything there is to know about FF16’s new and upcoming DLC.












 








 4  Sigma Is The FF16 DLC&#39;s Warm-Up Round 
Rewards The Fallen Enforcer, Echoes of The Fallen&#39;s Second-Best Weapon
        

Sigma is the first boss that players will encounter in Echoes of the Fallen, appearing as Clive, Jill, and Joshua pursue the black market crystal merchants into the Sagespire. It&#39;s the Sagespire&#39;s first line of defense, and manages to scare the merchants off before lunging at Clive. Sigma is a skull-faced, mechanized bodyguard. It can launch itself pretty far across the battlefield, so don&#39;t think Clive is safe just because he appears to be out of range. However, Sigma&#39;s moveset is mostly limited to melee attacks, like Ballistic Kick and a variety of unnamed punch-kick combos. That means most of its attacks can be Precision Blocked for easy counters.
Once Sigma gets down below half HP, it&#39;ll start using ranged attacks more frequently. These are well telegraphed and easy to avoid. Other than learning its attack patterns and hitting it with powerful combos, there&#39;s no real trick to defeating Sigma. Its Will gauge depletes pretty quickly, so players can simply grind that down before unleashing their most powerful Eikonic Strikes to chunk off its HP. Since Sigma will be many players&#39; first experience with FF16 after a few months away, this could be considered a retraining exercise. Beat Sigma and Clive will claim the Fallen Enforcer, an excellent sword and a necessary ingredient in crafting the DLC&#39;s ultimate weapon.





 3  FF16&#39;s Omicron Has A Tricky Attack Pattern 
Rewards Bombardment Bit, A New Accessory In Echoes Of The Fallen
        

It&#39;s debatable whether Omicron is actually a boss. It&#39;s technically a recurring enemy, it&#39;s scored by the normal battle music, and it displays its level openly above its HP bar, all of which are untrue of most FF16 bosses. However, it certainly plays out like a boss fight: Omicron is significantly tougher than Sigma, and can deal a lot of damage if players aren&#39;t careful. It might be best to consider Omicron a mini-boss that returns later as a regular enemy, which is nothing out of the ordinary for Final Fantasy.
However, it can be a bit difficult to master the proper dodge/parry timing required for the Omicron fight. Omicron always rears back before charging forward, which means there&#39;s a slight delay between when its attack animation starts and when Clive needs to dodge. After a little trial and error, the timing should come naturally, opening up the opportunity for Precision Blocks and counters. The reward for beating Omicron is the Bombardment Bit, one of the new accessories added by Echoes of the Fallen. It increases Will damage done by aerial attacks, which comes in handy during the next boss battle.





 2  Angra Mainyu Specializes In AoEs 
Rewards Aqueous Humours And Living Tissue For The Omega Weapon
        

Remember Ahriman, the easiest Hunt target in FF16? Angra Mainyu is like a powered-up version of that, strengthened by the dark crystal growing out of its head. Like the C-Rank Ahriman earlier in FF16, it has a ton of ranged attacks, spells, and AoEs, which means Clive will need to be quick on his feet. However, once he does get in close enough to hit it, Angra Mainyu&#39;s Will bar depletes pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it does have high defense, so getting its HP down is another story.
Angra Mainyu&#39;s most frustrating attack is Roulette, which spawns an arena-wide AoE marker with only a few safe slices. The marker begins to spin rapidly, and Clive must chase it in dizzying circles. The positioning is harder, but it&#39;s best to stay close to the center of the wheel. Angra Mainyu is left wide open after casting Roulette, so that&#39;s the best possible time to pelt it with Eikonic attacks. Overall, the most important tactic in this fight is to dodge continuously; only attack when Clive is 100% safe. The reward here includes three Aqueous Humours and some Living Tissue, both of which are needed to craft the Omega Weapon.





 1  Omega Is Echoes Of The Fallen&#39;s Final Boss 
Rewards The Omega Nodule, Which Is Needed To Craft FF16&#39;s Strongest Weapon


 







The final boss of FF16&#39;s Echoes of the Fallen DLC is appropriately named Omega. It&#39;s a synthetic Eikon, and the last line of defense in the Sagespire&#39;s automated system. It may not be as difficult as FF16&#39;s final boss, but it&#39;s a complicated fight, playing out over three phases across two forms. Thankfully, the first phase is pretty easy. Omega shows off a huge arsenal of attacks, but they&#39;re all pretty easy to dodge. The only thing players really need to worry about is Bombardment, since its attacks are strung more closely together. But simply dodging continuously and wearing down Omega&#39;s Will gauge should be enough to beat phase one.
Things get significantly harder in phase two. Omega transforms into Omega Aionos, and begins blanketing the ground with AoEs. These should be avoided whenever possible - but it won&#39;t always be possible. The move Ion Efflux is of particular concern: Omega rains slow-falling orbs down on the battlefield, which will stun Clive and leave him open to further onslaughts. If it drags its claws along the ground, be ready: it&#39;s about to send out two shockwaves of damage in quick succession. Omega Aionos can also string attacks together in wild, unpredictable patterns, so it may take a couple of attempts to learn all its tells.
The third phase of the Omega fight is brief, but it&#39;s not any easier. Omega will continue using its moves from phases one and two, all while slowly shrinking the battlefield towards the center. Don&#39;t worry about taking damage here: Clive needs to focus on offense to end the fight before the floor gives out beneath him. Just heal through it as much as possible while pulling out all the stops to take Omega down. The reward here is the Omega Nodule, the final piece of the Omega Weapon. It&#39;s even stronger than FF16&#39;s ultimate weapon Gotterdammerung, so it&#39;s absolutely worth the effort.
The new bosses in Echoes of the Fallen may not be the hardest in FF16, but they definitely provide a challenge. A little preparation can go a long way, though: showing up to any fight with a full inventory of Potions makes learning the ropes so much easier. As always, the key to beating Final Fantasy 16&#39;s Echoes of the Fallen DLC is to memorize enemy attack patterns and capitalize on their openings.
