# Super Mario Bros. Wonder Is Missing One Feature To Make It A Masterpiece


## SUMMARY 



  Super Mario Bros. Wonder is one of the most creative entries in the long-running series thanks to its psychedelic Wonder Flower effects.   The reality-altering effects from the Wonder Flowers would be great experienced in VR, alongside the game&#39;s other mind-bending transformations.   Nintendo has yet to enter the VR market, but has a number of franchises that could be impressively adapted to such technology.

## Literature Review

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is an incredible experience that is fun and chaotic, but there is still one thing that could have made it cooler.




Super Mario Bros. Wonder is already the most mind-bending and chaotic example of any Mario game, yet it could be even more so with one tech-enhanced feature. The game brings Mario and his friends to the Flower Kingdom, where they witness Bowser take control of the magical Wonder Flower and transform not just Prince Florian&#39;s castle, but the entire kingdom, into a weirdly dark and sinister land. Naturally, Mario&#39;s crew eagerly jumps in to help defeat Bowser. Along the way, they get to see just how weird things can get with the Wonder Flower&#39;s mystical magic, which is somewhat more of a psychedelic, drug-induced episode than any traditional ideas of witchcraft.




Wonder Effects are the main feature of Super Mario Bros. Wonder and happen whenever the characters collect a Wonder Flower in the levels. They can transform the entire level, causing a variety of new game mechanics or even transforming the characters themselves. These are in addition to other power-ups such as the infamous new Elephant power-up that was introduced in Wonder, and the special character abilities that can be added with Prince Florian&#39;s badges. All these things put together mean that this game is an experience that is full of wacky, chaotic fun, and yet it could have been even better if set in an even more mind-bending technological space.

                  Super Mario Bros. Wonder Review: &#34;Mario&#39;s Most Magical Adventure&#34;   Super Mario Bros. Wonder releases on Nintendo Switch this month, and for players young and old it&#39;s nothing but a delightful experience.   


 Super Mario Bros. Wonder Needs To Be Available In Virtual Reality 
A VR Experience Would Be The Ultimate Chaos
         




Super Mario Bros. Wonder&#39;s Wonder Effects are perfect for a VR setting, with the near-hallucinogenic colors and patterns mixed with the constant barrage of transformations. Whether facing a situation with Super Star showers, Bulrush stampedes, or having the sparkly Dark Mario chasing the player through a level, it would feel a bit like a variety of minigames but with all having the same general focus and cohesion. The music and swirling colors already serve to create a bit of a mind-bending feature, and when a player is placed in the center of this expressive setting, it would be hard not to feel immersed in the sensations.

                  Super Mario Bros. Wonder Is The  st Weâ€™ll Ever Get To M-Rated Mario   Most longtime franchise fans who play Super Mario Bros. Wonder will pick up on the evident psychedelic, trippy nature of the Wonder Flower sequences.    



 Power-Up Effects Would Be Even More Wondrous In VR 
Transformations Would Be Extra Trippy
          




Aside from the world-changing effects that the Wonder Flower can cause, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has many opportunities for the main character to transform. Whether Mario and his friends have grabbed a power-up that changes them into an elephant, or the triggered Wonder Effect makes them become a Spike Ball or Goomba, experiencing the change from a virtual reality perspective would be a unique feeling that could be much more impressive than simply watching it happen on a 2D screen. Seeing an elephant&#39;s trunk appear in front of the player&#39;s sightline and being able to use it to strike objects could be a challenge to control correctly and adapt to the VR, yet if handled correctly, it would be truly wondrous.

The less transformative power-ups would also benefit from being used in a VR space, such as the Bubble Flower. A player being able to throw a bubble out in front of them to either aim at trapping enemies or time it just right, so they can jump on top of it would add a layer of complexity and challenge, but in a fun way. Simply being able to throw the familiar Mario fireballs could be enjoyable enough to make it all worth it.






 Nintendo Needs Virtual Reality For Games Like Wonder 
Perhaps The Next Nintendo Console Will Include VR
          

Virtual Reality headsets have come a long way in recent years with the advancements in technology, and can truly give players a sense of being immersed in the world of whatever game is being played. As VR is becoming increasingly popular, some major game developers are offering VR versions of some of their titles, such as Arizona Sunshine 2 and the Resident Evil 4 remake. While it remains to be seen if this trend will continue for major games to be released in both formats, currently Nintendo does not have a Nintendo brand VR headset. As the gaming giant does not typically allow for its exclusive Nintendo franchises to be played on other companies&#39; systems, it is at a disadvantage in this arena.

In the past, Nintendo has been among the first gaming companies to attempt new and even experimental hardware for use with its video games. The Nintendo Switch is an example of this, with its unique design that allows it to transition from a handheld to a docked system. If the next console for Nintendo includes a virtual reality adaptation, Super Mario Bros. Wonder would hopefully be among the top contenders for a game to showcase its capabilities. It, along with many of the Nintendo-exclusive games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or even Mario Kart, would be magnificent to experience in that capacity.




                  10 Essential Meta Quest 2 Games You&#39;ll Want To Download &amp; Play First   Over 500 games are available for the Meta Quest 2, which can be a daunting thought, but here are 10 of the best ones to add to a VR game library.   

All that having been said, one of the things that makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder feel so much like a classic Super Mario game is the simple fact that it went back to its roots of being more of a standard 2D side-scrolling platformer. Mixing things up too much by taking that world and changing it to not only 3D but a VR space would essentially take away many of the essential pieces that make the game feel comforting and familiar despite its chaotic psychedelic effects. So, while Super Mario Bros. Wonder would be a fantastic thing to experience in VR, it may be even better left just as it is.
