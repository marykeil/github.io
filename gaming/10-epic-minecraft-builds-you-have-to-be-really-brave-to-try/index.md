## Literature Review

These 10 Minecraft builds are so intricate and large that it takes bravery to attempt recreating them, and an abundance of time and dedication.




Minecraft allows for an endless expression of creativity in both Survival Mode and Creative Mode. This sandbox of tools and materials has led to the creation of truly incredible builds that require no shortage of bravery to attempt recreating. While Creative Mode removes the dangers found in Survival Mode, it doesn&#39;t diminish the amount of time, effort, dedication, and attention to detail displayed in this set of epic builds.
Even with the protection of Creative Mode, it isn&#39;t easy to recreate the builds shown in this list. The scale of these builds, and the level of detail put into them can make them take years to complete. And for the builds that are done in Survival Mode, an extra layer of bravery is needed, especially since enemies and monsters can destroy sections of the structures, particularly when Creepers are involved.

 10  Willy Wonka&#39;s Chocolate Factory 
Minecraft Build By u/dancsa222 On Reddit
        

With a new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie coming out, it seems appropriate to mention this build of Willy Wonka&#39;s Chocolate Factory. This build doesn&#39;t necessarily replicate a particular factory from the multiple versions seen in the movies, but it takes inspiration from them to create a unique factory that still holds all the magic of Willy Wonka and his creations inside of it. Just be careful not to get too greedy and end up being evicted from the factory like the children - aside from Charlie - do in the movie!

 9  Basilica 
Minecraft Build By u/piprek On Reddit
        

This build might not seem extravagant, but it embodies the elegance and sanctity of a basilica. The difficulty here comes from the size and the repetitive nature of the design. While it might not seem too hard at a glance, actually replicating the build and its architecture would take a lot of time and patience.





 8  Steampunk City 
Minecraft Build By u/Tarpus_ On Reddit


 







This build isn&#39;t based on any particular reference. Instead, it&#39;s a city that the creator has named Mirapolis, and it&#39;s a sprawling creation with towering buildings that glow in the dark. It might not cover as much area as some of the builds listed here, but the level of detail put into the towers and how high they reach kicks them up into the epic category. The design of the architecture borders futuristic with a touch of the past perfectly, and the addition of light on the buildings makes this city beautiful whether it&#39;s day or night.





 7  Survival Mode Castle 
Minecraft Build By u/la_tomate_qc On Reddit
        

This build is not only massive but it was created in Survival Mode, meaning that the threat of death and destruction was a real possibility during its creation. There&#39;s also the threat that enemies could spawn in areas of the build that aren&#39;t properly lit, causing damage and possibly destroying sections that need to be rebuilt. In the end, this build might not be the largest, but it might require the most bravery, given the risks it brings.

 6  Multiverse 
Minecraft Build By u/ChrisDaCow On Reddit
        

Creating a multiverse in Minecraft is no small feat, and definitely not one that would be easy - or perhaps possible - in Survival Mode. The only thing that makes it a bit easier is that the build doesn&#39;t detail every individual Earth. Instead, it shows dozens of planets that represent variations of Earth, making up the infinitely many possibilities that contribute to the multiverse theory.





 5  Westeros (Game Of Thrones) 
Minecraft Build From Westeroscraft
        

This build requires an entire server to create, and even that might not be enough to truly capture the entirety of Westeros, the location where the bulk of A Song of Ice and Fire takes place. This is a collaborative project that anybody can take part in, helping to collectively create the Seven Kingdoms in Minecraft. So, if taking on this build alone sounds like too much, it&#39;s possible to join the existing project and contribute to this epic build without having to start from scratch.





 4  Azeroth (Warcraft) 
Minecraft Build From CraftingAzeroth
        

Westeros isn&#39;t the only fictional world being recreated in the world of Minecraft with a painstaking level of detail. Azeroth, the primary world from World of Warcraft, also exists in block form on its own server. And the map is available to download so that Azeroth can be used as the map of any server for those who aren&#39;t brave enough to try recreating it on their own. Or for those who don&#39;t have the time or patience to completely recreate a fictional world.

 3  Night City (Cyberpunk 2077) 
Minecraft Build From ElysiumFire


 







Not every fictional world created in Minecraft has medieval or fantasy as its main theme. This build brings the world of Cyberpunk 2077 to Minecraft. Massive and detailed, even looking at the pictures of this map makes it intimidating to imagine trying to start from scratch and recreate it alone. Luckily, there&#39;s a map of it available for download for anybody who doesn&#39;t have the bravery or time to create the build themselves.





 2  Elden World (Elden Ring) 
Minecraft Build Created By SeriousCraft
        

This build is based on Elden Ring. While it isn&#39;t a perfect recreation of the game in Minecraft, it allows for the creation of a character and story progression, which takes this build a step further than most builds that recreate the worlds of other fictional materials. Just like Elden Ring, the builds found in this map are massive, and the same bravery might be needed to recreate them from scratch, especially the dungeons.





 1  Middle Earth (The Lord Of The Rings) 
Minecraft Build Created By MinecraftMiddleEarth


 







And the final entry is Middle Earth, Tolkien&#39;s beloved fantasy world recreated in Minecraft. From the Pillar of Kings to Bag End, the scale of this build is breathtaking, and the attention to detail only reinforces that factor. Recreating this build from scratch would be a monumental task, and the bravery to take on a project that would likely span several years. Instead, it might be easier just to download the map and spend that time exploring it rather than trying to create it again.
Minecraft is the perfect place to express creativity with its sandbox properties and the number of mods available to customize the appearance of the blocks. However, some creators take their Minecraft builds to the next level to create truly epic structures that can span an entire map. With enough time and dedication, any build can turn into the next epic build that might inspire bravery in other creators looking to turn their servers or world into something unique in Minecraft.
