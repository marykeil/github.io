## Literature Review

Team GO Rocket Boss Giovanni returns for trainers to face in Pokémon GO with a familiar line-up for January 2024 led by Legendary Shadow Regigigas.





If you haven&#39;t already defeated him, beating Giovanni in January gives you the chance to catch the Legendary Normal-type Pokémon Regigigas. You will once again need to first defeat the three Team GO Rocket leaders, Arlo, Sierra, and Cliff, before being able to face Giovanni at Pokéstops.

 Giovanni&#39;s Team In Pokémon GO (January 2024) 
An unchanged line-up for January
          

At the start of January 2024, Giovanni&#39;s Team is unchanged in Pokémon GO from December. Previously, his team had not changed for months at a time, so it is expected that he will continue with this line-up throughout the start of 2024. Giovanni will use three out of his squad of five Pokémon in every battle.

For January 2024 Giovanni continues to use long-time opener Normal-type Persian. His second Pokémon will be one of three out of Poison- and Ground-type Nidoking, Dragon- and Ground-type Garchomp, or Water-type Kingler. Regardless of which one he chooses, his final Pokémon will always be the Legendary Normal-type Regigigas.

 Best Counters For Giovanni In Pokémon GO (January 2024) 
Using Fighting Pokémon to take control
          

Giovanni&#39;s Pokémon all are strong attackers so you need to pick a line-up that can quickly take them out. The two Pokémon that Giovanni uses in every battle, Normal-type Persian and Regigigas, are both weak against Fighting attacks. Using strong Fighting-types that can quickly build up charged attacks, such as Machamp or Lucario, is key to beating Giovanni in January 2024.




For his second Pokémon, Giovanni will use one of three possible options. Using an Ice-type Pokemon, such as Mamoswine will be super effective against two of the options, Nidoking and Garchomp. So using this alongside two Fighting Pokémon is recommended for this battle. The other option is to include an electric-type in case Giovanni selects Kingler.

Giovanni&#39;s Pokémon team still offers a tough test in January 2024, but he can be beaten by selecting a team that covers all of his options in Pokémon GO.
