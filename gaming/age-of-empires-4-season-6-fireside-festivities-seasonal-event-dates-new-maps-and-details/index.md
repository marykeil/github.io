## Literature Review

Many good things are happening with Age of Empires 4 including a new holiday event, Season 6 of ranked challenges, and even a new expansion.




The Season 6 update for Age of Empires 4 brings a Fireside Festivities seasonal event, new maps, and much more to the game just in time for the holidays. This free update is happening alongside the launch of the game&#39;s first major paid expansion, The Sultans Ascend, but doesn&#39;t require the purchase of the expansion to participate in the cozy event and try out several new maps or enjoy Season 6. All three of these massive content drops happen at the same time, offering unique benefits and rewards for each.




Age of Empires 4 is a real-time strategy game where players lead and grow a civilization, doing battle with opposing civilizations controlled by either AI or other humans. Update 9.1.109 to the game will add three new maps to the base game as well as expansion-exclusive maps that will be available in the ranked map pool for Season 6 for a while for everyone to sample them. Additionally, some quality-of-life changes are included to help make walls easier to build, balance changes, and updates to the AI.

                  Age of Empires 4 Review: Where Nostalgia &amp; Modernization Meet   Age of Empires 4 manages to modernize the series while keeping the most familiar elements, but its focus on warfare may detract from its charm.

Although Season Six doesn&#39;t begin until November 15, the Fireside Festivities event begins on November 14 at 10:00 am PT and will end on December 4 at 11:59 pm PT. The event will have special challenges to work towards, providing festive rewards, including portraits and coats of arms.

 New Maps For Age Of Empires 4 
Three Maps Added To Base Game
         

Three maps are added to the base game of Age of Empires 4, which will be available to play as early as November 14. These are free and not part of the expansion content, which has even more maps included with it. These free maps include:

  Canal   Gorge   Rocky River  

The new maps offer opportunities to try out new strategies and add a fresh experience to the gameplay. They will all be included in the 1v1 Ranked Map Pool for Season Six, and the Gorge map will be included in the Team Ranked Map Pool.

After much demand was shown for it, the Empire Wars game mode will be available as an option in Quick Match beginning with Season Six. Empire Wars provides a bit of an early-game head-start for players to quickly get into the faster pace of the mid-game action.

Here are the maps that will be available for Season Six of Age of Empires 4 Ranked Play:

 1V1 Ranked Map Pool  Team Ranked Map Pool   Arabia  Arabia   Canal (new map)  Cliffside (expansion preview map)   Cliffside (expansion preview map)  Golden Heights   Golden Heights  Golden Pit (expansion preview map)   Golden Pit (expansion preview map)  Gorge (new map)   Gorge (new map)  Hidden Valley (expansion preview map)   Hidden Valley (expansion preview map)  Hideout   Himeyama (expansion preview map)  Himeyama (expansion preview map)   Rocky River (new map)  Volcanic Island   






Another change players will notice that was made this Season is that the number of downvotes for maps in Quick Match is now 15 rather than seven.

                  Age of Empires 4: How to Set Up Multiplayer Co-op   Cooperate with up to three friends and crush the AI with the help of some strategic allies in Age of Empires IV&#39;s Multiplayer Co-op vs. AI mode.   



 Season 6 Launches Alongside The Sultans Ascend Expansion 
Paid Expansion Launches November 14
          

The paid expansion to Age of Empires 4: The Sultans Ascend releases on November 14, 2023. This expansion is noteworthy because the game will add the Byzantine and Japanese civilizations to the game as playable civilizations with their own music, speech, buildings, landmarks, and more. Additionally, ten new maps, two biomes, an 8-mission single-player campaign, and many new achievements and unlockable content are added.





 

There are many more tweaks and changes to the game that come with update 1.9.109 on November 14. Small but meaningful details, such as ringing the bell in the town square to call villagers to safety when attacking armies charge and having omnidirectional gates, make the game much more enjoyable. All three of these massive content updates arrive on November 14 and 15, 2023, for Age of Empires 4.
