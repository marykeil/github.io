## Literature Review

Mary Jane plays a significant part in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, but what really happens to her throughout the duration of the latest Spider-Man game?




Mary Jane Watson plays a significant role in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, both from a narrative perspective as Peter&#39;s girlfriend, but also as a temporarily playable character, and most interestingly as part of one of the game&#39;s more surprising twists. MJ was introduced to the Spider-Man canon in 1965; since then she has gone on to become Peter Parker&#39;s main love interest and the principal beneficiary of his affection in the franchise&#39;s many movies, comics, and video games.

Throughout Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, MJ goes on an emotional adventure that is every part as dramatic as Peter Parker or Miles Morales. With twists and turns, personal development, and a character arc to match any other figure in the game, MJ is quite possibly the most consistently likable character in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. Mary Jane is incredibly well-rounded as a character, and an integral part of the story and gameplay, with her playable segments greatly improved over those of the first game, and her surprising turn into Scream being one of the game&#39;s more engaging boss fights.

A Complicated Relationship With Peter Parker
          




Mary Jane&#39;s first appearance in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 takes place through phone calls, with her first true introduction coming while dropping off some boxes at Peter&#39;s house (formerly Aunt May&#39;s residence in Queens). The couple meet outside his house and share a kiss as Peter confesses that he lost his job as a result of the Sandman fight, the first boss battle in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2. After looking at some old photos of Peter, MJ has to leave; however, she quickly runs into a recently hospitalized Harry, who is waiting outside of Peter&#39;s house - this interaction between the trio represents the introduction of the Venom&#39;s host to the player.

From this early scene, until relatively late in the game, the vast majority of interactions that feature Mary Jane are of pretty significant consequence to the game. MJ&#39;s scenes often help build the narrative and demonstrate the growth and development of her relationship with Peter - a relationship that becomes extremely strained during Peter&#39;s time playing host to the alien symbiote, Venom. During this time, the player gets to experience controlling MJ as she attempts to help Peter rid himself of the symbiote suit, a personal mission that ultimately puts her in serious danger - perhaps even more so after she succeeds.




After Peter rids himself of Venom, he calls MJ and apologizes for all the harm he has caused her, the rest of his friends, and his loved ones. He swears to return the symbiote to Dr. Curt Connors and Oscorp, which although a noble endeavor, results in Harry becoming the host of a now fully powered Venom - an unforeseen consequence that has dramatic and unexpected repercussions for MJ. During a reconciliatory video call with Peter, MJ is interrupted by a knock at the door - the visitor is Harry and the call suddenly ends.

The Symbiote Turns Mary Jane Into Scream
         

As Peter rushes home to save Mary Jane, he will find Harry sitting at the dining table across from her. Following a brief conversation, Venom takes over Harry and knocks down Peter, before he grabs Mary Jane by the neck and drags her into the kitchen. After Peter manages to dislodge himself from beneath an overturned fridge, he rushes into the kitchen - finding it in a state of disrepair. Venom is bent over the overturned table, and after standing up it is revealed that he has transformed Mary Jane into the yellow and red symbiote known as Scream - one of five symbiote spawns created by Venom in the Spider-Man comics.




Mary Jane as Scream grabs Peter with her hair and violently throws him through a window and into the side of a passing bus - causing a multi-car pile-up. After this, Venom directs Scream to show Peter what he is missing, beginning one of the hardest boss battles in the game. The incredibly unexpected and tough four-stage boss battle takes place in the streets, gardens, and construction sites around Peter&#39;s house. The battle concludes after Scream&#39;s health is drastically lowered a fourth and final time, at which point, with the help of a cacophony of sirens, heavy machinery, and other loud noises, MJ resurfaces and frees herself from the grip of the symbiote.

                  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2: How to Beat Scream (Boss Fight)   Scream is one of the toughest, and possibly most surprising, bosses Peter will face in Spider-Man 2 &amp; her fight takes place over four intense phases.

Immediately after freeing herself from Scream, Mary Jane and Peter share a touching moment and a hug. During the same cut scene, MJ interrupts the couple&#39;s tender moment by picking up a call from her boss, J. Jonah Jameson. Jameson screams at MJ over the location of his apple fritters, to which she abruptly tells him to kiss her ass before quitting her job. The cut scene concludes with an emotional embrace between MJ and Peter, during which, the heavens open, and the pair have a deeply vulnerable conversation concerning the past few months of their lives before sharing a kiss as Peter departs to go help Miles.

Though this is possibly MJ&#39;s most pivotal part in the story of Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, she does not disappear from the game. Playing a significant part in the game&#39;s conclusion alongside Miles and Peter, MJ helps the pair during the game&#39;s difficult final boss battle against Venom by infiltrating the subway tunnel and retrieving the meteorite the symbiote was found with. At the end of the game, MJ proves to be a source of emotional strength for Peter, helping him cope with the pain and fear of what will happen to Harry, as well as the intense guilt he feels after being lambasted by Harry&#39;s father, Norman Osborne.




After the battle and during some of the game&#39;s final moments, MJ delivers a touching voice-over, in which she provides some narrative information and updates on their lives after the events of the final battle. Furthermore, before the final mission in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, Mary Jane calls Peter and lets him know that she has finally given her landlord notice, and that she will move in with him. The final scenes of the game, prior to its final credits scenes, show Peter and MJ living happily in their home, hosting a dinner of pancakes with a group of their friends.
