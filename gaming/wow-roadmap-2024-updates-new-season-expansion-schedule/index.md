World of Warcraft has big things coming in 2024 and beyond, for both the current, so-called retail version of the game and the popular WoW Classic that turns back time to before many of the changes that have happened in Azeroth over the decades. The ever-changing, yet familiar, MMORPG is turning 20 this year, but that isn&#39;t slowing it down any. Several new features and content additions are coming to both versions of the game, including the first in the upcoming trilogy of expansions that will comprise The Worldsoul Saga.




As the game enters its 20th year, it continues to be the all-time most popular leader of MMOs, with huge populations of active players in both the modern version of World of Warcraft and in World of Warcraft Classic. The already massive story of the adventures taking place in Azeroth continues to evolve and grow with every passing year, and in 2024 that trend continues. Over the coming months, numerous updates and content drops will frequently be added to both versions of WoW.

 World Of Warcraft&#39;s Worldsoul Saga Is Just Beginning 
2024&#39;s WoW: The War Within Expansion Is Part One Of Three
          

2024&#39;s launch of the WoW: The War Within expansion is the first of a multi-expansion storyline that World of Warcraft will be telling over the next few years to celebrate its 20th Anniversary. The massive narrative will dig deep into the foundations of Azeroth with information on the Titans and the fate of Azeroth&#39;s world-soul. Because of the way they all tie together, the three expansions are planned to be released closer together than past expansions have been, and will form one overarching story.

Looking toward the future of WoW and WoW Classic, it feels as though the development teams at Blizzard just keep speeding up by adding more content at a rapid pace, ever-expanding the narrative and world of Azeroth and beyond. 2024 will be filled with nearly constant updates on both versions of the game, including many quality-of-life features and changes such as warbands, delves, and guild updates. World of Warcraft will have a busy year in 2024, and players should have plenty to do for a while.
