## Literature Review

Macy is a dateable photographer who wanders around Coral Island, taking pictures of nature. She loves video games and her pet lobster Stephen.





Since Macy was born on a different island, she lives in the Coral Inn, run by Alice and Suki. When she sends gifts in the mail to the player, she may send some pizza, some blue quartz, or a black sea urchin. Her favorite gifts may take effort to cultivate effectively, but if you want to marry Macy, they&#39;re worth the effort.




                  &#34;A Cozy Experience In The Tropics&#34;: Coral Island Review   A tropical-themed farm sim focusing on conservation, Coral Island hits all the right notes in creating a perfect island paradise and finding love.   


 Macy&#39;s Daily Schedule 
          

As a photographer, Macy spends her days all around the island. This can make it hard for her to pin down and track. Luckily, her seasonal differences are small, with only one or two days in a season different from the rest of the year. Some of her common spots include the Cavern, the Lookout, and the Abandoned Villa.

 Best Gifts For Romancing Macy 
          

Most characters in Coral Island have a special category of gifts they love, no matter what item within that category you give them. For Macy, that category is wine. If you want a solid collection of wine to give Macy, you will first need to build a keg with 30 wood, 2 bronze bars, one silver bar, and 20 scrap. You can make a keg at Farming Level 6. Put any fruit into the keg, and you will get some fruit juice. Then, at Farming Level 10, you can craft an aging barrel with 25 hardwood, 2 osmium bars, and 1 resin. Put the fruit juice into the aging barrel, and you will have wine for Macy in six days.

                  Coral Island: Pablo Romance Guide (Best Gifts &amp; Heart Events)   Pablo is one of two dateable blacksmiths in Coral Island. He&#39;s a charming, flirty, and helpful fellow with an odd love for all things pickled.   






Macy&#39;s birthday is Spring 25, making it almost impossible to have some wine to give her as a birthday gift in your first year on the island. Your best option for a Year 1 birthday gift is a daisy. Daisies are easy to grow at the beginning of spring and are universally liked. It may not be her favorite, but Macy will still love the simple white flower.




  Likes/Dislikes   Items    Loved Gifts   All wine, pizza, blue quartz, rose quartz, guacamole, fruit tart, pink diamond    Liked Gifts   All universally liked gifts not mentioned here    Neutral Gifts   All vegetables, all universally neutral gifts not mentioned here    Disliked Gifts   All fruits, all universally disliked gifts not mentioned here    Hated Gifts   All pickled goods, all metal bars, all bottled kelps, all universally hated gifts not mentioned here   





 All Heart Events For Macy 
         

As you win over this video game-loving photographer in Coral Island, you will slowly gain Hearts to reflect your relationship with Macy. Most of Macy&#39;s Heart Events are restricted to sunny weather, as her story takes you around the island. She has fewer Heart Events than other bachelors and bachelorettes in Coral Island, but they&#39;re still enjoyable and lively. Most events can trigger the day after you reach the required amount of Hearts, so rest before you set out to meet Macy.




  Hearts   Day   Time Period   Location    2 Hearts   Sunny weather   10:00 - 16:00   The Lookout    4 Hearts   Sunny weather   10:00 - 16:00   By the lake on the little island    6 Hearts   Sunny weather on a day not between Winter 17 and Winter 21   10:00 - 17:00   On the Beach    7 Hearts   Any day   18:00 - 23:00   In Macy&#39;s room    8 Hearts   Sunny weather on a day not between Winter 17 and Winter 21   18:00 -19:00   On the Western Beach    10 Hearts   Sunny weather on a day not between Winter 17 and Winter 21   18:00 -19:00   On the Western Beach   



To get above 8 Hearts, you will need to buy a locket from Sanchez Brothers Blacksmith. This locket will be available after you get to 8 Hearts. From there, get Macy to 10 Hearts, play through her last event, and you can ask her to marry you. With that, you successfully have a passionate, independent photographer for a partner in Coral Island.
