## Literature Review

Free time is a luxury, but the best expansive RPGs on PC make it well-worth spending with engaging journeys and interesting possibilities.




Length isn&#39;t always a good thing in games, but great experiences like certain RPGs on PC can make hour after hour feel worthwhile. Roleplaying games are one area where racking up 100 hours or more can be completely reasonable, with involving stories gaining extra mileage through diverse side content and potential for replayability. PC is the perfect destination for expansive RPG experiences of every type, and there&#39;s something for everyone looking to find a time-sink that will offer a major return on investment.
Lengthy RPGs are a long-standing tradition, dating back to some of the earliest genre titles like the Ultima series in the 1980s. The late 1990s saw a surge with RPGs like Baldur&#39;s Gate and Fallout, with most games focusing on isometric perspectives that laid out worlds in a clear and engaging way. Although it&#39;s easy to get 50 hours out of most of these games, they generally don&#39;t cross the 100-hour mark without a second run of the story. The past decade or so has seen a significant increase in RPGs that go the extra mile, with direct successors and new franchises alike delivering experiences that are longer than ever.

 10  Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (2021) 
Owlcat Games
        

Owlcast Games crafted an impressive RPG venture with Pathfinder: Kingmaker, but the experience wasn&#39;t short on flaws. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous doubles down on everything that was good about Kingmaker and shapes up everything that wasn&#39;t, resulting in an enormous RPG perfect for Pathfinder fans and newcomers alike. Although Kingmaker can still be fun to play, the 100&#43; hours that can easily be sunk into either title means starting with Wrath of the Righteous is generally a better bet.

 9  Kenshi (2013) 
Lo-Fi Games
        

Kenshi isn&#39;t an RPG for newcomers, as it can certainly be alienating and difficult at first glance, not to mention its rough graphical style. Spending the time necessary to understand the sandbox RPG, however, can yield fantastic results. A deeply reactive and enormous world rewards player choice in surprising ways, and mastering the punishing challenges that it has to offer to build a successful civilization feels immensely rewarding as a result.





 8  The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim (2011) 
Bethesda Game Studios


 







A number of titles from Bethesda Game Studios qualify as particularly lengthy PC RPGs, but The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim might take the cake just for the scale of its mod support. Finishing a vanilla playthrough of Skyrim is just the start, as there&#39;s no shortage of changes, improvements, and complete overhauls to try out. It&#39;s almost as much of a platform as it is a game, and appreciation for the title hasn&#39;t severely waned over a decade after its original release.

 7  Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age (2017) 
Square Enix
        

In a world where many Japanese RPG franchises have gone through efforts to adapt to a changing gaming landscape, Dragon Quest 11 is refreshingly old-school, sticking to the turn-based combat and charming art style that the series is known for. That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s content to rest on its laurels, however, with a huge adventure and involving world that can easily suck players in for over 100 hours of gameplay. Despite the number in the title, Dragon Quest 11 is a standalone experience, so its as perfect a place as any to jump into the series.

 6  Pillars of Eternity (2015) 
Obsidian Entertainment
        

Obsidian Entertainment is no stranger to great PC RPGs, with impressive titles like Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Fallout: New Vegas under its belt. The most surefire bet for a long playthrough might be Pillars of Eternity, which goes back to a classic isometric style updated nicely with modern improvements. What really sets Pillars of Eternity apart from other RPGs is the extraordinary amount of text, making it perfect for those who want to spend hours delving into worldbuilding and a potential skip for anyone who prefers the action side of things.





 5  Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014) 
BioWare
        

BioWare cut its teeth on games like the original Baldur&#39;s Gate, and despite multiplatform releases, the Dragon Age titles are a natural successor to the classic era of PC RPGs. Dragon Age: Inquisition is a particularly long experience, and it can be easy to pass 100 hours without resorting to grinding for minor achievements. Exciting action systems keep things moving, but the real star of the show might be the romance systems, which build on ideas from the Mass Effect games to create something truly special.





 4  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015) 
CD Projekt Red


 







The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a perfect choice for anyone who wants a story centered around a memorable protagonist, as Geralt of Rivia has the rich complexities and history necessary to really stand out. Set in the world first established in Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s novels, The Witcher 3 also emphasizes exciting monsters, gorgeous vistas, and moral shades of gray. The other games in the series are also worth playing - even if the first one can feel janky by comparison - but starting with the third can still be an excellent time.

 3  Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017) 
Larian Studios
        

The Divinity series had relatively humble origins as a quality franchise of moderate scope, but Divinity: Original Sin and its successor cranked things up to another level entirely. Divinity: Original Sin 2 has a story that can easily take 100 hours to complete with enough side questing, and this length is buoyed further by the amount of experimentation that the game allows. Its turn-based combat is far from a stiff affair, with interesting environmental reactions and a number of amusing possibilities offering something of a sandbox experience.





 2  Persona 5: Royal (2019) 
Atlus
        

Persona 5 is in the rare category of games where it&#39;s possible to rack up 100 hours even without seeking out much side content, as the story is fundamentally long and involving regardless. A heavy emphasis is placed on social aspects of gameplay, and building relationships between characters adds a lot of time to crawling dungeons and fighting enemies. Excellent presentation and fantastic music add a sense of style that remains engaging throughout, showing just why this Japanese RPG was such an enormous hit.

 1  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 (2023) 
Larian Studios


 







Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the definition of a breakout hit, gaining an enormous audience upon its official launch after several years spent in early access. With an enormous story, compelling characters, excellent combat encounters, and so, so much to do, it definitely deserves the attention it&#39;s received. For anyone interested in the PC RPG scene or Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a must-play, and it&#39;s easy to go well past 100 hours without even feeling fatigued.
