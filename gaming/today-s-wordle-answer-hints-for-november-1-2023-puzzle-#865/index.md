## Literature Review

November 1st’s Wordle answer should not cause many players much trouble, but there’s still a chance that they might need some hints. 





It might be a good idea to use Wordle’s hard mode to solve today’s answer as it will help in reducing risks. Since this mode doesn’t allow players to use random guesses, they can save many attempts by using words that will help solve the daily puzzle. Players will not be able to reuse confirmed letters, which makes this mode preferable for veterans. However, even veterans can get stuck sometimes and resort to using hints.
