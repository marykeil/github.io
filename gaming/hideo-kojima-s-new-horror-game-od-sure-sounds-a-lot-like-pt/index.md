## Literature Review

Hideo Kojima’s new horror game, OD, has finally been revealed, and there are a number of parallels between it and the canceled Silent Hill game, PT.





Following its premiere at The Game Awards, OD&#39;s trailer was uploaded to the Kojima Productions YouTube channel. The trailer shows very little about the game, but does provide a haunting first look at its cast, which includes Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier. With Xbox Game Studios attached, it&#39;s likely to be an Xbox Console exclusive, but there is no release window or date for OD just yet.





 

The OD teaser trailer exudes Kojima&#39;s signature artistry, leaving viewers and prospective players confused. The collaboration with Peele, though, should excite horror fans. After becoming well-known through sketch comedy with Key &amp; Peele, the latter of the duo has made a remarkably large name for himself with three lauded horror films – Get Out, Us, and Nope.

                  Jordan Peele Revealed Interest In Game Development To Hideo Kojima   In a recent appearance on developer Hideo Kojima&#39;s podcast, the brilliant Jordan Peele expressed an interest in creating a game of his own.   


 OD May Be Similar To Kojima&#39;s Canceled Silent Hills 
          




While there are very few details about OD, there are already many parallels to PT and what would&#39;ve been Kojima&#39;s Silent Hills, before the project was canceled by Konami. Even the bare minimum, with the two being two-letter titles, is immediately apparent. After Peele&#39;s introduction to The Game Awards&#39; stage, there was much discussion about how OD will attempt to revolutionize the genre, hoping to be unlike anything anyone has ever played. For many, PT still stands out as a novel experience, and the full project&#39;s cancelation is still considered a huge loss for the horror genre at large.

Kojima has had noticeable aspirations for innovation throughout his career, even up to his most recent release, Death Stranding, which – sometimes jokingly – is considered to have invented a new genre as a strand-type game. While this teaser trailer does little more than set an ominous tone for OD, it&#39;s clear that Kojima&#39;s wish to push the realm of horror games forward has continued even after PT and Silent Hills were shelved. Much is still unknown, but simply having Hideo Kojima and Jordan Peele attached to OD in tandem is enough to warrant keeping an eye on the game moving forward.
