## Literature Review

There are 14 fighters you can all recruit in Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name for the many battle challenges in the Coliseum Arena.





There are two modes to the Coliseum, with the recruited fighters tied to the Hell Team Rumble battles that see you and your allies take on waves of enemies. Each fighter has a special Heat Skill tied to them, much like Kiryu&#39;s Heat Mode. This gives them access to an individual ability that may be unleashed, similar to the moves you can perform in your Yakuza or Agent style in Like a Dragon Gaiden when you enter Heat.
