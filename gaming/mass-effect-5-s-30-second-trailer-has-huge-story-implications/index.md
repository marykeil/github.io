## Literature Review

N7 Day leads to new details about the series&#39; future each year. This year did not disappoint, offering clues that tie together separate storylines.




The latest teaser for Mass Effect 5 has some huge implications for the story. The 30-second trailer was released as the culmination of an N7 Day 2023 puzzle crafted by the team at Bioware, which had fans solving clues using ciphers, details from past N7 Day reveals, and general knowledge of the history of Mass Effect’s development. Onlookers were also treated to a new piece of art featuring the N7 armor-clad character shown in the trailer. Along the way, some new details were revealed that give significant clues about where Bioware is taking the next game’s story.




While the newest Mass Effect 5 trailer is admittedly short, there are a lot of details packed into its 30-second runtime that hint at the next game’s setting. The new N7 character is undoubtedly the biggest reveal, suggesting that this could be the player character for the next game. Architecture and flying cars are hidden in the trailer’s background, bringing to mind the vibe of the original Mass Effect trilogy, but there is arguably not enough to go on that narrows down the next game’s plot. However, the most substantial clues to Mass Effect 5’s story setting come from the buildup to the trailer reveal and the new artwork.


 N7 Day Details Suggest Mass Effect 5 Will Feature Milky Way &amp; Andromeda Storylines 
         

Details from the N7 Day 2023 reveal suggest that Mass Effect 5 will make a point of utilizing both the storylines from the trilogy and Mass Effect: Andromeda. There is a considerable time gap between the two, so there was some doubt whether or not these stories could be merged in a compelling way, and there still is. One fan, bbman497lego, summarized how the new details point to conclusions about Mass Effect 5’s setting and placement on the timeline.






“For anyone curious, there was a lot of text and stuff that accompanied the buildup to the release of this trailer. And it pretty definitively confirms this game will be tying together the Milky Way and Andromeda storylines. Meaning this game will be taking place in the 2800s, possibly later. That’s minimally over 630 years post-trilogy. This is further reinforced by the Angara visible in a piece of art also released today.”

The date hinted at in the N7 Day puzzle, and the Angara in the official art are important observations that help deduce what the next game will feature. However, it should be noted that definitive declarations about Mass Effect 5 and when it takes place are misguided at this time because the reality is not as cut and dry as some may think it to be.



 Mass Effect 5’s Setting &amp; Timeline Placement Are Still A Mystery 
          

Despite the N7 Day details offering new clues about the story, Mass Effect 5’s setting and timeline placement are still shrouded in mystery. Michael Gamble, Project Director for the next game, has previously hinted at the connection between the Milky Way and Andromeda storylines, so it’s unsurprising to see confirmation of this finally. However, to say that Mass Effect 5 will be set exclusively in the future, near Mass Effect: Andromeda’s time, is too firm a conclusion to make at this stage, especially since some conflicting details exist.





 

The teaser video from N7 Day 2022 has a date marker that suggests the year 2190, only a few years after Mass Effect 3. Moreover, the new art featuring the Angara also features a Geth, who weren’t reported to be traveling to Andromeda, which opens up a slew of questions. The truth is that Bioware is intentionally leaving details about the next game ambiguous, encouraging fans to speculate and craft theories.

Michael Gamble even fuels this speculation with cryptic Tweets. The team is providing just the right amount of details about Mass Effect 5 without completely committing to one concept or idea for the story. It’s a clever and engaging way to promote excitement for the game. Fans should relish in the joy of speculation and theory crafting at this time while remaining open to what the team at Bioware has in store.
