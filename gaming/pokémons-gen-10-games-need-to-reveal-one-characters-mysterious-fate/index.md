## Literature Review

Pokémon’s Generation 10 games offer the perfect opportunity to reveal what happened to one popular character whose fate has been left a mystery.




The next Pokémon games should finally reveal the fate of one popular character. The Generation 10 Pokémon games offer a perfect opportunity to tie up loose ends from previous games, bringing a conclusion to stories that have so far gone unfinished. One particular character’s personal story has tragically had no resolution so far, which has given one entry in the franchise a slight sense of lingering disappointment.




With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s story drawing to a close, speculation is slowly building over the franchise’s next titles. Remakes of Pokémon Black and White are strongly believed to be on the way, whether as part of Gen 9 or the next era of Pokemon. Meanwhile, the future core Gen 10 games will undoubtedly involve the debut of a new region and range of Pokémon. But regardless of what region players discover or revisit next, there is always the potential for details and characters from past titles to return, providing answers to lingering mysteries.


 Pokémon’s Gen 10 Could Reveal What Happened To Ingo 
          

Pokémon Legends: Arceus included a curious twist in the form of Ingo, the Unovan Subway Boss turned amnesiac Warden of the Pearl Clan. Having apparently fallen through time and space as a result of Volo and Giratina’s actions, Ingo has only the vaguest of memories regarding his twin brother Emmet and other aspects of his past. And as the game’s main story concludes, this is how Ingo remains: lost in the past with amnesia. His ultimate fate, whether he was eventually able to return to his proper time or else died in ancient Hisui, has remained a mystery ever since.




                  Where Ingo Is From In Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Ingo may have forgotten about his past in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, but savvy trainers who played Gen 5 will be able to remind him where he comes from.   

The possibility of Ingo never finding his way home is a tragic prospect, and a strong possibility without evidence to the contrary. Of course, if Legends: Arceus’ protagonist eventually returned to the present with Ingo in tow, then this could not be shown within the game, as it would prevent the postgame’s existence. As such, Ingo may have actually been safely reunited with his brother. But once again, there is no evidence of this so far in the franchise. Instead, it seems the only way for Ingo’s story to receive a proper resolution is for a future game to include even a minor reference to him.



 Ingo’s Fate Would Be Easy To Reveal In Any Game 
          




The revelation of Ingo’s fate does not necessarily need to be a particularly lengthy moment; even a mention of him by a random NPC could easily explain if he remained in Hisui or not. Such an inclusion would have been easy to include in the base Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games, and the DLC has likewise offered plenty of opportunities for a mention of Ingo. This is particularly true in the case of new character Perrin, who is clearly descended from Adaman of the Diamond Clan. Elsewhere, Professor Laventon makes his own Scarlet and Violet cameo in history class, making the lack of information on Ingo all the more notable.

                  Pokémon Legends: Arceus&#39; Biggest Plot Holes &amp; Unsolved Mysteries   Pokémon Legends: Arceus takes players back to the ancient days of the Pokémon universe, but plenty of major plot holes are opened along the way.   

The fact that Ingo has not been mentioned in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet so far, even though the upcoming epilogue leaves some room for surprises, makes it seem far more likely that any references to him will appear in an entirely new game. Of course, this game does not need to take in Ingo’s native Unova, or in Sinnoh; with both NPCs and news information capable of traveling the world, there are any number of ways in which Ingo’s presence or absence in the modern age could be confirmed. Naturally, this includes an appearance from the man himself, most likely in some kind of Battle Facility as a powerful opponent.






In Pokémon Black and White, as well as Black 2 and White 2, Ingo runs the Single Train of the Battle Subway, as well as appearing with Emmett in double battles on the Multi Train and Super Multi Train.




Notably, if the next Pokémon games are in fact remakes of Black and White, the titles that originally introduced Ingo, then the Subway Boss’ presence is all but inevitable as an integral part of the Battle Subway. However, this alone does not guarantee an explanation of Ingo’s fate; unless deliberate reference is made to Ingo’s time in Hisui, then as in the original games, his journey through time could easily come after his appearance here. In fact, it is possible that people will see Ingo’s disappearance, although to preserve the function of the Battle Subway he would then likely be returned to his proper place in time shortly afterward.



 A Conclusion To Ingo’s Story From Legends: Arceus Is Needed 
         




It would be immensely satisfying to finally have a definitive answer to what happened to Ingo after Legends: Arceus, especially given that it has now been nearly two years since the game’s release. Whether or not Ingo’s story has a happy ending, the frustration that comes with ambiguity is arguably worse than even the revelation of a heartbreaking conclusion. This will be especially true for Emmet, whose apparent own unawareness of what happened to his brother brings an especially tragic angle to the entire situation.

There are undoubtedly many people who wish to see Ingo reunited with Emmet, and the Legends: Arceus’ protagonist’s capture of Hisui’s Legendary Pokémon certainly make them capable of ensuring such a thing. Nevertheless, without the clarification that a future Pokémon game can bring, the truth will never come to light. In particular, Pokémon’s Gen 10 games offer plenty of opportunities to explain what happened to Ingo, and perhaps even feature his return to the franchise.
