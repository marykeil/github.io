## Literature Review

The Medium fits well on any team in The Finals. It is versatile and leans towards support, but can still contribute good damage with a good build.





The Medium class is the glue that will hold the rest of the team together. You often want to be close to at least one of your allies. If you instead feel like roaming the map solo, a stealthy Light class build would be a better fit.

 Supportive Medium Team Leader in The Finals 
          

The Medium class is all about adapting to the enemy and changing tactics. This fundamentally starts with selecting a Specialization, the main ability in The Finals. From there, Weapons and Gadgets tend to favor mid-range attacks and/or quickly moving around. Unlike the other two classes, Mediums have access to the best Gadgets in The Finals that can easily help the rest of the team or hamper the opponent.



You can also assign a Reserve loadout for both Weapons and Gadgets. This allows you to switch between two guns and six devices. However, this can only be done after being killed and waiting for a respawn.







 Ability Name  Ability Type  Function   Healing Beam  Specialization  Heal an ally within a short distance. Recovers 25 damage per second. Great for keeping a Heavy build alive.   Recon Senses  Specialization  Highlights all enemies through walls and other obstacles.   AKM  Weapon  Fast rate of fire assault rifle. Holds 36 rounds per magazine.   R 357  Weapon  Very high damage revolver that packs heavy recoil. Holds 6 rounds per magazine.   Jump Pad  Gadget  Places down a pad that allows allies to soar through the air. Great for reaching roofs or escaping.   



 Ability Name  Ability Type  Function   APS Turret  Gadget  A small turret that will destroy enemy grenades and rockets but does not target humans.   Zipline  Gadget  Quickly travel vertically or horizontally over the map. Most stages in The Finals are designed for this item.   Defibrillator  Gadget  Quickly resurrects an ally, but with less health than a standard five-second revive.   Goo Grenade  Gadget  Creates hardened goo piles that block areas and can be climbed on.   Gas Grenade  Gadget  Creates a cloud of deadly gas that harms enemies over time. The gas is instantly destroyed by fire.   





Healing Beam is the better option for most team setups. Recon Senses should be deployed for a two-Medium player team or if you are already toppling the enemy. Jump Pad, Defibrillator, and Goo Grenade are safer as main gadgets, with the others going into Reserve. But, always switch accordingly.







The Medium is the best line of defense for helping allies in The Finals. While the AKM and R 357 will produce a fair amount of damage, the biggest contribution is allowing both allies to be much more aggressive. Stay close by, and you will have a strong and formidable setup.
