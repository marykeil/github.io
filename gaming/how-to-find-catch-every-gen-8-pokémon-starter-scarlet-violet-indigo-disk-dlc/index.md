## Literature Review

All starters have been added to Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC, including the Gen 8 Sun &amp; Moon starters, Grookey, Scorbunny, &amp; Sobble.





Unfortunately, though every previous generation&#39;s starter Pokémon has been added to the Indigo Disk DLC Pokédex, none will be available from the start. Instead, players will need to progress in the game, specifically in earning BP, which unlocks all Pokémon starters.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Every Gen 3 Pokémon Starter in Indigo Disk DLC   Starter Pokémon have arrived with the Indigo Disk DLC, including the Treeko, Torchic, and Mudkip from the Gen 3 Ruby, Sapphire, &amp; Emerald games.   


 How To Unlock Gen 8 Starters 
          

After players have been introduced to the League Club at Blueberry Academy, Drayton will also introduce the computer in the club room. This is where players can spend BP that is earned in the terrarium. To unlock the starters, players will need to upgrade each biome individually at 3,000 BP each or 12,000 BP. BP can be either earned through finishing BBQs or battling. For BBQs, press the right D-pad button to open the quest log and view the three available tasks. Once one is completed, another will replace it.

As for the battle itself, it will only reward money, not BP. However, once a certain number of trainers in the area have been battled, speak with the woman standing near the major recovery spots in each biome, and she will reward BP. Be sure to talk to her repeatedly, as she will reward BP several times for different amounts of defeated trainers within the area. Though this rewards more BP, it can take longer than simply completing BBQs.






While BBQs seem tedious, since each may only reward 20-40 BP on average, there is a way to speed things up. For those who can, playing with friends will increase the available BBQs for everyone.




Additionally, everyone may participate in completing any of them. This means that BBQs can be completed at a rapid-fire pace, plus the group will also have the opportunity to complete Group Quests, which offer significantly more BP.



 Where To Find &amp; Catch Sobble, Scorbunny, &amp; Grookey 
         

Once enough BP has been earned, the correct Biomes from the Indigo Disk DLC&#39;s new map will need to be upgraded. Each biome upgrade will only unlock 6 Pokémon starters specific to that biome, and no biome includes all three starters from one generation, so multiple biomes will need to be upgraded to get all the Sun &amp; Moon starters. For Grookey, the Coastal Biome must be upgraded. For Sobble, the Savanah Biome must be upgraded. Finally, for Scorbunny, the Polar Biome must be upgraded.




Once unlocked, each Pokémon will have a specific area in the biome where they can be found, with some being harder to track down than others. For example, Scorbunny can spawn over most of the Polar Biome, while Sobble only spawns in a few particular spots in the Savanah Biome with mud. As for Grookey, the easiest place to look is near the wall where the Savanah connects to the coastal beach along the outer rim. Once each has been caught, don&#39;t forget to evolve them to fill out your Pokémon Scarlet &amp; VioletIndigo Disk DLC Pokédex.
