# James Gunn s DCU Video Games Are Coming At The Best - And Worst - Time


## SUMMARY 



  DCU games will be AAA ventures, not just movie tie-ins, according to James Gunn.   The DCU games may enter a tired superhero market, facing genre fatigue and a waning interest in superhero content.   Tying games into a connected universe risks rushed releases and creative limitations, but DCU games should find a unique competitive angle against the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series.

## Literature Review

There are reasons to be optimistic about the future of DC Universe games, but it&#39;s also going to be an uphill battle in some major regards.




The upcoming DC Universe media franchise helmed by James Gunn is going to include more than just movies, and the development of video games within the DCU sphere is coming at a particularly interesting time. DC already has a long history of video game adaptations, from the widely mocked Superman 64 to the celebrated Batman: Arkham titles. Considering the lack of any major games set in the recently concluded DC Extended Universe, there&#39;s not much precedent for the venture into DCU games, raising a lot of interesting questions about what the slate will look like.




The confirmation that games are currently in development comes directly from James Gunn, who gave only the briefest insight into what kind of DCU titles are being planned. The most significant clarification he offers is that the DCU titles will be AAA ventures, not just movie tie-ins. This should make the DCU games competitive with alternatives like the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series in theory, although what ultimately comes of the venture in practice remains to be seen.

                  James Gunn Says New DC Games Will Be Connected To The DCU   DC Studios CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s plans for the DC Universe will be connected across multiple forms of media, including video games.   


 DCU Games Will Be Entering A Tired Superhero Market 
          

Video game development is typically a long affair, so it&#39;s unlikely that the DCU games confirmed to be on the way by James Gunn via his Threads account will be hitting store shelves anytime soon. Unless there&#39;s a big market revitalization in the near future, however, they&#39;re unlikely to arrive in a context that&#39;s as receptive to superhero content as it was just a few years ago. With a few notable exceptions, genre fatigue has been hitting hard at the box office. The enormous fall in profits from the first Aquaman movie to its sequel is one major DC example of this waning relevance, and slapping a familiar superhero character on a product is no longer a reasonably sure method of guaranteeing success.




Superheroes aren&#39;t quite as oversaturated in modern video games as they are in movies, so the fatigue may not apply in quite the same way. Specifically attaching upcoming games to a film-oriented DCU umbrella, however, runs the risk of incurring a similarly disinterested reaction. There&#39;s some hope that the DCU will be able to reboot interest in DC&#39;s properties – and the sense that the wheels were coming off of the DCEU venture is certainly a major contributing factor to the lack of recent box office success – but it could still be something of an uphill battle.

                  Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Release Date, Characters, &amp; Gameplay   After several delays, Suicide Squad: KTJL will return to the Arkhamverse as Task Force X takes on mind-controlled members of the Justice League.   



 A Connected Universe Might Be Bad For DC Games 
          




Extending the idea of a connected universe to video games might also just be a bad idea in general. Although the Marvel Cinematic Universe saw a more consistently positive reception than the DCEU during its height, it&#39;s also suffered from waning interest, thanks in part to the exhausting demands for following continuity. Having to watch a streaming series to understand the context of a movie is a tall order, and the endeavor can start to feel pointless when the movie ends up being little more than a set-up for something else.

Tying games into the same ecosystem risks the same wearisome sense of obligation while additionally posing some concerns for creative development. Fitting game development cycles into a narrative that&#39;s scheduled across multiple works could result in rushed releases, and the obligation to fit an overarching canon makes bold storytelling moves more difficult. The Batman: Arkham titles were only beholden to themselves, so every element could be tailor-made around what would best fit the experience of the games, rather than anything else.






 Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man Is An Interesting DCU Game Rival 
         

Although the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man games don&#39;t tie in to Spider-Man films outside some costumes and Easter eggs, they are in fact angling for an interconnected universe of their own. Marvel&#39;s Wolverine is set to expand the world in the near future, and recent leaks from developer Insomniac Games pointed to future X-Men games beyond that. Insomniac is playing its cards carefully, however, as Wolverine hasn&#39;t even had a cameo in the Spider-Man games. Keeping the development within one studio should also make communication and negotiation about plans easier than the kind of project that DCU games will seemingly be entering.

In many ways, the Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man series provides a standard for DCU games to aspire to, but they also need to find a unique competitive angle. It could be difficult to go head-to-head against anything as polished as Insomniac&#39;s titles, and few heroes have attributes as inherently fun to play with as Spider-Man&#39;s web-slinging. Recapturing the richer atmosphere and more eclectic appeal of Batman: Arkham could be the perfect way to do this, but if current impressions of problems in the upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, from the Batman: Arkham studio Rocksteady, are anything to go by, managing that may not be easy.






 DCU Games Might Still Be Coming At The Right Time 
          

Despite all the possible concerns, there are certainly some reasons to be optimistic about the future of DCU games. The lack of DCU or MCU movies releasing in 2024 should be a nice refresh for some of the general fatigue, so there may well be real excitement for titles once they&#39;re closer to release. With a lingering Wonder Woman title that&#39;s been in development for several years and the dubious attention surrounding Suicide Squad: KTJL, confirming a future of DCU games could also help restore some confidence that DC is properly investing in a sustainable future.



Another concern surrounding Suicide Squad: KTJL and future projects is the inclusion of live-service elements, which can often be detrimental to single-player gameplay experiences.







Although just how bright the future of superhero media is might still be unclear at the moment, there&#39;s no denying that it&#39;s in something of a transitional moment, and being poised to take advantage of any opportunities that come is probably the best way for the DCU to approach things. Whether DCU games can deliver great gameplay and strong stories remains to be seen, as does the market response to whatever they bring to the table. Wrapping James Gunn&#39;s DCU into the future of DC games has both significant benefits and drawbacks, and it should be interesting to see how everything turns out.
