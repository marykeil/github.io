## Literature Review

Alpha creatures and dinosaurs represent the most powerful beasts across the entire Island in ASA, but which one is the most powerful?




Alpha creatures represent the top food chain in Ark: Survival Ascended and act as the game&#39;s tougher creatures outside of the game&#39;s bosses like Broodmother or Megapithecus. Originally released in Ark: Survival Evolved to create a more difficult challenge, these apex predators have made their way to the new revamped ASA. While somewhat similar in appearance, Apex creatures look different than their generic counterparts, boasting red skin and being larger in size. But the creatures aren&#39;t just more visually fearsome; they are also much more challenging to take out with higher overall stats and more punishing attacks.
Similar to Evolved, Alpha creatures in ASA are not tameable, rideable, or breedable. What they do possess, however, is a good challenge, a nice chunk of XP, and exclusive loot, some of which is required to access the Tek Cave on Alpha difficulty. While not every Alpha in the numerous expansions and DLC for Ark: Survival Evolved has made its way to ASA, a decent amount of creatures are already in the game. Alphas remain somewhat rare to stumble across (especially the sea Alphas), which makes coming across one a great opportunity to gear up and take one out.
            
 
 10 Best Upcoming New Features In Ark: Survival Ascended 
Ark: Survival Ascended will slowly start to incorporate all the content from Evolved, but Studio Wildcard plans on taking things even further. 












 








 6  Alpha Raptor (Alpha Utahraptor Prime) 
Creature Type: Dinosaur
        

Though intimidating in their own right, the Alpha Raptor is just the tip of the iceberg regarding Alpha dinosaurs in Ark: Survival Ascended. Taking out one of these intimidating beasts will reward nearby players with a Rex Bone Helmet Skin as well as high-quality weapons, armor, items, and recipes. When harvested, Alpha Raptors drop Raw Prime Meat, Hide, and Alpha Raptor Claws. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Alpha Raptor is pretty tanky with a base health pool of 3,600, so taking one out will not be an easy task.
The Rex Bone Helmet Skin is just a cosmetic item that changes your helmet to a dinosaur skull and doesn&#39;t boast any stat bonuses. 






 5  Alpha Megalodon (Alpha Carcharodon Ultramegalodon) 
Creature Type: Fish
        

The Alpha Megalodon is one of the most iconic water-based creatures in the world, let alone in Ark. As its toothy appearance would indicate, this highly aggressive shark is capable of aggroing from a decent distance away, so proper care should be taken. Alphas typically are accompanied by a group of regular Megalodons, which should be taken out before the battle commences. That said, once one is located, it&#39;s usually easy enough to aggro it close enough to shore and slowly widdle down its fairly beefy 9,600 base health. Ultimately, taking out this beast is necessary to get the Alpha Megalodon Fin
            
 
 10 Coolest Ark: Survival Ascended Dinosaurs, Ranked 
There are so many dinos to choose from in Ark: Survival Ascended that figuring out which ones to tame can actually be pretty difficult. 








 4  Alpha Carnotaurus (Carnotaurus Pressor) 
Creature Type: Dinosaur
        

The Alpha Carnotaurus is more terrifying visually than it is actually to take out in Ark: Survival Ascended. Though frightening because of its size and aggression, the Alpha Carnotaurus has a relatively low (compared to some other Alphas) HP, with just 6,400 base health, making it one of the easier Alphas to attack and take out from range. This becomes easier when there are multiple people working together to take one out. The Alpha variation drops the Carnotaurus Arm, Raw Prime Meat, Keratin, and Hide. Like the Alpha Raptor, the Alpha Carnotaurus also drops the Rex Bone Helmet Skin.
            
 
 Ark: Survival Ascended DLC Roadmap - All Planned Expansions &amp; Updates 
Ark: Survival Ascended is a remastered Survival Evolved in Unreal Engine 5, and is expected to gradually include all of the originalâ€™s DLC expansions.








 3  Alpha Mosasaurus (Alpha Mosasaurus Suspirita) 
Creature Type: Reptile
        

Though Alpha Mosasaurus possess an enormous base health value of 54,000 and a powerful 200-damage base attack, low-level Alpha Mosasaurs are actually one of the easier Alpha predators to take out on The Island due to their limited swimming mechanics. High-level water mounts can help make the process easier, but the Alpha Mosasaur will perform an AOE attack on groups of creatures. Killing an Alpha Mosasaur is worth it, as it rewards an Alpha Mosasaur Tooth, 100 Black Pearls, and Fireworks Launcher Skin.
Mosasaurs are vulnerable to attack from above, so it&#39;s possible to resurface and attack with range continually, though it may require a lot of resources and time to widdle down its huge health pool. As always, it&#39;s best to approach Alphas with a Tribe. 






 2  Alpha T-Rex 
Creature Type: Dinosaur


 







Alpha T-Rex is so fearsome that it&#39;s virtually impossible to take down without a coordinated group. Only surpassed by the likes of a Giganotosaurus, the dinosaur possesses a base health of 17,500 and has a main attack that does 170 damage. Capable of taking out even larger groups that come unprepared, this terrifying beast lives up to its iconic name. Taking out the Alpha T-Rex rewards the Alpha Rex Trophy, Trike Bone Helmet Skin, and Alpha Tyrannosaur Tooth.
Attacking at range with a Quetzalcoatlus mount is a decent way to widdle down the health of the beefy Alpha T-Rex. 






 1  Alpha Tusoteuthis (Tusoteuthis Vampyrus) 
Creature Type: Invertebrate


 







The Alpha Tusoteuthis is one of the more fierce Alphas currently in ASA. With a massive amount of health at 30,000 HP and both a grab and crush ability, this Alpha can give even fully kitted high-level players a run for their money. Approaching an Alpha Tusoteuthis should be done from afar, though nuking it down when it reaches low health is incredibly important. One should not take on this Alpha alone, as a group of well-suited high-level characters will be required to take one out. The Alpha Tusoteuthis drops the Alpha Tusoteuthis Eye, Tusoteuthis Tentacle, Absorbent Substrate, and Black Pearls.
Ultimately, while challenging to overcome, Alpha creatures in Ark: Survival Ascended are critical in advancing toward the game&#39;s later stages, where taking on the Tek Cave on Alpha difficulty is required to level up to the max level of 135 in the game. Before taking one on, a person should gather up any remaining tribe members and coordinate and plan an attack. Even the lowest-level Alpha creature on The Island is a formidable beast, especially for those that aren&#39;t a high enough level or don&#39;t have the best gear.
