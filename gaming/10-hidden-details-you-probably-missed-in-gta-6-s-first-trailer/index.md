## Literature Review

There was a ton that was packed in the minute-and-a-half Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer — so much so that there might be a few details you missed. 




Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s first trailer, though only a mere minute-and-a-half, has so much content packed inside of it people across the world have been combing every frame for hidden details on what people can expect when GTA 6 releases in 2025. From viral moments to new vehicles obtainable, paying close attention to every second of the official trailer is actually much more revealing than the multitude of GTA 6 leaks and rumors over the past few years.
            
 
 GTA 6&#39;s Setting &amp; Location: Everything We Know About Leonida &amp; Vice City 
GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. Drawing on the trailer, the original Vice City, and its real world basis, here’s what to expect from GTA 6’s map.



Though one could wildly speculate on the features and mechanics found within the game based on the short clip, it&#39;s not even necessary, as there are more obvious confirmed features and details that can be gleaned from the footage. Finding these details, however, might take a keen eye or pausing the video in order to find them.
            
 
 GTA 6 Trailer 1: Everything We Learned About Lucia 
GTA 6&#39;s first trailer offered a look at the game&#39;s Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo, Jason and Lucia as they embark on a crime spree through Leonida.












 








 10  Maverick Helicopters Featured In Trailer 
A Rockstar Post May Have Been A Hint


 







The Maverick Helicopter is an iconic GTA aircraft that first made its way into the franchise in GTA: Vice City. Since then, it&#39;s been featured in every iteration of GTA and was featured flying through the sky in the trailer. Though it might not be a surprise that it&#39;ll be returning in GTA 6, a 2022 Rockstar X (formerly Twitter) post for the holidays may have been hinting toward the location for the new game a year before the trailer even released via the Maverick Helicopter ornament found on the tree. There is also a Sea Sparrow that can be spotted in the trailer, another helicopter in the game introduced in Vice City.





 9  The GTA 6 Map Will Be Huge 
Kelly County, Keys, VCI Airport, And More
        

The GTA 6 trailer was filled to the brim with hints about future locations in the game. Mentioned or displayed locales include Vice Beaches, Port VC, Keys, VCI Airport, Kelly County, and the Vice City equivalent to the Everglades. There is also another location called Port Gellhorn, which can be briefly spotted as Lucia and her partner speed away.
            
 
 Everyone&#39;s Saying The Same Thing About GTA 6&#39;s Trailer 1 
GTA 6&#39;s first trailer showcased its Florida-inspired location and the eccentric citizens that inhabit it, with many comparing them to a popular meme.



Many of these locations were made available through scenes from the trailer themselves or by reading the road signs. Kelly County points to the fact that players will indeed get to explore outside of Vice City and into the larger state of Leonida, as well as the Keys, a series of small islands on the state&#39;s south coast.





 8  Some GTA 6 Vendors May Be Changing 
Ammu-Nation May Have Some Competition


 







Though Ammu-Nation has been the iconic hot spot for GTA characters to get guns and ammo for years, that might change with the new GTA 6. Featured speeding out of a parking lot, a store called Pawn &amp; Gun and Gun Pawn Shop can be seen right next to each other. While this doesn&#39;t confirm that Ammu-Nation locations won&#39;t be in the game, it does confirm there may be different vendors to get gear.
Similarly, for a brief moment in the car scene, several vendors can be seen on a giant mini-mall sign. Vendors may include stores like Kowalski (which may be a reference to the game Bully), Callus, Skala, and Alpha. These appear to be apparel shops but could really be anything since they show up on the screen for less than a second.





 7  Blue And Red Bandannas May Point To Gangs 
Old Enemies And Friends Return
        

Though it&#39;s easy to miss, the red and blue bandannas that characters in the trailer are seen wearing may be a reference to two of the largest original gangs in Vice City, the Haitians and the Cubans. While there&#39;s no confirmation that they&#39;ll be making a return to the title, it makes sense as they were big players in the original GTA: Vice City game. There&#39;s a chance that in GTA 6 the names of the gangs will change, but only time will tell.





 6  Several Real-Life Viral Moments 
Leonida Man Is Florida Man


 







The Florida man meme is resurging again, just as a result of the GTA 6 trailer. While it&#39;s obvious that a lot of the moments captured in the minute-and-a-half trailer are based loosely on true viral events, the amount of detail that went into replicating these moments is pretty impressive. In fact, there are several real-live viral references in the GTA 6 trailer. From a gator being fished from a pool to an out-of-control neighbor wielding two hammers, much of the trailer was based on reality.
            
 
 10 Real-Life Viral Moments Captured In The GTA 6 Trailer 
The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was packed with a ton of interesting scenes, some of which are based on viral real-life moments with a deeper story. 








 5  Several Real-Life Miami Locations 
Florida Keys, Wynwood, Panorama Tower
        

Though they only appear briefly throughout the trailer, for those living in the Miami-Dade area, it was already obvious that GTA 6 uses a lot of the actual buildings that exist in Miami. While this may have not been anything new, considering the leaks did spoil a lot of these details early, places like the Florida Keys, Heat Stadium, Wynwood, Miami Beach, and Panorama Tower can be seen in several shots throughout the trailer.





 4  Lucia Might Be The Woman In The Bikini 
A Serious Glow-Up
        

While it&#39;s still not totally confirmed, the woman striking a pose on a high-rise balcony may indeed be our protagonist, Lucia, albeit with a pretty significant makeover. With a side-by-side comparison, it can be seen that many of her features match up with the featured character earlier in the trailer, showing there&#39;s a chance for a real glow-up for our main character.





 3  Lucia Isn&#39;t Following Anyone On Social Media 
Is Doomscrolling A Thing?
        

One interesting concept is that the viral clips viewed throughout the trailer — the button remains on Follow, meaning that whoever is watching the clips is doomscrolling. This could mean more — as perhaps a way to gain missions or see what&#39;s going around in the city, though that hasn&#39;t been confirmed as of writing.





 2  T-Shirt Pokes Fun At COD 
Righteous Slaughter Blood Ops Confirmed For 2025
        

Righteous Slaughter 7 was a game featured in Grand Theft Auto 5 and is an obvious parody of Call of Duty. Briefly in the scene featured for the High Rollerz, a man can be seen wearing a Righteous Slaughter Blood Ops shirt, an obvious reference to the COD: Black Ops series of games. On the back of his truck, a decal for Sound 4 Sound can also be seen, which may be a reference to a new vendor in the game.





 1  NPC AI Will Be Vastly Improved 
More Realistic Encounters
        

The beach scene in the GTA 6 trailer was perhaps the most telling regarding the quality of NPC AI in the upcoming title. Characters on the beach can be seen doing a variety of different things, like putting on sun tan lotion, having conversations, and even taking photos without someone&#39;s consent.
In addition, it appears even animal AI will be improved in GTA 6, with birds perching on power lines and flying in formation and gators and birds interacting with the environment in Leonida&#39;s equivalent to the Everglades. Sharks and dolphins can also be seen swimming around in the water, marking their return to the game. While it&#39;s more than likely super fans of the franchise with a keen eye will spot more hidden details, these are some of the most significant findings for Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer 1.
Rockstar Games&#39; Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled for a 2025 release window.
