## Literature Review

Surviving in Dead By Daylight will take having a few good perks in order to counter the Killer’s terrible plans to stop players from escaping.




Survivors in Dead By Daylight have a plethora of Perks to choose from, each with its own pros and cons. Since new characters and abilities are released often the list of best Perks can change over time.
The meta of Dead By Daylight Perks has changed over the years, particularly with new scenarios, Survivors, and Killers joining the roster. Currently, there are 131 Survivor Perks in Dead By Daylight, which is a large number to sort through and determine which ones are best. However, some currently stand out among the rest in the current version of the game.
            
 
 10 Best Dead By Daylight Killers From Movies, Ranked 
Dead by Daylight features some of the horror genre&#39;s most iconic killers from the medium of movies. Though they are all terrifying, who is the best?



Please note, despite the numbers, these perks are not in any particular order and just represent some of the best perks to use when trying to escape the trials. 










 








 10  Dramaturgy 
Run Fast, Cause Chaos!


 







One of the newer Unique Survivor Perks in the game with the addition of the Nicolas Cage DLC in Dead By Daylight, this Perk plays into the meta and adds a hint of unpredictability to the game. This perk causes the Survivor to run for 0.5 seconds before gaining a &#43;25% Haste Status Effect with another effect.
The last effect is random, which could cause the Survivor to be Exposed, to have a longer Haste Effect, to Scream, or to receive a random rare item. The Perk’s downside is that it requires the Survivor to be healthy, but the Haste effect can be a huge benefit to sprint to an Exit Gate or evade a Killer.





 9  Lithe 
Vault &amp; Sprint!
        

Lithe is a Unique Perk to Feng, which gives the Survivor a chance to get away from the Killer. After performing a rushed vault, the Survivor will break into a sprint of 150% of their normal Running Movement speed for 3 seconds.
This will then give the Survivor an Exhausted Status Effect for 60/50/40 seconds, depending on the prestige of the Perk in Dead By Daylight. This can give the Survivor a needed burst to lose the Killer and find a place to lay low.
Lithe cannot be used while Exhausted. 








 8  Spine Chill 
Speed Up With This Sixth Sense.


 







This is a general Perk that activates whenever the Killer is within 36 meters of the Survivor and looking at them with a clear line of sight. This increases the Survivors action speed for Repairing, Healing, Sabotaging, Unhooking, Cleansing, Blessing, Opening, and Unlocking by 2-6% and lasts for 0.5 seconds after the Killer loses line of sight or exits the range.
Spine Chill can allow a Survivor to finish an important task before the Killer reaches them and potentially still have time to escape. 

            
 
 Dead By Daylight: 13 Tips To Be A Strategic Survivor 
It may be a fun asymmetrical horror game, but it is also challenging. Here are some Dead by Daylight tips for survivors.








 7  Prove Thyself 
Work Faster, Together!
        

This is a Unique Perk belonging to Dwight that increases the Survivor’s Repair speed by 6-10% for each other Survivor within 4 meters of that Survivor up to 18-30% and each Survivor in that range also receives the benefit of that Perk.
This can allow Survivors to repair Generators much faster when they are together which can give them a head start early in the game if used well before the Killer has a chance to reach them, as well as allowing them to finish them quicker as the match grows longer.





 6  Boon: Circle of Healing 
Heal, Heal, Heal!
        

Circle of Healing is a Unique Perk to Mikaela that allows Survivors to create a Boon Totem out of a Dull or Hex Totem by blessing it. This Boon creates a radius of 24 meters in which any Survivor inside the radius will have an increase of 50-100% to Altruistic Healing speeds when not using a Med-Kit, and any injured Survivor will have their Aura revealed to other Survivors. This allows Survivors to work better together and to help each other survive the night.
Ranges of percentages or duration of effects are based on the level of the Perk. Perks range from levels 1-3, which usually increases the effect of the Perk in question. 






 5  Sprint Burst 
Get A Boost of Speed.


 







Sprint Burst is another Unique Perk for Meg, which activates when a Survivor starts to run. As they do, they will break into a sprint at 150% of their normal Running Movement speed for 3 seconds. Afterward, the Survivor will be Exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds, but the burst of speed can give Survivors in Dead By Daylight enough time to reach an Exit Gate or evade a Killer.
Sprint Burst cannot be used while exhausted. 






 4  Kindred 
Show Your Teammates The Way.
        

Kindred is a general Perk that gives Survivors a boost to their Aura-spotting abilities depending on whether they or another Survivor is hooked. If they are hooked, the Auras of all Survivors are revealed to each other, and if a Killer is lingering within 8-16 meters of their hook, their Aura can be seen by all Survivors.
If another Survivor is hooked, a Survivor with Kindred can see the Aura of all other Survivors and the Killer’s as well if they are within 8-16 meters of the hooked Survivor. Knowing where other Survivors are is invaluable, and the additional Perk of seeing a lurking Killer is a great benefit.





 3  Adrenaline 
End-Game Energy Boost.
        

The Adrenaline Perk is another Unique Perk for Meg, which triggers in the endgame when the Exit Gates are powered on. It instantly heals the Survivor by one health State and grants a sprint bonus of 150% of the Survivor’s normal Running Movement speed for 5 seconds.
If disabled, Adrenaline will activate if the Survivor is freed, and will wake players from the Dream World if playing against the Nightmare. It will give the player an Exhausted Status Effect for 60/50/40 seconds afterward.







 2  Made for This 
Injuries Create Haste.
        

One of Gabriel’s Unique Perks, Made for This will activate whenever the Survivor is in the Injured State. It will grant the Survivor a 1-3% Haste Status Effect while running and the Endurance Status Effect for 6-10 seconds after completing a Healing action on another Survivor.
It cannot be used while Exhausted, but unlike other similar Perks, it does not cause Exhaustion. This can allow Injured Survivors to outrun the Killer and give them a boost for helping someone else instead of themselves adding to the teamwork aspect of Dead By Daylight.





 1  Off the Record 
Stay Quiet After Being Saved.
        

This is a Unique Perk for Zarina, which favors a stealthy Survivor build in Dead By Daylight. After being unhooked by another Survivor or yourself, this Perk activates for the next 60-80 seconds. It prevents the Killer from revealing the Survivor’s Aura and suppresses Grunts of Pain, as well as giving the Survivor the Endurance effect.
This gives players time to creep away from the Killer and reset. It will deactivate if the Exit Gates are powered, at which point it will pay to be faster as opposed to sneaky.
