## Literature Review

The massive map of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be difficult to navigate without fast travel, which you unlock by breaking rifts in time.





One of the reasons why fast travel is so important comes from how Prince of Persia: TLC&#39;s modern Metroidvania map works. While you can recover health at Wak-Wak Trees scattered commonly throughout regions, you are unable to move between these rest stops. As a result, you often have to travel all the way back to safe areas like The Haven hub on foot, and past waves of enemies in different rooms.






Resting at a Wak-Wak Tree resets all the enemies in an area. If you defeated a group of foes in a room before, they will respawn the moment you choose to recover Sargon&#39;s health and other resources.





 How to Find Fast Travel Spots in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown 
          

The best way to find fast travel spots is to look for the purple distortion of your screen as you explore to discover Pegasus Statues on your map. When you&#39;re trying to repair the goddess statue in the Lower City, you&#39;ll end up breaking small purple orbs that represent rifts in space and time. Destroying these repairs different structures, and allows you to reach new parts of the world in Prince of Persia: TLC.



You may see a place where you can fast travel in The Haven hub within the Lower City at first, but this point is blocked by a gate until you find another one in a different region.







While some of these rifts are reserved only for pursuit of the main story, you may see the same purple distortion as you travel to unexplored areas. Reaching the Scholar&#39;s Archive region for the first time is usually where you might notice this UI change in Prince of Persia: TLC. A fast travel point can be found pretty early in this area, but you have to defeat some enemies past a few rooms on this zone&#39;s left path.

Keep following the distortion until it leads you to a statue, then break the orb that is keeping the structure destroyed at a fixed point in time. This will likely create your first fast travel point on the map and lets you travel back to The Haven&#39;s complete Pegasus Statue. From here, you may open the gate that blocked off The Haven&#39;s fast travel spot in Prince of Persia: TLC.




Showing inspiration from Ori and the Will of the Wisps, this fast travel system gives you more freedom to explore areas in this game&#39;s Metroidvania map without the tedium of backtracking to different regions. You&#39;ll find more Pegasus Statues as you progress through Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and unlock more spots to fast travel between as you discover more and more areas.
