## Literature Review

Eternity is a main DPS in Reverse 1999 who loses HP whenever she casts an Incantation. However, she is a shockingly sturdy and reliable DPS.





At Insight One, Eternity is immune to Blood, Poison, and Corrode statuses. At the start of a round, she gets a stack of Blood of Longevity, boosting her DMG Dealt and DMG Heal. This immunity, along with her debuff Incantation and steady DMG potential, makes her an excellent match for teams with steady healers, weak enemy bonuses, and debuff perks.




                  Reverse 1999: The Best X Build (Psychubes &amp; Team Comp)   X is a solid dispeller and crowd controller character in Reverse 1999. His best builds play on his debuffs and encourage teams that weaken enemies.   


 The Best Psychubes For Eternity 
          

Since Eternity is a main DPS in Reverse 1999, she will often be the one to deal with the killing blow against enemies. As such, Hopscotch fits into her kit well, building up to an explosive and beneficial Ultimate. If Hopscotch gets to Level 60, it gives Eternity an 18% Incantation Might bonus. Meanwhile, for each enemy Eternity manages to defeat, she will get one stack of up to &#43;8% Ultimate Might. She can get up to four stacks at any one time. This improves the DMG Dealt by Odd Story in Exeter and boosts her Leech Rate.






Because Eternity has a lot of resources to make up for the HP drain in her Incantations, it&#39;s better to support her DMG output. As Reverse 1999 comes out with more Psychubes, look for Psychubes that support Eternity&#39;s Ultimate, Odd Story In Exeter.




If you want more Ultimate Might faster, Brave New World won&#39;t be wasted on Eternity. This Psychube has an 18% Ultimate Might bonus for further DMG and Leech Rate potential. Once Eternity utilizes this bonus, the next Incantation gets up to 40% more Incantation Might. Antique Fan is the better Incantation to use following Odd Story in Exeter, as it needs a bonus more than Purse of Vigor and targets two enemies rather than one.

His Bounden Duty is useful for Eternity builds that need more healing than her Leech Rate or DMG Heal can provide. If Eternity defeats an enemy with His Bounden Duty equipped, she can heal by up to 120% of her ATK. Most notably, however, His Bounden Duty has a 12% general DMG bonus, so all of Eternity&#39;s attacks can benefit. If that still has yet to win you, this Psychube has a respectable ATK and HP boost for all of Eternity&#39;s needs.




If you can&#39;t find a good 6-Star Psychube for Eternity in Reverse 1999, you can always pair her with Yearning Desire, a 5-Star Psychube with an Amplification based on debuffs. Yearning Desire gives up to a 16% DMG bonus if the attack target has lowered stats or a Negative Status. Purse of Vigor can give an enemy Nasty Wound for one round, fulfilling Yearning Desire&#39;s requirement. Eternity&#39;s best team comps have many debuff options, making it easier to trigger this Psychube. Otherwise, Eternity can always use the 15% Incantation Might bonus.



 The Best Team Compositions For Eternity 
         

Eternity&#39;s best team comps in Reverse 1999 are Reality DMG-centric buff/debuff teams. Most of her best companions have debuff abilities to support her if she needs to use Yearning Desire. These debuffs provide excellent buffer room to help Eternity recover from her Incantations while the buffs add to her Insight bonuses.




An-an Lee is one of the best characters in Reverse 1999, acting as a top-tier secondary DPS with a potent buff, Incantation. An-an&#39;s buff increases DMG and reduces DMG Taken for all allies for two rounds. She has a solid single-target attack that can inflict Daze when the Incantation is at three stars.



When An-an Lee casts her Ultimate, she gets a special status that gives one of her Incantations a random star. She&#39;s a great DPS to support Eternity&#39;s DMG.




If you don&#39;t have An-an Lee, you can replace her with Reverse 1999&#39;s Bkornblume. She weakens enemies to Reality DMG and gets a DMG bonus when she attacks a weakened enemy. This Incantation triggers through lowered stats, Negative Statuses, or Control statuses, making it easy to apply in debuff-centric teams. If you have Eternity, use Purse of Vigor. Bkornblume can follow it up with Watch Your Sleeves.

There&#39;s a good chance you don&#39;t have An-an or Bkornblume. If that&#39;s the case, you should get along well with the F2P Sonetto in Reverse 1999. Sonetto can not only buff her allies, but when her attack Incantation, Commandment V, has at least two stars, she can apply Disarm to enemies. She gets a DMG and Penetration Rate bonus in her Ultimate if she has her stats boosted or otherwise has a Positive Status.




When looking for a healer, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with Medicine Pocket. They won&#39;t work with Bkornblume, as they deal Mental DMG, but they are not only an excellent healer but have both buff and debuff abilities. Their healing Incantation applies Sturdiness to all allies, while their debuff Incantation increases their target&#39;s DMG taken. Both of these skills synergize well with Eternity&#39;s kit. Medicine Pocket&#39;s top-notch healing will keep Eternity alive as her Incantations eat at her HP.

If you don&#39;t have Medicine Pocket or want a healer compatible with Bkornblume, you can pair Eternity with Balloon Party. She heals based on a percentage of lost HP, which means you will have to wait to heal Eternity until she is closer to defeat. Try to trigger Balloon Party&#39;s Ultimate often, as she&#39;ll give her team positive balloon-based statuses.

Eternity&#39;s play style may not suit all players, as she requires consistent HP monitoring. However, she can be an excellent F2P main DPS option if you&#39;re lucky. She&#39;s easy to build and great to use against whatever Reverse 1999 has to throw at you.
