## Literature Review

Even if Baldur’s Gate 3 is a fictional story set in a world of fantasy, there are many lessons that can be learned and applied to real life.




While it is set in a high fantasy world, there are several lessons in Baldur’s Gate 3 that apply to real life. Even with its foot in a magical fantasy land, the popular CRPG by Larian Studios is grounded when it comes to emotional storytelling and a narrative that revolves around unlikely compatriots bonding in a collective mission to save themselves and, eventually, the entirety of the Sword Coast. Of course, the game is also dictated by the player’s freedom of choice, as they can opt to be good, evil, or something in between.
This article contains some spoilers for Baldur’s Gate 3.
There are many tiny decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 that have huge story consequences and, with each step taken into the world of the game, players can learn more about the characters, their personalities, and much more. Throughout the title, players will be taught several lessons, many of which apply to real life, such as the importance of taking some time to look at the world around them or perhaps cautionary tales about not getting involved with certain individuals.




























 








 10  Don&#39;t Hyperfocus On Your Main Quest 
You May Miss Out On Great Stories &amp; Rewards
        

One of the main lessons taught by Baldur’s Gate 3 is that players should not hyperfocus only on the main mission of removing the tadpole from their heads. Instead, they should sidetrack and complete side quests. Some of the best stories and rewards actually lie on the path less taken.
Getting Nyrulna in Baldur’s Gate 3, also known as the best Legendary weapon in the game, involves participating in a short optional activity rather than going after the big villains, for instance. Players can learn more about their allies and connect with them if they spare the time for it, and that is much more precious than simply trying to save oneself from doom.





 9  Racism Is Always Evil 
Prejudices Need To Be Left Aside
        

While it may seem unbelievable that this needs to be stated, racism is always evil, and Baldur’s Gate 3 makes that abundantly apparent. Players should know this by now, but the game makes sure that aligning the gameplay to such an immoral standard is met with an equally evil campaign. Racial tensions are a common topic in high fantasy games, and bioessentialism needs to be thought over when applying this to products.
Goblins are often on the receiving end of racial hate simply due to the fact that they are goblins, for instance. Nevertheless, having characters like True Soul Nere and Minthara in Baldur’s Gate 3 being openly vile in addition to their twisted racial views adds to the argument that racism is indisputably evil in itself. Shadowheart is an evil character until she gets rid of her hate for githyanki. There is no middle ground.





 8  Emotional Responsibility Is Key 
Gale Needs To Get Over His Ex Before A New Relationship
        

Emotional responsibility is key both in Baldur’s Gate 3 and in real life, and the prime example of that is Gale. The Wizard is one of the player’s companions and possible love interests, but his attachment to his former love, Mystra, has him acting very poorly around others. It seems like his emotional wounds and prior romantic expectations are laid upon the player, which makes him come on strong and, often, a bit aggressive.
There are problems in romancing Gale in Baldur’s Gate 3, and showing any type of interest in him makes him create all sorts of future narratives in his head. It just comes to show that, if he is not yet over his ex-lover, he should take some time for himself, heal, and then think about getting back out there – even if time is limited with a tadpole in his head.





 7  Share The Load 
You Don’t Need To Carry The Weight Of The World On Your Shoulders
        

Although it is not explicitly stated, one of the best lessons in the game is that players should not carry the weight of the world on their own shoulders. Instead, they should share the load with those they trust. This goes from the fear of transformation via tadpole infection to simple inventory management.
If players carry too many items, they will become over-encumbered, which will then affect them negatively. They should spread out their loot with other companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, so as to bear the load and be able to move around. Keeping everything to oneself is never a healthy decision, and that can be interpreted by the game’s story and mechanics alike.





 6  Things Will Go Wrong (&amp; That&#39;s Okay) 
Live In The Moment
        

While planning in advance is always a good idea, doing that in an obsessive manner can be quite harmful. Baldur’s Gate 3 points out on multiple occasions that things will go wrong, and that when they are supposed to derail, there is not much anyone can do about it. One of the best examples is by helping the tieflings in Act 1. Their story at that moment ends with a message of hope.
Nevertheless, players discover later that their expedition toward the city went terribly wrong, and most of tieflings in the group were killed. It is heartbreaking, but there was nothing that players could have done to avoid it. They gave the group of poorly mistreated tiefling refugees a fighting chance and are there to help them again when they need it, but nothing can stop plans from going haywire.





 5  You Shouldn’t Blindly Follow Anything 
Pure Devotion Often Leads To Bad Decisions


 







One of the main lessons in Baldur’s Gate 3 is that pure devotion is not really beneficial, and players should have some self-inspired critical thinking when it comes to the circumstances presented to them. There are two grand examples of this in the game: Shadowheart’s faith in Shar and Lae’zel’s servitude to Vlaakith. Both of these companions blindly follow the orders given to them by those they admire deeply, and both deities are deceiving them and using them as puppets.
Shar kidnapped Shadowheart and erased her memories to create a loyal and powerful servant, while Vlaakith weaved a false tale to glorify herself, having Lae’zel act as her ever-faithful servant. Both Shar and Vlaakith are evil, and Shadowheart and Lae’zel are in conundrums created by their own unwavering faiths.





 4  Animals Have Feelings 
Speak With Animals Proves There Is More Than Meets The Eye
        

Animals have feelings and thoughts, even if not as elaborate as those presented in the game. Talking to animals in Baldur’s Gate 3 offers players further insight into these creatures’ behaviors and how they relate to the surrounding environment. It also serves as a reminder to be gentle to them, because they are almost always simply trying to survive or have some level of comfort.
One of the best examples of this is when approaching the bluejay on the outskirts of the Rosymorn Monastery. This small little bird simply wants to live in peace – even if they are suggesting the death of the peace-seeking eagles nesting on the roof. Outside the game, players should treat animals with love and respect, for that is all they seek.





 3  With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility 
It Is Easy To Become Ruthless When Enabled By Great Powers


 







Time and again, Baldur’s Gate 3 shows that the more power that players have, the greater the responsibility they undertake. If they are the only ones capable of helping the tiefling refugees, that is their moral responsibility, especially in good-aligned playthroughs. If players do not use their powers for the greater good, then they have been corrupted by it.
Power is a great corrupting force in real life and this is greatly exemplified in the game. The Chosen of the Dead Three have a significant amount of power, but they use it for their own selfish needs. Consequently, this ends up coming at a price: the lives and well-being of innocents who are not in a place to fight back against it.





 2  Do Not Judge A Book By Its Cover 
Many First Appearances Are Deceiving
        

There are many first impressions left by characters in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are later debunked, proving that players should never judge a book by its cover. One of the greatest examples is Lae’zel, who comes across as a fierce and rather rude partner, but ends up becoming part of one of the greatest and most emotionally invested scenes in the entire game. She also has one of the most heart-warming romances.
In an opposite comparison, there is an Act 3 character called Arfur. This man seems somewhat decent during his initial interaction, but later on, players discover that he is manufacturing bombs to kill innocent refugee children. That is absurdly inhumane, even if he was forced to do so. Arfur may not be as comically evil as Gortash or Orin, but he is certainly vile, showing that his first impression is much better than what he actually is.





 1  Never Strike A Deal With The Devil 
You Should Always Read Terms &amp; Clauses


 







Devils and cambions like Mizora and Raphael in Baldur’s Gate 3 prove that players should never strike a deal with the devil and, most importantly, always read the terms and clauses of any contracts they do end up signing. While there are no such creatures in real life, there are opportunists who try to take advantage of those in some sort of need. Before agreeing to something for anything else in return, players should make sure there is no fine line in a contract and, if there is, if they are acceptable.
Wyll believes he can be free of servitude, but a part of his contract says that can happen in up to six months. Raphael leads players to believe Yurgir is a threat, but he actually wants the orthon back in his House of Hope. There is much to learn from Baldur’s Gate 3, and some of the lessons are uncanny due to how close they resemble real life.
