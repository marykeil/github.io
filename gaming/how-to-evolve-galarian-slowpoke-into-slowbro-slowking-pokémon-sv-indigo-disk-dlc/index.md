## Literature Review

Galarian Slowbro has been re-introduced in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet via the Indigo Disk DLC, but evolving it will require hunting on the beaches.





To be able to get the Galarian poison-type versions of Slowbro and Slowking, players will need first to track down the Galarian Slowpoke, who will only be found in the Indigo Disk DLC Coastal Biome of terrarium. Galarian Slowpoke can usually be found along one of the beaches in the sand.






Normal Slowpoke will not be able to evolve into the Galarian versions of Slowbro and Slowking, even if using the method below. Only Galarian Slowpoke will evolve into these versions. The easiest way to tell them apart in your boxes is the coloring. Normal Slowpokes will have an overall pink appearance, while Galarian Slowpokes can be identified by the yellow markings on their heads and tails. Galarian Slowpoke will not be found outside the Indigo Disk DLC areas.

The best place to look for Galarian Slowpoke is on the beach directly behind Lacey&#39;s stage in the Coastal Biome in the Indigo Disk DLC. Lacey is one of the Indigo Disk DLC BB Elite Four members, specifically the Fairy one, and her stage can be spotted easily on the map in the center of the Coastal Biome.

On the small beach behind her, there should be an abundance of Galarian Slowpokes to choose from, but there is also one more item to look for down there, Galarica Twigs.



If you are looking to get both evolutions of Galarian Slowpoke for the Pokédex, you will need to catch two of them. This is not a linear evolutionary line, it is a split evolution. This means Galarian Slowpoke evolves into either Galarian Slowbro or Galarian Slowking. So, players will need two Galarian Slowpokes to evolve each one into different evolutionary forms.







Galarica Twigs are items that should also be abundant on this same stretch of sand and will appear as a little item sparkle on the ground. Be sure to pick up as many as possible because they will be necessary for evolving the Galarian Slowpoke. With at least eighteen in hand, head to the front of Lacey&#39;s stage, and right behind the check-in desk there will be a girl off to the left, near the vending machines. Speak with her, and she will offer to turn the Galarica Twigs into either a Galarica Cuff or Galarica Wreath.

                  Every New Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Indigo Disk DLC, Ranked   The new Pokémon in The Indigo Disk DLC are generally strong, but some come out ahead of others when all attributes are taken into consideration.   

Players will need both the Galarica Cuff and Wreath to get both of the Galarian Slowpoke evolutions. The Galarica Cuff will cost eight Galarica Twigs and the Galarica Wreath will cost fifteen Galarica Twigs. Have her make both and then switch both of your Galarian Slowpokes into your party. Once they&#39;re there, give one the Galarica Cuff and the other the Galarica Wreath, and this should trigger their respective evolutions.




The Galarica Cuff will evolve Galarian Slowpoke into the Galarian Slowbro, while the Galarica Wreath will cause Galarian Slowpoke to evolve into Galarian Slowking. Once that is complete, both of these evolutions should be registered and players can enjoy their new Pokémon. Keep in mind that Galarian Slowpoke and its evolutions are Poison/Psychic typing and not Water/Psychic like the original Slowpoke in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.
