## Literature Review

November 24th’s Wordle answer isn’t the hardest to solve; however, players might need to use hints at some point if they aren’t cautious.





Since Wordle’s hard mode is now being suggested to users by the game, you can try to solve today’s answer using this mode. The harder mode is known to be time-consuming, but it does help in developing skills that you can use in the regular mode. As you won’t be allowed to reuse confirmed letters in random spots, the chances of solving the answer increase. But there might be a point where you might need help if you are stuck on your last two attempts.
