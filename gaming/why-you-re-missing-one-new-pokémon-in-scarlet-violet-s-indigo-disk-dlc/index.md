# Why You re Missing One New Pokémon In Scarlet &amp; Violet s Indigo Disk DLC


## SUMMARY

The DLC takes players to Blueberry Academy, an underwater school with different biomes and diverse Pokémon.   Pecharunt, a new Ghost/Poison-type Pokémon, is not currently available in the DLC but will be introduced through an event in the future.

## Literature Review

With one elusive final Pokémon to go, there&#39;s still an extra stretch for completionists before passing the finish line of The Indigo Disk DLC.




The Indigo Disk DLC introduces a solid variety of new Pokémon to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but it&#39;s not actually possible to get every Pokémon that will join the Pokédex quite yet. As the second half of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, a two-part expansion that started with The Teal Mask earlier in 2023, The Indigo Disk packs in more content for a proper finale. At the moment, however, the number of accessible new Pokémon is identical to The Teal Mask despite a larger environment, longer runtime, and more challenging battles.




The story of The Indigo Disk takes trainers to Blueberry Academy, a school set in the middle of the ocean with a principally underwater campus. A wide selection of Pokémon can be found within thanks to the Terarium, a large The Indigo Disk map divided into four quadrants with different biomes. From the offensive juggernaut Iron Boulder to the headlining Terapagos, the new Indigo Disk Pokémon currently available do cover a fair share of ground with mostly excellent performance in battle. One that could be a game-changer, however, hasn&#39;t yet appeared.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   


 The Pecharunt Event Isn&#39;t In The Indigo Disk DLC Yet 
          




The missing Pokémon is Pecharunt, which has been revealed to be in The Indigo Disk through datamining. As a Mythical Pokémon, Pecharunt is set to be made available through an event rather than being accessible at launch like the other additions to the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC. Accessing Pecharunt will require a specific item interaction that opens up an epilogue, adding an extra bit of material themed around the new Mythical Pokémon to the ending of The Indigo Disk and the overall experience of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.



 Pecharunt Is A Ghost/Poison-Type Pokémon 
          

Up until this point, the only Ghost/Poison-type has been Gengar&#39;s evolutionary line, an exclusive pairing originally introduced in Generation 1 that has managed to persist all the way to Gen 9. Pecharunt appears to finally be muscling in on that territory as a new Ghost/Poison-type, although it&#39;s shifting gears to a more defensive focus instead of offensive. Just how effective and versatile Pecharunt proves to be in battle won&#39;t be obvious until the epilogue is actually made available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s The Indigo Disk DLC, but it&#39;s an interesting shake-up regardless.




It&#39;s a bit of a tease that Pecharunt can&#39;t yet be caught in The Indigo Disk, and it&#39;s not yet clear when exactly the event will become available. The early months of 2024 seem like a reasonable bet, however, so it&#39;s unlikely that the wait will be especially long. For now, it&#39;s still possible to complete the Pokédex according to the game&#39;s current roster of new The Indigo Disk Pokémon, just with the knowledge that the number will expand in the future. The Indigo Disk hasn&#39;t yet capped off its additions to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and Pecharunt has the potential to be a proper grand finale.
