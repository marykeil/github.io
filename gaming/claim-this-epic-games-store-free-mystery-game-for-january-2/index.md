## Literature Review

The Epic Games Store is continuing its holiday celebration with yet another free game giveaway on January 2, this time a roguelite shoot &#39;em up.




The Epic Games Store is giving away 20 Minutes Till Dawn as part of its holiday celebration on January 2, 2024. The game will be completely free through the Epic Games Store until 11:00 AM ET on January 3, 2023, when another free game will become available instead.




The Epic Games Store&#39;s holiday celebration began on December 20, 2023, and continues through to January 4, 2024.

 20 Minutes Till Dawn Is Free From Epic Games Store On January 2 
The Roguelite Survival Shooter Will Be Free Until January 3
          

20 Minutes Till Dawn is a 2022 survival roguelite shooter game by the developer Flanne. The title has similar gameplay to Vampire Survivors and Brotato, with players making their own builds each game by combining different abilities and artifacts to create an almighty character in an attempt to fend off endless hordes of Lovecraftian creatures and survive the night.




Epic Games Store has offered its players a wide range of titles as part of its holiday celebration, with a great mix of different genres included, from the puzzle-solving adventure title, Snakebird Complete to the racing game, Art of Rally. Several of these titles have been fairly new releases, with 2022&#39;s Ghostwire: Tokyo and 2019&#39;s The Outer Worlds being available on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and 2022&#39;s Saints Row and 2020&#39;s Ghostrunner being available on December 30, and New Year&#39;s Eve, respectively. There have also been some classic titles, such as Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition, which was available on December 23.

Each of the titles included in the holiday celebration so far are as follows:

 Date  Free EGS Game   December 20, 2023  DNF Duel   December 21, 2023  Melvor Idle   December 22, 2023  Art of Rally   December 23, 2023  Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition   December 24, 2023  Ghostwire: Tokyo   December 25, 2023  The Outer Worlds   December 26, 2023  Human Resource Machine   December 27, 2023  Cursed to Golf   December 28, 2023  Cat Quest   December 29, 2023  Snakebird Complete   December 30, 2023  Saints Row   December 31, 2023  Ghostrunner   January 1, 2024  Escape Academy   January 2, 2024  20 Minutes Till Dawn   






20 Minutes Till Dawn will be available for free via the Epic Games Store until January 3 at 11:00 AM ET, at which point it will return to its normal price as the next mystery giveaway - and the penultimate one in the holiday celebration - is revealed. While a release date has yet to be confirmed, 20 Minutes Till Dawn&#39;s spin-off, 20 Minutes Till Dawn: Emberpath has already been announced. Emberpath promises a condensed Action RPG experience alongside 20 Minutes Till Dawn&#39;s dynamic gameplay and build options, so now is a great time to jump into the original through Epic Games Store&#39;s giveaway.
