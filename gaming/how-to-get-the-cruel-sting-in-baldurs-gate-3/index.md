## Literature Review

The Cruel Sting can be one of the best Longsword weapons in Baldur’s Gate 3 depending on your build. Here’s where and how to unlock it.





The main difference presented by Cruel Sting in comparison to some other swords in the game is its unique weapon ability called Sting The Helpless. With it, if the equipping character is a drow elf, they will deal 1~4 Poison damage against Restrained targets. This is particularly good, as Cruel Sting itself unlocks the spell Ensnaring Strands, which can inflict such as status effect on opponents. As such, this is a great weapon for Minthara in Baldur’s Gate 3, for instance, or a drow custom character that is either a Fighter or a Paladin. Before putting it to good use, however, you need to find and unlock Cruel Sting.





 Cruel Sting’s Location In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

The Cruel Sting Longsword can only be unlocked in Act 2 of the game. You will have, essentially, two opportunities to grab it. The first one will happen when you follow the Harpers outside of the Last Light Inn. They will lead you and your party to an ambush, where you can pick up the Moonlantern in Baldur’s Gate 3, which will keep those in its radius from the Shadow Curse that afflicts the land. Upon setting up the trap in the ruins of a destroyed house, players can confront the drider Kar’niss and his followers for the Moonlantern.

                  How To Get (&amp; Fix) The Moonlantern In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   The Moonlantern can help your party move through the Shadow Curse in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but you have to try and fix this item first after you get it.   




At this point, you can fight Kar’niss and his entire entourage and, upon defeating them, you can loot Cruel Sting right off of Kar’niss’ body. If you prefer to play it safe, especially considering your party’s lack of protection against the Shadow Curse, you can resolve your issues with Kar’niss diplomatically. With this method, he will reluctantly grant you the Moonlantern and leave with his group toward the square in the middle of Reithwin Town in Baldur’s Gate 3.



For reference, Kar’niss and his allies can be found in the square between Gerringothe’s Tollhouse and Thisobald’s Waning Moon distillery.




Once you encounter Kar’niss again, he and his group will have been completely subdued and transformed by the Shadow Curse and will automatically initiate a battle against your group. There is no reasoning them out of this, so the only way is to defeat them. Upon victory, you can obtain the Cruel Sting by looting Kar’niss’ body in the Shadow-Cursed Lands in Baldur’s Gate 3.
