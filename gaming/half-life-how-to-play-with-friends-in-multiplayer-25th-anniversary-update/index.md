## Literature Review

The 25th Anniversary Update to Half-Life includes the ability to play with your friends in multiplayer, but this can be a little tricky to set up.





Anyone who wants to return to Black Mesa or dive into it for the first time should pick up the game while it is discounted on Steam. This supreme sale during the Anniversary Update will not last forever, but it is the best way to obtain this classic FPS as of this time of writing. With many mods for Half-Life still being produced to this day, many expansions to this game&#39;s content make it worth picking up.




                  Video Game Mods Better Than Official DLC   Sometimes the efforts of a dedicated video game modder team can surpass AAA studios&#39; official DLC, as these impressive mod projects prove.

The only way to play with your friends in the 25th Anniversary Update is to create a local server and configure your IP address so other players can join your game. This process can be complicated and requires you to have a decent router and firewall that prevents unsolicited incoming connections. According to Half-Life&#39;s Steam Support page, you will need to have administrative access to your network hardware to set this up.

First, port your router to 27015 on both TCP and UDP protocols to initialize the server creation for your Half-Life game. Then, open the game and click the menu option before heading to the &#34;Create Server&#34; prompt. Selecting this option comes with a few different presets that can help configure your server&#39;s settings to exactly what you want them to be before creating the multiplayer space.



If you are unsure what your public IP address is based on data provided by your router, feel free to visit a third-party website such as &#34;whatismyip&#34; to identify your specific connection to the Internet.




The last step is to type two commands into your console, the &#34;sv_lan0&#34; and &#34;ip[your IP address],&#34; based on the port made to your router earlier. Make sure to replace your IP address with the public IP recorded to protect your router&#39;s identity and give a universal code to incoming Half-Life players. You might have to enter the &#34;heartbeat&#34; command as well to update the IP address with the Steam Master servers.




Once this step is done, your friends should be able to use the public IP to join your game in multiplayer and enjoy all the new polish given to Half-Life for its 25th Anniversary Update.
