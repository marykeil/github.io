## Literature Review

Although players will have to find Wild Greens for a quest in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the name of this item actually refers to another material.





The &#34;Gloom-Borne Illness&#34; quest is given in Kakarikio Village by the character Lasil, whose grandmother has fallen ill with a deadly disease related to The Depths area. You might recognize this as the awful Gloom status effect in Tears of the Kingdom, an ailment that drains Link&#39;s health over time. Since this family member isn&#39;t a legendary hero, only a special Porridge recipe with a few Wild Greens can cure them.

 Where To Get Sundelions (Wild Greens) In Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 
          

There are no items called &#34;Wild Greens&#34; in Tears of the Kingdom, with the quest actually referring to Sundelion plants you must collect instead. Sundelions are found on Sky Islands and can be spotted as large plants with petals shaped like a star. A distinct black outline of their yellow and orange bloom is even easier to spot at night, as the plant also glows in the dark in grasslands or next to trees.

Almost every Sky Island has at least one Sundelion on it since these &#34;Wild Greens&#34; tend to grow close to the Sun, as their name might suggest. The easiest way to reach the skies above Hyrule is to use a Skyview Tower in Tears of the Kingdom that can launch Link into the air. From there, use your paraglider or an item like the Glide Shirt to float down onto one of the larger Islands that hosts a lot of plant life.






Activating different Shrines found on Sky Islands gives you access to many fast travel points for Link to easily travel to locations where Sundelions are abundant.




While &#34;Wild Greens&#34; may refer to Sundelions, there are several other plants that you could use for the Porridge recipe as well. Korok Frond, Hyrule Herb, or basically any wild plant that you harvest may count as an ingredient for the food needed to cure Lasil&#39;s grandmother. However, you will want to prioritize Sundelion since it is still an incredibly valuable item that helps cure Link from the Gloom condition in Tears of the Kingdom.



 How To Complete The Gloom-Borne Illness Quest In Zelda: TOTK 
          

Link must gather a few other ingredients for Lasil with the Sundelion, including Hylian Rice and Fresh Milk. Rice may be found practically anywhere on the map, but Milk is better to purchase from the General Store in Hateno Village. Combining these with the &#34;Wild Greens&#34; will create a Sunny Veggie Porridge, which will cure the Gloom afflicting the grandmother in Tears of the Kingdom.




Learning where to find Wild Greens in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom puts players on the right path to complete this quest, earning them good rewards.
