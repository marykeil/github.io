## Literature Review

The followers of Skyrim are as diverse as the game world itself, offering variety in NPC companionship, but some are the best of the absolute best.




Some Dragonborn prefer to experience the game alone, but for those who enjoy a bit of camaraderie, The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim&#39;s best followers can provide them with invaluable company and a helping hand in combat. Bringing one of these allies along while adventuring through Tamriel can help prevent getting too overwhelmed by swarms of enemies or even the occasional dragon. Of the 66 characters who can tag along as companions in the game, there are vastly different personalities and abilities, with some friends being much more useful in Skyrim than others are. 
Just like standard NPCs, every follower has individual strengths and weaknesses that set them apart. Some have a higher maximum level than others, whereas others might be more adept with a certain weapon or school of magic compared to their competition. All of Skyrim&#39;s essential followers, who can&#39;t be killed in battle thanks to their narrative significance, are inherently some of the strongest companions. However, not every one of Skyrim&#39;s best followers needs immortality to be considered the most powerful.

With so many fish in the sea, it can be difficult to pick a spouse - but the Dragonborn won&#39;t regret marrying one of Skyrim&#39;s best wives.












 








 15  Mjoll The Lioness Is The Voice Of Justice In Skyrim 
Nord Warrior In Riften
        

Mjoll The Lioness is best described as a fierce fighter with strong morals, and it shows in her actions and dialogue. She&#39;s opposed to evil outfits like the Dark Brotherhood, and she possesses a strong sense of compassion and justice. She can be found near the Bee and Barb Inn within Riften. Some of the other companions do have better stats in combat, but Mjoll has a special charm that feels pure and honest.





 14  Ingjard Doesn&#39;t Judge As A Skyrim Follower 
Nord Warrior Member Of The Dawnguard
        

In Skyrim&#39;s cold environment, Ingjard&#39;s innate ability to have 50% resistance to frost helps, particularly when battling enemies who use ice powers. Ingjard is a part of the Dawnguard DLC for the game, and she will not be able to become a companion until after the &#34;Prophet&#34; quest for that DLC has been completed. It is a nice feature that she does not seem to be bothered if the Dragonborn chooses to be a vampire, which many would find to be a bit off-putting. 


Ingjard doesn’t have a level cap, meaning she will grow as powerful as the player does while progressing through the game. Her only real downfall lies in that she prefers two-handed weapons, meaning that she can be easily taken down by enemies who attack quickly.





 13  Erandur Is Skyrim&#39;s Pettiest Priest 
Dark Elf Priest Of Mara
        

Although Dawnstar is certainly not the most popular of cities in Skyrim, the possible companion that is found there in the Windpeak Inn, Erandur, is one of the most interesting and complex characters in the game. He&#39;s a stoic character who has the general appearance of a Disney villain, but his combat abilities can make Erandur one of Skyrim&#39;s best followers nonetheless. He harbors some solid magic skills in battle, and when things get up close and personal, he&#39;ll even bust out a mace to defend himself.





 12  Vilkas Is A Wise Companion In Skyrim 
Nord Werewolf Of Whiterun


 







The brother of fellow lycanthropic Nord, Farkas, Vilkas is a master-level trainer in the art of two-handed weapons. He offers some in-depth dialogue options compared to his sibling and is considered the most intellectual member of the Companions, a group that possesses Skyrim&#39;s werewolf blood. He does well in battle against foes, but is not as physically powerful as Farkas. That said, he is still quite effective in combat, and his chatty nature can keep the player company as they&#39;re traveling through the wilderness.





 11  Jenassa Is A Passionate Killer In Skyrim 
Dark Elf Ranger In Whiterun
        

Not only is Jenassa one of the best companions in Skyrim, but she is also among the earliest that a player can get, as she is often found in Whiterun at the Drunken Huntsman. Despite having a fondness for mead, she has expert archery skills, which are useful in combat while adventuring. She is not the most approachable and friendly of NPCs, but she also does not seem to mind at all if the Dragonborn chooses to do illegal activities while she is tagging along.

In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, players will get a bounty if they commit crimes. The amount depends on what laws they break and how many.








 10  Aela The Huntress Is A Fierce Skyrim Follower 
Nord Werewolf In Jorrvaskr


 







Aela is a member of the Companions, a master of archery, and one of Skyrim&#39;s strongest followers. Being the most fanatical member of the Circle, she&#39;s the only one who refuses to be cured of her lycanthropy. She constantly talks about being a werewolf - and all the bloodshed and hunting that it entails - with obvious passion. Aela is extremely capable and worthy of taking along on a trip or two. 





 9  Eola Is A Creepy Skyrim Cannibal 
Breton Cannibal
        

Having a cannibal as a traveling companion is not that comforting of a proposition, particularly in the dangerous world of Skyrim. Eola doesn&#39;t help to calm any fears either, as she is not a person of high morals or kindness, although she does try to convince the Dragonborn to join her cult and learn to enjoy cannibalism themselves. If one can overlook these objectionable features, she is a good ally to have and is particularly proficient at sneaking. Her necromantic ability to resurrect corpses can be extremely unsettling when one considers that she also eats people, but it does prove useful in combat.





 8  Teldryn Sero Is A Jack Of All Trades In Skyrim 
Dark Elf Mercenary


 







Few characters are as versatile and tough as Teldryn Sero, and he continues to impress as a Skyrim mercenary who is actually worth hiring. Players will need to own the Dragonborn DLC to unlock this spellsword, at which point they can take advantage of his excellent combat prowess and tactical efficiency. Sero wields Elven weapons and Chitin armor, which is an odd combination, but it clearly works. He can also wield magic alongside one-handed weapons, which is a bonus. Aside from his battle skills, he&#39;s a chatterbox who can keep conversations going for a while.

Each sellsword in Skyrim seems to boast about being the best - but there&#39;s one that isn&#39;t exaggerating, and that players should favor over the rest.








 7  Illia Makes Use Of Magic As A Skyrim Follower 
Imperial Ice Mage
        

Mage followers are scarce in Skyrim, which makes Illia not only an even better companion but more unique than the other options the Dragonborn is presented with. Illia is highly proficient in frost-based spells, particularly Ice Spike - which can deal incredible amounts of damage. As magic users are prone to be, she is weaker and more vulnerable to taking heavy damage in close range, but her strengths at a distance can make up for it. 





 6  J&#39;zargo Is The Best Khajiit Follower In Skyrim 
Khajiit Sorcerer


 







J’zargo is a Khajiit apprentice apprentice at the College of Winterhold in Skyrim who is talented in his magical abilities despite still being a student. J&#39;zargo prefers to focus on lightning and fire magic, although he can wield many different elemental attacks in combat as needed. His personality is not the best, but it is still fun to be able to have a Khajiit as a follower. Generally, the Khajiit are looked down upon due to the race being known for sneaking and stealing, but J&#39;zargo appears focused on honing his magic more than theft.

 5  Cicero Is A Calculated Clown In Skyrim 
Imperial Assassin And Jester
        

Incredibly divisive among players but unquestionably talented, Cicero is the overly passionate keeper of the Dark Brotherhood&#39;s Night Mother in Skyrim. If players can tolerate his bizarre behavior and oddball ramblings, they’ll find an effective and terrifying assassin who will slit the throats of enemies with ease but also randomly break out in dance at the most inappropriate moments. Cicero also has some surprisingly complex dialogue, meaning he can keep the game’s long, winding trails interesting. His combat abilities and penchant for delivering zany one-liners and stories make him a memorable alternative to the traditional warrior type.





 4  Argis The Bulwark Is A Self-Assured Skyrim Follower 
Nord Warrior Housecarl In Markarth
        

For good old-fashioned strength and stopping power, Argis The Bulwark is hard to beat. In a fight, it&#39;s hard to beat his efficiency with weapons, as well as his experience with heavy armor. In addition to being a loyal fighter, Argis also sports some entertaining (and at times, overly cocky) dialogue, which alludes to his Nordic origins. With his battle prowess and confident nature at their side, players can rest assured knowing they have one of Skyrim&#39;s best followers as a reliable backup.





 3  Lydia Is An Underrated Follower In Skyrim 
Nord Warrior Housecarl In Whiterun
        

Probably the most recognizable housecarl from Skyrim, Lydia holds her ground surprisingly well alongside the Dragonborn. She&#39;s incredibly well-rounded as a character and one of the game&#39;s best marriage options too, making her a solid fit for any adventure. Lydia is generally the first Skyrim companion that players encounter, which means that they can spend almost the entire game with her if they choose to.

Skyrim followers have an unfortunate habit of getting lost or dying, and the housecarl Lydia is no exception. Here are a few tricks to get her back.








 2  Frea Brings Skaal Techniques To Skyrim 
Skaal Shaman In Solstheim
        

Frea can be found at the Skaal Village, which is part of the Dragonborn DLC pack. The daughter of the village shaman, Frea is an astute warrior with some serious mental fortitude, making her one of the most loyal followers in Skyrim. Plus, she&#39;s one of the few characters who can dual-wield weapons, which can offer an interesting change of pace. This follower is capable of leveling up continuously, which is handy for those who want to pick one follower for the duration of the game.
Players may have a hard time persuading Frea to accompany them if their speech isn&#39;t high enough, so they might want to practice their speaking skills before attempting to recruit Frea as a follower in Skyrim. 






 1  Serana Is The Best Follower In Skyrim 
Pure-Blood Vampire


 







Skyrim&#39;s best follower is Serana, one of the few pure-blood vampires to exist in the Elder Scrolls universe. Serana plays a large part in the main quest for the Dawnguard DLC and is designed as one of the most advanced followers in the game. Unlike other companions, Serana will interact with the environment in complex ways, often commenting on the state of the Dragonborn’s situation, unlike others who only sport generic, repetitive dialogue.
As a vampire, it makes sense that she is also a strong necromancer who can raise the corpses of enemies to fight alongside her, but she also has melee weapons at her disposal. Between her thoughtful conversations, unique vampire quirks, and ability to resurrect the dead, it&#39;s plain to see that Serana is the best follower in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.
