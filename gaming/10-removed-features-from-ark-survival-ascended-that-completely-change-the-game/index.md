## Literature Review

Although itâ€™s a remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, Survival Ascended has changed up some features that might make it feel like a different game.




Like many games, ARK: Survival Ascended went through changes in development that resulted in features being cut from the final product. As a result, the game&#39;s early variations throughout development that might&#39;ve been teased don&#39;t match the game that ends up being launched. While some removed features are so minor that their absence isn&#39;t felt, other removed features could&#39;ve made Ark: Survival Ascended feel like a completely different game.
Ark: Survival Ascended remakes Ark: Survival Evolved, but it&#39;s more than an upgrade to graphics and performance. Survival Ascended falls into the category of being a reimagining of the original game with quality of life improvements and changes to content and in-game mechanics such as crafting. Some content, however, didn&#39;t make it into the final cut. It&#39;s still important to note that among this content are features that - instead of being fully removed - could still be added at a later date through DLC or patches.









 








 10  Cryopods 
Easy Transportation Of Dinos
        

Cryopods allow dinos to be stored in essentially a stasis that turns them into an item. The primary benefit of this is that the dinos can be transported like items in Survival Evolved, making moving them long distances much faster than it would be otherwise. However, since this was removed in Ark: Survival Ascended, moving dinos is a longer process as they can&#39;t be carried, making it difficult to carry out an attack due to the set-up required.





 9  Map Engrams 
Items Are Map Specific


 







When searching through Engrams for the current map, trying to look at those of other maps is no longer possible. This means that Engrams are now specific to their map and unavailable when playing on other maps. The result is that maps will require different strategies that are unique to each one instead of being able to use the same strategy across every map, since it was previously possible to get the strongest Engrams no matter which map was used.





 8  Mods Removed 
Aside From Those Included With The Game
        

Going into Ark: Survival Ascended means no longer having the abundance of mods that were previously available for Ark. Of course, it&#39;s only a matter of time until the modding community replenishes the number of mods available for Survival Ascended. However, in the meantime, it makes the game feel different after getting used to using the mods and then switch to having only the default mods.





 7  Server Transfers 
No Transfers Between Official Or Unofficial Servers
        

Once somebody is on a server, they can&#39;t transfer to a different server. However, there are issues that arise from this that can be incredibly frustrating. If one group takes over a server and controls it to the point that others are unable to enjoy their time playing the game, then they aren&#39;t able to switch to a new server. The inability to transfer can lead to a lot of lost time and effort, since it means starting over in order to be on a different server.





 6  Tekgrams 
Almost All Tekgrams Removed


 







While Engrams are now map-specific, a lot of Tekgrams have been removed entirely, aside from small teleporters. This includes the Cryopods that are mentioned above, but more structures and items like generators as well. As a result, there&#39;s less access to items that make the game a bit easier and the convenience that comes from Tekgrams.

 5  Movement Speed 
Formerly Used To Outrun Enemies
        

The strategy in Survival Evolved was stacking as much movement speed as possible in order to outrun any enemies. This made kiting enemies a solid way to handle them regardless of the enemy type, and in the end, this build was simply too powerful. However, the movement speed isn&#39;t completely set as there&#39;s an option for speed in the advanced setting when creating a new world, which makes it at least less prevalent.





 4  Net Projectile 
Taming Relies On Bolas


 







The net was used for taming medium-sized dinos, keeping them still and making the process easier. Now, the best way to keep dinos still in order to tame them is the bola. Humans can also wiggle out of bolas, and the time they last is limited to 30 seconds. However, the Net Projectile lasted for up to a minute and immobilized targets, meaning they had to be cut out of the net to escape before its time ran out.





 3  Jump Spamming 
Jumping Used To Boost Movement Speed
        

This is connected to the movement speed removal because there was a glitch where jumping repeatedly increased movement speed, which could result in characters being launched long distances. However, with the removal of movement speed, spamming jumps isn&#39;t as helpful as it used to be in Survival Evolved. Instead, jumping slows down the character&#39;s speed in Survival Ascended, so outrunning dinos is now a more complicated affair without a fundamental mechanic like jumping boosting the player&#39;s speed.

 2  Low Health Speed 
Threshold Changes For It To Toggle
        

This is another feature that was changed because of the removal of increased movement speed in A:SA. While low health speed hasn&#39;t been removed completely, ways to get around the reduced movement speed have been removed. As a result, the game is again more difficult without stacking movement speed, and it doesn&#39;t help that the threshold to toggle the low health speed is higher. This means that survival at low health turns into a true challenge.





 1  Aim Offset 
Projectiles Are Fired Where The Crosshairs Show
        

A:SE&#39;s aiming offset was removed, so when firing a projectile, it actually goes where the crosshairs show it will. Unlike some of the features that were removed, this one is fairly beneficial. It&#39;s much easier to aim in third-person when the crosshairs show exactly where the projectile will go, instead of having to figure out how the offset affects the aim and account for that. As a result, combat feels better with this change in A:SA, and it&#39;s slightly less frustrating to aim projectiles.
In essence, Ark: Survival Ascended might be a remake of Survival Evolved, but a lot of changes that were made end up giving it a fresh feeling. Some features might be added in the future through patches or DLC, but right now, the game is in a state where survival actually feels more difficult because of the removed or altered features. While the additional challenges and lack of mods might leave it in a state that doesn&#39;t suit every taste, the result is being able to start fresh and grow with the content that&#39;ll come in the future of ARK: Survival Ascended.
