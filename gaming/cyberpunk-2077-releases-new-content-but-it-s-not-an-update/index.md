## Literature Review

There&#39;s a new way to experience more of the Cyberpunk 2077 world of Night City, but it&#39;s not in the form of content added to the game itself.




Cyberpunk 2077 has had a big year thanks to the Phantom Liberty expansion, but new content connected to the title isn&#39;t sticking purely to the video game realm. After a 2020 launch that fell somewhat short of the lofty expectations that years of anticipation had built up, Cyberpunk 2077 has turned things around with a number of key updates that improved and even overhauled aspects of the game. The property has also found success in other regards, perhaps most notably in the Netflix animated series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners that explored the world of Night City from a fresh new angle.




Cyberpunk 2077 has its roots in the Cyberpunk series of tabletop RPGs that dates back to the 1980s, and the game reflects the rich lore of a setting that&#39;s been in development for decades. Using this robust source material offers plenty of advantages, but it can also make things a little overwhelming for newcomers. It&#39;s easy to lose track of the details of Night City history and culture when focusing on the more immediate story at hand, which is unfortunate considering how much value there is in understanding all the factors that make the city what it is in Cyberpunk 2077.

                  Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Announced, Releases Early December   Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will contain the game&#39;s Phantom Liberty DLC and will be released in time for the holidays both digitally and on disc.   


 Night City Archives Is A Cyberpunk 2077 Video Series 
          




A new way to brush up on the history of Night City is now available from the official Cyberpunk 2077 YouTube account, structured as a series of short-form videos that provide an overview of the subject. Called Night City Archives, these videos are framed as files accessed by Netrunners and presented in the style of interfaces that appear in-game. CD Projekt Red hasn&#39;t made any official announcement about how many episodes are planned, but two are currently available, titled &#34;A Brief History of Night City&#34; and &#34;A Nation Divided.&#34;

                  Cyberpunk 2077: Where Night City Is Located In Real Life   Night City is the fictional megalopolis setting of Cyberpunk 2077, but its real-life location is on the West Coast of the United States.   



 Learning About Night City Is Easier Than Ever Before 
          




Although the details of Cyberpunk 2077 lore are already familiar to some enthusiasts, Night City Archives is the perfect way for those with less familiarity to acquaint themselves with key details. Anyone who&#39;s watched Cyberpunk: Edgerunners but never played the game can pick up some missing context here, and it serves as a perfect refresher for players thinking about picking up Phantom Liberty after a long hiatus from the game. The presentation comes off as generally clear and efficient, making it easier to absorb than a text source like a wiki.

                  &#34;Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists&#34; - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review   Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty&#39;s unpredictable spy-thriller story is full of jaw-dropping moments, and it&#39;s got the gameplay to match.   

Considering how much material there is to potentially cover, it would be nice for Night City Archives to go on for a number of episodes. Early entries could focus on key information about the setting, while later additions could delve into more esoteric areas of interest. Regardless of how many are ultimately created, Night City Archives is an exciting new way to get a look into the world of Cyberpunk 2077, even if it doesn&#39;t come with any gameplay attached.
