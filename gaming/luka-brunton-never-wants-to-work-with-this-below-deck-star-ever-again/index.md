# Luka Brunton Never Wants To Work With This Below Deck Star Ever Again


## SUMMARY 



  Luka Brunton, bosun on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, revealed on Watch What Happens Live that he would never want to work with deckhand Culver Bradbury again.   Culver&#39;s lack of initiative and laziness on deck, along with friction over his girlfriend, made him an unpopular choice among the crew.   Luka also shared his opinions on his romantic connections with Natalya Scudder, Jessika Asai, and Katie Flood, praising Natalya&#39;s work ethic and choosing Katie as the one he would want to backpack around Europe with.

## Literature Review

Below Deck Med and Below Deck Down Under alum Luka Brunton served realness in his recent interview responses about who he wouldn&#39;t work with again.




Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 bosun Luka Brunton threw shade at one of his Below Deck Down Under cast mates about not wanting to work with them again. Luka debuted on Below Deck Down Under season 2, which finished airing right before Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 dropped, so Luka was on back-to-back seasons. In Australia, Luka was the lead deckhand under returning franchise bosun João Franco. In the Med, Luka was under bosun Ruan Irving before Ruan&#39;s falsified documents came to light and he was let go. Captain Sandy Yawn asked Luka to become bosun, and he did a good job throughout the season.




Luka was recently on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, along with Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 chef Jack Luby. On the deep-diving show, Luka was asked which Below Deck Down Under crew member he would never want to work with again. He paused shortly before saying deckhand Culver Bradbury&#39;s name.


 

Culver was known for having a lack of initiative on deck and trying to always do the bare minimum while being self-serving. When Luka was leading the exterior team, he picked up on Culver&#39;s laziness along with the other deck team members. Moreover, Luka stole Culver&#39;s girlfriend, Jaimee Neale, at the end of the season.

 Luka Brunton Doesn’t Have Any Chemistry With Jessika Asai 

 

Luka&#39;s response about Culver is not surprising since Culver is one of the least-liked Below Deck franchise deck team members. Not only was there friction over Jaimee&#39;s affection, but there was also clashing on deck. Luka seemed to get along well with everyone on Below Deck Down Under, so Culver is also the obvious choice because of that.

Along with being a straight-shooter on deck and in his Culver answer, on another segment of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Luka kept it real in a &#34;Stew Would You Rather?&#34; game Andy Cohen played with him on the show. He had to answer who he would pick between Natalya Scudder, Jessika Asai, and Katie Flood since he has had romantic connections to all three Below Deck Mediterranean women. He pegged Natalya as having the best work ethic, being the best kisser, being Captain Sandy&#39;s favorite, and having the silliest sense of humor.




Luka chose Katie as the one he would most want to backpack around Europe with and whose smile drives him the craziest. Katie was also the last woman of the three Luka had texted. When asked which of them he would bring home to his parents, he threw out that Jess would not be it because &#34;there wasn&#39;t any chemistry there.&#34; But he also said he wouldn&#39;t bring any of the three home at all. Luka was serving the Below Deck shade during his interview with Andy. Fans learned of his continued disdain for Culver and feelings about Jess.



Below Deck season 11 premieres on February 5, 2024, at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
