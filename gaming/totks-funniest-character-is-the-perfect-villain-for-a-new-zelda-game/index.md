# TOTKs Funniest Character Is The Perfect Villain For A New Zelda Game


## SUMMARY 



  The funniest character from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could potentially become the perfect villain in the next Zelda title.   The Yiga Clan&#39;s Master Kohga, known for his comedic antics, could pose a major threat to Hyrule and potentially resurrect Ganon.   The return of Ganon or Ganondorf is inevitable in the Zelda series, and a game centered around preventing his resurrection with the help of Kohga and the Yiga Clan would be an excellent plot to pursue.

## Literature Review

One of the funniest characters in The Legend of Zelda, and certainly the most hilarious in TOTK, is actually perfect as the villain of the next game.




Although no more content is planned for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, its funniest character could still make a return as the perfect villain in the next Legend of Zelda title. The series’ latest game introduced a wide variety of characters alongside returning figures, although the lack of DLC does mean that some of TOTK’s characters have been left with unfinished stories. But on the other hand, when considering what a sequel to TOTK could entail, one of these same characters is now ideally suited for the role of an antagonist.




There have been many recurring characters in the Zelda series over the years, with some of the most prominent of course being the many versions of Link, Zelda, and Ganon. However, plenty of minor characters have also had various incarnations appear time and time again, such as the bug-loving merchant Beedle. Tears of the Kingdom itself, being a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, is particularly notable for the size of its returning cast, even as this same cast has expanded even further with plenty of new characters. Among these characters are plenty of new fan-favorites, whose popularity could easily see them returning in future titles.

                  The Next Zelda Should Learn From BOTW &amp; TOTK, But Skip One Key Feature   Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom brought a lot of new features to the Zelda series, but the next game should skip one key feature.    


 Master Kohga &amp; The Yiga Clan Can Pose The Next Major Threat To Hyrule 
          




Of course, one character who already seems all but guaranteed to return is the Yiga Clan’s Master Kohga, who was last seen being blasted out of the Depths by his own rocket whilst swearing revenge on Link. Such a memorable exit makes it seem extremely unlikely that it will not be left unaddressed as the entire scene is clearly foreshadowing some future confrontation with the comical villain. This may not necessarily be a problem for the current incarnation of Link; given the long lifespans of both Hylians and Sheikah in particular, it seems plausible that Kohga could return to menace a new hero in a generation or two.

Despite ostensibly being a grave threat to Hyrule, and Link in particular, it can be hard to take the Yiga Clan seriously. The red-clad ninjas display a borderline-obsessive love of bananas and concoct some truly absurd assassination schemes, including posing as a fortune-telling Cucco in TOTK. Master Kohga himself is at the peak of the Yiga in both power and comedy, being an egotistical and theatrical man even when well over a century old (as his appearance in Age of Calamity proves is the case for BOTW and TOTK). His persistence would have made him a perfect villain for DLC for TOTK, and now by extension for its potential sequel.





 

A further appearance from Kohga could also lead to the reappearance of Sooga, or another Yiga following in the stoic bodyguard’s footsteps. Despite being firmly established in Age of Calamity, Sooga did not appear in any content for either BOTW or TOTK, leaving his status in the main timeline at this point somewhat uncertain. While it is entirely possible that the Yiga died at some point in the century prior to Breath of the Wild, the lack of definitive evidence also means that Sooga could make his return in a future title to enhance the threat posed by the Yiga clan.



 Master Kohga Could Bring Fresh Devastation To Hyrule In A Zelda Spin-Off 
          




Although Kohga is undoubtedly entertaining enough to be the antagonist of a DLC adventure, it is less likely that he would believably pose a threat on his own sufficient for an entire game. However, this does not need to be the case; as the leader of what is effectively a cult dedicated to Ganon, Kohga could instead trigger Hyrule’s next major crisis by attempting to resurrect the Demon King. This would allow Kohga and the Yiga to pose a significant threat by association in the game’s beginning, ultimately leading to their ultimate success and the return of Hyrule’s greatest foe once more for the game’s climactic battle.

It is worth noting that the Yiga do display occasional moments of brilliance. For example, they successfully steal the Thunder Helm from the Gerudo in BOTW, and then manage to recreate it in TOTK’s Lightning Helm. They also manage to essentially colonize the Depths and even unlock the potential of Zonai Devices in the latter game, using them to build a variety of menacing vehicles. Even Kohga, for all his typical clumsiness, is able to see through Link in an instant if the hero approaches him whilst dressed as a Yiga Footsoldier. As such, their ability to arrange Ganon’s resurrection is perhaps not as unlikely as it may initially seem.




Of course, this would be far from the first time Ganon has been revived by other characters. For example, his adoptive mothers Koume and Kotake resurrect him for the final battle of the linked game version of the Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons duology. Interestingly, the Gerudo witches are actually briefly glimpsed in TOTK during a Dragon Tear memory, although nothing seems to have come of this. This could also be intended as foreshadowing, perhaps to reintroduce Twinrova as the true mastermind behind Ganon’s next revival, although this is only speculation at present.



Ganon was also resurrected by Yuga in A Link Between Worlds, after which the two fused together to form Yuga Ganon.




                  One Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Memory Wastes A Boss Fight Tease   One of the Memories in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could foreshadow an incredible boss fight, but this fails to come to fruition.    






 Ganon’s Return Is Ultimately Inevitable In The Zelda Series 
Master Kohga Could Resurrect Ganon In The Next Zelda Game
         

The return of Ganon, or perhaps Ganondorf, would undoubtedly be a highlight for any future Zelda game. Furthermore, between the Curse of Demise and the character’s own enduring popularity, the King of Evil will undoubtedly not be gone for long. As such, having a game centered around the struggle to prevent his resurrection would be an excellent plot to pursue, and Kohga and the rest of the Yiga Clan are perfectly positioned to facilitate this. Although with that being said, it also seems inevitable that they will do so in their familiar, somewhat bumbling manner.

Having Ganon be resurrected by Kohga, whether through the guidance of Twinrova or his own merit, is both a believable and intriguing direction for the Legend of Zelda series to take for its next title. Kohga’s hilariously over-confident and petulant personality seemingly make him an unlikely mastermind for such a scheme, but at the same time the juxtaposition could only heighten the impact of his success (especially if Ganon then turns out to be distinctly unimpressed by his loyal servant). Kohga brings a distinct levity to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but at the same time he may also soon finally become a dire threat to Hyrule.
