# Every Pokémon Protagonists Official Name


## SUMMARY 



  The tradition of customizing trainer names in Pokémon games goes all the way back to Pokémon Red and Blue, but the main characters also have official names.   The official names of Pokémon game protagonists have been confirmed in various ways, such as appearing as recruitable trainers in Pokémon Masters EX.   While many players like to customize their Pokémon protagonist characters, there are official names available for those who prefer not to come up with their own.

## Literature Review

The protagonists that have appeared throughout the mainline Pokémon games have official names that have been used in spin-off media in the past.




The Pokémon series has long allowed for customizable trainer names, but each Pokémon protagonist has an official, canonical name as well. The option to name the main characters of any Pokémon game is a tradition that dates back to the original games, Pokémon Red and Blue, where the default names were Satoshi and Shigeru, referencing Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and Nintendo icon Shigeru Miyamoto. As time went on, and characters from the mainline games were given roles in different titles, they received canon names that have stuck with them since.




The official names of the Pokémon game protagonists have been confirmed in a number of different ways. Many received canon names by appearing in Pokémon Masters EX as trainers the player is able to recruit in-game. There are some games where the protagonist that isn&#39;t selected becomes a prominent character in the story, as is the case with the protagonist options for Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and the official Pokémon protagonist names are often the default choice when starting a game. Many like to customize Pokémon protagonist characters, and more recent games have catered to this with more appearance and clothing customization options, but there are official names available for those who can&#39;t think of an alternative.

                  &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review   The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.   





 The Official Name Of Every Pokémon Protagonist 
          

All the official names of the Pokémon protagonists are in the table below, separated by release. Prior to Pokémon Crystal, there was no option to play as a female trainer, so Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, and Silver only have male protagonist names listed.

 Pokémon Game(s)  Male Protagonist Name  Female Protagonist Name   Red and Blue  Red  N/A   Yellow   FireRed and LeafGreen  Leaf   Gold and Silver  Ethan  N/A   Crystal  Kris   HeartGold and SoulSilver  Lyra   Ruby and Sapphire  Brendan  May   Emerald   Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire   Diamond and Pearl  Lucas  Dawn   Platinum   Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Black and White  Hilbert  Hilda   Black 2 and White 2  Nate  Rosa   X and Y  Calem  Serena   Sun and Moon  Elio  Selene   Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon   Let&#39;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#39;s Go, Eevee!  Chase  Elaine   Sword and Shield  Victor  Gloria   Legends: Arceus  Rei  Akari   Scarlet and Violet  Florian  Juliana   








 Why Pokémon Trainers Have Canon Names 
          

It may seem as if the Pokémon protagonist names are random, but a few of them do have deeper meanings. Victor and Gloria from Pokémon Sword and Shield are references to the lyrics of the UK national anthem, which mentions both victory and glory. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s trainers, Florian is a name derived from Latin terms meaning &#34;flowering&#34; or &#34;blooming,&#34; and Juliana means &#34;youthful,&#34; both of which represent the fact that the characters are young children who are studying at school. Pokémon protagonists are always kids for a reason, and Florian and Juliana are just starting out on their big Pokémon adventure.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Review: Open-Ended Possibility   Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is engrossing at its best but clunky at its worst, offering an uneven but ultimately exceptional experience on Switch.   




It&#39;s likely that the inevitable remakes of classic games like Pokémon Black and White will retain the name of their Pokémon trainer protagonists, barring some massive change in the storyline that shakes things up. Recent games removed the ability to name a trainer&#39;s rivals, which is a shame, especially since the games still lack proper voice acting, which would necessitate the removal of certain name customization for the purpose of recording lines. Hopefully, the Pokémon tradition of offering official protagonist names while allowing trainers to choose their own alternatives will long endure.
