  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Arceus, the god of Pokémon, possesses the power to exploit Mewtwo&rsquo;s weaknesses and deal low or zero damage to him.
Mew, the original Pokémon from which Mewtwo was cloned, can defeat Mewtwo with its DNA that allows transformation into any living creature.
Others like Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, and several other Legendaries have the potential to defeat Mewtwo in battle, but there are still many that are weaker than this powerful Gen 1 Pokémon.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Is Mewtwo the most powerful Pokémon? There have been some strong Pokémon over the years, but how many of the most powerful Pokémon can rival them?</p>
<p>The philosophy behind Mewtwo’s creation was to make the world’s strongest Pokémon. Since Mewtwo is a clone of Mew, there seemed to be only one Pokémon that could match him at the time of his original creation. However, Pokémon has vastly expanded its universe since Gen 1 to include more powerful Legendaries, Mythicals, and even Ultra Beasts. Some of these are even deities that can stand toe-to-toe with the lab-created powerhouse. Despite the power of Mewtwo, however, there are other Pokémon who are more powerful.
In the years since Mewtwo&rsquo;s first appearance, the Pokémon franchise has continued to come out with more games and memorable monsters. For example, the most recent Gen 9 games have introduced Paradox Pokémon and even Stellar-types that are incredibly powerful. These newcomers come equipped with new techniques and battle strategies that make them unique challengers for Mewtwo&rsquo;s reputation as one of the most powerful Pokémon in existence.</p>
<p>Every Pokémon Battle Gimmick Through Gen 9, Ranked
Pokémon has had at least one major battle gimmick in each new generation, but which one is the best regarding its impact on the franchise?</p>
<p>Arceus Is Stronger Than Mewtwo
Arceus&rsquo; Type Changes Make Him A Formidable Foe</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Arceus is one of the strongest Pokémon in existence. Being the god of all Pokémon (who also created the universe), Arceus has an incredibly impressive power level. Arceus excels in combat by taking advantage of type weaknesses, resistances, and immunities. With the capability to switch his type on the go, Arceus would be able to land the Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks that Mewtwo is weak against. Mewtwo might be able to get in one or two hits, but Arceus&rsquo; type changes would also mean that Mewtwo&rsquo;s attacks would hit at low or zero damage.</p>
<p>Mew Can Be Even More Powerful Than Mewtwo
Mew Has The DNA Of All Pokémon In Its Body</p>
<p>Mewtwo is a clone of Mew. While Mewtwo’s savagery and raw strength might give Mew a run for its money, this little Legendary from Gen 1 still manages to come out on top. During their battle in the first movie, for instance, Mew seemed to have fun the entire time they were fighting. This suggests that if Mew were going full force it wouldn’t be much of a competition. Furthermore, Mew has the DNA of all Pokémon inside its body, allowing it to transform into any other living creature - even if the games have yet to show off Mew&rsquo;s prowess in the way the movies have.</p>
<p>Rayquaza Is Stronger Than Mewtwo
Mega Evolution Makes Rayquaza Even More Powerful</p>
<p>The strongest Legendary in Hoen is perhaps one of the strongest Pokémon in all continuity. Rayquaza was already a serious threat to the Pokémon world, capable of fighting off Deoxys by itself and calming a war between Groudon and Kyogre. However, Gen 6&rsquo;s introduction of Mega Evolution has caused the Rayquaza from Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire to become a force of nature capable of blasting through meteors with ease. There’s no limit to the power of Rayquaza now, and Mewtwo would easily lose a fight with it.</p>
<p>Lore Suggests Ho-Oh Can Be More Powerful Than Mewtwo
Sacred Fire Gives Ho-Oh An Edge</p>
<p>Ho-Oh is one of the most heavily worshiped Pokémon in the Johto Region, and its world-shattering potential makes it easy to see why. Not only does this gracious bird leave a beautiful trail wherever it flies, bringing luck to those who simply gaze upon it, but it can even revive those who were deceased. That’s all without mentioning its powers, as its Sacred Fire attack ensures that no one would be able to fight against it. Its power over mortality means that Mewtwo would have a hard time defeating it within Pokémon&rsquo;s own lore, too.</p>
<p>Palkia Is More Powerful Than Mewtwo In Lore
This Gen 4 Pokémon Can Command Space Itself</p>
<p>Palkia is a deity with command over space. He can warp reality and send people to other dimensions. His battle with Dialga was so intense that the two of them had to be sent to their own dimension, so they wouldn’t harm the rest of the world in the process. Palkia’s powers as a dragon and its immense abilities mean that most wouldn’t be able to stand a chance against it. Darkrai tried to stop both Pokémon in one of the movies, but he was soon defeated by both, so it makes sense that Mewtwo would find a similar fate.</p>
<p>Like Palkia, Dialga Could Probably Defeat Mewtwo
Dialga Is Able To Control Time</p>
<p>Palkia and Dialga would probably both be able to beat Mewtwo on their own. Palkia with its control over space, and Dialga with its control over time. That feat alone would allow Dialga to mess with Mewtwo and manipulate its surroundings. Furthermore, if Mewtwo managed to get a single hit on Dialga, all it would have to do is reverse time to get the better of Mewtwo’s strategy. That’s all without mentioning just how hard Dialga hits each time it lands an attack.</p>
<p>Ogerpon Could Likely Defeat Mewtwo One-On-One
The Ability To Change Its Type Gives Ogerpon An Edge</p>
<p>Introduced in Scarlet and Violet&rsquo;s Teal Mask DLC, Ogerpon is a powerful new Pokémon that can change its type with the help of masks. It&rsquo;s ability to Terastalize also makes it extra powerful, and it would likely give it an edge of Mewtwo in combat. In terms of lore, Ogerpon is strong on its own, but its versatility is really what makes it stand out.</p>
<p>Calyrex Could Beat Mewtwo
Spectrier and Glastrier Help Give Calyrex An Advantage</p>
<p>Calyrex was once the king of the Galar region, and it&rsquo;s one of the few Pokémon capable of taking on Mewtwo in a fight. Calyrex&rsquo; base form may be better designed for peace than combat, but this ruler has a few tools that make it a formidable opponent. First, Calyrex has the ability to see the past, present, and future. This means that Calyrex would see any of Mewtwo&rsquo;s plans coming before he could strike.</p>
<p>10 Pokémon That Deserve Their Own Spin-Off Game After Legends: Arceus
There are several Pokémon that could be put under the spotlight for a Legends: Arceus-like game, even if it is a spin-off. Here are some of the best.</p>
<p>Additionally, this Pokémon can bond with the Ice-type Glastrier or the Ghost-type Spectrier. While with the former, the pair is capable of dropping the surrounding temperature below -500 degrees Fahrenheit. Spectrier allows Calyrex to bombard its area with life-force stealing spirit flames. Either of these would likely be too much for Mewtwo.</p>
<p>Kyogre Is Stronger Than Mewtwo
Primal Form Kyogre Gets Even More Powerful</p>
<p>Kyogre and Groudon each have power over sea and land, respectively. In their standard forms, it’s likely that Mewtwo would’ve been able to defeat them, considering speed isn’t one of their strengths. However, with the addition of their Primal Forms, both become more powerful. Kyogre has become much stronger now, with the ability to make it permanently rainy to boost its attacks. Kyogre&rsquo;s power just gets a massive increase thanks to its Primal Form, and Mewtwo likely wouldn’t be able to handle it.</p>
<p>Groudon&rsquo;s Power Over Land Can Help It Defeat Mewtwo
Like Kyogre, Primal Form Makes Groudon Even Stronger</p>
<p>Groudon has power over land, which it could also use to overpower Mewtwo. Just like Kyogre, its Primal Form makes it even stronger and means Mewtwo could have a tough chance of defeating it. In the games, Groudon&rsquo;s ability to make it extremely dry and boost its attacks may make the fight with a Mewtwo a toss-up, but its power in Pokémon lore certainly makes it seem more powerful than Mewtwo.</p>
<p>Kyurem Black &amp; White Form Could Beat Mewtwo
Kyruem&rsquo;s Standard Form Might Lose, Though</p>
<p>Kyurem would probably lose a fight against Mewtwo in its standard form. However, once it is able to merge with either Reshiram or Zekrom, Kyurem gains a much better fighting chance. Its abilities combined with another massive Dragon Legendary mean that its sheer power would probably be enough to overthrow Mewtwo. Furthermore, Kyurem was never formally defeated by Keldeo in the movie, but rather just calmed down enough. This means that Kyurem has added durability that Mewtwo likely couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>Mewtwo Probably Couldn&rsquo;t Defeat Giratina
Lore and Combat Advantages Are On Giratina&rsquo;s Side</p>
<p>Giratina has the benefit of adaptability and type advantage over Mewtwo. Not only does it sport a dominant Ghost-typing, but it can also travel through the Distortion World at will and bring its opponents there for home-field advantage. All it would have to do is send Mewtwo to the Distortion World, and it likely wouldn’t stand a chance. Furthermore, Giratina’s elusive abilities and strong Ghost-type attacks would probably give it the edge it needed to defeat Mewtwo in in-game combat.</p>
<p>Eternatus Should Win Against Mewtwo
Eternamax Form Is Just Too Powerful</p>
<p>At first glance, Eternatus seems to be at a disadvantage against Mewtwo because of its typing. Dragon/Poison means that any Psychic attacks are going to land particularly hard against this cosmic threat, but Eternatus has an ace up its sleeve that Mewtwo doesn&rsquo;t. Mewtwo is likely to start the fight out strong against Eternatus. However, once it enters its Eternamax form, Eternatus could defeat Mewtwo, as the latter is unlikely to have any effective attacks or defenses for Eternatus&rsquo; massive 328-foot body. Zacian and Zamazenta were only able to stop this form with their special abilities, but Mewtwo lacks an equally specialized tool (for now).</p>
<p>Galarian Moltres Could Defeat Mewtwo
But A Regular Moltres Couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>A standard Moltres would be quick work for Mewtwo, but the incredibly powerful Galarian version would be able to hold its own. Its advantage starts with its typing. As a Dark- and Flying-type Pokémon, Galarian Moltres would have the type advantage in both attacking and defending. Additionally, this Legendary from Gen 8 gives off a dark aura so strong that most Pokémon aren&rsquo;t even capable of going near it. This effect would be extra strong against a Psychic-type Pokémon like Mewtwo.</p>
<p>10 Pokémon With The Wrong Types That Gen 10 Can Fix
Some Pokémon types really don’t seem to match up with the Pokémon themselves, perhaps at least a couple of these could be corrected in Gen 10.</p>
<p>Uxie Could Surprisingly Defeat Mewtwo, According To Lore
Uxie Could Just Remove Mewtwo&rsquo;s Memories</p>
<p>Uxie may be a surprising pick - and if it was a measure of its strength compared to Mewtwo’s, there would be no contest. Mewtwo would win. However, Uxie has an ace in the hole - anyone who looks into Uxie&rsquo;s eyes has their memories removed. All that would need to happen is for Uxie to open its eyes and look at Mewtwo. At that point, the Pokémon will lose its memory and could be calmed down or left open for a massive attack from Uxie.</p>
<p>Deoxys Is Actually Weaker Than Mewtwo
Mewtwo Beat Deoxys In The Manga</p>
<p>While a fight between Mewtwo and Deoxys would be fairly close, Mewtwo has been shown to be the victor in the manga. Despite Deoxys&rsquo; ability to swap between four different forms on a whim, Mewtwo outmatches Deoxys with its sheer Psychic power. Mewtwo’s attributes are more than capable enough to keep up with Deoxys’ form changes, meaning that this alien just doesn’t have the stuff to defeat Mewtwo. Deoxys&rsquo; tricks would, however, ensure that this flight goes down to the absolute wire.</p>
<p>Solgaleo Can&rsquo;t Win Against Mewtwo&rsquo;s Mega Evolutions
Solgaleo&rsquo;s Psychic Powers Can&rsquo;t Save It</p>
<p>Solgaleo has interesting typing as well as a powerful command over the sun. Despite essentially being a deity of the sun and possessing some Psychic powers of its own, it wouldn’t be able to defeat Mewtwo in a fight. Perhaps the story would be different if Mewtwo only had its standard form, but Mewtwo has two Mega Evolutions that make it one of the strongest Pokémon in existence. As a result, a Mega Evolved Mewtwo&rsquo;s immense Psychic powers would overwhelm Solgaleo, meaning that Mewtwo would inevitably become the victor.</p>
<p>Darkrai Surprisingly Can&rsquo;t Beat Mewtwo
Aura Sphere Gives Mewtwo The Advantage</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Darkrai would have a type advantage over Mewtwo, it wouldn’t beat Mewtwo in a battle. In the manga, there was someone who had been running away from Mewtwo for a time. However, it&rsquo;s told that he had a Darkrai at his side, suggesting that the sleeping powers of a Darkrai wouldn’t be enough to take down Mewtwo. Furthermore, Mewtwo can learn Aura Sphere, which would deal a critical blow to Darkrai, having a weakness to Fighting-type attacks.</p>
<p>Alakazam Can&rsquo;t Beat Mewtwo, Despite Being A Strong Non-Legendary
Not Even Mega Evolution Can Save Alakazam</p>
<p>Alakazam is one of the strongest non-Legendary Pokémon. Its Psychic abilities surpass many other Pokémon&rsquo;s. It also has the IQ of a supercomputer, meaning that it can process and reason beyond what any human would ever be capable of. Despite all of its feats and a Mega Evolution, though, Alakazam&rsquo;s Psychic abilities couldn&rsquo;t stand against Mewtwo&rsquo;s. Even in Mewtwo’s standard form, the fight might last a little while, but it&rsquo;s clear who would come out on top. Those spoons won’t save him now.</p>
<p>Koraidon Would Lose Against Mewtwo
Koraidon&rsquo;s Fighting-Type Is Weak To Psychic</p>
<p>Koraidon is one of the newest Legendaries, and on the cover of Pokémon Scarlet. It&rsquo;s certainly one of the strongest Gen 9 Pokémon, but it&rsquo;s a Fighting/Dragon-type. Fighting-types are weak against Psychic, which means Mewtwo would have the advantage. In fact, Mewtwo should be able to make quick work of Koraidon&rsquo;s Psychic weakness.</p>
