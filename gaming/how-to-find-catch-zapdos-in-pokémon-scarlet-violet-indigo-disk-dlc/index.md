## Literature Review

Zapdos can be found flying through the skies of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after completing the Indigo Disk DLC and receiving the Zapdos Treat.





Once the main story of The Indigo Disk has been completed in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, go to the entrance of the Blueberry Academy. As stated before, an NPC called Snacksworth will gift you treats after completing 10 BlueberryQuests or BBQs. These treats let you find Legendary Pokémon around the Paldrea, Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy maps.






If the Zapdos Treat isn&#39;t gifted to you right away, before talking to Snacksworth, save the game. Turn off the game and relaunch it, then speak to Snacksworth again. This can be done until the desired treat is needed.

 Best Way to Catch Zapdos in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk 
          

Be prepared while battling and catching Zapdos in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. A useful order of events in order to catch the Legendary Pokémon includes:

  Stock up on Quick Balls, Timer Balls, and Ultra Balls.   Make a team that can resist Electric- and Flying-type moves.   Add a Pokémon to the team that knows a status-inflicting move, such as Spore, Sleep Power, or Sing.   Find then save the game in front of Zapdos in case you run out of Pokéballs or healthy Pokémon.   Start the battle with a higher chance of catching it while using a Quick Ball.   Weaken Zapdos to a yellow or red health bar and inflict the Sleep status condition.   Use an Ultra Ball, and if the battle lasts more than 6 turns, start using a Timer Ball.   Alternatively, you can skip the above process and use a Master Ball to catch Indigo Disk Legendaries.
