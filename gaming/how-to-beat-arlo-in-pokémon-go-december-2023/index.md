 Arlo&#39;s Team For December 2023 In Pokémon GO 
          

Arlo made one change in November 2023, but no further changes have been made to his line-up for December, so if you faced off against him last month, there will be no surprises. Arlo&#39;s first Pokémon is now Generation 1, Grass- and Poison-type Bellsprout. His second Pokémon will be one of three at random out of Psychic-type Alakazam, Ghost-type Mismagius, or Water- and Dark-type Sharpedo.

Arlo&#39;s final Pokémon are all powerful Shadow versions in Pokémon GO, which will provide a tough test regardless of which option you face. It will be either Normal-type Snorlax, Bug- and Steel-type Scizor or Electric- and Steel-type Magnezone.

 Best Pokémon GO Counters For Arlo In December 2023 
          

Trainers should start against Arlo with a strong Fire-type Pokémon. Arlo will always start with Bellsprout in Pokémon GO, which is weak against fire attacks, so Charizard or Entei can both easily defeat it. Another good option is Chandelure. The Ghost- and Fire-type Pokémon can be set up with moves that can defeat Bellsprout while also being super-effective against Alakazam and Scizor.



Against Arlo it is vital to use a Fighting-type, such as Machamp, to defeat Snorlax.




Snorlax has a large amount of HP, which only a Fighting-type can easily defeat. Fighting- types also have an edge on Magnezone and Sharpedo, making them an excellent choice for this battle.




By selecting the above two types of Pokémon, you will be super-effective against everything Arlo has to offer, but using the powerful Dark- and Rock-type Tyranitar is a great backup option if needed. While not having a type advantage over many of Arlo&#39;s line-ups, he can easily beat most Pokémon in his locker. Arlo&#39;s line-up in December 2023 is varied and can cause Trainers problems, but he can be defeated using the right counters in Pokémon GO.
