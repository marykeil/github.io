## Literature Review

Soul Coins are rare items you can find within locations and quests in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that you may use to power up a specific companion in battle.





A Soul Coin does not weigh anything when in your inventory and is worth 10 Gold Pieces. While this item may not seem much at first, reading the &#34;Soul Coin: A Treatise&#34; will give you more information about this currency. If you have a high enough Arcana check, you can also use this item with the devils of Avernus.




  


 How To Find Every Soul Coin 
          

You can find 14 Soul Coins across the three Acts, but you shouldn&#39;t sell them in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for a quick buck. The Soul Item is an incredibly rare souvenir of the Nine Hells and has a different purpose other than collecting Soul Coins. The easiest one to collect comes by saving the NPC Nadira from a Bugbear assassin outside the Emerald Grove. You encounter Nadira as they look through a microscope before being attacked and receive the Coin by passing a Deception check in a conversation after the battle.



You do not have to save Nadira from the Bugbear to collect the Soul Coin; you can also loot it from her dead body or pickpocket her at any point to get the item.







The 13 other Soul Coins can be found in dungeons and tombs, and to know their exact location in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, follow the below table:

  Soul Coin   Location   How to Get    Soul Coin #1   Dank Crypt   Inside the room at the end of the dungeon with the giant sarcophagus to the south.    Soul Coin #2   West of the Crypt within a space with a large statue and the Entombed Acolyte bodies.    Soul Coin #3   Alongside the Amulet of Lost Voices found after you loot Wither&#39;s sarcophagus in the room behind the statue once your party defeats the undead acolytes.    Soul Coin #4   Moonrise Towers   If you have Karlach in your party, speak to the Bugbear NPC Lann Tarv, who tells three sad stories about trapped souls. For each one you listen through, they will give you a Soul Coin that keeps each being.    Soul Coin #5    Soul Coin #6    Soul Coin #7   Lower City, Philgrave&#39;s Mansion   During the quest to find Thrumbo in Act 3, go to this location and lockpick a stone door to the west of the house. The Soul Coin lies on a table full of body parts on the east end of the upper house guarded by ghoul enemies.    Soul Coin #8   The House of Hope   The home of the devil Raphael has a hidden safe past a trapped painting in the cambion&#39;s bedroom, guarded by the hostile NPC Haarlep. Disarm the trap and lockpick the safe to find the Soul Coin inside.    Soul Coin #9   Toll Collector&#39;s House   South of the Risen Road Waypoint, search for the Toll Collector&#39;s house, which hosts a Soul Coin on the top floor balcony.    Soul Coin #10   Reithwin Town Tollhouse   Under the Tollhouse, you will find a southern path leading to the docks below. Passing a Perception check here reveals a button that opens up a secret room, which has the Soul Coin on a nearby desk.    Soul Coin #11   Peartree House   As you follow the &#34;Murder Target: Frank&#34; quest indicator to discover other targets for assassination, you will easily pick up a Soul Coin from the house mailbox from this mark.    Soul Coin #12   Going to the basement of the Peartree house reveals two Soul Coins hidden in a strongbox you can pick open.    Soul Coin #13   






The official description for a Soul Coin reads, &#34;Strange, incomprehensible whispers emanate from this coin, pervading your mind with rage and despair.&#34; While this may cause you to worry, considering how other items are known to cause negative effects on your character in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, this ominous message doesn&#39;t do anything. There are also no described actions beyond those of a normal item.



 How To Use Soul Coins 
          

The primary purpose of a Soul Coin is to trigger Karlach&#39;s special ability when consumed. When you recruit Karlach in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, she can gain a condition called Infernal Fury that spends a single Soul Coin. However, Internal Fury only activates when she rages or is below 25% of her total health.

Once Internal Fure has been triggered, Karlauch gets an additional 1d4 of Fire damage until her rage status lasts or gets knocked out. This may not need a significant boss initially; however, this move comes in handy during Act 1 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.






Those who follow Karlach&#39;s quests may worry that dampening the effects of her Infernal Engine might prevent the Soul Coin effect from activating as a result. Thankfully, the results of these missions do not change how Soul Coins interact with Karlach.




Since Soul Coins are consumed whenever you activate Infernal Fury, you only have a limited number of uses, even if you have gathered every piece of this strange currency. The best party compositions in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can support Karlach without relying on Infernal Fury. Make sure to stockpile your Soul Coins and reserve their consumption to only situations where the extra damage would help the most.

When you find and use Soul Coins in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, keep in mind how many you have at your disposal compared to Karlach&#39;s condition during a fight to get the best out of these infernal pieces of money.
