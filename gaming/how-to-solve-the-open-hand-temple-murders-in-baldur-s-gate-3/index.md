## Literature Review

There are several murders to solve in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but the Open Hand Temple Murders will require a little more effort to solve than others.





The Open Hand Temple is a location to visit in Act 3 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and your party can immediately find a commotion when you arrive. Many people have gathered to discuss the murder of Father Logan with their theories about who killed the beloved figure. Starting this side quest could lead to a few rewards depending on your decisions based on the information your party finds.




  


 How To Start The Investigation 
          

Speak to the main investigator on the scene, a Hollyphant named Valeria, to begin this quest in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 after offering help to Sister Yannis. This detective seems to already know who murdered Logan and accuses the refugee Brilgor of the crime. Sister Yannis gives your party a few areas of interest to gather clues to prove whether Valeria&#39;s hunch is right.



One hidden place to get information is actually from Father Logan himself. Casting Speak with Dead on the murder victim lets you ask the corpse a few questions that give some crucial details.







A spellcaster who can talk to the dead in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can ask questions not only from Father Logan but also from the corpse of Brilgor. Unfortunately, Brilgor also died when the Temple murder took place, so you can&#39;t get their side of the story unless you use a bit of necromancy. The refugee&#39;s casket has to be dug up in the graveyard behind this area before you can use a spell on Brilgor&#39;s body.

Speaking to either Brilgor or Logan reveals that Brilgor was not the culprit behind the murder. Logan will tell you that a dwarf dressed in red killed him, but this is a relatively vague description of some characters in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Take this hint with you as your party continues to gather other clues from the scene of the murder itself in the basement of the Temple.



 How To Investigate The Crime Scene 
          




The crime scene is one of the areas Sister Yannis highlighted, but you can find a secret Ornate Wooden Hatch in the Kitchen that leads to a series of tunnels below the Temple. Traveling through this dark passage leads to a crypt you can explore. Go toward the room with an altar to start an unavoidable combat with a few enemies that will attack your group on sight in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.



Loot found from the bodies of the enemies you find around the altar can help solve two other quests in Acts 2 and 3, including the &#34;Help the Cursed Monk&#34; side mission from the former part of the story.




Press the buttons behind the crests in the wall near the altar to start the combat, which you must beat without completely destroying the bodies of each foe. This is because one of the enemies carries the Flower Key item in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 or one of the key items related to the murder. Those with a high enough Perception stat may also find a mysterious Hole near a platform leading to the water below this area.




Search the Hole to discover Stillmaker, or the murder weapon used to kill Father Logan in the first place. None of the bodies of enemies in the room will have anything more to say about the murder, so don&#39;t cast Speak with Dead on any of them unless you&#39;re curious to hear their perspective.

                  10 Deadliest Decisions You Can Make In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 lets you play as morally good or evil as you want, but it can be hard to know which choices result in deadly consequences.   



 Where To Use The Flower Key 
          

Your party must reach Fraygo&#39;s Flophouse to use the Flower Key, but this area could be difficult to travel towards, depending on your earlier choices in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. The Steel Watch guards the South Span Checkpoint that blocks your path to the Flophouse. If you have angered this policing force in the city, you may have to fight through or sneak past these guards to visit your destination.




Passing Wyrm&#39;s Crossing will put you on the right path to the Flophouse, where you can head upstairs and interact with a large wardrobe on the top floor. When you do this, a secret room opens up and displays another shocking murder. Grab the journal on the desk in this space to uncover the true culprits of Father Logan&#39;s death and this crime scene - the Bhaalist Cult in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

The journal lists not only Logan&#39;s name crossed out but also several other potential victims that the Cult plans to attack. This will set up future encounters and fights in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 that you can pursue to prevent others from dying to this murder-obsessed group.



 How To Solve The Murder 
          

Return to Valeria and give her the evidence found in the journal to complete the quest as you solve Logan&#39;s murder once and for all. This will prove Brilgor&#39;s innocence and allow your party to track down other instances of the Bhaalist Cult&#39;s plot. Since you eventually need to face Orin the Red, the leader of this group, any advantage over these enemies could be useful in Act 3.




Valeria is found on the second floor of Sharess&#39; Caress, a shop directly across from the Flophouse&#39;s location. If the Hollyphant is away from the shop, she may be involved in another quest your party will have to track down within the Lower City. Thankfully, anyone looking to solve the Open Hand Temple murder should be able to find Valeria in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 easily if they explore enough of their map.
