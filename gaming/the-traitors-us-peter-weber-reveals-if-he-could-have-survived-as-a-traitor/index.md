## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 brought The Bachelor&#39;s Peter Weber into a high-stakes strategy game, testing his abilities. Would he survive as a traitor?




The Traitors US season 2 brought The Bachelor’s Peter Weber into a high-stakes game of deceit, but could he handle playing the game as a traitor after being such a genuine Bachelor? The Traitors US season 2’s premiere released the first trio of episodes of the season, revealing the identities of the traitors and the first of the faithful eliminated from the game. While Peter, who’s known for his time as the lead of The Bachelor season 24, has been vocal about his relationships in the past, he’s never been part of a series that pushes players into a strategic mindset to keep themselves and their game alive.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant, Peter revealed the role he wanted coming into the game, which may be surprising to viewers. “I think everyone wanted to be a traitor. Again, you get so much power with traitor,” Peter explained, “[even though there’s] a lot of stress, too.” While he was hoping he’d be named a traitor, Peter was ultimately chosen as a faithful in the game and enlisted to help find the traitors. Peter felt that his background would make him a successful traitor in the game, as many wouldn’t expect him to be playing the devious role.

 How Peter’s Pilot Training Helped Him On The Traitors US 
          




In explaining his gameplay on The Traitors US season 2, Peter shared that he pulled some of his skills from his career as a pilot to help him to be alert. “In an airplane you always want to have really good situational awareness of all your surroundings, always observing everything, any kind of tell,” Peter shared. “[I was] just staying super analytical about it, and keep thinking with your head, and making smart, sound decisions, and observing your environment as best as possible.” Peter may not have had the same reality TV background as some of the strategic players, but his experiences helped him along the way.


 

As he was able to use the skills he’s acquired as a pilot to help him navigate the game, Peter was quick to make friends and keep tabs on people in the castle. As unexpected as it would be to see Peter in a traitor role, it’s clear he would’ve been capable of staying vigilant during his time on the series if he were chosen as a traitor. Within the first three episodes, Peter’s only been playing as a faithful, but it’s possible that in future episodes he could be recruited to the team on The Traitors US season 2 if one of the other traitors finds themselves banished.




With Peter aligning with Bling Empire’s Kevin Kreider during the early episodes of the series, he’s working to play the game strategically as he moves through the castle. Though he wasn’t chosen as a traitor in the initial stages of the game, Peter’s capabilities are strong. He’s spent the majority of his time in the game thus far observing his fellow players and surroundings, so in future episodes of The Traitors US season 2, it’s likely that viewers will see Peter taking a stand. Many hope he’ll be successful as he moves through the game and tries to identify the traitors in his midst.
