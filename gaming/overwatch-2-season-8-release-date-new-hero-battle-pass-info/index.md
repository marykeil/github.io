## Literature Review

A new hero provides a lot to look forward to in Overwatch 2 Season 8, as does one key rework to how the Battle Pass will work in the future.




Overwatch 2 Season 8 is arriving soon as the final season of 2023 (and first of 2024), and it should be bringing plenty with it to wrap up the year and ring in the new one. The game has had its fair share of ups and downs in 2023, with the May reveal that the long-anticipated PvE mode would never arrive in the form that was originally promised. Regular updates have proceeded without interruption, however, with a number of new heroes, maps, and modes, along with plenty of cosmetics to unlock.




Season 8 of Overwatch 2 is no exception, with a new tank hero being a particular highlight of the upcoming season. Also of interest is a revamp to the Battle Pass, which could address at least one of the concerns and frustrations that players have had with the system ever since its launch. Overwatch 2 features more aggressive monetization techniques than its paid predecessor, and choices like making heroes Battle Pass unlocks have steered it away from the original ethos centered around equal hero-swapping for everyone. That core change is unfortunately set to stay, but not everything will be stagnant.

                  Overwatch 2 Review: Missing More Than An Extra Tank   New &amp; veteran players will have fun with Overwatch 2&#39;s well-polished free multiplayer, but Battle Pass grind &amp; lack of anticipated modes hold it back.    


 When Overwatch 2 Season 8 Releases 
December 5, 2023
          




Overwatch 2 Season 8 will be arriving on December 5, 2023, the same day that Season 7 is making its exit. Based on last year&#39;s schedule, this should be one week before the annual Winter Wonderland event starts, bringing festive holiday spirit, skins, and map overhauls to the game for the duration of the holiday season. The season is likely to run until early February, as seasons have consistently run for roughly three-month periods, mostly adhering to Tuesday start and end dates according to tradition.



 Who Overwatch 2 Season 8&#39;s New Hero Is 
Mauga (Tank)
         

The new hero of Overwatch 2 Season 8 is Mauga, the first new tank since the Season 2 hero Ramattra. A trial period on November 3 already made him playable for a weekend, available live across all modes except for Competitive. Come December 5, Mauga will be available instantly to anyone who purchases the Season 8 Premium Battle Pass or upon reaching Tier 45 in the free alternative. Missing out on Season 8 shouldn&#39;t mean missing out on the new hero permanently, as completing hero challenges typically offers a way to unlock new additions later on.




Mauga is meant to be played as an aggressive tank, with offensive features that support his ability to stay alive on the battlefield. Mauga&#39;s principal damage dealing comes in the form of two chain guns – Gunny and Cha-Cha – which work as a pair to ignite enemies and then crit them while they&#39;re aflame. Crit damage gives Mauga temporary health thanks to the Berserker passive, meaning the best defense is a good offense. An ability called Overrun serves a similar role to Reinhardt&#39;s Charge with a Doomfist-like stomp at the end, and Cardiac Overdrive reduces incoming damage to nearby allies while offering healing in exchange for damage dealt.

                  A Deep Dive on New Brawler Tank Mauga with The Overwatch 2 Team   Members of the Overwatch 2 team discuss the game&#39;s 39th hero Mauga, a fiery tank brawler with a nasty new ult.    

Mauga&#39;s ultimate ability is Cage Fight, which deploys a cylindrical barrier to trap players inside. He has unlimited ammo while the effect persists, giving him a good chance to mow down opponents at close range. Throughout all of this violence, Mauga can remain cheery and outgoing, with a boisterous personality that he claims emerged after the augmentation of his size and strength. He&#39;s responsible for at least one act of kindness, letting Baptiste go off the radar to break free of Talon during an operation, but this seems like the exception to the rule.






 What Overwatch 2 Season 8&#39;s Battle Pass Entails 
Mythic Skins From Earlier OW2 Seasons Can Be Earned
          

The Battle Pass for Season 8 of Overwatch 2 should work in the same basic way as prior passes, albeit with one tweak to rewards. All players will have access to a free tier, while purchasing the Season 8 Battle Pass will unlock more a more expansive and impressive roster of rewards as progress is made. Like Battle Passes starting with Season 5 and continuing onward, the Season 8 battle pass should have an overall theme and identity to guide what&#39;s included, addressing complaints from the earlier seasons that Battle Passes could be a bit too random overall.

The big change to the Overwatch 2 Season 8 battle pass lies in how Mythic skins are distributed. Reaching a high tier of the Battle Pass has always been the requirement to unlock a new Mythic skin each season, which offers extensive design details and customization that exceeds even the bar set by Legendaries. From Season 8 onward, players will be allowed to select past Mythic skins that they haven&#39;t yet unlocked instead of the current one if they choose, making it possible to acquire high-priority Mythics of the past with the premium Battle Pass.






Overwatch 2 has featured seven Mythic skins so far, starting with Cyber Demon Genji from Season 1 of the Battle Pass, and most recently adding Onryō Hanzo for Season 7.






 The Future Of Overwatch 2 After Season 8 
New DPS &amp; Support Heroes
          

Blizzard hasn&#39;t laid out a specific roadmap for the future of Overwatch 2 past Season 8, but the developer has made some specific plans clear. After Mauga, new characters will be coming in the form of the DPS hero Venture and a support hero codenamed Space Ranger. A competitive rework is planned for Season 9, which will provide more transparency about ranking up and down as detailed in a video available on the official PlayOverwatch Twitter account, as well as a new rank above Grandmaster called Ultimate, new Emerald weapon rewards a rank reset for all players, and an overhauled placement system.





 

The recently added Hero Mastery system will get some additions with a 3-player co-op mode called Gauntlet and new missions for D.va, Echo, Genji, Lucio, and Mei. A new game mode Clash will return to a reworked Hanamura (now called Hanaoka). These plans should offer plenty to look forward to in the coming seasons, although details on scheduling are still generally vague. For now, Overwatch 2 Season 8 can provide the new hero Mauga and an improved system of acquiring Mythic skins through the Battle Pass when December 5 finally rolls around.
