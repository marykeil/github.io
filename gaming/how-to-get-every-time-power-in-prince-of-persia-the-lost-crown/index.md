## Literature Review

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has six time powers that alter how Sargon can travel across the battlefield and the city of Mount Qaf on his quest.

However, when you come across paths that are too far to access, you may want to know when you can go back and explore this hidden area.




                  10 Best Amulets To Equip First in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   Amulets provide powerful buffs for Sargon in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, but the best abilities to equip first depend on each item&#39;s potential.   


 All Time Powers In Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown 
          

Most Time Powers in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown appear as an otherworldly, glowing feather known as the Feather of Simurgh. By obtaining it, Sargon can manipulate time just the right way to get an edge over his enemies in combat. Each Time Power plays into the game&#39;s themes of time manipulation by skipping Sargon back and forth along his timeline.

 Time Power  Abilities   Rush of the Simurgh  Sargon can dash back and forth while in the air, allowing him to cross chasms and avoid falling to his doom.   Shadow of the Simurgh  Sargon can mark his current location, placing a clone on that spot. By reactivating the time power, Sargon teleports back to that location, looping around enemies and obstacles.   Dimensional Claw  Sargon can trap an enemy or item in a pocket dimension and fling it out to another location. This allows him to throw explosive flowers at cave-ins, unlocking hidden paths.   Clairvoyance  Sargon can see invisible enemies, platforms, and other objects, allowing him to better traverse Mount Qaf.   Gravity Wings  With the Gravity Wings, Sargon can now double-jump.   Fabric of Time  Sargon can now grapple items and enemies while flinging himself to hard-to-reach spots on the map. He can also pull down gates.   








 Where To Find All Six Time Powers In Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown 
          

Most Feathers of Simurgh and their associated time power are rewards for defeating specific bosses found in the game&#39;s main story. Rush of the Simurgh, for example, is a reward for beating Jahandar in Prince of Persia: TLC during &#34;The Abducted Prince,&#34; the second quest in the main story. This boss battle requires careful parrying and dodging while wielding the right amulets and items.

Later on, in &#34;The Tiger and The Rat,&#34; you will stumble upon an evil clone of Sargon, acting as a major boss of the game&#39;s third story quest. So long as you can avoid Alternate Sargon&#39;s powerful attack, Arash&#39;s Ray, defeating him should not be too hard. Upon his defeat, you will have access to Shadow of the Simurgh.

                  8 Beginner Tips You Need To Know For Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown   The combat and exploration of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be confusing for beginners, but a few tips can mold Sargon into a great warrior.   




&#34;The Path To The Sand Prison&#34; quest features two of Sargon&#39;s time powers: one locked behind a boss, the other behind a puzzle. If you want Dimensional Claw, you must beat Kiana, The Forest Queen, a powerful boss in the Hyracian Forest. Meanwhile, to unlock Clairvoyance, you will have to solve the time puzzles in the Sacred Archive.

While Gravity Wings appear in the fifth main quest, &#34;The Darkest of Souls,&#34; you won&#39;t unlock it immediately after a boss battle. Yes, you will still have to beat Azhdaha when he appears, but afterward, you will have to summon a Celestial Guardian. Only after summoning the Celestial Guardian will you find the next Feather of Simurgh.

The sixth and last time power, Fabric of Time, appears during &#34;Return To The Past.&#34; If you want this ability, you will have to defeat Varham, who has his own difficult and damaging parries. If you&#39;re successful, however, you will have access to every time power in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.
