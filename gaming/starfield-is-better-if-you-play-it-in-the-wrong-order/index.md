# Starfield Is Better If You Play It In The Wrong Order


## SUMMARY 



  Starfield is best experienced in New Game Plus (NG&#43;), so it&#39;s recommended to rush through the main story on the first playthrough.   NG&#43; offers a ton of new content, making it a more enjoyable experience with additional challenges when players haven&#39;t already completed everything.   For multiple playthroughs, players should prioritize the campaign on the first run, focus on side content on the second and third runs, and experiment with the galaxy sandbox in subsequent NG&#43; runs.

## Literature Review

Starfield encourages a certain kind of play, but in fact, doing the exact opposite might be better. Hereâ€™s how to get the most out of NG&#43;.




Starfield is just more fun when played out of order. Of course, as an open-world, at times sandbox-like RPG, there&#39;s no one single, inevitable order in which everyone will experience its content. Most will take it in whatever way they like. Do a little of the main story, get embroiled in Starfield&#39;s faction quests, see a pretty planet and get distracted, start an outpost there and forget everything else until it&#39;s up and running, so on and so forth. There are a million ways to play the game, and once the tutorial is completed, almost nothing to prevent anyone from going anywhere they want.




But of course, there&#39;s still a prescribed way to complete Starfield, even if it&#39;s only implicit. It&#39;s the same old open-world RPG formula Bethesda has been operating on for decades: encouraging players to take their time, explore, and do whatever side content they like, knowing the rest of it will still be there when they return. However, with Starfield&#39;s unique approach to New Game Plus, that doesn&#39;t seem so appealing. There are arguments for both sides, and in the first weeks after release, it was hard to say whether players should rush into Starfield&#39;s New Game Plus or take their time. Now, it&#39;s possible to give a more universal answer.

 Rush Through Starfield&#39;s Story First, Then Do Side Content On NG&#43; 
          




The majority of Starfield is best experienced in NG&#43;, so it&#39;s best to rush through the main story, at least on a first playthrough. As tempting as it may be to explore the wider galaxy, there&#39;s just so much more fun to be had on NG&#43;. Players who try to complete everything the first time around may actually be missing out on a better experience. They&#39;re wasting more time on what will almost certainly be a less interesting playthrough, borrowing novel discoveries from their future selves. They&#39;re also risking becoming burnt out on Starfield earlier, and missing out on the magic of a second playthrough.

That&#39;s not even to mention how repetitive and tedious it&#39;d be to complete all Starfield has to offer in the first run. It&#39;d take hundreds of hours, if not more, with little in the way of variation to break up the monotony. Here are a few reasons why it&#39;s best to speed through a first run and slow down for the following, and a quick guide to what&#39;s worth focusing on each time around.






 Starfield Is Better On New Game Plus 
Starfield&#39;s NG&#43; Adds New Armor, New Ships, And New Content
         

There are many things that improve the Starfield experience on NG&#43;. Of course, the most obvious thing is that the player character keeps all the levels and skills gained during their first playthrough. As a result, they&#39;ll likely be incredibly overleveled for early game content, and can breeze through it quickly if they want the extra loot. Of course, they can also just skip the main story and head straight for side content, but difficulty shouldn&#39;t be much more of a concern there. At NG&#43; levels, players can explore even the most crushingly difficult exoplanets with little concern.

Starfield&#39;s NG&#43; also changes the base game, with a variety of different universes available for players to spawn into. These all have to do with the various members of Constellation, and range from the absolutely tragic to the downright absurd. The player character may start a NG&#43; run only to find that the Hunter has already killed all the members of Constellation, or that Sarah Morgan has seemingly been turned into a plant.




There&#39;s also plenty of brand-new side content, like an unmarked quest that reveals the identity of Starfield&#39;s Mysterious Captain. NG&#43; also unlocks new space suits, new ship customization options, and new items to buy or sell. There&#39;s way more to do the second time around, and there&#39;s even more if players haven&#39;t already completed all the side content going into it.

If they choose to go through the campaign again, players will also know the results of their choices on NG&#43;. In a way, they&#39;re able to see the future, and can better influence the story&#39;s outcome. Not happy with how the player character left things with a faction, or lost someone dear at the Lodge or the Eye? On a second playthrough, they can literally turn back time, undoing every unwise decision they made on their first try.



 The Best Way To Experience Multiple Playthroughs Of Starfield 
          




So on the first playthrough of Starfield, it&#39;s best to rush through the story. Of course, players can take a little time to do whatever side content they find most interesting, but shouldn&#39;t get bogged down in it. The campaign should be their first priority at all costs, unless they really need to gain a few levels to take on the next quest, or there&#39;s an expensive piece of equipment they&#39;re gunning for. But what comes after?

For their second Starfield playthroughs, players should skip the main story entirely, and focus solely on side content for almost the entire time. This would be a good opportunity to get to know all the factions and the people in them, and decide which stories they&#39;d be interested in revisiting in future runs. There&#39;s a little more wiggle room here - with all their levels from the first run, players shouldn&#39;t need to spend much time grinding the second time around. But there will be new, pricier equipment available, and if they need a few extra credits to afford it, starting an outpost or two wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing.




On the third save, players can tackle whatever side content they want to revisit from previous runs, making different choices at pivotal moments to see what&#39;s different. Now would be a good time to take note of which story outcomes they&#39;re happiest with, so that they can recreate them in a future universe.

In a fourth NG&#43; and beyond, players can create their ideal universes by making all the right choices in the main and side missions, then settling down to make tons of money exploring the galaxy. At this point, Starfield becomes a gleefully absurd power fantasy, and the player its omnipotent god. Now&#39;s the time to colonize as many planets as possible, steal everything they can get their hands on, and rack up tons of credits. Players can go wherever they want, pick whatever fights they want and take whatever they want. The galaxy is their oyster.

But this is still just one of the infinite possible ways to experience Starfield. Even those who follow this trajectory will all do it differently, choosing different faction quests to repeat, planets to colonize, and characters to romance each time. This particular method is mostly interesting because it progresses from a campaign-focused shooter to a side quest-heavy RPG to a sandbox game. That may not sound ideal to everyone, so in the end, the choice is totally up to each individual Starfield player.
