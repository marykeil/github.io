## Literature Review

Despite its hardware limitations, the Nintendo Switch shines as the definitive platform for a significant library of great roleplaying games.




The Nintendo Switch isn&#39;t always the best way to play multiplatform games, but sometimes it stands out as the absolute best option, especially when it comes to RPGs. Roleplaying games are often long and grindy, and gaining the ability to take them on the go can significantly increase the odds of actually seeing the end of an adventure. There are also plenty of great roleplaying games with artstyles that translate nicely to the Switch, maintaining visual fidelity and performance even on limited hardware capabilities.
For an RPG to be better on the Switch, it needs to be an enjoyable game to take on the go, so anything that plays especially poorly on a small screen or in quick sessions is out. It should also look and play reasonably comparably to its appearance on other platforms, which can make even great games like The Witcher 3 hard sells on the platform. Other excellent titles like Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire and Divinity: Original Sin 2 play better with a mouse and keyboard, so there isn&#39;t a very strong argument for tackling them with the joycons or pro controller.
            
 
 10 Best Nintendo Switch Games Right Now 
The Nintendo Switch offers an incredible array of fantastic games covering every genre to truly have something for everyone on one versatile system.












 








 10  Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book DX (2021) 
Developer: Gust
        

Atelier Sophie: The Mysterious of the Mysterious Book is the perfect RPG for anyone who wants cozy vibes to take precedence over world-shaking events, with an engaging gameplay loop that mixes together alchemy and classic turn-based battles. Although Atelier Ryza has played a larger share in the franchise&#39;s popularity in recent years, Atelier Sophie is a great starting point and takes less of a graphical hit on the Switch. The low-key nature and relaxed pace make it perfect for on-the-go play, and there&#39;s no time limit to cause stress in this one.

 9  Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition (2019) 
Developer: Namco Tales Studio
        

The storied Tales Of RPG franchise has had its ups and downs, but Tales of Vesperia is certainly one of the ups. Its origins on the Xbox 360 and PS3 ensure that it has no trouble running on the Switch, and the Definitive Edition brings extra content and improvements to a Western release for the first time, making it the best way to play. Although Tales of Vesperia doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel, a strong cast of characters and a fun action combat system make for an engaging experience.





 8  Octopath Traveler 2 (2023) 
Developer: Square Enix
        

The HD-2D style of the original Octopath Traveler made a big splash as an exciting way to marry classic pixel graphics and modern technology, and Octopath Traveler 2 delivers another beautiful adventure in the style that works perfectly on the Switch. It also improves on the weak points of the first games, particularly in creating a more involved story for its disparate crew of adventurers. As the unusual name might imply, each of the eight characters has their own narrative, and watching everything come together is wonderful.

Octopath Traveler 2 does enough to push its core systems a little further, but remains firmly in the realm of great, not transcendent. 








 7  Sea of Stars (2023) 
Developer: Sabotage Studio


 







Sea of Stars set its sights high by taking cues from masterpieces like Chrono Trigger, and it luckily manages to stick the landing. Detailed pixel graphics look lovely on the Nintendo Switch, and the Super Mario RPG-inspired combat feels right at home on the platform. If any one indie RPG should be in every Switch library, Sea of Stars seems like a perfect choice, especially for anyone who loves Japanese classics of the genre.

Sea of Stars is a fantastic turn-based RPG, with a refined and engaging combat system to keep players involved for its entire adventure.








 6  Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age (2019) 
Developer: Square Enix
        

If Definitive Edition is the best way to play Tales of Vesperia, The Zodiac Age might well be seen as the only way to play Final Fantasy 12, with a job system and various tweaks that address most major complaints against the original game. Like most Final Fantasy games, it tells an intriguing story and showcases a fascinating world that looks fantastic on the Switch. It isn&#39;t as common of a favorite as Final Fantasy 7, but no other title in the series fits so well on the Switch.





 5  Star Ocean: The Second Story R (2023) 
Developer: Square Enix
        

Star Ocean is a storied RPG franchise that never quite landed a single towering achievement, but The Second Story might have been the closest it ever got. Star Ocean: The Second Story R doubles back to polish up that experience in a shiny new package, employing a tweaked HD-2D style for a gorgeous update that works nicely on the Switch. Changes to the battle system also pick up the pace for more consistent excitement, making it the perfect first-time experience.





 4  Persona 5 Royal (2022) 
Developer: Atlus


 







With a busy enough schedule or a heavy tendency to travel, playing Persona 5 Royal on the Nintendo Switch might actually be the only way to beat it. A 100-hour main story can make picking the game up seem daunting, but doubts tend to vanish quickly thanks to the engaging gameplay and story. The stylish presentation holds up reasonably well on the Switch, as Persona 5 Royal was originally developed for a cross-generation PlayStation 3 and 4 release.

 3  The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim (2017) 
Developer: Bethesda Game Studios


 







The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim has famously been ported to everything, but no destination is better than the Nintendo Switch. Wandering through its rich world makes so much sense on a hybrid console, and it even takes advantage of the joycons to provide motion control options for aiming bows and spellcasting. It may not have the mod support that the PC version has curated for over a decade, but the Switch is the perfect way to play vanilla Skyrim for the first or fifth time.





 2  Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition (2020) 
Developer: Monolith Soft
        

Although Xenoblade Chronicles has always been exclusive to Nintendo platforms, the original game showed up on the Wii and 3DS before landing on the Switch in its Definitive Edition. This is the ultimate form of the game: improving graphics, fixing problems, and adding content for the shiniest package yet. Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition stands out from other RPGs thanks to its massive world, unique combat system, and compelling themes, and it&#39;s easy to see why a fan movement for its original Western localization gained so much traction.





 1  Dragon Quest 11 S (2019) 
Developer: Square Enix
        

Dragon Quest 11 S is a fantastic port, miraculously retaining a decent chunk of what made the original PS4 release graphically impressive while adding content and souping up the game in a number of regards. It&#39;s a great game in any form, and every release since has been based on the Switch port. Truly classic JRPG combat and style meet a surplus of modern polish in a thrilling adventure that makes Dragon Quest 11 a near-perfect RPG on the Nintendo Switch that no one should ignore.
