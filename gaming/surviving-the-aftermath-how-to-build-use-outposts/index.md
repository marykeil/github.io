## Literature Review

Surviving the Aftermath has a World Map that players can explore and set up Outposts on in order to continuously gather valuable resources.





Since Surviving the Aftermath is a city-builder, players will first need to construct an Outpost Depot building in their colony by using 50 Wood, 45 Plastic, and 30 Metal. The resources can be traded or collected at the colony using a specific type of collector for each material. Once the Outpost Depot is built, players will be able to send a Specialist to it. The Specialist will be gone once they become a Settler, so players need to make sure they don&#39;t get rid of too many Specialists at once. After a Settler is created, they will be transported to the World Map so an Outpost can be built.




                  Surviving the Aftermath: Specialist Guide (Tips, Tricks, &amp; Strategies)   The various types of Specialists are used in Surviving the Aftermath to explore the World Map, scout new areas, create Outposts, and more.   


 Building Outposts in Surviving the Aftermath 
          

There are two Major Outpost types that players can build: regular Outposts and Engineer Outposts. There will only be one allowed in each sector, so players may need to demolish certain Outposts to make room for more valuable ones. Unlike Engineer Outposts in Surviving the Aftermath, the regular Outposts aren&#39;t required to complete the main story.



Players will need to unlock the Outpost Depot using Science Points in the Safety branch of the Tech Tree.







Placing an Outpost in the right spot on the World Map can be tricky as only one type of Outpost can be placed, but there may be multiple resources available. It will likely come down to which resource players need most. For example, if a Pandemic catastrophe is coming or has already hit the colony, players may need to stock up on medical supplies. Placing a Scavenger Outpost in a sector with medical resources available will be the most beneficial in that case.

                  Surviving the Aftermath: Best Ways to Spend Science Points   Players need to collect Science Points in order to perform research tasks in Surviving the Aftermath, but choosing what to research can be unclear.   

There are five sub-categories of Outposts in Surviving the Aftermath that collect specific resources: Research, Transport Station, Survivor, Scavenger, and Medical.

 Outpost Type  Description   Transport Station  Send back collected materials without having to return to the colony.   Medical Outpost  Heal characters without having to return to the colony.   Research Outpost  Collect Science Points automatically.   Scavenger Outpost  Collect materials automatically.   Survivor Outpost  Recruit a specific number of colonists automatically and send them to the colony.   






Determining which Outpost to build will require some assessment of the available resources. Depending on what&#39;s needed and what catastrophes players may be facing. No matter what type of Outpost you choose, you will need to sacrifice a Specialist to build it. Surviving the Aftermath is full of decisions that can affect the rest of the colony and Outposts are among the most important.
