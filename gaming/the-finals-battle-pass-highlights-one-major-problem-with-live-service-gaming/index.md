# The Finals  Battle Pass Highlights One Major Problem With Live-Service Gaming


## SUMMARY 



  The Finals&#39; Battle Pass is time-consuming and requires players to invest exorbitant amounts of time to complete it.   Battle passes in online games can make the experience feel like an obligation rather than a joy, limiting players&#39; exploration of other games and hindering the growth of alternative options.   Other games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Halo Infinite have implemented more player-friendly battle pass systems, offering quality-of-life benefits and better rewards, setting a standard for what battle passes should be.

## Literature Review

The Finals is fun, but its Battle Pass is putting in work to offset the highlights of the experience in a way that shows larger industry problems.




The Finals is a big breakout hit, offering an FPS experience that isn&#39;t quite like anything else on the market, but its Battle Pass shows where the game comes up short in a way that exemplifies many players&#39; frustrations with the industry. As a free-to-play title, it didn&#39;t take long for The Finals to attract a major audience with dynamic destructible environments and fast-paced gunplay. Retaining that popularity could be trickier, however, as the game is currently pushing up against the limits of what can be easily tolerated in some regards.




Any widespread criticism of The Finals has never particularly focused on its blood-pumping gameplay, which has gone over well with its target audience. Nonetheless, issues with the Battle Pass aren&#39;t the first thing that the game has come under fire over, with some earlier negative buzz focusing on the use of AI voice acting to cover the wide breadth of announcements made in its game show style. The Finals is a very modern product in ways both good and bad, and personal interest in the experience can depend on individual tolerance for the bad.

 The Finals&#39; Battle Pass Takes Too Long To Complete 
Completing The Battle Pass Can Take 100&#43; Hours
          




As is essentially the standard for modern live-service titles, The Finals uses a Battle Pass as a major mechanic for monetization, doling out rewards based on progress made through playtime. A free version of the Battle Pass spaces out a smaller number of rewards across levels, while paying for the upgraded experience unlocks more consistent momentum with a steady rate of one unlock for each tier. The big problem is just how long the Battle Pass takes, as The Finals seems to demand that anyone who wants to invest in the system should be willing to spend exorbitant amounts of time on the game to get their money&#39;s worth.

In general, earning enough XP to rank up each level in the Battle Pass averages out to about an hour of playtime, so anyone expecting to clear the 100-level run within the season needs to be willing to dedicate 100 hours to the game. The season runs for a little over three months, so it&#39;s doable within that time frame for anyone with a solid chunk of free time, but it essentially demands that anyone who wants to complete it should make The Finals their gaming priority. The long-term implications feel even more dire, as The Finals essentially expects fans to do this every season if they want to avoid permanently missing out on rewards.






 Battle Passes Are An Exhausting Live-Service Standard 
The Finals Is Just One Of Many Ongoing Games
          

Although The Finals has a worse battle pass than most games, it&#39;s also just one piece of a larger picture that makes modern online games frustrating for many. Ideally, players should be eager to log on because of the gameplay itself, and aggressively pushing extrinsic motivation through a battle pass can quickly make a game feel like an obligation rather than a joy. Ignoring battle passes entirely is often the best move, but games with an emphasis on them tend to make the experience feel more threadbare for anyone who isn&#39;t willing to play into the system.

The general gaming market also benefits from a community that&#39;s invested in a diverse array of online games, and battle passes tend to corral fanbases into spending more time on a smaller number of titles. Realistically, most players can only hope to earn a good chunk of rewards in one or two games at a time, disincentivizing them from exploring other options and making it harder for some fun alternatives to gain traction. Some games that used to feature less aggressive monetization have now transitioned to battle pass systems, with Overwatch 2 infamously abandoning its equal playing field by locking characters behind progression.




                  Oh, So Overwatch 2 Really Was All About The Money   A change in plans for Overwatch 2&#39;s PvE has disappointed many players, and the game&#39;s focus on monetization has never been more frustrating.   



 Other Games Have Better Battle Passes Than The Finals 
Fortnite, Apex Legends, &amp; Halo Infinite Are More Forgiving
          

Although no battle pass system is exactly wonderful, plenty of games have managed to implement systems that are less obnoxious than what The Finals has employed. Fortnite can also be exhausting, but it features some quality-of-life benefits that are lacking in The Finals, most notably in weekly quests that persist beyond the 7-day cycle and the ability to earn enough currency through a pass to buy the next one. Epic Games experimented with expiring weeklies in Fortnite around the end of 2022, a move that proved unpopular enough to necessitate fairly quick backtracking.




Halo Infinite might be the best example of a troubled online game listening to its community and responding in meaningful ways, going from a brutal progression system at launch to one that now sets a standard for what battle passes should be. Cosmetics that used to be locked to specific armors now work across sets, free players get a streamlined progression of rewards, and the most recent Winter Contingency seasonal event doubles past offerings with 20 free rewards for all. Most significantly, Halo Infinite&#39;s seasonal content includes Battle Passes that never expire, and old ones can be equipped at any time to make progress without any fear of permanently missing out on rewards.



 Battle Passes Need To Be Better When Games Release 
The Finals Shouldn&#39;t Be Immune From Criticism If It Fixes Things
         

It&#39;s entirely possible that The Finals will respond to backlash and make some improvements to its Battle Pass, but even if it does, there&#39;s no excuse for the current state of affairs. Games have been launching with aggressive battle passes and easing up over time for years, and each successive infraction is less justifiable. It&#39;s hard to shake the impression that companies are testing the waters to see just how much players will put up with before dialing things back to that exact limit, and the bare minimum doesn&#39;t need to be celebrated when it&#39;s all exhausting.




The Battle Pass in The Finals would benefit from faster progression, persisting weekly challenges, and the ability to save past battle passes for later completion, and asking for these simple allowances shouldn&#39;t be considered a particularly heavy demand. It&#39;s easy for launch hype around multiplayer titles to die off quickly, and failing to respond to criticisms might be the easiest way for The Finals to lose the momentum it has so far. Like many other live-service games, The Finals just has too much weighing down a fun core, and it needs to shed some of that baggage if it&#39;s ever going to live up to its potential.
