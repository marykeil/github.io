# Call Of Duty Isn t The Best-Selling Game Of The Year, Breaking A 5-Year Tradition


## SUMMARY 



  After five years of dominance, Call of Duty has been dethroned as the best-selling game in the United States.   This is only the third time since 2009 that a game other than Call of Duty has claimed the top spot.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 still managed to be the year&#39;s second best-selling game, topped only by Hogwarts Legacy.

## Literature Review

For only the third time since 2009 Call of Duty has failed to be the best-selling game in the US, but the bestseller isn’t much of a surprise.




For the first time in five years, Call of Duty has failed to be the best-selling game in the United States. The Activision-published series has become a yearly blockbuster event in the gaming industry, but even impressive – if expected – sales of Modern Warfare 3 weren&#39;t enough to top the 2023 sales chart. It was Avalanche Software&#39;s Hogwarts Legacy which managed to unseat the reigning franchise, usurped by another incredibly popular media property.




Sales figures come courtesy of GamesIndustry.biz, which cites Circana for its US sales data. This marks the first time a Call of Duty game wasn&#39;t the year&#39;s bestseller since Red Dead Redemption 2 took the prize in 2018. Even then, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 once again took second place.


 

According to the GamesIndustry.biz infographic, Hogwarts Legacy topped a US bestsellers category in which 10 games were listed:

 1  Hogwarts Legacy   2  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3   3  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   4  Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2   5  Madden NFL 24   6  Diablo 4   7  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2   8  Star Wars Jedi: Survivor   9  Mortal Kombat 1   10  Starfield   






Hogwarts Legacy managed to earn the most sales in the United Kingdom as well, but the market in Japan was dominated by Nintendo Switch titles lead by Tears of the Kingdom. Interestingly, TOTK has an asterisk in the infographic denoting that its digital sales were not included. Nintendo tends not to disclose digital sales numbers, and accounting for physical-only not only makes its bronze medal in the US more impressive, but suggests it potentially could have earned one of the top two spots if digital sales had been tallied.

 Call Of Duty Has Been A Perennial Bestseller For Over A Decade 
          




Second place can&#39;t be considered any sort of failure, especially considering residual sales of 2022&#39;s Modern Warfare 2 propelled it to 2023&#39;s seventh place (although this isn&#39;t quite as impressive as in 2020 or 2021, when CoD games were both the bestseller and the runner-up). It speaks more to the continued popularity of the Harry Potter brand, otherwise referred to as the Wizarding World franchise. In fact, Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s accomplishment is quite an outlier considering the other titles that managed to beat Call of Duty in sales since the series began yearly releases.

Since the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was released in 2009, there have only been two years when a game other than CoD was the bestseller: 2013 and 2018. The latter&#39;s top spot was claimed by the aforementioned Red Dead Redemption 2, and it was another outing from Rockstar Games, Grand Theft Auto 5, that claimed the sales crown in 2013. Taking into account the slower pace at which Rockstar has released its last few games, each one becomes a watershed release. Grand Theft Auto 6 smashing the trailer views record set by GTA 5 within a matter of days is a testament to this still being the case, so Rockstar&#39;s titles being the bane of Call of Duty isn&#39;t especially surprising.




                  Hogwarts Legacy Review: A Living, Breathing, Wizarding World   Hogwarts Legacy beautifully recreates the world of Harry Potter and fills it with quirky characters, tense combat, and a huge amount of collectibles.   

Hogwarts Legacy publisher Warner Bros. Games is no slouch – it cracked the top 10 in 2011 with Batman: Arkham City, and has bestsellers from the ever-popular LEGO and Mortal Kombat series – but developer Avalanche Software&#39;s only other claim to sales fame is Disney Infinity from 2013. As an open-world game in the Harry Potter universe, Hogwarts Legacy fulfilled something of a collective desire, attracting an incredibly wide audience. Call of Duty not topping the best-selling games chart for the first time in five years is a bit surprising, but Hogwarts Legacy being the game to usurp it certainly isn&#39;t.
