## Literature Review

Starfield&#39;s massive scope opens the way to a ton of secret encounters. With the right selections, players can find some hilarious special dialogue.




One of the funniest interactions in Starfield is pretty easy to miss. With a game so expansive, many of the tiny details are bound to fly under the radar of the majority of players. These events are made even rarer when they involve unique combinations of items and quests that few players would have thought to experiment with, but they can sometimes lead to hilarious results.




One of the benefits of having such a massive, interactive world is that it offers players many opportunities to make choices to shape their playthroughs; it’s a great feeling when such choices are reflected in the game. In the case of Bethesda games, this feeling is particularly enjoyable in the form of odd encounters with quirky dialogue. This is precisely what happens in Starfield if players wear the Monster Costume – obtained from the “Tourists Go Home” quest on New Homestead – in specific locations.

                  &#34;An Instant Classic&#34;: Starfield Review   Starfield has plenty of captivating tales and dynamic mechanics that make it an epic science fiction adventure - and an instant classic.    


 Players Can Wear Starfield’s Monster Costume To Hilarious Effect 
         




Reddit user Bombtree discovered hilarious interaction when wearing the Monster Costume while first boarding the ECS Constant during the “First Contact” quest. The crew, who feared alien life may be coming aboard the ship, first reacts with disgusted curiosity, then quickly deduces that the player is wearing a silly costume. Unique dialogue like this is always a delight to discover, and Bethesda has a knack for this.


 

Similar interactions in Starfield can be experienced when players use the gear acquired from the “Mantis&#34; side quest. It also feels reminiscent of the Silver Shroud attire in Fallout 4. This outfit changed how the player character spoke and opened alternate interactions with some NPCs. It’s a clever and fun way to reflect player agency in the game world, even with the most minor choices like apparel.

 Starfield’s Monster Costume Interaction Shows How Effective NG&#43; Can Be 
          

This unique interaction demonstrates the exciting possibilities that can happen in Starfield’s New Game Plus. The whole purpose of the New Game Plus dialogue options is to be a meta commentary on how players experience replaying games, already knowing what will happen. While this interaction can occur in a first playthrough since the interaction doesn’t require the use of Starborn dialogue, Bombtree’s video reveals that this particular instance happened in an NG&#43; playthrough. For first-time players, it’s improbable to have known that the ECS Constant would harbor humans. It’s even more unlikely for a first-time player to have been wearing the Monster Costume when doing this quest.




It’s more likely for an experienced player to wonder what could happen if they did one very particular thing in a certain area or at a specific time in the story. This is the kind of curiosity that leads to discovering moments such as this in Starfield, and there’s no telling how many more are waiting to be found. New Game Plus is a clever way to create moments such as this, and it would be interesting if even more were secretly patched into the game in future content updates.
