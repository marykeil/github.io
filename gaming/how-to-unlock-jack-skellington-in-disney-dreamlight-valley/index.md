## Literature Review

The Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington, finally makes his long-awaited debut as a new guest in Disney Dreamlight Valley, but only after some player tasks.





Once players have ensured that their version of Disney Dreamlight Valley is up-to-date, launch the game and the beginning of Jack Skellington&#39;s quest will be active automatically. To begin, explore the valley and look for the sparkles that indicate a discoverable item on the ground.




                  10 New Features Thatâ€™ll Get You Playing Disney Dreamlight Valley Again   Disney Dreamlight Valley announced its roadmap for the coming year in a recent Showcase Event, particularly highlighting changes coming at launch.   


 How To Unlock Jack Skellington 
Something Comes A&#39;Knocking Quest
         

Specifically, there are going to be four different Matryoshka dolls lying around in the valley. Unfortunately, their exact spawn locations are randomized for every player, so there isn&#39;t a specific location to look for them. However, they&#39;re decently sized and will sparkle upon approach, so they shouldn&#39;t be too hard to track down. The dolls can spawn in every biome, except for Forgotten Lands, so be sure to check everywhere. Once even one has been collected, speak with Merlin.

This will initiate the beginning of the Something Comes A&#39;Knocking Quest and Merlin will tell you that the doll appears as if it could hang on something and encourage players to search the Forgotten Lands for what they may go with. There are four dolls in total to find, so it&#39;s recommended to gather them all before heading to the Forgotten Lands, otherwise, you&#39;ll be doing a fair amount of running back and forth for no reason. With all the dolls in hand, head to the Forgotten Lands.






Be sure to have a decent amount of money in Disney Dreamlight Valley at this point, as once Jack Skellington is welcomed, his home will need to be built before he can officially be considered a guest, and though it won&#39;t be as expensive as Belle and The Beast&#39;s castle, it still won&#39;t be cheap by any means.




Once there, look around for an odd tree. This tree will be larger than all the others in this area and have a distinctive appearance that will make it stand out. To ensure the right tree has been found, check the base to see if it has the Pumpkin King logo, which is a Jack-O-Lantern, carved into the bottom. If so, interact with the tree, which will allow you to place each doll one by one, with the pumpkin carving growing more colorful and distinct with each one.

Once all the Matryoshka dolls have been placed, the pumpkin carving will open, mimicking the door in The Nightmare Before Christmas, and the alert welcoming Jack Skellington will appear. After his cutscene and the obligatory welcome photo, speak with Jack, who will provide you with his home to be placed. After it is placed, pay Scrooge his 5000 Coin construction fee and Jack Skellington will have officially joined Disney Dreamlight Valley.
