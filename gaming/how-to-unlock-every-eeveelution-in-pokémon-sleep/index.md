## Literature Review

Eevee is perhaps one of the most sought-after Pokémon in Pokémon Sleep due to its 8 different valuable Eeveelutions, all of which evolve differently.





Eevee has eight different evolutions, which include Jolteon, Flareon, Vaporeon, Leafeon, Espeon, Umbreon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. Similarly to most Pokémon games, each has unique requirements to evolve Eevee into it. Additionally, Eevee candy will also be required, a concept some may be familiar with if they have experience with Pokémon GO.






A special Eevee Event is running in Pokémon Sleep from November 20th, 2023, at 4 a.m. to November 27th, 2023, at 3:59 a.m. local time. During these dates, you will have increased chances of encountering Eevee and every Eeveelution. Additionally, Eevee incense can be earned by completing event missions increasing encounter chances, including for Shiny Eevee in Pokemon Sleep.




                  How To Catch Shiny Pokémon In Pokémon Sleep   Encountering a Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon Sleep is possible with a little bit of patience and Drowsy Power from the main screen&#39;s Snorlax partner.   


 Requirements For Every Eeveelution in Pokémon Sleep 
          

Like all Pokémon in Pokémon Sleep, Eevee has its own Sleep Type, Snoozing. This means those who frequently see snoozing in their sleep report are likelier to spot one. However, this doesn&#39;t guarantee an Eevee will appear either, as they are also more likely to spawn depending on the location and the level of your Snorlax. For example, Eevee spawns on both Greengrass Isle and Cyan Beach, but while Snorlax only needs to be a Basic 1 on Cyan Beach, it needs to be a Basic 4 on Greengrass Isle for better odds at encountering Eevee.




Luckily, Eevee is a relatively common Pokémon in Pokémon Sleep, so players should see it popping up after a few days of steady sleep research. Unfortunately, this is the easy part, as encountering the Eeveelutions is much rarer and requires most players to be consistent in their sleep research, so Snorlax is at one of its maximum levels. This is why it&#39;s recommended to work towards evolving Eevee instead. Since each Eeveelution requires such different conditions, it&#39;s important to narrow down which one you want beforehand, especially since they all help the other Helper Pokémon and camp differently.
