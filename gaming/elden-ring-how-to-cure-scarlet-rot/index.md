## Literature Review

To remove Scarlet Rot in Elden Ring, Tarnished must craft and consume a specific consumable or wield a fiery spell to cleanse their soul of rot.





Thankfully, you can cure Scarlet Rot in Elden Ring by using two methods. The first method is consuming Preserving Boluses; the other involves using an Incantation. You can purchase Preserving Boluses from Nomadic Merchant near the Caelid Highway North. However, the better way involves crafting them by gathering all the ingredients.




                  Why Caelid Is Covered In Elden Ring&#39;s Scarlet Rot   Elden Ring&#39;s Caelid is one of the most challenging and unforgettable regions that ties both into the game&#39;s lore and the origins of the scarlet rot.    


 How To Craft Preserving Boluses In Elden Ring 
          

To craft Preserving Boluses in Elden Ring, you will first need the Armorer&#39;s Cookbook [6]. You can find this cookbook in Elden Ring within the Siofra River region near the Site of Grace at the Siofra River Bank. The book will be in a corpse sitting on a cliff&#39;s edge. You will be able to identify this corpse as there are two ghostly Ancestral Followers nearby next to the corpse.

Once you have acquired the Armorer&#39;s Cookbook [6], you can craft Preserving Boluses using the following ingredients:

  Ingredients   Location    2 Dewkissed Herba    Found all around the Siofra River.    1 Crystal Cave Moss   Found within the Stillwater Cave and Academy Crystal Cave.    1 Sacramental Bud   Found near the Church of the Plague and the Writheblood Ruins.   






The other way you can cure Scarlet Rot is by casting the Flame, Cleanse Me Incantation. This Incantation costs 14Fp and requires 12 Faith. You can find the Flame, Cleanse Me Spell within a Fire Monk Camp southeast of Church of Vows. You can reach this camp by traveling up the Liurnia Highway until arriving at the Eastern Tableland Site of Grace. From here, travel southwest to the campsite to find the Incantation on a corpse beside several breakable pots.

                  Elden Ring: How To Get Every Incantation (&amp; What They Do)   Incantations are Elden Ring&#39;s powerful Faith-based spells, and Tarnished players can learn over 100 of them on their quest to claim the Elden Ring.   

 However, the Fire Monks residing within the area are not friendly in Elden Ring. Therefore, it is recommended that you lure out the hostile enemies to take them out one by one. Once the camp has been cleared, you can enter in and claim Flame, Cleanse Me.
