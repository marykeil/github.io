# Mass Effect 4 Is Setting Itself Up To Fix Andromedas Biggest Issue


## SUMMARY 



  Mass Effect 4 could span two galaxies, making it the largest area seen in the series yet.   The game might address criticisms of Mass Effect: Andromeda by including more alien races and expanding the storyline.   Bioware could make one of the five endings from Mass Effect 3 canon, possibly bringing back Shepard for closure.

## Literature Review

From what we’ve seen in teasers, Mass Effect 4 might fix the issues of Andromeda by combining its story with the original trilogy in a new plot.




Mass Effect 4 remains shrouded in mystery since the developers have released little more than teasers for it. However, those teasers have been enough to uncover some hints as to what could be included in ME4 and where it might take place. Among the information gleaned from teasers is the reconstruction of a Mass Relay that was likely destroyed during the Reaper Invasion of ME3, and a distress signal originating from the Andromeda Galaxy.




A new Mass Effect trailer was released on N7 day, and although it&#39;s only 30 seconds in length, it provides a shocking amount of information for the next game. The next Mass Effect returns to the focus on the Milky Way, and at least one character from the original trilogy will be returning, since Liara has made an appearance in previous teasers and images. But the Milky Way is likely not the only galaxy the mysterious N7 featured in the teaser will be visiting, as the distress signal from Andromeda could indicate that the next game will be intergalactic.

 Mass Effect 4 Could Have The Largest Scope Yet 
          

Since the Mass Relays are being repaired, there&#39;s a person wearing N7 gear, and Liara is present, it&#39;s a safe assumption that the primary setting for Mass Effect 4 is the Milky Way. However, receiving a distress signal from Andromeda could mean that the next game might take place across two galaxies, which would make it the largest area seen in a ME game yet. But that also gives Mass Effect 4 the chance to address criticisms of ME: Andromeda and open up opportunities to return to that galaxy in future games, like a retcon without fully retconning the events of the entire game.

Additionally, taking place over two galaxies opens up more possibilities for a sprawling storyline. But even if the area in which the game is set is the largest yet, that doesn&#39;t mean that the plot has to have the high stakes of previous games, such as the Reaper invasion and the possible end of all intelligent life in a galaxy. It might be better to balance the restoration of the Milky Way, exploring Andromeda, and investigating the distress signal instead of going straight to another devastating event.



 Addressing Andromeda&#39;s Criticisms With Mass Effect 4 
          

While some features of Andromeda were enjoyable in their own right, especially after a few patches helped smooth out performance, there are aspects that could&#39;ve been done better. Where the original trilogy focused on Shepard working to prevent the Reapers from wiping out intelligent life in the Milky Way, Andromeda is about the exploration of an entirely new galaxy in hopes that the races from the Milky Way can find new homes there instead of becoming extinct. And that plotline made it seem odd that only a few new alien races are seen in ME: Andromeda.





 

Aside from possibly including more alien races in ME4 by having it span two galaxies, it might be able to make up for some of the content that never ended up being released for Andromeda. If Mass Relays are being fixed, and it&#39;s possible to receive distress signals from Andromeda, then it&#39;d make sense to build Mass Relays in locations that allow travel between these two galaxies. It allows for expansion into new areas, the inclusion of new alien races, and avoids feeling too cut off from the original trilogy.



 Making A Mass Effect 3 Ending Canon 
          




Beyond addressing the criticisms given to ME: Andromeda, Bioware can acknowledge the biggest criticism that was given to ME3 in the next game: the endings. By returning to the Milky Way, Bioware needs to make one of the five endings to the original trilogy canon. From the teasers, the canon endings could even be the Mass Effect 3 perfect ending where Shepard lives. The Destruction Ending seems to be the only option for canon right now given the teasers, since they show the Mass Relays being repaired.

If the Control or Synthesis endings were going to be canon, then there either wouldn&#39;t be a need to repair the Mass Relays, or Reapers would be seen helping to repair them. Considering the Destruction ending was the only one with two versions, and one of those versions is considered a perfect ending that relies on military strength, it&#39;s already been seen as the unofficial canon ending. This path could also mean that Shepard returns to the series, possibly as the playable character or through mention. Shepard could even just be an NPC or an Easter Egg to give a bit of closure to their fate after fighting the Reapers.






 Fixing The Main Character With Mass Effect 4 
         

Another criticism of ME: Andromeda revolved around the Ryder twins, who were the playable characters. They were designed to be mostly blank slates. While they received the N7 armor to wear, they weren&#39;t official members of N7, and that armor was handed down to them by their father, who was an official N7. On one hand, this can help make the Ryder twins feel more relatable, since they prove themselves through the events of the game. On the other hand, this lack of past achievements and history in the galaxy can make the twins feel underwhelming instead.

Yet returning to Shepard might not be the best path for the main character of ME4. A new game allows Bioware to create a character that allows for more choices and depth by offering various backgrounds that change the dialogue and scenes based on the choices made. A wider array of options for creation can help design a main character that doesn&#39;t have a set background like Shepard, but also isn&#39;t such a blank slate that they end up feeling bland.




Mass Effect 4 is likely a few years away, given how little information has been revealed through teasers and the scarcity of updates regarding the game&#39;s status. However, it seems like Bioware is already taking measures to avoid the criticism that was given to ME: Andromeda and, to a lesser extent, ME3. The chance to return to Andromeda and combine the trilogy with ME:A offers no shortage of exciting directions that can be taken in Mass Effect 4.
