## Literature Review

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s story isn’t over yet; there’s a new adventure coming to the Kitakami region. Here’s everything to know about the update.




There&#39;s more Pokémon Scarlet and Violet left to come, even after The Indigo Disk DLC. The Pokémon franchise&#39;s ninth generation began in 2022 with the release of Scarlet and Violet. It more recently completed a two-DLC run of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk. Together, the two parts comprise an expansion called The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero. The Indigo Disk ends in a final battle against a second set of Elite Four trainers, wrapping up the paired DLCs and seemingly concluding the Gen 9 story for good.




But apparently, that&#39;s not the case. There&#39;s more content planned for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and it&#39;ll be here sooner than expected. Here&#39;s everything there is to know about Scarlet and Violet&#39;s upcoming update, when it&#39;ll be, and what it might look like.

                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Full Pokédex: Every Pokémon Number &amp; Type   Over 200 Pokémon compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all of them, listed in order.   


 Pokémon: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Is Getting An All-New Epilogue 
         

According to the official Pokémon X (formerly Twitter) account, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC will receive an update on January 11, 2024. It&#39;ll be available at 2 PM UTC, which corresponds to 9 AM EST or 6 AM PST. This comes in the form of a brand-new epilogue, which should wrap up the story of the two DLCs and put an end to the Kitakami saga. However, it&#39;ll likely consist of more than a few short story cutscenes. The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&#39;s epilogue promises a whole new adventure, and will probably include some new map areas and trainer battles.





 



 How To Access Pokémon: The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero&#39;s Epilogue 
          

In order to play through The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&#39;s epilogue, a couple of in-game conditions must be satisfied. First, players must have completed the base game of either Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, up to a certain, indeterminate postgame event. They&#39;re also required to have completed the story segments of both DLCs: The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk. Once those conditions are met, the release date has arrived, and the update has been installed, the epilogue should be available to begin.




The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&#39;s epilogue is close at hand, coming out just over three weeks after its initial announcement. It should add a satisfying conclusion to the Kitakami portion of Scarlet and Violet’s story, while also providing a new adventure for longtime players. Unfortunately, this is likely to be the final bit of new content for Gen 9. However, that means a new generation is on the horizon. There’ll probably be more to know after Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s story concludes on January 11, 2024.
