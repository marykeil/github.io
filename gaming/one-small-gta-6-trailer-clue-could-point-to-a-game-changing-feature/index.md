# One Small GTA 6 Trailer Clue Could Point To A Game-Changing Feature


## SUMMARY 



  Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s trailer indicates the integration of social media platforms similar to TikTok could be a major feature within the game&#39;s storyline and mechanics.   The use of social media apps in GTA 6 could potentially unlock new missions and opportunities for players, shifting the &#34;Strangers and Freaks&#34; missions to social media interactions.   Social media could play a larger role in GTA 6 by satirizing true crime media and allowing players to shape their characters&#39; reputation through online videos, potentially influencing the behavior of NPCs in the game.

## Literature Review

Could the social media footage in GTA 6&#39;s first trailer be an indicator that in-game apps could play a larger part in the game&#39;s story and gameplay?




One particular part in the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer could be an indicator of one of the upcoming game&#39;s major features. The trailer introduced players to the game&#39;s main protagonists, Lucia and Jason, and showcased a revamped, modernized version of Vice City and the wider Florida-inspired area of Leonida, with some of its more eccentric citizens on full display through in-game social media videos.




Most of these videos appear to be on a platform similar to TikTok, and while it could just be a creative way to introduce players to the world of Leonida and move Vice City away from the 80s era of previous games, there is also the possibility that Lucia is watching these clips on her phone. The footage shows people partying, performing dangerous stunts with cars, and even wrestling an alligator before setting it loose upon a store. It&#39;s worth noting that if this is supposed to be from the perspective of Lucia&#39;s phone, she isn&#39;t following any of the accounts, implying that she is doomscrolling.

                  GTA 6 Trailer Released Early After Leak, Rockstar Confirms Release Year For Next Massive Game   After years of waiting, Rockstar has finally revealed the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, showing off the game&#39;s location and characters.   


 The GTA Games Have Introduced Social Media In The Past 
Facebook, X, And Instagram Have All Been Parodied
         




Social media had been seen in previous Grand Theft Auto titles. In Grand Theft Auto 4, Niko Bellic couldn&#39;t use the various networking sites, however, and only communicated via his standard email, but the game&#39;s various sites acted more as comedy pieces to reveal information about some of the other characters he could interact with in Liberty City. Grand Theft Auto 5 took this a step further by parodying Facebook and X (then called Twitter) with Life Invader and Bleeter, respectively, with sites that could be accessed on &#34;iFruit&#34; phones. Much like with GTA 4, the main characters in GTA 5 couldn&#39;t post anything on these sites but could see comments from their friends and family on their walls concerning the antics that have recently unfolded in the game&#39;s missions.

There was one app that players could use properly in GTA 5 called Snapmatic. This app parodied Instagram and let characters take photos of anything in Los Santos, or take selfies. These images could be shared with others via Rockstar&#39;s real-world social media platform “Social Club”, and Rockstar held several competitions through this feature over the years. Social Club also included a version of Life Invader where players could like in-game businesses to grant them discounts. These pages also had posts that could be shared on the real Facebook and Twitter apps for further interaction. There was an additional corresponding &#34;iFruit&#34; app for phones that fed into the Social Club platform and let players customize their license plates, play with Chop the Dog, and more.






Unfortunately, the iFruit app was deactivated and Rockstar Support stated that it was no longer supported as of December 12, 2022.




It&#39;s possible that the deactivation of the iFruit app in 2022 could be making way for a new kind of app that better feeds into Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s newer social media platforms and how they function within the game. Making short videos using a hybrid of GTA 5&#39;s Director Mode and a TikTok-esque interface could be a great way to share the outlandish antics that players and the residents of Leonida are getting up to and encourage further interaction with the game outside of GTA 6 core campaign, whereas previously Rockstar depended upon players moving to the live-service GTA Online for ongoing playability once GTA 5&#39;s story ended.

                  What Platforms Will GTA 6 Release On? (Confirmed)   Rockstar Games has confirmed the release date for the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, and what platforms it will be on at launch.   






 Could Social Media Play A Larger Part In GTA 6? 
Could GTA 6&#39;s In-Game Apps Unlock New Missions And Opportunities?
         

The heavy inclusion of social media in Grand Theft Auto 6&#39;s reveal trailer could point to an overhaul of how the mobile system works in the game, with these apps being integrated into its story and key mechanics more than in previous titles. Whereas players could unlock additional small adventures through random encounters and interactions with NPCs in GTA 4 and GTA 5&#39;s open-world maps, it&#39;s possible that Rockstar could shift the GTA series&#39; &#34;Strangers and Freaks&#34; missions to social media, with players spotting &#34;Florida Man&#34;-esque actions in videos or posts and unlocking an icon on the game&#39;s map to go and participate in them.

There is also the potential for Grand Theft Auto 6 to satirize the popularity of true crime media through its inclusion of a TikTok-esque app. If so, this could be a novel way of covering Lucia and Jason&#39;s crime spree in the media, offering an insight into the public&#39;s opinions on the matter outside of the characters&#39; friends and family. If so, it&#39;s possible that Lucia and Jason&#39;s crime spree in Grand Theft Auto 6 could result in some kind of fame and notoriety in the media, with their story taking inspiration from the real-world criminal duo, Bonnie and Clyde, who became some of the most famous robbers of their time due to extensive press coverage.




If so, Grand Theft Auto 6 could use social media as a way to incorporate a version of the Honor mechanic seen in the Red Dead Redemption games. It&#39;s clear Rockstar&#39;s been focused on this kind of system for a while, with it reportedly featured in the canceled Bully 2 where NPCs would remember the actions of the game&#39;s protagonist, Jimmy Hopkins, and behave differently depending on how he personally treated them. Videos plastered on the internet in Grand Theft Auto 6 would be a great way to change public opinion and have different factions or citizens respond accordingly to Lucia and Jason, resulting in the player facing more resistance or support in areas they&#39;ve previously visited depending on their actions.

With a 2025 release date now confirmed for Grand Theft Auto 6, hopefully, Rockstar will begin to share more information surrounding the game&#39;s core mechanics. With how heavily social media seemed to be featured in its first trailer, however, it would be surprising if it hadn&#39;t been more heavily integrated into the game than in previous entries.
