## Literature Review

December 22nd’s Wordle answer can be solved in about four attempts if players use words with multiple vowels in their first few attempts. 





If you always use random words in your first few attempts, it might be time to switch to Wordle’s hard mode. Using random words often leads to players using their daily streaks, and this mode comes in handy to prevent such situations. The harder mode locks in the correct position of confirmed letters, meaning you will be forced to use those letters in the same spot. This will let you think of words that fit the spelling instead of using random words and running out of attempts. However, if you still find it difficult and need to use hints, you can refer to them below.
