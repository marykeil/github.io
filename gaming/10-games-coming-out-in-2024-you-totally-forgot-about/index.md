## Literature Review

There are many highly anticipated games in 2024 that could make people forget about some of these other gems that are also planned for release.




After a year of back-to-back releases of massive video games in 2023 for both consoles and PC, it doesn&#39;t look like game developers are slowing down any in 2024. The already-announced releases that are planned for the coming months have so many incredible-looking games that it is easy to forget about some, even ones that sound pretty impressive in their own right. As the launches of each of these titles draw closer, they will likely pick up a bit more hype, but even now it is fun to look at what is on the horizon and relish the anticipation of what games look appealing.
No matter the genre or platform that players prefer, the upcoming games in 2024 already have something for everyone. Due to how many big releases are expected, some have slowly begun to be overshadowed already. Many of these games have been anticipated for years already, making them somewhat of a background thought for those who are excited about them simply because of how long they have waited. Some of these also do not yet have specific dates for when they will be available other than simply that it will be this year.
