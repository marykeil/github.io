## Literature Review

Thanks to a giant Patch 5, good-aligned Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 players can now recruit Minthara. However, recruiting her involves some very specific steps.





Before Patch 5, good-aligned players had to rely on workarounds to recruit Minthara. It was briefly possible to recruit Halsin and Minthara together, but this was later patched out. Players quickly resorted to using mods, or an extraordinarily technical loophole that involved using Polymorph to transform her into a sheep. You can now officially recruit her on a good run, but the process still has a few odd technicalities that haven’t been fully ironed out.

 How To Recruit Minthara In Baldur’s Gate 3 (Patch 5) 
          

According to Larian’s patch notes, Minthara will reappear at Moonrise Towers in Act 2 if she was knocked out in Act 1.

To knock her out, you’ll have to toggle on your party’s non-lethal attacks before fighting her. This option can be toggled on under the Passives tab on your hotbar. However, community testing has also revealed a few additional requirements that you’ll need to follow:

  Minthara must be Temporarily Hostile rather than permanently hostile. To trigger this state, commit a crime in front of her to start a fight.   Minthara must be knocked out at the Goblin Camp. Betraying her and knocking her out during the Grove Raid won’t work, as she will be permanently hostile.   Dror Ragzlin, another of the Goblin Camp’s leaders, must still be alive and non-hostile when you knock out Minthara. If fought, Ragzlin will alert the whole Goblin Camp, making them permanently hostile.  




Once you’ve knocked Minthara out cold, you can continue as normal and proceed into Act 2. On entering Moonrise Towers for the first time, a cutscene will play where Minthara is judged and imprisoned by Ketheric Thorm. This unlocks Decide Minthara’s Fate, a side quest that allows you to break her out of Moonrise Towers Prison. She can then be spoken to and recruited to the party.

Make sure to rescue Minthara and the tieflings (and potentially Wulbren too) before entering Baldur’s Gate 3’s Gauntlet of Shar. The Gauntlet contains a point of no return, locking you out of certain side quests if not completed and potentially killing any prisoners locked up in Moonrise Towers.



If you’re still having trouble, YouTuber Crimsomrider has a great outline of the recruitment process in their video.

 
 






 Should You Recruit Minthara In Baldur’s Gate 3? 
          




While technically doable, Minthara’s recruitment method for a good run doesn’t seem quite feature-complete. Baldur’s Gate 3’s massive Patch 5 may be only laying a basic foundation for a future update that streamlines Minthara’s recruitment for good characters. In the meantime, evil-aligned characters can still recruit her in the same way as before, and Minthara is worth recruiting if you’re planning a run as an evil character.

However, good characters might also want to consider trying to recruit her. As an evil character, Minthara is rather different from your other party members. As the only Drow companion in the game, she brings a unique perspective that no one else (except a Drow Tav or Dark Urge) has. She’s also classed as a Paladin, making her a useful addition to your Baldur’s Gate 3 party if you don’t already have a Paladin’s might on your side.
