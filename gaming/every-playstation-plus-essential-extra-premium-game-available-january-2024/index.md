## Literature Review

Sony has announced the games that will be available through PlayStation Plus in January 2024. Here&#39;s what subscribers can expect to see.




Sony has announced the lineup of games for PlayStation Plus in January 2024, bringing some new highlights to the steadily updated service. PS Plus is first and foremost a subscription to online PlayStation features, making it possible to access multiplayer servers for plenty of games across Sony systems. The PS Plus game catalog is also a major draw, however, making it easy for subscribers to consistently access new experiences that are offered as a general perk as long as a subscription is active.




Users of Essential, the most basic PlayStation Plus tier, are able to access three new titles every month, which rotate out when the next set is introduced. These don&#39;t necessarily have to be played during the month that they&#39;re available, as adding them to a player&#39;s library will keep them accessible as long as a PS Plus subscription is active. Upgrading to Extra or Premium maintains the rotating titles while also unlocking a more permanent library, which steadily grows with new additions that significantly outpace the occasional removal of certain games.


 Every Game Coming To PlayStation Plus In January 2024 
          

The January 2024 Essential lineup for PlayStation Plus was revealed on the official PlayStation Blog, which is the standard channel for monthly PS Plus reveals. January 2024 will be adding A Plague Tale: Requiem, Evil West, and Nobody Saves the World to the service. A Plague Tale: Requiem will only be playable on the PS5, while Evil West and Nobody Saves the World are available on both PS4 and PS5. A subsequent PlayStation Blog post revealed the games coming to PS&#43; Extra and Premium&#39;s game catalog, as well as the retro games being added to the latter&#39;s classics collection.




 PlayStation Plus Essential  PlayStation Plus Extra  PlayStation Plus Premium    A Plague Tale: Requiem     Evil West     Nobody Saves the World       Tiny TIna&#39;s Wonderlands – Next-Level Edition   Resident Evil 2 (2019)   Hardspace: Shipbreaker   LEGO City Undercover   Just Cause 3   Session: Skate Sim   Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun   Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong   Surviving the Aftermath     Rally Cross   Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace   Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary Collection   Legend of Mana   Secret of Mana   






Tiny Tina&#39;s Wonderlands, a fantasy-skewed Borderlands spin-off, and Resident Evil 2, an impeccable remake of the 1998 classic, are certainly the two triple-A highlights of the revolving catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers, but there are also a number of other games providing variety in all sizes. Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a unique puzzler tasking players with dismantling spaceships in zero gravity, and Session: Skate Sim has emerged as one of the premier and meticulous skateboarding sims. All the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalog additions will become playable on January 16, 2024.



 Unique Adventures For January&#39;s PS Plus Games 
          

2022 Game of the Year contender A Plague Tale: Requiem is the highest-profile addition to the PS Plus Essential library in January 2024, following up on the July 2021 PS Plus inclusion of A Plague Tale: Innocence. Requiem continues the compelling story of siblings Amicia and Hugo that the first game started with another action-adventure stealth experience. Set in France during the Hundred Years&#39; War and the spread of the bubonic plague, A Plague Tale: Requiem pulls no punches in rendering a harsh world and making consistent threats to the act of survival feel all too real. 




                  A Plague Tale: Requiem Review - A Brutal Story Of Love   A Plague Tale: Requiem ups the ante from the original title in emotional and gameplay terms to create gut-punch of a video game.   

Evil West takes a historical setting in a more literally monstrous direction, unleashing hordes of foul creatures in the American Wild West. The story is simple, but it sets up dynamic, third-person shooter action that can be played alone or with a friend. Nobody Saves the World likewise features both solo and co-op play in an action RPG setting, with procedurally generated dungeons that scale alongside Nobody Saves the World forms and abilities to empower players in the adventure. Although A Plague Tale: Requiem might be best played after Innocence, there&#39;s likely to be something for everyone among the three options for PlayStation Plus subscribers in January 2024, especially when considering the multiplayer possibilities.
