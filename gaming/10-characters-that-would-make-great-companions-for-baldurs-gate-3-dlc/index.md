## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has 10 companions to recruit, but that&#39;s a drop from previous installations in the series. So which NPCs deserve a promotion?




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has 10 companions to meet and recruit, which aid in the important mission of saving the Sword Coast from the threat of the Absolute. However, as fantastic as these characters are, there are plenty of others that are met during the story that would also make brilliant companions. More companions for the party would be a perfect addition for a DLC, but which of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s fascinating NPCs would work the best?
[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.]
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 has the fewest number of companions when compared to previous entries in the series, as there were up to 25 companions available in the first Baldur&#39;s Gate, while Baldur&#39;s Gate 2 had 17. While there is no need to reach 25, adding a few more companions in BG3, especially evil or darker ones, would help cover many more playthrough styles. There are also some classes that are underrepresented within the current group of companions that would benefit from having a playable character.
            
 
 &#34;An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas&#34;: Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Review 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is imposing in stature and its best moments are truly memorable, but some early issues with scale suggest an uneven experience.












 








 10  Thulla (Deep Gnome Rogue Or Artificer) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1
        

Thulla is a deep gnome that can be met at the Myconid Colony in the Underdark. When met, she asks the party to help find and free her clan from the Absolute cultists. Thulla is a strong-willed and resourceful character, and completing her quest would be an obvious recruitment point. Having escaped from the duergar, Thulla is clearly cunning and nimble, and would make an excellent rogue or even present the opportunity to bring an artificer into BG3.
            
 
 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: Should You Kill Or Free True Soul Nere? 
Like most choices in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, the decision to save or kill True Soul Nere has different outcomes and rewards depending on how things play out.








 9  Barcus Wroot (Deep Gnome Rogue Or Artificer) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1 Or 2
        

Barcus Wroot is another member of the Ironhand clan that would make a fantastic companion. It would make the most sense to recruit Barcus after meeting him a second time in Grymforge or perhaps after completing his quest in Act 2. Barcus has such a wonderfully odd personality and could provide a lot of laughs with banter or interaction with the other companions. As with Thulla, Barcus would work well as a rogue or artificer, creating explosives and gadgets for the party.





 8  He Who Was (Shadar-kai Fighter Or Ranger) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 2


 







The mysterious He Who Was would be perfect for a darker playthrough and, as a servant of the Raven Queen, would be an interesting counterpoint for many other companions. He Who Was is a shadar-kai who is tracking a murderer in the Shadow-Cursed Lands and is in an easy to miss hidden spot in BG3’s Act 2. He Who Was would work well as a fighter or ranger, as he is clearly someone accustomed to fending for himself in the wilds of Faerûn and beyond.
Shadar-kai were once elves who were transformed after becoming trapped in the Shadowfell. They serve the Raven Queen, who sends them out to collect memories of tragic events, often guided by ravens. 






 7  Abdirak (Human Cleric) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1


 







Abdirak is a priest of Loviatar who can be met inside the Shattered Sanctum in Act 1 of BG3, and can provide an amazing permanent buff. Abirak is such a strange character and would make a great alternative cleric for the party in place of Shadowheart, particularly if the goblins are sided with in Act 1. It would be especially interesting to see the chemistry he would have with other companions, given some of the reactions to his short quest.





 6  Dror Ragzlin (Hobgoblin Barbarian) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1


 







As one of the leaders of the goblin group in Act 1, Dror Ragzlin would make an interesting replacement for Minthara as the &#34;evil&#34; playthrough companion. Minthara is now recruitable without sacrificing the Druid Grove, meaning both she and Halsin can join the party, so having Dror Ragzlin become the new companion tied to the outcome of that particular choice would make a lot of sense. Dror is a barbarian and could also act as a replacement for Karlach, as she will not join the party if the tiefling refugees are killed. It would be interesting to learn more about this gruff hobgoblin before he becomes infected by a mind flayer tadpole, similar to Minthara.





 5  Kagha (Wood Elf Druid) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1
        

Another character whose recruitment could be tied to decisions made in resolving the conflict between the goblins and the druids is Kagha. Depending on choices made by the party, Kagha could join, either seeking redemption or under orders from the new shadow druid leader of the Grove. Kagha would make an interesting alternative to Halsin for an evil playthrough where the Grove was saved.
            
 
 Baldur’s Gate 3 Ending Explained (&amp; What Choices Can Change It) 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 can end in a number of different ways, but the overarching plot will generally remain similar between different endings.








 4  Sazza (Goblin Rogue) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1
        

Having a goblin join the party in Act 1 would give not only an alternative viewpoint on the whole Absolute cult, but also a different view of the world. Goblins are often looked down on in Faerûn, so giving them a voice in BG3 could lead to some very interesting interactions with other companions and NPCs, similarly to what Lae’zel provides currently. Sazza would be the most obvious choice as, if she is freed from the Druids, she has a reason to owe the party and interact with them in a different context to many of the other goblins.





 3  Dame Aylin (Aasimar Paladin) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 2 Or 3
        

Dame Aylin is a character that almost seems as though she was meant to become a full companion, but it wasn’t fully implemented. The party first hears about her in Act 1, and then, at the conclusion of Act 2, frees her from her prison where she becomes one of the many characters that can join the BG3 camp. However, she still has more as her personal quest concludes in Act 3, at which point she will leave the camp until the final battle. This feels like a wasted opportunity, as having a flying paladin of Selûne would be incredibly fun.





 2  Rolan (Tiefling Wizard) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1 Or 2
        

When first met in the Druid Grove, Rolan can come across as harsh, and by the time he is encountered again in Last Light Inn in BG3’s Act 2, he’s downright rude. However, much of this seems to mask the young teifling wizard’s own insecurities. Being able to recruit Rolan as the party convinces him and his siblings to stay with the other tieflings would lead to a deeper connection to the quest “Rescue the Tieflings” in Act 2, and an alternative way to meet or ally with Lorroakan, should anything happen to Aylin.





 1  Alfira (Tiefling Bard) 
Could Be Recruited In Act 1
        

Given how much fun bards are to play, it&#39;s practically a crime that there isn&#39;t a recruitable bard companion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Turning Alfira into a companion would fix that and allow the party to get to know the bright and sweet tiefling better. Obviously, there would be complications for those playing as the Dark Urge, but as many have already found a workaround to keep the loveable bard alive through Act 1, having her join the party shouldn&#39;t be too much trouble. Bard is a fantastic support class, and having a notice adventurer like Alfira along for the story could provide many much needed lighter moments in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
