## Literature Review

The Sunday Wordle is available to solve and today&#39;s answer shouldn&#39;t be too much trouble for most fans of the game.





There are plenty of ways to increase the challenge in the daily word-guessing game and one of the easiest ways is to try Wordle&#39;s Hard Mode. This mode forces players to utilize the hints given from each subsequent guess and locks in letters when they are shown to be correct. This helps curb players wasting guesses on an answer that is sure to be incorrect, but certainly requires a brit more brain power to figure out the answer.




                  The Psychology of Wordle: Why Knowing It&#39;s &#34;Hard&#34; Makes It Easier   Thanks to Wordle&#39;s score-sharing, players can observe how difficult other Wordle players found the daily word, making guessing it themselves easier.

Before we fully spoil today&#39;s Wordle answer below, we wanted to provide a few hints for those who still want to get the word themselves, but need just a little push in the right direction.

 Hint 1  There are no repeating letters.   Hint 2  The answer is a noun, an adjective, and an adverb.   Hint 3  The vowel is in the 2nd position.   Hint 4  The direction in which a compass needle normally points.

The January 21st Wordle answer is NORTH.

Not too difficult of a challenge for us today as we started our guesses with IRATE. This locked in the &#39;T&#39; and gave us a misplaced &#39;R&#39;. Moving forward we tried switching things around a bit and used PORTS as our second guess. This locked in the whole middle section of the word and led us quickly to our Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer, NORTH.
