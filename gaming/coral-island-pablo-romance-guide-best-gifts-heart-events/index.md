## Literature Review

Pablo is one of two dateable blacksmiths in Coral Island. He&#39;s a charming, flirty, and helpful fellow with an odd love for all things pickled.





As you get to know Pablo, you will better understand why he bounces around town, helping people when he can. His Heart Events are closely tied to Rafael and showcase the two brothers&#39; unique relationship. Once you get him to 5 Hearts, he can send you Gold Bars in the mail. Even if you don&#39;t want to marry Pablo, you should at least befriend him.

 Pablo&#39;s Daily Schedule

 Best Gifts For Romancing Pablo 
          

There are a lot of items that Pablo loves, or at least tolerates, in Coral Island, but few are as wonderful in his eyes as pickled goods. Pickled carrots, pickled ginseng, pickled garlic, if it can be pickled, Pablo will love it. To make pickled products, you will need to build a mason jar on your farm with 30 Wood and 12 Glass. Mason jars are available at Level 3 Farming.

You can give Pablo two gifts every week, except for his birthday on Spring 27. If you give Pablo two weekly gifts before his birthday, you can still give him a birthday gift. Your farm will probably need to be more significant to give Pablo one of his most loved gifts for his birthday in Year One.

 All Heart Events For Pablo 
          

The more gifts you give Pablo, the more Hearts he will have. Hearts represent your relationship with a character. You can get up to eight Hearts from every character, with a maximum of ten Hearts for characters you choose to date. Each Heart Event unlocks the day after you reach the needed Hearts. You must experience each Heart Event to get through Pablo&#39;s full story. Once you finish his 8 Heart Events, you can give him a locket purchased at the blacksmith shop. You will now be dating him and can get up to 10 Hearts. You propose to him after his 10 Heart Event.
