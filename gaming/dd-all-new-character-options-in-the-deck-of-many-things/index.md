## Literature Review

D&amp;D’s new Deck of Many Things and Book of Many Things bundle adds a number of new character customization options to the game. Here’s what’s included.




The Dungeons &amp; Dragons expansion bundle including The Book of Many Things and The Deck of Many Things contains many new options for player character customization. As per usual, this new release for the Fifth Edition of DnD expands on the ways in which the game can be played. It brings a wide variety of new rules, concepts, and magic items to the table, in this case, all themed around cards, luck, and games of chance.




The Deck of Many Things primarily serves as a new method to inject some more random chance into a game of DnD. The cards within can do any number of things, from summoning friendly creatures who help the player to stealing their very soul. However, the newly minted tie-in sourcebook, The Book of Many Things, exists in part to give players a little more control over how they play their cards. To that end, it outlines a series of brand-new backgrounds, feats, and spells to be added to their character sheets. Here are all the new customization choices in the Deck and Book of Many Things.

                  &#34;Embracing Chaos&#34; - D&amp;D: The Deck Of Many Things &amp; Book Of Many Things Review   The Deck Of Many Things bundle for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e includes a nice new sourcebook and numerous goodies, but comes with some caveats.    


 New Character Backgrounds In The Book Of Many Things 
         




There are two new character backgrounds in The Book of Many Things: the diametrically opposed Ruined and Rewarded. These refer to characters who have undergone a major twist of fate, either positive or negative, giving them a chance to change (or maintain) their fortune.

Ruined gives characters proficiency in Stealth and Survival, in addition to the Still Standing character feature, which can ensure their continued survival in tricky situations. Rewarded instead grants proficiency in Insight and Persuasion, with the Fortune&#39;s Favor feature for a little extra luck. These backgrounds are naturally designed to round out characters with a penchant for gambling, whether with their money or their lives. The two opposing feats can accommodate either characters who are down on their luck, or those who&#39;ve just hit the jackpot.



Neither of the new backgrounds are prerequisites for the new feat in The Book of Many Things, but players who choose to take one of them may still take any feat of their choice.









 New Feat In The Book Of Many Things 
Cartomancer is a card-focused feat for spellcasters
          

Cartomancer is the sole new feat in The Book of Many Things, and as its name implies, it allows for characters to cast spells with a magical deck of cards, or imbue those cards with magic. This plays on the classic archetype of the card trick-performing magician, and suits high-rolling, high-Charisma, high-risk characters well.

First and foremost, in order to take this, a player character must have one of two class features: Spellcasting or Pact Magic. Spellcasting refers to any character&#39;s innate arcane abilities, which means it applies to almost every magically-inclined class in the game: bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. Pact Magic applies in cases of spells that stem from pacts with Otherworldly Patrons - in essence, this only applies to Warlocks.




Characters who take the Cartomancer feat are able to use a deck of cards, although not necessarily the Deck of Many Things itself, as an Arcane Focus. They can perform some basic sleight-of-hand tricks using the spell prestidigitation, which isn&#39;t limited to the Cartomancer - this is actually a simple transmutation cantrip learnable by bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. Cartomancer simply expands the purview of prestidigitation&#39;s usually sensory effects to apply to basic card tricks as well.


 

But perhaps most usefully, Cartomancers can also imbue a singular card with magic, then hide it up their sleeve, only to draw it later and cast their chosen spell as a bonus action. Naturally, this feature requires a fair bit of planning ahead, but it can give the party a pretty major advantage, and make spellcasters even more overpowered than they usually are. Players may use it to keep an extra attack up their sleeve, or to cast a traversal, buff, or debuff spell at a moment of desperation. It has as many applications as there are spells in DnD, and can only get better with player creativity.






 New Spells And Magic Items In The Book Of Many Things 
          

The Book of Many Things also includes three new spells: spray of cards, spirit of death, and antagonize. Spray of cards works much like color spray. It can be an excellent way to cause some chaos in any number of situations, combat or otherwise.

Spirit of death allows the caster to summon an avatar of death that&#39;ll haunt an enemy of their choice. This has a similar effect to one of the cards in the Deck of Many Things: the Skull card, which does just the same. An avatar of death will attack just one target, as if haunting them, so players have limited control over it. However, other characters aren&#39;t able to attack it without suffering severe consequences, possibly even summoning death avatars of their own.

                  Tony DiTerlizzi on Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse, Yoshitaka Amano, Star Wars &amp; More   Screen Rant discusses D&amp;D&#39;s Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and the setting&#39;s beginnings with veteran illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi.    




The final spell, antagonize, is kind of like the inverse of charm person. It allows the caster to create artificial conflict between two people, in much the same way that charm person allows them to force someone else to become their friend. This can be used in combat to turn enemy groups against each other, in social situations to cause infighting among rivals, or even when the party needs to create a quick distraction so they can sneak past.

All of these character options can also be used in conjunction with the wide variety of chaotic magic items in DnD&#39;s The Book of Many Things. One particular highlight is the Warrior&#39;s Passkey, a sword that can also serve as a key or a magic weapon. Players can also draw a variety of cards from the included deck to obtain even more magic items, like the magic ring granted by the aptly named Ring card.

Those are all the player character options available in The Book of Many Things. While there&#39;s not quite enough to build an entire character from scratch in there, there&#39;s more than enough to flesh out an existing one, or inspire a new card-themed concept for an upcoming campaign. In tandem with The Deck of Many Things, the new sourcebook can be used to create a lively, chaotic campaign in which chance plays a major role, and a single unlucky hand can spell death and disaster for the entire party. Either way, having more character options in Dungeons &amp; Dragons is never a bad thing.
