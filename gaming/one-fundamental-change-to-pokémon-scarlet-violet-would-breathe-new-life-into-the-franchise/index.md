# One Fundamental Change To Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Would Breathe New Life Into The Franchise


## SUMMARY 



  Pokémon Scarlet and Violet offer an open-world adventure with roaming wild Pokémon, improving gameplay.   The dialogue options in Scarlet and Violet have little impact on the main story, limiting player choices.   Allowing in-game choices to lead to divergent experiences would bring new life to the Pokémon franchise.

## Literature Review

Changing one aspect of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet could lead to the entire Pokémon series becoming far more engaging for individual players.




Building upon Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s structure with one big change would herald a new era for the Pokémon franchise. Every new Generation has built upon its predecessors with both mechanical improvements and brand-new features, and Gen 9’s Scarlet and Violet are no different. However, even disregarding the newest Pokémon games’ infamous glitches, they arguably fall short of their full potential in some respects.




Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have made large strides in improving gameplay with new features. They offer an open-world adventure with visibly roaming wild Pokémon, which is in itself a far cry from the capabilities of Pokémon Red and Blue. However, despite this, the games arguably still could have done more to differentiate themselves from prior titles; for example, despite the open-world design, there is no level-scaling applied to the base game&#39;s Gym Leaders and other notable NPCs. This means that there is still a ‘correct’ way to progress, moving from Scarlet and Violet’s easiest Gym Leader to the hardest.

                  Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#39;s Open World Has A Big Leveling Problem   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s open world created a leveling problem with story objectives that were scaled too close together, removing any challenge.   


 Pokémon Scarlet And Violet’s Dialogue Choices Could Prompt A Radical Change For The Franchise 
          




Throughout Scarlet and Violet, there are a multitude of dialogue options that appear during conversations. However, for the most part, these have no bearing on the main story of the game; NPCs may react differently or provide slightly different information, but this will not cascade into any larger differences. On occasion, the options even simply (and somewhat pointlessly) offer different ways of saying the same thing. Arguably, beyond the choice of starter, the player cannot make any significant decisions at all. Just as there is still a best order for Gyms and Team Star Bases, the overall plot remains linear.



Despite the Gyms and Team Star presenting a steadily scaling challenge in a specific order, following said order necessitates traveling back and forth across Paldea instead of moving in a simple circuit.




Very few choices of responses to NPCs have any meaningful influence on the direction of a conversation, let alone later interactions. There are rare exceptions; Gym Leaders invited to Blueberry Academy can refer to Rika’s League interview if named the player’s favorite, but even this is still relatively minor. As a result, the dialogue options arguably only offer the illusion of choice, despite the clear potential for different selections to have actual impact. Changing this would mean that the player character and their bonds with NPCs could be far more individualized, ultimately forming a unique experience.





 

Allowing in-game choices to lead to divergent experiences could easily be the next big step for the Pokémon franchise. It would allow for an even greater degree of personal freedom in someone’s own personal journey through a region, compounding the shift to open-world adventures. This could improve upon Scarlet and Violet’s already excellent approach to storytelling by allowing for different endings to the game, such as alternate final scenes with rival characters depending on the relationship developed with them beforehand. Other activities, like catching minor Legendary Pokémon, could also have a more notable impact on later events.



 Branching Narratives Hold Immense Potential For Pokémon 
          




Scarlet and Violet’s more involved conversations and plot lines have opened the door to divergent narratives, but at this point, it seems unlikely that the games will capitalize on this. Unless additional DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is released as a follow-up to The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, extending the story even beyond the Mochi Mayhem epilogue, there is no longer any space for such choices and their consequences to exist. Because of this, the next core Pokémon games are perhaps the most likely to learn from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and take this step.

Of course, being a fairly linear RPG series, Pokémon has always limited a player’s options in terms of progression. Even as technology has advanced to allow more complex games to be created, this is a basic element of design that has so far held true. However, moving towards open-world design has slowly changed the games to allow more personal freedom, and this trend seems likely to continue, possibly even for the narrative. For example, additional DLC could introduce new conflicts between the player characters&#39; group of friends, with choices determining how these conflicts are resolved and the story’s ultimate outcome.




Meanwhile, Gen 10 Pokémon games could easily have divergent stories built into them from the outset, which would make them the most flexible titles in the franchise. Of course, it is worth noting that there will likely be some points of commonality throughout all endings, such as facing the main antagonist of the game. As such, any differences seem most likely to focus on key NPCs. Although, with that being said, it is also possible that a villain’s plans could be affected according to how somebody progresses through the game, perhaps even to the point of altering their ultimate strength.



 A Pokémon Game’s Plot Cannot Diverge Too Widely 
         

On the other hand, while it is possible for a Pokémon game with branching narratives to feature several entirely different endings, this does seem unlikely. After completing the main story, there are many reasons to not reset the game in search of an alternate ending. For example, many people would not wish to give up their current team or lose access to postgame content. And while Pokémon Home is compatible with Scarlet and Violet, the fact that a paid subscription is needed to unlock its full features means that some could be dissuaded from using it to preserve their Pokémon.




Dialogue choices and other actions that can tangibly affect the story of a Pokémon game would radically widen the scope of what is possible for the franchise. Of course, any such divergent paths will likely reach similar conclusions, but the experience of the path taken to such an ending is arguably far more important. The freedom that diverging narratives would bring to Pokémon — on top of the open-world and other design aspects of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet — would undoubtedly give the classic franchise new life.
