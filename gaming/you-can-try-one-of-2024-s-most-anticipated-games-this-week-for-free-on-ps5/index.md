 Tekken 8 Demo Characters, Maps, And Game Modes 
Iconic Characters Return
          

Though limited, people will gain access to memorable returning Tekken characters in the Tekken 8 Demo in the form of Jin, Paul, Nina, and Kazuya. Sadly, there is no access to any of the new characters that may be potentially coming to the game, though they may be featured elsewhere in the demo. The demo will also feature three different maps in the form of Urban Square, Yakushima, and Sanctum.

The Tekken 8 demo will provide a variety of game modes, including:

  Story: &#34;The Dark Awakens&#34; Chapter 1   Arcade Quest Chapter 1   Super Ghost Battle   Unlocks after clearing Arcade Quest   Versus    Gallery   

Super Ghost Battle is a game mode that unlocks after completing Arcade Quest Chapter 1. It is important to note that during the demo period, online play is disabled, and save data won&#39;t be retained in the full version of the game when it is released.




                  Katsuhiro Harada &amp; Michael Murray On How &#34;We&#39;re Seeing A Lot Of Surprises&#34; For Tekken 8   Two of the developers behind the upcoming Tekken 8 share their thoughts on the game&#39;s new mechanics, Arcade Mode, and what will surprise players.   



 What To Expect From Tekken 8 
New Game Modes, 32 Characters
          

Though the demo is just a slice of what players can expect when the game releases, it&#39;ll give everyone a first impression of what to expect in the upcoming game. Arcade Quest serves as a new game mode that acts as the title&#39;s interactive lobby, akin to what Street Fighter 6 did earlier this year with its Battle Hub Mode. The Arcade Quest game mode puts the emphasis on a novice arcade fighting game player new to the scene in a meta twist.

With 32 total characters in the Tekken 8 roster, the inclusion of multiple game modes, including Tekken Ball, and improved AI that learns the player&#39;s patterns, Tekken 8 is shaping up to be one of the better fighting game releases in some time. The full game releases on January 26, 2024, with pre-orders for Tekken 8 currently open.
