## Literature Review

Removing a Villager in LEGO Fortnite is fairly easy, but players should first consider other options to unlock more settlement space for new friends.





Before you send any of your Villagers away, you may want to upgrade your LEGO Fortnite Village instead. You unlock slots for more Villagers as you upgrade, and a fully upgraded Village can house five Villagers. As such, it may be worth checking whether any of your settlements have room before deciding to remove someone. However, if you’ve hit the limit, then removal may be your only option.





 How To Remove A Villager In LEGO Fortnite 
          

To remove a Villager, destroy their bed, and then speak to them. They will explain that they’re planning to leave and will give you five in-game days to build them another Bed. At this point, you can craft a new Bed for them if you change your mind, and the Villager will stay and continue to work their assigned jobs. However, if you do nothing, they will leave your Village for good.

Unfortunately, even if you’re really keen to get rid of a Villager, there don’t seem to be any options for doing this quickly. There are no dialogue options for asking a Villager to leave, so you’ll have to wait out the five in-game days to free up space. However, once they’re out, you can recruit a new LEGO Fortnite Villager to replace them.



Beds only cost ten Wood or six Planks to build, so you don’t need to worry about finding rare resources to build more.







Ideally, you should avoid recruiting Villagers you don’t like in the first place, and work on upgrading your Village. At Village Level 5, you’ll start to spot rarer Villagers passing through the area. By recruiting later in the game, you can save yourself the potential headache of having to pick and remove one of your companions.



 Should You Remove Villagers In LEGO Fortnite? 
          

In gameplay terms, Villagers are flexible and can work in any job you assign them. There aren’t any Villagers with special skills or proficiencies that you should prioritize; for example, you won’t find that certain Villagers are better at collecting some Fertilizer for crops compared to others. When it comes to functions, they’re essentially identical and there isn’t a real reason to send them away.




However, appearances might matter a lot to you, as many of LEGO Fortnite’s Villagers are based on characters from Fortnite’s incredibly storied lore and past seasons. Learning how to remove a LEGO Fortnite Villager gives you room to welcome your favorite characters if and when they decide to visit you.
