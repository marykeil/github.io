## Literature Review

Diablo 4â€™s first expansion will not only continue the main campaign story but could bring back a boss with a long history in the Diablo franchise.




Diablo 4 recently announced an upcoming expansion to the dungeon crawling game which will be titled Vessel of Hatred and is expected to make its debut late in 2024. The announcement came with a trailer during the BlizzCon 2023 event, but not much information was provided just yet as to the story that will be seen in the campaign of the new DLC other than that it picks up where the crucial narrative left off at the end of the base game. The story so far has been left on a cliffhanger, which this expansion is poised to address.




[Warning: The Following Article Contains Spoilers About The Main Story Of Diablo 4 and Diablo 2.]During the BlizzCon 2023 live Diablo 4 campfire chat, many of the development team for the game discussed some of the information that they were able to share regarding Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred. The story will take players into the jungles of Kurast and introduce an all-new playable class to the game that has never been seen in the Diablo universe thus far. Kurast was a key location in Diablo 2, and heavily featured one particular Prime Evil that has appeared in much of the lore of Diablo: Mephisto.

                  Every Major Change In Diablo 4 Season 2 from D4 Season 1   Season 2 of Diablo 4 brings more than just the Season of Blood, there are also numerous quality-of-life improvements happening for the entire game.   


 Vessel Of Hatred Will Likely Focus On The Prime Evil Mephisto 
Diablo 4&#39;s First Expansion
          




It has been confirmed that the expansion Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred will take the story to the area of Kurast, which is a familiar area to veteran players who experienced it in Diablo 2. The area of Kurast was known to be a beautiful paradise before it fell to Mephisto&#39;s corruption. The jungle that surrounds the ancient city was itself, created by Mephisto&#39;s power as he controlled the church, city, and land surrounding it all. This is a land that Mephisto is quite at home in, and likely considers his personal playground within Sanctuary.


 

In Diablo 2, it was here in Kurast that Mephisto was supposedly defeated by the heroes of that game. After a long hunt and intense battle, Mephisto&#39;s essence was imprisoned inside a soulstone. That soulstone was later destroyed with the objective of putting an end once and for all to Mephisto&#39;s machinations upon the world.

Always Followed By The Bloody Wolf
          

It should come as no surprise to those who finished the main campaign of Diablo 4 thus far that the story is not complete. The ending scenes and epilogue provide more questions than answers in its cliffhanger. Mephisto&#39;s essence is once again trapped inside a soulstone and the young girl, Neyrelle, takes off on a journey to defeat the Lord of Hatred by herself. Lorath pursues her, knowing that Mephisto&#39;s corruption will be working on the child, and the final imagery players are left with is that of Neyrelle being shadowed by the bloody wolf form of Mephisto.

Where Neyrelle is going, and what her intended goals are, is left unknown. There are many theories of what she could be planning to do, but it is evident from the epilogue that she thinks she can put an end to Mephisto once and for all, and that it will claim her life in the process. Perhaps a repeat of the ending of Diablo 1 is coming, although Neyrelle&#39;s studies with her mother will hopefully lead her to be smart enough to not try to put the soulstone in her own forehead.




                  Diablo 4 Ending Explained (In Detail): Diablo 4&#39;s Story So Far   The story of Diablo 4 is revealed through a Prologue, four Acts, and an Ending, but that ending may in fact not be what players are expecting.   



 Mephisto Has A Long History In The Diablo Franchise 
He&#39;s Not Merely A Wolf
         

Mephisto, The Lord of Hatred, is seen frequently throughout Diablo 4 in disguise as a bloody wolf, presenting himself as an ally to the Wanderer. In reality, he is one of the three Prime Evils alongside his brothers, Diablo and Baal. His presence in the series has always been a main antagonist, as he continues his war against the High Heavens in the Eternal Conflict and everything that stands in his path to gain dominion over the Burning Hells. In Diablo 4, Neyrelle recognized the runes on the wolf&#39;s head as being Mephisto and was the only one who recognized his secret identity, and she took it upon herself to contain him.

Mephisto is more intelligent and sneaky than his brothers among the Prime Evils, leading many astray through his cunning machinations and ability to turn people against each other. He is the father to Diablo 4&#39;s Lilith and grandfather to Rathma, and he has appeared in every game, web series, and book related to the franchise except Diablo 1.



 Datamined Information On Diablo 4 Vessel Of Hatred Offers Clues 
Leaked Files
          

Theories and suppositions point to Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred being focused heavily on Mephisto&#39;s role and the self-proclaimed quest of Neyrelle. The trailer includes the voice of Mephisto, who gives a dark promise of overpowering the child. Taking clues a step further, there have also been some datamined leaks shared on Reddit and other places that have supposed files from Blizzard listing Mephisto as a key part of Vessel of Hatred.




                  Diablo 4 Devs Tease Pets Are Coming In A Future Update   One of the favorite features for many fans of Diablo 3 was collecting non-combat pets in the Seasonal content. Hopefully, Diablo 4 will add them soon.   

Blizzard is famous for its ability to weave stories, and the Diablo franchise is known for offering surprises to its audience. The fate of Neyrelle and Mephisto himself will likely have many more curveballs that the Wanderer will need to offer assistance with. Until Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred is revealed in full, much of this is left to supposition and theory. It is nearly certain, however, that the Lord of Hatred will play a large role in the narrative to come.
