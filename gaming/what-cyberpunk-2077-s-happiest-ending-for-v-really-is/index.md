## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s varied story endings are bittersweet at best. There may be no &#34;happily ever after&#34; in Night City, but which ending is V&#39;s happiest?





[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077.]




Early in the game, Dexter DeShawn asks the player whether they&#39;d rather &#34;live in peace&#34; or go down in a &#34;blaze of glory.&#34; When it comes to happy endings, those are the only options. One must decide whether V wants the quiet life, sinking into serene obscurity, or go out as a legend. Thus, the happiest endings are either &#34;The Star,&#34; where V gets a peaceful existence knowing they will die, or Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s secret ending, &#34;The Sun,&#34; where V becomes the living legend they always wanted to be. There is also a third ending, Phantom Liberty DLC&#39;s, &#34;The Tower&#34;, where V can be cured of the Relic at a steep cost.

                  &#34;Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists&#34; - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review   Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty&#39;s unpredictable spy-thriller story is full of jaw-dropping moments, and it&#39;s got the gameplay to match.   


 Thinning Out The Bad Choices 
Several Are Just Depressing
         




The easy aspect of narrowing down V&#39;s happiest ending is that most endings are disqualified off the bat. The suicide ending, known as the &#34;Path of Least Resistance&#34; is particularly morose, and about the most on-the-nose &#34;bad ending&#34; a video game can have. A good rule of thumb: any ending that could be straight out of Silent Hill is probably best avoided. &#34;The Devil&#34; ending is a similarly sinister end to the Cyberpunk 2077 story and has V side with Arasaka, a villainous megacorporation, to remove their biochip. Either V gets trapped in cyberspace with no assurance they&#39;ll return, or they go back to Earth abandoned by their friends. The &#34;Temperance&#34; ending - yet another outcome that sees V die in Cyberpunk - doesn&#39;t make the cut either.

                  Who Cyberpunk 2077’s Best Ripperdoc Is (&amp; Where To Find Them)   Wasting time hopping from clinic to clinic isn&#39;t necessary in Cyberpunk 2077, as the game’s 2.0 update fundamentally changed cyberware inventories.   






 Cyberpunk&#39;s Best Ending 1: The Star 
As Happily Ever After As V Can Get
          

 &#34;The Star&#34; is the most traditionally good ending in Cyberpunk 2077, and could even be considered something of a &#34;happily ever after&#34; tale, especially if the player takes Panam&#39;s romance route. In this ending, V leaves Night City with Panam and her clan of nomads after discovering their life has an expiration date. Panam reveals she has a friend who could help save V from their fate, so V rides off into the sunset having joined one of Cyberpunk&#39;s less violent factions.


 

This ending allows V a peaceful existence, hope for a longer life, and a romance with Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Panam, so for any player who believes V just wants to settle down, &#34;The Star&#34; is undoubtedly V&#39;s happiest ending. 




                  Cyberpunk 2077: Should You Romance Judy Or Panam   Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Judy and Panam are rivals for best romance. There are many qualities that recommend them both, but which is ultimately the best?   



 Cyberpunk&#39;s Best Ending 2: The Tower 
Only Accessible With The Phantom Liberty DLC
         

During the Phantom Liberty expansion content for Cyberpunk 2077, if players can spare Songbird&#39;s life and hand her over to Reed, there is an option for a new ending to the overall game that will save V&#39;s life, but at a cost. Reed will contact V after the DLC is over and, when the player is ready for the ending to occur, V will be able to have surgery to cure them of their terminal disease. They wake up and find that two years have passed. All their cyberware is gone, but they are alive. 

What makes this supposedly happy ending so gut-wrenching is the fact that Johnny is lost in the process, with his final goodbye left echoing in the air. That, combined with realizing that everyone else had assumed V was dead and moved on, is a very sad concept. V no longer has Johnny, or anyone else. They are alone and powerless.




                  Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC Endings Explained (In Detail)   Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty DLC has several possible endings to its story, and can even affect the ending for the main game in one situation.   



 Cyberpunk&#39;s Best Ending 3: The Sun 
A Heroic Farewell
          

Perhaps it would be better for V to burn out than fade to black. Being a legend in Night City requires sacrifice, and that&#39;s what &#34;The Sun&#34; ending entails. V takes over the Afterlife and becomes a legend in Night City. V ends up alone, but the whole city knows their name, and in the end, they set off on one final mission: a heist of the Crystal Palace Casino, on behalf of a client who claims they can save V&#39;s life.

This ending is best experienced if it follows the secret &#34;Don&#39;t Fear The Reaper&#34; ending, where V and Johnny raid Arasaka without their allies. Going in alone is extremely risky, but it means nobody dies during the final mission. The V who commits to a life of violence is selfish; they forsake their relationships to attempt a suicide mission, and embrace the resulting fame rather than leave Night City behind. If, however, a player&#39;s version of V wants nothing more than fame and fortune, this is V&#39;s happiest ending. 





 

V finishes their job like a true renegade, spares their friends from danger, and becomes Night City royalty. They may have lost their romantic interest, but they have Night City in the palm of their hand, a way to escape their fate, and the world&#39;s most epic job ahead of them, truly embracing the gritty and glamorous spirit of Cyberpunk 2077.

The world that Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in is far from cheerful, which is visible throughout every interaction in the game. The darkness that hangs over Night City and the hopeless, bleak feeling in the world does not lead to many happy endings. For V, whether it is better to live their final days in peace, be cured but alone, or go out as a hero are all possibilities that have an element of sadness. Cyberpunk 2077 has many different paths that players can take, with philosophical consequences that can be considered with each.
