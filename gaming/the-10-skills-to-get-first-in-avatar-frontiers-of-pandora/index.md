## Literature Review

The Skills you can get first in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora will shape the strengths and weaknesses for your character for the challenges ahead.





There are four Skill Trees that you unlock early, with a fifth only being revealed fairly late in the game&#39;s main story. The Survivor, Warrior, Hunter, and Maker paths all have descriptions that explain how their abilities relate to your Na&#39;vi character. For beginners to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, there are thankfully many ways to study how the nodes on each Skill Tree connect, and how many Points they cost.

 10  Tactical Awareness (Warrior) 
Mark Your Targets
        

The Tactical Awareness skill is found in the Warrior Tree, and encourages you to use your Na&#39;vi Senses to mark enemies in a red outline for extra damage. An additional 15% damage to targets can be incredibly useful, especially against RDA mechs. As you progress toward the end of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, the increased number of enemies makes this skill very useful for taking on larger groups.
Most Skills in any Tree&#39;s path cost between 1-4 Skill Points to unlock. Toward the beginning of the game, almost every skill costs 1, but you can&#39;t obtain some abilities without investing into others earlier in the Tree. 






 9  Shadow Hunter (Hunter) 
Silent as the Night
        

The very first node in the Hunter Skill Tree is Shadow Hunter, an ability that makes your character harder to detect while crouching. You also have increased speed, allowing you to glide through the dense forests or sweeping grasslands of Pandora without getting spotted.
This can be great for RDA Outposts in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, or if you are trying not to be seen by a dangerous target during a hunt.





 8  Connoisseur I (Maker) 
Nothing Has Tasted Better
        

This time for the Maker Tree, another starting node is Connoisseur I, which boosts your character&#39;s use of cooked food items in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. When you&#39;re at a Cooking Station, you can add two different ingredients from harvested materials in the world to create food. Toward the start of the game, you have to experiment with various plant and animal parts to unlock recipes.
These recipes create food items that give your character specific buffs in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. According to YouTube creator AndyReloads, the type of effect and length of time the buff is active can fluctuate depending on which materials you use. This Skill lets any food item you create have a 25% increased buff duration, giving you more chances to rely on certain recipes your character discovers.







 7  Vitality I (Survivor) 
Endure the Cruelty of Nature


 







Going back to the Survivor Skill Tree, the Vitality I ability is incredibly straightforward, boosting your character&#39;s Health by 30. After the first few tutorial missions, you may want to simply explore the open world and attack as many RDA Outposts as possible. This skill gives you a better opportunity to do this without having to worry about your character dying from only a couple attacks in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
Viality I is also a starting node for the Survivor Skill Tree, which has many useful abilities to unlock. As one of the cheapest buffs to get for only 1 Skill Point, you could get this right after you discover the first Tarysu Sapling. 






 6  Extra Ammo I (Warrior) 
Keep the Fight Going
        

One obstacle you&#39;ll have to deal with at the start of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is your ammunition limit, which can be expanded through the Extra Ammo I skill. From the Warrior Tree, this ability lets you carry more arrows, spears, and firearm rounds during your journey. This prevents you from having to craft ammo in the middle of a battle, which can be an unfortunate interruption that could cost your life.

 5  Strength IV (Warrior) 
Master of Combat
        

While later skills from the Warrior Tree can be expensive, the Strength IV buff is worth the 3 Point cost. While it does increase your Base Damage by 10%, it also unlocks paths toward major damage buffs for specific weapons in the next areas of the Tree.
By getting this ability early, you can choose a combat Expert trait that reflects your mastery of a certain weapon, making you a deadly fighter in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.





 4  Stable Hands (Maker) 
Harvest to Your Heart&#39;s Content
        

The Stable Hands skill makes gathering easier to perform, allowing you to collect more items in pristine condition. Many plants that you interact with have pre-determined settings based on the environment in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. For example, harvesting a plant&#39;s resources whose materials are best collected at night gives you a better item for different crafting recipes.
Some plants have harvesting mini-games that require your character to use a delicate touch to extract large parts. This sensitive process is made far easier through the application of this skill&#39;s buff. 






 3  Lethal Stalker (Hunter) 
Go in for the Kill
        

Stealth is an integral part of combat in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, with the Lethal Stalker skill from the Hunter Skill Tree bolstering this philosophy. Within 10 seconds of killing an unaware target, you get a 25% increased damage buff through this skill. This is perfect for attacking RDA Outposts, since basic human guards are easily taken down in one hit to set up this effect on your next target.





 2  Sturdy Arrows (Maker) 
Recycle Your Weapons


 







A truly unique skill of the Maker Tree is Sturdy Arrows, which prevents hunting arrows from breaking on impact in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. This means that you can pick up your used arrows without having to craft more, saving tons of room in your inventory for other resources. Just walk over to where your character shot an arrow to recover it for whatever task awaits.
Depending on what skills you have for your character, you can only have a limited amount of ammo at all times. Recovered arrows from this skill are still limited by this aspect of your character. 






 1  Vigor I (Survivor) 
Endurance is the Key to Survival
        

An often overlooked aspect of your character in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is their Energy, a resource that lets you automatically heal if full. This blue meter depletes from any basic activity, from sprinting to firing arrows. During the early stages of the game, it can be extremely hard to keep your Energy full, even if you constantly use food resources to keep it at good levels.
The Vigor I skill from the Survivor Tree gives you 50% additional Energy from your base meter, essentially giving you a massive buff to this resource. With this ability active, you don&#39;t need to worry about it running out in awkward moments during a hunt or assault on an RDA Outpost. This skill is one of the best to get first in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora due to it only costing 1 Skill Point.
