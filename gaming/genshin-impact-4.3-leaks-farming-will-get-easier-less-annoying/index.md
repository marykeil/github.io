## Literature Review

It seems like farming Artifacts and materials in Genshin Impact will get a bit easier starting with Version 4.3, according to a new set of leaks.




According to a set of new Genshin Impact 4.3 leaks, farming will get a little bit easier and slightly less annoying in the game. Farming items and pieces of gear in HoYoverse’s popular action-based RPG is a long-lasting issue, with Original Resin limitations, daily locks, and randomized drops that make obtaining certain things much harder than they should. Even with some slight changes and implementation of new mechanics, Genshin Impact still has an Artifact grind problem, for instance, which fills players’ inventories with items plagued by stats that do not serve much of a purpose other than being utilized as EXP for an eventual good Artifact.




While bad Artifacts in Genshin Impact tend to be in the spotlight, mostly due to the randomness of the stats that come in drops, farming is a wide-ranging issue in the game. Obtaining items and resources is very time-consuming, as players need to actively rush through Domains multiple times to get what they need. Considering that the game does not have an auto-battle system for farming, like in Honkai: Star Rail – another of HoYoverse’s most popular titles – the investment to level up characters and weapons goes beyond the items themselves, but extends to the player’s time, too. That may change soon, however, if leaks are to be considered.

                  Genshin Impact 4.3 Leaks: Phase 2 Banners Suddenly Make A Lot More Sense   New Phase 2 banner leaks for Genshin Impact 4.3 may debunk previous leaks. The information is sustained by another set of leaks regarding Chevreuse.   


 Rechallenging Domains In Genshin Impact Will Undergo A Small Change 
         




According to a new leak regarding Version 4.3 that was shared by a Redditor and later reported by Game Rant, HoYoverse may be planning to implement a long-needed quality-of-life update to Domains. As exemplified in the Reddit post, which is tagged as a reliable piece of information by the leaker known as Kuroo, the Domains in Genshin Impact will get a new feature that teleports players back to the key that initiates the activity once they try to rechallenge it. This means that, instead of returning to the beginning of the area, those who want to replay the Domain will be conveniently placed next to the button that initiates combat.



Even if the leak is classified as reliable, with video footage serving as alleged evidence of proof, it should be taken with a grain of salt. Genshin Impact leaks may be inaccurate or subject to change ahead of the release of the respective Version.






 Leaked Update Can Optimize Farming Time In Genshin Impact 
          




While it seems like a very small system optimization feature, bringing players back to where they can immediately initiate the activity instead of the far end of the Domain itself can improve farming time in Genshin Impact. Surely, only a few seconds of navigation are wasted by moving from the back of the room toward the center of the arena, but this stacks up in a significant manner. Seeing that Domains are made to be challenged multiple times, often sequentially, these few saved seconds can build up to a few minutes as the number of challenges issued by players increases.

If players are frustratingly struggling to obtain Artifact pieces with the best stats in Genshin Impact, for instance, sparing them from running 10 seconds before they start every Domain challenge is a big improvement. This is also true for Ascension materials and Talent books obtained through Domains – though these items do not suffer from the randomized stats that Artifacts do, they often need to be farmed in large bulks. Players trying to max out their characters, weapons, or their characters’ abilities will soon realize that running the Domains from which the items drop only a few times is very unlikely to suffice.




The new quality-of-life improvement featured in the Version 4.3 leak gains extra value when running Domains in coop mode in Genshin Impact. Often, multiplayer guests are slower when loading into the Domain due to connection issues, so they take longer to reach the central arena where combat is held. If players are thrown straight into the area when rechallenging the Domain, the waiting time for the multiplayer guest to load and then run to the arena is cut in half, as they will automatically be placed where they need to be – this is beneficial to both the belated player and the other challengers who are waiting.



 Leaked Content Does Not Address Major Issues Around Farming In Genshin Impact 
          

There is no doubt that the new Domain function featured in the Genshin Impact 4.3 leaks is good. However, the upgrade that is being added is not a solution, but a simple counter-measure. The problem with it is that it does not address the larger issues that surround farming. Farming in Genshin Impact can be gruesome. While especially true for Artifacts due to their randomized stats, even materials can be tough to gather. The game imposes a 160 Daily Original Resin limit for players to use, substantially cutting their gains from Domains. Even if they use Fragile Resin to regain 60 Resin, this item is hard to come by.






Daily resources for running activities are commonplace for several F2P (free-to-play) live-service games, but it is restricting.




In addition to that, items have specified days they appear in Domains, meaning players may actually have to wait for a certain weekday to arrive before they can start farming the items they need. When combining these two factors, it can take a long time for players to gather what they need to fully level a character or a weapon. This is worsened by the fact that, as was previously mentioned, Genshin Impact does not have an auto-battle function, which would allow players to mindlessly gather important resources while being able to partake in other real-life activities – to farm in the game, players need to be paying attention.

It may be hard to implement an auto-battle feature in the title due to its live action-based gameplay style – unlike Honkai: Star Rail’s turn-based combat, for instance – but it adds to the grief that accompanies the process of farming for now. The leaked feature that teleports players back to where they need to be is expected to arrive in December with Version 4.3. Even if it arrives late, it is a step in the right direction. There is, however, still a long path ahead before making farming in Genshin Impact a lot better.
