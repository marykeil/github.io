## Literature Review

The iconic Gold, Silver, &amp; Crystal starter Pokémon Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile return for you to find and catch in the Indigo Disk DLC.





The character Clavell will invite you on a trip to the Blueberry Academy to start off The Indigo Disk DLC. Going through the story of this content will eventually unlock the League Club - a place where you can earn Battle Points (BP) to spend on quests in the Terarium. These missions are directly tied to making every starter Pokémon from each Generation available in the wild areas of various biomes.






You must have purchased The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero expansion to the base game to reach Part 2 of the DLC, also known as The Indigo Disk. Anyone can access this Part after beating the main story of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet and the first section of added content.




                  One New Pokémon Indigo Disk Location Fixes The Series&#39; Biggest Problem   It seems like there will be a major change in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which may even push the franchise forward.   


 How To Find &amp; Catch Cyndaquil 
          

Cyndaquil, The Fire-type Pokémon starter from Gold, Silver, &amp; Crystal, is found in the Polar Biome after you spend 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; in that region. One of the computer terminals in the Terarium has a list of quests in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet that you can invest BP in. Once you have earned enough points from the League Club, go to the Support Board and scroll down to find various missions.




The Terarium Club will have a biodiversity quest tied to the Polar Biome that you should &#34;purchase&#34; by getting rid of BP. This will cause new Pokémon species of many shapes and sizes to appear in that quadrant of The Indigo Disk map. Cyndaquil is one of those rare pocket monsters added to catch and train in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.



 How To Find &amp; Catch Chikorita 
          

You can find and catch the Grass-type Gen 2 starter Chikorita by spending 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Coastal Biome. This functions in the same way as Cyndaquil but for a completely different section on the combined map of the DLC. Those who spend the BP can immediately head to Chikorita&#39;s associated Biome to capture the adorable creature in Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.




                  Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Full Pokédex: Every Pokémon Number &amp; Type   Over 200 Pokémon compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all of them, listed in order.   



 How To Find &amp; Catch Totodile 
          

The final Water-type starter, Totodile, is unlocked to find and catch once you spend 3,000 BP to &#34;boost the biodiversity&#34; of the Savannah Biome. 12,000 BP may seem like a lot for only three Pokémon, but at least five other starters will now appear in each of the three areas you invested in. Search around bodies of water to spot a Totodile you can encounter for another nostalgic Gen 2 starter on your team.

Once you catch every Gen 2 starter in The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, you should be able to find a ton of other creatures from other eras of the series in Biomes you supported with BP.
