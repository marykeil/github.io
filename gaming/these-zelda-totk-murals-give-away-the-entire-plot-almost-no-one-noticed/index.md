## Literature Review

The ancient murals seen in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom reveal most of the plot, although it can be hard to interpret them at first.




The series of ancient murals uncovered in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom actually reveal much of the main story long before Link otherwise learns the truth of what is happening. However, this is only truly noticeable in retrospect, with all the context needed to understand the murals. Nevertheless, through careful examination of the scenes illustrated under Hyrule Castle, it is possible to immediately deduce much of Tears of the Kingdom’s plot.




[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.]

Tears of the Kingdom begins with Link and Zelda exploring a series of caverns below Hyrule Castle, with the Princess becoming ecstatic at the discovery of a set of murals depicting Zonai and the events of the legendary Imprisoning War. These same murals were heavily featured in the first full trailer for TOTK, making them among the first parts of the game that people ever saw. They provide a large degree of foreshadowing for the major events of the past that come to light during the course of the game, to the point of rendering some Dragon Tear memories almost superfluous.



TOTK’s Imprisoning War is the second conflict to be named such in the Zelda franchise, with the first being part of the backstory to A Link to the Past.




                  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Building Excellence   Tears of the Kingdom takes Legend of Zelda into mostly familiar ground, but it remains an excellent, must-play title with plenty of innovation.   





 TOTK’s Basic Plot Is Revealed Through Ancient Illustrations 
          

There are a total of seven murals found below Hyrule Castle, although the final three are initially obscured. Nevertheless, between the images which are immediately visible and Zelda’s own analysis, it is still easy to form a picture of the events of the Zonai era. First, a Zonai descends from the sky to Hylians below, surrounded by seven objects. In the next mural, the Hylians celebrate as this Zonai holds hands with one of their own, two of the same objects floating above the couple. This is, of course, a depiction of TOTK’s Zonai King Rauru descending from the sky with the Secret Stones and going on to marry Sonia.

The revelation from Zelda that this depicts the founding of Hyrule seems somewhat incongruous with what is known of the Zelda timeline, and Skyward Sword in particular, but can at least be accepted as canonical to TOTK’s version of Hyrule. Regardless, the next mural then takes a dark turn by revealing Sonia’s fate - killed for her Secret Stone as Gloom begins to rise around the Demon King. Although not named at this point, it is immediately clear that the imposing figure shown here is indeed Ganondorf. Zelda herself identifies that the Stone must be &#34;something of incredible power,&#34; indicating that this was a great victory for Ganondorf.




The last of the murals to be revealed at this stage then depicts the Imprisoning War in full swing, with Ganondorf’s army of monsters visibly having the upper hand. Of course, given that Hyrule still exists in the present day and the war’s name, it is obvious that the tide eventually turned and that the Demon King was somehow imprisoned. The subsequent encounter with Ganondorf as Rauru’s seal finally fails proves this to be the case, implying that the ancient King sacrificed himself to defeat Ganondorf. Moreover, Rauru and Ganondorf’s Secret Stones, the former of which Zelda then obtains, are clearly the same powerful objects seen in the murals.

                  Link Fighting Ganondorf In Zelda: TOTK Isn’t Even A Fair Fight   As difficult an opponent as Ganondorf is in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, he is arguably not given a fair fight in the game.   



 People Don’t Need The Tears Of The Dragon To Understand TOTK 
          




In just four images, the player is shown almost all the relevant details needed to understand the story of how Ganondorf came to be sealed below Hyrule Castle, ignoring the Sages. The Zonai helped to found Hyrule, bringing their Secret Stones, before the first Queen of Hyrule was murdered for her own Stone and the Demon King Ganondorf then waged war on the Kingdom. When Link ventures into the Depths to confront Ganondorf, or even earlier, if people are simply curious to view the hidden murals and willing to brave the powerful monsters, then these images can easily fill in any gaps in their understanding of the plot.

Of course, this comes with the caveat that people are able to understand and interpret the story being told. Although Zelda does provide some useful context at the beginning of the game, it can be hard to understand, for example, the full tragedy of Sonia’s murder without seeing the relevant memory. Despite being excellent exposition in their own way, these murals are only illustrations. Without textual or verbal accompaniment, they only tell the bare bones of the story, and even then this is best recognized in retrospect. Naturally, it is also possible for people to find explanations of the murals online, but again, this subverts the experience of regular play.






 Zelda’s Fate Is Made Clear In Hidden Murals 
         

The remaining murals directly relate to Zelda’s own presence in the past and would spoil too much for the beginning of the game, explaining why they are initially hidden behind breakable rocks (not to mention the potential for paradoxes). First, the seven Sages of the past confront Ganondorf, Zelda visibly among them. Then, she receives the broken Master Sword at the airborne Temple of Time. This latter scene is seen in full as part of any playthrough, even if Link avoids seeking out the Tears of the Dragon, and so it is not necessarily needed for any form of exposition. However, it does provide crucial context to the final mural.

Even if Link never looks for the Light Dragon’s tears, the last mural reveals what ultimately happened to Zelda after she reached the past. The Light Dragon is shown flying into the sky, the Master Sword clearly embedded in her forehead as she leaves behind the remaining Sages (the human Zelda and both Zonai conspicuously absent). Given the glimpses seen of Zelda in her ancient garb no matter what route people take through the game, it is made clear that Zelda has become the Light Dragon. Ganondorf eating a Secret Stone to become a dragon himself even reveals how, again without the need to see any of the relevant memories.




No matter how much of TOTK people skip, they must pass through the mural chamber in order to reach Ganondorf and finish the game. Because of this, everybody has a chance to uncover the basic plot of the game without the need to travel across Hyrule and uncover all the Dragon Tear memories. Of course, it is worth keeping in mind that these murals lack many details, so even then, it can be hard to fully understand without the full context provided by Zelda’s memories. Nevertheless, the murals found in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are still an intriguing perspective on the game&#39;s plot.

               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017.

Additionally, he will discover the secrets of the dark ones that dwell below and above the earth. The sequel is being built on the same engine as the original, with unique physics tools again being utilized. However, little about the plot and gameplay is known.
