## Literature Review

In Grand Theft Auto V, players can set out to purchase businesses such as the Los Santos Golf Club to make a passive income for them.





Making money in Grand Theft Auto V can be a challenge, but there are numerous ways to do so. One of the ways to do this is to acquire a business that can make money in the background while the player does other things. Certain businesses can only be owned by one or two of the three main characters, while for others it does not matter. While they are usually an upfront investment, the weekly income from them can usually recover the cost.




                  GTA 5 Next-Gen Review: Here We Go Again   Grand Theft Auto 5&#39;s next-gen port mostly looks great, but after nine years of GTA 5 and GTA Online, Los Santos has started to lose its luster.   


 Buying the Los Santos Golf Club Business in Grand Theft Auto V 
         

At one level, it is quite easy to purchase any of the businesses in the game, including the Golf Club. The mission Nervous Ron, which is fairly early on in the game, must be completed before purchasing the club, but otherwise, there are no prerequisites. The Los Santos Golf Club is located in the neighborhood of Richman at the GWC and Golfing Society. It is on Dorset Drive in North Los Santos, and it has a higher upfront cost than any other in the game. This can make it intimidating for players seeking to gain that business.




To purchase the Los Santos Golf Club business, as long as you have the required funds, you can walk up to the property as any of the three main protagonists in Grand Theft Auto V, Michael, Franklin, or Trevor. Interact with the “On Sale” sign near the property. After that, the Los Santos Golf Club business is yours to keep, and you will receive the weekly stipend and free rounds of golf whenever you want.



While it is the highest weekly stipend to match the highest price point, the Los Santos Golf Club will also take 568 weeks to break even on the investment.




While the investment may seem high, a few well-done stock market assassinations for Lester in Grand Theft Auto V might well land you well over the price point if you have not spent anything else. YouTuber Old Grumpy Gamers shows you how to make $6.4 billion on the stock market alone, without any other forms of income.


 




The basic concept is to use assassination missions to manipulate the stock market, saving every time you buy or sell, sending a character to sleep to pass in-game time. After advancing time, check the stock market for the best return, go to sleep, and do it again. Pick the save slot where you had the highest return, sell the stock, and make a lot of money.

You want to wait until the end of the main campaign to have the money to make the most of the stock market assassinations, although you don&#39;t want to finish the main campaign until after the Hotel Assassination. Each character, assuming you have waited to spend money on anything else, should have a decent-looking bank account, with Michael having a total of about $2,000,000. Once that is done, you will want to invest all of your money before continuing with the rest of the assassination missions, making hard saves often along the way to ensure you get the best prices.

You should be well able to purchase any properties you want after completing the missions and selling for the highest price. While you aren’t likely to break even on the Los Santos Golf Club anytime soon, it is a good flex to say you’ve purchased the most expensive business property in the game. Even the previous characters who were upset with you will comment on how they didn&#39;t know you were so rich. This can make it worth it to purchase the Los Santos Golf Club in Grand Theft Auto V, as you show off your unnecessary wealth to all of your friends and can golf in any clothes you want too.
