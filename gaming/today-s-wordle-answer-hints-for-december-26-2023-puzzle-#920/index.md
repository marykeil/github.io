## Literature Review

December 26th’s Wordle answer can be solved fairly quickly if players use their regular starting words and refer to some relevant hints. 





Even though today’s answer is easier than previous Wordles, it might be time to try your hand at a different mode. Wordle’s hard mode is not exactly difficult as it uses some of the same rules as the regular mode. However, in this mode, you will not be able to reuse confirmed letters in other spots, preventing you from using random words. However, if you are running out of attempts and need a bit of help, you can use the hints below.
