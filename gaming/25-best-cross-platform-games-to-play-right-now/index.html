There are lots of different cross-platform games available for all types of players, regardless of their experience with gaming.
Here are 20 of the best cross-platform games for any age and skill level, across a wide range of genres.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Cross-platform games allow players to not only connect with friends on other platforms but also play anywhere, transferring their saves on the go.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing what to play on, cross-platform games are some of the best choices as they don&rsquo;t restrict everyone to the same platform. There are several cross-platform games, like Genshin Impact and Final Fantasy 14, that allow players to try out titles with friends on different console families and even continue their gameplay on an entirely different device. Cross-platform is a broader term for games that have cross-play or cross-save functionality. While cross-play allows them to play with or against players on other platforms, cross-save allows them to share their profiles and saves across several platforms.
Tower of Fantasy has crossplay and cross-save between PC and mobile, for instance. However, the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game do not communicate with the larger player base. There are games that have been cross-platform for nearly a decade now. Nevertheless, the larger discussion around the feature happened between 2017 and 2019. Other titles adapted and gained cross-platform functionalities over the course of time, after their initial release.
How we choose entries for our Best-Of Lists.
For this List, Screen Rant has considered the critic scores of Metacritic, reviews on Steam, and our own reviews. Senior writer Bruno Yonezawa has applied his decades-long involvement with online games, as well as his years of experience as a gaming journalist, to evaluate the picks. We have also taken into consideration what makes something the “Best” of its kind, along with the expectations of the community and how well they are met by players, as well as the entertainment factor of the media being evaluated.</p>
<p>25  Pokémon UNITE
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Mobile</p>
<p>Pokémon Unite</p>
<p>Franchise    Pokemon     Platform(s)    Android , iOS , Nintendo Switch     Released    July 21, 2021     Developer(s)    TiMi Studio Group     Publisher(s)    The Pokemon Company , Nintendo     Genre(s)    Free-to-Play , MOBA     ESRB    E10+</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   2/5    Metacritic   70 <br>
Pokémon UNITE is a solid case of a live-service game that has grown significantly better than it was at launch. While it was successful when it first released, the title lacked a lot of content. Even though it retains its competitive MOBA playstyle at its core, it does offer several events and even PvE activities for players to partake in. There is always something new to do in Pokémon UNITE.
This also includes testing out new Pokémon and their abilities on the field. The player’s account can also be carried over from Nintendo Switch to mobile and vice-versa, allowing them to play on either of those platforms without losing progress or having to set up two accounts. Pokémon UNITE also features cross-play between these platforms, which allows players to connect regardless of their platform of choice.</p>
<p>24  Sea Of Thieves
Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p>
<p>Sea of Thieves</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Windows , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    March 20, 2018     Developer(s)    Rare     Publisher(s)    Microsoft Studios     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure     ESRB    T</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   2.5/5    Metacritic   69    Steam   Very Positive <br>
Sea of Thieves was released as something of an unfinished product, which explains a lot of its low review scores. Nevertheless, the pirate game by Rare for Xbox is continuously expanding with huge updates that increase the amount of things that can be explored, both on land and in high waters.
Even though the title is only available for Xbox platforms, including PC, this title has both cross-play and cross-progression. Essentially, players on Xbox can join their pirate friends on PC and vice-versa, while also being able to carry their progress in Sea of Thieves to another platform should they so desire.</p>
<p>23  Paladins
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Paladins</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , PC     Released    May 8, 2018     Developer(s)    Evil Mojo Games     Publisher(s)    Hi-Rez Studios     Genre(s)    Multiplayer , FPS     ESRB    T</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   74    Steam   Very Positive <br>
The F2P online shooter Paladins is yet another great example of a title with cross-platform capabilities. The game by Hi-Rez is available on several platforms, all of which can interact with each other via crossplay. Players can also transfer their saves via a Hi-Rez account, which enables them to play anywhere.
The game was once a direct competitor to Overwatch, but slowly developed its own spirit. Paladins continues to get better, with every new hero, map, and mode addition. With the wide roster of playable characters, the strategic possibilities are immense.</p>
<p>22  Overwatch 2
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Overwatch 2</p>
<p>Franchise    Overwatch     Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PC , Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    October 4, 2022     Genre(s)    First-Person Shooter     Developer(s)    Blizzard Entertainment</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3/5    Metacritic   79    Steam   Overwhelmingly Negative <br>
Overwatch 2 had a tough launch which contributed to its Overwhelmingly Negative Steam reviews, but it is a steady and reliable F2P (free-to-play) competitive title to play on various platforms. The game is mainly focused on PvP (player versus player), but it has cross-play and cross-save, allowing players on different platforms to connect, as well as continue playing on different devices.
Because of its technical differences, Overwatch 2 tends to pool console players together, keeping PC players separately. Nevertheless, it is still possible to merge the gaming pools, making its cross-play very functional. The competitive scene of Blizzard’s popular shooter needs some work, as evidenced by player reviews, but the game itself is a solid choice for fun times.</p>
<p>21  Back 4 Blood
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p>
<p>Back 4 Blood</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , PC , Xbox Series X , Xbox One     Released    October 12, 2021     Developer(s)    Turtle Rock Studios     Publisher(s)    Warner Bros. Games     Genre(s)    Action , Shooter , Multiplayer , FPS</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3.5/5    Metacritic   77    Steam   Mixed <br>
The closest thing to a Left 4 Dead experience nowadays is Back 4 Blood, and the shooter by Turtle Rock Studios is great at that – a large portion of the credit is also due to its cross-platform features. Back 4 Blood allows players from Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC to all join in together for a shared gameplay experience.
The only cross-platform disadvantage that Back 4 Blood has is that its cross-progression is not fully fledged. Xbox players can only transfer their saves to other Microsoft platforms, and the same is true for PlayStation. Nevertheless, the cross-play functionality works like a breeze.</p>
<p>20  Outriders
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p>
<p>Outriders</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Stadia , PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X     Released    April 1, 2021     Developer(s)    People Can Fly     Publisher(s)    Square Enix     Genre(s)    RPG , Shooter     Multiplayer    Online Multiplayer     Engine    Unreal Engine 4     ESRB    M</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3.5/5    Metacritic   73    Steam   Mixed <br>
Outriders has been a cross-play game since launch and, in fact, it was one of the title’s major selling points ahead of its release back in 2021. The third-person shooter was not as great as advertised but still provided a solid gameplay experience, especially when playing in coop with various classes. Though the game can be experienced in a single-player mode, having friends join in the chaos is half of the experience.
Being able to strategize with friends, each with different sets of skills and weapons, to face tough opponents makes for a fun time. Luckily, there are no platform restrictions when it comes to activating multiplayer, as Outriders is fully cross-play. Another important detail about the game is that it has cross-progression enabled, too, which means that players can carry over their progress in the campaign to another platform if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>19  Dead By Daylight
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Dead by Daylight</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , PC , PlayStation 5 , Nintendo Switch , Xbox Series X , Xbox One , Stadia     Released    June 14, 2016     Genre(s)    Multiplayer , Action , Survival Horror , Horror     Developer(s)    Behaviour Interactive</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   64    Steam   Very Positive <br>
Dead by Daylight is one of the most popular asymmetric survival horror games of the past decade, and one of its strongest points is cross-platform functionalities. As this title is focused on the shared 4v1 multiplayer experience, having a cross-play feature allows the player base to be integrated and expanded.
Cross-play also allows friends to play together, regardless of the platform they have available. If one has a gaming PC and another relies on a console, they can still have fun while trying to survive the killer. The game is constantly growing. For instance, Dead by Daylight added Nicolas Cage as a playable survivor character in an update.</p>
<p>18  Minecraft Dungeons
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Minecraft Dungeons</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC     Developer(s)    Mojang     Publisher(s)    Mojang     Genre(s)    Action , Adventure     Franchise    Minecraft     Released    May 26, 2020     ESRB    e7+     How Long To Beat    5hours</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   2.5/5    Metacritic   70    Steam   Very Positive <br>
A fascinating dungeon crawler set in the world of Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons delivers a fast and fluid gameplay experience set in maps that are procedurally generated. While it may not please players not accustomed to a locked isometric perspective and those who were looking for a longer story and more gameplay depth, Minecraft Dungeons does have a lot of replay value when considering the various weapons players can obtain, as well as how different map layouts can be when revisiting them in a second run of the campaign.
This game can be enjoyed solo, but it is a lot more fun when playing in co-op. A positive aspect is that this title now has cross-play features enabled, allowing players to connect with friends on different platforms. Moreover, Minecraft Dungeons also has cloud saves, which is equivalent to cross-progression and allows players to carry over their progress to other platforms.</p>
<p>17  Temtem
Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Temtem</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Microsoft Windows , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S     Released    September 6, 2022     Developer(s)    Crema     Publisher(s)    Humble Bundle     Genre(s)    RPG , MMORPG , Adventure     ESRB    E10+     How Long To Beat    46h 53m</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   73    Steam   Very Positive <br>
Temtem is a fantastic Pokémon-like alternative to Nintendo’s classic franchise. The game developed by Crema was set to early access for a long time, until its final release. The time in early access allowed the game to be carefully refined, which is what granted it good scores when it arrived.
The title is, essentially, an MMO, which means players will bump into several players, being able to trade creatures and battle. Luckily, Temtem eliminates any type of multiplayer barriers through its cross-platform features, which enable crossplay across consoles and PCs, as well as cross-save, allowing players to pick up their campaign on another platform.</p>
<p>16  Dauntless
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Dauntless</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3/5    Metacritic   78 <br>
While it is arguable that it is not as refined as the Monster Hunter series by Capcom, Epic’s Dauntless is a great F2P alternative for players who want to engage in a coop experience while hunting down gargantuan monsters. This game is both cross-save and cross-play.
Essentially, this means that they can pick up their progress from any platform on which the title is available, so long as their accounts are linked, and they can play with friends regardless of the platform. Dauntless is a great choice for fast-paced and action-heavy combat missions, and being able to play with cross-platform functionalities is a major boon.</p>
<p>15  Overcooked! All You Can Eat
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Overcooked! All You Can Eat</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , PC , Nintendo Switch     Released    November 20, 2020     Developer(s)    Ghost Town Games     Publisher(s)    Ghost Town Games     ESRB    e10+     How Long To Beat    10h 6m</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   84    Steam   Mostly Positive <br>
A fun party game to play with friends, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is the epitome of the franchise. The cooking simulation game is well-known for its ability to test friendships and how players coordinate strategies with one another under the pressure of time.
Overcooked! All You Can Eat was extremely well received by players and critics alike and, luckily, it has a crossplay option that allows for multiplayer action regardless of the platform. The game also has a cross-save feature, allowing players to carry over their progress in case they want to play on another platform.</p>
<p>14  Rocket League
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Rocket League</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox Series X , PC , Nintendo Switch     Released    July 7, 2015     Developer(s)    Psyonix     Publisher(s)    Psyonix     Genre(s)    Sports</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   85 <br>
Rocket League is one of the most creative sport-based games in recent history. With a blend of arcade soccer games and car racing, the now F2P game owned by Epic Games offers a very different experience than most other multiplayer titles in the market. Rocket League is a fun game that can be played on repeat.
A good aspect of it is that Rocket League is fully cross-platform, offering both cross-play and cross-progression. As such, players can team up with friends regardless of their platforms, and also pick up from whatever platform they prefer. This type of experience is great for a game that has quick matches and can be played on home consoles, PCs, and even a hybrid-portable console like Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>13  Warframe
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Warframe</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PC , Nintendo Switch , Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox Series X     Released    March 25, 2013     Developer(s)    Digital Extremes     Publisher(s)    Digital Extremes     Genre(s)    Free-to-Play , Action , RPG , Multiplayer , Shooter</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   64    Steam   Very Positive <br>
One of the best space shooters and action games currently available is also F2P. Digital Extremes’ Warframe is a staple in gaming, especially when it comes to fast-paced combat and various customization options. It also comes accompanied by a great cross-play functionality, which was introduced in 2022.
Though the game is still lacking cross-save and cross-progression, which would allow players to pick up their game and accounts from whatever platform they desire, the current state of Warframe is satisfying enough to make up for that flaw. Although the game was released lacking a lot of content, there is now a lot to do across the universe offered by Digital Extremes, and hundreds of hours can be put into it.</p>
<p>12  Fall Guys
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Fall Guys</p>
<p>Platform(s)    Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S     Released    August 4, 2020     Developer(s)    Mediatonic     Genre(s)    Action , Platformer , Party Game</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   81 <br>
Fall Guys is another great party game to have gained popularity during the pandemic and, while it launched as a premium product, it later became completely free-to-play and had cross-save and cross-play added. This means that players can transfer all their progress across platforms at their will, provided the account is linked.
They can also play the chaotic rounds of Fall Guys with friends on various platforms, with no barrier blocking out certain platform pools. The fact that the game went completely cross-platform merged its player pools, also making matchmaking much more effective and quicker.</p>
<p>11  Genshin Impact
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, Mobile</p>
<p>Genshin Impact</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , iOS , PC , Android , PlayStation 5     Released    September 28, 2020     Developer(s)    HoYoverse (Formerly miHoYo)     Genre(s)    Action , RPG , Open-World</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   81 <br>
Although not entirely focused on the multiplayer experience, Genshin Impact is a great game that happens to feature cross-platform functionalities. The popular action by HoYoverse allows both cross-play and cross-save. Players can add friends with the in-game ID system and then visit each other, regardless of their platform of choice.
Additionally, its cross-save, which needs to be set up through an official HoYoverse account, opens the possibility of playing on PC or PlayStation consoles for a high-end experience and then transitioning to mobile for simpler and quicker tasks, like the daily commissions in Genshin Impact.</p>
<p>10  Among Us
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mobile</p>
<p>Among Us</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PC , Mobile , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S , PlayStation 5 , PlayStation 4     Released    June 15, 2018     Developer(s)    InnerSloth     Genre(s)    Social Deduction , party</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Metacritic   85    Steam   Very Positive <br>
Among Us has been around for a while and had an explosion in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which multiplayer party games gained traction to fill in social gaps. The title’s popularity allowed it to grow, and gain more content and gameplay options. The best part about it is that it is a cross-play game, allowing players from PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile to play together.
The only requirement is to share a code with the intended party so that all members can be lobbied together for the adventure. Among Us is a very casual party game, but the possibility of playing with anyone, even if they do not have a fully dedicated gaming console or high-end PC, easily establishes it as one of the best cross-platform titles.</p>
<p>9  Destiny 2
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p>
<p>Destiny 2</p>
<p>Franchise    Destiny     Platform(s)    PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S , Microsoft Windows     Released    September 8, 2017     Developer(s)    Bungie     Genre(s)     Sci-Fi , Action</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   3.5/5    Metacritic   85    Steam   Very Positive <br>
Destiny 2 is one of the best space shooters available on the market right now, and it has become a cross-platform title after its release. The game developed by Bungie occasionally struggles with the content it presents throughout the years, but its gameplay mechanics make up for it.
Another positive point is that it is both cross-play and cross-save, meaning that players can play with friends on whatever platform they use, and play across several different devices as long as the account is adequately connected. With the arrival of new generation consoles, this was a great move to make in Destiny 2, as players could change their platform and still keep their same account.</p>
<p>8  Borderlands 3
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
<p>Borderlands 3</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PC , Xbox One , PlayStation 4     Developer(s)    Gearbox Software     Publisher(s)    2K Games     Genre(s)    Action , RPG , Shooter     Franchise    Borderlands     Released    September 13, 2019     ESRB    M     How Long To Beat    23 Hours</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   4/5    Metacritic   81    Steam   Very Positive <br>
Highly evaluated for its overall game design and structure, Borderlands 3 is a mighty addition to Gearbox’ popular shooter-looter franchise. It offers a fluid gameplay experience with a lot of variety when it comes to skills, approaches, and, most importantly, weapons to wield. One of the hidden details that adds even more to its gameplay value is the fact that this is a fully operational cross-play game.
This means that players can connect with friends regardless of the platform they are using. Considering how important co-op is for the general experience, even if not mandatory, the fact that multiplayer pools are not limited by platform makes the game even better – it was not like this at launch, but has since been implemented. Borderlands 3, however, does not have cross-progression, which means players will have to start a campaign from scratch should they choose to play on another platform.</p>
<p>7  Honkai: Star Rail
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC</p>
<p>Honkai: Star Rail</p>
<p>Platform(s)    PC , iOS , Android , PlayStation 5     Developer(s)    HoYoverse     Publisher(s)    HoYoverse     Genre(s)    Turn-Based Strategy , RPG , Adventure     Multiplayer    Online Multiplayer</p>
<p>Critic   Score    Screen Rant   4.5/5    Metacritic   80 <br>
From the same creators of Genshin Impact, HoYoverse, Honkai: Star Rail is a superb turn-based RPG. The title follows an epic adventure set in space in which players travel to various planets and meet various people on their quests to stop the threats posed by Stellarons.
A good thing is that this F2P game has a cross-save functionality that allows them to play on their computer, phone, or PlayStation 5 consoles. Honkai: Star Rail also has a cross-play function, that permits players to use featured characters from other players to challenge Calyces and boss fights – which comes in handy when they are lacking a certain type of elemental damage, for instance.</p>
<p>6  Apex Legends
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p>
