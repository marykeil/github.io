## Literature Review

It seems like one of the new Legendary Pokémon in the Indigo Disk has been hiding in the base games, Scarlet and Violet, for over a year.




A new Legendary Pokémon from the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has been hiding in the base game since its launch back in November 2022. The Indigo Disk is the second part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC pack, which was kicked off by The Teal Mask DLC. The first expansion took players on a field trip to the Land of Kitakami, where they met a few other Trainers, including Carmine and Kieran in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Both these Trainers are from Blueberrry Academy, the setting of the Indigo Disk DLC. Blueberry Academy is a sister school to Naranja and Uva Academies in Paldea.




While the conclusion of the campaign seems like the most important selling point for the DLC, another relevant aspect is the creatures. There will be several new and returning Pokémon in Indigo Disk, from 25 older Legendaries in the series to some new additions. There are also rumors and leaks of a new Pokémon type in the Indigo Disk DLC, which could change the game. Amidst all the exciting additions, however, it looks like one that was advertised as a new Legendary for the upcoming expansion has actually been hiding in Scarlet and Violet all along – it just took a while for players to notice.


 Terapagos Has Always Been In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
          

The Legendary Terapagos, which has been deemed as the most broken Pokémon ever by Indigo Disk leaks, has allegedly always been present in the base version of the Gen 9 games. As noted by the user known as SoulSilverArt on X, the Pokémon’s cry, which was revealed in the final trailer for the DLC shared on the official Pokémon channel on YouTube, is very similar – if not identical – to the sound of the Terastallization effect. Whenever players use their Tera Orb to Terastallize their Pokémon in battle, a crystal-like sound effect comes into play, and that may just be the same sound produced by Terapagos.






The sound of the Terastallization effect has been present in Scarlet and Violet since their release.






 Terapagos’ Connection To The Terastal Phenomenon In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet 
         

As seen in the post on X, SoulSilverArt speculates that Terapagos’ eyes may be what adorn the base of the Tera Jewels, popularly known as Tera Crowns. They also suggest that Terapagos is what resides inside the Tera Orb. It is well known that Terapagos has an important connection to the Terastal Phenomenon portrayed in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and probably to the Crystal Pool in Kitakami as well. The Legendary creature has “Tera” in its name, its Terastal Form carries the symbols for all Tera Types in the game, and leaks and rumors indicate that it may be the one responsible for the entire phenomenon in Paldea.





 

The post made on X is actually a response to another post made by SoulSilverArt earlier in 2023, in which they talked about how the animation for triggering the Terastallize effect with the Tera Orb is nearly identical to the animation of sending a completely new Pokémon into battle. The suggestion was that the Tera Jewel was actually another Pokémon – namely, the third Legendary, which was absent from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It is common for Legendary duos to be reigned by a third entity. Groudon and Kyogre and kept at bay by Rayquaza, for instance, while Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyurem compose the Tao trio in Unova.

                  All Pokémon That Can Be Transferred To Scarlet &amp; Violet From HOME   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are getting over 100 creatures and forms not previously obtainable in the Generation 9 games. Here are all of them.   




Pokémon Scarlet and Violet did not feature a third Legendary to serve as the mediator for Koraidon and Miraidon, so far referred to as the Paradox duo. Terapagos stems away from the standard design style used by the Dragon-type Pokémon, but it may as well serve as the third Legendary in the region of Paldea, even if it is not a part of their Legendary group per si. If Terapagos’ cry is, indeed, the same sound effect that plays when using the Tera Orb on a Pokémon in battle, then the third Legendary, which was allegedly lacking from the base games, has actually always been around.



 Pokémon Indigo Disk’s Terapagos May Be More Important Than Originally Thought 
          

Depending on how Terapagos is explored in the story told by the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon’s Gen 9 games, it may turn out to be a much more important creature than was originally thought. Terapagos is directly connected to the Terastal phenomenon and is suspected to be the source of the crystal-like energy that spreads across the region of Paldea. So far, it has had two forms advertised, but there are leaks and rumors about Pokémon Indigo Disk that suggest that Terapagos may have a third and more powerful form, which may be connected to the Terastal phenomenon itself.




There are also rumors that Terapagos may be directly linked to the new 19th type in the franchise, though it is still unknown if this is a permanent addition like the Fairy-type, or an exclusive type-based mechanic for Gen 9 games. Regardless, it seems like everything in Paldea – and even a bit in the land of Kitakami – revolves around Terapagos and its connection to the Terastal phenomenon. If all of this is even loosely true, Terapagos will be a lot more important than any Legendary released in Gen 9 so far, including Koraidon and Miraidon, the version-exclusive mascots for Scarlet and Violet.

There is also a chance of it being more important than Dokutaro in Pokémon Indigo Disk, a leaked Mythical Pokémon that is said to be the leader of the Loyal Three of Kitakami and the one responsible for altering Kieran’s behavior during the Teal Mask DLC. It is, allegedly, the big villain of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, even if it has not officially appeared. Even with Terapagos having a Legendary status as opposed to Dokutaro’s alleged Mythical ranking, the turtle-like creature may be more important. This is especially true if Terapagos is something of a protagonist who directly opposes the antagonism set by Dokutaro.




While the actual impact that Terapagos will have on the story is unknown, it does seem like the Legendary creature from the Indigo Disk DLC has been hiding in the base games all along. Players will uncover the truth and find out more once The Indigo Disk arrives for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14.
