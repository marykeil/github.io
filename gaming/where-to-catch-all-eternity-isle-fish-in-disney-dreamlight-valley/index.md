## Literature Review

The Disney Dreamlight Valley A Rift In Time Expansion includes the addition of three new biomes with 15 new species of fish &amp; seafood to catch.





There are three new biomes on Eternity Isle: Ancient&#39;s Landing, Glittering Dunes, and the Wild Tangle. Each area has seafood specific to its biome, meaning that these creatures cannot be caught elsewhere. Luckily, fishing on Eternity Isle works the same as it does on the mainland, so tracking them all down should be simple once you know where to look.




                  Where To Get a Fishing Rod in Disney Dreamlight Valley   To complete the &#34;The Royal Tools&#34; quest in Disney Dreamlight Valley, players must find a Fishing Rod hidden somewhere in the Peaceful Meadow.   


 Ancient&#39;s Landing Fish &amp; Seafood 
Four New Species
          

Ancient&#39;s Landing is the first biome players will encounter upon reaching Eternity Isle. There will be four new species to fish for in this biome, including the Octopus, Robot Fish, Sea Snail, and Shad. These are completely new as part of the Rift In Time expansion. However, some of the mainland fish can also be found here as well so don&#39;t be surprised if you hook one.

Specifically, Cod and Sole Fish from the mainland can be caught in Ancient&#39;s Landing. Additionally, though Ancient&#39;s Landing has four sub-regions, only two will contain all of these fish and those are The Docks and The Overlook.

 Glittering Dunes Fish &amp; Seafood 
Seven New Species
          

The Glittering Dunes are a biome on Eternity Isle in Disney Dreamlight Valley that will mostly need to be unlocked before all of it can be accessed and is also where players will discover Gaston. Once available, this biome will include the highest number of unique fish available in the Rift in Time expansion.

These include the Brilliant Blue Starfish, Pretty Pink Starfish, Dunebopper, Sand Fish, Sand Worm, Scorpion, and Skeleton Fish. In addition to these, Bass and Rainbow Trout from the mainland may also be caught in this area.






Unlike Ancient&#39;s Landing, not all new species will be found in the same sub-regions. Instead, they will vary within the different parts of the Glittering Dunes, so be sure to look everywhere.

 Wild Tangle Fish &amp; Seafood 
Four New Species
          




Similarly to Ancient&#39;s Landing, the Wild Tangle will only contain four new species to fish for, but it also contains the most mainland fish as well and is where players will meet Rapunzel in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Unfortunately, the Wild Tangle will need to be unlocked entirely before players will have access to all it has to offer.

Once unlocked, the new species found here include the Electric Eel, Pirahna, Pirarucu, and Prisma Shrimp. The mainland fish that can also be caught here include the Bass, Perch, Salmon, and Seaweed.



Before selling or consuming fish and seafood at face value, consider utilizing them in one of the many Disney Dreamlight Valley recipes that incorporate seafood. This is an easy way to dramatically increase the selling price or amount of energy replenished for hardly any cost.
