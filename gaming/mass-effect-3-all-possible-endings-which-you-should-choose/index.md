## Literature Review

There are five possible endings to Mass Effect 3. If Shepard amassed enough Military Strength, they can choose the fate of the entire galaxy.





[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Mass Effect 3.]




Following the run-up to the beam in Mass Effect 3, a badly injured Commander Shepard enters the Crucible and confronts the Catalyst. Depending on their Total Military Strength score, they will be presented with one to three options. There is a hidden fourth option, as well as a fifth possible outcome, sometimes called the Perfect Ending. The outcome players choose will depend on a few factors, including the consequences they are willing to live with and the morality of their unique Commander Shepard. Below, every possible ending to Mass Effect 3 is detailed, along with how to get the desired outcome, and which players should choose.

 Things That Impact Mass Effect 3&#39;s Ending 
         

There are five possible ways Mass Effect 3 can end. In Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the Military Strength system has been rebalanced, and Galactic Readiness has been done away with, so players will ultimately need more War Assets for a good outcome. War Assets contribute to the galaxy&#39;s Total Military Strength. If the Total Military Strength score is too low, it is possible the Catalyst will only give Shepard a single option based on what they did with the Collector base in Mass Effect 2. It is also possible for Shepard&#39;s squad to be killed and for Earth to be destroyed or badly ravaged, depending on the Total Military Strength score.




Unlike in the original series, the choices players made in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 can translate to War Assets in Mass Effect 3, contributing to the Total Military Strength score. This should make it easier for players to reach the threshold to keep Shepard&#39;s squad and Earth alive. Players should aim for around 7,800 as their target Total Military Strength score. This is the requirement for unlocking the Perfect Ending and should ensure every possible option is available.

 Every Mass Effect 3 Ending 

There are several ways the story can go at the end of Mass Effect 3, and if players have previously played Mass Effect 2, then the choices made in that game can further limit the outcome. Without enough Total Military Strength, Shepard will be forced to choose between Destroy or Control, as Synthesis will not appear. At extremely low Military Strength, they will only receive one or the other option, and the Refuse path. If Shepard chose to destroy the Collector base in Mass Effect 2, they will only have the option of the Control ending at the lowest Total Military Strength levels. If they chose to save the Collector base, they will only have access to the Destroy option at these lowest levels.




 Ending  Color  Outcome   Destroy  Red  Shepard can destroy the Reapers, but this will also destroy all synthetic life in the galaxy, including the Geth, EDI, and even Shepard&#39;s cybernetics. The Mass Relays are destroyed, making intergalactic travel difficult for a time. Destroy has the greatest possibility for collateral damage, as it can cause Earth to be vaporized entirely, and for the Normandy crew and Shepard&#39;s squad to die.   Control  Blue  Shepard can sacrifice themselves and merge with the Reapers, effectively taking control of them. Shepard uses the Reapers to rebuild the galaxy and continues controlling their existence. Control always results in full squad survival, and Earth can still be ravaged but not vaporized.   Synthesis  Green  Shepard can sacrifice themselves to merge all organic and synthetic life in the galaxy, preventing the Reapers from needing to continue the cycles. With this option, Earth survives, and Shepard&#39;s squad survives and are synthesized. This option is only available if players have enough Total Military Strength.   Refuse  N/A  After the Catalyst finishes explaining the options, Shepard can speak with it again. There will be an option to choose not to make a choice and to walk away from the Crucible. Alternatively, Shepard can shoot the Catalyst to trigger this ending. As a result, the Reapers finish what they started, and earth, Shepard&#39;s squad, and most organic life forms in the galaxy are destroyed.   Perfect Ending  Red  An offshoot of Destroy, the perfect ending is the only opportunity players have for Commander Shepard to live. If players have around 7,800 Total Military Strength or higher and select the Destroy ending, Shepard&#39;s love interest refuses to put their name on the Normandy&#39;s Memorial Wall. The debris of the Crucible is shown, along with Shepard taking a breath, having survived the explosion.   





Unless players have enough Total Military Strength and go for the Perfect Ending with Destroy, Shepard will always be killed in action. Synthesis and Control have no option where the Commander survives.






 How To Choose A Mass Effect 3 Ending 

While it seems the trajectory of the series, particularly when dealing with the Geth and Quarian conflict and the Krogan genophage, is pushing the player toward Synthesis, there are several drawbacks and moral consequences of that option that some players don&#39;t care for. Many fans suggest that, given that the objective throughout the entire Mass Effect trilogy was to defeat the Reapers and end the extinction cycle, Shepard ought to complete their goal and choose Destroy. This seems to be a popular option despite its difficult, sometimes heartbreaking consequences. It is also the only option if players want their Commander to survive.




To select an ending fitting for each unique Shepard&#39;s story, players should focus on the benefits and consequences outlined by the Catalyst for each choice. They should consider their Shepard&#39;s moral alignment and actions throughout the series, especially when dealing with synthetics and organics. Some fans also like to consider other aspects of their playthrough, like Shepard&#39;s background, their closest friends, and who they romanced. That will help them select an ending that best fits the story they have just experienced.

With so many possible endings to Mass Effect 3, there is ultimately no objectively correct or best ending. Each ending will resonate with different players for different reasons. Given the number of possible choices and outcomes in Mass Effect Legendary Edition, players can also try multiple endings on multiple playthroughs. This will allow them to experience each outcome and decide which one resonates most with them.
