Interact with him to start searching for all Legendary Pokémon in Indigo Disk, including Reshiram. These Legendary Pokémon are all unlocked through treats that he will give you for completing Solo and Group Blueberry Quests, or BBQs for short.

Reshiram is one of the easiest Pokémon to find after completing the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC. Once the Reshiram Treat has been gifted, Snacksworth will hint at where you can find Reshiram. Specifically, Reshiram will be on a hill above the town of Zapapico. The hill can be found in the Paldea region in the East Province (Area One) and is easy to reach by flying in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

Once you are prepared for a battle against Reshiram in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, make sure to save the game. This is a precaution if you run out of Poké Balls or healthy Pokémon to fight it. Fire- and Fairy-type Pokémon are the best matchups against Reshiram as they both resist its signature moves. Weaken it to mid or low level on its health bar and try your luck at catching the Legendary Pokémon.

Smeargle is one of the best helper Pokémon for trainers looking to catch Pokémon easily. This is because it can learn any move. Making Smeargle learn moves like Spore, False Swipe, Pay Day, and Super Fang is helpful for catching any Legendary in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
