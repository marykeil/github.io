## Literature Review

Screen Rant had some memorable interactions with some of the gaming industry&#39;s most interesting and insightful members. Take a look.




With the bar for quality in gaming being raised even further in 2023, a lot of questions have emerged. How sustainable was this kind of progression for the long term? Can we expect this many legitimate Game of the Year contenders in 2024? Just how much has the idea of industry standouts as individuals or brands broken into the mainstream?
While the former two questions won&#39;t have answers for a while yet, we can confidently answer the latter: 2023 was an insightful look into some of gaming&#39;s biggest personalities and contributors. At Screen Rant, we interviewed so many interesting people, ranging from game directors to sound engineers to actors. All of them had something to share, and some of them made headlines with their intelligent breakdown of facets of gaming we don&#39;t always get to peer into so directly. Here&#39;s a collection of some of our favorite gaming interviews from 2023.
            
 
 Screen Rant&#39;s 2023 Game Of The Year 
Screen Rant&#39;s Game of the Year 2023 is Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, a testament to how much space remains for grand storytelling and characters.












 








 Neil Newbon 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 actor, Astarion 
            
 
 Neil Newbon On Being &#34;Incredibly Blessed By Astarion&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
Neil Newbon discusses playing companion Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, helping direct his fellow actors, and the game&#39;s incredible possibilities.



Neil Newbon is the voice behind the vampire spawn Astarion in Larian Studios&#39; wildly successful Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. He also took home the Best Performance award at The Game Awards 2023, as his character delivered some of the most memorable and witty lines. We discussed his role with him in this interview, where he described Astarion as a &#34;blessing.&#34;
&#34;I&#39;ve worked for great game companies in the past, I&#39;ve never experienced that level of love, support, interest, and genuine friendships coming through on a project. It&#39;s been extraordinary actually. Friendships beyond the cast and the director as well, I&#39;ve been getting to know the devs so well that I&#39;ll actually give them a shout every other day, go for coffee. It&#39;s very cool. I know I&#39;m gushing quite a lot.&#34; 






 Devora Wilde 
Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 actor, Lae&#39;zel 
            
 
 Devora Wilde Wants Players To &#34;Give Lae&#39;zel A Chance&#34; In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
Devora Wilde discusses playing githyanki companion Lae&#39;zel, the complexity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s narrative and githyanki culture clashes. 



Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 was a movement, and we took notice, trying to pick the brains of anyone involved to figure out the smaller details of the game&#39;s greater success. Actor Devora Wilde was the voice behind Lae&#39;zel, a companion who was one of the more misunderstood upon the game&#39;s release. Wilde&#39;s insight into Lae&#39;zel helped convince people to give her character a chance, which was for the best; Lae&#39;zel&#39;s backstory gets interesting quickly, and her story reveals she&#39;s a lot deeper than she first appears.
&#34;You know what it’s only now that we started talking to people and doing interviews that I’ve had a couple of people ask me, “did you see Lae’zel as evil, she’s an evil character.” But actually, when we started the recording, it was never ever mentioned that she is an evil character. And I definitely don’t see her like that. I think she certainly does some questionable things and reacts questionably in certain situations which, you know, some characters wouldn’t necessarily act like that.&#34; 






 Zhenyu Li 
Producer, Zenless Zone Zero 
            
 
 Zenless Zone Zero Producer Zhenyu Li: &#34;I Don&#39;t Think There&#39;s Too Much Pressure On Us&#34; 
Zenless Zone Zero producer Zhenyu Li says he doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s too much pressure on the team to follow the success of Genshin and Honkai Star Rail



Sitting down with producer Zhenyu Li at Gamescom 2023 was both fascinating and a welcome break. Secluded away from the clamor of the showfloor, we engaged in an hour-long discussion about HoYoverse&#39;s Zenless Zone Zero. Distinctly different from both Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, it&#39;s clear that the game has high expectations from fans - but what about internally? Li was able to provide some excellent insight into the freedom his team had been given during development.
&#34;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s too much pressure on us. That&#39;s also something that I speak about with my team. We&#39;re not competing, and we&#39;re not comparing ourselves to any of the other products. What really matters is to produce a great product and a refined product. Constantly thinking about it is not going to help anything. What I want to do is to make sure that we&#39;re producing an excellent product that we&#39;re also happy with ourselves. Whether or not it is ultimately going to be welcomed by the community? That&#39;s really up to the players. All I can do really is produce a product that is as good as it can be.&#34; 






 Adam Z. Jackson 
Lead Class Designer, Diablo 4 
            
 
 &#34;We Don&#39;t Want To Overwhelm Players&#34;: Diablo 4 Devs On Skills &amp; Class Design 
Screen Rant attended an interview with Diablo 4 developers to discuss the game’s focus on players&#39; ability to customize their characters and gameplay.



As part of a round table, we were able to ask Lead Class Designer Adam Z. Jackson about Diablo 4&#39;s skill trees and paragon boards. The game wasn&#39;t out yet and players were eager to learn more about the systems that could potentially keep them on the hook for the action RPG title for months following its release. Jackson&#39;s answer demonstrated the team&#39;s thoughtfulness in getting players onboarded into a game that can be overwhelming for first-timers.
&#34;We don&#39;t want to overwhelm players, we don&#39;t want the number of choices they have at the beginning to be too large, and that&#39;s why when you look at the entire skill tree at once it can be a decent amount of things to draw, but you have to remember that we actually space out almost all of the customization content as far as the character and build creation over a long period of time while you&#39;re playing. So, you&#39;re not going to see or need to care about everything all at once.&#34; 






 Naoki Yoshida 
Director &amp; Producer, Final Fantasy 14 
            
 
 Final Fantasy XIV&#39;s 10th Anniversary, Job Design, Expansions, &amp; Successes: An Interview With Naoki Yoshida 
We chat with Naoki Yoshida about Final Fantasy XIV&#39;s 10th anniversary. How hard is it to design jobs now? What&#39;s the best expansion? Find out.



The face of Final Fantasy 14, director and producer Naoki Yoshida has been working on the incredibly successful MMORPG for 10 years. We got to chat with him about what the game&#39;s 10th anniversary meant to him and what it means for the game&#39;s future. Yoshida, as always, was insightful and thoughtful with his responses, and even shed some light on the game&#39;s job design process.
&#34;To be quite honest, I admit adding new jobs is getting rather cumbersome. (laughs) We haven’t run out of ideas, but with the increasing number of jobs in each role, maintaining the uniqueness of their job mechanics while balancing their numbers as closely as possible has become extremely taxing. Not to mention how adding more jobs multiplies the number of gear assets for rewards, which is yet another obstacle… That said, new jobs are the biggest highlight of an expansion. The Development team and I would like to keep adding them as long as we can, but perhaps we’ll eventually come up with something even more attractive—not that I have any ideas at the moment! (laughs)&#34;
