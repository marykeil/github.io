 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: All Backgrounds (And Which To Use) 
Picking a Background in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a key part of character creation and lets players give their characters new skills and a rich backstory. 












 








 10  Soldier And Paladin 
Smart Tactics And Bravery
        

The Soldier background in BG3 is about winning battles and acting strategically, and pairs very well with the paladin class. Soldier grants proficiency in Athletics for feats of strength like shoving enemies in battle to control the field better and Intimidation, which will also be boosted by the paladin&#39;s main stat Charisma.
A lot of the acts to earn inspiration with the Soldier background are generally quite heroic, which works well with a lawful paladin playthrough, such as following the Flaming Fist&#39;s orders at Waukeen&#39;s Rest or defeating a powerful enemy with one strike.





 9  Noble And Sorcerer 
Power, Privilege And Status
        

As a Noble, a character would have a focus on social standing, interacting with officials, and using privilege to gain rewards. This works really well with the sorcerer class, as the innate magic in their blood lends itself to a sense of entitlement.
Nobles gain proficiency in History to better demonstrate their superior education and Persuasion, which will be boosted by the sorcerer&#39;s Charisma stat to manipulate others throughout Baldur’s Gate 3.





 8  Charlatan And Bard 
Manipulation, Tricks And Scams
        

The Charlatan background has a focus on tricking people for profit and amusement, with many of the actions that grant inspiration to those that use words to avoid violence. The bard class works great with Charlatan as not all bards are musical performers and this BG3 background is perfect for roleplay as a conman type of bard who runs scams to earn gold.
Charlatans gain proficiency in Deception, which will be boosted by the bard&#39;s Charisma stats to fool anyone the bard crosses paths with, and Sleight of Hand to pick the odd pocket or two.





 7  Folk Hero And Ranger 
Monster Hunting And Survival
        

While many rangers prefer to live in the wilderness, there are some whose deeds become legends, and that&#39;s where the BG3 Folk Hero background comes in. This background focuses on helping the common folk against monsters and tyrants and works well with the ranger as this class would come face to face with all sorts of creatures in the wild.
Folk Heroes gain proficiency in Animal Handling and Survival, two skills that pair perfectly with the ranger&#39;s skill set. 

            
 
 How To Respec &amp; Change Class In Baldur’s Gate 3 
To respec or change character class in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players must recruit Withers from his tomb on the Ravaged Beach near the Emerald Grove.








 6  Outlander And Barbarian 
Surviving Alone In The Wild


 







The Outlander background is a strange mix of surviving anything the world can throw at a character and learning something new from those encounters. From a roleplay and earning inspiration viewpoint in BG3, this means acts such as uncovering hidden threats or fully exploring an area like the Mind Flayer Colony.
This background pairs well with barbarians due to their survivability in combat but also the skill proficiencies gained. Outlanders gain proficiency in Survival to help better spot secrets and Athletics, which will be boosted by the barbarian&#39;s Strength stat and useful from the beginning to the end of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.





 5  Soldier And Fighter 
Battlefield Prowess And Defeating Enemies


 







Just as with the paladin, the Soldier background pairs effortlessly with the fighter class in BG3. As many of the acts that reward inspiration involve defeating enemies and clever tactics, it makes sense that a skilled fighter would have once been a soldier or mercenary. The skill proficiencies further partner well with Athletics boosted by the fighter&#39;s Strength for shove attacks and Intimidation adding to the fighter&#39;s authority.





 4  Acolyte And Cleric 
Serving The Gods And Remaining Faithful


 







The Acolyte background solely focuses on faith, worship, and the gods of Faerûn which makes sense to pair it with the cleric class. This allows the cleric character to gain inspiration very easily through acts such as praying, learning or knowing about other faiths, and discovering religious relics.
The skill proficiencies gained from the Acolyte background further enhance this with Religion and Insight, both adding to the roleplay and gameplay aspects of this combo.





 3  Sage And Wizard 
Learning And Lore


 







The Sage background is all about knowledge, seeking it out, and learning all the lore Faerûn has to offer. This obviously works very well with the wizard class, who study for years to learn their spells.
Both the Sage&#39;s skill proficiencies are Intelligence-based, with Arcana and History pairing well with a wizard&#39;s desire to master magic in all its forms. As with the Acolyte cleric, the Sage wizard will be able to earn inspiration in BG3 very easily by reading texts, uncovering secrets, and solving puzzles.

 2  Entertainer And Bard 
Music, Stories And Art
        

While some bards will work well as a Charlatan, others fall into the more traditional bardic backgrounds as Entertainers. The Entertainer background rewards inspiration for the bard putting on a show and supporting the arts. This can be achieved by saving fellow artists Volo and Oskar or by sabotaging the press in Act 3.
The Entertainer gains proficiency in Acrobatics, which has limited uses in BG3, but more importantly, Performance which will help wow the crowds for impromptu musical performances on the streets of Baldur&#39;s Gate.





 1  Criminal And Rogue 
Stealing And Stealth
        

Finally, the best background and class combo in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is a match made in heaven with the Criminal and rogue. The Criminal background focuses on breaking the law and using less than legal means to achieve the party&#39;s goals. Inspiration is gained by picking pockets, murdering innocents, and escaping jail, which pair perfectly with the rogue who lives in the shadows.
The Criminal gains proficiency in Deception which comes in handy when the rogue is caught where they shouldn&#39;t be and Stealth which enhances the rogue&#39;s sneak attack. Overall, this combo is awesome as it works for both roleplaying and gameplay, making the Criminal Rogue tons of fun to play.
