## Literature Review

Steam&#39;s newest big hit is a real dark horse candidate, but its unstoppable rise over the course of a month shows that it has no shortage of appeal.




The PC market has had its fair share of breakout hits this year, perhaps most notably in the widespread popularity of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, but one game has just performed a trick that might be even more impressive. Although the platform has long been a home to a variety of successful indie games for PC, the top sellers on Steam typically skew toward AAA releases. When a game does claw its way to the top without the same kind of funding, it&#39;s often on a rare wave of cultural interest, like with the meteoric rise of Among Us in 2020.




The newest game to rise to the challenge is Lethal Company, a co-op experience built around a simple gameplay loop of scavenging facilities for loot that can be sold to meet increasing quotas. The dark shadows of the game hold monsters, however, posing a challenge to the successful recovery of items and giving the experience a minor hint of horror. Currently available as an Early Access release, Lethal Company commands a modest price tag of $9.99 for an experience that&#39;s already generally stable and complete despite its limited scope.

                  10 RPGs On PC You Won&#39;t Regret Sinking 100&#43; Hours Into   Free time is a luxury, but the best expansive RPGs on PC make it well-worth spending with engaging journeys and interesting possibilities.   


 Lethal Company Is At The Top Of The Steam Charts 
          




Reaching the top of the Steam top-selling charts is an enviable position, and Lethal Company has managed to take the number one spot around a month after its initial release on Steam. It&#39;s best described as a word-of-mouth phenomenon, as the first exposure to Lethal Company for most Steam users has likely been hearing about it from a friend or getting a pop-up that someone has entered the game. The low price point and co-op elements make it an appealing purchase, but the real trick is in just how effectively the game has won the love of many who pick it up.

                  One Of Steam&#39;s Most-Wishlisted PC Games Finally Launches Next Week   One of Steam’s top wishlist games has seen multiple delays over the course of its development, but it’s finally due to release next week.    



 Lethal Company&#39;s Reception Is Overwhelmingly Positive 
          




The Lethal Company store page on Steam shows just how enthusiastic the response to the game has been, with 98% of its roughly 90,000 reviews giving it the thumbs-up. This level of near unanimity is unsurprisingly difficult to find with any game that&#39;s reached such a wide audience. Lethal Company may not be for everyone — there&#39;s always a chance that its simple tasks and spooks could fail to register — but it&#39;s proven to be effective for the vast majority of players. Considering its Early Access state, it might get even better in the future, and it&#39;s already more polished than many titles with official releases.

                  There&#39;s One Big Problem With Dave The Diver&#39;s Best Indie Nomination At TGA 2023   Dave the Diver is great, but its Best Indie Game nomination at The Game Awards 2023 has caused a stir. Here’s why, and what should be done.   

Whatever the future does hold for Lethal Company, its current success is undeniably striking, and it&#39;s encouraging to see a small indie title do so well. It also points to the general desire for easy pick-up-and-play co-op games, as the social aspect adds a lot of humor and variety to the experience. Lethal Company might not have the same scope of content and production value as most top sellers on Steam, but this PC game has managed to defy the odds to become a nearly overnight sensation.
