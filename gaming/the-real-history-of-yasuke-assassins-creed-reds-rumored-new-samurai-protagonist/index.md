# The Real History Of Yasuke, Assassins Creed Reds Rumored New Samurai Protagonist


## SUMMARY 



  Leaks claim that Assassin&#39;s Creed Codename Red will feature a protagonist based on the real historical figure of Yasuke.   Yasuke&#39;s backstory in the game may take some creative license, potentially making it inaccurate. His role in Japan&#39;s Sengoku period is well-documented.   Yasuke fought alongside Oda Nobunaga and rose to the rank of samurai, but his true story ends with Nobunaga&#39;s death and his own disappearance from history.

## Literature Review

Rumor has it the protagonist of Assassin’s Creed Red will be based on the historical figure of Yasuke, a Black samurai in Oda Nobunaga’s army.






This article contains mention of slavery and suicide.







Leaks suggest that the protagonist of the upcoming Assassin&#39;s Creed Codename Red will be directly based on the real historical figure of Yasuke, a Black samurai who played a major role in a pivotal period of Japanese history. It&#39;s far from the first time Assassin&#39;s Creed has portrayed real people throughout history. The series has always included historical figures in a wide variety of contexts, although they&#39;re usually relegated to allyships or side quests. If the rumors are true, Yasuke would be the first Assassin&#39;s Creed protagonist to be based on a real historical figure - although the game certainly seems to take some creative license in telling his story.

According to a leak reported by Insider Gaming, Assassin’s Creed Red will portray Yasuke as the sole survivor of an attack on a slave ship. He’ll be one of two protagonists in the game, splitting screen time with a Japanese woman named Naoe on a quest of revenge. It certainly makes for a dramatic story, but there’s reason to believe Yasuke&#39;s backstory in Assassin&#39;s Creed Red is at least partially inaccurate. However, historical sources pertaining to his real life are incomplete and at times contradictory. So who was the real Yasuke?




                  Assassin’s Creed Codename Red Might Release Earlier Than Expected   New evidence suggests that the upcoming Feudal Japan-based Assassin’s Creed Codename Red might release earlier than expected.    


 Yasuke&#39;s Early Years 
          

The time and place of Yasuke&#39;s birth are uncertain, but based on later reports of his age and abilities, it can be assumed that he was born during the 1550s. He is known to have been born in Africa, although in what country is not clear. Many have speculated he was born in either present-day Ethiopia, South Sudan, or Mozambique. Records of his later life state that he was able to speak Swahili, which was historically spoken in northern Mozambican port towns. His Japanese moniker may derive from the Yao people of northern Mozambique, Malawi, and Tanzania, appended to the common samurai name suffix &#34;-suke.&#34;




While there&#39;s no way to definitively determine whether Yasuke came to Japan as a slave, a common practice of the era suggests otherwise. Yasuke arrived on the shores of Japan in 1579, along with the Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano. Valignano was one of many Christian missionaries to visit Japan during the 16th century. However, this journey often represented a danger to life and limb.

It was the midst of Japan&#39;s Sengoku period, in which several warring states led by rich and powerful daimyo warlords vied for territory. Jesuit priests weren&#39;t permitted to carry weapons themselves, so they often brought along valets who happened to be skilled in the art of war. These were paid, hired hands, not slaves. It&#39;s possible that Yasuke numbered among them, and his later prowess in battle demonstrates that he was certainly capable enough of acting as a bodyguard.

Missionaries in Japan often sought to catch the attention of daimyo, since their money and influence meant they could continue to spread the religious message to their armies. And so, in 1581, Yasuke and Valignano wound up meeting with Oda Nobunaga at one of his castles in Kyoto. Then one of the most powerful warlords in the region, Nobunaga is now known as one of the nation&#39;s Great Unifiers for his role in collecting a loose group of militarized bands into the single country of Japan. He was fascinated by foreign culture, and often received travelers who could teach him more about the subject.

                  Japanese Mythology Assassin&#39;s Creed Red Could Use   The Assassin&#39;s Creed franchise is finally heading to feudal Japan soon, and there are some essential myths and folklore that Ubisoft should include.    

Nobunaga threw his visitors a party, where he and his followers marveled at Yasuke&#39;s height and strength. It&#39;s unknown just how Yasuke impressed Nobunaga, but a near-contemporary illustration might provide a hint. The 1605 work Sumo Yurakuzu Byobu, by an unnamed artist, depicts a dark-skinned man participating in a wrestling match while noble samurai look on. Art historians have theorized that one of the other figures in the painting is Nobunaga, who was known to have a penchant for sumo. This could mean the wrestler was Yasuke himself.




But one way or another, Yasuke was offered a position in Nobunaga&#39;s army, and he accepted. He obviously continued to make an impression on Nobunaga, for he soon rose to the rank of samurai, and was welcomed into Nobunaga&#39;s inner circle. A Portuguese missionary, Luís Fróis, wrote in his Annual Report on Japan that Yasuke could understand some Japanese, and he would often carry on long conversations with Nobunaga. Yasuke may have been able to recite Utenzi, a form of Swahili epic poetry, which the Noh theatre-loving Nobunaga likely would have appreciated.

Yasuke fought alongside Nobunaga as he defeated the Takeda clan and captured the province of Iga. According to Fróis, Nobunaga paid and housed Yasuke, and sometimes hired an attendant to accompany him about Kyoto. Rumors swirled that Nobunaga intended to make Yasuke a lord with a castle of his own. Whether those rumors were true isn&#39;t clear, but either way, Nobunaga never had the opportunity.



 Nobunaga&#39;s End And Yasuke&#39;s Disappearance 
          




Nobunaga had almost achieved total unification by 1582. In the final stages of his campaign, and as he traveled through his own territory on his way to a skirmish at Sakamoto Castle, he believed he was safe. He brought with him only 30 men from his entourage, including Yasuke. When he was suddenly ambushed by his own vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide, and a retinue of 13,000, there was little Nobunaga could do.

In the ensuing chaos, Nobunaga&#39;s elbow was wounded by an enemy spear. Unable to fight and loath to surrender, Nobunaga secluded himself within the nearby Honnoji Temple, where he committed ritual suicide to avoid death or capture at the enemy&#39;s hands. Yasuke, meanwhile, kept fighting. He joined the army of Nobunaga&#39;s son, Oda Nobutada, as they arrived to join the fray. Nobutada had a larger contingent following him, but they were still outmatched by Mitsuhide. Nobutada&#39;s army was defeated. Yasuke was captured by Mitsuhide, and taken to a Jesuit mission house. After that, nothing further is known of Yasuke&#39;s life.






 Yasuke In Popular Culture 
Yasuke Has Appeared In Samurai Warriors And Nioh
         

As a singularly captivating figure, Yasuke has inspired countless works of popular culture. He first featured as the protagonist of the Japanese children&#39;s book Kuro-suke, by Kurusu Yoshio. Later, the manga (and anime adaptation of) Afro Samurai took inspiration from Yasuke&#39;s life. The Netflix anime Yasuke portrays a fantastical retelling of the period after Yasuke&#39;s disappearance, replete with robots and magic. Assassin&#39;s Creed Red wouldn&#39;t be his first video game appearance, either; Yasuke appears in the Samurai Warriors series as a playable character, and in Nioh 2 as a boss.

The gaps in records of Yasuke&#39;s life provide ample opportunity for creative license, which Assassin&#39;s Creed certainly seems to be taking. It&#39;s not yet known whether the protagonist will be presented as Yasuke himself, or simply a similar figure. Either way, the character&#39;s inspirations are clear. Hopefully, Assassin&#39;s Creed Codename Red can do some justice to this complicated figure&#39;s legacy.
