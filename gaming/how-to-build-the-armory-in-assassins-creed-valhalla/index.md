## Literature Review

One of the structures you can build for your settlement in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla is the Ravensthorpe Armory, but this project demands many items.





The only location where you can build an Armory is in a Level 3 or higher settlement you&#39;ve chosen to expand in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla. Creating the Armory is easy and requires you to spend 100 Foreign Supplies once your settlement meets this prerequisite. However, upgrades are far more expensive and cost upwards of 1,200 supplies to unlock every aspect of the structure.






The easiest way to upgrade a settlement to Level 3 or higher for the Armory is to construct other buildings around Ravensthorpe and upgrade pre-existing structures that are already there.

 How To Get Foreign Supplies For AC Valhalla&#39;s Armory 
          

The Armory for Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla has three possible upgrades totaling 2,500 Foreign Supplies for all five available loadouts. The only way to gain Foreign Supplies is to participate in River Raids, which give you resources as you plunder areas around the countryside. Unfortunately, the cargo capacity that determines how much you get from a raid isn&#39;t too much at the start.




Initially, you only get 250 Supplies from one Raid, but you can change this by buying upgrades for your cargo capacity in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla. It costs 450 Supplies to boost your capacity once, then 750 Supplies to do it again. Fully upgrading your cargo capacity allows you to gather a maximum of 450 Foreign Supplies during one River Raid.

Eivar can access the River Raid mode in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla by going to the dock and speaking to the NPC Vagn near the water. You can raid several locations along the river and get resources to gain Foreign Supplies for your continuing Armory project. Each location you pillage could also provide new gear or abilities, so make sure to check what each one offers.

When you participate in a raid, you can check your ship&#39;s capacity to see when it reaches the full amount of Supplies it can carry. Exit the Raid when your ship is full to collect the total Supplies, then start a new raid to continue gathering the resources for the Armory&#39;s upgrades. Return to the Armory to see which loadouts are available for Eivar to equip once it&#39;s finished.

Anyone who knows how to use loadouts in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla should know how each is tied to Eivar&#39;s armor, weapons, and abilities in the game. The inventory menu lets you clear custom loadouts and equip the various gear pieces you&#39;ve found throughout your adventure. A fully upgraded Armory can display five of your strongest loadouts at a time for you to swap between freely.

Some players might set up a stealth build in one Armory slot to display proudly alongside a tank or combat loadout with different gear in their settlement. The ease of access to your strongest sets lets you admire the look of your gear and the effectiveness of certain loadouts. Each loadout will be on an armor stand, with whatever weapons are tied to that equipment mounted on the nearby wall.




Those who learn how to build the Ravensthorpe Armory in Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla can customize it however they wish and show off how versatile a warrior Eivar can truly be.
