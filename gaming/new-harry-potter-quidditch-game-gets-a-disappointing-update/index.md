# New Harry Potter Quidditch Game Gets A Disappointing Update


## SUMMARY 



  Warner Bros. Games has provided very few details about the release of the multiplayer game, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, which was revealed in April 2023.   The most recent update on the game shows it still lacks a release window, and the platforms it&#39;s releasing on still haven&#39;t been specified.   The ongoing playtests for Quidditch Champions suggest progress is being made, but the game seems to still be far from release.

## Literature Review

Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions finally got an update following its reveal nine months ago, but the new info isn’t exactly promising.




The upcoming, multiplayer Wizarding World video game, announced as Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, has received a rather disappointing update, as apparently very few details about its release have been determined by publisher Warner Bros. Games. On the heels of Hogwarts Legacy&#39;s best-selling success in 2023, Warner Bros., under its Portkey Games publishing label, has partnered with developer Unbroken Studios to deliver an experience based around the iconic wizarding sport, which was notably absent from Hogwarts Legacy. Quidditch Champions, however, doesn&#39;t even have a broad release window, nor has the title been committed to any specific platforms other than PC.




Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions was revealed in April 2023, and roughly nine months later, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad told Variety, &#34;We don&#39;t have any particular announcements on exactly how and when [the Quidditch game] is going to come to the market, but we are working to get it designed in a way just to delight fans.&#34; While the statement is fairly innocuous for a game in development, being unable to comment on both when and how Quidditch Champions will arrive may be dampening for those who were hoping to play the game soon.

                  Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions - Release Date Info, Price, &amp; Platforms   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is coming to bring the world back to the iconic magical sport. Here’s all the info available on what to expect.   


 Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions&#39; Release May Be Far Off &amp; Its Platforms Are Still Unclear 
          




Playtests for Quidditch Champions began shortly after its reveal. Players can sign up on the Quidditch Champions website, though it appears to be only for PC, as the site&#39;s FAQ notes the game &#34;will be available for PC and consoles which have not yet been confirmed.&#34; The FAQ also reinforces the fact that a release date has not been set yet. The playtests themselves are likely instrumental for the development of the competitive multiplayer title, but the unwillingness to commit to any platforms aside from PC suggests Quidditch Champions may not be especially close to completion.

There are a few possible explanations for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions&#39; early reveal, in addition to attracting playtesters. First is the industry&#39;s continued transition to ninth-generation home consoles. While 2024 will be the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S&#39;s fourth full year on the market, if Quidditch Champions is able to run on older hardware, it would be able to reach a much larger audience. Similarly, Warner Bros. Games could be awaiting the potential 2024 launch of the Nintendo Switch&#39;s successor, which may impact the platforms the developers target.




Ultimately, the odd wording about &#34;how and when&#34; Quidditch Champions will come to market likely isn&#39;t anything to fret over. It may be disappointing to hear that the game won&#39;t be available soon, but it&#39;s likely better for Warner Bros. Games and Unbroken Studios to remain mum instead of making promises in an ever-shifting industry. Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions appears to still be fairly far from release, but the ongoing playtests are promising, even if the publisher is still figuring out the logistics of actually launching the title.
