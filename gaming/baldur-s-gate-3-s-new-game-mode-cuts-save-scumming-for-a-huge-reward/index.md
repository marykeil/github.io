## Literature Review

Patch 5 in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 introduces two new game modes, including one that will cut out save scumming in exchange for an excellent reward.




Patch 5 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is officially releasing, and this latest patch is packed with new additions and changes. Patch 5 includes a new epilogue, two new game modes, and over 3,500 new lines. Boss tweaks and a new Legendary Actions system are also part of the latest update. However, one of the new game modes also offers the change to net players an incredible award - the Golden D20.




The two new game modes in Patch 5 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 are Honour Mode and Custom Mode. Honour Mode makes the game more difficult, and this is where over 30 new tweaks to boss fights and the Legendary Action system come into play. One of the biggest obstacles, however, is that Honour Mode has save scumming disabled, adding even more of a challenge. It will, of course, be easy to die in this new game mode, but those who can survive in Honour Mode will get the Golden D20 upon beating the entire game.

  


 Honour Mode In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Ups The Challenge 
          

While the new Custom Mode is designed for those who want easier gameplay, with the ability to hide failed checks and short rests that fully heal the party being included. However, Honour Mode is all about the challenge. And when the player dies, they will get stats showing just how much progress they made — like how long they survived and how far into the story they made it before dying. It will be no easy feat, which is why the Golden D20 is likely to stay a rare (but highly desired) award.




 : One Bad Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Decision Is Actually The Best Choice

In addition to these changes, Patch 5 also has improved inventory access, now letting players manage their companions&#39; inventories with one UI, even if that companion isn&#39;t currently in the party. Additionally, Patch 5 has performance improvements from the Xbox version of Baldur’s Gate 3, but these improvements are on all systems.

Patches in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 have given the game a lot of life post-launch, and Patch 5 has an impressive amount of new content. The epilogue, which takes place 6 months later, may be the biggest draw, but these two new game modes offer flexibility and replay value. Beyond that, the Golden D20 should entice those looking for bragging rights in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
