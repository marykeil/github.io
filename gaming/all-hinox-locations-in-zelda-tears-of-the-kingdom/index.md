## Literature Review

A Hinox is an ogre boss found throughout Tears of the Kingdom who drops both ingredients and monster parts. Hinoxes are both above and below ground.





While you can avoid these boss fights, beating them yields powerful monster parts and other ingredients that Link can use later. You can stun Hinoxes by shooting an arrow into their eyes; however, they still require a bit of dexterity when battling them. Although Black Hinoxes are the rarest type of Hinox in the game, they drop the strongest and most potent monster parts that can be used as Fuse materials in Zelda: TOTK.

 Hinox Locations In The Depths 
          

Unlike the overworld of Hyrule, you can find only 29 Hinoxes in the Depths of Hyrule in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, be careful when approaching Hinoxes in the depths as they are infected with Gloom, making them even harder to beat than normal Hinozes. Before heading out to beat Gloom-infested Hinoxes, make sure to carry anti-Gloom dishes, Elixirs, and the Zelda: TOTK&#39;s best Armor sets that work well against Gloom enemies.
