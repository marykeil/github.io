## Literature Review

Avatar: Frontiers has an impressive map, but just how big is it? Here’s what it looks like compared to another recent Ubisoft release, Far Cry 6.




Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has a huge, open-world map, but just how huge is it? As far as its approach to open-world mapping, it mostly follows the typical Ubisoft approach. One large map is presented as a single whole, and players are encouraged to explore at will. The map begins obscured by fog of war, which slowly clears as more locations are revealed. In particular, its overall structure is most similar to Ubisoft&#39;s Far Cry series, especially its most recent release, Far Cry 6.




However, it does make one major departure: Frontiers of Pandora has two map &#34;difficulty&#34; modes, Guided and Exploration. Either way, though, there are almost no restrictions on travel. Free exploration is incentivized by a variety of fascinating sights and points of interest located just off Pandora&#39;s more beaten paths. Still, its map is similar in size to some of Ubisoft&#39;s prior open-world releases, and looking at them side-by-side, it&#39;s possible to come to a conclusion.

                  &#34;A Staggering Sensory Experience&#34; - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a stunning foray into a beautiful world that features enough good ideas to forgive its share of shortcomings.   


 Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora&#39;s Map Rivals Far Cry 6&#39;s 
But It May Be A Little Smaller
         

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s map is similar in size to Far Cry 6&#39;s, but appears to be just a tad smaller. It&#39;s a bit difficult to compare the two, since things are rarely portrayed in a perfect, one-to-one scale on either map. Settlements, bases, and other points of interest are often represented by generic pin icons that don&#39;t necessarily represent their scale, but instead their relative positioning. Aerial views of them, however, do appear on the map.




Naturally, the two maps also have wildly different geographical forms. Far Cry 6 is set on the small island nation of Yara, mostly broken up into four distinct regions: Esperanza, Madrugada, Valle del Oro, and El Este. It also contains two smaller, more limited regions: Isla Santuario, the site of the game&#39;s tutorial, and Isla del Leon, the site of its climax and final boss battle. Overall, Far Cry 6&#39;s map size is estimated to be about 34 square miles (88 square kilometers).

By contrast, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora takes place on a single, large landmass, which isn&#39;t implied to be an island - it&#39;s just a slice of a larger continent. It&#39;s split into three regions: Clouded Forest, Kinglor Forest, and Upper Plains. Both the regions in Far Cry 6 and those in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are further divided into various subregions, which tend to be defined by the natural boundaries and geographical features that separate them. On average, the regions appear to be about equal in size, but since Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora only has three main regions compared to Far Cry 6&#39;s four, it appears to be slightly smaller.




                  Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Fixes A Growing Problem With Open-World Games   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora isn&#39;t out yet, but one decision could go a long way in making it stand out from the crowd of open-world games.   

Assuming they&#39;re all exactly the same size (which they aren&#39;t), that&#39;d mean Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&#39;s map takes up roughly 25.5 square miles (66 square kilometers). That doesn&#39;t provide a totally accurate calculation, but it can help come to an estimate.



 Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora&#39;s Map Modes Explained: Guided Or Exploration? 
          

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has two settings that affect the level of detail displayed on the map, as well as the primary method of navigation through its world. The two available options are called Guided Mode and Exploration Mode. Players may choose from either mode when starting a new game, but can always change the settings later. Here&#39;s how each of the two works in-game.




Guided Mode employs a highly typical, modern ARPG approach to mapping and navigation. Players are easily guided to wherever they need to be through the use of map markers. Points of interest are labeled on the map with color-coded pins, and quests are marked with waypoints. Neither, however, appears on the HUD&#39;s compass; players will have to make custom waypoints for that. While walking or flying around, players can use an ability called Hunter&#39;s Sense to view nearby quest markers without having to open the map. It&#39;s ideal for players who want to complete the main story quickly, or who don&#39;t want to worry too much about navigation.

                  How Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Connects To The Way Of Water   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora tells its own unique story, but will be canon to the movies, taking place around the same time as The Way of Water.   

Exploration Mode, however, requires a little more player involvement. It&#39;s closer to an old-school approach to RPG mapping, and creates a more immersive experience. In Exploration Mode, regions and subregions are still labeled on the map, but quest waypoints aren&#39;t. When a player begins a quest, they&#39;ll get some vague notes that point them in the right direction. For example, they may need to find a Na&#39;vi settlement in Gossamer Lakes. They can glance at the map and quickly determine where the Gossamer Lakes region is, but the actual quest marker won&#39;t appear.




It&#39;s then up to the player to interrogate their own survival knowledge and navigational skills to find the settlement. What kind of place would be ideal for a camp? What natural features might point to one? What telltale signs can they look for in order to help them spot it? Again, Exploration Mode is an ideal setting for players who prefer an immersive experience, and don&#39;t mind spending more time exploring.

Frontiers of Pandora still has a pretty expansive map, even if it&#39;s not the biggest in an Ubisoft game - that honor goes to Assassin&#39;s Creed: Valhalla. However, it feels much bigger than any waypoint-based game in Exploration Mode. When players must rely on their own senses to get around, and end up spending more time searching instead of pointing in one direction and walking in a straight line, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is at its most impressive and immersive.
