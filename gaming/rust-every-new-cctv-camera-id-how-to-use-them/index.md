## Literature Review

Since the game of Rust is all about safety and protection, assembling a CCTV camera setup can give you quite an advantage when taking big monuments.





Before placing any CCTV cameras, you must first build a Computer Station that unlocks the item hidden around all servers. Like many of the best base defenses in Rust, there are a few steps you must take to take full advantage of this item. A camera can be found near a crash site, in an Airdrop, or inside loot crates scattered throughout the sandbox world you explore.






One essential item you need at your base to set up a CCTV camera is some form of electrical output. This will grant power to the machine and allow it to operate without any issues.




                  Rust: 5 Essential Tips &amp; Tricks for New Players   Surviving in the world of Rust is a difficult and terrifying task. The following tips will assist the action and help players on their journey.   


 How To Make a Computer Station In Rust 
          

The blueprint for building a Computer Station is one of the default plans in the game, which asks you to put together 20 High-Quality Metal, 1 Targeting Computer, 1 Broadcaster, and 1 Receiver. These ingredients can be brought to a Level 1 Workbench to craft the right Station, which you will likely already have to make many other basic items in Rust during your adventure.




Every one of these parts is found in either Supply Drops or within Hidden Chests scattered around various Monument locations. Once you build your own Computer Station, place it somewhere in your base, fairly protected from outside enemies in Rust. You can enter different ID codes from the Station&#39;s main screen to gain different views on your map from the CCTV cameras you set up.

 All Camera Identifiers in Rust 
          

The initial screen for the Computer Station will be blank until you add an ID code in Rust. Go to the &#34;Identifier to Add&#34; tab in the bottom left corner of the main screen to make a prompt show up for your character. From here, you can type out codes without any grammar issues and have each ID you input saved on a list that you can simply select from the main screen from that point forward.






Not every server in Rust has Monuments with CCTV cameras you can access through a Computer Station. Some IDs listed cannot be used if the map you&#39;re playing on does not have a particular type of structure in the sandbox.

Anyone can put their surveillance tools around their base from the loose equipment found in their travels. When you use a CCTV camera at your home in Rust, and have ways to look through the others already on the map, you can be prepared for any threat that could come knocking at your door.
