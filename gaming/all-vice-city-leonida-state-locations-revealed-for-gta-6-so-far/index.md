## Literature Review

Grand Theft Auto 6 hasn&#39;t officially revealed information outside of the trailer, but that one source has a lot of interesting information to glean.




Grand Theft Auto 6 returns the crime saga from Rockstar Games to the setting of Vice City and Leonida at large, and it&#39;s possible to pick up on a number of returning locations from the franchise&#39;s original venture into the setting. The fictionalized version of Miami made its first appearance in the original Grand Theft Auto and took center stage in GTA: Vice City, while GTA 6 looks like it might also step outside of Vice City&#39;s borders to explore more of the pseudo-Florida known as Leonida.
Revisiting iconic Vice City locations in GTA 6 obviously puts a fresh coat of paint on them, as over 20 years have passed since GTA: Vice City was released on sixth-generation consoles. Much of what GTA 6 is including looks to be new; however, as reverence for the classic game isn&#39;t overriding any major plans for revitalized design. Hopefully, GTA 6 will be able to live up to and improve upon Vice City across the board in both new and returning locations, although it won&#39;t be possible to experience it firsthand until 2025.
            
 
 GTA 6&#39;s Setting &amp; Location: Everything We Know About Leonida &amp; Vice City 
GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. Drawing on the trailer, the original Vice City, and its real world basis, here’s what to expect from GTA 6’s map.












 








 10  Hotel Dixon 
Hotel Victor
        

Among the skyline visible from Vice Beach area in the trailer for GTA 6 available on the official Rockstar Games YouTube channel, one obvious standout is Hotel Dixon, which displays its name proudly in neon letters. Hotel Dixon is presumably based on the Hotel Victor along the real South Beach, which boasts a similar style both in construction and lettering. The real hotel first opened its doors in 1937 but later underwent significant renovations to achieve its current art-deco look, which works perfectly for the Vice City style.







 9  Stockyard/Downtown 
Districts Of Miami
        

Stockyard and Downtown seem to be districts of Vice City as shown on a highway sign in the GTA 6 trailer. Downtown would presumably correspond to downtown Miami, while Stockyard could be any number of districts, real or imagined. This isn&#39;t the most robust piece of information found in the trailer, but it&#39;s still a little extra knowledge to have handy.





 8  Luxury Stores 
Swarovski &amp; Other Retailers
        

A shopping center sign reveals a number of stores that can be expected to appear in GTA 6, although locking down the nature of every option isn&#39;t that simple. One easy guess is that &#34;Kowalski&#34; is a stand-in for the crystal jewelry chain Swarovski based on its name and logo, as well as a potential reference to a character in Rockstar&#39;s Bully. The name of the first store on the list is hard to decipher, but the font choice is reminiscent of Neiman Marcus. &#34;Callus&#34; could be a play on Sephora using a skin irritation as the name for a makeup store, and &#34;Skala&#34; might be an analogue for Prada.





 7  Functional Shops 
Big Daddy&#39;s Wine &amp; Liquor


 







Although it&#39;s hard to know if the stores that appear in the shopping center sign in the GTA 6 trailer will have much of a role to play in the game, there are a few from the trailer that seem important. GTA 6 protagonist Lucia and her partner rob a store called Uncle Jack&#39;s Liquor, which seems to be based on Big Daddy&#39;s Wine &amp; Liquors. A Pawn and Gun appears that could be a good place to pick up weapons. Vehicle customization is likely available from a place called Rideout Customs, which is referenced in decals on multiple vehicles.
            
 
 10 Real-Life Viral Moments Captured In The GTA 6 Trailer 
The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was packed with a ton of interesting scenes, some of which are based on viral real-life moments with a deeper story. 








 6  Catalan Boulevard 
Biscayne Boulevard
        

&#34;Catalan Blvd&#34; appears on a highway exit sign in the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, a deliberate inclusion that seemingly confirms the existence of a location under that name. No such place appeared in GTA: Vice City, but it seems likely that it&#39;s an analogue to the real Biscayne Boulevard in Miami. The word &#34;Biscayne&#34; refers to the people of the Basque Country in Spain, so substituting Catalan in reference to the people of Catalonia makes sense as a fairly direct parallel.
            
 
 What Platforms Will GTA 6 Release On? (Confirmed) 
Rockstar Games has confirmed the release date for the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, and what platforms it will be on at launch.








 5  Kelly County 
Unknown Florida County
        

Another interesting road sign clue in the GTA 6 trailer is &#34;Kelly County,&#34; which points to a location that likely isn&#39;t right next to the bounds of Vice City. It&#39;s not a name that&#39;s specific enough to make a real-world inspiration easy to pin down. Phonetic similarity could point to Collier County, as the game seems to have some interest in venturing into the Everglades for a change in scenery, but it&#39;s hard to make any definitive call.





 4  Vice-Dale County 
Miami-Dade County


 







While Kelly County&#39;s location is currently somewhat mysterious, Vice-Dale County is much easier to pin down. The name obviously draws from the real Miami-Dade County, where Miami is located, making Vice-Dale County the overarching geographical area where most of Grand Theft Auto 6 will presumably take place. Considering the way GTA geography tends to work, some other key locations will likely be folded into this county as well.





 3  Port VC/Keys 
Port Miami &amp; Florida Keys
        

&#34;Port VC/Keys&#34; is another useful bit of information gleaned from highway signs in the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer. In this case, there is actually some footage of boats speeding through a seaport that would appear to be Port VC, which is inspired by the real Port Miami. An overhead view likewise reveals a glimpse at the Keys, which are based on some of the tropical islands that run along the southern coast of Florida.





 2  VCI Airport 
Miami International Airport
        

The GTA 6 trailer shows &#34;VCI Airport&#34; on the same sign as Kelly County, presumably referring to a Vice City International Airport. In GTA: Vice City, the included airport was Escobar International, so it seems like there may have been a branding change involved. Vice City International is a more direct analogue in name to the real Miami International, but whether the game will reference the old name of Escobar or not remains to be seen in Grand Theft Auto 6.





 1  Vice Beaches 
Miami&#39;s Beaches


 







The Vice Beaches area is a central focus of the GTA 6 trailer, and it looks to be more impressive than ever before. This fictional rendition of Miami&#39;s beaches was generally sparsely filled in Vice City, as rendering accurate crowds for a packed beach would have been a difficult development task at the time. Grand Theft Auto 6 depicts a bustling area with varied NPCs going about individual tasks with unique animations, and areas like the boardwalk are even more impressive than the beach itself.
