## Literature Review

In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, players can search for the body parts of Dribbles the Clown. Seven body parts can be found all across Baldur&#39;s Gate and Rivington.





To start the quest to find Dribbles, visit the Circus of the Last Days in Rivington. The dimension-hopping Circus is visiting the Sword Coast, and there are many opportunities for the party to have fun. Players can trick a Djinni out of his jackpot, obtain a love reading for their chosen partner, and even commission a nude statue of themselves for camp. The main attraction is Dribbles’ show, which quickly goes wrong.

Most of these locations are fairly easy to find once you’ve entered the Lower City. However, you won’t be able to enter the Temple of Bhaal without completing the Investigate the Murders or Impress the Murder Tribunal main quests. These are rather tough and time-consuming quests, so ensure you’re well-prepared with a powerful set of high-level spells and abilities before entering the Temple.



 What To Do With Dribbles The Clown’s Body Parts In Baldur’s Gate 3 
          

Once you’ve collected all the body parts, bring your gruesome collectibles back to Lucretius at the Circus of the Last Days. She’ll be glad to have her clown back and plans to reanimate him with necromancy, so he can continue to entertain visitors.

She’ll also reward you with the Spellmight Gloves, which let the wearer take a -5 penalty to their spell attack rolls to deal an additional 1d8 damage. The Spellmight ability is fantastic for any spellcasters in your Baldur’s Gate 3 party, and the Gloves are a fine reward for helping to bring the clown back to the circus.
