## Literature Review

Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1&#39;s eight NPC Characters will trade useful items and perks to players in return for Gold Bars. Here&#39;s how to find them all.





NPCs in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 work exactly like NPCs from previous seasons of Fortnite, trading items and services for Gold Bars. There’s much on offer, ranging from basic healing and shield items to traversal equipment such as the Cluster Clinger. Some NPCs can also be recruited to join your squad as temporary battlefield allies.

The map above shows the locations of all eight NPC characters in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 1. If you still have trouble finding a particular NPC, check the list below.

 NPC  Image  Location  Items and Services   Sun Tan Specialist                        Patrolling the beach southwest of Pleasant Piazza and northwest of Snooty Steppes. There are some beachside cabins and a small boardwalk nearby.    Patch Up (100 Bars): Restores player health.   Medic Specialist (250 Bars): Recruit Sun Tan Specialist to your squad.

The entrance to the room is roughly halfway down the tunnel    Prop Disguise (50 Bars): Transform into a prop.   Cluster Clinger x2 (200 Bars)      Hope                        Inside a hidden room in the railway tunnel northwest of Hazy Hillside. The entrance to the room is roughly halfway down the tunnel.    Rift To Go (250 Bars)   Grapple Blade (400 Bars)      Snow Striker                        Found at a small camp on a mountainside slope south of Grand Glacier.

Shield Potion (125 Gold Bars)      






Players can also track down and fight five NPC bosses: Oscar, Nisha, Montague, Valeria, and Family Guy’s Peter Griffin. If you’ve ever challenged Fortnite’s Wildguard Relik to a boss fight, you will have a good idea of what to expect: a challenging fight against a tough AI-controlled enemy.



These bosses drop Society Medallions when defeated. These regenerate Shields when stored in your inventory, but also mark your location for other players. The more Medallions you carry, the faster your Shields regenerate, but your location will also be marked with greater precision.






 The Best NPCs To Visit In Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 
          

All of Fortnite’s new NPCs have something to offer, but it’s generally best to prioritize equipment that’s harder to find. For instance, trading 125 Gold Bars for a Shield Potion from Mecha Team Shadow would be bad, as Shield Potions are extremely common drops. However, trading 50 Gold Bars for a Prop Disguise from Vengeance Jones could give you a valuable advantage in tight combat encounters.






Many of the NPC Characters appear in the latest Battle Pass as Outfits, so if you’ve subscribed to the Fortnite Crew this month, you can visit them to see how they look in-game.




You will also want to prioritize NPCs you can recruit to your squad. They’re surprisingly capable in battle, and having an extra gun can make all the difference. If you’re spending your Gold Bars wisely, Fortnite’s NPCs can put you well ahead of your competition.
